This anthology of Paracelsus' writings is an important addition to the series. Paracelsus has remained a legend from his own times down to our own; his name appears in almost every standard history of magic, alchemy, and occultism; and he is regarded, with varying degrees of justification, as the founder of modern medicine and a pioneer of homoeopathy. The image of the heaven-storming magus bent over his ves­ sels and furnace, surrounded by great tomes filled with arcane knowledge, astrological symbols, and strange sigils, immor ­ talized in the Faust plays of Marlowe and Goethe, is directly inspired by the life and work of Paracelsus. But there is also another Paracelsus, or rather many — the Renaissance naturalist of the two worlds, the macrocosm and the microcosm; the adventurer and traveller in all the lands of Europe; the boisterous iconoclast ot the learned academics; the charitable physician ministering to the poor and humble; the brave emissary in towns stricken by the plague; and the lonely figure wandering in the vast snowy wastes of the Alps and preaching the gospel in remote Swiss villages.

Today he is cele ­ brated as the first modern medical theorist, the founder of iatrochcmistry, homoeopathy, antisepsis, and modern wound surgery. He rejected the book-learning and scholasticism of ancient and medieval medicine in favour of a new medicine based on experiment, observation, and new philosophy. Nature and man, not ancient texts, were his sources: he believed that a pious Christian faith, the evidence of his own senses, and a system of correspondences between the macrocosm and the microcosm surpassed the knowledge gleaned from the writings ot Hippocrates, Galen, and Avicenna. He saw the philosopher- physician as a guide in the realm of Nature, an explorer in the divine totality of the heavens, the earth, and man. His astro ­ logical, alchemical, and occult insights were rooted in the con ­ temporary philosophy of Renaissance neo-Platonism, natural magic, and cabbalism. His radical approach to healing and medicine, his popular style and contempt for professional exclu ­ sivity and incompetence provoked the hostility of established authorities everywhere. He was called the Luther of physicians on account of his strident opposition to existing medical prac ­ tice, coupled with a demand for change and reform.

Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohen ­ heim, called Paracelsus, was born at Einsiedcln, the important monastery village and place of pilgrimage in the canton of Schwyz in Switzerland, in 1493. His father, Wilhelm Bombastus von Hohenheim, was the illegitimate son of a nobleman and knight-errant from Swabia, while his mother was a bonds ­ woman of the great Benedictine abbey in the village. Their only child was christened Theophrastus; the other names were attributed only later and it was not until 1529 that he used the name Paracelsus, probably to signify ‘ surpassing Celsus ’ (the Roman writer on medicine), by which he is best known. His mother died when he was still young, and in 1502, as a result of the Swabian wars, father and son moved to Villach in Carin- thia, which Paracelsus described as ‘ my second fatherland, next to the country of my birth ’ . Here Wilhelm von Hohenheim practised medicine, a respected member of the community, for the rest of his life. He encouraged his son ’ s interest in natural history and taught him the rudiments of medicine. Paracelsus probably attended the monastery schools of St Paul and St Andrae near Klagenfurt. Lastly, the local mining school of the Fuggcrs and their metal ore mines at Paternion, Bleiberg, and Hutcnberg near Villach offered both father and son a rich field for chemical and medical observation and speculation. Here, and later as an apprentice in the mines of Sigmund Ftiger at Schwaz in Tyrol, Paracelsus received a strong impetus towards alchemy and his vocation for natural science and medicine. Besides the scanty notes in Paracelsus ’ own writings, little is known of his early life, education, and travels. He identified among his tutors four bishops and Johannes Trithemius, abbot of Sponhcim (1461-1516), a famous cabbalist. As regards his education after the monastery and mining schools, Paracelsus probably studied for a bachelor ’ s degree at Vienna between 1509 and 1512. Determined to become a physician, Paracelsus then journeyed to Italy and began studying at Ferrara in 1513. Here he heard the lectures of Johannes Menardus (1462-1536), an opponent ol astrology in medicine, and Nicolaus Lconicc- nus (1428-1524), the medical humanist and critic. Paracelsus"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"______________ THE LIFE OF PARACELSUS _______________ 15 concluded his studies and received his doctorate at Ferrara in 1516. Although he mentioned many of the famous German, Italian, French, and Spanish universities in his work, it seems likely that he only visited them in the course of his later travels; moreover, Paracelsus was generally critical of academic medi ­ cine and its scholastic exegesis of ancient Greek and Arabic texts. Paracelsus sought a universal knowledge, a knowledge that was not to be found in the books or the faculties. The young doctor now embarked on a series of extensive travels around Europe. Between 1517 and 1524 these wanderings led him from Italy across France to Spain and Portugal, through France again, then to England, Germany, Scandinavia, Poland, Russia, Hun ­ gary, Croatia, across to Italy and thence to Rhodes, Constan ­ tinople and, possibly, Egypt. During this period he enlisted as an army surgeon and was involved in the wars waged by Venice, Holland, Denmark, and the Tartars. Now Paracelsus was motivated by the practical experience of surgery and the great wealth of local and traditional medical folklore among the herb-women, bath attendants, peasants, gypsies, and magi ­ cians encountered in the course of his travels. Paracelsus ’ life was indeed unconventional from the outset. Initially he had been tutored by ecclesiastics, some with pan- sophic and cabbalistic interests, while his practical bent inclined him towards natural history, medicine, and mining. He had then studied at universities, first in the general arts and then for his doctorate in medicine. But his studies were not followed by academic preferment or settling down to practise. Instead, he spent almost a decade travelling far and wide in pursuit of more knowledge, while practising the artisan trade of surgery. How ­ ever, these were turbulent times: new continents were being discovered, traditions and faith were under challenge from the new learning of the Renaissance, and population and new trade and industry were expanding across Europe. Paracelsus ’ early life reflects the energy and restlessness of this era, whose inno ­ vation and change offered a rich harvest of experience to any ­ one prepared to travel and observe a wider new world. Paracelsus wanted to found a new medicine which would merge its academic and artisan traditions of learning and prac ­ tice. This unconventional ambition was his destiny, the prin-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"16 ______________________ PARACELSUS _______________________ cipal motive and cause of his chequered career. In advocating a unified medical science, Paracelsus was striking against the strong professional codes and vested interests of physicians, sur ­ geons, and apothecaries. In late medieval Europe physicians were learned scholars and it was beneath their dignity to attend at the sick-bed; on the other hand, barber-surgeons were merely plying a parochial and humble artisan trade, uninformed by theory. Apothecaries made a good living from the herbal reme­ dies of Galen and Avicenna, still upheld by the scholar- physicians. Thus Paracelsus ’ medical reforms represented a threat to all these groups, making his life a series of fateful clashes wherever he attempted to settle down and practise. In the course of 1524 Paracelsus returned from his wide- ranging travels that had lasted seven years to his Carinthian homeland. After visiting his father at Villach and finding no local opportunity to practise, he settled down as a physician in Salzburg. Since 1519/20 he had been working on his first medical writings, and he now completed these as Elf Traktat and Volumen medicinae Paramirum , which describe eleven com ­ mon maladies and their treatment and his early medical prin ­ ciples. At the same time, Paracelsus felt a deep sympathy for the downtrodden common people, as confirmed by his later religious and socio-political writings. His ethical speculations were in line with those of the Brethren of the Free Spirit, the Anabaptists, and other sectarian exponents of radicalism and popular pantheism in the late Middle Ages and on the eve of the Reformation. At Salzburg in 1525 Paracelsus supported the cause of rebellious peasants, was arrested, and only narrowly escaped the death penalty. He fled westwards, visiting the spas ot Swabia and Baden along the Danube, where he studied the thermal waters and their healing virtues. In December 1526 Paracelsus arrived at Strasburg and entered his name in the town register. He was thus entitled to perma ­ nent residence and free to join the guild of surgeons and trades ­ men. Although there was an acrimonious dispute with a surgeon called Wendelin Hock, Paracelsus seems to have enjoyed popularity and respect at Strasburg. Most important for him was his contact with the influential circle of Protestant reformers at Strasburg, including Nicolaus Gerbelius, Kaspar Hedio, Wolf-"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"______________ THE LIFE OF PARACELSUS _______________ 17 gang Capito, and Johannes Oecolampadius, the famous re­ former at Basle. Paracelsus successfully treated Hedio, who was the close friend of Capito, the leading light at Strasburg. Capito, in turn, introduced Paracelsus to the humanist circles of Basle. From the middle of January until the end of February 1527, Paracelsus visited Basle. The centre of the humanist movement here was the publisher Froben. Paracelsus stayed at his house, effected a successful cure of his long-standing leg ailment, and became acquainted with his friends Erasmus of Rotterdam and the Amerbach brothers. Although Paracelsus was a Roman Catholic, his friendship with progressive circles and sympa ­ thy for the Reformation, his medical proficiency, and his oppo ­ sition to medieval scholastic medicine commended him alike to humanists, reformed churchmen, and the public. Oecolam ­ padius, the Protestant theologian, was highly influential in the Basle town council and secured the appointment of Paracelsus as town physician in March 1527. Paracelsus spent only ten months at Basle, but this period marks both the climax and the crisis of his life. The post of town physician was a municipal appointment, but it also car ­ ried the commission and right to lecture at the university. This prospect held great appeal for Paracelsus, who sought an audience for his ideas on the new medicine. However, the university authorities had not been consulted over his appoint ­ ment, and Paracelsus irritated them further by refusing to submit to the formal act of reception as an external graduate. Instead, he challenged the university by issuing an iconoclastic mani ­ festo, the Intimatio, in which he promised to lecture daily for two hours on practical and theoretical medicine, not after Hippocrates and Galen (the recognized academic authorities), but on the basis of his own experience and work. Next, on 24 June (St John ’ s Day), Paracelsus contributed to the student rag festivities by burning publicly the fat volume of Avicenna, the canon of scholastic medicine. The faculty reacted by dis ­ puting his right to lecture and sponsor doctoral candidates. Paracelsus lodged a protest with the town council and simul ­ taneously complained about the bad practices of the apothe ­ caries, thereby ensuring himself more enemies. The town council supported him and he continued to lecture on such sub-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"18 ______________________ PARACELSUS _______________________ jccts as tumours and wounds, purges, uroscopy, pulse diagno ­ sis, and his work De Physiognomic! before large and enthusiastic audiences, which included both students and non-academic barber-surgeons. In a further break with tradition, Paracelsus gave many of his lectures in German rather than Latin, an unprecedented practice at the universities in his time and obvi ­ ously intended as a popular challenge to the exclusivity and elitism of academic medicine. In these lectures Paracelsus was forming the nucleus of his medical system during a highly fruitful phase of his life. How ­ ever, his antagonizing of the faculty led to a bitter harvest. His position at Basle was seriously undermined by the death of Froben in October 1527. A damaging lampoon soon followed, ridiculing Paracelsus ’ terminology and extolling the wisdom of Galen against the ‘ Cacophrastus ’ (from the Greek kakos, bad) Paracelsus. Again Paracelsus complained to the town council (December 1527) but this time the complaint was shelved. A further incident hastened his fall. When Paracelsus cured a rich church dignitary, who had offered him a colossal reward of a hundred guilders, the patient paid only a small sum. Paracelsus complained, as a matter of principle, to a court, which awarded him just a modest fee. Paracelsus was incensed and accused the magistrate of ignorance and injustice, thereby laying himself open to arrest and severe punishment. On the advice of his few remaining friends, Paracelsus left Basle secretly in early February 1528. Thus ended his great period of promise and rejection, honour and disgrace. Deeply disappointed by his experiences at Basle, Paracelsus set off on a renewed series of travels in southern Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. During his period of restless wan ­ dering from town to town, which filled the remaining fifteen years of his life, Paracelsus was to write and complete many major books on medicine, philosophy, and theology. From Basle he travelled via Colmar and Esslingen, arriving at Nurem ­ berg in 1529. Paracelsus had great expectations of this flourish ­ ing centre of commerce, art, and religious reformers. However, his reputation preceded him and the physicians closed ranks against him. Paracelsus provoked them further by offering to cure any patient deemed incurable and promptly succeeded with"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"______________ THE LIFE OF PARACELSUS _______________ 19 nine out of fifteen lepers. He also antagonized the Lutheran circles in the city by disassociating himself from Lutheran reforms, for he believed in an extreme formulation of the independence of free will and was an advocate of the common people. But his bitterest quarrel at Nuremberg concerned his book on syphilis, then known as the French Disease, which was newly introduced from the West Indies, causing a fierce epidemic. Contemporary treatment consisted of mercury or a preparation of the American guaiac or pock wood, which was ineffective but brought substantial revenues to the Fuggers of Augsburg, who held the guaiac import monopoly. Paracelsus had already written a critical treatise on the guaiac remedy, and in 1529 he had printed the first volume of an ambitious eight- volume work on the French Disease. Once again Paracelsus was threatening powerful vested interests in his pursuit of med ­ ical science. It was an unequal battle: he was forced to leave Nuremberg and his pioneering work was banned by the censors. Paracelsus now sought peace in the small country town of Beratzhausen, where he entered his most productive phase of medical literary activity. Firstly, he wrote the Paragranum (1529- 30), intended as a book ‘ beyond the grain ’ . In this he demanded that medicine should be based on four pillars: natural philo ­ sophy, Astronomy (the relationship between man and the heavens), Alchemy (the science and preparation of chemical remedies), and Virtue (the inherent power of the particular individual, doctor, patient, herb, or metal). The book was in ­ troduced by the famous prefaces bristling with vigorous polemics against traditional medicine and its scholastic high priests. In Beratzhausen Paracelsus also resumed religious preaching, which he had practised earlier in Salzburg. He con ­ tinued preaching at St Gallen, where he stayed next. Here he completed his great Opus Paramirum — the ‘ work beyond wonder ’ — in 1531. This book contains Paracelsus ’ mature med ­ ical theories, including expositions of his theory of three sub ­ stances (Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury), a chemical system of medicine which Paracelsus substituted for the ancient doctrine of the four elements; the processes of digestion and nutrition; the nature of women; the matrix (womb), sexuality, and repro-"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"20 ______________________ PARACELSUS _______________________ duction; diseases due to ‘ tartar ’ (stone); psychic phenomena and illnesses arising from the imagination. He dedicated the work to Vadianus, the humanist and former Rector of Vienna Univer ­ sity, now acting mayor of St Gallen. Paracelsus benefited from Vadianus ’ introductions, effected many successful cures, and stayed in St Gallen for more than two years. At this time he also began his writings on comets and other heavenly signs of 1531 and 1532. Close to Protestant thinkers and critical of the Papacy, Paracelsus regarded these phenomena as apocalyptic signs and warnings from God concerning man ’ s wars and wickedness. Yet again his restless nature drove him onwards. In 1533 he wandered as a poor lay preacher and healer among the Swiss peasants of the Appenzeller country. During this period of retreat in the snowy Alps and the rude villages he wrote many of his short theological and socio-political treatises, including Liber prologi in vitam beatam, De religione perpetua and De ordine doni. After many months in the mountains of Tyrol he reached Innsbruck clad as a beggar. From here he visited the familiar mining districts of his apprenticeship at Schwaz and wrote his work on the Miners ’ Disease — the first treatise in medical liter ­ ature to recognize and analyse an occupational disease. By 1534 he had crossed the Brenner Pass and in June he reached Sterz- ing (Vipiteno). The small town was in the throes of the plague, which Paracelsus had already encountered during his earlier travels. With no reward he worked courageously among the poor, sick, and dying, bringing relief as best he could with his remedies. He also wrote a little book about his experience with the disease, its diagnosis, and a series of counsels regarding its treatment and a number of prescriptions. He presented this to the mayor but received scant acknowledgement from the town authorities, who were probably mistrustful of his threadbare appearance and practical involvement. Paracelsus now proceeded southwards to Meran, where he came into contact with a religio-social revolutionary group of Anabaptists, before making his way into the Veltlin (Valtellina), which he praised as the healthiest region in all Europe. He also commended the spring waters of St Moritz for their beneficial effect upon gout and the digestion. From St Moritz he went"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"______________ THE LIFE OF PARACELSUS _______________ 21 to Bad Pfafcrs, spending the summer of 1535 at the monastery there. He devoted a special pamphlet to the healing properties of the thermal springs in this spa town. Together with his earlier studies of the spas in Swabia and Baden, this medical work establishes his reputation as the founder of balneology. Before leaving the monastery Paracelsus wrote a short consilium for the abbot, Johann Jakob Russinger. Journeying northwards again, he left his native Switzerland and travelled through the Allgau district of Bavaria via Isny, Kempten, and Memmingen, arriving in Ulm at the beginning of 1536. Here he arranged for the printing of his great work on surgery, Diegrosse Wundarznei, on which he had been work ­ ing for several years. However, the work did not progress to his satisfaction, so he entrusted the task to Heinrich Steiner at Augsburg (July-August 1536), who brought out the first and second books. The work was an immediate success and was reprinted a year later. In the same months he also published his Prognostication for the next 24 years , a book of political and religious predictions, which he dedicated to his patron King Ferdinand I of Austria, the brother of the Emperor Charles V. From Augsburg he travelled by way of Nordlingen, Munich, and Passau to Mahrisch Kromau, where he had been invited to a consultation with Johann von dcr Leipnik, a high digni ­ tary of the Kingdom of Bohemia. As a patron of persecuted Protestant sects in Bohemia, Leipnik took a strong interest in the philosophical ideas of his physician. He invited Paracelsus to stay on at Kromau as his guest and advance his written works. Paracelsus accepted this offer and began his great philosophi ­ cal opus Astronomia Magna or the whole Philosophia Sagax of the Great and Little World (1537-8). This presented a systematic account of Paracelsus ’ scientific world-view based on the macrocosm-microcosm correspondences of Renaissance neo- Platonism, including his classification of nine members (branches of knowledge) in each of the four varieties of Astron ­ omy, which he understood as the study of the totality of the heavens and the earth. After his stay at Mahrisch Kromau, Paracelsus visited Press- burg (Bratislava), where a ceremonial dinner was held in his honour at the end of September 1537. At this time he appears"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"22 ______________________ PARACELSUS _______________________ to have recovered the reputation and wealth which he had either lost or forgone during this Swiss and Tyrol period. At his next sojourn in Vienna he was even granted two audiences with King Ferdinand. But in the midst of these successes there are still reports of strife with authorities and a scries of disputes with the Austrian treasury. In May 1538 he returned to his old home town, Villach, and dedicated his ‘ Carinthian trilogy ’ to the estates of the archduchy. This trilogy comprised a chronicle of Carinthia, the medical work Labyrinthus medicorum errantium , and an apologia pro vita sua, the Siebeti Defensiones. The dedica ­ tion was graciously acknowledged by the estates and an early printing promised. Now Paracelsus wandered in the ‘ desert region ’ around St Veit and Klagenfurt, while completing Philosophia Sagax. By now his health had broken down, so that, exceptionally, he declined to travel to a consultation with a nobleman in Pcttau (Ptuj). In late 1540, however, aid seemed to be at hand, for he was invited to settle at Salzburg by the bishop suffragan, Ernst von Wittelsbach. But Paracelsus was not granted a lengthy respite. Following a stroke on 21 Sep ­ tember 1541 at Salzburg, he dictated his will, bequeathing his modest possessions of a little money, some clothing, and bib ­ lical scripture to the poor.

He broke with the closed hierarchial structures of medieval thought and deter ­ mined to explore and describe the natural world. His enter ­ prise was inspired by the Renaissance neo-Platonic conception that the whole of creation — the heavens, the earth, and all Nature — represented a macrocosm, and that its unity was reflected in a variety of possible microcosms, of which man was the most perfect. The analogies and correspondences between the macrocosm and the microcosm were central to his cosmology, theology, natural philosophy, and medicine. Such analogical speculation was present in Greek philosophy and throughout the Middle Ages, but Paracelsus was the first to apply this approach systematically to the study of Nature. These neo-Platonic ideas also underpinned his theory of know ­ ledge. Paracelsus expressed a deep distrust of logical and rational thought as a scientific tool. Since man was the climax of crea ­ tion, uniting within himself all the constituents of the world, he could have direct knowledge of Nature on account of a sym ­ pathy between the inner representative of a particular object in his own constitution and its external counterpart. For Para­ celsus, this union with the object is the principal means of acquiring intimate and total knowledge. Moreover, this true knowledge docs not concern the brain, the seat of conscious rational thinking, but rather the whole person."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"24 ______________________ PARACELSUS _______________________ Paracelsus was above all a naturalist. He set out to explore how Nature works and to discover the eternal laws by which it is governed. The work of Nature consitutes a visible reflec­ tion of the invisible work of God. Nature thus provides signs by means of which God grants a glimpse into His secret wis ­ dom and design. Paracelsus ’ conception of Nature was rooted in his cosmological and theological ideas. Whereas God had created natural objects such as stars, herbs, and stones, He did not create their ‘ virtues ’ (essential activity or power). Prior to all creation these uncreated virtues had always been in God; in the course of creation they were distributed in the natural world as direct emanations of God. Just as all virtues in natural objects arc divine and supernatural, so human ability and wis ­ dom are also gifts from God. Paracelsus thus exhorts man to ‘ seek, knock and find ’ and further his knowledge of Nature as a religious duty to understand the work of God. The wonders of God, the cures, and the arcana (secret remedies) are lavished upon the natural world all around us. Nature can reveal these signs of God. The naturalist is engaged in an empirical search for the divine seals in Nature. This empirical search was a mode of enquiry quite opposed to the medieval concern with an intellectual mastery of ancient authorities and traditional texts. Paracelsus contrasted his own notions of experience and science with that pseudo-knowledge based on logic and reasoning, an elaboration of abstract categories and models of reality bearing little relation to the actual objects, influences, and events in the external world. He rejected scholatic book-learning and its slavish dependence on the old ideas and systems of Aristotle (384-322 BC), Galen (c. 129-199), and Avicenna (980-1037). In accordance with Gnostic ideas, Paracelsus conceived of all creation having two sides: a visible elemental (material) part and an invisible superelemen- tal (astral) part. Man, the microcosm, likewise possesses a car ­ nal elemental body and an astral body ( corpus sidereum ) which ‘ teaches man ’ and is able to communicate with the astral part of the macrocosm, the uncreated virtues or direct emanations of God in the world of Nature. He saw experience as a process of identification of the mind or astral body with the internal knowledge possessed by natural objects in attaining their speci-"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE PHILOSOPHY, MEDICINE, AND THEOLOGY_25 fic ends. The researcher should try to ‘ overhear ’ the knowledge of the star, herb, or stone with respect to its activity or func ­ tion. Science is thus already present as a virtue in the natural object, and it is the experience of the researcher which uncovers the astral sympathy between himself and the object. This iden ­ tification with an object penetrates more deeply into the essence of the object than mere sensory perception. Paracelsus ’ science is both profound and holistic in its approach to Nature. Magic was an essential part of Renaissance neo-Platonic philosophy, first exemplified in the influential works of Mar- silio Ficino (1433-99). Magic in this context does not mean the cultivation of demons, but the capture and direction of the divine virtues in natural objects for the benefit of man. This ‘ natural magic ’ was fundamental to Paracelsus ’ world-view and science. Firstly, magic reveals the invisible influences between things, providing the basis of medicine, philosophy, and astron ­ omy. Secondly, magic is an action or practice, by means of which the magus can bring heavenly forces down to earth, into himself, or on to other objects, which thus acquire the power of the transferred virtue, be it from a star, a plant, a gem, or any other natural object. The magus requires a strong mind in which the heavenly and earthly forces are balanced and com ­ bined. His power is spiritual and superior to matter and the elements. He becomes at least the equal of Nature and can achieve wonders with the aid of the virtues he has mastered. The magus can also transmute objects, transfer power, act at a distance, and predict events. Impressed by Ficino ’ s idea of the priest-physician, Paracelsus saw the physician as a magus who knows all the virtues of herbs, minerals, and other objects.

Paracelsus ’ insistence on the union of researcher and object and his belief in natural magic strike the modern mind as sub ­ jective.

By contrast, mystical and magical modes of thought seek similarities, sympathies, and ‘ wholes ’ in Nature and the cosmos. Paracelsus ’ notion of experience, his advocacy of homoeopathy, his doctrine of ‘ signatures ’ (whereby the form of an object symbolizes its virtue or essential action), all indi ­ cate a holistic world-view based on the traditions of Gnosti ­ cism and the Cabbala. His rejection of abstract reason and logic as a distorted model of reality and his search for similarities and symbolical correspondences between the macrocosm and the microcosm led him towards a more empirical view ot Nature and a sensitive apprehension of the world about us. The map is not the territory, but Paracelsus ’ map certainly repre ­ sented a closer approximation to Nature than the constructs of medieval philosophy. Moreover, the spiritual relation between man and the cosmos was central to his science of the symbol, whereas this vision was lost in the science of the sys ­ tem from the seventeenth century onwards. The terms ‘ astral ’ and ‘ heavenly ’ occur frequently in Para ­ celsus ’ account ot correspondences between the macrocosm and the microcosm and also in his Gnostic dualism regarding the two sides of creation: visible and invisible; elemental and celes ­ tial; carnal and spiritual. Given this constant reference to the astra (stars), one may ask how he viewed them. Paracelsus appeared to break with medieval astrology by asserting the limitation of astral powers: individual stars determined neither man ’ s nature nor his behaviour, nor even the length of his life. However, Paracelsus could not dispense altogether with the stars in his scheme of the macrocosm and the microcosm. The visi­ ble stars had no causal influence, but their power lay in the heavenly co-ordination and correspondences between objects and phenomena. Once Paracelsus described this astral concor ­ dance as a portrait of human affairs in the heavens; also that the heavens represent a ‘ prelude ’ (prophecy as opposed to cause) relating to man ’ s life and actions. He noted a correspondence between each planet and a particular seat of disease. He further ­ more maintained that the stars could help direct the virtues of remedies to the diseased organ in the body. The physician should thus know how to bring about a concordance between"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"the planet and the remedial herb. However, this subtle distinc ­ tion between astral action and correspondence is blurred in his Philosophici Saga. v, where descriptions of astral ‘ inclination ’ and ‘ impression ’ jostle with notions of free will. The question whether Paracelsus embraced or rejected astrology cannot be answered simply. But such a question fails to comprehend Paracelsus ’ new approach to Nature and the essence of Renaissance neo-Platonism. Paracelsus used the term astrum to denote not only a celestial body (star or planet), but the ‘ astral ’ , divine, and invisible virtue or activity essential to any natural object. While ancient and medieval astrology attrib ­ uted a dominant and causal role to the stars in a strictly hierar ­ chical conception of the cosmos and creation, Paracelsus ushers in a new age by bringing those powers down to earth and dis ­ tributing them in divine virtues, signs, and seals throughout the natural world. In this way he shifts attention from the traditonal generality of medieval cosmology towards the local, the specific, and the empirical. During the Renaissance man was now looking all around himself to discover the powers of Nature and how it works. Man and Nature consequently enter into an active relationship rather than remaining the passive objects of transcendental power, be this God or the stars above. Paracelsus developed a theory of matter from these new philosophical ideas. Here again one can see how he moved towards an empirical concern with specifics. Medieval science, largely based on Aristotle and the translations of his works by the medieval Arab philosopher Avicenna, still accorded the four Elements — Earth, Water, Fire, and Air — a pre-eminent posi ­ tion in the theory of matter. The qualities of a substance or an object were deemed to reveal its elemental nature: cold and dry (Earth), cold and moist (Water), hot and dry (Fire), and hot and moist (Air). Although these four Elements still feature in Paracelsus ’ theory, they are no longer the last and irreducible components of matter. He thought that an immanent, specific, and soul-like force determined the nature and species of an object rather than its (visible) chemical components. For him, substances were but crude envelopes which disguised an under ­ lying pattern of spiritual forces and it was this pattern, not the corporeal cover, which dictated the composition of matter. __ THE PHILOSOPHY, MEDICINE, AND THEOLOGY __ 27"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"28 ______________________ PARACELSUS _ ______________________ Paracelsus generally ‘ spiritualized ’ matter, in claiming that such spiritual forces are the true elements and principles, while the Elements and chemical substances are only the crystallized deposits of such forces. Taking the notion of Prime Matter ( ‘ Arche ’ or ‘ Ousia ’ ) from ancient Stoicism, Paracelsus regarded the visible Elements as the results of an interaction between the qualities of heat, cold, moisture, and dryness and this Prime Matter, a kind of vital matter-spirit. According to Paracelsus, God created things in their ‘ prime ’ , but not in their ‘ ultimate ’ matter. Paracelsus viewed all Nature as in process of transformation, whereby all objects are being perfected. He personalized the principle responsible for this process as Vulcan, an immanent virtue or power which works in the matrices (the traditional Elements) of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. In this task Vulcan is assisted by two further powers or principles. Firstly, it needs to draw upon a reservoir of energy, which is necessary for the nourishment, growth, and preser ­ vation of all natural things. Paracelsus called this general reser ­ voir the Iliastcr . , a type of primordial matter-energy which essen ­ tially is and expresses the entire potential of all nature. Secondly, since Vulcan draws upon a general resource, it requires a specific agent to impress the specific and individual attributes upon the elemental material world. This agent was known as the Archeus. Paracelsus described both Vulcan and the Archeus metaphori ­ cally as workmen, craftsmen, and alchemists perfecting prime matter into ultimate matter, whether in Nature at large or in the human body. These concepts show again how Paracelsus was not interested in identifying units of matter, but was search ­ ing for the ‘ intelligences ’ or semina (seeds) in matter, which as archei are responsible for all specificity in Nature. Paracelsus accorded a central importance to Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury as the Three Principles of which all bodies con ­ sist. One would be mistaken if one thought that Paracelsus was referring here to the chemical substances known as sulphur, salt, and mercury. He used these terms to denote principles of constitution, representing organization (Sulphur), mass (Salt), and activity (Mercury), all varieties of the specific forms achieved by the immanent intelligences and semina of matter. But Paracelsus also used the terms in a chemical context: Sul ­"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE PHILOSOPHY, MEDICINE, AND THEOLOGY __ 29 phur represents the combustible. Mercury the smoky or vola ­ tile, and Salt the unchangeable component in any natural object. These principles are disclosed when the elemental cover is removed. For instance, when a piece of wood is burned one sees flame (Sulphur) and smoke (Mercury), while only ash (Salt) remains. These principles of constitution, together with the complex scheme of intelligences and semina, the Vulcan, the Waster, and the Archeus, are the dominant concepts in Paracelsus ’ theory of matter-energy and the process of life, while the ancient Elements are relegated to a secondary function as matrices, vehicles, or even mere covers for the active spiritual forces. Ancient Greek medicine, deriving from Hippocrates and Galen, was based on a theory of the four chief fluids or humours of the body (blood, phlegm, yellow and black bile), which were supposed to determine the temperament of the individual. A predominance of blood over the other humours produced a ruddy complexion and a courageous, hopeful, amorous dis ­ position; too much phlegm resulted in calmness, then sluggish ­ ness and apathy; yellow bile or choler caused anger and irascibility; black bile or melancholy produced introspection, sadness, and depression. Galen attributed disease to an upset of the humoral equilibrium, whereby there was an excess or deficit of one of the humours and the qualities of heat, cold, moisture, and dryness. Disease was a matter of ‘ distemper ’. Medieval medicine, represented by the works of Galen and Avicenna, had built up an elaborate pharmacology of herbal remedies for numerous degrees of humoral imbalance, based on logical and rational extrapolations from a limited amount of original observation. On the one hand, this scholastic medi ­ cine produced the remote and bookish physician of the Middle Ages who expounded theory but did not actually treat patients; on the other hand, the apothecaries dealt in an endless variety of herbs and other remedies which had little or no relation to the disease and often made the patient ’ s condition worse. The ideas and developments of Paracelsus ’ theory of matter arc plainly evident in his pioneering medicine. He opposed and destroyed the ancient humoral medicine and related ideas. He denied that the four humours and temperaments could explain"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"30 ______________________ PARACELSUS _______________________ the wide variety of diseases. He rejected the paramount impor ­ tance of the constitution and its internal order in ancient pathol ­ ogy. Instead, Paracelsus developed a medical theory which related the macrocosm and microcosm, while building on his dynamic notions of matter and energy. There were two impor ­ tant consequences: firstly, Paracelsus saw disease as something which affects the body from outside rather than as an internal imbalance; secondly, this wider relationship between man and the external world led to a search for specific cures and reme ­ dies relating to particular diseases and disorders. Paracelsus also used chemical remedies, based on his speculations concerning Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury, with far more promising results than the effects of the old Galenic herbs. For this reason, Paracelsus is often hailed as the founder of modern medicine and iatrochcmistry. In his theory of matter, Paracelsus had invoked the Elements as matrices in which semina could thrive and proceed towards specific forms. But there is a total sum of species ( Iliadus ) which can be generated by the principles (Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury) in any given matrix. Thus there is an Iliadus of Earth, Water, Fire, and Air. But since man represents a microcosmic matrix, there is also an Iliadus of man. Just as the Iliadus of an elemen ­ tal matrix grows ‘ species ’ and ‘ fruits ’ with the aid of Vulcan and the Archeus, so the human Iliadus is liable to produce fruits, which can bring forth an excess of what is typically integrated or absorbed in the course of organic bodily processes. Para­ celsus ’ pathology thus rehearses his dynamic theory of matter, whereby the three principles of constitution can direct condi ­ tions in the body in a manner comparable to their operation in an elemental matrix. Diseases are specific ‘ species ’ or ‘ fruits ’ which grow in the organs of the body. Natural objects and diseases differ according to the inter ­ action of the three principles of constitution with their corres ­ ponding matrices. This process of interaction occurs in the universe, thus generating the myriad species ot objects, and like ­ wise in the body, whereby the disease-species are generated. The same process also generates the herbs and minerals — typically from the elemental matrices of Earth and Water — together with their powerful virtues in the world of Nature."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"__ THE PHILOSOPHY, MEDICINE, AND THEOLOGY __ 31 While Paracelsus ’ new chemical medicine still explains pathol ­ ogy in terms of changes in matter, he is primarily concerned with salt and other chemicals — not as substances but as prin ­ ciples — and their relation to the function, power, or virtue inherent in matter, the body, and the arcana. It is thus the task of the physician to identify and understand these virtues and arcana in relation to a particular disease in a specific organ within the matrix of man. Physicians endowed with the powers of magic and the Cabbala will themselves act as Archei in the restoration of health. The medicine of Paracelsus is mainly represented in this volume by readings from ElfTraktat, Volumeti medicinae Parami- rum, and the Opus Paramirum. Here one can deduce his extraor ­ dinary advances in medical thinking beyond the formulae and systems of humoralism. Paracelsus propounds a medicine which leads to the localization of disease. He distinguishes diseases according to the different organs affected, their different ana ­ tomical changes, and the different exogenous causes. Paracelsus dispenses with the tortuous humoralist theories which are necessary to explain, for example, how black bile from the spleen causes ulcers on the leg. He secs a specific disease and proposes a specific remedy. Since diseases are ‘ species ’ or ‘ fruits ’ distributed throughout mankind, there is an aetiology or science of their anatomy, causes, and treatments. By contrast, ancient pathology only recognized general ‘ distempers ’ and thus em ­ ployed non-specific remedies such as sweating, bloodletting, and vomiting intended to evacuate any morbid matter. Para­ celsus ’ medicine regards disease not as a constitutional phen ­ omenon but as a parasitic invader; its cure demands the removal of a specific agent. Hence his therapy is not symptomatic but fundamental. This concern with the local and specific, ideas which flowed naturally from the exploration of correspondences and analo ­ gies, led Paracelsus to the isolation of virtues in concentrated extracts and chemical remedies. This new pharmacy is based on a scientific procedure and has less to do with the trial and error of Galenic herbalism and nothing whatsoever to do with the ancient formulae of qualities, grades, and humours. Para­ celsus is often called the father of homoeopathy. His chemical"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"32 ______________________ PARACELSUS _______________________ remedies are indeed based on the fine sympathies between the diseases and the arcana. This sympathy is opposed to the ancient principle of opposites in remedial action. Paracelsus denied that a ‘ cold ’ remedy can cure a ‘ hot ’ disease, unless this is due to the other properties of the remedies concerned. He claimed that cancer corresponded to arsenic in the macrocosm and asserted that arsenic itself would cure this arsenical condition. Similarly, stone (a hard morbid concretion in the kidney, etc.) can be cured by other stones such as crab ’ s claws, lapis lazuli, sponges, actites, and celenites. A scorpion ’ s venom can cure scorpion poison ­ ing. Paracelsus thought that the specificity of an arcanum lies in its ‘ anatomy ’ or structure, the work of Vulcana and the Archeus in the particular elemental matrix. Because the anat ­ omy of the remedy is identical with that of the disease agent, Paracelsus was a staunch advocate of the iso- or homoeopathic principle in medicine. Paracelsus ’ philosophical inspiration led him to expose the weakness and unreality of elemental and humoral doctrines. Many important proto-scientific ideas and modern medical the­ ories emerge in his work. His specific contributions to medi ­ cine are impressive and include: a humanitarian and ethical approach towards the patient, especially the mentally ill; a recognition of the healing power ot Nature and the value of antiseptic principles; progressive views on syphilis and a rejec ­ tion of guaiac and mercurial treatments; knowledge of the diuretic action ot mercury and its curative powers in dropsy; the connection between goitre, minerals, and drinking water in certain places; studies of spa waters and observations ot the beneficial digestive effects of certain acid waters (balneology); the description of the Miners ’ Disease as an occupational ill ­ ness in which he shows the greater toxical risks in metals than in salts and recounts a concrete aetiology with numerous symptoms. Notwithstanding, it is misleading to call Paracelsus the founder of any particular branch of medicine. These accurate and valuable insights arc embedded in an opus which already fills twenty volumes in the Sudhoff-Matthiessen and Goldam- mer editions. His works are chiefly concerned with his sys ­ tem of neo-Platonic correspondences and their illustration by"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THE PHILOSOPHY, MEDICINE, AND THEOLOGY __ 33 recourse to analogy, symbol, and myth. These correspondences are empirical details of a universal theory of matter based on spirit, energy and divine purpose. It is not appropriate to under ­ stand Paracelsus as a figure at the threshold of modern Western scientific thought. We should rather reflect on the perennial truths of his science of the symbol and their unexpected relevance to the profound problems of our scientific and tech ­ nological era. He was the founder of an alternative science and medicine. Alchemy plays a major part in the thought of Paracelsus. Medieval alchemists such as Arnald of Villanova, John de Rupescissa, and the followers of Ramon Lull had already prac ­ tised an art which was both operative and empirical in that it was based on visible results rather than logic. Their alchemy was primarily concerned with the volatile substances, their pro ­ tection from evaporation and retention in solid bodies. All motion, activity and form were held to depend upon volatile or spiritual (airy or fiery) principles, which were virtues within objects. Substances were produced in alchemy by a process comparable to generation in Nature. By imitating the natural generation of diverse substances and acting on the humours of metals, alchemy was supposed to be able to convert base metals into perfect metals. Alchemists believed that they could ‘ cure ’ and convert base metals into gold by a process of remov ­ ing their impurities. These ideas seem very similar to those of Paracelsus. He too sought the volatile, the invisible and the vir ­ tues inside objects. He compared alchemy to medicine and the baseness of metals to disease. Paracelsus also followed the medieval alchemists in his rejec­ tion of gold-making as the ultimate goal of alchemy. He mainly regarded alchemy as important for the curing of disease and the prolongation of life. Alchemy was another means of per ­ fecting what Nature had left in an imperfect state. Paracelsus based his alchemy on the parallels between the macrocosm and the microcosm and the various possible transformations of the three principles of constitution, the fluid (Mercury), the solid (Salt), and the combustible (Sulphur). Paracelsus quoted Hermes Trismegistus, who stated that all seven metals, ‘ the tinctures ’ (generating principles), and the Philosopher ’ s Stone all derive"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"34 ______________________ PARACELSUS _______________________ from three substances, namely spirit, soul, and body. Paracelsus claimed that these were identical to his three principles of con ­ stitution: Mercury (spirit). Sulphur (soul), and Salt (body). Since Mercury represented the spirit, this metal was as important as gold, the solar metal. However, Paracelsian alchemy treated Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury as principles rather than as the elements of medieval alchemy. Also, Paracelsus used chemical reactions to explain the processes of human physiology; medieval alchemy attempted the converse. Paracelsus developed upon medieval alchemy by focusing upon its naturalistic and medical implications. In his philosophy and medicine Paracelsus replaced the medieval, hierarchical conception of God, man, and Nature with a more reciprocal and direct relationship between God and man through His presence in man and Nature. Paracelsus regarded human spirit and talent as direct emanations of God. Accord ­ ing to this essentially neo-Platonist notion, the spirit is a divine spark of the Godhead which inheres in man. Paracelsus regarded man as the crown of creation and believed in his free will and power to the extent that he could even act upon the stars. Since man had such tremendous potential, Paracelsus could not coun ­ tenance the subjection of man within an arbitrary social or polit ­ ical structure. He believed that men should be free to develop their gifts to the utmost for communal benefit, rather than being harnessed to the political interests of a master or lord. His motto ‘ that man no other man shall own who to himself belongs alone ’ contains an explicit social and political philosophy based upon the notion of the divinely inspired individual. As a Reformation figure, Paracelsus has often been compared to Luther. They share many traits, including coarse and boister ­ ous language, the use of vernacular German rather than Latin as a popular means of communication, the wholesale rejection of academic predecessors, and theatrical acts intended to appeal to students and common folk such as the burning of books and public instruction. However, Paracelsus was a pacifist and a staunch advocate of the ordinary people. He sided with the rebellious peasants who risked persecution and death in their struggles against the feudal lords at Salzburg in 1525. His medi­ cine was inspired by charitable motives and involved risks to"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"THE PHILOSOPHY, MEDICINE, AND THEOLOGY __ 35 his own health and life. He expressed his Christianity through acts of self-denial and practical works. He was always prepared to take the part of the poor and the downtrodden against the rich, mighty, and privileged. His conviction in the absolute value of each individual ’ s link with God was paramount in his social and political attitude. Whilst inspired by similar motives, Luther ultimately upheld the authority ot the secular princes of Germany against the revolting peasants. In his religious ideas Paracelsus remained committed to the ­ ological individualism and popular pantheism. The latter der ­ ived from the philosophy of Salomon Ibn Gabirol (1020-70), also known as Avicebron, who described prime matter as a unity of spirit and body in all things inferior to God. David of Dinant (d. 1209) adapted Avicebron ’ s doctrine of prime mat ­ ter to denote the Godhead which originates, sustains, and exists in all things. The emanationist implications of David ’ s popu ­ lar preaching reached and influenced many mystical anarchist and millcnarian movements in the late Middle Ages, includ ­ ing the Waldensians, the Brethren of the Free Spirit, the Amau- rians, the Beghards and the Beguines, the Bohemian Adamites, and the Anabaptists. Paracelsus revived the idea of ‘ prime mat ­ ter ’ in his concept of Iliaster and regarded this reservoir of poten ­ tial matter-energy as necessary for the nourishment, growth, and preservation of all natural things. Iliaster is also a spiritual vital force in man and thus justifies his free and independent status in a moral and political context. It is therefore possible to see Paracelsus as an heir of the same popular pantheism which inspired sectarian revolutionaries. Paracelsus ’ social and political views were radical, and he is known to have had frequent contact with scattered Anabap ­ tist groups in the 1520s and 1530s. He agreed with the diverse social reformers of his time in their critique of the contemporary powers of Church and State. But it would be wrong to iden ­ tify him with secular revolutionary thought. His approach was one of balance. Paracelsus was opposed to dogma. He recog ­ nized private property within limits, upheld the rights of the individual, and regarded the family as the fundamental unit of society. He also preserved the medieval idea of Christian com ­ munity life, so that his ‘ communism ’ was a matter of natural"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"36 ______________________ PARACELSUS _______________________ inspiration rather than systematic, rule-bound, and class ­ conscious. He interpreted property and poverty as religious and theological states of being rather than as economic privilege and misfortune. He exposed the antisocial and antihuman nature of commercial and professional vested interests. But he was also a conservative and entrusted his proposed plan of communaliz- ing the land and the means of production to the Emperor and his administration. Paracelsus was bold and uncompromising in his views and proposed reforms. Both the man and his works possess an epic quality, so that it is not surprising that his ideas and influence should have long survived his own lifetime. Indeed, during his life only a few of his writings were published. From the early 1550s onwards more and more Paracelsian texts came to light. The publication of the numerous books, tracts, and papers dur ­ ing the period up to 1570 reflects the activity of the early Paracelsists, including Adam of Bodenstein, Michael Toxites, Gerhard Dorn, Theodor and Arnold Birckmann. The collected editions were first published by Johannes Huser ofWaldkirch (Baden) in 1589-91, 1603, and 1605. At the beginning of the seventeenth century Paracelsus gave an important impetus to the Rosicrucian movement and strongly influenced Michael Maier (1568-1622) and the famous Christian mystic Jakob Bochme. Other Continental and English Paracelsists included Oswald Croll, John Dee, Francis Anthony, and Robert Fludd. This period represents the peak of his immediate influence in certain medical circles; by the second half of the century his importance was eclipsed by the primacy of rational empiricism in science and medicine. During the zenith of rationalism in the eighteenth century Paracelsus was remembered only to be dismissed as a mystical obscurantist whose theories represented an early phase in the development of modern medicine. But Paracelsus ’ ideas were rediscovered by Goethe, Novalis, Schelling, and other Romantic thinkers at the close of the eighteenth century. His name and works were popularized by H.P. Blavatsky, Franz Hartmann, and Rudolf Steiner in the modern occult revival at the end of the nineteenth century.

DROPSY When the body begins to swell abnormally from the feet upwards to the hips, genitals, and heart as far as the eyebrows, and it continues to fill up until the spirit of life drowns in the body, as if man were subject to an excessive efflux causing his body to grow folds, there is a tightening around the heart, coughing, shortness of breath. These things are the disease called dropsy. Finally, the urine is reddish in colour, the skin splits open and the fluid runs out, and there is thirstiness. In some people, the disease is quick, in others slow, depending on the impression of the heavens. Death occurs likewise. In order to understand the causes of the disease one must know these things, the virtue of the heavens, terrestrial nature, and the microcosm — the heavens as a twofold craftsman, visi ­ ble and invisible; terrestrial nature which is nothing without the heavens; and the microcosm as the patient. The heavens and the earth are twofold, but man is a unity. Take the follow ­ ing example: the earth is nothing without the impression of the heavens. The earth greens, brings forth fruit, and lives through the heavens; that is to say, the heavens are its life, dis ­ ease, and health. Now there are two earths: terrestrial nature and man, for whom it was created. The man is the invisible earth and yet he has the nature of the earth. The heavens are"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"twofold: the visible heavens work their (visible) impressions on the earth such as rain, dew, frost, and such like, and from these impressions the earth draws life. There is also a hidden heaven which works upon both man and the earth. Since man is an invisible earth, he too requires benefit, and moreover in ­ visible benefit. The influences arc like rain, dew, etc., and arc impressions comparable to their visible counterparts. Just as the rain can ruin the soil, making it too moist, and drowning it, so man can be saturated. This is dropsy. As the impression saturates the microcosm, so the water sinks by its own weight through the passages of the body, filling them and all other cavities and muscles. Depending on the strength of the impres ­ sion, the water rises up to the knees, the hips, the genitals, the passages of the stomach, on and on upwards. Because the spirit of life resides in the centre of man, it is in danger of drowning and it cannot flee. Thus is resists and drives the water further on into the upper points of the heart, but the spirit is weaken ­ ing. In effecting the cure consider three things: the heavens, the earth, and the microcosm. Only the element fire can with ­ stand the heavens ’ water: that is the sulphur of metals. This sulphur can resist the influences by drying out, for it is the sun which drives away the rain and evaporates it. When the earth is saturated, the superfluity of water must be removed to pre ­ vent the earth from rotting. Because rotting is a dissolution which cannot be made whole again, only the element of dry ­ ness, which is also a fire, can help here. That is the crocus of metals and there is nothing drier.

Thus the earth is obliged to the heavens for everything being in its full and proper measure. Now if the heavens were un ­ favourable and withdrew this nourishment, things would begin to dry up and wither like hay and die through this aridity. The body of man comes from the earth and thus he too is subject to this impression. If the heavens are favourable to him, he will have his proper weight; but if they are not, his weight will decline and he will lose up to half or all of his blood, flesh, or internal organs. The man dries out more each day until he is a hard body or a piece of wood which has lost all its sap. Man is so created than the impressions rather than food and drink make him fat or thin. Wherever the impression is totally withdrawn, nothing can green; the food and drink dry up, dry out. The body of man resembles the earth: it is fruitful in sum ­ mer and unfruitful in winter. Thus, whatever summer has given, winter consumes, and the following summer must make good what has been lost. Winter also befalls man and the former growth is consumed. If another summer did not come, all men would dry out. But as soon as winter is past, the next summer is there, and whatever has been consumed by the winter, grows green again in the summer. This comes about through the virtue of the heavens, and man as the microcosm must bear with it . . . Every impression of the heavens has an invisible effect on men. One should understand the brain, the heart, and every other organ as countries and regions, which require so much rain unless they are to dry out. The four external limbs, arms and legs, can dry out and so can the internal organs. Thus there are consumptions of the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, flesh, blood vessels, synovial fluid, joints, nerves, etc., or a general consumption of the whole body. There is a sun in the body which dries and removes moisture. If no rain comes, the sun will dry the body right out and cause consumption.

In effecting the cure, one must consider whether the microcosmic sun is giving enough moisture to replace what it is consuming. Now one cannot compel the heavens to do this, for they are not subject to the desires and appetites of man. However, there is an art of making another heaven in the case of human disease. This is just as powerful as the heavens above in the hands of the physician. Just as the grass grows to cover whole fields, we must sprinkle some water so that it may grow like the grass. This is the arcanum that gives rain and dew in the microcosm and takes away the con ­ sumption.

The stars have a force and efficiency that has power over our body, so that it must always be ready to serve them. This virtue of the stars is called ens astrorum , and it is the first ens to which we arc subjected. The second power that governs us and that inflicts diseases upon us is ens veneni, the influence of poison. Even if the stars are sound and have done no injury to the subtle body in us, this ens can destroy us; therein we are subject to it and cannot defend outsclves against it. The third ens is a power that injures and weakens our body even when the two other influences are beneficient; it is called ens naturale , the natural constitution. If it goes astray or disintegrates, our body becomes sick. From this many other diseases, indeed all diseases, can arise, even if the other entia are sound. The fourth ens , the ens spiritual — the spiritual entity — can destroy our bodies and bring various diseases upon us. And even if all four entia are propi ­ tious to us and are sound, yet the fifth ens , the ens Dei , can make our bodies sick. Therefore none of the entia deserves as much attention as this last one; for by it one can recognize the nature of all other diseases . . .

They are as useful to us and we need them as much as we need warmth and cold, food and drink and air: but further they are not in us nor we in them. Thus has the Creator designed. Who knows what there is in the firmament which can serve us? For neither the clarity of the Sun, nor the arts of Mercury, nor the beauty of Venus helps us; but the sun ­ shine helps us, for it makes the summer when the fruit ripens and those things that nourish us grow. But observe, if a child, which has been born under the luckiest planets and stars, and under those richest in good gifts, has in its own character those qualities that run counter to those gifts, who is to blame for it? It is the fault of the blood, which comes by generation. Not the stars, but the blood brings that about.

But the air is held in the firmament, and if it were not in the firmament, the firmament would melt away, and this we call the Mysterium. And observe well that this Mysterium con ­ tains all created things in heaven and earth and all the elements live in it and by it ... To explain what this Mysterium is, note first an illustration. A room shut up and locked has an odour which is not its own, but which comes from whomsoever has been inside. Therefore, whoever goes inside must be sensible of the odour, which is not generated by the air but comes from him who has been in the room. Now understand that we speak of the air in order that we may explain the ens astrorum. You allege that the air comes from the movement of the firmament: that we do not stand still, but that the wind proves itself to be meteoric. The air comes from the Most High and was before all created things, the first of all: after which the others were created. The firmament exists by the air as well as all other created things: therefore the air does not come from the fir ­ mament. For the firmament is maintained by the air, as man is; and if the firmament stood still, there would still be the air. If the world were to dissolve when the firmament stood still, it would be because the firmament had no air and because the air had melted away, and then all mankind and all the elements must pass away, for all are maintained by the air: that is Mys ­ terium magnum. This air may become poisoned and changed and men breathe it in, and since man ’ s life dwells in it, so must his body, which seizes on what is in Mysterium magnum and taints itself therewith.

I. i. 182-4 48 ___________________PARACELSUS ____________________ 2.5 But that is how you should understand the ens astrorum. The stars have their own nature and properties just as men have upon the earth. They change within themselves: one sometimes bet ­ ter, sometimes worse, sometimes sweeter, sometimes sourer, and so on. When they are good in themselves no evil comes irom them; but infection proceeds from them when they are evil. Now observe that the stars surround the whole world just as a shell does an egg: the air comes through the shell and goes straight to the earth. Then observe that those stars which are poisonous taint the air with their poison, so that where the poisoned air comes, at that place maladies break out accord ­ ing to the property of the star: the whole air of the world is not poisoned, only a part of it according to the property of the star. It is the same too with the beneficent properties of the stars: that too is ens astrale : that is the vapour, exhalation, exudation ot the stars mingled with the air. For thence came cold, warmth, drought, moisture, and such like according to their properties. Observe that the stars themselves do not act: they only infect through their exhalations that part of the Mys­ terium by which we are poisoned and enfeebled. And in this matter the ens astrale alters our body for good or evil. A man whose blood is hostile to such exhalations becomes ill; but one whose nature is not hostile is not hurt. He too who is finely fortified against such evils suffers nothing, because he over ­ comes the poison by the vitality of his blood, or by medicine which combats the evil vapours from above. Observe then that all created things are opposed to men, and men are opposed to them: all may hurt men and yet men can do nothing to them.

But this cold comes not from the Mysterium , but from the heavenly bodies whose property it is. The heat of the sun makes the water too warm and the fish die on this account also. Cer ­ tain heavenly bodies affect these two things, and others make the Mysterium acid, bitter, sweet, sharp, arsenical, and so on, a hundred various flavours. Every great change in the Mysterium changes the body, and so note how the stars contaminate the Mysterium , so that we fall ill and die of natural exhalations. No doctor need wonder at this, for there is as much poison in the stars as on the earth. And he must remember that there is no disease without a poison. For poison is the beginning of every disease and through the poison all diseases, whether in the body or occasioned by wounds, become disclosed. You will discover if you recognize this, that more than fifty diseases, and fifty more besides not one of which is like another, are all due to arsenic: still more are due to salt, still more to mercury, still more to red arsenic and sulphur. We point this out to you to make you realize that you may seek in vain for the special cause of one particular illness, so long as one substance gives rise to so many: find out the substance and you will then find out the special cause. And hold fast to the rule that you must know the substance which has caused the malady rather than the apparent cause, as practice will prove.

That you may fully understand this we will show you how maladies arc divided.

You know that our bodies require a constitution, by means of which they are maintained and nourished, and where this is absent, there is no life . . . There is no poison in the body, but there is poison in what we take as nourishment. The body is perfectly created, but food is not. Other animals and fruits are our food, but they are also a poison to us. They are not poisonous in themselves, they are perfectly created as we are. But they are poisonous to us as food — that which is poisonous to us is not poisonous to them.

The ox eats grass, man cats the ox. The peacock eats snakes and lizards, animals complete in them ­ selves, but not good for food except for the peacock . . .

Pig excrement is eaten by no animal because there is no cleverer alchemist to extract the nourishment than the alchemist of the pig . . . The alchemist takes the good and changes it into a tincture which he sends through the body to become blood and flesh. This alchemist dwells in the stomach, where he cooks and works. The man eats a piece of meat, in which is both bad and good. When the meat reaches"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"the stomach, there is the alchemist who divides it. What does not belong to health he casts away to a special place, and sends the good wherever it is needed.

That is to say, there is an essen ­ tia and a venenum in everything: the essentia supports him, the uenenum causes him illness . . . For sometimes the alchemist does his work imperfectly and does not divide the bad from the good thoroughly, and so decay arises in the mixed good and bad and there is indigestion. All maladies from the etts veneni arise from defective digestion. But where the digestion is dis ­ turbed, the alchemist is not in full possession of his instruments and corruption follows, and that is the mother of all such mala­ dies, for it poisons the body . . . Pure water can be tinged to any colour and the body is like that water and takes the colour ot decay, and there is no colour of decay which has not its ori ­ gin in poison. I. i. 195-6 2.11 Ens naturale is this: in astronomy you know the influence, the firmament, and all the heavenly bodies, and how to explain the stars, planets, and the nature of the heavens down to the smallest detail; there is an identical constellation and firmament in man. We should not mind calling man the microcosm, but you should understand this correctly. Just as the heavens with their firma ­ ment and constellations are free and independent, so man is constituted completely independently without any linkage. Thus there are two creations: one in heaven and earth, another in man . . . The earth brings forth all the fruits, in order that man can live on them. But all the fruits that grow in the world, grow in man. The earth is only there to bear fruits and nour ­ ish man. The body also has this function. All the nourishment"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"necessary for the limbs grows out of the body itself, and such growth is similar to the fruits of the earth. But you should understand that the body nourishes only four limbs; the others are planets and require no nourishment. For the body is twofold: heavenly and terrestrial. Man has two natures within him: the self-nourishing and that requiring nourishment. There is a part of the body which requires no external nourishment, that is the heaven in the body. But the corpus which resembles the earth gives of itself to nourish the four limbs. But man also has a connection, in that he must take nourishment from outside: this nourishment serves only the corpus, as manure does a field. It introduces no fruit, nor does it increase his seed, but simply maintains his substance and makes him lustful. That is how nourishment is useful to man. I. i. 202-4 52 ___________________ PARACELSUS ____________________ 2.12 There are seven organs in the body which require no nourish ­ ment but are self-sufficient like the seven planets which nour ­ ish themselves, taking nothing from each other, nor from the stars. Jupiter is such a planet, which needs no manure for the maintenance of its body, for it received adequate provision at its creation. And likewise the liver requires no manure . . . And just as Jupiter and the liver are to be understood, so the brain is the Moon, the heart the Sun, the spleen Saturn, the lungs Mercury, and the kidneys Venus. In the same way that the heavens have their motions, so you must understand the natural movement in the body. If you do not understand this, you can ­ not induce a crisis in the natural diseases caused by the ens naturale. I. i. 205 2.13 When a child is born, his firmament and the seven autonomous organs like the planets are simultaneously brought into being . . . At the time of birth this firmament of the child acquires predestination — that is, how long the ens naturale will run for. Take the example of an hourglass which one sets up and allows"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"to run. As soon as it begins, you know the time it will end. Nature also knows how long the ens naturale will run. And throughout its duration the ens naturae and creati will cause all the circuits of the bodily planets to be completed in the period between creation and the predestined end. If a child is predes ­ tined to live but ten hours, its bodily planets will complete all their circuits, just as they would if it had lived for a hundred years. The bodily planets of a centenarian, on the other hand, perform exactly the same number of circuits as those of a child which survives an hour, only at a slower rate. I. i. 206 ___ VOLUMEN MEDICINAE PARAMIRUM (c. 1520)____ 53 2.14 Thus it is wrong to correlate the crises by which the body may cure its disease arising from the ens naturale with the stars and their motions. What disease the body contracts by its ens naturale, the body purges by crises according to its own circuits and not those of heaven. According to the ens naturale Saturn has noth ­ ing to do with the spleen, nor the spleen anything to do with Saturn. One should count from birth until the predestined end and leave the heavens to do their own business. If someone knew the predestination of the heavens, he would know the predestination of man. But only God knows the predestina ­ tion, that is, the end. But note that the climaxes, conjunctions, oppositions, and such like do not occur in a material sense, but spiritually, in the general type of organization rather than in bodily changes. For the speeds of the bodily circuits do not admit of any increase or decrease of substance . . . Astronom ­ ical time is long, human rhythms are short. I. i. 207-8 2.15 Now that we have discussed the motion of the stars and the elements of the physical body, we will describe the four humours: choleric, sanguine, melancholic, and phlegmatic. However, we will dismiss the traditional teaching that these derive from the stars or the elements. Thus, there are in the body, as in the earth, four flavours: sour, sweet, bitter, salty."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"These four flavours inhere in everything, but they can only be established in man. The choler originates in bitterness and everything which is bitter, and is hot and dry. Melancholy is sourness, for everything which is sour is cold and dry. Phlegm comes from sweetness, for what is sweet is cold and moist. San ­ guine is from salt; whatever is salty is sanguine, hot and moist. These are the four humours to be found in the body. When salt predominates in the individual, he is sanguine; when the bitter predominates, he is choleric; the sour, melancholic; the sweet, phlegmatic. There are four humours, but only one predominates . . . With regard to these observations about the motion of the body, there are four bodily circuits: the heavenly, the elemental, the complexions, and the humours. All diseases deriving from the ens naturale may be divided into four types: the sidereal, namely chronic diseases; the elemental, that is acute or severe illness; the type of the complexions, that is morbi naturales, natural diseases; and the type of the humours, that is diseases of colour. I. i. 211-14 54 ___________________ PARACELSUS ____________________ 2.16 There are two kinds of disease, one material affecting the body, the other immaterial in the spirit. The latter cannot be physi ­ cally grasped and is invisible, but it can suffer from all diseases just as the body can.

It is possible that two spirits may become angry with each other and one hurts the other.

I. i. 217 ___ VOLUMEN MEDICINAE PARAMIRUM (c. 1520)____ 55 2.18 There are two ways in which the spirit can cause disease in the body. Firstly, when the spirits injure each other, without any will or thought on the part of man; in the second case, one should note that it is possible to hurt another by the unified force of thought, feeling, and will. This determined and directed will is a mother of the spirit ... If I desire to hurt another with all my will, this will-power is a creature of my spirit and acts against the spirit of the one concerned. He will suffer phys ­ ically, and yet this pain does not come from the body but from the spirit. Likewise, there can be a fight between the two spirits and one will overpower the other and win. If my opponent succumbs, this is due to his spirit not being so ardently inflamed against me as is mine against him. I. i. 219-20 2.19 You know that if a wax image of another person is buried and weighted with stones, then that person will suffer pain in the places where the stones lie and will not recover until the image is unburdened. If a leg is broken in the image, then that per ­ son will also break his leg; the same applies to stabs, wounds, and other things. This is the power of necromancy ... it is a matter of the spirit of one person being injured by the spirit of another. The body does not receive the wounds, although it feels them and they become visible. The spirit is causing it. You should not therefore treat the body but the spirit, so that the body may recover . . . You should also know that many can be made ill through the power of will without the aid of figures, images, and that kind of medium.

However, just as diseases derive from Nature and the four entia, we should seek their treatment in religious faith and not in Nature, as the fifth book will show. Thus you should know that you should seek the whole basis of healing in the fifth book, where the true medicine is demonstrated. I. i. 225 2.21 All health and disease comes from God and not from man. The diseases of man must be divided into two groups: the natural and the purgatorial. The natural diseases come from the first, second, third, and fourth entia, the fifth is the chastisement. God gives us a punishment, an example or lesson made manifest in our diseases, in order that we may see that all our knowledge is nothing . . . But in order that we may learn the reason, God gives us medicine for our diseases, as well as health and ill ­ ness. One should note that all our diseases ought to be cured in their own time and not according to our desire and will. That is to say, no physician can know the period of our recov ­ ery, for God holds that in his hand. For every disease is a chastisement, therefore no physician can heal it, until this chastisement is ended by God. The physician should be one who works in the consciousness of predestined chastisement.

The physician can be as good or as artful as he may wish, but the hour of the end of the chastisement must first come.

First, in the case of insensible creatures like foliage and grass, stone and ore, and other things, the seeds for their procreation arc found mixed and embedded in the essence of their nature, and arc inseparable from it. Second, the sensible creatures like man and the beasts have no seeds which spring from their nature. But here we are exclusively concerned with man. Neither a man nor a woman possesses seeds for the pro ­ creation of their species; they arc without seeds and free in nature, while all the insensible creatures arc mothers and carry seeds. Man is free without the embedded seeds and does not procreate as other creatures. I. i. 252-3 3.2 God created all things, but man alone He placed in the light of Nature to be free and independent. Because of the eternal in man, God took away his seeds and his instinct. . . He created man and woman and gave neither seeds, in order that lust might not lead them out of the light of Nature. But in order that they could procreate He gave them free will to decide whether they wanted to or not and thus he planted the seed in their imagin ­ ation. Thus, if a man wants to procreate, this speculation creates"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"the desire, and the desire creates his seed . . . God placed the seed in the speculation and gave free will to the speculation, to decide whether it had desire or not. But this desire does not arise from his nature but must be kindled by an object. That is to say, when a man sees a woman, she is the object, and it depends only on him whether he follows this object or not. For God endowed man with reason, in order that he might know what the desire means. But he himself must decide whether to yield to it or not, whether to follow his reason or not. God has placed the seed in man ’ s speculation, in which his reason lies, and in the object which kindles the specula ­ tion. But man must decide that he wants to, otherwise there is no seed in him. It is the same with woman. When she sees a man, he becomes her object and her speculation begins to dwell on him: she docs this by virtue of the reason which God has given to her. She has the power to feel desire or not. If she yields, she becomes rich in seeds; if not, she has neither seed nor desire. Thus God left the seed to the free decision of man, and the decision depends upon man ’ s will. He can do as he wishes. And since this free decision exists, it lies with both, with man and with woman. It will happen according the deci ­ sion of their will. Thus is the propagation of the seed. I. i. 254 __ DAS BUCH VON DER GEBARUNG (c. 1520) _____ 59 3.3 Both the man and the woman each have a half seed and the two together make a whole seed. And note how they come together. There is in the matrix [wombl an attractive force (like amber or a magnet) which draws the seeds unto itself. . . Once the will has determined, the matrix draws unto itself the seed ot the woman and the man from the humours of the heart, the liver, the spleen, the bone, the marrow, blood vessels, muscles, blood, and flesh, and all that is in the body. For every part of the body has its own particular seed. But when all these seeds come together, they are only one seed.

Then every seed lies as it should lie in the mother, which is called the microcosm. And all things which make a man are there, save life and the soul . . . But the seed of a single man is not able to give birth to a man. God wishes to make man out of two and not out of one; he wishes man to be composed of two and not of one alone. This may be con ­ sidered philosophically: if man were born of the seed of one individual, no other form of man would grow. His child would be just as he is, in the manner of a walnut tree, which is reborn of itself alone and therefore is like the one from which it is born. In all trees, the same always comes from the same, just as wal ­ nut trees all bear the same nuts and nothing changes. The same is true of man. If he had been born only of one individual, he would be like his father, and this father would be his father and mother in one. Thus there would be only one kind of peo ­ ple, and each would look like the other, and all would have the same seed and the same nature. But the mixing of the seeds of man and woman produces so many changes that no individual can be like the other. Each individual ’ s seed breaks the other ’ s seed and that is why no man is like another.

For the second seed breaks the first, and this always results in a change of nature. And the more different the two seeds are in their innate nature, the more will the breaking and dissimilarity be manifest. Thus the seed of the nose forms the"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"nose in the child, according to the mixed form of those of the parents.

During this period the seed develops into a child and in this manner: when conception has occurred, Nature orders the seeds as they should be, the seed of the head moves to the place of the head, the seed of the arms to its place, and every seed to where it should be. When everything is in its right place, the matrix stops and does nothing more. Thereupon fol ­ lows the action of material nature and makes the child grow, so that everything which has been thus arranged may develop into a body: what belongs to flesh develops into flesh, what belongs to bone into bone, what belongs to blood vessels into blood vessels, what belongs to the internal organs into inter ­ nal organs. And thus the seed ceases to be seed, and becomes flesh and blood as it should be in a man; then the material nature gives way to God ’ s grace and this gives the child life and every attribute of a living being — sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell — and then it has the virtue of growth. When life has thus been given according to God ’ s dispensation, the child grows in the womb, until all its members gain their full strength, and they are not deficient in nature and virtue, and are quite solid. Once this is so, the child is endowed with spirit, soul, reason, under ­ standing, and all that pertains to the soul . . . This all occurs in the specified number of weeks. Understand, therefore, how the received seed is at first formed and ordered, then trans ­ formed into flesh and blood, then is given size and strength, in order to be able to cope with life on earth; finally, how a maturation of spirit and soul attends this strength. The soul follows the spirit for this reason: it is possible that the grow ­ ing child may develop into a monster which is of no use to the soul. But if the growth is complete and healthy, then the"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"spirit comes as the herald of the soul, which soon follows. Thus the child grows in the union of spirit and body, until it can no longer do without the earth ’ s air and the maternal food. And then the birth follows.

For we were continually hedged in by calamities and bitter conditions, and were bound with terrible chains. Every days things became worse with us, as with others who were weighed in the same balance, whom also the ancients have not so far been able to help or to heal by means of their books. We do not in this place advance the different causes of this misfortune. This only we say, that many teachers by following the ancient methods have acquired for themselves much wealth, credit, and renown, though they did not deserve it, but got together such great resources by simple lies. From which consideration we have wished to elaborate and write this memorial work of ours, that we might arrive at a more com ­ plete and happier method of practice, since there are presented to us those mysteries of Nature which are too wonderful to be ever thoroughly investigated. Wherefore we have come to"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"consider how that art can be reconciled with the mysteries of Nature, in opposition to those who, so far, have not been able to arrive at the art at all. The strength of this mystery of Nature is hindered by the bodily structure, just as if one were bound in a prison with chains and fetters. From this the mind is free. For in its opera ­ tion this mystery is like fire in green wood, which seeks to burn, but cannot on account of the moisture. Since, then, hindrance arises from this source, one had to see how to get free from it. For such freedom being secured, this art of separation can only be compared to the art of the apothe ­ caries, as light is compared to darkness. And this we say not in mere arrogance, but on account of the great frauds prac ­ tised by apothecaries and physicians. Wherefore, not undeser ­ vedly, we call them darkness, or caves of robbers and impostors, since in them many persons are treated for gain by ignorant men; persons who, if they were not rich, would at once be pro ­ nounced healthy, since the practitioners know that there is no remedy or help for these people in their consultations. This, then, is worthy to be called an art, which teaches the mysteries of Nature; which, by means of the quintessence, can cure a contraction and bring about health in the space of tour days, whereas otherwise death would be the result. A wound, too, can be healed in twenty-four hours, which would scarcely yield to bodily treatment in as many days. Let us, therefore, readily approach by experiment this separation of the myster ­ ies of Nature from the hindrances of the body. First, then, we have to consider what is of all things most useful to man and most excellent. It is to learn the mysteries of Nature, by which we can discover what God is and what man is, and what avails a knowledge of heavenly eternity and earthly weakness. Hence arises a knowledge of theology, of justice, of truth, since the mysteries of Nature are the only true life of man, and those things are to be imitated which can be known and obtained from God as the Eternal Good. For although many things arc gained in medicine, and many more in the mysteries of Nature, nevertheless after this life the Eter ­ nal Mystery remains, and what it is we have no foundation tor asserting, save that which has been revealed to us by Christ. 64 ___________________ PARACELSUS ____________________"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"________ NEUN BUCHER ARCHIDOXIS (1526) ________ 65 And hence arises the ignorant stupidity of theologians, who try to interpret the mysteries of God, whereof they know not the least jot; and what it is not possible for man to formulate, namely, the will of Him who gave the mystery. But that word of His they twist to their own pride and avarice; from whence arise misleading statements, which every day increase more and more. Hence it comes that we lightly value, nay, think noth ­ ing at all of that reason which is not evidently founded on the mysteries. In like manner the jurists have sanctioned laws according to their own opinions, which shall secure themselves against loss, though the safety of the State be imperilled. Seeing, then, that in these faculties so many practices have come into vogue which are contrary to equity, let us dismiss the same to their proper time. Nor do we care much for the vain talk of those who say more about God than He has rev ­ ealed to them, and pretend to understand Him so thoroughly as if they had been in his counsels; in the meantime abusing us and depreciating the mysteries of Nature and of philosophy, about all of which they arc utterly ignorant. The dishonest cry of these men is their principal knowledge, whereby they give themselves out to be those on whom our faith depends, and without whom heaven and earth would perish. O consummate madness and imposture on the part of human creatures, in place whereof it would be more just that they should esteem themselves to be nought but unprofitable ser­ vants! Yet we, by custom imitating them, easily learn, together with them, to bend the word of our Teacher and Creator to our own pride. But since this word is not exactly known to us, can only be apprehended by faith, and is founded on no human reason, however specious, let us rather cast off this yoke, and investigate the mysteries of Nature, the end whereof approves the foundation of truth; and let us not only inves­ tigate these, but also the mysteries which teach us to fulfil the highest charity. And that is the treasure of the chief good which in this writing of our Archidoxies we understand in a material way. From the aforesaid foundation we have drawn our medicine by experiment, w'herein it is made clear to the eye that things are so. Then, coming to its practice, we divide this our book"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"of Archidoxies into ten, as a sort of aid to the memory, so that we may not forget these matters, and at the same time may speak of them so far openly that we may be understood by our disciples, but not by the common people, for whom we do not wish these matters to be made too clear. We do not care to open our mind and thoughts and heart to those deaf ears, just as we do not wish to disclose them to impious men; but we shall endeavour to shut off our secrets from them by a strong wall and a key. And if by chance this our labour shall not be sufficiently safeguarded from those idiots who are enemies of all true arts, we shall forbear writing the tenth book, concern ­ ing the uses of those which precede it, so that we may not give the children ’ s meat to the dogs. Nevertheless, the other nine will be sufficiently understood by our own disciples. And, to speak more plainly of these matters, it must be known that in this treatise on the microcosm are proved and demon ­ strated all those points which it contains, which also embrace medicine, as well as those matters which arc interconnected therewith. The subject of the microcosm is bound up with medicine and ruled by it, following it none otherwise than a bridled horse follows him who leads it, or a mad dog bound with chains. In this way I understand that medicine attracts Nature and everything that has life. Herein three things meet us, which show by what forces they are filled and produced. Firstly, in what way the five senses are assisted by the myster ­ ies of Nature, though those senses do not proceed from Nature, nor spring naturally as a herb from its seed, since there is no material which produces them. Secondly, the mobility of the body is to be considered: whence it proceeds, by what power it is moved and exercised, and in what manner it is ministered to. Thirdly, there must be a knowledge of all the forces in the body, and what forces apply to each member, and are trans ­ muted according to the same nature as the particular limb, when originally they are identical in Nature. First, then, we will speak of these senses: sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. The following example teaches us. The eyes have a material substance, of which they arc composed, as it is handed down in the composition of the body. So of the other senses. But vision itself does not proceed from the 66 ___________________ PARACELSUS ____________________"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"_______ NEUN BUCHER ARCHIDOXIS (1526) ________ 67 same source as the eye; nor the hearing from sound, or from the same source as the ears; nor touch from flesh, nor taste from the tongue, nor smell from the nostrils, any more than reason proceeds from the brain; but these are the bodily instruments, or rather the envelopes in which the senses are born. For it must not be understood that these senses depend solely on the favour of God, in the sense that they do not belong to the nature of man, but are infused solely by the grace of God above and beyond all Nature, to the end that, if one were born blind, the mighty works of God might be made known to us. We must not think so in this case. For the above-mentioned senses have each their own body, imperceptible, impalpable, just as the root of the body, on the other hand, exists in a tangible form. For man is made up of two portions, that is to say, of a material and a spiritual body. Matter gives the body, the blood, the flesh; but spirit gives hearing, sight, feeling, touch, and taste. When, therefore, a man is born deaf, this happens from a defect of the domicile in which hearing should be quartered. For the spiritual body docs not complete its work in a situation which is badly disposed. Herein, then, are recognized the mighty things of God, that there are two bodies, an eternal and a corporeal, enclosed in one, as is made clear in Das Buck von der Gebarutig (Reading 3). Medicine acts upon the house by purging it, so that the spiritual body may be able to perfect its actions therein, like civet in a pure and uncontaminated casket. Coming next to the power of motion in the body, let us enquire whence it is produced and has its origin, that is, how the body unites itself to the medicine so that the faculty of motion is increased. The matter is thus to be understood. Every ­ thing that lives has its own motion from Nature. This is suffi ­ ciently proved of itself so far as natural motion is concerned. But the motion of which we think may be described as that which springs from the will, as, for example, in lifting the arm one may ask how this is done, when I do not see any instru ­ ment by which I influence it; but that takes place which I desire to take place. So one must judge with leaping, walking, run ­ ning, and other matters which occur in opposition to, or out ­ side of, natural motion. They have their origin in this, that"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"intention, a powerful mistress, exists above my notions in the following manner. The intention or imagination kindles the vegetative faculty as the fire kindles wood — as we describe more particularly in our treatise De virtute imaginative!. Nowhere is it more powerful to fulfil its operations than in its own body where it exists and lives. So, in every body, nothing is more easily kindled than the vegetative soul, because it runs and walks by itself and is disposed for this very purpose. For, even as a hidden or buried fire blazes forth so soon as it is exposed and catches the air, so my mind is intent upon seeing something. I cannot with my hands direct my eyes whither I will; but my imagination turns them whithersoever it is my pleasure to look. So, too, as to my motion must it be judged. If I desire to advance and arbitrarily propose this to myself, at once my body is directed to one or the other place fixed on by myself. And the more this is impressed on me by my imagination and thought, the more quickly I run. In this way, Imagination is the motive- power of my running. None otherwise does medicine purify those bodies in which there is a spiritual element, whence it happens that their motion is more easily perfected. Thirdly, it must be understood that in the body a distribu ­ tion is made over all the members of everything which is presented to it, either without or within. In this distribution a change takes place by which things are modified, so that one part subserves the constitution of the heart, another accom ­ modates itself to the nature of the brain; and of the rest in like manner. For the body attracts to itself in two ways, from within and from without. Within, it attracts whatever is taken through the mouth. Externally, it attracts air, earth, water, and fire. Thus, then, the subject is to be arranged and defined. Those matters which are received from within need not be described. They arc known by the foundation of our nature, what they are which are distributed, and we shall speak subsequently as to their divi ­ sion. But, externally, one must understand whatever is neces­ sary to itself the body attracts from the four elements. Unless this were done the internal nutriment would not suffice to sus ­ tain the life of man. For instance, moisture, not existing con ­ stitutionally in the body, is extracted by the body itself from water, whence it happens that if one stands or sits in water, 68 ___________________ PARACELSUS ____________________"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"_______ NEUN BUCHER ARCHIDOXIS (1526) ________ 69 it is not necessary that he satisfies his thirst from without. It does not, indeed, take place in the same way that heat is extin ­ guished by water, like fire; but the internal heat attracts to itself the moisture from without, and imbibes it just as though it were from within. Hence it happens that in the Alps cattle are able to remain the whole summer without drinking; the air is drink for them, or supplies its place: and the same should be judged with regard to man. The nature of man, too, may be sustained in the absence of food, if the feet are planted in the earth. Thus we have seen a man who lived six months without food and was sustained only by this method: he wore a clod of earth on his stomach, and, when it got dry, took a new and fresh one. He declared that during the whole of that time he never felt hungry. The cause of this we show in the treatise The Appetite of Nature. So, in the matter of medicine, we have seen a man sustain himself for many years by the quintessence of gold, taking each day scarcely half a scruple of it. In the same way, there have been many others who for so long as twenty years ate noth ­ ing, as I remember to have seen in our times. This was by some attributed to the piety and goodness of the persons themselves, or even to God, which idea we would be the last to impugn or to criticize. But this, nevertheless, is an operation of Nature; insomuch that sorrow and mental despondency take away hun ­ ger and thirst to such an extent that the body can sustain itself for many years by its own power of attraction. So, then, food and drink arc not thus arranged that it is absolutely necessary we should eat bread or meats, or drink wine or water, but we are able to sustain our life on air and on clods of earth; and whatever is appointed for food, we should believe is so appointed that we should taste and try it, as we shall show more at length in The Monarchy of God. Let us, however, concede this point — that on account of our labours and such things, it can ­ not be that we do without temporal and bodily food, and that for many causes. Wherefore food was ordained for this pur ­ pose, just as medicine was against diseases. We will make a distinction of things entering into the body after the following fashion, that they arc distributed through every part of it none otherwise than as if ardent wine be poured"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"into water. The water acquires the odour of the wine because the wine is distributed through its whole volume; and, in the same way, when ink is poured into wine the whole of the wine is thereby blackened. So, too, in the human body, the vital moisture immediately diffuses whatever is received, and more quickly than in the examples we have cited. But under what form the substance received becomes trans ­ muted depends entirely on the nature of the members that receive it, just as if bread be conveyed into a man it becomes the flesh of a man, if into a fish the flesh of a fish, and so on. In the same way, it must be understood that the substances received are transmuted by the natural power of the members, and are appropriated according to the nature of the parts which take them up. A like judgement must be passed upon medi ­ cines, namely, that they are transmuted into members accord ­ ing to the properties of those members. For the limbs gain their own force and virtue from the substance of medicines peculiar to themselves, according to the good or bad dispersion of them, and according as the medicine itself was subtle or gross. This is the case with the quintessence; its transmutation will be stronger and more effectual. But if it be thick it remains the same, just as a picture acquires its tint, its beauty, or its defor ­ mity from its colours, and if these be more vivid it will be the same. Wherefore, in order that we may have experience of like matters to fall back upon in those things which happen to us, and that we may lay them up in our memory, so as to have them ready in case of need, we will write these nine books, keeping the tenth shut up in our own brain on account of the thankless idiots. Nevertheless, to our own disciples, these things shall be made sufficiently clear. And let no one wonder at the school of our learning. Though it be contrary to the courses and methods of the ancients, still it is firmly based on experience, which is mistress of all things, and by which all arts should be proved. 70 ___________________ PARACELSUS ____________________ I. lii. 93-101"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"5 DAS B UCH PARAGRANUM (1529-30) 5.1 They reproach me that my writings are not like theirs; that is the fault of their understanding, not my fault, for my writings are well rooted in experiment and evidence and will send forth their young shoots when the right May-time comes. They have good cause to complain of my writings, for no one cries out unless he is hurt; no one is hurt unless he is sensitive, unless he is transient and impermanent. They cry out because their art is fragile and mortal; what is not mortal does not cry out, thus they are mortal and they cry out against me. The art of medicine does not cry out against me, for it is immortal and set upon such an eternal foundation that heaven and earth shall be shattered before medicine perishes. So long as I am at peace with medicine, why should the outcry of a mortal physician upset me?

Their works would certainly not reveal them. Outwardly they are beautiful, inwardly they are squalid dunces. What instructed and experienced man desires a doctor who is only an outward show? None. Only the sim ­ pletons desire him. What, then, is the origin of that medicine which no instructed man desires, from which no Philosophy issues, in which no Astronomy can be noted, in which no Alchemy is practised, and in which there is no vestige of Vir ­ tue?

In this context, astral concordance is the power of remedies which it directs to the diseased organ]: 5.8 Medicine must be understood and classified internally.

The phy ­ sician should know how to bring about a conjunction between the astral Mars and the grown Mars (i.e. the herbal remedy). In this sense the remedy should be prepared in the star and should become a star, for the stars above make us ill and die, they make us healthy . . . The physician must therefore aban ­ don [the ancient Galenic way in the preparation of remedies based on] grades, complexions, humours, and qualities and must understand medicine in the light of the heavens, namely that there are stars both above and below. As a remedy cannot act without the heavens, it must be directed by them. Thus you must make a remedy volatile, that is to say, remove what is earthly in it, lor only then will the heavens direct it. What should act in the brain will be directed to it by the Moon; what on the spleen by Saturn; what belongs to the heart will be guided to it by the Sun, and to the kidneys by Venus, by Jupiter to the liver, by Mars to the gall-bladder . . .

These three form man and are man and he is them, receiving from them and in them all that is good and all that is evil for the physical body. So that the phy ­ sician must know these three and must understand their com ­ binations, their maintenance, and their analysis. For in these three lie all health and all sickness, whether whole or partial. In them therefore will be discovered the measure of health and the measure of disease: for the physician must not overlook the weight, number, and measure of disease. For according to these he can estimate the source whence it derives, and it is of great importance to understand this well before going fur ­ ther. Death is also due to these three, because if life be with ­ drawn from the primary substances in whose union life and man exist, man must die. From these primary substances there ­ fore proceed all causes, origins, and knowledge of disease, their symptoms, development, and specific properties, and all that is essential for a physician to know.

When the physician finds Nature open and unconcealed before him, then will the origin of health and sickness be unobscurcd. For since he is a physician by and from medicine and not without medicine, and since medicine is older than he, he is out of medicine and not medicine out of him. Let him search and learn from what has made him and not from himself. For the fire is in the teacher, not in the pupil. I. ix. 41-2 ____________ OPUS PARAMIRUM (1530-1) _____________ 77 6.3 There are two kinds of knowledge, that of experience and that of our own cleverness. The knowledge of expenence is twofold: one kind is the foundation and teacher of the physician; the other is his misleading and error. He receives the first from the fire when he plies the Vulcanic art in transmuting, forging, reducing, solving, perfecting with all the processing pertain ­ ing to such work. And it is by such experimenting that the three substances arc discovered, all that is contained in Nature, their kind, character, and properties. The other kind of know ­ ledge is but hearsay without experiment. It may prove right once but not invariably, and it does not do to build upon such a foundation. Error is built upon it, error glossed over with sophistries. . . For we cannot be taught medicine by hearsay or by reading, but by learning. Nature in the fire of experi ­ ment shall be our teacher. . . We can no longer believe in the four humours existing in man; it is but a matter of belief. But medicine does not belong to faith, but to the evidence of our eyes. Nothing but the sickness and health of the soul is a mat ­ ter of faith. All bodily medicine is a visible matter and requires no faith . . . Hence, the physician must be called to the profes ­ sion. Medicine grows out of the earth for him. The earth knows him, establishes and rejects him.

I. ix. 43-5 78 ___________________ PARACELSUS ____________________ 6.4 There are three substances which give every single thing its body. The names of these three things are Sulphur, Mercury, and Salt. These three are combined to make a body and noth ­ ing else is added save life and that which pertains to it. If you take an object in your hand, you have these three substances concealed within one body. A peasant can tell you that you are holding a piece of wood, but you also know that you have a compound of Sulphur, Mercury, and Salt. If you have a bone and can say whether it is mostly Sulphur, Mercury, or Salt, you know why it is diseased or what is the matter with it. The peasant can see the externals, but the physician ’ s task is to sec the inner and secret matter. In order to make these things visi ­ ble, Nature must be compelled to show itself. . . Take a piece of wood. It is a body. Now burn it. The flammable part is the Sulphur, the smoke is the Mercury, and the ash is the Salt. The peasant cannot understand the process of combustion, but the physician can with the eyes of medicine. I. ix. 45-6 6.5 What is the taste other than a need in the anatomy in which nothing is important except to reach its own like? It follows that as this gustus [taste] is distributed to every member in the body, each desires its own like, the sweet desires the sweet, the bitter desires the bitter, each in its degree and measure, as those held by the plants sweet, sour, and bitter. .Shall the liver seek medicine in gentian, agaric, or colocynth? No. Shall the gall­ bladder seek medicine in manna, honey, sugar, or the polyp ­ ody fern? No, for like seeks its like. Nor in the order of anat ­"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"omy shall cold be a cure for heat, nor heat for cold. It would be a wild disorder if we were to seek our cure in contraries. A child asks his father for bread and he does not give him a snake. God has created us and he gives us what we ask, not snakes. So it would be bad medicine to give bitters where sugar is required. The gall-bladder must have what it asks, and the heart too, and the liver. It is a fundamental pillar upon which the physician should rest to give to each part of the anatomy the special thing that accords with it. For the bread which the child eats has an anatomy similar to his own, and the child cats as it were his own body. Therefore each sickness in the anat ­ omy must have its own corresponding medicine. He who does not understand the anatomy finds it difficult to act if he be honest and simple; but it is worse with those whose honour is small and whom shame and crime do not trouble. They are the enemies of the light of Nature. . . What blind man asks for bread from God and receives poison? If you are experienced and grounded in anatomy you will not give stones instead of bread. For know that you are the father rather than the physi ­ cian of your patients: therefore feed them as a father docs his child. As a father must support his child according to his need and must give him the food which becomes himself, so must the physician care for his patients. I. ix. 63-4 ____________ OPUS PARAMIRUM (1530-1) _____________ 79 6.6 Christ who is the Truth has given us no false remedy but one that is compatible and arcane. For far be it from us to say that Christ knew not the simplicia of Nature. Therefore oil and wine must be competent, else there is no foundation in medicine. . . Let it be manifest to you that a grain of wheat yields no fruit unless it be cast into the ground and die there. Thus the wound is the earth, and the oil and wine the grain. You must guess what the fruit is. I. ix. 65-6 6.7 There are three anatomies which should be maintained in man:"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"first localis, which tells us form, propositions, substance of a man and all that pertains to him; the second shows the living Sulphur, the flowing Mercury, the sharp Salt in each organ; and the third instructs us what kind of anatomy death brings, that is mortis anatomia, and in what manner and likeness he comes. For the light of Nature shows that death comes in as many forms as there arc species from the elements; there are as many kinds of death as there are kinds of corruption. And just as each corruption gives birth to another, it requires anat ­ omy. It comes in many forms until one after another we all die and are consumed through corruption. But beyond all these anatomies, there is also a uniform science in the anatomy of medicine, and beyond them all stand heaven, earth, water, and air, and the heavens and all the stars have their part in the new anatomy. For Saturn must give his saturnum , Mars his martem , and until these are discovered, the art of medicine has not been found. For as the tree grows out of the seed, so must all that seems now invisible grow into new life, for it is there, and it must come to pass that it shall be visible. For the light of Nature is a light to make men see and it is neither dark nor dim. And it must come to pass that we shall use our eyes in that light to see those things that we require to see. They will not be otherwise than they arc now; but w r e must be otherwise able to see them. We must see in a different manner to the peasant. The light of Nature must kindle our eyes. I. ix. 68-9 80 ___________________PARACELSUS ____________________ 6.8 All our nourishment becomes ourselves; we eat ourselves into being. So also in medicine, with this difference, that the treat ­ ment must match the disease. In health all that is worn out is restored to each organ by and in itself. Do not be astonished at this: a tree which stands in the field would not be a tree, had it no nourishment. What is nourishment? It is not a mere feeding or stuffing, but the restoration of form. What is hun ­ ger? It is a precursor of future death in the waste of the organs. For the form is carved by God himself in the womb. This carv ­ ing abides in the form of each type, but it wastes and dies"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"without addition from without. He who does not eat does not grow, he who does not eat does not last. Therefore he who grows, grows by nourishment, and the shaper is with him to give form, and without it he cannot exist. Whence it follows that the nourishment of each carven type has the form within itself in which it grows and develops. Rain has the tree in itself, and so has the earth sap. Rain is the drink, earth sap the food, by which the tree grows. What is it that grows? What the tree absorbs from rain and earth sap becomes wood and bark. The shaper is in the seed, wood and bark arc in the earth sap and the rain. The craftsman in the seed can make wood out of these two things. And it is the same with plants; the seed is nothing but a beginning in which is the form and the craftsman, the type and property. If it is to germinate, the rain, dew, and earth sap must develop the plant, for in these arc the stalks, leaves, flowers, and so on. I. ix. 71-2 ___________ OPUS PARAMIRUM (1530-1)_____________ 81 6.9 There must therefore be an outward form in all nourishment lor growth, and if we do not receive it, we never grow but die in the neglected form. And if we are grown up, we must preserve our form, lest it waste away. For we have in us what resembles fire, which consumes our form. If we did not sup ­ ply and support the form of our body, it would die neglected. Therefore what we eat becomes ourselves so that we do not die through the decay of our form. In this way we eat our fingers, our body, blood, flesh, feet, brain, heart, and so on. For every bite we take contains in itself all our organs, all that is included in the whole man, all of which he is constituted . . . When summer is at hand, the trees become hungry because they want to put forth leaves, blossom, fruit. They have not got these within themselves, otherwise trees that were cut down would put forth leaves as well as those still standing. They stand in the earth whence they receive these things into their own form, where the craftsmen shapes them according to the kind of each; that is his contribution. Know therefore that in order"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"to preserve their form and type from being consumed, all liv­ ing things become hungry and thirsty. I. ix. 72-3 82 ___________________ PARACELSUS ___________________ 6.10 There are two men, visible and invisible. That which is visible is twofold, namely, like the body in this example. An image is carved out of wood, in which it could not be originally dis ­ cerned. This is the nourishment, which once in the body goes into all its organs. It docs not remain in one part, but is richly used. For the great Artist carves it, He who makes man, and distributes to the organs so as to make man. Now we know that we eat ourselves; every tree and every creature that lives, and we must now learn further what follows from this con ­ cerning medicine. We do not eat bone, blood vessels, ligaments, and seldom brain, heart, and entrails, nor fat; therefore bone does not make bone, nor brain brain, but every bite contains all these. Bread is blood, but who sees it? It is lat, who sees it? For the master-craftsman in the stomach is good. He can make iron out of brimstone; he is there daily and shapes the man according to his form. He can make diamonds out of salt, and gold out of mercury. He is more concerned with man than with things, so he labours at him in all that is necessary. Bring him the material, let him divide it and shape it as it should be, for he knows the measure, number, weight, proportion, length and all. Know then that every creature is twofold, one out of the seed, the other out of nourishment . . . He has death within himself, and through nourishment he must hold it at bay. I. ix. 73-4 6.11 The body is developed from Sulphur, that is, the whole body is one Sulphur, and that a subtle Sulphur which burns and des­ troys invisibly. Blood is one Sulphur, flesh is another, the major organs another, the marrow another, and so on; and this Sul­ phur is volatile. But the different bones are also Sulphur, only their Sulphur is fixed: in scientific analysis each Sulphur can be distinguished. Now the stiffening of the body comes from"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Salt: without the Salt no part of the body could be grasped. From Salt the diamond receives its hard texture, iron its hard ­ ness, lead its soft texture, alabaster its softness, and so on. All stiffening or coagulation comes from Salt. There is therefore one Salt in the bones, another in the blood, another in the flesh, another in the brain, and so on. For as many as there are Sul ­ phurs there are also Salts. The third substance of the body is Mercury, which is a fluid. All parts of the body have their own fluid: thus the blood has one, the flesh has another, the bones, the marrow, each has its own fluid, which is Mercury. So that Mercury has as many forms as Sulphur and Salt. But since man must have a complete form, its various parts must compact, stiffen, and have a fluid: the three form and unite one body. It is one body but of three substances. Sulphur burns, it is only a sulphur; Salt is an alkali, for it is fixed; Mercury is a vapour, for it does not burn but evaporates. Know then that all disso ­ lution arises from these three. I. ix. 82-3 ____________ OPUS PARAMIRUM (1530-1) _____________ 83 6.12 The three substances are in the four elements, or mothers of all things; for out of the elements proceed all things: from earth come plants, trees, and all their varieties; from water, metals, stones, and all minerals; from the air, dew and manna; from fire, thunder, rays of light, snow, and rain. And when the micro­ cosm is broken up, part becomes earth, and so wonderful that in a brief time it bears the fruits whose seed has been sown therein, and this the physician should know. Out of the broken body, too, comes the second element, water; and as water is the mother of the minerals, the alchemist can compound rubies out of it. And the dissolution also gives the third element, fire, from which hail can be drawn. And air too ascends from the rising spirit, just as dew forms inside a closed glass. Many have begun to treat of this generation of creation, but they have failed. There is another transmutation after these, and it yields every kind of Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury which the microcosmic world can demonstrate. This is very important, for it concerns man ’ s quest for health, his water of life, his Philosopher ’ s Stone,"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"his arcanum, his balsam, his golden drink, and the like. All these things are in the microcosm; just as they are in the outer world, they are in the inner world. I. ix. 91-2 84 ___________________ PARACELSUS ____________________ 6.13 Therefore man is his own physician; for as he helps Nature she gives him what he needs, and gives him his herbal garden according to the requirements of his anatomy. If we consider and observe all things funamentally we discover that in our ­ selves is our physician and in our own nature are all things that we need. Take our wounds: what is needed for the healing of wounds? Nothing except that the flesh should grow from within outwards, not from the outside inwards. Therefore the treatment of wounds is a defensive treatment, that no contin ­ gency from without may hinder our nature in its working. In this way our nature heals itself and levels and fills up itself, as surgery teaches the experienced surgeon. For the mutnia is the man himselt, the mumia is the balsam which heals the wound: mastic, gums, glaze will not give a morsel of flesh; but they can protect the working of Nature so as to assist it. I. ix. 92-3 6.14 Since man derives from the limbus and the limbus is the whole world, it follows that each several thing finds its like in the other. For were man not made out of the whole in every part of the whole, he could not be the microcosm, nor would he be capa ­ ble of attracting to himself all that is the macrocosm. But as he is made out of the whole, all that he eats out of the Great World is part of himself: for he must be maintained by that of which he is made. For as a son is born from his father and no one helps the son so naturally as the father, in the same way the curative members of the outer world help the members of the inner world. For the Great World has all the human propor ­ tions, divisions, parts, members just as man has; and man receives these in food and medicine. These parts are separated one from another for the sake of the whole and its form. In"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"science their general body is the physicum corpus. So man ’ s body receives the body of the world, as a son his father ’ s blood; for these are one blood and one body, separated only by the soul, but in science without separation. It follows then that heaven and earth, air and water are a man in science, and man is a world with heaven and earth, air and water in science. So the Saturn of the microcosm receives from Saturn in the heavens, as the Jupiter of the heavens takes from the Jupiter of the microcosm. The melissa of the earth takes from the melissa of the micro ­ cosm . . . and they are all in union. Therefore heaven and earth, air and water are one substance, not four, nor two, nor three, but one. Where they arc not in union, the substance has been destroyed or broken up. I. ix. 94-5 ____________ OPUS PARAMIRUM (1530-1) _____________ 85 6.15 We must therefore understand that when we administer medi ­ cine, we administer the whole world: that is, all the virtue of heaven and earth, air and water. Because if there is sickness in the body, all the healthy organs must fight against it, not only one, but all. For one sickness can be death to them all: note how Nature struggles against sickness with all her power. Therefore your medicine must contain the whole firmament of both upper and lower spheres. Think with what energy Nature strives against death when she takes heaven and earth with all their powers to help her. So too must the soul fight against the devil with all her might . . . Nature has a horror of cruel and bitter death, which our eyes cannot see, nor our hands clutch. But Nature sees and knows and clutches him: therefore she employs the powers of heaven and earth against the terrible one, for terrible he is and monstrous, hideous, and harsh. As he who made him, Christ on the Mount of Olives, who sweated blood and prayed to his Father to take him away — it is reasonable that Nature should be appalled. For the better death is known, the greater is the value of medicine, a refuge which the wise seek. I. ix. 95-6"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"6.16 One may derive from this the various kinds of Mercury- diseases: in one it affects the reason, in another the blood ves­ sels, in another the tongue, and so on. It begins with a heat that inflames the body, and where this is most acute the process will occur, as if that place were an oven in which there lay Mer ­ cury. In severe cases, the whole body is convulsed and all its limbs arc in fever. It can occur that the Mercury rises and falls as in the process of distillation, then it does its worst and death is near. As already stated there are three ways. The distillation of Mercury causes a swift death; the second, the precipitation of Mercury, causes podagra [gout], chiragra, and arthritis; the third, the sublimation of Mercury, causes mania and brain fever. Mercury is so subtle that it can permeate the bones and flesh, causing pustules, gall trouble, syphilis, leprosy, and such like, and in the rising of the heat it brings about shivering, cold sweats, and shaking . . . I. ix. 102-4 86 ___________________ PARACELSUS ____________________ 6.17 Just as Mercury can be produced, so Salt as another of the three substances can cause diseases. Salt is subject to four processes: resolution, calcination, reverberation, and alkalification, which all occur in the body as in the outside world. Thus too much Salt goes into solution in people who indulge in overeating or lechery. In these, Salt is converted into fat. Obese bodies are like land which has been over-manured, it brings fruit too quickly on, or like land which as suffered an excess of rain, causing the fruit to decay . . . Salt is calcined when fluid is with ­ drawn and alum is formed. This causes perspiration, itching skin, later on scabs and sores . . . When it is reverberated, it goes up and down as though distilled. Vital spirit blown upon its surface makes it mucilaginous and sticky, and in this form it is driven by the fever to the surface of the body, when it appears in the form of rusty wounds called vn\\nera aeruginosa. Any external disease, notably ulcers, cancers, baldness, pustu- lae, scars, condylometa, morphea, and leprosy, are Salt-diseases,"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"varying according to the type of Salt. For it is Salt which gives form to all things. I. ix. 105-8 ____________ OPUS PARAMIRUM (1530-1) _____________ 87 6.18 It is the four elements which can break down and transform Sulphur. They are the artists which transmute Sulphur and cause it to generate disease in four types, cold, hot, moist, and dry. Know then that each element contains some coldness within it, but coldness is the element earth. Coldness can be either hard or moist. Hardness is twofold; congealed or frozen, coagu ­ lated or fluid; moistness is twofold; dissolved or melted, resolved or decomposed. A fiery coldness causes congealmcnt, like frozen water, snow, fine gravel, and so on. Thus a con- gealment in Sulphur can be likened to those diseases having a similarity to snow, frost, and gravel. The coagulation of cold ­ ness derives from the element water and is solid, while conge ­ lation is volatile. Examples of the coagulation are coral, alum, entalia, and aluminium salts, and diseases which come from coagulated coldness, the coldness of water, have a similar form. A coldness also comes from the air, neither congealed nor coagulated but a wind, so that such wind colds, chaos colds, and air colds can be found in the body. These diseases also resemble the cold plants, solatrum, rosa, lactuca, portulaca, and so on ... There is also an element fire in the earth which inflames Sulphur. You can see hare ’ s foot and nettle growing in the earth, and thus you can recognize these energies when present in the physical body . . . You also have a moistness from the four elements . . . and it is the same with dryness . . . Thus there are four species of this kind of disease, and they can be reasonably understood in these categories. I. ix. 108-12 6.19 There are influences which cause sweating, purgation, heat, and the like, and which must be reckoned with, for they are specific maladies: they do not spring from visible causes, but are innate and of such a nature that one man has a tendency to sweat,"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"another to purgation, another to this, another to that. For know that trom the spermata far more births are present than actu ­ ally take place. The camphor and other plants demonstrate that, and this is the cause of diseases in the bladder and kidneys. Such too is tartar which forms stone. What is hereditary we cannot eradicate; for the seed must produce all that is dormant within it. But it is not necessarily hereditary to be born blind; and although a man may be born blind, sight may be in him although not properly developed. If a man has six fingers on one hand and four on the other, or they arc not in their right places, nothing can be done for him, because the defect is in the substance of the body. But no experienced physician can say that the blind man may not be helped, for Nature is great and wonderful, and if sight is within him it may be produced, for sight is a wind which has no body and it may be guided to its own place, which cannot be done in the case of the deformed body. Innate things are like the hardness of iron and the colour of chalk and must be accepted as they come. For we cannot prevent snow from falling, but we can prevent it from doing harm to men. I. ix. 113-14 88 ___________________ PARACELSUS ____________________ 6.20 Just so is the sperm of man which is limbus and in the four ele ­ ments. Know now that it has such a power; these powers are best called influences, for they are influences. But it is an astro ­ nomical error when men say that an influence comes from the stars. The heavens send no influences. We receive our form from the hand of God. Whatever we may be, God has made us and carved all our organs. Our conditions, properties, habits, we receive from the inbreathing of life wherewith these things are given to us. What diseases we have come to us from three sub ­ stances, as already described, which have something to impress on us, as fire in wood or straw, or saffron on water. That is the influence which we cannot drive away from us, as we can drive away the maladies originating from the limbus outside us. Thus it is an impression from the sperm and we cannot drive it away. Men speak of an inclinatio : it is nonsense. They say man"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"receives an inclinatio from Mars, Saturn, the Moon, and so on. This is error and deception. It would be more reasonable to say 'Mars imitates man ’ , for man is greater than Mars or the other planets. He who knows the heavens and understands men says nothing. He might say: ‘ Man is so noble in God ’ s eyes and so highly accounted that his image is counterfeited in the heavens with all that he does and leaves undone, his good and his evil. ’ But that is not inclinatio. The relationship between heaven and man is twofold: the first that his image is counter ­ feited in heaven; the second is the prelude, in that all men ’ s future work, mode of life, and behaviour is represented in advance, but in the form of a prophecy rather than a cause. I. ix. 114-16 ____________ OPUS PARAMIRUM (1530-1) _____________ 89 6.21 As we find written in the Scriptures, we must rise on the last day in our body and give account of our misdeeds. The body which is nothing in our eyes has sinned and must rise again with us. For we shall not give an account of our diseases nor of our health and the like, but of the things which proceed from the heart, for these concern man, and these too are a body, not out of the limbus but from the breath of God. But since we shall in our flesh see God our Saviour, it must be that the body made of the limbus, which is our body of flesh, shall be there too. Who would wish to be ignorant of those things revealed through the mouth of God? We shall rise again in the flesh, in the body made from the limbus , which has its own measure and uses, and what exceeds that comes from the intangible body which transcends the bounds of Nature. I. ix. 117-18 6.22 All that is growing and living must eat, and thus they need a stomach and the virtue of digestion. Now food has consti ­ tuents pure and impure; the good thing is separated from the bad and is used to nourish the organism the bad thing cannot be assimilated by the anatomy of the organism, but retains its own anatomy. Yet it remains in that organism. Thus the organ ­"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"ism contains stercus [refuse] as well as nourishment. It is this stercus which matters here . . . Now the human stomach, the first stomach which is suspended from the neck-tube, can but achieve the first digestion, separating the good things from the stercus , which it then delegates to the subtle stomach which is in the mesenteric vessels, in the liver, kidneys, bladder, and gut. Thus there are refuse materials in the body which are neither faeces in the ordinary sense nor subject to incorporation in man. They cannot be broken down, yet they are not man and they remain in man. Now there are such diseases which are caused by this refuse and vary according to the degree of separation and the location of the refuse. These diseases are stone and sand, glue and mud. Now tell me how your humours could become stone, sand, mud, and glue without being so originally. These four are four types of refuse from food. They are all known as tartar. I. ix. 123-5 90 ___________________ PARACELSUS ____________________ 6.23 One should know how we ingest tartar. It is in the vegetables like barley and peas which you can deduce from the mucus they produce and their thick texture. All kinds of food with this mucus lead to stone in the body. Milk products, meat, and fish have sand in them and this becomes tartar. In the same way we have two kinds of excrement in drink, wine and water. But one should note that fruit juices like pear and apple juice may be compared with wine and water. But beer has two kinds of tartar in it, those of vegetables and the water from which it is made. There is a mitigating factor in these drinks, in so far as they pass quickly through the body, and the less they are digested, the better it is. Because a strong digestion quickly produces stone or tartar, it is better to have a weak digestion. A weak digestion never produces stone or tartar, but an ardent strong one is so quick and thorough, that it lets nothing through. That is why one man may have tartar, the other none . . . Know too that the two kinds of tartar in drink vary accord­ ing to the nature and property of countries . . . Thus it may happen that a Swiss suffers from a Nuremberg or Westcnburg"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"tartar owing to the consumption of cereals and vegetables imported from those places. I. ix. 128-30 ____________ OPUS PARAMIRUM (1530-1) _____________ 91 6.24 How does tartar finally develop in the lungs, gall-bladder, heart, spleen, brain, and kidneys? Each of these organs must cat and take its daily nourishment from the stomach. Each organ in the body acts as its own stomach and separates out what is not good for it, and no organ performs this separation or ‘ cook ­ ing ’ for another one, save the stomach, which does so on behalf of the liver, kidneys and bladder, that is on behalf of the whole community of organs. But this communal function is not suffi ­ cient, so that each organ must perform the process and thereby achieve its own specific nutrition. Whatever such an organ rejects is excrement and must be disposed of by many kinds of exits, the lungs coughing it up, the brain emitting it through the nose, the spleen through the blood vessels, the bile through the stomach, the kidneys through the bladder, the heart into a chaos . . . The tartar in these organs is not visible, because it is volatile and goes into these organs like a brandy that evaporates and appears to be devoid of body. It is there, however, and even if it is placed in a still and circulates, it still has the tartar in itself. I. ix. 147-8 6.25 If one reckons how much a man cats and then subtracts the refuse and urine, only a small part can remain in the body. That is why only a small amount of tartar can be found in the individual organs besides the pathways of the urine and the gut . . . This applies to the tartar in the lungs, which appears in men and beasts as small stones resembling wheat or millet seeds. The bronchial tubes arc the stomach of the lungs, in which it separates the pure from the impure. Hence there is a specific lung excrement in the air tubes, in which it is dis ­ tilled, and from which it should be coughed up. If it is not, but remains there, it is transformed into fine leaves, slate par-"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"tides, and granules and obstructs the air tubes, preventing their free movement up and down in respiration and causing many kinds of disease. These are called asthma, coughing, phthisis, and hectic fever, yet they all derive from tartar in the lungs. I. ix. 149-51 92 ___________________ PARACELSUS ____________________ 6.26 The stomach of the brain lies outside it in the upper interior parts of the nose, and it is through the latter that brain excre ­ ment is voided. It is here in the brain ’ s stomach that tartar is found, causing insanity, mania, and similar disorders, commonly and erroneously attributed to the blood . . . You should know more about the kidneys. Although the urine is in the kidneys, they do not nourish themselves from it, but take another food in common with the other organs . . . Thus the kidneys also have their particular excrement which is contained in the urine and is excreted with it and is the hypostasis (deposit). Hence the deposit gives a verdict on kidney problems . . . There is an art in the separation of the deposit from the urine, and whoever can do it, can see the excrement of the kidneys clearly and therein the stones. I. ix. 152-3 6.27 Now it is necessary to discuss the same processes in the outer world. The same kind of stones derive from the waters of the elements which are productive of stone. They rise up in the form of dew and end up in heaven as the primae materiac of the stones. The still world harbours in itself the generation of these strange things — invisible to philosophy — but visible in their ultimate result. Now when the products of Salt prevail in heaven and encounter this dew, meteorites are formed which fall to earth until the heaven is empty. These astra and elements arc in the body as they are in heaven. All men are heavens, made from one limbus. It therefore follows that a stone is suddenly produced in man, each time that a body is produced in heaven . . .

Then heaven and earth became a matrix, in which Adam was formed by the hand of God. Then woman was created out of man; she is the matrix of all men until the end of the world. What did the first matrix contain within itself? As the kingdom of God it encompassed the spirit of God. The world encloses the eternal, by which it is itself surrounded. Woman is enclosed in her own skin, and everything within it forms the matrix. Thus her body cannot be compared with that of man, although she was taken from him. It is true that she resembles him, for she has received his image, but in all other things, in essence, properties, nature, and peculiarities, she is quite different from him. For man suffers as man, woman suffers as woman, both suffer as two creatures beloved of God. He proves this with the twofold medicine which he gives us: a masculine medicine for men, a feminine medicine for women. I. ix. 192-3 6.29 God created man from the matrix without any aid or other agency. He took him from the matrix and made a man of him. Moreover this was never repeated, as He gave the limbus to man in his natural being, so that he might be the limbus , that is become his own son. And when he wants to have the son, He gave him a matrix of his own, namely woman. Henceforth there will be progeny from two, not from man, nor from the mother by herself, but from man in the matrix. To that end there will be two, and yet only one; two kinds of flesh, yet only one, not two. This means that both make man, neither can alone.

The sea is the mother of water. Because woman is a mother, she produces such rivers in herself, which rise up and flow out every four weeks . . . Thus the menstrual blood is an excrement of things flowing into the matrix, which die there and are then expelled. Some doctors have mistakenly called the menstrual blood a blossom of women. Women blossom at the moment of conception, and the fruit — that is the child — follows as in the case of all blossoms . . . When a tree blossoms, it is always because of the fruit that desires to ripen in it, and the tree in which no fruit lies hidden does not blossom. According to the erroneous analogy, a virgin may blossom, but she has no fruit in her . . . Do you not realize that the matrix is nothing but the microcosm?! If it is to give birth, then it must be pure . . . thus she remains pure until the milk ceases. As long as preg ­ nancy lasts, there is no excrement, for all things are quiet and bide their time . . . For this is the nature of woman, that she is transformed as soon as she conceives; and then all things in her arc like a summer, there is no snow, no frost, and no winter, but only pleasure and delight. I. ix. 196-8 6.31 A woman is like a tree bearing fruit. And man is like the fruit that the tree bears. The tree must be well nourished until it has everything that it needs in order to give, which is why it is there. But consider how much injury the tree can bear and how much less the pears. By that much woman is also superior to man. Man is to her what the pear is to the tree. The pear falls but the tree remains standing. The tree continues to care for further fruit in the course of its long life, therefore it must also receive much, suffer much, bear up with much for the sake"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"of its fruits, in order that they may thrive well and happily . . . Thus you must note what is wrong with the tree but not wrong with the pears, and what is wrong with the pears but not wrong with the tree. And similarly in the case of women and men.

I. ix. 200-1 ____________ OPUS PARAMIRUM (1530-1) _____________ 95 6.32 Thus is the microcosm, that is the matrix or the Little World, and it contains within itself all the minerals. It follows that the body can take its medicine from the world and thus it also fol­ lows that all minerals may have some benefit for man, each one according to the mineral in the microcosm or body. These things are revealed by philosophy, on which medicine is based. When the physician says that marcasite [bismuth] is good for this, then he must know beforehand that marcasite is in the world and that it is in the human microcosm. This is how the philosopher speaks. If he wants to speak as a physician, however, he must say, this marcasite is the man ’ s disease, hence it will cure him. A hole rotting in the skin and eating into the body, what else is it but a mineral? Then follows: colcothar mends the hole. Why? Because colcothar is the salt that makes the hole. Thus Mercury cures the holes which it has provoked and other Arsenicals do likewise. I. ix. 210-11 6.33 How marvellously man is made and formed, if one only knows how to penetrate into his true nature, understand what he is, and work out all his details. And it is a great thing, which you should consider: there is nothing in heaven or in earth that is not also in man. For these are the heavenly powers which work in him. For God, who is in heaven, is in man. Where else can heaven be if not in man? As we need it, it must be within us. Therefore it knows our prayer even before we have uttered it, for it is closer to our hearts than to our words. God made his heaven in man great and beautiful, noble and good. For God"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"is in his heaven, that is in man, for He tells us Himself that He is in us and that we are His temple.

Although this aspect is invisible, it may be seen in the light of Nature . . . We men on earth, what do we know about phenomena without the light of Nature? It is the light of Nature that makes invisible things visible. Whatever the eyes can see requires little proof, but much proof is necessary to adduce something invisible as visible. You should know that the world and all we see in it is but a half part of the world, and the part which we do not see is just as much involved in its motion, nature, and properties. And there is a half part of man in which the invisible world is effective and finds its counterpart. Thus these two worlds make two men in one body. Creatures arc so wonderful that they can be investigated in the light of Nature, both in what God has made invisible in them and in that which we can see. Thus God applies his magnalia, that is works, and thus is the school of the light of Nature, that we should not only satisfy our eyes but wonder and investigate the phenomena which we cannot see and yet which confront us as clearly as a pillar stands before a blind man . . . Consider this example: one cannot see colours in moonlight but one can see them clearly in sunlight. The light of Nature similarly surpasses the light ol the sun ... it sur ­ passes all the powers of sight. I. ix. 252-3 6.35 It is the same when we hear a bell on a dark night; we cannot sec it and yet we do sec the work of the bell, that is we hear it.

Dionysius the Areopagite understood astrology but he could not understand the mean ­ ing of Christ on the Cross in its light; he did not want to be drowned [overwhelmed] by the work, but he wanted to under ­ stand the Creator, so he sought another light and found it. For whoever seeks and knocks, he shall find. So we will find dis ­ eases, whose origin cannot be understood in the visible body, which exhort us not to say ‘ it is beyond my understanding ’ , but to kindle the light in order that we can say, ‘ it within our understanding ’ . I. ix. 253-5 ____________ OPUS PARAMIRUM (1530-1) _____________ 97 6.36 That is why I wanted to warn you, reader, to understand clearly all the following diseases, because just as all works are visible, so too must be their causes. And do not be downcast that all things arc not as clear as day, but consider how secretive God is. And when we learn something, we discover that wc errone ­ ously called the invisible things invisible, for all works teach us that they have a cause. Likewise a house is a work and is visible, the master-craftsman is a work of God and the house is the work of the master-craftsman. It should be understood that we see the works visibly before our eyes, and once we have investigated its author, that is also visible to us. In matters eternal it is belief that makes all things visible, in matters corporeal it is the light of Nature that reveals all things invisible.

Who is so daring as to guess at all Nature ’ s powers? For these powers all proceed from divine wisdom, but who can fathom all this wisdom, when the Scriptures say that it is boundless and talk of its great profundity and mystery? What is man upon earth, what is he in his works and thoughts, when he contemplates the highest peaks in the light of Nature? Noth ­ ing, for not even if he were above the sun, or indeed above the new sun which is seven times brighter, not even here has divine wisdom begun. Because the light of Nature is like the crumbs from the table of the Lord, for all the heathen to grasp, and has departed from Judah, it behoves us not to give in, but to pick up the crumbs as long as they fall. I. ix. 306-7 98 ___________________ PARACELSUS __ _______________ 6.38 Each thing to be explained in the light of Nature must be related to the first Creation. For each beginning is the origin, property, and nature of its successor, since like does not beget unlike. The first Creation is heaven and earth, not only in their form and shape but in their natural powers and properties and man was made by the hand of God in His image from all these tilings following their creation ... So man is the Little World in form, bodily substance, and all powers and virtues corresponding to the Great World. Man thus bears the noble name ‘ microcosm ’ in the sense that all heavenly orbits, terrestrial nature, watery properties, and airy essence inhere in him. The nature of all fruits of the earth and all mineral ores of water, all the constel ­ lations, and the four winds of the world are in him. What is there upon earth whose nature and power does not reside in man? God formed man according to His image from the limbus which has no like in nobility, subtlety, and strength . . .

Melissa is there, antimony too, all things are in this mumia , and these things are all natural, only not previously recognized. Thus it behoves one to speak of microcosmic powers and explain these invisible influences, which the common folk express in terms of sorcery, witch ­ craft and Satanism, because they are all natural and have natural causes. For you must recognize a twofold nature in the human body: a tangible virtue and an intangible virtue; for both the visible body and the invisible body have their natural influences. I. ix. 309-10 6.40 If one was to regard such events as Christ ’ s resurrection [and the wonders of the Saints] as natural phenomena and signs, then Christ ’ s words 'there will be great signs ’ would be confirmed. But ignorance caused man to see these events as supernatural, just as the first practitioners of medicine were revered as gods by the common folk. The same thing occurs in the case of these bodies [of Christ and the Saints] because one did not know that virtues inhered in them. The unglorified body is nothing but a natural object. Coloquinth purges and all arcana for that matter act in heathens as well as Christians. Nature is simply following its own inherent order and command. I. ix. 319 6.41 Things arc innate in us . . .

Because no one can see it, the body of medicine is of no account . . . If Death can creep in and throttle and kill us, so too can medicine. It is not a mat ­ ter of body but of virtues, which is why the fifth essence was invented, of which one loth [half an ouncel is superior to the twenty pounds of the body from which it was extracted.

Know therefore that the elements of physical bodies are . . . mothers [matrices], and from them grow good and evil, health and disease, purity and impurity, thorns and roses, gold and talcum, hail and dew, manna and mist, and the same things erupt in man, who incor ­ porates the same virtue of the thistles and the lilies, quicksil ­ ver and gold pigment, and all creations proceed from him. These are the diseases of man, and the physician must know all such procreations.

Whoever can take a species and recognize it in the physical body by saying that is sapphire in man, that is mercury, that is cypress, that is gold essence, has understood the book of the physical body well. And thereupon he is a physician and finds his the ­ ory, which is not merely speculative but founded in practice. For practice should not flow from speculative theory, but the ­ ory should flow rather from practice . . . When the physician has related the anatomical concordance of the macrocosm and the microcosm, each in their specific place, then it follows that there is a different disease of the leg, another of the flesh, another of the blood, just as there are [certain kinds of] worms in wood, other worms in plants, and still others in leaves. There are as many diseases as there are species. I. xi. 182-3 102 ___________________ PARACELSUS ___________________ 7.3 Now alchemy is an art which is necessary and must exist. Because it represents the art of Vulcan, it is important to know what Vulcan can do. Alchemy is an art, Vulcan is its artist . . . Now God created all things; He created something out of noth ­ ing. That something is a seed, which contains within itself its appointed end, its determination, its office, its task. Just as all things have been created from nothing, there is yet nothing which is completely perfect; that is to say, it has not been finished, but Vulcan must complete it. All things arc created as far as we know them, but not as far as they should be. Wood grows, but not into coals or logs; clay grows, but not into ear ­ then pots. Thus it is with all growth, and one should under ­ stand the significance of Vulcan. Take an example: God has created iron, but not what can be made from it, namely horse ­ shoes, rods, sickles; He simply gives us iron ore. He then tells the fire and Vulcan what to do: the iron must be separated from"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"_ LABYRINTHUS MEDICORUM ERRANTIUM (1538) _ 103 the dross and then whatever is to be made should be forged. That is alchemy and the foundryman is called Vulcan; whatever the fire does is alchemy— likewise in the kitchen and in the oven. Thus it is also with medicine: it is created by God but incom ­ plete and buried in the dross . . . The dross must be removed and then the medicine is available. That is alchemy and the office of Vulcan. I. xi. 186-8 7.4 Take the example of bread. The external art of alchemy in the baker ’ s oven cannot produce ultimate matter, but only inter ­ mediate matter. Nature first produces the harvest; then alchemy reaps, mills, and bakes it before it reaches the mouth. At this point prime and intermediate matter have been created; now the alchemy of the microcosm commences. This [alchemy] has prime matter in the mouth: bread. It is chewed and digested, so that it becomes flesh and blood, and thus it is now ultimate matter . . . Thus Nature deals with us as creatures of God . . . Nothing is created as ultimate matter. But all things are created as prime matter and Vulcan converts them through the art of alchemy into ultimate matter. The Archeus, the inner Vulcan, follows suit; it knows how to distinguish parts and to circu ­ late and distribute them according to the arts of sublimation, distillation, and reverberation. These arts are also within man just as they are present in external alchemy, which is its model. Thus are Vulcan and the Archeus to be distinguished from each other. I. xi. 188 7.5 God ordained it so. A physician must consider — as God has created nothing in its final form, but simply ordered Vulcan to do his part — how to bring these things to their [appointed] end and not to mix up the dross and the iron. For instance, bread is created and given to us by God, but not as it comes from the baker, but through the three Vulcans, the peasant, the miller, and the baker; they make bread out of it. Thus must"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"medicine operate with the inner Vulcan. Therefore no physi ­ cian should be ashamed of alchemy. For what I have described can only be achieved by alchemy.

And just as the pear tree retains its own scientia, . . . one should understand that God has given each his [particular] scientia , whereupon it follows that each should develop his gift and scientia to the utmost, alchemically speaking, to the highest degree . . . Each should further his own gift, in order that he reach his end, and not learn his innate scientia from other creatures. For this [scientia] is given to him alone, not to the others, from whom you think you can learn. Why would the pear tree learn from the sloe tree? Why the fig tree from the thorns? . . . Thus follows the book of scientia, that we experience scientia ... It is scientia to make a patient healthy. But this scientia is the medicine, not the physician . . .

If these things have to travel in order to come to you, so you have to travel until you reach those things which cannot go to you. For the arts have no feet so that the butcher may drive them to you; they cannot be shipped in tubs nor sealed in barrels; and because they have this shortcoming, you must do what they ought to. The English humours are not Hungarian, nor the Neapolitan ones Prussian. Therefore you must go where they are. And the more you seek them there and the more you experience, the greater is your understanding in your own coun ­ try. The physician must also be an alchemist. If he wishes to be such, he must sec the mother [matrix] from which the minerals grow. Now the mountains will not follow him, but he must follow them. Where the minerals are, there also are the artists [experts]; if one wants to seek artists in the separa ­ tion and preparation of Nature, one must seek them at the place where the minerals are.

Those who sit within the city walls can keep cool and warm as they wish; those in the arts — but for the tree, they would have no shade. Whoever wants to serve his stomach does not follow me; he follows those who go in soft clothes, which would be no use for travelling.

Therefore they also heed the same motto: in order that they will not be murdered, they remain behind the stove and turn pears over. So I think that I have done my travelling properly up until now and consider it an achievement and no disgrace. He who wishes to explore Nature must tread her books with his feet. Writing is learned from letters, but Nature by travelling from country to coun ­ try. One country, one page.

If these are to be understood properly, it is necessary to divide them up into their species. Although this classification is neglected by other philosophies, it should not be omitted. Firstly, it is sagacious because God gave unto men all the arts and everything that is natural through the medium of the heavens, because the heavens are the light of Nature. Next, it is useful, for all the necessary arts spring from it. The great art of medicine has its cornerstone in the art of astronomy, as does the disease of man, his health, and his death. Whoever heeds this not is in error. For the physician who does not under ­ stand astronomy cannot be called a complete physician, because more than half of all diseases are governed by the heavens. Fur ­ thermore this sagacious art is not complete in astronomy but also with respect to the eternal wisdom. Note furthermore that the art of astronomy enables one to understand the innate secrets of the heart and the good and evil in the nature of man. The reason is that man is made out of the Great World and has his nature therein. And because there is one human nature deriv ­ ing from the earth and another from the heavens, it is neces­ sary to discover what each one says."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"I make it abundantly clear that everything in which man is subject to the light of Nature comes from the stars. All natural arts and human wisdom arc given by the stars, we are the pupils ot the stars, and they our teacher. God has ordered everything in the light of Nature, so that we may learn from it. The false prophets destroy this art, and the false physicians arise from the neglect of this cornerstone. They do not know what the light of Nature teaches, not what God teaches, nor whence come the perishable and the eternal. They do not understand themselves, because supposing and thinking are separated from knowing and ability by art: that is to say, astronomy teaches with great reason how all things come to pass. Whatever is divine is learnt from God; whatever concerns the perishable is learnt from the heavens. In order that this preface be not unduly long, you should know that many claim to be astronomers. They seek long words but the little pearl of truth is lost. Now I will shortly show you the art of astronomy in nine parts; whoever understands them properly has become an astronomer. As I say to start with, I must show all the species, in order that it is understood that astronomy is the mother of all other arts. The good physician, the good philosopher, justice, the eter ­ nal wisdom, and the light of Nature arc grounded in astronomy. Likewise with religion, and no art can be perfected without astronomy. And once we have understood the light of Nature properly, we arc more able to understand all things that God works through man . . .

But the magician dismisses the astrologer, the instrument-maker, and the reader of signs. But the reader of signs despises all of the other six. The diviner says nothing to the other six. The necromancer does not know the assump ­ tions of the others. The practitioner of uncertain arts considers himself the best. The instrument-maker uses the instruments and gets involved a little everywhere . . .

I. xii. 3-7 __________ ASTRONOMIA MAGNA (1537-8) __________ ill 9.2 There are two kinds of wisdom in this world — one eternal and one temporal. The eternal wisdom springs directly from the light of the Holy Ghost, the other wisdom directly from the light of Nature. The one that comes from the light of the Holy Ghost is of only one species — it is the just and flawless wis ­ dom. But the one that comes from the light of Nature com ­ prises two species: good and evil. The good wisdom is joined to the Eternal, the evil to damnation ... Is it not a great treas ­ ure of man to distinguish eternal wisdom from temporal wis ­ dom, because he is the image of God, and to understand that the mortal is worthless when compared with the eternal? There ­ fore he should always seek what corresponds to this image, and know how to distinguish a good and an evil kind of temporal wisdom. Thus he can accept the evil or the good and yet know what serves evil and whither the good goes . . . And of this other wisdom let him retain only the good kind, and reject the evil kind. For wisdom docs not command you, but you alone command yourself.

I know well that the light of Nature is not eternal, but that I must become eternal through the eternal light. But might one not combine the mortal light of the soul with the eternal light? The body and the soul are two together. Can one not use the two lights, just as God has given man two essences, the elemental and the eternal, until such time as they are united at the resurrection? Thus the elemental is assigned to the earth, and the eternal to the kingdom of God. I have written as a Christian and am no heathen, I am a German. I. xii. 10-12 112 ___________________ PARACELSUS ___________________ 9.4 Man has two bodies: one from the earth, the second from the stars, and thus they are easily distinguishable. The elemental, material body goes to the grave along with its essence; the side ­ real, subtle body dissolves gradually and goes back to its source, but the spirit of God in us, which is like His image, returns to Him whose image it is. Thus each part dies in that medium from which it has been created, and finds rest accordingly. I. xii. 18 9.5 Christ and His apostles prophesy the seasons of the nations, but the astronomer prophesies the seasons of Nature. This is a great difference; take good note of it, you naturalists and theologians. For what God prophesies happens and nothing can prevent it. But what the astronomer says, may or may not happen. Thus prophecy springs from one source, astronomy from another. The true knowledge of man ’ s essence can be attained only on the basis of his life; it cannot be understood by any other sign. I. xii. 119 9.6 The world machine is made of two parts — one tangible and"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"perceptible, and the other invisible and imperceptible. The tan ­ gible part is the body, the invisible is the stars. The tangible part is in turn composed of three parts —Sulphur, Mercury, and Salt; the invisible also consists of three parts — feeling, wisdom, and art. The two parts together constitute life ... All crea ­ tures in the world are made thus; and all creatures arc divided into these two parts, the sensible and the insensible. The sen ­ sible is twofold, the rational and irrational, but both relate to the animal nature. Men know by reason what they should do and when to do it, they have judgement, whereas the beasts are irrational. All sentient being is governed by the stars, men in a human fashion, the beasts in an animal fashion . . . Human reason in the arts, mood, and wisdom comes to man from the stars; animal nature is simply a matter of eating and drinking. The beasts take their nature from the stars, but man draws his mortal wisdom, reason, and art from the stars — and everything that comes from the light of Nature must be learned from the light of Nature, excepting only the image of God, which is sub ­ ject to the spirit which the Lord has given to man. The spirit instructs man in supernatural and eternal things, and after the separation of matter from spirit it returns to the Lord. For it is given to man only as a schoolmaster to illuminate him in things eternal. I. xii. 20-1 __________ ASTRONOMIA MAGNA (1537-8) __________ 113 9.7 The light of Nature in man comes from the stars, and his flesh and blood come from the material elements. Thus two in ­ fluences operate in man. The first is the heavenly light in natural wisdom, art, and reason. All these are the children of this father . . . The second influence emanates from matter and includes concupiscence, eating, drinking, and everything that relates to the flesh and blood. Therefore one must not attribute to the stars that which originates in the flesh and blood. For heaven docs not make anyone unchaste or greedy . . . From heaven come only wisdom, art, and reason ...

Thus the stars teach us all the arts that exist on earth; and if the stars were not active in us, and we had been compelled to do everything by ourselves, no art would ever have come into being . . . Just as the constellations of the heavens have been so constantly renewed from the days of Adam down to our own time, so new arts arise from year to year. And not only the arts, but also all wars, all governments, and everything which our brains produce, receive their guidance from the stars now and for ever. And were all musicians and all craftsman to die, this schoolmaster would remain . . . and would always instruct new ones. I. xii. 23 9.9 Not all the stars have yet completed their action and imprinted their influences. Thus, the invention of arts has not yet come to an end. For this reason no one who has discovered some ­ thing new or who undertakes to explore some unknown field should be held back . . . Give heed to those who each day seek something new and also each day find something new, whatever it may be — whether in natural wisdom, arts or custom. For the heavens are responsible for it.

And it remains for man to decide what portion of these things he should take to him ­ self and what he should not.

Knowledge and science thus obtained are admittedly limited and transient. Yet it is a divine gift to investigate in the light of Nature. Thus, even before the birth of Christ, the world was endowed with scientific know ­ ledge. But man degenerated, and now he expounds the fig ­ ments of his own imagination; false wisdom, false arts, and false medicine which have nothing to do with the light of Nature. At the time of Christ this was the intellectual conduct of the Pharisees and scribes, and through their foolishness astronomy was forgotten. Christ taught the eternal wisdom and his mira ­ cles overwhelmed the light of Nature; the arts of magic, divi ­ nation, and other species of astronomy were thus neglected as a lesser light. People thought it was better to follow Christ than to follow Nature, better to be an apostle than a magus, better to be a prophet than an astronomer. Thus Dionysius the Areopagitc renounced astronomy at Athens and followed in the steps of St Paul. I. xii. 26-7 __________ ASTRONOMIA MAGNA (1537-8) __________ 115 9.11 But logic intervened to extinguish both the light of Nature and the light of wisdom and introduced an alien doctrine which relegated both kinds of wisdom. These people began to extin ­ guish the lights of the eternal and Nature and to darken their truth before the time of Christ. But Christ and His followers took nothing away from the light of Nature, it was the old leaven of the Pharisees who move about in the schools, ana ­ lyse, and want to break the power of Nature. They follow neither Christ nor the light of Nature. They are the dead who bury the dead; there is no life in their work, because they have no light in which they can learn anything, much as they wish to act as both the natural and eternal lights themselves.

Consequently, if a philo ­ sopher is not born out of theology, he has no cornerstone upon which to base his philosophy. For truth springs from theology, and cannot be discovered without its help. I. xii. 32 9.14 Man was not born out of a nothingness, but was made from a substance . . . The Scriptures prove that God took the limus terrae [the primordial stuff of the earth], and formed man out of this mass. Furthermore, they prove that man is ashes and powder, dust and earth; and this proves sufficiently that he is made of the primordial substance . . . This dust is limus terrae. But limus terrae is also the Great World, and thus man was created from heaven and earth, that is from the upper and lower creations . . . Limus terrae is an extract of the firmament and the elements. I. xii. 33 9.15 After God had created all creatures, elements, and stars in accor ­ dance with His will, he finally resolved to make man in the following manner: he took each of the four elements and also extracted the essence of wisdom, art, and reason from the stars.

And moreover, the fifth essence is the whole basis and core of all essences and properties of the whole world; the hand of God held all Nature, virtues, and properties and essences in the upper and lower regions and formed man out of these in His image. I. xii. 36-7 __________ ASTRONOMIA MAGNA (1537-8) 9.16 The fifth essence is extracted from two bodies and has been combined in one body to form man . . .

Therefore man is the fifth essence, the microcosm and the son of the whole world, because he has been created as an extract of all creation by the hand of God . . .

The beginning of magic is an explanation of the un ­ natural signs and how one may recognize them both super- naturally in heaven and also naturally, as in the case of the star over Bethlehem. This star stood among the other stars as Christ wandered on earth as a man among other men. The stars will be recognized only by the magi, just as Christ was recognized only by his own kind. Thus the magi are interpreters of the supernatural signs in heaven, just as the Apostles were expo ­ nents of Christ. Thus the magi are also interpreters of all prophecies and the apocalyptic revelation. This is the species of magical art and is called the insignis magica. There is a fur ­ ther species of magic which occurred at the time of Moses and concerns the transformation of one body into another.

So should this magic be understood and this species is called magica transfigurativa. The third species teaches how to make words which can summon the powers of heaven. For example: this species can achieve by words every ­ thing that the physician is able to achieve through medicine. This species is called characteralis. The fourth species teaches how to make cameos and gems which can achieve all that is possi ­ ble by natural means. For example, a key opens a lock, a sword cuts wounds, a suit of armour protects from stabbing and shoot ­ ing; thus the fourth species of magic can do invisibly by art what Nature can do visibly. This species is called gamaheos. The fifth species teaches how to make pictures which will bring about what they portray. Whatever can be done naturally can be done with this magic: just as Nature can bring great pain, paralyse, blind, or render a man impotent, and also make cer ­ tain men healthy again, so too can this magic do, and it is called altera in alteram. Magic can also make it possible for one to hear another ’ s voice from the other side of the ocean, and also for one in the West to talk with another in the East. If Nature ena ­ bles one to hear a voice a hundred paces away, this species ena ­ bles one to hear it a hundred German miles off. And just as Nature makes it possible for a messenger or a steed to travel a certain distance in a month, this species can make it possible within a day. Whatever Nature requires a year for, this magic can achieve it in a month. This species is called ars cabalistica. These six species constitute the magical art. . . Explanation of nigromantia and its species: nigromantia is divided into five species. Firstly, following the death of a man, there remain two mortal spirits on earth, the elemental and the side­ real. Whoever understands these two spirits, their properties, nature, and behaviour, is proficient in the first species of nigro- mancy, which is called cognito mortalem. Whoever can deal with these mortal spirits and command them to do his business is proficient in the second species of nigromancy. It is possible to treat the abandoned spirit as a servant, and this species is called tortura noctis. The third species concerns the spirits which arc born in the heavens and hover in chaos before dying and"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"being born again. Now whoever can exploit these spirits as a physician can exploit herbs is proficient in the third species of nigromancy, which is called meteorica vivens. Whoever can injure a man without making an opening in his body, just as one can seize a fish out of water without making a hole or put something into water without making a hole, is proficient in the fourth species of nigromancy: that is, he can withdraw something from and insert something in the body. This spe ­ cies is called clausura nigromantica. Whoever knows how to make a visible body invisible and conceal it as the night can make a man invisible is proficient in the fifth species of nigromancy, and this is called obcaecatio nigromantica. Explanation of nectromantia [sic] and its species: nectromantia is divided into fourteen species. The first of these several kinds is knows as visiones and may be understood by an example: a master has a servant, to whom he entrusts all his secrets. Now if one wishes to know these secrets and the master will not reveal them, one must learn them from the servant. One may similarly understand nectromancy [sic] as a means of knowing the hidden secrets of men. A man may think that he is quite alone, but there is something present, which we cannot see, in all our words and works. This thing is privy to the secrets of man and is called Jlaga [familiar spirit]. Whoever is able to subdue them and make them obedient to his will, as one might the servant of a master, is proficient in nectromancy. Now although there are many kinds of species in this member, these are just two types. The first consists in the Jlagae becoming visi ­ ble, the second in their effecting the nectromantic will unseen. It is the art of knowing the secrets of men, as far as it is possi ­ ble to do outside their hearts. An example: whatever a man does not keep within himself but tells to another is unconcealed from this art — and whatever he physically does is not secret. For it follows that whatever is spoken or done is evident to the Jla- gae , and the nectromancer is able to understand them. Now here is an explanation of how they are to be understood. One must encourage them or force them to reveal such secrets, as one would with a secretary. One can make the Jlagae obedient and also visible by means of a mirror, glass, and coals. And __________ ASTRONOMIA MAGNA (1537-8) __________ 127"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"128 . . ......... .. .......................PARACELSUS ___________________ it can be done invisibly by pointing and signing with the finger. Thus one can find hidden treasures; thus one can read sealed letters; thus can things hidden be laid bare; thus one can find the place where something lies hidden; and thus can things be summoned which were lost. Whoever can subject the flagae to his will to reveal the secrets of man and whatever he has hid ­ den can practise ncctromancy and is a perfect nectromancer. And whatever cannot be done pleasantly can be done with vio ­ lence. Thus nectromancy is an art of acting pleasantly or vio ­ lently. For just as a man must be subject to the Emperor and ruled by the sword, so it is possible to compel the flagae to manifest in mirrors, glasses, coals, and nails, and also to give indications by means of divining-rods, lead, and stone, etc. Also by making candles go out, so that secrets are revealed. Explanation of astrologia and its species; {astrologia is divided into thirteen species). In order to understand what astrology and an astrologer arc, note this example. Just as one can recognize how men run about on earth, to and fro, one upright, another hobbling, so one may understand the motions of the stars, and such a person is proficient in astrology. But there is more to it than that: one should know what the goal of this motion is just as one might send a messenger with a specific errand and know what he is about. Or just as one may know what a craftsman will achieve in any given day, so should the astrologer know what each star intends to do as its work. Whoever knows that is a better astrologer than one who just knows how they move amongst themselves. It is also good to know what they can achieve and what they cannot. For man begins much that he cannot complete. You should understand that in the heavens the stars begin much which cannot be com ­ pleted, just as men do. For the stars and men have similar capac ­ ities. Whoever knows men ’ s movements knows their intentions, knows what can be finished and what cannot. Astrology can pride itself on the same understanding, for it follows that the astrologer recognizes the swnmwti motorem [supreme mover] and knows that nature is in its hands. He also knows that he can ­ not change the heavens as can the supreme mover. The astrologer should know the innate nature of the stars, their"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"nature, complexion, and property, as well as a physician under ­ stands the nature of a patient, and also the concordance of the stars, how they stand in relation to men, animals, the four ele ­ ments, and all things that grow and spring from the matrices ol the elements. Whoever knows this, has authority to talk about astrology. Know furthermore that the astrologer should be able to find his bearings in the heavens with the aid of his natural reason, in a natural way, as a philosopher or a physician finds his way among the things of Nature, which derive from the elements. But he should not have a higher opinion of this art nor place more reliance on it than behoves a prisoner. The prisoner, too, has all the qualities that belong to a man, but he is prevented from unfolding them; he cannot do what he wants. The same is true of the heavens: they lie imprisoned in the hand of the supreme mover, and what this hand intends is hidden from the astrologer. Although astrology is a mem ­ ber ot astronomy, the art can be impeded, furthered, or changed by the hand of the supreme mover. But whoever knows and understands the natural properties of the stars outside the hand of the supreme mover is an astrologer and can practise astrology. Explanation ofsignatum and its species: (sign a turn is divided into four species). There is nothing that Nature has not signed in such a way that man may discover its essence. . . the stars have their motions by which they are known. The same is true of man, save that they give him fixed lines by which one can estab ­ lish the motion. And just as the motion of the stars has a com ­ plexion, so does the line of man. As you can sec, each herb is given the form that befits its nature; similarly man is endowed with a form corresponding to his inner nature. And just as the form shows what a given herb is, so the human sign indicates what a given man is. This does not refer to the name, sex, or similar characteristics, but to the properties inherent in the man. The art of signatures teaches us to give each being its true name in accordance with its innate nature. A wolf must not be called a sheep, a dove must not be called a tox; each being should receive a name that accords with its nature. Through these four species Nature makes apparent all the natural secrets which lie in man. Since nothing is so secret or hidden that it cannot be __________ ASTRONOMIA MAGNA (1537-8) __________ 129"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"130 ________________ * _ PARACELSUS ___________________ revealed, everything depends on the discovery of those things which manifest the hidden. It follows that chiromancy under ­ stands the signatures of such secrets, and the nature of each man ’ s soul accords with these lines and veins. The same is true of the face, which is shaped and formed according to the con ­ tent of the mind and soul, and the same is again true of the proportions of the human body. Thus can this member of astronomy describe each kind of soul. For the sculptor of Nature is so artful that he docs not fashion the soul to fit the form, but the form to fit the soul; that is to say, the shape of a man is formed in accordance with the manner of his heart. Nature docs not work like a painter who finishes a picture and gives it no signature, because the picture has none within it; it is like a shadow with no power. And yet, lacking power, the art pro ­ ceeds from the Maker of living beings. And the more accom ­ plished an artist would be, the more necessary it is that he master the art of signatures. The basis of these arts lies in these three species. The fourth species concerns the habits and behaviour of man, and whoever has knowledge of this is a consummate artist in signatures. Explanation ofartes incertae: (these comprise four species). These are several long-practised arts which have come down to us from the ancients; these arts are closely akin to magic and are held in great respect; the older they are, the more respected. Although the arts have not become more wicked, man and his soul have, and much depends on man. I call them uncertain arts, though they would have been certain arts at the time of the ancients. These arts are the sixth member of astronomy and treat of great wonderful secrets, which can be understood more quickly than the other members. The basis of their art is mixed as a hand casts lots. Just as the stars and the elements can work through the medium of men ’ s hands and limbs, so each man is a prophet of the natural light. Some prophecies are spoken orally, others made by gestures, other by signs, others by pic ­ tures and figures and in many other ways. Because man has these powers of divination, he is able to employ these uncer ­ tain arts. And although geomancy takes its name from the earth, pyromancy from fire, hydromancy from water, and chaomancy"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"from the air, their basis lies not in the particular element but in the innate divinatory capacity of man. And just as God has worked through many kinds of people, both humble and important, letting His son wander the earth as a humble man, who chose humble people as His apostles, and humble people have been prophets, so great miracles can happen through such humbleness and so can such people be prophets in geomancy, pyromancy, hydromancy, and chaomancy. It depends on whether the man has this divinatory nature. A practitioner of the uncertain arts must choose the right moment. Know the varieties of the uncertain arts: a gcomancer works with chalk, dice, wishes, and questions; pyromancy is practised by specu ­ lations in the fire; the portents of water consist in waves, foam, and bubbles; the verdict of air in the direction of the wind, whether it be straight or turbulent. Explanation o f Medicina Adepta : (this comprises two species). Adept medicine is that medicine which derives from the heavens. There are two kinds of medicine and two kinds of disease: one heavenly and the other elemental. Whoever under ­ stands heavenly disease and its medicine can practise adept medicine. Two species can be distinguished in this member: stellar physics and stellar surgery. Physics assumes that noth ­ ing is without disease and the stars themselves are not healthy. And because these things are our nourishment, we become like them. One should understand stellar surgery in a similar way. A star can wound, just as swords do, not in the form of cuts but in openings on the body in accordance with the heavenly sword. The appropriate medicine must be applied to these dis­ eases, for in these cases elemental medicine will be of no avail. Remedies originate and grow in the stars just as they do in the earth, but there is a difference. The medicine of the elements has a tangible body in which its virtue lies; the medicine of heaven has no body, but is alone, independent, separate, and purified, its needs no alchemist to separate the pure from the impure, or to extract the quintessence from the four elements. It is a medicine which requires no additives or cooking but can be directly administered to the patient. Whoever under ­ stands the diseases which come from heaven and knows how __________ ASTRONOMIA MAGNA (1537-8) __________ 131"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"to cure them with heavenly medicine is called medicus adeptus. That is intelligent medicine and the basis of half its province. For the heavens are connected with the body in such a way that infection can travel from the invisible realm to the visible, but the visible has no effect on the invisible. Explanation of Philosophic! Adepta: (this comprises two species). All earthly bodies carry a heavenly virtue in addition to that which they have from the elements. The adept philosopher can discern the heavenly virtue in an earthly body. Just as a com ­ mon philosopher can describe the natural virtues of the herbs, so can an adept philosopher describe their heavenly virtues. This cannot be determined by means of alchemy, which is effec ­ tive in the elemental case. For whatever the alchemist breaks down loses its heavenly virtue. If the heavenly virtue is to be effective, no decomposition must occur. Know furthermore that adept philosophy is cognizant of a special art of composition. Just as one can mix many kinds of bodies, so can the sidereal arcana be combined. This is how the names tyriaca coelestis, methridatum Olytnpi and suffuff aethereum are derived. Just as they are physically made, so they can be combined in a heavenly fashion. Note that such heavenly virtues produce knives and swords which can hew an anvil in two and cut through any metal as if it were wax; this art is called gladiclis or incusiva. Just as the elemental art makes knives to cut wood, so the astral art makes knives to cut metal. Know also that just as Nature makes natural keys to open locks, adept philosophy makes invisible keys. For whatever the elements can achieve in their realm through bodies, the star can do in its own essence. That is philosophic autoritatis and also portiva , because it is conveyed in an elemental body. As you can see, wounds can be healed naturally by elemental medicine, so you should know that heal ­ ing can occur astrally, and every disease can be healed thus as through elemental virtues. This is how one should understand the sciences of vulmrari and sanaria in the heavens. Note also that philosophic adepta is more than doctrine and science. You can understand this so: just as a pupil learns from his school ­ master, so man must learn adept philosophy from the heavenly preceptors. Scholarship is the species doctrinata, art is the species 132 ___________________ PARACELSUS ___________________"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"scicntena. Whatever one man can learn from another, he can learn more thoroughly and with more understanding from the stars. Thus is the species of sapiaitcna to be understood. It is also pos ­ sible to discover new arts through adept philosophy and this is the species inventuata, also in the stars. One must take them wherever they are. Thus inventions come forth, and this is the right way to make man perfect in the light of Nature. Explanation of Mathanatica Adept a : (this comprises eight spe ­ cies). The eight members described so far cannot be effected without instruments; mathematics is the art which teaches how to make such instruments. Thus there are mathematics cor ­ responding to magic, nigromancy, nectromancy, astrology, sig ­ natures, uncertain arts, adept medicine, and adept philosophy. Firstly, there are three species by means of which the instru ­ ments arc prepared. One is geometry and that has six parts: a geometry lor measuring the earth and making an instrument out ol it; a geometry ot the heavens for counterfeiting the heavens onto another body, just as an artist counterfeits a thing with colours. Geometry teaches everything about what is flat, smooth, hollow, near, or distant. Likewise with cosmography, which has two particular species, one heavenly and the other elemental, by means of which one can establish how and what anything is. So that if a herb or a bird is seen, one knows how and what it is. One must also know the cosmography of the elements and the stars . . . There is also a cosmography ccmcor- diae , which teaches how to harmonize both kinds of cosmog ­ raphy, each herb in its star, each star in its herb. And then there is a cosmography peregrina, which teaches how to recognize mohilia. This is how the mathematics of cosmography should be understood. There is also a mathematics of algorithms, which does not only teach how to compute the forms and bodies and figures, but that the art of arithmetic in all its virtues, number, line, and measure can be used in both cosmographies and geo ­ metries. Also that the mathematics circuli with all its species derive Irom the circle. Know accordingly that universal mathe ­ matics is the first beginning of the other eight members, and the more thoroughly it is understood, the more effective are the other eight members. __________ ASTRONOMIA MAGNA (1537-8) __________ 133"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Know now that the nine members and their species have been sufficiently explained, and that these nine members, nine arts, nine sciences can be practised outside the elemental realm and just as naturally as the elemental art. Just as a craftsman com ­ pletes his task in a physical fasion, so can things occur in a spiritual fashion. Just as one can say that smithery and other crafts are natural arts and are performed and understood natur ­ ally, so the members of astronomy are practised naturally. Just as one can say that man is a natural body, so there arc natural spirits. Whatever is done by flesh and blood, is done natur ­ ally; and likewise, whatever the spirit docs, it does naturally. Every body completes the task for which it was created. There is one operation in flesh and blood, another in the spirit. What flesh and blood do is natural; what the spirit does is also natural, what the elements do is natural, what the star does is natural. Elements behave as elements, the heavens as heavens. Whoever is experienced and learned in the elements can philosophize elementally. Whoever is learned in the heavens can philosophize in a heavenly fashion. I. xii. 75-101 134 ___________________ PARACELSUS _ __________________ 9.24 These nine members of astronomy are all arts, which is to say that they can only be practised by men. Thus there is a human science of magic, one of nigromancy, and one for all the others. Now take note that there are ten more members of astronomy which are not human arts but ethereal arts. That is, the heavens themselves arc an astronomer and can practise without the aid of man. Man can see what the heavens have achieved on their own. It is easy to understand these ten members and their spe ­ cies in the special figure shown here. Thus one can understand the capacities of man in the three foregoing figures and the capacities of the heavens in the following figure:"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Impressio: 4. Inclinatio: 3.

There are two ways in which one can know the future: firstly by natural means, through prognostications and the ver ­ dicts of astronomy; secondly by supernatural means as in prophecies and vaticinations. Divination is the member which describes the supernatural means of foretelling the future and as such occurs through six processes: dreams, fantasies, specu ­ lations, the mood, reflection, and the voice. In order that you may understand divination more easily, I shall give several examples. For the most part divinations appear to man in such an unimpressive form that they are ignored. And yet Joseph discovered in his sleep who Mary was and by whom she was with child. And because dreams are not sufficiently heeded, no faith is put in their revelations, although they are in fact divi­ nations. Future events can also be revealed by fantasies in the form of pictures or images. One may encounter strange figures in heaven or spirits. These arc all species of divination, but because no one knows whence they come they are mocked. In the case of speculation one thinks how matters may turn out, and if it does so happen, but there is no other reason to account for it, this too will not be believed. Something may be evident in one ’ s mood and in the end it happens. One may frequently think and reflect on something and then it finally happens. Also one may speak of a thing and it happens. But because there are no reasons for the occurrence, the prophe ­ cies of divination are scorned — and they also frequently hap ­ pen through simple and modest people and they too are scorned. So divination is a work that comes from heaven above in the six species indicated, and one should take note of it and not scorn. For a wise man does not scorn them but considers them with wisdom. Augurium and its species: this also has a supernatural origin and is but the presage of future things. There are six species of augu ­ ries, and although they appear ridiculous, the wise man must not scorn them, but recall that Christ appeared in a humble form and was ridiculed. If he understands that inconspicuous things must not be ridiculed but judged with wisdom, he will also be given the understanding to know Christ. The scorners 136 ___________________ PARACELSUS ___________________"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"have no understanding, but the wise possess the understand ­ ing that God has conferred upon them. The supreme mover gives auguries through particular indications, like the birds, for example, and the wise man can discern that these indications concern men. Thus are plague, war, and murder often presaged. The animals can also feel something unusual which is a pres- sage lor man. One can see auguries in the movements of fish in the water, also in worms, wooden figures, and stones. Mon ­ sters are frequently born of birds, beasts, fish, worms, and even men, and these are a presage of a future calamity that will come upon man. Ebriecatum and its species: this member refers to when a man loses his normal reason and acquires an alien reason. For there are two kinds of reason: human reason and alien reason. God gives man human reason, in order that he can conduct his life properly, recognize, measure, and understand things. But with alien reason a man cannot understand things properly, but flies to and fro like a reed in the water. This alien reason is a spirit of giddiness which makes everything mad and confusing. Con ­ sider this example of the differences between the two types of reason. A man might live blamelessly according to human rea ­ son. But if he was full of wine and drunk, so the human rea ­ son would decrease and the alien reason increase. A drunken man does not act out of human reason but is mad, incompre ­ hensible, coarse, and capricious. Now within this member there are five species, by means of which a man may enter a state of alien reason as if he were drunk. For there are such wines in the heavens, and whoever drinks of them falls into the alien, mad, and incomprehensible reason. One species is called ebriecata mania or inebriata mania , and in this state men read out words and interpret them irrationally. There is inebriata phrenesis, and in this state men want to fight out everything with swords. There is inebriata phantasmata , an alien reason which has its own strange customs and gestures. There is also a species called imaginatio inebriata , in which one thinks that the walls are talk ­ ing, that one ’ s bed is going round in circles, and one does not know oneself. The fifth species is immutatio, when ideas and thoughts are all reversed, friend and foe confused. There might __________ ASTRONOMIA MAGNA (1537-8) __________ 137"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"be a hundred such persons gathered together, and they would all think differently and have their own ideas. bidinatio and its species: this fourth member concerns the stars ’ government and influence over man. A star undertakes a thing and wants a man to manifest it. But because no man stands in a conjunction with the star, the star must choose a man like an adoptive son. This inclination occurs in six different ways. It can happen through the body, making a particularly pleasant person, who is also commendable or malignant to other men; Solomon was such an adoptive son with respect to the per ­ son. It can happen through the mood, so that a man can sur ­ pass all others in mood; Julius Caesar was such an adoptive son with respect to the mood. There are inclinations which can extol the spirit, which then surpasses other spirits in good for­ tune, and Emperor Barbarossa was such an adoptive son. The stars can also manifest a doctrine through men, and Albertus Magnus, Lactantius, and Wycliffe were such adoptive sons. The stars can prepare a particular art or business ability, and such adoptive sons were Albertus Diirer of Nuremberg and Fug- ger ol Augsburg. In the sixth species the stars confer a dex ­ terity in which persons surpass all others, and the adoptive sons in this case are those who can walk the tightrope. Thus the fourth member and its species relate to the heavenly motions ’ effects on their adoptive sons. That is inclination. Iniprcssio and its species: impression is a virtue which comes from the stars and only serves in the elemental body, having nothing in common with the astral body. Just as colours and a body belong together, so the impression and the elemental body cannot be separated. Impression begins with conception, is embodied and grows up with the body. Just as the body has colours, which change over time, as black, red, or blond hair becomes grey or white, so the impression is received by man in the elemental body, ages, and is transformed. Now the impression of the elemental body is the spiraculum vitae [breath of life], without which there is no life in the body. The breath of life has two inspirations: God who gives man life, and the innate essence of life. But there is a further inspirator which 138 ___________________ PARACELSUS ___________________"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"works together with these. . . Impression is nothing but the permanent inspiration, received at conception and birth, and from this impression follow health or disease, delightful man ­ ners, gestures, works, wisdom, and consideration. Geiwratio and its species: this member has four species cor ­ responding to each of the four elements. Generation is noth ­ ing but the communication which the stars impart to man. The Sun gives warmth to the elements, without it they would all be dead. The Sun is the breath of life to the elements. Now the elements are matrices, the heavens parents; the two give birth to all fruits which grow from the elements, and the Sun is their breath of life. Generation means that the elements can do nothing without the stars, for the elements are matrices, Vul ­ can is the Sun, Nature is the fabricator. The seeds lie in the matrix and not in the creator, just as the egg is in the hen and not the cock. But if a chick is to be hatched, that must happen through the cock. Thus the matrices have the seed, but the effec ­ tive power comes from the stars. Concerning generation you should know that all minerals, salts, metals, gems, stones, and rocks grow from the element Water; Water is their mother and the Sun hatches them in the water. The Sun cooks and incu ­ bates the fruits of the element Fire, which arc all the meteoric impressions: rain, snow, wind, thunder, and hail. All the fruits of the element Earth — wood, herbs, grass, sponges, flowers, and other things — arc incubated by the Sun and receive their appropriate nourishment from the stars and the earth. The same is also true of the fruits of the air like tcreniabin and manna. Iuatiimatum and its species: this member is harder to understand than the others. Inanimatum is a man who has no soul, and there are six varieties: nymphs (water creatures), giants, lemurs (mountain creatures), gnomes (air creatures), vulcans (fire crea ­ tures), and pygmies or scrats. For just as we men arc born on earth with souls, there are those without a soul in each of the four elements and two more besides, the giants and the pyg ­ mies. For just as we walk upon the earth but not in it, pass over the water but not in it, across fire and not in it, across the air and not in it, there arc men counterfeited in the ele ­ ments which dwell in them rather than over or upon them, __________ ASTRONOMIA MAGNA (1537-8) __________ 139"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"like the phoenix in the fire, the talpa in the earth. . . These beings arc born of heavenly and elemental seeds and not made from the limns terrae. These are not creatures but [beings spon ­ taneously generated] like the horse-flies from horse-dung. Meteorica and their species: this member has many kinds of spe­ cies and is really the sagax meteorica , not the meteorica minor. So that you may understand the differences between these two kinds of meteorica , you should know that the meteorica minor relates to the member of generation, while the manifestations of meteorica sagax arc born in the sublime Olympus-like rain in the form of a mist, which is spiritual rather than physical. They also cause thunder and lightning, which docs not strike the earth but causes globules and stones to fall. The sagax meteorica also gives birth to blood, metals, dragons, haloes, appa ­ ritions, mirages, figures, and such like. Aegrorum and its species: the heavens work in many ways. If a tree is cut down at an unpropitious time, the heavens have a power over this tree, and all the aspects and conjunctions of the heavens can be discerned in its wood like the parts of a clock. Similarly, a piece of clay dug up under a particular con ­ stellation produces crickets which relate to that constellation, for they change with the Moon ... If a man falls sick under such a heavenly power, the astrologer can predict its coming. He can tell more than the crickets in the clay, maggots in the cheese, worms in the wood, and these men are born prophets through their diseases. The species ot foretelling concern the weather, whether it is colder or warmer, light or heavy, long or short, when the Moon is new or old, and so on. Nature gives us to understand things through the elemental bodies in the heavens. Thus you can also know the future of the winds, the improvement of the climate. This is the ninth member of the astral sciences. Novalia and their species: God has ordered how everything should give birth to another, and it pleased God that all things were good. However, it can happen that this order is broken and that deformities appear, but these are only errors of Nature. But it is recognized that the astral nature can cause such things. 140 ___________________ PARACELSUS ___________________"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"For example, a hundred men may be given a task, that each should make an image. No single one is like another, but only the one who can do it well produces a good picture; the other ninety-nine produce nothing good. Likewise Nature practises her art in making man and other living beings, but because there arc so many things which make up a man, it is possible that one comes along with its pattern and spoils the work. It is like a council chamber full of folk and each wants his coun ­ sel to be followed; the final decision is foolish and cretinous. Understand thus the nature and property of the stars, that they do not act in unison and can produce a mixed result in mind and body, not just in mankind but among the birds, the beasts, the fish, the plants, and the trees contrary to their nature. The naturalist should beware of these monstrous forms because they have a monstrous sense as in madmen, mistletoe, and mould. And where there are such monstrous bodies in Nature, one should seek the monstrous remedies. But these should not be used in the normal body, for imperfect bodies give imperfect medicaments. This is the tenth member of astral science and simply comprises the heavenly influence which transfigures elemental bodies into a perverse and contrary form. I. xii. 101-17 [The remainder of the Philosophic! Sagax, a substantial work con ­ sisting of four books, extends the discussion of astronomy according to the framework of nine human members and ten heavenly (ethereal) members in all its ramifications. The remain­ ing chapters 6-11 of the first book deal with probations (ex ­ periments) in the nine members of magic, nigromancy, nectromancy, astrology, signatures, uncertain arts, adept medi ­ cine, adept philosophy, and adept mathematics, and with the ten divine gifts of divination, auguries, ebriccatum , inclination, impression, generation, inanimation, meteorica, aegrorum , and nova- lia. However, this first book covers only the first of the four categories of astronomy: natural astronomy. The second book is devoted to the second category, heavenly astronomy, and dis­ cusses such matters as the origins of the soul, the mortal and eternal bodies of man, and the relationship of God with man, together with an analogous exposition of the nine members __________ ASTRONOMIA MAGNA (1537-8) __________ 141"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"ot astronomy and their species, the ten heavenly members, the experiments in the nine members, and the corresponding experiments in the divine gifts, all in the context of heavenly astronomy. This second book comprises nine chapters, the last of which is lost. The third book was devoted to the third category of astronomy, the Olympi Novi , but no part of it has survived. The fourth book is devoted to the fourth category of astronomy, infernal astronomy, and comprises thirteen chap­ ters. These deal with the nature of hell; the infernal spirits; the alliance of evil spirits with God, the angels, the Saints, and men; the alliance of the dead with demons, and lastly, an outline of infernal astronomy in the nine members. The complete work thus presents a comprehensive account of what Paracelsus called astronomy, effectively a pansophy of heaven and earth, in a for ­ mal structure of categories and encyclopaedic detail.] 9.25 Human nature is different from all other animal nature. It is endowed with divine wisdom, endowed with divine arts. Therefore we are justly called gods and the sons of the All Highest. For the light of Nature is in us and this light is God. Our mortal bodies are vehicles of the divine wisdom. We also have in our power arts that we owe to no one but God, and they are given to us in the hour of our conception . . . For this reason there are no grounds for the question: who can know the future? Man docs not know, only God knows. But as God created the art, so the art knows. Who taught the prophets how to speak? God alone. Who taught the arts? God alone also. But how can things be impossible for the art, but possible for God? Therefore, study without respite, so that the art may become perfect in us. 1. xii. 120-1 142 ___________________ PARACELSUS ___________________ 9.26 Magic transfers celestial forces to the medium in which such forces can operate.

The magus learns only from the stars and not from man . . . Art is born with man, art and man arc conceived together. . . The magus is not born of the natural stars but of the supernatural stars. Magic is impressed on the magus as is vision on the eyes and hearing on the ears —take the example of the magi of the past, none of whom was taught the book ­ learning of mortal man. For if a man goes to no other school but that which is made of bricks and mortar and seeks no other schoolmaster than one behind the stove, he will come to nothing except superficially. But the school of magic stands its test through Christ, who says ‘ Learn from me, for I am merciful and of a humble heart. ’ I. xii. 122-4 __________ ASTRONOMIA MAGNA (1537-8) __________ 143 9.27 The natural form of a tree is utterly familiar, but any plane can reduce it, so that the tree can no longer be recognized, and yet it is still the original wood. Cannot a sculptor also transform the original shape, while it remains the same material? Like­ wise a painter. If Nature is able to achieve this through the coarse and clumsy elemental body, how much more can she achieve through the spiritual body, which is as subtle as sunshine? If the elemental body can make another form out of wood, the spiritual body can make from stone or wood another figure or form, which would astonish the elemental body. For the elemental body draws the art out of the spiritual body, but only receives the lesser values. The Master is superior to his disci ­ ples. Thus is follows that the Master of the Spirit can trans ­ form man just as a painter can change the figures in his picture. It is human scientia and not the stars which enable this, although the magus learns from the stars and is himself proficient.

For if Nature is willing on her own account to endow herbs and stones with magical virtues, how much more can be achieved when she is induced to do so? For stones, herbs, and suchlike cannot be found in all places. Where does one find enough magnets? Or enough sapphires? When does one find everything in the leas and meadows? This lack com ­ pels the use of magic. Thus, Nature will put into words, gama ­ heu , and images virtues like those which inhere in herbs and roots. . . Cabbala also uses such magical forces. . . whatever the elemental body can achieve, the spiritual body can far sur ­ pass it by means of cabbalism . . . One should not be astonished by this, for the Scriptures say ‘ Ye arc Gods ’ ; we are much more like stars, only more powerful than them.

I. xii. 130 9.30 A physician understands and knows all the virtues in the herbs. In the same way the magus understands what is in the stars, and nothing remains concealed in the heavens, which astronomy is able to interpret by means of its species. Now, the physician extracts the virtue from the herbs and calls this a remedy. The extract may have little weight, but it has many leas and meadows in its fist. But the extract alone is the remedy, not the leas and the meadows. Thus the magus can transfer many meadows of heaven into a small pebble which we call gamaheu, imago, or character. For these are boxes in which the magus keeps side­ real forces and virtues. Just as the physician can give his remedy to a patient and cure his disease, so the magus can transfer such virtues to man, after he has extracted them from the stars.

For on one can be blessed after death unless they have been chosen to lead a blessed life on earth. If man must first be on earth, that which he wishes to be after death, he must strive towards it and think how he can attain this on earth.

Birth is man ’ s spring, when buds grow on his branches. Then come the shoots, then the blossoms, and finally the fruits. Should, then, the fruit of man — that is, his gift — be cut off when it is still a bud or a shoot? Man thinks, to be sure, that he is something, and because he bears more fruit than a nut tree, he thinks that there will always be more fruit in him.

Before the flower is full-grown, no one should break forth with their wisdom, reason, and thoughts. For even the snakes arc cautious and do not hatch before their time. It is God who makes you fly, with or without wings; He lets you imagine, think, judge. And when you think that you have flown as far as the third heaven, you have not even lifted yourself above the grass in the field and you are no use.

The worries of interest payments and securities are the work of the master . . . And as can be observed in any craft, masters have special gifts which servants do not possess ... A master should work on a task where he is more productive than his servant; whenever this is not the case, he should let the ser ­ vant do the work . . . Therefore he should leave the common work to his servant and work on the subtle tasks. For there is no craft on earth which docs not have its advanced problems.

In one place there is abundance, in another poverty. Now love demands an order so that one part helps the other to bear its cross . . . The same applies to the crafts . . . Each has his special gift, art, wisdom, righteousness. Whoever is more and a superior, he is a yet greater servant and he should be all the more subordinate without any envy and disloyalty. No one should think otherwise than: if my neighbour had more than I, a good order would result. Thus agriculture is the first order, for whoever is affected by hail is in the same position as he who is not affected. This applies to wine, corn, oats, hay, poultry, cattle; each part can benefit from the other, if they need to.

For putrefaction is the highest grade, and the first initiative to generation. But putrefaction originates from a moist heat. For a constant moist heat produces putrefaction and transmutes all natural things from their first form and essence, as well as their force and virtue, into something else. For as putrefaction in the bowels transmutes and reduces all foods into dung, so, also, without the belly, putrefaction in glass transmutes all things from one form to another, from one essence to another, from one colour to another, from one odour to another, from one virtue to another, from one force to another, from one set of properties to another, and, in a word, from one quality to another. For it is known and proved by daily experience that many good things which are healthful and a medicine, become, after their putrefaction, bad, unwhole ­ some, and mere poison. So, on the other hand, many things are bad, unwholesome, poisonous, and hurtful, which after their"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"174 PARACELSUS putrefaction become good, lose all their evil effect, and make noble medicines. For putrefaction brings forth great effects, as we have a good example in the sacred gospel, where Christ says, 'Unless a grain of wheat be cast forth into a field and putrefy, it cannot bear fruit a hundred fold. ’ Hence it may be known that many things are multiplied by putrefaction so that they produce excellent fruit. For putrefaction is the change and death of all things, and the destruction of the first essence of all natural objects, from whence there issues forth for us regeneration and a new birth ten thousand times better than before. Since, then, putrefaction is the first step and commencement of generation, it is in the highest degree necessary that we should thoroughly understand this process. But there arc many kinds of putrefaction, and one produces its generation better than another, one more quickly than another. We have also said that what is moist and warm constitutes the first grade and the beginning of putrefaction, which procreates all things as a hen procreates her eggs. Wherefore by and in putrefaction everything becomes mucilaginous phlegm and living matter, whatever it eventually turns out to be. You see an example in eggs, wherein is mucilaginous moisture, which by continuous heat putrefies and is quickened into the living chicken, not only by the heat which comes from the hen, but by any similar heat. For by such a degree of heat eggs can be brought to maturity in glass, and by the heat of ashes, so that they become living birds. Any man, too, can bring the egg to maturity under his own arm and procreate the chicken as well as the hen. And here something more is to be noticed. If the living bird be burned to dust and ashes in a sealed cucurbite with the third degree of fire, and then, still shut up, be putrefied with the highest degree of putrefaction in a venter equinus so as to become a mucilaginous phlegm, then that phlegm can again be brought to maturity, and so, renovated and restored, can become a liv ­ ing bird, provided the phlegm be once more enclosed in its jar or receptacle. This is to revive the dead by regeneration and clarification, which is indeed a great and profound miracle of Nature.

For you must know that in this way men can be generated without natural father and mother; that is to say, not in the natural way from the woman, but by the art and industry of a skilled Spagyrist a man can be bom and grow, as will hereafter be described. I. xi. 312-13 ____________ DE NATURA RERUM (1537) _____________ 175 14.2 But neither must we by any means forget the generation of homunculi. For there is some truth in this thing, although for a long time it was held in a most occult manner and with secrecy, while there was no little doubt and question among some of the old Philosophers, whether it was possible to Nature and Art, that a man should be begotten without the female body and the natural womb. I answer hereto, that this is in no way opposed to Spagyric Art and to Nature, nay, that it is perfectly possible. In order to accomplish it, you must proceed thus. Let the semen of a man putrefy by itself in a sealed cucurbite with the highest putrefaction of the venter equinus for forty days, or until it begins at last to live, move, and be agitated, which can easily be seen. After this time it will be in some degree like a human being, but, nevertheless, transparent and without body. If now, after this, it be every day nourished and fed cautiously and prudently with the arcanum of human blood, and kept for forty weeks in the perpetual and equal heat of a venter equinus , it becomes, thenceforth, a true and and living infant, having all the members of a child that is born from a woman, but much smaller. This we call a homunculus; and it should be afterwards educated with the greatest care and zeal, until it grows up and begins to display intelligence. Now, this is one of the greatest secrets which God has revealed to mortal and fallible man. It is a miracle and marvel of God, an arcanum above all arcana, and deserves to be kept secret until the last times, when there shall be nothing hidden, but all things shall be made manifest.

Know, then, that all the seven metals are born from a threefold matter, namely, Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt, but with distinct and peculiar colourings. In this way, Hermes truly said that all the seven metals were made and compounded of three substances, and in like manner also tinctures and the Philoso ­ phers ’ Stone. These three substances he names Spirit, Soul, and Body. But he did not point out how this was to be understood, or what he meant by it, though possibly he might also have known the three principles, but he makes no mention of them. I do not therefore say that he was in error, but that he was silent. Now, in order that these three distinct substances may be rightly understood, namely, spirit, soul, and body, it should be known that they signify nothing else than the three principles, Mer ­ cury, Sulphur, and Salt, from which all the seven metals are generated. For Mercury is the spirit, Sulphur is the soul, and Salt is the body. The metal between the spirit and the body, concerning which Hermes speaks, is the soul, which indeed is Sulphur. It unites those two contraries, the body and the spirit, and changes them into one essence. But it must not be under ­ stood that from any Mercury, and any Sulphur, and any Salt, these seven metals can be generated, or, in like manner, the Tinc ­ ture or the Philosophers ’ Stone by the Art and the industry of the Alchemist in the fire; but all these seven metals must be generated in the mountains by the Archeus of the earth. The alchemist will more easily transmute metals than generate or make them. Nevertheless, live Mercury is the mother of all the seven metals, and deserves to be called the Mother of Metals.

None can deny that the earth is rendered fruitful by the rain, and all must confess that every kind of fruit is ripened by the sun. Since, then, by the Divine institution, this is possible to Nature, who will deny or refuse to believe that man possesses this same power by a prudent and skilful pursuit of the Alchemical Art, so that he shall render the fruitless fruitful, the unripe ripe, and make all increase and grow? The Scripture says that God sub ­ jected all created things to man, and handed them over to him as if they were his own property, so that he might use them for his necessity, that he might have dominion over the fishes of the sea, the fowls of the air, and everything on the earth without exception. Wherefore man ought to rejoice because God has illuminated him and endowed him, so that all God ’ s creatures are compelled to obey Him and to be subject to Him, especially all the earth, together with all things which are born, live, and move in it and upon it. Since, then, we see with our eyes, and are taught by daily experience, that the oftener and the more plentifully the rain moistens the earth, and the sun dries it again with its heat and glow, the sooner the fruits of the earth come forth and ripen, while all fruits increase and grow, whatever be the time of year, let none wonder that the alchemist, too, by manifold imbibitions and distillations, can produce the same effect. For what is rain but the imbibition of the earth? What are the heat and glow of the sun other than the sun ’ s process of distillation, which again extracts the humid ­ ity? Wherefore I say that it is possible by such co-optation in the middle of winter to produce green herbs, flowers, and fruits, by means of earth and water, from seed and root. Now, if this takes place with herbs and flowers, it will take place in many other similar things too, as, for instance, in all minerals, the imperfect metals whereof can be ripened with mineral water by the industry and art of the skilled alchemist. So, too, can all marcasites, granites, zincs, arsenics, talcs, cachimiac, bismuths, antimonies, etc., all of which carry with them immature Sol and Luna, be so ripened as to be made equal to the richest veins of gold and silver, only by such co-optation.

Extract it again with the third degree of fire until nothing more ascends. Again pour over it distilled water, and once more extract by distillation as before. Do this until you see the Sol rise in the glass and grow in the form of a tree with many branches and leaves. Thus there is produced from Sol a wonderful and beautiful shrub which alchemists call the Golden Herb, or the Philosophers ’ Tree.

But as to what and of what kind the life of each particular thing is, it should be known that the life of things is none other than a spiritual essence, an invisible and impalpable thing, a spirit and a spiritual thing. On this account there is nothing corporeal but has latent within itself a spirit and life, which, as just now said, is none other than a spiritual thing. But not only that lives which moves and acts, as men, animals, worms in the earth, birds under the sky, fishes in the sea, but also all corporeal and substantial things. For here we should know that God, at the beginning of the creation of all things, created no body whatever without its own spirit, W'hich spirit it contains after an occult manner within itself. For what is the body without the spirit?"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"L)E NATURA RERUM (1537) ____________ 179 Absolutely nothing. So it is that the spirit holds concealed within itself the virtue and power of the thing, and not the body. For in the body is death, and the body is subject to death, and in the body nothing but death must be looked for. For the body can be destroyed and corrupted in various ways, but not the spirit: for it always remains a living spirit, and is bound up with life. It also keeps its own body alive, but in the removal of the body from it, it leaves the body separate and dead, and returns to its own place whence it had come, that is to say, into chaos, and into the air of the higher and lower firmament. Hence it is evident that there are different kinds of spirits, just as there are different kinds of bodies. There are celestial and infernal spirits, human and metallic, the spirits of salts, gems, and mar- casites, arsenical spirits, spirits of potables, of roots, of liquids, of flesh, blood, bones, etc. Wherefore you may know that the spirit is in very truth the life and balsam of all corporeal things. Now we will go on to its species, and here will describe to you in detail, but as briefly as possible, the life of each natural thing. The life, then, of all men is none other than a certain astral balsam, a balsamic impression, a celestial and invisible fire, an included air, and a spirit of salt which tinges. I am unable to name it more clearly, although it could be put forward under many distinctive titles. Since, however, the chief and the best are here pointed out, we will be silent as to the rest and the inferior names. The life of metals is a latent fatness which they have received from Sulphur. This is shown from their fluxion, because every ­ thing which passes into flux in the fire does so on account of its hidden fatness. Unless this were so no metal could be reduced to a fluid state, as we sec in the case of iron and steel, which have the least Sulphur and fatness of all the metals, wherefore they arc of a drier nature than all the rest of them. The life of Mercury is nothing but inner heat and outer fri ­ gidity. That is to say, within it gives heat, but without it causes cold; and in this respect it is aptly to be compared to a gar ­ ment of skins, which, like Mercury, causes both heat and cold. For if a garment of this kind be worn by a man, it warms him and protects him from the cold; but if he wears the hairless"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"part against his naked body, it causes cold, and defends him from excessive heat. So it came about that in very ancient times, and it is even the custom still, that these coats of skin arc worn both in summer and in winter, as much against the heat as against the cold; in summer the hairless part is turned within, and the hairy part outside, but in the cold winter season the hairy part is turned within and the hairless part outside. As it is with the garment of skins, so is it with Mercury. I. xi. 329-331 iso ____________________ PARACELSUS _____________________ 14.7 The life of Sulphur is a combustible, ill-smelling fatness. Whilst it flames and sends forth its evil odour it may be said to live. The life of all salts is nothing else but a spirit of aqua fortis: for when the water is abstracted from them, that which remains at the bottom is called dead earth. The life of gems and corals is mere colour, which can be taken from them by spirits of wine. The life of pearls is their bright ­ ness, which they lose in their calcination. The life of the mag ­ net is the spirit of iron, which can be extracted and taken away by rectified vinum aniens itself, or by spirit of wine. The life of flints is a mucilaginous matter. The life of mar- casites, cachymiac, talc, cobalt, zinc, granites, zwitter, vismat [rude tin], is a metallic spirit of antimony, which has the power to tinge. Of arscnicals, auripigment, orpiment, realgar, and simi ­ lar matters, the life is a mineral coagulated poison. The life of wavelike substances, that is to say, of the dung of men and animals, is their strong and foetid smell. When this is lost they are dead. The life of aromatic substances, to wit, musk, ambergris, civet, and whatever emits a strong, sweet, and pleasant odour, is nothing but that grateful odour itself. If they lose this they are dead and useless. The life of sweet things, as sugar, honey, manna, fistula cas- siae, and the like, is a subtle sweetness, with the power to tinge; for if that sweetness be taken away by distillation, or sublima ­ tion, the things arc dead, fatuous, and no longer of any value. The life of resins, as caraba, turpentine, and gum, is a muci ­"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"laginous, glittering fatness. They all give excellent varnish; when they no longer furnish this, and lose their glitter, they are dead. The life of herbs, roots, apples, and other fruits of this kind, is nothing else than the liquid of the earth, which they spon ­ taneously lose if they arc deprived of water and earth. The life of wood is a certain resin. Any wood that is deprived of resin is unable longer to flourish. The life of bones is the liquid of mumia. The life of flesh and blood is none other than the spirit of Salt, which preserves them from ill odour and decay, and spontaneously, as the water is separated from them. But concerning the life of the elements there is this to be known. The life of water is its flowing. When it is coagulated by the cold of the firmament and congealed into ice, then it is dead, and all power of doing harm is taken from it, since no one can any longer be drowned in it. So, too, the life of fire is air, for the air makes the fire blaze more strongly and with greater impetuosity. Some air proceeds from all fire, sufficient to extinguish a candle or to lift a light feather, as is evident to the eyes. All live fire, therefore, if it be shut up or deprived of the power to send forth its air, must be suffocated. The air lives of itself, and gives life to all other things. The earth, however, is of itself dead; but its own element is its invisi ­ ble and occult life. I. xi. 331-2 ____________ DE NATURA RERUM (1537) _____________ 181 14.8 BOOK V CONCERNING THE DEATH OF NATURAL THINGS The death of all natural things is nothing else but an alteration and removal of their powers and virtues, an overthrow of their potencies for evil or for good, an overwhelming and blotting out of their former nature, and the generation of a new and diflerent nature. For it should be known that many tilings which in life were good, and had their own virtues, retain little or none of that virtue when they are dead, but appear altogether"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"fatuous and powerless. So, on the other hand, many things in their life are evil, but in death, or after they have been morti ­ fied, they display a manifold power and efficacy, and do much good. We could recount many examples of this, but that is altogether foreign to our purpose. Yet, in order that you may see that I do not write from my mere opinion, however plau ­ sible, but from my experience, it is well that I should adduce one example with which I will quiet and silence the sophists who say that nothing can be gained from dead things, nor any­ thing ought to be sought or found in them. The cause of this assertion is that they value at nothing the preparations of the alchemists, by which many great secrets of this kind are dis­ covered. For look at Mercury, live and crude Sulphur, and crude antimony; as they are brought from the mines, that is, while they are still living, how small is their virtue, how lightly and tardily do they exercise their influence. Indeed, they bring more evil than good, and are rather a poison than a medicine. But if, by the industry of a skilled alchemist, they are corrupted into their first substance and prudently prepared (that is, if the Mercury be coagulated, precipitated, sublimated, resolved, and turned into oil; the Sulphur be sublimated, calcined, reverber ­ ated and turned into oil; and, in like manner, Venus be subli ­ mated, calcined, reverberated, and turned into oil), you see what usefulness, what power and virtue, and what rapid efficiency they afford and display, so that none can fully speak or write of it. For their manifold virtues are not to be investigated, nor can anyone search them out. Every alchemist, therefore, and every faithful physician, ought to seek into these three things during his whole life, and even up to his death should play with them and find his pastime in them. Most assuredly they will nobly compensate him for all his labour, study, and expense.

Therefore, at this point, the most careful observation is necessary, since death is twofold, that is to say, violent or spontaneous. From the one, a thing can be resuscitated, but not from the other. Do not. then, believe the sophists when they tell you that a thing once dead or mortified cannot be resuscitated, and when they make light of resuscitation and restoration; for their mistake is great. It is indeed true that whatever perishes by its own natural death, or whatever mor ­ tifies by Nature according to its own predestination, God alone can resuscitate, or that it must be done by His divine command. So whatever Nature consumes man cannot restore. But whatever man destroys man can restore, and break again when restored. Beyond this man by his condition has no power, and if anyone strove to do more he would be arrogating to himself the power of God, and yet would labour in vain and be con ­ founded, unless God were with him, or he had such faith that he could remove mountains. To such a man this, and still greater things, would be possible, since Scripture says, for Christ Him ­ self had said— ‘ If ye have faith as a grain of mustard-seed, and say to this mountain: Depart and place yourself yonder, it would do so and place itself there; and all things shall be possible, and nothing impossible, to you. ’ But let us return to our proposition. What is the difference between dying and being mortified, and from which of these conditions is resuscitation possible? The matter is to be under ­ stood thus. Whatever dies by its own nature has its end accord ­ ing to predestination, and as the pleasure and dispensation of God arranges. But this, too, happens from different diseases and accidents, and herefrom there is no resuscitation, nor is there any preservative which can be used against predestina ­ __________ DE NATURA RERUM (1537)"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"tion and the cognate end of life. But what is mortified can be resuscitated and revivified, as may be proved by many argu ­ ments which we will set down at the end of this book. So, then, there is the greatest difference between dying and mortifying, nor should it be thought that these are only two names for one thing. In very deed these differ as widely as possible. Examine the case of a man who has died by a natural and predestined death. What further good or use is there in him? None. Let him be cast to the worms. But the case is not the same with a man who has been slain with a sword or has died some vio ­ lent death. The whole of his body is useful and good, and can be fashioned into the most valuable mumia. For though the spirit of life has gone forth from such a body, still the balsam remains, in which life is latent, which also, indeed, as a balsam conserves other human bodies. So, too, in the instance of metals you see that when a metal has a tendency to die it begins to be affected with rust, and that which has been so affected is dead; and when the whole ol the metal is consumed with rust the whole is dead, and such rust can never be brought back to be a metal, but is mere ashes and no metal. It is dead, and death is in itself: nor has it any longer the balsam of life, but has perished in itself. I. xi. 343-4 184 ___________________ PARACELSUS ___________________ 14.10 BOOK IX CONCERNING THE SIGNATURE OF NATURAL THINGS In this book, our first business, as being about to philosophize, is with the signature of things, as, for instance, to set forth how they are signed, what signator exists, and how many signs are reckoned. Be it known, first of all, then, that signs are threefold. The first things signed man signs; the second Archeus signs; the third the stars of the supernaturals. In this way, then, only three signators exist, man, Archeus , and the stars. Moreover, it should be remarked that the signs signed by man carry with them perfect knowledge and judgement of occult things, as well as acquaintance with their powers and hidden faculties. The signs of the stars give prophecies and presages. They"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"point out the force of supernatural things, and put forth true judgements and disclosures in gcomancy, chiromancy, hydro- mancy, pyromancy, necromancy, astronomy, the Berillistic art, and other astral sciences. Now, in order that we may explain all the signs as correctly and as briefly as possible, it is above all else necessary that we put forward those whereof man is the signator. When these are understood you will more rightly attain to the others, whether natural or supernatural. For instance, it is known that Jews wear a yellow sign on their cloak or on their coat. What is this but a sign by which anybody who meets him may under ­ stand that he is a Jew? So, too, the lictor is known by his parti ­ coloured tunic or armlet. So, too, every magistracy decks its ministers with its own proper colours and adornments. The mechanic marks his work with its peculiar sign, so that everyone may understand who has produced it. For what pur ­ pose does the courier carry the insignia of his master or his city on his garment, except that it may be clear he is a mes ­ senger, that he serves one or another, that he comes from one place or another, and so thus procures for himself a safe passage? So, too, the soldier carries a sign or symbol, black, white, green, blue, or red, that he may be distinguished from the enemy. Hence it is known that one is on the side of Caesar, or of the kings; that one is an Italian, another a Gaul, etc. These are signs which relate to rank and office; and many more of them might be enumerated.

The wise man can dominate the stars, and is not sub- jet to them. Nay, the stars arc subject to the wise man, and are forced to obey him, not he the stars. The stars compel and coerce the animal man, so that where they lead he must follow, just as a thief does the gallows, a robber the wheel, a fisher the fishes, a fowler the birds, and a hunter the wild beasts. What other"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"PARACELSUS reason is there for this, save that man does not know or esti ­ mate himself or his own powers, or reflect that he is a lesser universe, and has the whole firmament with its powers hid ­ den within himself? Thus man is called animal and unwise and the slave of all earthly things, when, nevertheless, he received from God in Paradise the privilege of ruling over and dominat ­ ing all other creatures, and not of obeying them. So it was that God created man last, when all other things had been made before him. This right was afterwards lost by the Fall. Yet, the wisdom of man was not made servile, nor did he lose his free ­ dom. It is right, then, that the stars should follow him and obey him, not he the stars. . . In order to grasp these things it must be remembered that stars are of two kinds, terrestrial and celestial. The former belong to folly, the latter to wisdom. And as there are two worlds, the lesser and the larger, and the lesser rules the larger, so also the star of the microcosm governs and subdues the celestial star. God did not create the planets and stars with the inten ­ tion that they should dominate man, but that they, like other creatures, should obey him and serve him. And although the higher stars do give the inclination, and, as it were, sign man and other earthly bodies for the manner of their birth, yet that power and that dominion are nothing, save only a predestined mandate and office, in which there is nothing occult or abstruse remaining, but the inner force and power is put forth through the external signs. But to return to our proposition concerning the physical signs of men: know that these are twofold, like indeed in outward form, but dissimilar in power and effect. Some are from the upper stars of heaven; others from the lower stars of the micro ­ cosm. Every superior star signs according to birth up to mid- age. That signature is predestined, and is not without its own peculiar force. It is attested by a man ’ s nature and condition of life. But whatever the lower star of the microcosm signs from birth has it origin from the father and the mother, as often as the mother affects by her imagination or appetite, her fear or dread, the unborn child in her body with supernatural signs by means of their own close contact. These are called mothers ’ marks, or uterine marks. We have spoken of these before, so 186"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"spare ourselves the labour of repetition, since it is our purpose to treat of physiognomical signs alone, among which we under ­ stand those signs of men the like whereof neither the father nor the mother have borne in their body. Of this class are black or grey eyes, too small or too large; a long, crooked, or sharp- pointed nose; hollows in the jaws, high cheekbones, a flat or broad nose, small or large ears, a long neck, an oblong face, a mouth large and drawn down; hair thick or fine, abundant or scanty, black, yellow, or red, etc. Of these signs, if one or more appear in a man, be sure that he will not lack the quali ­ ties signified thereby. Only you must judge them according to the rules of physiognomy, and have had experience in the art of signature, according to which you can judge a man by outward signs. Descending, then, to the practical portion of our subject, let us repeat a few of these signs and their signification. Black eyes not only denote a healthy constitution, but also, for the most part, a constant mind free from doubt and fear, healthy and hearty, truthful and loving virtue. Grey eyes are the sign of a crafty man, ambiguous and incon ­ sistent. Weak eyes denote good counsels, clever and profound deliberations, and so on. Bright eyes, which turn up, down, and to both sides, denote a false, clever man, who cannot be deceived, faithless, shirking work, desirous of ease, seeking to gain his livelihood in laziness, by gambling, usury, impurity, theft, and the like. Small eyes, somewhat deeply sunk, indicate weak sight, and often impending blindness in old age. At the same time, they denote brave men, bellicose, crafty, and adroit, factious, capa ­ ble of enduring misfortune, and whose departure from life is, for the most part, of a tragic character. Large eyes denote a greedy, voracious man, especially if they project far out of the head. Eyes which are constantly winking indicate weak sight, a timid and careful man. Eyes which move quickly hither and thither, under the glance of men, indicate an amorous heart, provident, and of quick invention.

Now, chiromancy is a science which not only inspects the hands of men, and from their lines and wrinkles makes its judge ­ ment, but, moreover, it also considers all herbs, woods, flints, earths, and rivers — in a word, whatever has lines, veins, and wrinkles. I. xi. 384 14.13 CONCERNING MINERAL SIGNS Minerals and metals, apart from fire and dry material, show their indications and signs which they have received at once from the Archeus and from the higher stars, each one telling its genus by differences of colour and of earth. The mineral of gold differs from the mineral of silver. So the mineral of sil ­ ver differs from the mineral of copper. The mineral of copper differs from the mineral of iron. So also that of iron from that of tin and of lead. And so with the rest. None can deny, then, that by means of chiromancy all minerals and metallic bodies of mines, which lie hid in secret places of the earth, may be known trom their external signs. That is the chiromancy of mines, veins, and lodes, by which not only those things which are hidden within are brought forth, but also the exact depth and richness of the mine and yield of metal arc made manifest. Now, in this chiromancy three things are necessary to be"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"known, the age, depth, and breadth of the veins, as was said just now in the case of herbs. For the older its veins, the richer and more abundant in metals is the mine . . . In pursuit of our present purpose, then, I pass on to a very brief practical exposition concerning the chiromancy of mines. The deeper and broader the veins are, the older they may be known to be. When the tracts of the veins arc stretched to a very long distance, and then gape, it is a bad sign. For as the courses ot the veins gape, so the mines themselves gape, which fact they indicate by their depth. Although sometimes good mines are found with a very deep descent, they for the most part vanish more and more, so that they cannot be worked wdthout great expenditure of toil. But where those veins are increased by other accessory ones, or in any other way are fre ­ quently cut off, that is a fortunate sign, indicating that the mines are good not only on the surface, but that they increase in depth and are multiplied, so that they are rendered rich mines, and yield most ample treasure. I. xi. 387-9 __________ DE NATURA RERUM (1537) ____________ _ 189 14.14 CONCERNING CERTAIN PARTICULAR SIGNS OF NATURAL AND SUPERNATURAL THINGS We must now, in due course, speak of some peculiar signs, con ­ cerning which nothing up to this time has been handed down. In this treatise it will be very necessary that you who boast your skill in the science of signatures, who also wish to be your ­ selves called signators, should rightly understand what we say. In this place we are not going to speak theoretically, but prac ­ tically, and we will put forth our opinion comprised in the fewest possible words for your comprehension. First of all, know that the signatory art teaches how to give true and genuine names to all things. All of these Adam the Protoplast truly and entirely understood. So it was that after the Creation he gave its own proper name to everything, to animals, trees, roots, stones, minerals, metals, waters, and the like, as well as to other fruits of the earth, of the water, of the"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"PARACELSUS air, and of the fire. Whatever names he imposed upon these were ratified and confirmed by God. Now these names were based upon a true and intimate foundation, not on mere opin ­ ion, and were derived from a predestined knowledge, that is to say, the senatorial art. Adam is the first signator. Indeed, it cannot be denied that genuine names flow forth from the Hebrew language, too, and are bestowed upon each thing according to its nature and condition. The names which arc given in the Hebrew tongue indicate by their mere bestowal the virtue, power, and property of the very thing to which they belong. So when we say, ‘ This is a pig, a horse, a cow, a bear, a dog, a fox, a sheep, etc.,' the name of a pig indicates a foul and impure animal. A horse indicates a strong and patient animal; a cow, a voracious and insatiable one; a bear, a strong, victorious, and untamed animal; a fox, a crafty and cunning animal; a dog, one faithless in its nature; a sheep, one that is placid and useful, hurting no one. Hence it happens that some ­ times a man is called a pig on account of his sordid and pig ­ gish life; a horse, on account of his endurance, for which he is remarkable beyond all else; a cow, because he is never tired of eating and drinking, and his stomach knows no modera ­ tion; a bear, because he is bigger and stronger than other peo ­ ple; a fox, because he is versatile and cunning, accommodating himself to all, and not easily offending anybody; a dog, because he is not faithful to anything beyond his own mouth, and shows himself unaccommodating and faithless to all; or a sheep, because he hurts nobody but himself, and is of more use to anyone else than to himself. Then, again, many herbs and roots got their names, not from any one inborn virtue and faculty, but also from their figure, form, and appearance, as the Morsus Diaboli, Pentaphyllum, Cynoglossum, Ophioglossum, Hippuris, Hepatica, Buglosum, Dentaria, Calcatrippa ( consolida regal is). Perforata, Satyrion or Orchis, Victorialis, Sydcrica, Petfoliata, Prunella, Heliotrope, and many others which need not be recounted here, but separately in the Herbary. But, moreover, there are other signs which are worthy of our wonder, when, for example, the Archeus is the signator and signifies on the umbilical cord of the foetus by means of knots. 190 ___"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"from which it can be told how many children the mother has had or will have. The same signator signs the horns of the stag with branches by which its age is known. As many branches as the horns have, so many years old is the stag. Since there is an addition of a new branch to the horn every year, the age of the stag can be set down as twenty or thirty years. So, too, the signator marks the horns of the cow with cir ­ cles from which it is known how many calves she has borne. Every circle indicates one calf. The same signator thrusts out the first teeth of the horse so that for the first seven years its age can be certainly known from its teeth. When the horse is first born it has fourteen teeth, of which it sheds two every year, so in seven years all of them fall out. For this reason a horse more than seven years old can only be judged by one who is very skilled and practised. The same signator marks the beak and talons of a bird with particular signs, so that every practised fowler can judge its age from these. The same signator marks the tongues of pigs with blisters, by which their impurity can be known. If the tongue is foul, so is the whole body. The same signator marks the clouds with different colours, whereby the tempests of the sky can be prognosticated. So also he signs the circle of the moon with distinct colours, each one of which has its own special interpretation. Redness generally indicates coming wind; greenness or blackness, rain. The two mixed, wind with rain. At sea this is a sign which generally portends tempests and storms. Brightness and clear whiteness are a good sign, especially on the ocean. For the most part they presage quiet and serene weather. ____________ DE NATURA RERUM (1537)_____________ 191 I. xi. 397-400"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"__________________________________ IS __________________________________ ARCHIDOXIS MAGICA ( c . 1570) [Although attributed to Paracelsus, this work was most prob ­ ably written by Gerhard Dorn, the prominent Paracelsist, or one of his followers, around 1570. The use of the word Archi- doxis ’ in its title was a convenient ploy to present the text as a newly discovered occult variant of the famous 1526 work. However, the Archidoxis magica reads as a typical sixteenth- century magical text full of remedies and practices based on astrology and sympathetic magic without any resemblance to its earlier namesake. Johannes Huser regarded the text as authentic and included it in his standard edition of Paracelsus ’ collected works at the end of the sixteenth century.

These things will be reckoned superstitions, sorcery, and contrary to nature; it will be thought that they are idolatrous practices and that diaboli ­ cal conjurations arc required for their accomplishment. People will say, how can it be possible that metals engraved with characters, letters, and words could have this power, unless they"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"were made and prepared with sorcery and the aid of the devil? We answer thus: You seem to believe in these powers and vir ­ tues, if the devil ’ s aid is involved; but you cannot believe that the creator of Nature, God in heaven, has as much power and could give such powers and virtues to the metals, roots, herbs, stones, and such like. Thus you appear to think the devil more powerful, artful, and almighty than the one eternal, omnipo ­ tent and merciful God who created all these metals, stones, herbs, roots, and such like, and all things which live or move in or upon the earth, water, and air for the use and benefit of mankind. But it is certain and experience teaches that the changes of time have great power and effect, particularly in several metals which are produced at special times, as is well known and which wc have experienced in many ways and forms. No one can claim that the metals are dead and lifeless. For these metals contain oils, salts, sulphurs, and quintessences, which are the supreme preservatives, and have the greatest virtue to nourish human life and surpass all other simples, as we will show in all our remedies.

Therefore I say that the metals and stones have life in them just as roots, herbs, and other fruits, though of differ ­ ent kinds according to the time of the metal ’ s preparation. For the time itself has a certain power which is obvious from many arguments and which we do not need to report, since they are so commonly known.

For this reason I will begin with the linea vitae and lignum around noon and the great cleft mark on the forehead of man. Such a cleft mark is not only found on the human cranium but also in all plants and elements. There is also a line in water, which we call ileida, where two waters cleave and form a line as in the sea. The rainbow in the air and fire is a similar phenome ­ non ...

Wild animals bear the fiery cleft, while game birds have two clefts, one on the head, another at their tail. The peacock demonstrates this with his rainbow colours and when he spreads his tail . . .

A flower indicates by its number of petals the region in which it belongs; thus a five- petal flower or its virtue belongs in the quinarium . . .

He became a controversial figure by rejecting the slavish dependence of contemporary medicine on abstract reason and classical texts: he wanted to found a new medical science based on experiment, observation, chemical remedies and Renaissance philosophy. Rooted in the spiritual relation between man and the cosmos, his ideas have remained influential long after his death, and he is known today as 'the father of modern medicine'. With the growing interest in the esoteric and in alternative medicine (especially homoeopathy), Paracelsus' magical and holistic approach is once again highly topical. Tracing his boyhood interest in natural science, his education and journeys throughout Europe, his mission as a lay-preacher and healer, and his conflict with the authorities, this anthology brings his work to the general reader for the first time, showing his importance in the history of ideas and his relevance today.
