Wha t most peop le d o no t know is tha t Joseph Kenned y bough t his Nazi stocks from Prescott Bush. Every great family ha s its scanda l. The Bush family's scan dal is that the y funded Hitler an d profited from the Holocau st. It is quite po ssible tha t \"W\" (an d his boyhood friend William Stamps Farrish, now U S Ambassado r to Britain) ha ve tilted towards Israel perhaps be cau se they wished to atone for the sins of the ir fathers.

The re was a g reat deal of skepticism ten yea rs ago whe n I first wrote abou t the Bush - Nazi scand al in my book, \"The Secret War Against the Jews.\" Its historical validity has now bee n confirmed by the g rou nd b reaking work of reporter John Bucha nan .

The se long bu ried US government files demonstrate tha t the Bush family stayed o n the corporate bo ards of Nazi fron t grou ps even after they kne w beyond a shad ow of a do ubt tha t the y were he lping the finan cial cause of the Third Reich. It was all abo ut the mone y. Nazi Germany is where the Bush family fortune came from, and where the Harrimans, and the Rockefellers increased their fortun es to o bscene p rop ortions. Of course some of them were quite rich to beg in with. The Harriman railroa d monop oly helped create the Rockefeller oil mon opo ly in the 18 00's. The ir de spicable price fixing schemes ea rned them the p ress labe l \"the Robbe r Baron s.\" My favorite Rep ublican Ted dy Roosevelt ruined the ir rap aciou s profits with his an ti - monopo ly and anti - trust leg islation.

This loop hole law let the Robbe r Baron s loose to prey on a he lpless world already ravage d by the hu man and and financial cost of WW I.

To save tran spo rtation costs, the Robbe r Baron s looked for a middle grou nd in eastern Poland for a future factory site.

The Polish town was na med Oswieczim, later known to the world b y its German name: Auschwitz. It was no t a killing factory then, although slave labor was always contemplated for the maximum profit factor. Auschwitz was designe d to p rocess Silesian coal into tar additives necessary for Russian aviation fuel. It was a high tech German chemical factory bu ilt to balance out Harriman 's Russian - to - Germany export trade. The Rockefeller - Harriman front compa ny that fina nced Auschwitz was called Brown Brothers Harriman. It is s till arou nd toda y. Our Presiden t's grea t granfather, Herbert Walker, fou nded the compa ny, and app ointed h is impecunious s on - in - law Prescott Bush to the b oards of several ho lding compan ies, all of which became Nazi fron ts.

No matter who won World war II, t he corporate stocks wou ld be shifted a roun d to whichever bank was in a neu tral cou ntry when the war was over. After WW II, t he Dulles brothers' shell ga me deceived a gu llible and war - weary world. The \"ne utral\" Dutch ban k reclaimed their German assetts as \"stolen \" by the Nazis, and the whole merry fraud continued . Prescott Bush go t his Union Bank back from the US Government in 19 51, despite its seizure in 19 42 as a Nazi front. Prescott Bush and father - in - law Walker were pa id two sha res worth a bou t $1 .5 million in 1951 do llars. It was a pe tty payoff for a job well don e. Nearly 4,000 sha res (98% of the Union Bank holdings) were he ld by Rolan d Harriman in trust for the Rockefellers. That's abou t three b illion in 1 951 dollars, more than 30 b illion dollars in tod ays mone y. Most of it was reinvested in po st - war Germany where the y made even more obscen e profits. After all, German y was just as c ash starved a fter World War II as the y were after World War I. It was just an othe r cycle in the Robb er Baron's spread she et. Everyone mad e mone y off the Holocau st, excep t of cou rse the Jews and the Allied soldiers. A few decades later thing s had q uited do wn an d all the Nazi mone y finally came h ome to Wall Street.

Later the compa ny shifted from St. Lou is to the prestigious add ress of 1 Wall Street. . . . \"Walker was one o f Hitler's most powerful finan cial suppo rters in the United States. The relationship went all the way ba ck to 1 924 , when Fritz Thyssen , the German industrialist, was fina ncing Hitler's infant Nazi party. As mentioned in earlier chap ters, the re were American contributors as well. \"Some American s were just bigo ts and mad e the ir conn ection s to Germany throu gh Allen Dulles's firm of Sullivan an d Cromwell becau se they suppo rted Fascism.

The key figure was Averill Harriman , a domina ting figure in the American estab lishment. . . . \"The firm originally was known as W. A. Harriman & Compa ny. The link between Harriman & Company's American investors and Thyssen started in the 192 0s, through the Union Ban king Corporation, which be gan trading in 1924 . In just one three - year pe riod , the Harriman firm sold more than $50 million o f German bond s to American investors.

It was the sort of favor families do to help the ir children make a start in life, but Prescott came to regret it bitterly. Walker made Prescott vice p residen t of W. A. Harriman. The p roblem was that Walker's specialty was c ompanies that trade d with Germany.

The suppressed Al Qaida document tend s to suppo rt recent claims of a cover - up mad e by several mid - level intelligen ce and law enforcement figu res. The ir on going terrorist investiga tions appe ar to have b een hindered du ring the same sensitive time pe riod while the Enron Corpo ration was still neg otiating with the Taliban . An inad vertent result of the Taliban p ipe line cover - up was that the Taliban ’ s frien ds in Al Qaida were a ble to complete the ir last eigh t months of prep arations for 9/11 while the Enron secrecy block was still in force. Although the latest orde r to b lock investiga tion s alleg edly resulted from Enron ’ s J an uary 200 2 ap pea l to Vice Preside nt Dick Chene y, it ap pea rs that there were at lea st three previous block orde rs, each bu ilding u pon the othe r, stretching ba ck for decades an d involving bo th Rep ublican and Democratic ad ministrations. The first block came in the 1970 ’ s, as a result of Congressiona l rea ction to do mestic espion age aga inst the an ti - Vietnam war movement. I n a case of blatan t over - rea ction, the FBI placed a ll houses of worship an d religious charities off - limits for any surveillance whatsoe ver unless the re was ind epe nden t probab le cau se. This meant tha t all Mosqu es and o ther Muslim meeting places for terrorist groups were e ffectively off limits until after a crime ha d be en committed . The block orde r was not lifted u ntil last wee k by Atty. General Ashcroft. The secon d block order, in force since the 1980 ’ s, was against any investigation that would emba rrass the Saud i Royal family. Originally, it was de signed to con cea l Sau di suppo rt for Muslim extremists figh ting aga inst the Soviets in Afghan istan an d Che chn ya, but it wen t too far.

A few years afterwards, US ene rgy compa nies (Enron , as the Afgh an p ipe line consultant for UNOCAL) used the Saud i intelligence conne ction to the Taliban to b egin ne gotiations for a p ipeline across Afgh anistan . Prince Turki, chief of Saudi inteligence, has pub licly admitted making several trips into Afgh anistan to n ego tiate a p eace mission with the Taliba n.

Sho rtly afterward, ano ther Repub lican newspape r, the Boston Herald, ran a scathing expo se o n the nu mbe r of White Hou se officials with investmen ts in Saudi oil, calling it an \"obscene conflict of interest.\" It shou ld b e no ted tha t Presiden t Bush a t first semed to reject his father's advice abo ut Israel quite strong ly, and secrtely orde red a ll American troo ps to be gin a total withd rawl from Sau di Arabia.

A plausible explanation for the dramatic policy reversal is that someon e (alleg edly Chene y) told Presiden t Bush to call off the do gs at CIA and FBI, be cau se if the Saudis went down, they wou ld take his father down with the m. I think our President has a g ood hea rt, bu t is completely boxed in a nd d oes no t know ho w to ge t ou t from un der his father's lega cy.

As Crown Prince Abd ullah's visit to both Bushe s in Texas showed, a modu s vivendi has be en reached.

Both side s have ag reed to pretend tha t the y ha ve always been a llies in the war ag ainst terrorism, an d that Iraq is the rea l ene my. Mutual blackmail makes a bit of sen se.

Tha t could e xplain why he is resisting Cong ress on both the Enron and p re - 9/11 intellige nce do cuments. I f Cong ress ever con nects the two investiga tions, the whole hou se of cards will collapse. Most of my sources say that Bush and Rice may ha ve bee n de liberately kep t ou t of the loo p by Che ney. For example, it was Chen ey, not Rice, who saw the Pho enix memo before 9 /11.

Moreo ver, it con firms that Al Qaida was informed of the se n ego tiations from the earliest stage s. This raises an interesting question . The Al Qaida author, Moha mmed Atef, must ha ve known that his repo rt had fallen into American h and s whe n his operative's computer was cap tured b y the FBI.

Aroun d the start of the 200 0 ge neral election campa ign , the first sign s of suspicions also a rose tha t Enron was trying to ga in windfall profits by man ipu lating the California ene rgy market. In August 20 00, an e mployee with Sou thern California Edison sent the Fed eral Energy Reg ulatory Comm ission (FERC ) a memo, entitled \"California Electricity Markets: Issues for Examina tion .\" The memo expressed concerns that Enron an d other electricity provide rs to California ’ s dereg ulated e nergy market were ga ming the system by cutting o ff sup ply an d creating p hon y cong estion in the e lectricity grid to run u p ene rgy prices.

The story quo ted a White House o fficial's blunt statemen t that all the terrorism warning s America h as recently received from the Bush ad ministration were b eing used solely to deflect criticism. Recent revelations have surfaced tha t the Bush ad ministration h ad b een spe cifically warne d of 9/11 - style attacks by a host of foreign intelligen ce services, and failed to prop erly ad dress them. In orde r to get ou t from un der any censure for failing to dea l with these warning s, politics transmog rified into the u se of fear to cow the popu lace. On May 30th, politics came into the 9/11 issue from a totally une xpe cted direction . Enter Larry Klayman, Gen eral Coun sel for the con servative activist group Judicial Watch. Klayman ha s be en o n the scen e for years, coming into p rominen ce as one of the foremost an ti - Clinton b ombardiers on the Right. Best known for his prepon deran ce of the theory tha t Clinton Commerce Secretary Ron Brown was assassinated , an d tha t the plane crash that actua lly killed h im was merely a coverup, Klayman spent a great dea l of time sprea ding the story of the 'Clinton Body Count' - tho se unfortuna te sou ls whacked b y Bill be cau se the y go t too close to his drug - runn ing out of Arkansas airports, or because the y asked too many qu estion s ab out his s ex life, etc. Klayman mana ged to sue the Clinton White Hou se some 18 times be fore 1 999 . On May 30th, Klayman emerged from the mists of an ti - Clintonism and fired a stupen dou s broadside a cross the bo w of the Bush a dministration and the FBI. Appe aring be fore membe rs of the press in a con feren ce broa dcast by C - SPA N, Klayman introd uced an 11 - year veteran FBI agen t na med Robe rt Wright. Jud icial Watch h as claimed Wrigh t as a client, and intends to d efen d him aga inst what Klayman describes as a serious campa ign by the FBI an d the Depa rtment of Justice to intimidate and de stroy him. Why? According to Klayman, Wrigh t ha s been sou nding a n alarm within the FBI for years abo ut terrorist activities within the United States. Rather than h eed Wright's warning s, the FBI ha s deflected an d obstructed his efforts to curtail da nge rous movements by age nts of Hamas an d Hezbollah . Wright's activities within the FBI were g eared towards thwarting mon ey - lau nde ring activities by these age nts, an d he is c laiming tha t his efforts were stymied be cau se importan t go vernment officials like Colin Powell have bee n codd ling the se pro - Palestinian groups to p rotect the reputation o f Yasser Arafat. One can o nly assume the h igh er pu rpose o f this c odd ling was to preserve tattered hop es for a neg otiated settlemen t in the Mideast. Klayman leane d across the p odium at the press on Thursday an d claimed tha t the FBI \"did n ot do its job\" rega rding 9/11, that Wright had bee n trying since 199 9 to ge t the FBI to clean h ouse be fore disaster struck, and that his reward for doing so was threats of civil suits, loss of employment an d crimina l charge s. Klayman juxtap osed this aga inst the recent praise h eape d up on Colleen Rowley, the Minne sota FBI agen t whose whistleblowing memo to FBI Director Robe rt Mueller ou tlining all of the agen cy's failures to see 9/11 coming was lionized b y the Director as he an noun ced the da wn of a ne w improved FBI. Wright was threa tened while Rowley is praised , said Klayman . The compa rison was de vastating . The FBI bo re the brunt of Klayman's lashing, bu t it was definitely not alone. The Bush administration was blasted as, \"...an ad ministration which, despite be ing elected on the basis of restoring na tiona l security, slep t for nine months, and d id virtually nothing to shore u p the inadeq uacies of the FBI.\" Klayman wen t on to de scribe the Bush administration as, \"...an administration which comes forward yesterday to cover their backside a fter it becomes appa rent that the y hid information from the American peo ple for nine months - material information as to ho w, in the new ad mission of FBI Director Robe rt Mueller, the 9/11 a ttacks c ould have p ossibly been p reven ted.\" Klayman ad dressed Vice President Dick Chen ey spe cifically, lambasting h is recen t claim tha t America is de fen seless ag ainst future terrorism.

Wright wen t on to d escribe his work with the FBI. For many y ears, he had worked in the Chicago office on coun ter - terrorism cases that focused on mon ey - lau nde ring efforts by terrorist cells ope rating within the United States. His work develop ed into an o peration tha t was named 'Bulgar Betrayal,' which seemed on the verge o f be coming o fficially design ated as a major case becau se o f its far reach a nd n ational security implications. Before he was finishe d, a Saud i bu sinessman n amed Yasin Kadi be came implicated in the terrorism fun ding. Wrigh t was careful to note o n Thursday tha t, one month after the 9/11 attacks, Kadi was named b y the Federal go vernment as a fina ncial sup porter of Osama bin L aden . Yet Kadi's name was known to Wright well before 9 /11, whe n the Bulgar Betrayal investiga tions were taking place. Did h is work take root within the FBI? Did his superiors note the dang ers implicit in the a ctivities of the terrorists Wright had pinpointed ? \"FBI manag ement,\" said Wrigh t on Thu rsda y, \"intentiona lly and repe ated ly thwarted my attempts to lau nch a more compreh ensive investigation to identify and to neu tralize terrorists.\" Wright had to pu rcha se compu ter software and ha rdware n ecessary for his investiga tions because the FBI failed to allocate the necessary fun ds to he lp his work. A week after 9/11, Wrigh t attempted to de liver his con cerns to several members of Cong ress so the g laring gap s in American nationa l security could be a ddressed, but was threa tene d by the FBI and the Justice Dep artment. I n fact, he was told that he could not travel beyond Chicago withou t specific pe rmission from the FBI. Wright's frustration at the FBI's inaction reg arding h is warnings led him to write a 500 pag e manu script detailing the Bureau's anti - terrorism failings en titled \"Fatal Betrayals of the Intelligen ce Mission.\" Beyond describing the myriad ways the FBI and the governmen t ha ve failed to p rotect Americans from terrorism, the manu script goe s on to demand a thorou gh h ouse - clean ing within the FBI. I t seems clea r after listening to Wright's press conference that the main rea son why FBI Director Mue ller ha s chosen to embrace whistleblowing age nt Rowley while threa ten ing agen t Wright comes do wn to the existence of that man uscript. Wright conclud ed h is remarks on Thu rsda y in dramatic and emotional fashion. \"My efforts,\" he said, \"ha ve a lways been gea red towards neu tralizing the terrorist threa ts tha t focused o n taking the lives of American citizen s, in ad dition to harming the n ational and e cono mic security of America. However, as a d irect result of the incompeten ce, and a t times inten tional obstruction o f justice by FBI man age men t to prevent me from bringing terrorists to justice, Americans ha ve u nknowing ly bee n expo sed to p oten tial terrorist attacks for years.\" Page 20 of 26 John - Loftus.com 4/15/04 http://www .john - loftus.com/enron3. asp"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"He wen t on to state, \"Knowing what I know, I can con fide ntly say tha t until the investiga tive respo nsibilities for terrorism are removed from the FBI, I will not feel safe.\" At this point, Wrigh t pau sed a long momen t be fore con tinu ing . \"To the families and victims of Septembe r 11th,\" he finally said throug h choked voice, wiping a tear from his eye, \"on b eha lf of John Vincent, Barry Carmod y and myself...we're sorry.\" These last words were e ssentially sob bed into the microp hon e, an d with tha t Wright fled the pod ium. It sho uld be noted tha t the na mes he mentioned - Vincen t an d Carmody - were later de scribe d by Klayman a s FBI age nts prep aring to come forward \"with the truth\" as Wright did.

Perhaps, after eight yea rs of an ti - Clinton jiha d along the halls of the FBI, Klayman was the on ly lawyer he 'd ever hea rd of.

Bush's forekno wledg e of 9/11 ha s be en g ospel for mon ths, and the fact tha t Klayman h as helped confirm the ir suspicion s only add s humor to a truly blea k s cenario. All of this falls unde r the broa der political spe ctrum of the se recent 9/11 revelations. Wright's c laims of FBI malfeasance ha ve become an accen t in the symph ony of accusation that include Rowley's assertions and dozen s of terror warnings from foreign intelligen ce services s uch as the French Directorate o f Territorial Security (DST). The DST was screaming a t Rowley's Minne sota FBI office abou t Zacarias Mou ssaou i an d terrorist plans to crash airplanes into impo rtant targe ts, but no o ne from Rowley's office could get FBI he adqu arters to pa y attention to these warnings un til it was too late. Wha t the FBI and the Justice Depa rtment will do with the information coming from the se truth - telling ag ents, who squ at above Ashcroft's door like the raven , remains to be seen in the long run. The immediate return upo n this informationa l investmen t doe s not bod e well. On the same da y that Wrigh t revealed h is information , the FBI relea sed a warning for everyone to be on the loo k - out for terrorists bea ring shoulder - lau nched missile weapo ns. If that terror - warning d og g ets wagge d an y harde r, someone 's going to g et bit. More ominously, Ashcroft ann oun ced on Thursda y that the Justice Depa rtmen t plans to extend its Patriot Act mand ate into the surveillan ce of chu rche s an d po litical group s.

As the book details, a U.S. de leg ation led by Ambassado r to Pakistan Tom Simon s met on nu merous occasions with h igh ranking Taliba n officials in the spring and early summer of 20 01. The Americans sou ght the turnover of Osama b in La den and Afgha n ap proval for the construction o f an oil and gas pipeline throu gh their cou ntry by a con sortium of oil compan ies led by California - based Unocal. In return, the U.S. offered to pe rmit the Taliba n to sell its oil on world markets, to de liver direct foreign a id a ssistance and take other step s to informally recogn ize the Taliban a s the leg itmate government of Afganistan de spite its deplorab le human righ ts record. According to pa rticipa nts in these talks, the American s made it clea r to the Taliban that unless it accep ted this \"carpet of gold\" they would be bu ried in a \"carpe t of bombs\" tha t would de stroy Afghan istan, just as much of Iraq ha d be en reduced to rubble a fter its invasion of Kuwait. The Taliba n refused to accep t this offer and the talks broke do wn in July 2001 . The most straigh tforward explan ation for the September 11 a ttacks is that the y were a first strike aga inst U.S. targets by Al Qae da forces trying to anticipate a promised future U.S. attack on Afgh anistan .

The officials s aid the C.I.A. learned in early 2001 that Khalid a l - Midha r, who d ied in the attack on the Pentag on, was linked to a suspe ct in the bo mbing of the Navy destroyer Cole in Octobe r 200 0. The a gen cy had said previously tha t it did not learn o f Mr. Midha r's c onne ctions to Al Qaeda o r his multiple visits to the United States until the month before the h ijackings, when an increase in \"cha tter\" abou t terrorist threats prompted a review of the C.I.A.'s terrorism files. C.I.A. officials also ne glected to advise the F.B.I. and o ther ag encies when it lea rned of Mr. Midha r's conne ctions to the terrorist group, the officials said. As a result, he was no t put on a ny governmen t watch list until after the Aug ust review, enab ling h im to en ter the country un hind ered . The State Depa rtment routinely ren ewed h is expired visa in Jun e 200 1. The performance o f agen cies like the F.B.I. and C.I.A. is unde r intense scrutiny as the House an d Sen ate intelligen ce committee s prepa re for hea ring s, starting Tuesday, into the lap ses that be came kno wn on ly after the Sept. 11 attacks. Much of the criticism to date ha s focused on the F.B.I.; t oda y's disclosures abou t the C.I.A.'s kno wledg e, repo rted in this week's issue of Newswee k, are the first to draw que stions abo ut the C.I.A.'s action s. In sepa rate app earan ces on television n ews prog rams tod ay, Attorney General John Ashcroft and the F.B.I. director, Robe rt S. Mue ller III, defen ded the ir ha ndling of their own investigation s an d said the y were coo perating fully with Congress, pa ssing tens of tho usands of documents to the committees. But Mr. Mueller ackno wledge d on the CBS prog ram \"Face the Nation \" that \"we ha ve to do a be tter job p ulling the se p ieces tog ethe r, an alyzing them and disseminating them.\" The C.I.A.'s find ing tha t Mr. Midhar cou ld b e tied to Al Qae da terrorism was an important one, the g overnment officials said. If other ag encies ha d known it, the information migh t have led to the d iscovery that Mr. Midh ar an d an a ssociate he lived with in California, Nawaq Alha zmi, an othe r hijacker, had a ttende d fligh t schoo ls in the United States. As a result, when an F.B.I. agen t in Phoen ix warne d his headq uarters in July 20 01 that Osama bin L aden 's followers migh t be studying at fligh t scho ols in this coun try in prep aration for terrorist attacks, the age ncy did no t rea lize that Mr. Midh ar an d Mr. Alha zmi ha d taken such flight training . One intelligence official said the C.I.A.'s sharing its information would most likely not have p revented the Sept. 11 attacks. \"The no tion tha t this would have chan ged history or rolled up the hijacking plot is high ly speculative,\" the official said. But such commun ication s breakdowns in the months be fore the Sept. 11 a ttacks ha ve led some officials, including Mr. Mueller, to say that a be tter sharing o f information might have led the au tho rities to thwart the attacks. The C.I.A. first lea rned of Mr. Midh ar an d Mr. Alhazmi in 20 00, after the men were ide ntified as participan ts in a Jan uary meeting of terrorist suspe cts in Malaysia. Sometime in 20 00 the a gen cy also learne d that both men had visited the United States, Mr. Midhar on several occasion s. But it did no t und erstand the men 's significance un til after the Cole bombing in Octob er 20 00. By late that yea r or early the next, it ha d conne cted Mr. Midha r with a Qaed a suspect in that attack. The C.I.A. then lea rned that Mr. Midhar had e ntered the coun try multiple times before the Cole inciden t. Yet it was no t until Aug. 23 , 20 01, after the C.I.A.'s review of its terrorism files, tha t the names of the two men were passed on to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. By then , the immigration a gen cy foun d, they had already en tered the cou ntry. The F.B.I. beg an a n investigation a nd was still searching for the two men whe n the hijackings occurred.

It rings a be ll. In my old a ge, I ha ve forgotten what I ha ve lea rned a nd o ften do not remembe r what I ha ve n ot. I n my misspent youth I was forced to rea d the Gallic wars in La tin, and Xeno pho n's invasion of Persia in Attic Greek. (an aba sis an d katab asis). I ha ve forgo tten tha t too . The only useful thing I have learned is to be humble. Life is balan ce. My inclination is to be u seful to society. I ha ve a small ab ility to un derstand and to teach. On the o ther ha nd, peop le like us are sworn no t to teach, but to keep o ur expe rtise secret. Was it Voltaire o r Rou sseau who said \"ge nius is the ab ility to live within two extremes witho ut losing you r sanity.\" Life is ba lance. I must be thickheade d, as I risk all this witho ut pay. I see my job a s a ba lan ce b etween the imperative o f secrecy and the ne cessity of democracy. I do ubt tha t I ha ve it right, but here is ho w I see it. My clien ts from the intelligen ce community (who pay me the magnificent sum of one dollar each to p reserve the attorne y c lient privilege) tell me importan t thing s. I then try to find ope n source material or to con vince an app ropriate a gen cy to declassify those top ics abo ut which, in my bu mbling opinion , the pu blic must be taug ht. Despite my s trict adh eren ce to the ope n source d octrine , I often fear that I might ina dverten tly do more harm tha n good . You kno w abou t mosaic intelligen ce, and how an informed pe rson migh t use pu blic pieces of the pu zzle to wreck a secret advan tage , even ina dverten tly. I live in fear that I might do some acciden tal harm. I live in dou bt, in the terror of saying too much. On the o ther ha nd, I suspe ct that if the cardinal sin o f statesman ship is na ivete, the mortal sin of intelligen ce is excessive secrecy. In historical terms, far more da mag e ha s been don e by no t sharing information, than in p reserving compartmen talisation . Life is ba lan ce. I da nce on the edge o f the b lad e. My rules are that I must never seek political advantage or pe rson al profit. John Batchelor paid me the highe st complimen t when he said that I was \"po st - partisan.\" Giving my best jud gment as to wha t must not be said, I then must speak, an d say \"Tell the truth, and let the chips fall whe re the y may.\" It is old scho ol, but a goo d rule.
