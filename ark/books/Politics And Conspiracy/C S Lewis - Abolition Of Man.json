That is why I have chosen as the starting-point for these lectures a little book on English intended for ‘boys and girls in the upper forms of schools’. I do not think the authors of this book (there were two of them) intended any harm, and I owe them, or their pub- lisher, good language for sending me a complimen- tary copy. At the same time I shall have nothing good to say of them. Here is a pretty predicament. I do not want to pillory two modest practising school- masters who were doing the best they knew: but I cannot be silent about what I think the actual 1"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"tendency of their work. I therefore propose to conceal their names. I shall refer to these gentlemen as Gaius and Titius and to their book as The Green Book . But I promise you there is such a book and I have it on my shelves. In their second chapter Gaius and Titius quote the well-known story of Coleridge at the waterfall. You remember that there were two tourists present: that one called it ‘sublime’ and the other ‘pretty’; and that Coleridge mentally endorsed the first judge- ment and rejected the second with disgust. Gaius and Titius comment as follows: ‘When the man said This is sublime , he appeared to be making a remark about the waterfall . . . Actually . . . he was not making a remark about the waterfall, but a remark about his own feelings. What he was saying was really I have feelings associated in my mind with the word “Sublime” , or shortly, I have sublime feelings .’ Here are a good many deep questions settled in a pretty summary fashion. But the authors are not yet fin- ished. They add: ‘This confusion is continually pres- ent in language as we use it. We appear to be saying the abolition of man 2"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"something very important about something: and actually we are only saying something about our own feelings.’ 1 Before considering the issues really raised by this momentous little paragraph (designed, you will remember, for ‘the upper forms of schools’) we must eliminate one mere confusion into which Gaius and Titius have fallen. Even on their own view—on any conceivable view—the man who says This is sublime cannot mean I have sublime feelings . Even if it were granted that such qualities as sublimity were simply and solely projected into things from our own emo- tions, yet the emotions which prompt the projection are the correlatives, and therefore almost the oppo- sites, of the qualities projected. The feelings which make a man call an object sublime are not sublime feelings but feelings of veneration. If This is sublime is to be reduced at all to a statement about the speaker’s feelings, the proper translation would be I have humble feelings . If the view held by Gaius and Titius were consistently applied it would lead to obvious absurdities. It would force them to maintain men without chests 3"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"that You are contemptible means I have contemptible feelings : in fact that Your feelings are contemptible means My feelings are contemptible . But we need not delay over this which is the very pons asinorum of our subject. It would be unjust to Gaius and Titius themselves to emphasize what was doubtless a mere inadvertence. The schoolboy who reads this passage in The Green Book will believe two propositions: firstly, that all sen- tences containing a predicate of value are statements about the emotional state of the speaker, and secondly, that all such statements are unimportant. It is t rue that Gaius and Titius have said neither of these things in so many words. They have treated only one particular predicate of value ( sublime ) as a word descriptive of the speaker’s emotions. The pupils are left to do for themselves the work of extending the same treatment to all predicates of value: and no slightest obstacle to such extension is placed in their way. The authors may or may not desire the extension: they may never have given the question five minutes’ serious thought in their lives. I am not concerned with what they desired the abolition of man 4"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"but with the effect their book will certainly have on the schoolboy’s mind. In the same way, they have not said that judgements of value are unimportant. Their words are that we ‘ appear to be saying something very important’ when in reality we are ‘ only saying some- thing about our own feelings’. No schoolboy will be able to resist the suggestion brought to bear upon him by that word only . I do not mean, of course, that he will make any conscious inference from what he reads to a general philosophical theory that all values are subjective and trivial. The very power of Gaius and Titius depends on the fact that they are dealing with a boy: a boy who thinks he is ‘doing’ his ‘English prep’ and has no notion that ethics, theology, and politics are all at stake. It is not a theory they put into his mind, but an assumption, which ten years hence, its origin forgotten and its presence unconscious, will condition him to take one side in a controversy which he has never recognized as a controversy at all. The authors themselves, I suspect, hardly know what they are doing to the boy, and he cannot know what is being done to him. men without chests 5"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Before considering the philosophical credentials of the position which Gaius and Titius have adopted about value, I should like to show its practical results on the educational procedure. In their fourth chapter they quote a silly advertisement of a pleasure cruise and proceed to inoculate their pupils against the sort of writing it exhibits. 2 The advertisement tells us that those who buy tickets for this cruise will go ‘across the Western Ocean where Drake of Devon sailed’, ‘adventuring after the treasures of the Indies’, and bringing home themselves also a ‘treasure’ of ‘golden hours’ and ‘glowing colours’. It is a bad bit of writ- ing, of course: a venal and bathetic exploitation of those emotions of awe and pleasure which men feel in visiting places that have striking associations with history or legend. If Gaius and Titius were to stick to their last and teach their readers (as they promised to do) the art of English composition, it was their business to put this advertisement side by side with passages from great writers in which the very emo- tion is well expressed, and then show where the dif- ference lies. the abolition of man 6"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"They might have used Johnson’s famous passage from the Western Islands , which concludes: ‘That man is little to be envied, whose patriotism would not gain force upon the plain of Marathon, or whose piety would not grow warmer among the ruins of Iona.’ 3 They might have taken that place in The Prelude where Wordsworth describes how the antiq- uity of London first descended on his mind with ‘Weight and power, Power growing under weight’. 4 A lesson which had laid such literature beside the advertisement and really discriminated the good from the bad would have been a lesson worth teach- ing. There would have been some blood and sap in it—the trees of knowledge and of life growing together. It would also have had the merit of being a lesson in literature: a subject of which Gaius and Titius, despite their professed purpose, are uncom- monly shy. What they actually do is to point out that the lux- urious motor-vessel won’t really sail where Drake did, that the tourists will not have any adventures, that the treasures they bring home will be of a purely men without chests 7"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"metaphorical nature, and that a trip to Margate might provide ‘all the pleasure and rest’ they required. 5 All this is very true: talents inferior to those of Gaius and Titius would have sufficed to discover it. What they have not noticed, or not cared about, is that a very similar treatment could be applied to much good lit- erature which treats the same emotion. What, after all, can the history of early British Christianity, in pure reason, add to the motives for piety as they exist in the eighteenth century? Why should Mr W ords- worth’s inn be more comfortable or the air of London more healthy because London has existed for a long time? Or, if there is indeed any obstacle which will prevent a critic from ‘debunking’ Johnson and Wordsworth (and Lamb, and Virgil, and Thomas Browne, and Mr de la Mare) as The Green Book debunks the advertisement, Gaius and Titius have given their schoolboy readers no faintest help to its discovery. From this passage the schoolboy will learn about literature precisely nothing. What he will learn quickly enough, and perhaps indelibly, is the belief the abolition of man 8"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"that all emotions aroused by local association are in themselves contrary to reason and contemptible. He will have no notion that there are two ways of being immune to such an advertisement—that it falls equally flat on those who are above it and those who are below it, on the man of real sensibility and on the mere trousered ape who has never been able to con- ceive the Atlantic as anything more than so many million tons of cold salt water. There are two men to whom we offer in vain a false leading article on patri- otism and honour: one is the coward, the other is the honourable and patriotic man. None of this is brought before the schoolboy’s mind. On the con- trary, he is encouraged to reject the lure of the ‘Western Ocean’ on the very dangerous ground that in so doing he will prove himself a knowing fellow who can’t be bubbled out of his cash.

In another lit- tle book, whose author I will call Orbilius, I find that the same operation, under the same general anaes- thetic, is being carried out. Orbilius chooses for ‘debunking’ a silly bit of writing on horses, where these animals are praised as the ‘willing servants’ of the early colonists in Australia. 6 And he falls into the same trap as Gaius and Titius. Of Ruksh and Sleipnir and the weeping horses of Achilles and the war- horse in the Book of Job—nay even of Brer Rabbit and of Peter Rabbit—of man’s prehistoric piety to ‘our brother the ox’—of all that this semi-anthropo- morphic treatment of beasts has meant in human his- tory and of the literature where it finds noble or piquant expression—he has not a word to say. 7 Even of the problems of animal psychology as they exist for science he says nothing. He contents himself with explaining that horses are not, secundum lit- teram , interested in colonial expansion. 8 This piece of information is really all that his pupils get from him.

Much less do they learn of the two classes of men who are, respectively, above and below the danger of such writing—the man who really knows horses and really loves them, not with anthropomorphic illusions, but with ordinate love, and the irredeemable urban blockhead to whom a horse is merely an old-fashioned means of transport. Some pleasure in their own ponies and dogs they will have lost; some incentive to cruelty or neglect they will have received; some pleasure in their own know- ingness will have entered their minds. That is their day’s lesson in English, though of English they have learned nothing. Another little portion of the human heritage has been quietly taken from them before they were old enough to understand. I have hitherto been assuming that such teachers as Gaius and Titius do not fully realize what they are doing and do not intend the far-reaching conse- quences it will actually have. There is, of course, another possibility. What I have called (presuming on their concurrence in a certain traditional system of values) the ‘trousered ape’ and the ‘urban blockhead’ men without chests 11"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"may be precisely the kind of man they really wish to produce. The differences between us may go all the way down. They may really hold that the ordinary human feelings about the past or animals or large waterfalls are contrary to reason and contemptible and ought to be eradicated. They may be intending to make a clean sweep of traditional values and start with a new set. That position will be discussed later. If it is the position which Gaius and Titius are holding, I must, for the moment, content myself with pointing out that it is a philosophical and not a literary posi- tion. In filling their book with it they have been unjust to the parent or headmaster who buys it and who has got the work of amateur philosophers where he expected the work of professional grammarians. A man would be annoyed if his son returned from the dentist with his teeth untouched and his head crammed with the dentist’s obiter dicta on bimet- allism or the Baconian theory. But I doubt whether Gaius and Titius have really planned, under cover of teaching English, to propa- gate their philosophy. I think they have slipped into the abolition of man 12"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"it for the following reasons. In the first place, literary criticism is difficult, and what they actually do is very much easier. To explain why a bad treatment of some basic human emotion is bad literature is, if we exclude all question-begging attacks on the emotion itself, a very hard thing to do. Even Dr Richards, who first seriously tackled the problem of badness in literature, failed, I think, to do it. To ‘debunk’ the emotion, on the basis of a commonplace rationalism, is within almost anyone’s capacity. In the second place, I think Gaius and Titius may have honestly misunderstood the pressing educational need of the moment. They see the world around them swayed by emotional propaganda—they have learned from tra- dition that youth is sentimental—and they conclude that the best thing they can do is to fortify the minds of young people against emotion. My own experi- ence as a teacher tells an opposite tale. For every one pupil who needs to be guarded from a weak excess of sensibility there are three who need to be awakened from the slumber of cold vulgarity. The task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles but to men without chests 13"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"irrigate deserts. The right defence against false senti- ments is to inculcate just sentiments. By starving the sensibility of our pupils we only make them easier prey to the propagandist when he comes. For fam- ished nature will be avenged and a hard heart is no infallible protection against a soft head. But there is a third, and a profounder, reason for the procedure which Gaius and Titius adopt. They may be perfectly ready to admit that a good educa- tion should build some sentiments while destroying others. They may endeavour to do so. But it is impossible that they should succeed. Do what they will, it is the ‘debunking’ side of their work, and this side alone, which will really tell. In order to grasp this necessity clearly I must digress for a moment to show that what may be called the educational predicament of Gaius and Titius is different from that of all their predecessors. Until quite modern times all teachers and even all men believed the universe to be such that certain emotional reactions on our part could be either con- gruous or incongruous to it—believed, in fact, that the abolition of man 14"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"objects did not merely receive, but could merit , our approval or disapproval, our reverence or our con- tempt. The reason why Coleridge agreed with the tourist who called the cataract sublime and disagreed with the one who called it pretty was of course that he believed inanimate nature to be such that certain responses could be more ‘just’ or ‘ordinate’ or ‘appropriate’ to it than others. And he believed (cor- rectly) that the tourists thought the same. The man who called the cataract sublime was not intending simply to describe his own emotions about it: he was also claiming that the object was one which merited those emotions. But for this claim there would be nothing to agree or disagree about. To dis- agree with This is pretty if those words simply described the lady’s feelings, would be absurd: if she had said I feel sick Coleridge would hardly have replied No; I feel quite well .

All things were made to be yours and you were made to prize them according to their value.’ 10 St Augustine defines virtue as ordo amoris , the ordinate condition of the affections in which every object is accorded that kind of degree of love which is appropriate to it. 11 Aristotle says that the aim of education is to make the pupil like and dislike what he ought. 12 When the age for reflective thought comes, the pupil who has been thus trained in ‘ordi- nate affections’ or ‘just sentiments’ will easily find the first principles in Ethics; but to the corrupt man they will never be visible at all and he can make no progress in that science. 13 Plato before him had said the same. The little human animal will not at first have the right responses. It must be trained to feel pleasure, liking, disgust, and hatred at those things which really are pleasant, likeable, disgusting and hateful. 14 In the Republic , the well-nurtured youth is one ‘who would see most clearly whatever was the abolition of man 16"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"amiss in ill-made works of man or ill-grown works of nature, and with a just distaste would blame and hate the ugly even from his earliest years and would give delighted praise to beauty, receiving it into his soul and being nourished by it, so that he becomes a man of gentle heart. All this before he is of an age to reason; so that when Reason at length comes to him, then, bred as he has been, he will hold out his hands in welcome and recognize her because of the affinity he bears to her.’ 15 In early Hinduism that conduct in men which can be called good consists in confor- mity to, or almost participation in, the Rta —that great ritual or pattern of nature and supernature which is revealed alike in the cosmic order, the moral virtues, and the ceremonial of the temple. Righteousness, correctness, order, the Rta , is con- stantly identified with satya or truth, correspon- dence to reality. As Plato said that the Good was ‘beyond existence’ and Wordsworth that through virtue the stars were strong, so the Indian masters say that the gods themselves are born of the Rta and obey it. 16 men without chests 17"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Chinese also speak of a great thing (the great- est thing) called the Ta o . It is the reality beyond all predicates, the abyss that was before the Creator Himself. It is Nature, it is the Way, the Road. It is the Way in which the universe goes on, the Way in which things everlastingly emerge, stilly and tranquilly, into space and time. It is also the Way which every man should tread in imitation of that cosmic and supercosmic progression, conforming all activities to that great exemplar. 17 ‘In ritual’, say the Analects , ‘it is harmony with Nature that is prized.’ 18 The ancient Jews likewise praise the Law as being ‘true’. 19 This conception in all its forms, Platonic, Aris- totelian, Stoic, Christian, and Oriental alike, I shall henceforth refer to for brevity simply as ‘the Ta o ’. Some of the accounts of it which I have quoted will seem, perhaps, to many of you merely quaint or even magical. But what is common to them all is some- thing we cannot neglect. It is the doctrine of objec- tive value, the belief that certain attitudes are really true, and others really false, to the kind of thing the universe is and the kind of things we are. Those who the abolition of man 18"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"know the Tao can hold that to call children delightful or old men venerable is not simply to record a psy- chological fact about our own parental or filial emo- tions at the moment, but to recognize a quality which demands a certain response from us whether we make it or not.

And because our approvals and disapprovals are thus recognitions of objective value or responses to an objective order, therefore emotional states can be in harmony with reason (when we feel liking for what ought to be approved) or out of harmony with reason (when we perceive that liking is due but cannot feel it). No emotion is, in itself, a judgement; in that sense all emotions and sentiments are alogical. But they can be reasonable or unreasonable as they conform to Reason or fail to conform. The heart never takes the place of the head: but it can, and should, obey it. Over against this stands the world of The Green Book . In it the very possibility of a sentiment being men without chests 19"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"reasonable—or even unreasonable—has been ex- cluded from the outset. It can be reasonable or unreasonable only if it conforms or fails to conform to something else. To say that the cataract is sublime means saying that our emotion of humility is appro- priate or ordinate to the reality, and thus to speak of something else besides the emotion; just as to say that a shoe fits is to speak not only of shoes but of feet. But this reference to something beyond the emotion is what Gaius and Titius exclude from every sentence containing a predicate of value. Such state- ments, for them, refer solely to the emotion. Now the emotion, thus considered by itself, cannot be either in agreement or disagreement with Reason. It is irrational not as a paralogism is irrational, but as a physical event is irrational: it does not rise even to the dignity of error. On this view, the world of facts, without one trace of value, and the world of feel- ings, without one trace of truth or falsehood, justice or injustice, confront one another, and no rapproche- ment is possible.

For those within, the task is to train in the pupil those responses which are in themselves appropriate, whether anyone is making them or not, and in mak- ing which the very nature of man consists. Those without, if they are logical, must regard all senti- ments as equally non-rational, as mere mists between us and the real objects. As a result, they must either decide to remove all sentiments, as far as possible, from the pupil’s mind; or else to encourage some sentiments for reasons that have nothing to do with their intrinsic ‘justness’ or ‘ordinacy’. The latter course involves them in the questionable process of creating in others by ‘suggestion’ or incantation a mirage which their own reason has successfully dis- sipated. Perhaps this will become clearer if we take a con- crete instance. When a Roman father told his son that it was a sweet and seemly thing to die for his country, he believed what he said. He was communi- cating to the son an emotion which he himself shared and which he believed to be in accord with the value men without chests 21"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"which his judgement discerned in noble death. He was giving the boy the best he had, giving of his spirit to humanize him as he had given of his body to beget him. But Gaius and Titius cannot believe that in call- ing such a death sweet and seemly they would be saying ‘something important about something’. Their own method of debunking would cry out against them if they attempted to do so. For death is not something to eat and therefore cannot be dulce in the literal sense, and it is unlikely that the real sensa- tions preceding it will be dulce even by analogy. And as for decorum —that is only a word describing how some other people will feel about your death when they happen to think of it, which won’t be often, and will certainly do you no good. There are only two courses open to Gaius and Titius. Either they must go the whole way and debunk this sentiment like any other, or must set themselves to work to produce, from outside, a sentiment which they believe to be of no value to the pupil and which may cost him his life, because it is useful to us (the survivors) that our young men should feel it.

In a word, the old was a kind of propagation—men transmitting manhood to men; the new is merely propaganda. It is to their credit that Gaius and Titius embrace the first alternative. Propaganda is their abomina- tion: not because their own philosophy gives a ground for condemning it (or anything else) but because they are better than their principles. They probably have some vague notion (I will examine it in my next lecture) that valour and good faith and justice could be sufficiently commended to the pupil on what they would call ‘rational’ or ‘biological’ or ‘modern’ grounds, if it should ever become neces- sary.

Let us suppose for a moment that the harder virtues could really be theoretically justifed with no appeal to objective value. It still remains true that no justification of virtue will enable a man to be virtuous. Without the aid of trained emotions the intellect is powerless against the animal organism. I had sooner play cards against a man who was quite sceptical about ethics, but bred to believe that ‘a gen- tleman does not cheat’, than against an irreproach- able moral philosopher who had been brought up among sharpers. In battle it is not syllogisms that will keep the reluctant nerves and muscles to their post in the third hour of the bombardment. The crudest sen- timentalism (such as Gaius and Titius would wince at) about a flag or a country or a regiment will be of more use. We were told it all long ago by Plato. As the king governs by his executive, so Reason in man must rule the mere appetites by means of the ‘spirited element’. 20 The head rules the belly through the chest—the seat, as Alanus tells us, of Magnanimity, 21 of emotions orga- the abolition of man 24"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"nized by trained habit into stable sentiments.

This gives them the chance to say that he who attacks them attacks Intelligence. It is not so. They are not distinguished from other men by any unusual skill in finding truth nor any virginal ardour to pursue her. Indeed it would be strange if they were: a persevering devotion to truth, a nice sense of intellectual honour, cannot be long main- tained without the aid of a sentiment which Gaius and Titius could debunk as easily as any other.

The question is welcome. If by Reason we mean the process actually employed by Gaius and Titius when engaged in debunking (that is, the con- necting by inference of propositions, ultimately derived from sense data, with further propositions), then the answer must be that a refusal to sacrifice oneself is no more rational than a consent to do so. And no less rational. Neither choice is rational—or irrational—at all. From propositions about fact alone no practical conclusion can ever be drawn.

The Inno- vator is trying to get a conclusion in the imperative mood out of premisses in the indicative mood: and though he continues trying to all eternity he cannot succeed, for the thing is impossible. We must there- fore either extend the word Reason to include what our ancestors called Practical Reason and confess that judgements such as society ought to be preserved (though they can support themselves by no reason of the sort that Gaius and Titius demand) are not mere sentiments but are rationality itself; or else we must give up at once, and for ever, the attempt to find a core of ‘rational’ value behind all the sentiments we have debunked. The Innovator will not take the first alter- native, for practical principles known to all men by Reason are simply the Ta o which he has set out to supersede. He is more likely to give up the quest for a ‘rational’ core and to hunt for some other ground even more ‘basic’ and ‘realistic’. the abolition of man 32"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"This he will probably feel that he has found in Instinct. The preservation of society, and of the species itself, are ends that do not hang on the pre- carious thread of Reason: they are given by Instinct. That is why there is no need to argue against the man who does not acknowledge them. We have an instinctive urge to preserve our own species. That is why men ought to work for posterity. We have no instinctive urge to keep promises or to respect indi- vidual life: that is why scruples of justice and human- ity—in fact the Ta o —can be properly swept away when they conflict with our real end, the preserva- tion of the species. That, again, is why the modern situation permits and demands a new sexual moral- ity: the old taboos served some real purpose in help- ing to preserve the species, but contraceptives have modified this and we can now abandon many of the taboos. For of course sexual desire, being instinctive, is to be gratified whenever it does not conflict with the preservation of the species. It looks, in fact, as if an ethics based on instinct will give the Innovator all he wants and nothing that he does not want. the way 33"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"In reality we have not advanced one step. I will not insist on the point that Instinct is a name for we know not what (to say that migratory birds find their way by instinct is only to say that we do not know how migratory birds find their way), for I think it is here being used in a fairly definite sense, to mean an unreflective or spontaneous impulse widely felt by the members of a given species. In what way does Instinct, thus conceived, help us to find ‘real’ values? Is it maintained that we must obey Instinct, that we cannot do otherwise? But if so, why are Green Books and the like written? Why this stream of exhortation to drive us where we cannot help going? Why such praise for those who have submitted to the inevitable? Or is it maintained that if we do obey Instinct we shall be happy and satisfied? But the very question we are considering was that of facing death which (so far as the Innovator knows) cuts off every possible satisfaction: and if we have an instinctive desire for the good of posterity then this desire, by the very nature of the case, can never be satisfied, since its aim is achieved, if at all, when we are dead. It the abolition of man 34"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"looks very much as if the Innovator would have to say not that we must obey Instinct, nor that it will satisfy us to do so, but that we ought to obey it. 2 But why ought we to obey Instinct? Is there another instinct of a higher order directing us to do so, and a third of a still higher order directing us to obey it ?—an infinite regress of instincts? This is pre- sumably impossible, but nothing else will serve. From the statement about psychological fact ‘I have an impulse to do so and so’ we cannot by any ingenu- ity derive the practical principle ‘I ought to obey this impulse’. Even if it were true that men had a sponta- neous, unreflective impulse to sacrifice their own lives for the preservation of their fellows, it remains a quite separate question whether this is an impulse they should control or one they should indulge. For even the Innovator admits that many impulses (those which conflict with the preservation of the species) have to be controlled. And this admission surely introduces us to a yet more fundamental difficulty. Telling us to obey Instinct is like telling us to obey ‘people’. People say different things: so do instincts. the way 35"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Our instincts are at war. If it is held that the instinct for preserving the species should always be obeyed at the expense of other instincts, whence do we derive this rule of precedence? To listen to that instinct speaking in its own cause and deciding it in its own favour would be rather simple-minded. Each instinct, if you listen to it, will claim to be gratified at the expense of all the rest. By the very act of listening to one rather than to others we have already pre- judged the case. If we did not bring to the ex- amination of our instincts a knowledge of their comparative dignity we could never learn it from them. And that knowledge cannot itself be instinc- tive: the judge cannot be one of the parties judged; or, if he is, the decision is worthless and there is no ground for placing the preservation of the species above self-preservation or sexual appetite. The idea that, without appealing to any court higher than the instincts themselves, we can yet find grounds for preferring one instinct above its fellows dies very hard. We grasp at useless words: we call it the ‘basic’, or ‘fundamental’, or ‘primal’, or ‘deepest’ the abolition of man 36"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"instinct. It is of no avail. Either these words conceal a value judgement passed upon the instinct and there- fore not derivable from it, or else they merely record its felt intensity, the frequency of its operation and its wide distribution. If the former, the whole attempt to base value upon instinct has been abandoned: if the latter, these observations about the quantitative aspects of a psychological event lead to no practical conclusion. It is the old dilemma. Either the pre- misses already concealed an imperative or the con- clusion remains merely in the indicative. 3 Finally, it is worth inquiry whether there is any instinct to care for posterity or preserve the species. I do not discover it in myself: and yet I am a man rather prone to think of remote futurity—a man who can read Mr Olaf Stapledon with delight. Much less do I find it easy to believe that the majority of people who have sat opposite me in buses or stood with me in queues feel an unreflective impulse to do anything at all about the species, or posterity. Only people edu- cated in a particular way have ever had the idea ‘pos- terity’ before their minds at all. It is difficult to assign the way 37"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"to instinct our attitude towards an object which exists only for reflective men. What we have by nature is an impulse to preserve our own children and grandchil- dren; an impulse which grows progressively feebler as the imagination looks forward and finally dies out in the ‘deserts of vast futurity’. No parents who were guided by this instinct would dream for a moment of setting up the claims of their hypothetical descen- dants against those of the baby actually crowing and kicking in the room. Those of us who accept the Ta o may, perhaps, say that they ought to do so: but that is not open to those who treat instinct as the source of value. As we pass from mother love to rational plan- ning for the future we are passing away from the realm of instinct into that of choice and reflection: and if instinct is the source of value, planning for the future ought to be less respectable and less obligatory than the baby language and cuddling of the fondest mother or the most fatuous nursery anecdotes of a doting father. If we are to base ourselves upon instinct, these things are the substance, and care for posterity the shadow—the huge, flickering shadow the abolition of man 38"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"of the nursery happiness cast upon the screen of the unknown future. I do not say this projection is a bad thing: but then I do not believe that instinct is the ground of value judgements. What is absurd is to claim that your care for posterity finds its justifica- tion in instinct and then flout at every turn the only instinct on which it could be supposed to rest, tearing the child almost from the breast to crèche and kinder- garten in the interests of progress and the coming race. The truth finally becomes apparent that neither in any operation with factual propositions nor in any appeal to instinct can the Innovator find the basis for a system of values. None of the principles he requires are to be found there: but they are all to be found somewhere else. ‘All within the four seas are his brothers’ (xii. 5 ) says Confucius of the Chün-tzu , the cuor gentil or gentleman. Humani nihil a me alienum puto says the Stoic. ‘Do as you would be done by,’ says Jesus. ‘Humanity is to be preserved,’ says Locke. 4 All the practical principles behind the Innovator’s case for posterity, or society, or the species, are there from the way 39"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"time immemorial in the Ta o . But they are nowhere else. Unless you accept these without question as being to the world of action what axioms are to the world of theory, you can have no practical principles whatever. You cannot reach them as conclusions: they are premisses. You may, since they can give no ‘rea- son’ for themselves of a kind to silence Gaius and Titius, regard them as sentiments: but then you must give up contrasting ‘real’ or ‘rational’ value with senti- mental value. All value will be sentimental; and you must confess (on pain of abandoning every value) that all sentiment is not ‘merely’ subjective. You may, on the other hand, regard them as rational—nay as ratio- nality itself—as things so obviously reasonable that they neither demand nor admit proof. But then you must allow that Reason can be practical, that an ought must not be dismissed because it cannot produce some is as its credential. If nothing is self-evident, nothing can be proved. Similarly if nothing is obliga- tory for its own sake, nothing is obligatory at all. To some it will appear that I have merely restored under another name what they always meant by basic the abolition of man 40"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"or fundamental instinct. But much more than a choice of words is involved. The Innovator attacks traditional values (the Ta o ) in defence of what he at first supposes to be (in some special sense) ‘rational’ or ‘biological’ values. But as we have seen, all the values which he uses in attacking the Ta o , and even claims to be substi- tuting for it, are themselves derived from the Ta o . If he had really started from scratch, from right outside the human tradition of value, no jugglery could have advanced him an inch towards the conception that a man should die for the community or work for pos- terity. If the Ta o falls, all his own conceptions of value fall with it. Not one of them can claim any aut hority other than that of the Ta o . Only by such shreds of the Ta o as he has inherited is he enabled even to att ack it. The question therefore arises what title he has to select bits of it for acceptance and to reject others. For if the bits he rejects have no authority, neither have those he retains: if what he retains is valid, what he rejects is equally valid too. The Innovator, for example, rates high the claims of posterity. He cannot get any valid claim for the way 41"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"posterity out of instinct or (in the modern sense) reason. He is really deriving our duty to posterity from the Ta o ; our duty to do good to all men is an axiom of Practical Reason, and our duty to do good to our descendants is a clear deduction from it. But then, in every form of the Ta o which has come down to us, side by side with the duty to children and descendants lies the duty to parents and ancestors. By what right do we reject one and accept the other? Again, the Innovator may place economic value first. To get people fed and clothed is the great end, and in pursuit of its scruples about justice and good faith may be set aside. The Tao of course agrees with him about the importance of getting the people fed and clothed. Unless the Innovator were himself using the Ta o he could never have learned of such a duty. But side by side with it in the Ta o lie those duties of justice and good faith which he is ready to debunk. What is his warrant? He may be a Jingoist, a Racialist, an extreme nationalist, who maintains that the advancement of his own people is the object to which all else ought to yield. But no kind of fac- the abolition of man 42"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"tual observation and no appeal to instinct will give him a ground for this option. Once more, he is in fact deriving it from the Ta o : a duty to our own kin, because they are our own kin, is a part of traditional morality. But side by side with it in the Ta o , and lim- iting it, lie the inflexible demands of justice, and the rule that, in the long run, all men are our brothers. Whence comes the Innovator’s authority to pick and choose? Since I can see no answer to these questions, I draw the following conclusions. This thing which I have called for convenience the Ta o , and which oth- ers may call Natural Law or Traditional Morality or the First Principles of Practical Reason or the First Platitudes, is not one among a series of possible sys- tems of value. It is the sole source of all value judge- ments. If it is rejected, all value is rejected. If any value is retained, it is retained. The effort to refute it and raise a new system of value in its place is self- contradictory. There has never been, and never will be, a radically new judgement of value in the history of the world. What purport to be new systems or (as the way 43"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"they now call them) ‘ideologies’, all consist of frag- ments from the Ta o itself, arbitrarily wrenched from their context in the whole and then swollen to mad- ness in their isolation, yet still owing to the Ta o and to it alone such validity as they possess. If my duty to my parents is a superstition, then so is my duty to posterity. If justice is a superstition, then so is my duty to my country or my race. If the pursuit of sci- entific knowledge is a real value, then so is conjugal fidelity. The rebellion of new ideologies against the Ta o is a rebellion of the branches against the tree: if the rebels could succeed they would find that they had destroyed themselves. The human mind has no more power of inventing a new value than of imag- ining a new primary colour, or, indeed, of creating a new sun and a new sky for it to move in. Does this mean, then, that no progress in our per- ceptions of value can ever take place? That we are bound down for ever to an unchanging code given once for all? And is it, in any event, possible to talk of obeying what I call the Ta o ? If we lump together, as I have done, the traditional moralities of East and the abolition of man 44"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"West, the Christian, the Pagan, and the Jew, shall we not find many contradictions and some absurdities? I admit all this. Some criticism, some removal of con- tradictions, even some real development, is required. But there are two very different kinds of criticism. A theorist about language may approach his native tongue, as it were from outside, regarding its genius as a thing that has no claim on him and advo- cating wholesale alterations of its idiom and spelling in the interests of commercial convenience or scien- tific accuracy. That is one thing. A great poet, who has ‘loved, and been well nurtured in, his mother tongue’, may also make great alterations in it, but his changes of the language are made in the spirit of the language itself: he works from within. The language which suffers, has also inspired the changes. That is a different thing—as different as the works of Shakespeare are from Basic English. It is the differ- ence between alteration from within and alteration from without: between the organic and the surgical. In the same way, the Ta o admits development from within. There is a difference between a real the way 45"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"moral advance and a mere innovation. From the Confucian ‘Do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you’ to the Christian ‘Do as you would be done by’ is a real advance. The moral- ity of Nietzsche is a mere innovation. The first is an advance because no one who did not admit the validity of the old maxim could see reason for accepting the new one, and anyone who accepted the old would at once recognize the new as an exten- sion of the same principle. If he rejected it, he would have to reject it as a superfluity, something that went too far, not as something simply heterogeneous from his own ideas of value. But the Nietzschean ethic can be accepted only if we are ready to scrap traditional morals as a mere error and then to put ourselves in a position where we can find no ground for any value judgements at all. It is the difference between a man who says to us: ‘You like your veg- etables moderately fresh; why not grow your own and have them perfectly fresh?’ and a man who says, ‘Throw away that loaf and try eating bricks and cen- tipedes instead.’ the abolition of man 46"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Those who understand the spirit of the Ta o and who have been led by that spirit can modify it in directions which that spirit itself demands. Only they can know what those directions are. The out- sider knows nothing about the matter. His attempts at alteration, as we have seen, contradict themselves. So far from being able to harmonize discrepancies in its letter by penetration to its spirit, he merely snatches at some one precept, on which the acci dents of time and place happen to have riveted his atten- tion, and then rides it to death—for no reason that he can give. From within the Ta o itself comes the only authority to modify the Ta o . This is what Confucius meant when he said ‘With those who follow a differ- ent Way it is useless to take counsel’. 5 This is why Aristotle said that only those who have been well brought up can usefully study ethics: to the cor- rupted man, the man who stands outside the Ta o , the very starting point of this science is invisible. 6 He may be hostile, but he cannot be critical: he does not know what is being discussed. This is why it was also said ‘This people that knoweth not the Law is the way 47"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"accursed’ 7 and ‘He that believeth not shall be damned’. 8 An open mind, in questions that are not ultimate, is useful. But an open mind about the ulti- mate foundations either of Theoretical or of Practical Reason is idiocy. If a man’s mind is open on these things, let his mouth at least be shut. He can say nothing to the purpose. Outside the Ta o there is no ground for criticizing either the Ta o or anything else. In particular instances it may, no doubt, be a mat- ter of some delicacy to decide where the legitimate internal criticism ends and the fatal external kind begins. But wherever any precept of traditional morality is simply challenged to produce its creden- tials, as though the burden of proof lay on it, we have taken the wrong position. The legitimate reformer endeavours to show that the precept in question conflicts with some precept which its defenders allow to be more fundamental, or that it does not really embody the judgement of value it professes to embody. The direct frontal attack ‘Why?’—‘What good does it do?’—‘Who said so?’ is never permissible; not because it is harsh or offen- the abolition of man 48"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"sive but because no values at all can justify them- selves on that level. If you persist in that kind of trial you will destroy all values, and so destroy the bases of your own criticism as well as the thing criticized. You must not hold a pistol to the head of the Ta o . Nor must we postpone obedience to a precept until its credentials have been examined. Only those who are practising the Tao will understand it. It is the well-nurtured man, the cuor gentil , and he alone, who can recognize Reason when it comes. 9 It is Paul, the Pharisee, the man ‘perfect as touching the Law’ who learns where and how that Law was deficient. 10 In order to avoid misunderstanding, I may add that though I myself am a Theist, and indeed a Christian, I am not here attempting any indirect argument for Theism. I am simply arguing that if we are to have values at all we must accept the ultimate platitudes of Practical Reason as having absolute validity: that any attempt, having become sceptical about these, to reintroduce value lower down on some supposedly more ‘realistic’ basis, is doomed.

We know already in principle how such things are pro- duced: soon we shall know in detail: eventually we shall be able to produce them at will. Of course, while we did not know how minds were made, we accepted this mental furniture as a datum, even as a master. But many things in nature which were once our masters have become our servants. Why not this? Why must our conquest of nature stop short, in stupid rever- ence, before this final and toughest bit of ‘nature’ which has hitherto been called the conscience of man?

Having mastered our environment, let us now master ourselves and choose our own destiny.

In their context the words had a certain tragic beauty, for the speaker was dying of tuberculosis. ‘No matter,’ he said, ‘I know I’m one of the casualties. Of course there are casualties on the winning as well as on the losing side. But that doesn’t alter the fact that it is winning.’ I have chosen this story as my point of departure in order to make it clear that I do not wish to disparage all that is really 53"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"beneficial in the process described as ‘Man’s con- quest’, much less all the real devotion and self-sacri- fice that has gone to make it possible. But having done so I must proceed to analyse this conception a little more closely. In what sense is Man the posses- sor of increasing power over Nature? Let us consider three typical examples: the aero- plane, the wireless, and the contraceptive. In a civi- lized community, in peace-time, anyone who can pay for them may use these things. But it cannot strictly be said that when he does so he is exercising his own proper or individual power over Nature. If I pay you to carry me, I am not therefore myself a strong man. Any or all of the three things I have mentioned can be withheld from some men by other men—by those who sell, or those who allow the sale, or those who own the sources of production, or those who make the goods. What we call Man’s power is, in reality, a power possessed by some men which they may, or may not, allow other men to profit by. Again, as regards the powers manifested in the aeroplane or the wireless, Man is as much the the abolition of man 54"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"patient or subject as the possessor, since he is the tar- get both for bombs and for propaganda. And as regards contraceptives, there is a paradoxical, nega- tive sense in which all possible future generations are the patients or subjects of a power wielded by those already alive. By contraception simply, they are denied existence; by contraception used as a means of selective breeding, they are, without their concur- ring voice, made to be what one generation, for its own reasons, may choose to prefer. From this point of view, what we call Man’s power over Nature turns out to be a power exercised by some men over other men with Nature as its instrument. It is, of course, a commonplace to complain that men have hitherto used badly, and against their fel- lows, the powers that science has given them. But that is not the point I am trying to make. I am not speaking of particular corruptions and abuses which an increase of moral virtue would cure: I am consid- ering what the thing called ‘Man’s power over Nature’ must always and essentially be. No doubt, the picture could be modified by public ownership the abolition of man 55"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"of raw materials and factories and public control of scientific research. But unless we have a world state this will still mean the power of one nation over oth- ers. And even within the world state or the nation it will mean (in principle) the power of majorities over minorities, and (in the concrete) of a government over the people. And all long-term exercises of power, especially in breeding, must mean the power of earlier generations over later ones. The latter point is not always sufficiently empha- sized, because those who write on social matters have not yet learned to imitate the physicists by always including Time among the dimensions. In order to understand fully what Man’s power over Nature, and therefore the power of some men over other men, really means, we must picture the race extended in time from the date of its emergence to that of its extinction. Each generation exercises power over its successors: and each, in so far as it modifies the environment bequeathed to it and rebels against tra- dition, resists and limits the power of its predeces- sors. This modifies the picture which is sometimes the abolition of man 56"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"painted of a progressive emancipation from tradition and a progressive control of natural processes result- ing in a continual increase of human power. In reality, of course, if any one age really attains, by eugenics and scientific education, the power to make its descendants what it pleases, all men who live after it are the patients of that power. They are weaker, not stronger: for though we may have put wonderful machines in their hands we have pre-ordained how they are to use them. And if, as is almost certain, the age which had thus attained maximum power over posterity were also the age most emancipated from tradition, it would be engaged in reducing the power of its predecessors almost as drastically as that of its successors. And we must also remember that, quite apart from this, the later a generation comes—the nearer it lives to that date at which the species becomes extinct—the less power it will have in the forward direction, because its subjects will be so few. There is therefore no question of a power vested in the race as a whole steadily growing as long as the race survives. The last men, far from being the heirs of the abolition of man 57"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"power, will be of all men most subject to the dead hand of the great planners and conditioners and will themselves exercise least power upon the future. The real picture is that of one dominant age—let us suppose the hundredth century a.d. —which resists all previous ages most successfully and domi- nates all subsequent ages most irresistibly, and thus is the real master of the human species. But then within this master generation (itself an infinitesimal minor- ity of the species) the power will be exercised by a minority smaller still. Man’s conquest of Nature, if the dreams of some scientific planners are realized, means the rule of a few hundreds of men over bil- lions upon billions of men. There neither is nor can be any simple increase of power on Man’s side. Each new power won by man is a power over man as well. Each advance leaves him weaker as well as stronger.

The final stage is come when Man by eugenics, by pre-natal conditioning, and by an education and propaganda based on a perfect applied psychology, has obtained full control over himself. Human nature will be the last part of Nature to surrender to Man. The battle will then be won. We shall have ‘taken the thread of life out of the hand of Clotho’ and be henceforth free to make our species whatever we wish it to be. The battle will indeed be won. But who, precisely, will have won it? For the power of Man to make himself what he pleases means, as we have seen, the power of some men to make other men what they please. In all ages, no doubt, nurture and instruction have, in some sense, attempted to exercise this power. But the situ- ation to which we must look forward will be novel in two respects. In the first place, the power will be enormously increased.

But the man- moulders of the new age will be armed with the pow- ers of an omnicompetent state and an irresistible scientific technique: we shall get at last a race of con- ditioners who really can cut out all posterity in what shape they please. The second difference is even more important. In the older systems both the kind of man the teachers wished to produce and their motives for producing him were prescribed by the Ta o —a norm to which the teachers themselves were subject and from which they claimed no liberty to depart.

Other, more simple-minded, critics may ask, ‘Why should you suppose they will be such bad men?’ But I am not supposing them to be bad men. They are, rather, not men (in the old sense) at all. They are, if you like, men who have sacrificed their own share in traditional humanity in order to devote themselves to the task of deciding what ‘Humanity’ shall henceforth mean. ‘Good’ and ‘bad’, applied to them, are words without content: for it is from them that the content of these words is henceforward to be derived. Nor is their dif- ficulty factitious. We might suppose that it was possi- ble to say ‘After all, most of us want more or less the same things—food and drink and sexual intercourse, amusement, art, science, and the longest possible life for individuals and for the species.

In the first place, it is false that we all really like the same things. But even if we did, what motive is to impel the Conditioners to scorn delights and live laborious days in order that we, and posterity, may have what we like? Their duty? But that is only the Ta o , which they may decide to impose on us, but which cannot be valid for them. If they accept it, then they are no longer the makers of conscience but still its subjects, and their final conquest over Nature has not really happened. The preservation of the species? But why should the species be preserved? One of the questions before them is whether this feeling for posterity (they know well how it is produced) shall be continued or not. However far they go back, or down, they can find no ground to stand on. Every motive they try to act on becomes at once a petitio . It is not that they are bad men. They are not men at all. Stepping outside the Ta o , they have stepped into the void. Nor are their subjects necessarily unhappy men. They are not men at all: they are artefacts.

When I said just now that all motives fail them, I should have said all motives except one. All motives that claim any valid- ity other than that of their felt emotional weight at a given moment have failed them. Everything except the sic volo , sic jubeo has been explained away. But what never claimed objectivity cannot be destroyed by subjectivism. The impulse to scratch when I itch or to pull to pieces when I am inquisitive is immune from the solvent which is fatal to my justice, or hon- our, or care for posterity. When all that says ‘it is good’ has been debunked, what says ‘I want’ remains. It cannot be exploded or ‘seen through’ because it never had any pretentions. The Con- ditioners, therefore, must come to be motivated sim- ply by their own pleasure. I am not here speaking of the corrupting influence of power nor expressing the fear that under it our Conditioners will degenerate.

We may legitimately hope that among the impulses which arise in minds thus emptied of all ‘rational’ or ‘spiritual’ motives, some will be be- nevolent.

I am very doubtful whether history shows us one example of a man who, having stepped out- side traditional morality and attained power, has used that power benevolently. I am inclined to think that the Conditioners will hate the conditioned. Though regarding as an illusion the artificial con- science which they produce in us their subjects, they will yet perceive that it creates in us an illusion of meaning for our lives which compares favourably with the futility of their own: and they will envy us as eunuchs envy men.

For without the judgement ‘Benevolence is good’—that is, without re-entering the Ta o —they can have no ground for promoting or stabilizing these impulses rather than any others. By the logic of their position they must just take their impulses as they come, from chance. And Chance here means Nature. It is from heredity, digestion, the weather, and the association of ideas, that the motives of the Conditioners will spring. Their extreme ratio- nalism, by ‘seeing through’ all ‘rational’ motives, leaves them creatures of wholly irrational behaviour. If you will not obey the Ta o , or else commit suicide, obedience to impulse (and therefore, in the long run, to mere ‘nature’) is the only course left open.

Man’s conquest of Nature turns out, in the moment of its consummation, to be Nature’s con- quest of Man. Every victory we seemed to win has led us, step by step, to this conclusion. All Nature’s apparent reverses have been but tactical withdrawals. We thought we were beating her back when she was luring us on. What looked to us like hands held up in surrender was really the opening of arms to enfold us for ever. If the fully planned and conditioned world (with its Ta o a mere product of the planning) comes into existence, Nature will be troubled no more by the restive species that rose in revolt against her so many millions of years ago, will be vexed no longer by its chatter of truth and mercy and beauty and hap- piness. Ferum victorem cepit : and if the eugenics are efficient enough there will be no second revolt, but all snug beneath the Conditioners, and the Conditioners beneath her, till the moon falls or the sun grows cold. My point may be clearer to some if it is put in a different form. Nature is a word of varying mean- ings, which can best be understood if we consider its the abolition of man 68"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"various opposites. The Natural is the opposite of the Artificial, the Civil, the Human, the Spiritual, and the Supernatural. The Artificial does not now con- cern us. If we take the rest of the list of opposites, however, I think we can get a rough idea of what men have meant by Nature and what it is they oppose to her. Nature seems to be the spatial and temporal, as distinct from what is less fully so or not so at all. She seems to be the world of quantity, as against the world of quality; of objects as against consciousness; of the bound, as against the wholly or partially autonomous; of that which knows no values as against that which both has and perceives value; of efficient causes (or, in some modern systems, of no causality at all) as against final causes. Now I take it that when we understand a thing analytically and then dominate and use it for our own convenience, we reduce it to the level of ‘Nature’ in the sense that we suspend our judgements of value about it, ignore its final cause (if any), and treat it in terms of quantity. This repression of elements in what would otherwise be our total reaction to it is sometimes the abolition of man 69"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"very noticeable and even painful: something has to be overcome before we can cut up a dead man or a live animal in a dissecting room. These objects resist the movement of the mind whereby we thrust them into the world of mere Nature. But in other instances too, a similar price is exacted for our analytical knowledge and manipulative power, even if we have ceased to count it. We do not look at trees either as Dryads or as beautiful objects while we cut them into beams: the first man who did so may have felt the price keenly, and the bleeding trees in Virgil and Spenser may be far-off echoes of that primeval sense of impiety. The stars lost their divinity as astronomy developed, and the Dying God has no place in chem- ical agriculture. To many, no doubt, this process is simply the gradual discovery that the real world is different from what we expected, and the old oppo- sition to Galileo or to ‘body-snatchers’ is simply obscurantism. But that is not the whole story. It is not the greatest of modern scientists who feel most sure that the object, stripped of its qualitative prop- erties and reduced to mere quantity, is wholly real. the abolition of man 70"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Little scientists, and little unscientific followers of science, may think so. The great minds know very well that the object, so treated, is an artificial abstrac- tion, that something of its reality has been lost. From this point of view the conquest of Nature appears in a new light. We reduce things to mere Nature in order that we may ‘conquer’ them. We are always conquering Nature, because ‘Nature’ is the name for what we have, to some extent, conquered. The price of conquest is to treat a thing as mere Nature. Every conquest over Nature increases her domain. The stars do not become Nature till we can weigh and measure them: the soul does not become Nature till we can psychoanalyse her. The wresting of powers from Nature is also the surrendering of things to Nature. As long as this process stops short of the final stage we may well hold that the gain out- weighs the loss. But as soon as we take the final step of reducing our own species to the level of mere Nature, the whole process is stultified, for this time the being who stood to gain and the being who has been sacrificed are one and the same.

It is like the famous Irishman who found that a certain kind of stove reduced his fuel bill by half and thence concluded that two stoves of the same kind would enable him to warm his house with no fuel at all. It is the magician’s bargain: give up our soul, get power in return. But once our souls, that is, our- selves, have been given up, the power thus conferred will not belong to us. We shall in fact be the slaves and puppets of that to which we have given our souls. It is in Man’s power to treat himself as a mere ‘natural object’ and his own judgements of value as raw material for scientific manipulation to alter at will. The objection to his doing so does not lie in the fact that this point of view (like one’s first day in a dissecting room) is painful and shocking till we grow used to it. The pain and the shock are at most a warn- ing and a symptom. The real objection is that if man chooses to treat himself as raw material, raw material he will be: not raw material to be manipulated, as he fondly imagined, by himself, but by mere appetite, the abolition of man 72"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"that is, mere Nature, in the person of his de-human- ized Conditioners.

A dogmatic belief in objective value is necessary to the very idea of a rule which is not tyranny or an obedience which is not slavery.

Nothing I can say will prevent some people from describing this lecture as an attack on science.

The fact that the scientist has suc- ceeded where the magician failed has put such a wide contrast between them in popular thought that the real story of the birth of Science is misunderstood. You will even find people who write about the six- teenth century as if Magic were a medieval survival and Science the new thing that came in to sweep it away. Those who have studied the period know bet- ter. There was very little magic in the Middle Ages: the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are the high noon of magic. The serious magical endeavour and the serious scientific endeavour are twins: one was sickly and died, the other strong and throve. But they were twins. They were born of the same impulse. I allow that some (certainly not all) of the early scientists were actuated by a pure love of knowledge. But if we consider the temper of that age the abolition of man 76"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"as a whole we can discern the impulse of which I speak. There is something which unites magic and applied science while separating both from the ‘wis- dom’ of earlier ages. For the wise men of old the car- dinal problem had been how to conform the soul to reality, and the solution had been knowledge, self- discipline, and virtue. For magic and applied science alike the problem is how to subdue reality to the wishes of men: the solution is a technique; and both, in the practice of this technique, are ready to do things hitherto regarded as disgusting and impious— such as digging up and mutilating the dead. If we compare the chief trumpeter of the new era (Bacon) with Marlowe’s Faustus, the similarity is striking. You will read in some critics that Faustus has a thirst for knowledge. In reality, he hardly men- tions it. It is not truth he wants from the devils, but gold and guns and girls. ‘All things that move between the quiet poles shall be at his command’ and ‘a sound magician is a mighty god’. 3 In the same spirit Bacon condemns those who value knowledge the abolition of man 77"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"as an end in itself: this, for him, is to use as a mistress for pleasure what ought to be a spouse for fruit. 4 The true object is to extend Man’s power to the perfor- mance of all things possible.

No doubt those who really founded modern science were usually those whose love of truth exceeded their love of power; in every mixed movement the efficacy comes from the good elements not from the bad. But the presence of the bad elements is not irrelevant to the direction the efficacy takes. It might be going too far to say that the modern scientific movement was tainted from its birth: but I think it would be true to say that it was born in an unhealthy neighbourhood and at an inauspicious hour. Its triumphs may have been too rapid and purchased at too high a price: reconsidera- tion, and something like repentance, may be required.

I hardly know what I am asking for. I hear rumours that Goethe’s approach to nature deserves fuller consideration—that even Dr Steiner may have seen something that orthodox researchers have missed.

When it spoke of the parts it would remember the whole. While studying the It it would not lose what Martin Buber calls the Thou -situation.

Perhaps, in the nature of things, analytical understanding must always be a basilisk which kills what it sees and only sees by killing.

What I most fear is the reply that I am ‘only one more’ obscurantist, that this barrier, like all pre- vious barriers set up against the advance of science, can be safely passed. Such a reply springs from the fatal serialism of the modern imagination—the image of infinite unilinear progression which so haunts our minds.

De Planctu Naturae Prosa , iii. 2 The Way 1 The real (perhaps unconscious) philosophy of Gaius and Titius becomes clear if we contrast the two following lists of disapprovals and approvals. A. Disapprovals : A mother’s appeal to a child to be ‘brave’ is ‘nonsense’ ( Green Book , p. 62 ). The reference of the word ‘gentleman’ is ‘extremely vague’ (ibid.) ‘To call a man a coward tells us really nothing about what he does’ (p. 64 ). Feelings about a country or empire are feelings ‘about nothing in particular’ (p. 77 ). B. Approvals : Those who prefer the arts of peace to the arts of war (it is not said in what circum- stances) are such that ‘we may want to call them notes 105"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"wise men’ (p. 65 ). The pupil is expected ‘to believe in a democractic community life’ (p. 67 ). ‘Contact with the ideas of other people is, as we know, healthy’ (p. 86 ). The reason for bathrooms (‘that people are healthier and pleasanter to meet when they are clean’) is ‘too obvious to need mentioning’ (p. 142 ). It will be seen that comfort and security, as known to a suburban street in peace-time, are the ultimate values: those things which can alone produce or spiritualize comfort and security are mocked. Man lives by bread alone, and the ultimate source of bread is the baker’s van: peace matters more than honour and can be preserved by jeering at colonels and read- ing newspapers. 2 The most determined effort which I know to construct a theory of value on the basis of ‘satis- faction of impulses’ is that of Dr I. A. Richards ( Principles of Literary Criticism , 1924 ). The old objection to defining Value as Satisfaction is the universal value judgement that ‘it is better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a pig satisfied’. To meet notes 106"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"this Dr Richards endeavours to show that our impulses can be arranged in a hierarchy and some satisfactions preferred to others without an appeal to any criterion other than satisfaction. He does this by the doctrine that some impulses are more ‘important’ than others—an important impulse being one whose frustration involves the frustration of other impulses. A good systemati- zation (i.e. the good life) consists in satisfying as many impulses as possible; which entails satisfy- ing the ‘important’ at the expense of the ‘unim- portant’. The objections to this scheme seem to me to be two: ( 1 ) Without a theory of immortality it leaves no room for the value of noble death. It may, of course, be said that a man who has saved his life by treachery will suffer for the rest of that life from frustration. But not, surely, frustration of all his impulses? Whereas the dead man will have no satisfaction. Or is it maintained that since he had no unsatisfied impulses he is better off than the disgraced notes 107"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"and living man? This at once raises the second objection. ( 2 ) Is the value of a systematization to be judged by the presence of satisfactions or the absence of dissatisfactions? The extreme case is that of the dead man in whom satisfactions and dissatisfactions (on the modern view) both equal zero, as against the successful traitor who can still eat, drink, sleep, scratch and copulate, even if he cannot have friend- ship or love or self-respect. But it arises at other levels. Suppose A has only 500 impulses and all are satisfied, and that B has 1200 impulses whereof 700 are satisfied and 500 not: which has the better systematiza- tion? There is no doubt which Dr Richards actually prefers—he even praises art on the ground that it makes us ‘discontented’ with ordinary crudities! (op. cit., p. 230 ). The only trace I find of a philosophical basis for this preference is the statement that ‘the more complex an activity the more conscious it is’ notes 108"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"(p. 109 ). But if satisfaction is the only value, why should increase of consciousness be good? For consciousness is the condition of all dissastisfactions as well as of all satisfac- tions. Dr Richards’s system gives no support to his (and our) actual preference for civil life over savage and human over animal—or even for life over death. 3 The desperate expedients to which a man can be driven if he attempts to base value on fact are well illustrated by Dr C. H. Waddington’s fate in Science and Ethics . Dr Waddington here explains that ‘existence is its own justification’ (p. 14 ), and writes: ‘An existence which is essentially evolu- tionary is itself the justification for an evolution towards a more comprehensive existence’ (p. 17 ). I do not think Dr Waddington is himself at ease in this view, for he does endeavour to recom- mend the course of evolution to us on three grounds other than its mere occurrence. ( a ) That the later stages include or ‘comprehend’ the ear- lier. ( b ) That T. H. Huxley’s picture of Evolution notes 109"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"will not revolt you if you regard it from an ‘actu- arial’ point of view. ( c ) That, any way, after all, it isn’t half so bad as people make out (‘not so morally offensive that we cannot accept it’, p. 18 ). These three palliatives are more creditable to Dr Waddington’s heart than his head and seem to me to give up the main position. If Evolution is praised (or, at least, apologized for) on the ground of any properties it exhibits, then we are using an external standard and the attempt to make existence its own justification has been abandoned. If that attempt is maintained, why does Dr Waddington concentrate on Evolution: i.e. on a temporary phase of organic existence in one planet? This is ‘geocentric’. If Good = ‘what- ever Nature happens to be doing’, then surely we should notice what Nature is doing as a whole; and Nature as a whole, I understand, is working steadily and irreversibly towards the final extinc- tion of all life in every part of the universe, so that Dr Waddington’s ethics, stripped of their unaccountable bias towards such a parochial notes 110"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"affair as tellurian biology, would leave murder and suicide our only duties. Even this, I confess, seems to me a lesser objection than the discrep- ancy between Dr Waddington’s first principle and the value judgements men actually make. To value anything simply because it occurs is in fact to worship success, like Quislings or men of Vichy. Other philosophies more wicked have been devised: none more vulgar. I am far from suggesting that Dr Waddington practises in real life such grovelling prostration before the fait accompli . Let us hope that Rasselas , chap. 22 , gives the right picture of what his philosophy amounts to in action.
