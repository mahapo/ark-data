Th u nder reverberated from a storm of Rus sian artillery that was bom - barding the ruined capital. Th e d ay before, along with the incoming shells, came particularly bad news for the fuehrer, who by this late date in World War II was confined to his underground bunker beneath the Reich chan - cellery. Hitler had learned that two days earlier his Axis partner, Italy’s Fa scist dictator Benito Mussolini, had been captured by paramilitary Ital - ian re sis tance fi g hters. Mussolini and his mistress, Clara Petacci, were ex - ecuted and their bodies were left hanging from lampposts in a Milan p iazza. Th is news was especially worrisome to Hitler because only hours earlier he had married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony inside the Fuehrerbunker . Hitler had previously vowed never to be captured alive, and reiterated t o his entourage that neither he nor his new bride would be made a “spec - tacle, presented by the Jews, to divert their hysterical masses.” He made o bvious preparations for the end of his reign. He handed out poison cap - sules to his remaining female secretaries and had Blondi, his favorite Alsa - tian dog, poisoned. Two other house hold dogs were shot. Dictating a last will, he stated, “I myself and my wife—in order to"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"2 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH escape the disgrace of deposition or capitulation—choose death.” He or - dered that their bodies be burned immediately. But Hitler, decorated W orld War I soldier and hardened political fighter, made it clear that he and his philosophies would not leave the world stage quietly. He added, “From the sacrifi ce of our soldiers and from my own unity with them unto death will in any case spring up in the history of Germany the seed of a radiant renais sance of the National Socialist movement and thus of the realization of a true community of nations.” Hitler then passed along a line of his entourage, mostly women, and s hook their hands while mumbling inaudibly. Frau Traudl Junge, one of the secretaries present, recalled that Hitler’s eyes “seemed to be looking far away, beyond the walls of the bunker.” At about three P. M . on April 30, members of Hitler’s entourage heard a single shot from their leader’s quarters. Some time later, Hitler’s valet, SS Sturmbannfuehrer Heinz Linge, and an orderly emerged with a blanket-covered body. Martin Bormann, Hitler’s private secretary, head of the Nazi Party and the most powerful man in the Reich aft er Hit ler, followed with the body of a woman. Th e corpses were carried up to a gar - den area, placed in a shell crater, and burned with gasoline. However, t hese remains were never found, reportedly due to the constant shelling. By evening, a Soviet fl a g was fl ying atop the Reichstag. It appeared that Hitler and his Th ird Reich were finished. T HE E SC A P E OF A DO L F H IT LER It was well known and publicly reported that Hitler oft en made use of doubles, men who closely resembled him, for use at certain public pre sen - tations. Pauline Koehler, a maid at Hitler’s Berghof in Berchtesgaden, in - sisted that she knew of at least three men who doubled for Hitler. Did Hitler make use of one fi nal double in the bunker? Aft er all, the few persons who testifi ed that he was dead were ardent Nazis who were ea - ger to please their captors—whether Rus sian, British, or American—with acc ounts of the leader’s death. Was the strange execution of Eva Braun’s brother-in-law, Hermann Fegelein, due to his knowledge of Hitler’s escape"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"3 INTRODUCTION plan with the use of a double? Fegelein had left the bunker but protested when captured by an SS search party that he planned to return. He was later shot by a firing squad in the chancellery garden for desertion. Yet, days earlier, Hitler had urged others in the bunker to fl ee. “Get out! Get out!” he cried. “Go to South Germany. I’ll stay here. It is all over anyhow.” Why make Fegelein the exception? Evidence that Fegelein was privy to secret knowledge comes from Kris - tina Reiman, an actress who met with Fegelein in Berlin on April 27. She t old author Glenn B. Infi eld, “He was very worried. We had several drinks together and he kept repeating that there were two Hitlers in Berlin . . . . I t hought he was drunk. Just before he left me, however, he said that if the fuehrer ever discovered that he, Fegelein, knew his secret, Hitler would kill him.” To fake Hitler’s death would have been simple. A Hitler double could ha ve been secreted into the bunker any time prior to his reported suicide. Aft er Hitler got Eva to take poison—or a dead duplicate Eva brought in—the double, dressed in the fuehrer’s clothing, could have been shot, a poison capsule placed in his mouth, and left to be covered by Bormann and retrieved by the unsuspecting valet Linge. Hitler could have then passed from the study through his living quar - ters to a small conference room containing a stairway to the garden above. H itler had instructed Linge to wait “at least ten minutes before entering the room.” While Linge and others from the entourage waited in the hall - way outside Hitler’s study, the fuehrer’s party and an armed SS escort c ould have made their way to a secluded spot to await darkness. Under the cover of night, Hitler could have moved along Hermann G oering Strasse, then cut across the Tiergarten to the Zoo Station near Adolf Hitler Platz. From there, they could have followed the rail lines to the Reichssportfeld and crossed the Scharndorfestrasse to the Piechelsdorf Bridge, a short walk to the Havel River, where a Ju-52 fl oatplane would have been waiting to fl y the fuehrer out. Indeed a Ju-52 pontoon plane had landed on the Havel the previous n ight, at the radioed request of someone in the Fuehrerbunker . It took off that same night. Author Infi eld has suspected this was a practice run for the following night."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"4 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Once away from Berlin, an airplane could have taken Hitler almost anywhere in territory not under direct control of the Allies—Switzerland, Spain, or any number of other friendly locations. But did this happen? Conventional history says that Hitler and Eva Braun committed sui - cide in the bunker—end of story, despite tantalizing tidbits of infor - mation that have surfaced since the war. On July 17, 1945, during the P otsdam Conference, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin reportedly told U.S. president Harry S. Truman that Hitler did not commit suicide but prob - ably escaped. Years later, the Rus sians produced photos purporting to be o f Hitler’s dead body, which contradicted their earlier accounts that the bodies of Hitler and his mistress had been immediately burned. Today, while Hitler’s fate may be intriguing and undoubtedly will be a rgued for years, it is immaterial, a moot point. What is certain is that Hitler’s legacy—National Socialism—lives on. T H E HIS TORY OF how the Nazis, armed with advanced technology and the greatest hoard of treasure in history, were able to escape justice at the end of World War II is perhaps the greatest untold story of the twentieth century. From the days of Lyndon B. Johnson to those of George W. Bush, there ha s been talk of “Amerika” turning “fascist.” Most people, this author in - cluded, dismissed this as radical rhetoric. Unfortunately, as shall be seen, t his might not be so far from the truth. Th e G ermans were defeated in World War II . . . but not the Nazis. Th ey were simply forced to move. Th ey scattered to the four corners of the world. Many of them came to the United States and penetrated what President Dwight D. Eisenhower termed “the military-industrial com - plex.” Th e y escaped with the loot of Europe as well as rocket science and even more exotic technologies. Some of this technolog y was so advanced that it remains classifi ed in U.S. government files even today.

Th eir agenda matches that of the old Bavarian Illuminati, who were long thought to have perished soon aft er the time of George Washington. But if the order died, its credo lives on—power and control through wealth by any means possible. From the seeds of Nazism planted in America during the Cold War sprang a whole new nation, one that today has become the greatest superpower in history but has also incurred a growing hatred among the nations of the world as well as alienation and dissension among its own citizens. At the beginning of the third millennium aft er Ch rist, by most criteria, the once-free constitutional republic of the United States had become a National Socialist nation, an empire of the creators of the Th ird Reich—a Fourth Reich. If this assessment seems harsh and unbelievable, read on. Be advised that this work has no political conviction to advocate, no conspir - acy theory to press, and no hidden agenda. It is a collection of supportable facts tha t leads to certain conclusions, uncomfortable and unconventional as they may be. But first, one must understand the definition of the terms under con - sideration. AD EFI NIT I ON OF T ER MS Everyone has heard of Hitler’s Th ird Reich, but what were the First and Second Reichs? Th e F irst Reich is known as the Holy Roman Empire, although it was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire. It was founded by the Frankish king Charles I, called Charlemagne or Charles the Great, who was crowned emperor in 800 A.D. by Pope Leo III aft er conquering and annexing most of Europe, including Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Low Countries, and parts of France, Italy, and Czecho slovaki a. Th is monarchial empire, modeled aft er the Roman Empire and ruled by kaisers, or caesars, existed until 1806, when Napoleon marched his troops into Berlin."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"6 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Th e Second Reich was created by Prince Otto von Bismarck, who as premier of Prus sia defeated Napoleon III in 1871 and became the “Iron Chancellor” over about three hundred independent states. Bismarck’s reich, toward the end headed by Kaiser Wilhelm II, lasted until 1918 and ended with the defeat of the Central Powers of Germany and Austria- Hungary in World War I. With Adolf Hitler’s ascension to power in 1933, he proclaimed Greater G ermany as the Th ird Reich, Reich being the German word for “empire.” Interestingly enough, when used with a lowercase “r,” the word reich means “rich” or “wealthy.” A Reich , therefore, could mean “an empire of the wealthy.” Th e t erm “Nazi” stems from the acronym of “National Socialism.” Th is was derived by combining the first syllable of “NAtional” and the second syllable of “ soZIalist ” in the name Nationalosozialistiche Deutsche Ar - beiterpartei, the National Socialist German Workers Party. Th is w as the small radical political party Hitler built into a fascist system that threat - ened the entire world. Nazism is a philosophy. One recent dictionary de - fines a Nazi as a person “holding extreme racist or authoritarian views or beha ving brutally” or anyone “belonging to any organization similar to the Nazis.” One edition of the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Lan - guage d efined fascism as “a philosophy or system of government that advo - cates or exercises a dictatorship of the extreme right, typically through the m erging of state and business leadership together with an ideology of bel- ligerent nationalism.” Always remember that a typical attribute of fascism is t he merging of state and business leadership. Italian dictator Benito Mussolini is credited with coining the word “ fascism,” a name taken from his fascist Black Shirts called Fascisti . Th is term derived from the ancient Roman symbol of the fasces, a bundle of rods with a protruding axe blade. It was the symbol of central authority. Under fascism, the individual is subordinate to the state, usually headed by a single leader. However, even Mussolini pointed out that “Th e fi rst stage of fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism, because it is the merger"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"7 INTRODUCTION of state and corporate power.” For the remainder of this work, fascism will be defined as the merger of state and corporate power. In fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, the state gained control over the co rporations. In modern America, corporations have gained control over the state. The end result is the same. Mussolini proclaimed, “Th e ma xim that society exists only for the well-being and freedom of the individuals composing it does not seem to be in conformity with nature’s plans . . . . If classical liberalism spells indi - vidualism, fascism spells government.” And Th o mas J. DiLorenzo, professor of economics at Loyola College in Baltimore, Maryland, wrote, “[I]t is important to recognize that, as an economic system, fascism was widely accepted in the 1920s and 30s. Th e evil deeds of individual fascists were later condemned, but the practice of economic fascism never was.” Party politics, slogans, and social issues are employed to distract the ma sses. Th e world’s elite deal in only one commodity—power. Th ey seek to gain and maintain the controlling power that comes from great wealth, usually gained through the monopoly of ownership over basic resources. Politics and social issues matter little to the globalist ruling elite, who move smoothly between corporate business and government service. Th e desire for wealth with its attendant power and control drives their activities. It is this unswerving attention to commerce and banking that lies behind nearly all modern world events. It is the basis for a “New World Order” mentioned by both Hitler and former president George H. W. Bush. In twenty- fi rs t-century America, many thoughtful persons have wit - nessed what appears to be a recycling of the events of pre–World War II G ermany: the destruction of a prominent national structure; rushed emer - gency legislation; the rise of a secretive national security apparatus; at - tempts to register both fi r earms and people, coupled with preemptive wars of aggression propelled by fervent nationalism. Th is ma y be simply a coincidence, some synchronistic cycle of history. But this also may be a covert plan being carried out by individuals follow - ing a definite agenda."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"8 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH C O M M UNISM V E R S U S N AT IONA L S O C I A LISM As documented in Rule by Secrecy, the same financial powers that built the United States into the world’s foremost superpower also created com - munism. Aft e r an aborted revolution in 1905, thousands of Rus sian ac - tivists had been exiled, including the revolutionaries Leon Trotsky and V ladimir Lenin. Aft er years of attempts at reform, the czar was forced to abdicate on March 15, 1917, following riots in Saint-Petersburg believed by many to have been instigated by British agents. In January 1917, Leon Trotsky, a fervent follower of Karl Marx, was l iving rent-free on Standard Oil property in Bayonne, New Jersey. He worked in New York City as a reporter for Th e New World, a communist newspaper. Trotsky had escaped Rus sia in 1905 and fl ed to France, from where he was expelled for his revolutionary behavior. “He soon discovered that there were wealthy Wall Street bankers who were willing to finance a revolution in Rus sia,” wrote journalist William T. Still. One of these bankers was Jacob Schiff, whose family had lived with the R othschild family in Frankfurt, Germany. According to the New York Journal- American, “[I]t is estimated by Jacob’s grandson, John Schiff , that the old man sank about $20 million for the final triumph of Bolshevism in Rus sia.” Schiff , a Rocke feller banker, had financed the Japanese in the 1904–05 Russo-Japanese War for control of Manchuria, and had sent his emissary George Kennan to Rus sia to promote revolution against the czar. Another was Senator Elihu Root, attorney for Federal Reserve c ofound er Paul Warburg’s Kuhn, Loeb & Company. Root, an honorary president of the secretive Council on Foreign Relations and a former U.S. secretary of state, who moved smoothly between government positions and his law practice in New York City, contributed yet another $20 mil - l ion, a ccord i ng to t he cong re ssiona l record of S eptember 2 , 1919. Schiff a nd Root were not alone. Arsene de Goulevitch, who was present during the early days of the Bolsheviks, later wrote, “In private interviews, I have been told that over 21 million rubles were spent by Lord [Alfred] Milner in financing the Rus sian Revolution.” Milner, a German-born British statesman, was the primary force behind Cecil Rhodes’s Round Tables, a pre deces sor of the Council on Foreign Relations. Th e American"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"9 INTRODUCTION International Corporation (AIC), formed in 1915, also helped fund the Rus sian Revolution. AIC directors represented the interests of the Rocke - fellers, Rothschilds, Du Ponts, Kuhns, Loebs, Harrimans, and the Federal R eserve, as well as Federal Reserve cofounder Frank Vanderlip and George Herbert Walker, the maternal great-grandfather of President George W. Bush. Trotsky left t he United States by ship on March 27, 1917—just days before America entered the war—along with nearly three hundred revolu - tionaries and funds provided by Wall Street. Trotsky, whose real name w as Lev Davidovich Bronstein, was being trailed by British agents who suspected him of working with German intelligence since his stay in pre - war Vienna. In a speech before leaving New York, Trotsky stated, “I am go ing back to Rus sia to overthrow the provisional government and stop the war with Germany.” When the ship carrying Trotsky and his entourage stopped in Halifax, N ova Scotia, they and their funds were impounded by Canadian authori - ties, who rightly feared that a revolution in Rus sia might free German tr oops to fi ght their soldiers on the Western Front. But this well- grounded concern was overcome by President Woodrow Wilson’s alter ego, Colonel Edward Mandell House, who told the chief of the British Secret Service, Sir William Wiseman, that Wilson wanted Trotsky released. On April 21, 1917, less than a month aft er the United States entered the war, the British Admiralty ordered the release of Trotsky, who, armed with an American passport authorized by Wilson, continued on his journey to Rus sia and history. At this same time, Lenin also left ex ile. Aided by the Germans and ac - companied by about 150 trained revolutionaries, “[he] was put on the in - famous ‘sealed train’ in Switzerland along with at least $5 million,” a ccording to Still. Th e train passed through Germany unhindered, as ar - ranged by German banker Max Warburg (the brother of Paul Warburg, wh o cofounded the Federal Reserve System and handled U.S. financing during World War I) and the German High Command. Lenin, like Trot - sky, was labeled a German agent by the government of Alexandr Keren - sky, the second provisional government created following the czar’s abd ication. By November 1917, Lenin and Trotsky, backed by Western"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"10 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH funds, had instigated a successful revolt and seized the Rus sian govern - ment for the Bolsheviks. But the communist grip on Rus sia was not secure. Internal strife be - tween the “reds” and the “whites” lasted until 1922 and cost some 28 mil - lion Rus sian lives, many times the war loss. Lenin died in 1924 from a se ries of strokes aft er establishing the Th ird International, or Comintern, an organi zation formed to export communism worldwide. Trotsky fl ed Rus sia when Joseph Stalin took dictatorial control, and, in 1940, was murdered in Mexico by an agent of Stalin’s. Some conspiracy authors have seen a dual purpose to the funding of t he Bolsheviks. It is clear that revolutionaries like Lenin and Trotsky were being used to get Rus sia out of the war, to the benefi t of Germany. And communism was being supported by the globalists to advance their plan of creating tension between the capitalist West and socialist East. A. K. Chesterson, a right-wing British journalist and politician, who in 1 933 joined Oswald Moseley’s British Union of Fascists, observed that to understand politics, one must make a study of power elites. “Th ese elites, preferring to work in private, are rarely found posed for photographers, and their infl uence on events has therefore to be deduced from what is known of the agencies they employ.” He once wrote in his magazine, Can - dour, “ At times capitalism and communism would appear to be in con - flict, but this writer is confi de nt that their interests are in common and will eventually merge for one-world control.” Because of the warring factions in post-revolution Rus sia, sending an of - ficia l delegation to Rus sia was problematic. Th erefore, American fi nanciers came in the form of the American Red Cross Mission. One head of this group was Raymond Robins, described as “the intermediary between the Bolsheviks and the American government” and “the only man whom Lenin was always willing to see and who even succeeded in imposing his own per - sonality on the unemotional Bolshevik leader.” Lenin apparently came to u nderstand that he was being manipulated. “Th e state does not function as we desired,” he once wrote. “A man is at the wheel and seems to lead it, but the car does not drive in the desired direction. It moves as another force wishes.” Th is other “force” was the globalists behind the birth of commu - nism itself, “monopoly finance capitalists,” as Lenin described them."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 11 “One of the greatest myths of contemporary history is that the Bolshe - vik Revolution in Rus sia was a popular uprising of the downtrodden ma sses against the ruling class of the Czars,” wrote author G. Edward Griffi n. “. . . however, the planning, the leadership, and es pecially the fi - nancing came entirely from outside Russia, mostly from financiers in Ger - many, Britain, and the United States.” Th e fl ight of the privileged elite from Rus sia in 1918 sent shockwaves through the capitals of Europe and America and prompted a backlash that lasted for de cades. Th e cry “Workers of the world, unite!” struck fear into the capitalists of Western industry, banking, and commerce who were not in the know. Th is fear trickled through their political representa - tives, employees, and on into virtually every home. Mystifi ed c onspiracy researchers were puzzled for years about why such high-level capitalists as the Morgans, Warburgs, Schiff s, and Rocke fellers could condone, much less support, an ideolog y that overtly threatened their position and wealth. Author Gary Allen explained, “In the Bolshe - vik Revolution we have some of the world’s richest and most powerful m en financing a movement which claims its very existence is based on the concept of stripping of their wealth men like the Rothschilds, Rocke fel - lers, Schiff s , Warburgs, Morgans, Harrimans and Milners. But obviously these men have no fear of international communism. It is only logical to assume that if they financed it and do not fear it, it must be because they control it. Can there be any other explanation that makes sense?” Th e manufactured animosity between the democracies of the West and the communism of the East produced continuous tension from 1918 through the end of the twentieth century. But it threatened to get out of hand. Some researchers believe that the threat of worldwide communist so - cialism caused these globalists to turn to German nationalists. Th ey funded the rise of National Socialism in Germany and saw an armed Greater Ger - many as a barrier to communism in Europe. National Socialism was a form o f socialism almost indistinguishable from communism, only it was con - fin ed within national geographic boundaries. Under National Socia lism, the globalists could pit the various nations against each other. But following Germany’s military successes in Poland, the Low Countries, and France, these globalists realized they faced the same problem they had with the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"12 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH communists. A total German victory would result in a worldwide National Socialist system unable to produce the tensions and confl icts necessary for maximizing profi t and control. Th ey also may have feared that Stalin’s So - viet Union was about to launch an attack on Western Europe. Only Hitler’s G ermany had the strength to prevent this. At some point, the globalists determined that the Axis, aft er blocking Rus sia’s invasion of Europe, should lose the war. Th ey also began drawing up plans for the survival and renewal of a new form of National Socialism, one not dependent on racism and ethnicity. Working with the same fin - anciers and capitalists that had helped create German Nazism, these glo - balists began laying the foundation for a Fourth Reich. Conspiracy researchers have long suspected that one element of this Ge rman infl uence has been centered in the secretive Skull and Bones fra - ternity on the campus of Yale University. Known variously as Chapter 3 22, the Brotherhood of Death, the Order, or, more popularly, as Skull and Bones or simply Bones, the Order was brought from Germany to Yale in 1832 by General William Huntington Russell and Alphonso Taft . (Russell’s cousin, Samuel Russell, was an integral part of the B ritish-inspired Opium Wars in China. Taft , secretary of war in 1876 and U.S. attorney general and an ambassador to Rus sia, was the father of Wil - liam Howard Taft, t he only person to serve as both president and chief justice of the United States. Another prominent Bones member was Averell Harriman, who has been described as “a man at the heart of the American ruling class,” and played a prominent role in the establishment of the new American empire.) A pamphlet detailing an 1876 investigation of Skull and Bones head - quarters at Yale, known as “the Tomb” by a rival secret society, stated, “ . . . its founder [Russell] was in Germany before Senior Year and formed a warm friendship with a leading member of a German society. He brought back with him to college authority to found a chapter here. Th us was Bones founded.” Th e secr et German society may have been none other than the mysteri - ous and infamous Illuminati. Ron Rosenbaum, a former Yale student and o ne of the few journalists to take a serious look at Skull and Bones, noted that the offi cial skull-and-crossbones emblem of the Order was also the"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 13 offi cial crest of the Illuminati. In an investigative piece for Esquire maga - zine, Rosenbaum wrote, “I do seem to have come across definite, if skele - tal, links between the origins of Bones rituals and those of the notorious Ba varian Illuminists . . . [who] did have a real historical existence . . . . From 1 776 to 1785 they were an esoteric secret society with the more mystical freethinking lodges of German Freemasonry.” Other researchers agree that the Order is merely the Illuminati in dis - guise, since Masonic emblems, symbols, German slogans, even the layout o f their initiation room, all are identical to those found in Masonic lodges in Germany associated with the Illuminati. The Tomb is decked out with engravings in German, such as “Ob Arm, Ob Reich, im Tode gleich”— “Whether poor or rich, all are equal in death.” According to U.S. News & World Report, one of the Bonesmen’s traditional songs is sung to the tune of “Deutschland Über Alles.” Th e Ba varian Illuminati was formed on May 1, 1776, by Adam Weishaupt, a professor of canon law at Ingolstadt University of Bavaria, Germany. His Illuminati were opposed to what they saw as the tyranny of the Catholic Church and the national governments it supported. “Man is not bad,” Weishaupt wrote, “except as he is made so by arbitrary morality. He is bad because religion, the state, and bad examples pervert him. When at last rea - son becomes the religion of men, then will the problem be solved.” Weishaupt also evoked a philosophy that has been used with terrible r esults down through the years by Hitler and many other tyrants. “Behold our secret. Remember that the end justifi es the means,” he wrote, “and that the wise ought to take all the means to do good which the wicked take to do evil.” Th us, for the enlightened—or “illuminated”—any means to gain their ends is acceptable, whether this includes deceit, theft , mur - der, or war. Th e k ey to Illuminati control was secrecy. “The great strength of our Order lies in its concealment. Let it never appear in any place in its own name, but always covered by another name, and another occupation,” stated Weishaupt. He not only deceived the public, but he reminded his top leaders they should hide their true intentions from their own initiates by “speaking sometimes in one way, sometimes in another, so that one’s real purpose should remain impenetrable to one’s inferiors.”"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"14 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH In 1777, Weishaupt rolled his brand of Illuminism into Freemasonry aft er joining the Masonic Order’s Lodge Th eodore of Good Counsel in Munich. Th is lodge integrated with the Grand Orient Lodges, which, ac - cording to several researchers, were at the core of the Illuminati penetra - tion into Freemasonry. By 1783, the Bavarian government saw the Illuminati a s a direct threat to the established order and outlawed the organization, which prompted many members to flee Germany, only spreading their philosophies farther. Many researchers today believe the Illuminati still exists and that the o rder’s goals are nothing less than the abolition of all government, private property, inheritance, nationalism, the family unit, and organized reli - gion. Th is bel ief partially comes from the intriguing notion that the much- denounced Protocols of the Elders of Zion —used widely since its publication in 1864 to justify anti-Semitism—was actually an Illuminati document with Jewish elements added later for disinformation purposes. “Even though the Illuminati faded from public view, the monolithic ap - paratus set in motion by Weishaupt may still exist today,” commented a uthor William T. Still. “Certainly, the goals and methods of operation still exist. Whether the name Illuminati still exists is really irrelevant.” No one can doubt that socialism, whether Illuminati-inspired or not, ha s come to the United States, and socialism is the cornerstone of Nazi philosophy. Beginning with seemingly innocuous programs like Social Security and continuing through a myriad of government programs such as Medicare, farm subsidies, food stamps, and student entitlements, it seems that nearly every aspect of life today involves the centralized federal gov - ernment, which, since the attacks of 9/11, continues to draw ever more po wer unto itself. USA Today reported, “A sweeping expansion of social programs since 2000 has sparked a record increase in the number of Americans receiving federal government benefits such as college aid, food stamps and health care. A USA Today analysis of 25 major government programs found that enrollment increased an average of 17% in the pro - grams from 2000 to 2005.” Socialism has come to America because the National Socialists of the N ew World Order recognize that any social program requires central au - thority. And they know full well that with their im mense wealth and"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 15 power, they can control any central authority. Over the years, they have masked this creep of socialism by distracting appeals to nationalism. Americans are constantly reminded that the United States is God’s gift to the world, the epitome of freedom and democracy. Patriotism has been used to fan the fl ames of nationalism among Americans. Today, anyone who criticizes foreign policy, overseas military interventions, or even ques- tions national policies opens themselves to charges of being unpatriotic. It is possible that the United States is indeed becoming the Fourth Re - ich, the continuation of a philosophy of National Socialism thought to ha ve been vanquished more than half a century ago. Such a concept may seem absurd to those who cannot see past the rose- colored spin, hype, and disinformation poured out daily by the corporate mass media, most of which is owned by the same families and corporations that supported the Nazis before World War II. Many today describe what they see as “neo-Nazism,” the movement to r evive National Socialism. But this is a misnomer. Th ere is nothing neo, or new, about this trend. National Socialism never died. Th e philosophies of fascism are alive and active in modern America. Unfortunately, younger generations cannot understand the nuances of diff erences between fas - cism, corporate power, democracy, and a democratic republic. While the USA helped defeat the Germans in World War II, we failed t o defeat the Nazis. Many thousands of ranking Nazis came to the United States under a previously classifi ed program called Project Paperclip. Many other Nazis and war criminals set up shop in a variety of other nations, and many traveled on passports issued by the Vatican. They brought with them miraculous technology, such as the V-2 rockets, but they also brought with them Nazi ideology. Th is ideology, based on the Illuminati premise that the end justifi es the means, includes unprovoked wars of aggression and curtailment of individual liberties, and has gained sway in “the land of the free and the home of the brave.” Ranking Nazis, along with their young and fanatical protégés, used the l oot of Europe to create corporate front companies in many countries, in - cluding Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Turkey, and Argentina.

Members of the Thule Society encouraged a Munich locksmith and t oolmaker named Anton Drexler to bring workers into the political pro cess. Th e unassuming Drexler founded the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, or German Workers Party, which was guided to prominence by covert aid from conservative elements within industry and the military. Hitler, unable to make a living as an artist, turned to earning extra m oney by serving as an army intelligence agent reporting to a Captain Karl Mayr. “One day I received orders from my headquarters to find out what was behind an apparently political society which, under the name of ‘German Workers Party,’ intended to hold a meeting . . . . I was to go there a nd look at the society and to report upon it,” Hitler recalled in Mein Kampf. Arriving at the Sterneckerbrau beer hall, he was not overly im - pressed. “I met there about 20 to 25 people, chiefl y from among the lower walks of life,” wrote Hitler. However, the young military agent stood and “astonished” the small gathering by arguing against a proposal that Bavaria break ties with Prus sia. Impressed with the nationalistic and anti-Semitic views of the fl edgling party, military authorities allowed Hitler to join and began funding the party’s work. He became the party’s seventh regis- tered member. Hitler’s work in the party was initially supported both by funds from Ca ptain Mayr’s army intelligence unit and the dedicated anticommunists and occultists of the Th ule Society. Funding was passed through the pub - lisher of occult literature, Dietrich Eckart, whom Hitler called the “spir - itual founder of National Socialism.” Eckart was soon introducing the n ew member to the right social circles in Munich and his intellectual friends in the Th ule Society. Th e editors of Time-Life Books noted, “Die - trich Eckart took over as editor of the V olkischer Beobachter, the renamed Munchener Beobachter, which the party had purchased from the Th ule Society with money supplied partly by Mayr’s secret army account.” Author Joseph P. Farrell stated that the covert connections of Eckart a nd future deputy fuehrer Martin Bormann support the idea “that Hitler was deliberately manipulated and placed into power, and secretly manipu - lated behind the scenes by more powerful forces than even he wielded,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"A NEW REICH BEGINS 21 and, when he had served his purpose, was deliberately sabotaged and cast aside.” The forceful Hitler, armed with adequate funds, quickly gained control of the German Workers Party, which soon claimed three thou - sand members. In April 1920, Hitler changed the party’s name to the N ationalsozialistiche Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, the National Socialist Ger - man Workers Party, abbreviated to Nazi. Following an ill-fated attempt to take control of the government in 1 923, known as the Beer-hall Putsch, Hitler and his lieutenants were im - prisoned and the Nazi Party languished. Upon his release aft er only nine months, Hitler began to direct the Nazi Party into more eff ective, and le - gal, activities, which resulted in the Nazis becoming the largest political pa rty in Germany by July 1932. It was, in fact, wealthy businessmen in Western industrial and banking ci rcles who guaranteed Hitler’s success. Aft er Hitler lost a popular elec - tion to Hindenburg in 1932, thirty-nine business leaders, with familiar na mes like Krupp, Siemens, Th yssen, and Bosch, signed a petition urging the aged president Paul von Hindenburg to name Hitler chancellor. In January 1933, through a compromise with German aristocrats, industri - alists, and army offi ce rs, brokered by banker Baron Kurt Freiherr von Schroeder, Hitler was appointed chancellor of Germany. Th e deal to name Hitler chancellor of Germany was cut at von Schroeder’s home on Janu - ary 4, 1933. On hand were prominent industrialists, at least one director o f the giant Deutsche Bank as well as I. G. Farben’s Hermann Schmitz and Dr. Georg von Schnitzler representing Farben’s board of directors. According to author Eustace Mullins, also attending this meeting were John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles of the New York law firm Sullivan and Cromwell, which represented the Schroeder bank. Th is claim has been disputed by other researchers. At that time, Germany was a free republic with one of the most edu - cated and cultured populations in the world. Th e c ountry was at peace and enjoying a blossoming of democratic freedom under a coalition gov - ernment of the Weimar Republic. Oddly, Hitler went against tradition by choosing not to work out of an offi c e in the German Reichstag, or parliament building, and on February 27, 1933, the Reichstag was gutted by fire. In those slower, gentler times,"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"22 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH this act was as great a shock to the German people as the destruction of the World Trade Center towers was to Americans in 2001. Hitler blamed the destruction on communist terrorists. Inside the building, police arrested an incoherent, half-naked retarded Dutch youth named Marinus van der Lubbe. Th ey said he was carrying a Dutch Communist Party card. Aft er some time in custody, the youth confessed to being the arsonist. However, later investigation found that one person could not have started the mam - moth blaze and that incendiary devices had been carried into the building t hrough a tunnel that led to the offi ces of Hitler’s closest partner, Her - mann Goering. Despite misgivings in many quarters about the offi c ial explanation of the fire, it was announced that “the government is of the opinion that the situation is such that a danger to the state and nation existed and still ex - ists.” Law enforcement agencies quickly moved against not only the com - munists but also pacifi st s, liberals, and democrats. Less than a month later, on March 24, 1933, at Hitler’s urging, a panicky German Parlia - ment voted 441 to 94 to pass an “Enabling Act,” which became the start - ing point for Hitler’s dictatorship. As a result of the Enabling Act, the Nazi government required national i dentity cards, racial profiling, the equivalent of a national homeland se - curity chief (SS Reichsfuehrer Heinrich Himmler), gun confiscation, and, la ter, mass murders and incarcerations in concentration camps. “When Germany awoke,” wrote British reporter Douglas Reed, “a man’s home was no longer his castle. He could be seized by private individuals, could claim no protection from the police, could be indefinitely detained with - out preferment of charge; his property could be seized, his verbal and w ritten communications overheard and perused; he no longer had the right to foregather with his fellow countrymen, and his newspapers might no longer freely express their opinions.” Hitler’s financiers and especially Prussian military offi c ers were becom - ing alarmed over Hitler’s growing power, especially with some three mil - lion Sturmabteilung (SA) or Storm Detachment Brown Shirts under the c ommand of Hitler’s SA chief Ernst Roehm awaiting orders.

Th e German military began pledging their allegiance not to their nation but to Hitler. With the German population firmly under control due to massive propa - ganda and fear of government retaliation, Hitler was free to launch inva - sions into former German territories as well as Poland. It is instructive that Hitler did not invade Poland without pretext. A “f alse- fl ag” operation was accomplished first. SS men dressed in Polish uniforms fabricated an attack on a German radio station at Gleiwitz, which allowed Hitler to announce that a counterattack had been launched against Polish soldiers who had invaded German territory. Germany was simply making the world safe for National Socialism. World War II en - sued. W I T H T H E DE AT H of the eighty- seven-year-old Hindenburg on August 2, 1934, Hitler merged the offi ces of president and chancellor and pro - claimed himself commander in chief of the armed forces, the absolute le ader—fuehrer—of all Germany. He found a huge and powerful industrial base geared for war produc - tion already in place and awaiting his command. It had been put in place a t the end of World War I thanks to an infl ux of Western capital invest - ment. “Th is build-up for Europe an war both before and after 1933 was in great part due to Wall Street financial assistance in the 1920s to create the German cartel system and to technical assistance from well-known Amer - ican firms . . . to build the German Wehrmacht,” noted financial investi - gator and author Antony C. Sutton, who added, “Th e contribution made by American capitalism to German war preparations before 1940 can only be described as phenomenal.” (For example, in 1934 Germany pro - duced only 300,000 tons of natural petroleum products and synthetic gaso - line. In 1944, thanks to the transfer of hydrogenation technology from S tandard Oil of New Jersey to I. G. Farben, Germany produced 6,500,000 tons of oil, 85 percent of which was synthetic.) Th e intertwining of American capitalism with German corporations began following World War I, with two programs: the Dawes Plan (1924)"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"24 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH and the Young Plan (1928). Both plans, engineered in America, virtually guaranteed success for the fl edgling Nazi Party. Th e Dawes Plan, designed to restructure German war reparations, was named for chairman of the Allied Reparations Committee Charles G. Dawes and described by histo - rian Carroll Quigley as “largely a J. P. Morgan production.” Th is p lan used American loans to create and consolidate the German steel and chemical giants, Vereinigte Stahlwerke and I. G. Farben, both major supporters of Hitler. It caused anger and frustration among the Germans, because it meant foreign control of Germany’s fi nances—a fact constantly pointed out by Hitler in his speeches—and appeared open- ended, as no final repa - ration amount was ever announced. Its successor, the Young Plan, named f or J. P. Morgan agent Owen D. Young, required burdensome monetary payments from Germany. It, too, led to support within Germany for Hit - ler and his Nazis. Financing the rearmament of Germany in violation of the Versailles T reaty proved as profi table as it was dangerous to European peace. Ger - man steel magnate Fritz Th ysse n, a major financial contributor to Hitler, stated, “I turned to the National Socialist Party only after I became con - vinced that the fi g ht against the Young Plan was unavoidable if complete collapse of Germany was to be prevented.” Finance between Germany and the Allied nations was controlled by t he Bank of International Settlements (BIS), headquartered in Basel, Switzerland. It was the brainchild of Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht, president of the Reichsbank (in 1930, he resigned in protest to the Young Plan but was reappointed by Hitler in 1933) and the financial genius be - hind Germany’s economic revival. Although his father was an American ci tizen, Hjalmar was born in Germany during his mother’s return there and named aft er the famous American editor and politician. It was Schacht who provided an ongoing link between Hitler and Germany’s industrialists. Th e B IS was administered by a multinational staff , which historian Quigley called the “apex of the system” of bankers, to secretly exchange information and plan for the coming war. One of the corporate giants cre - ated in post–World War I Germany with assistance from American capi - tal was Internationale Gesellschaft F arbenindustrie A. G., better known"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"A NEW REICH BEGINS 25 in its shortened version as I. G. Farben. Created in 1926 by combining six existing chemical companies, it was the brainchild of Hermann Schmitz, who became the firm’s president. Under his guidance, I. G. Farben be - came the largest chemical manufacturing enterprise in the world. It was so po werful during the Nazi regime that the fi rm became known as a “state within a state.” Farben had subsidiaries, offices, and representatives in ninety-three c ountries, including the United States. Paul Manning, a CBS news corre - spondent in Europe during World War II, explained Schmitz’s connec - tions by pointing out that the Farben chief once “held as much stock in S tandard Oil of New Jersey as did the Rocke fellers.” By the time war be - gan in 1939, I. G. Farben had doubled in size, gaining participation and ma nagerial control over 380 other German companies as well as more than 500 foreign fi rms. Th is growth was made possible by bond sales in America, including one for $30 million offered by National City Bank, a forerunner of today’s Citibank. It was I. G. Farben’s patented Zyklon-B, a prussic acid poison gas, that w as used to kill victims in the “s hower baths” of Auschwitz, Maidanek, and Treblinka. Previously, the firm had received a contract to produce carbon monoxide, used to gas the sick and mentally defi cient under Ger- many’s euthanasia program. One example of the close business ties between the United States and N azi Germany was Walter C. Teagle, chairman of Standard Oil of New Jersey, which was owned by Rocke feller’s Chase Bank. Teagle also was a director of American I. G. Chemical Corporation, one of the subsidiaries of I. G. Farben, which changed its name to General Aniline and Film (GAF) in an eff ort to distance itself from its German owners. Teagle, through Rocke feller banking and oil interests, made his superi - ors a handsome profit just prior to the war. “[Teagle] remained in partner - ship with Farben in the matter of tetraethyl lead, an additive used in a viation gasoline,” wrote author Charles Higham. “[German Luft waff e chief Hermann] Goering’s air force couldn’t fly without it. Only Stand - ard, Du Pont and General Motors had the rights to it. Teagle helped orga - nize a sale of the precious substance to [Farben president] Schmitz, who in 1 938 traveled to London and ‘borrowed’ 500 tons from Ethyl, the British"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"26 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Standard subsidiary. Next year, Schmitz and his partners returned to London and obtained $15 million worth. Th e result was that Hitler’s air force was rendered capable of bombing London, the city that had provided the supplies. Also, by supplying Japan with tetraethyl, Teagle helped make it possible for the Japanese to wage World War II.” Following negative publicity regarding these tetraethyl transactions in 1 938, Teagle resigned from the board of GAF, to be replaced by future Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal. Curiously, it was this same Wal - ter Teagle who helped create the National Recovery Administration, one of President Roosevelt’s New Deal agencies designed to regulate Ameri - can business. Th i s was an odd choice if the captains of American industry were as opposed to socialism as they publicly claimed. By the mid-1930s, with the government, military, and the German ca rtels now firmly in hand, Hitler knew it was time to strengthen his in - flu ence over international bankers and businessmen. Despite his declared intentions to nationalize German businesses and curtail the power of in - ternational business and finance, Hitler initially had little trouble getting f unds from corporate sponsors who saw his National Socialism as a neces - sary alternative to worldwide communism. “[H]is appeal to the common people off e red a chance to win the work - ing class away from communism,” noted James Pool, author of W ho Fi - nanced Hitler. In America, eff o rts were under way to market Nazism to the public while concurrently practicing economic espionage. Teagle, together with Farben chief Schmitz, hired famed New York publicist Ivy Lee to pass proprietary information on American companies to Germany and to spin news stories so as to gloss over the darker side of Nazism. By the late 1930s, Lee was being paid $25,000 a year for disseminating pro-Nazi propaganda in America. Payments to Lee came from a Farben U.S. sub - sidiary, American I. G., and moved through Lee’s company account with C hase Bank and his personal account at New York Trust Company. “Th ey were American funds earned in the U.S. and under control of American directors, although used for Nazi propaganda in the United States,” stated author Sutton. Another solid conduit for Nazi propaganda and intelligence activities"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"A NEW REICH BEGINS 27 was the Hamburg-Amerika shipping line. Max Warburg, a leader of Deut - sche Bank, sat on the board of Hamburg-Amerika Steamship Line along w ith Prescott Bush, father and grandfather of two future U.S. presidents. Max Warburg was the brother of Paul Warburg, America’s first chairman of the Federal Reserve System and the man in charge of U.S. finances in World War I. American I. G. Chemical Corporation was more than just a source of f unds. It provided important intelligence to the Nazis throughout the war as noted by I. G. Farben director Max Ilgner, the nephew of Farben’s chairman Schmitz. He wrote, “Extensive information which we receive continuously from [American I. G.] is indispensable for our observations of American conditions . . . [and] is, since the beginning of the war, an important source of information for governmental, economic and mili - tary offi c es.” “Th e f ull story of I. G. Farben and its worldwide activities before World War II can never be known,” noted author Sutton, “as key German rec - ords were destroyed in 1945 in anticipation of Allied victory.” Th e ba nking industry, including foreign financial houses, provided Hitler and his Nazis with the funds to both consolidate and spread their National Socialist doctrine. Th roughout World War II, the bank of Baron von Schroeder acted as financial agents for Germany in both Britain and the United States. Antony C. Sutton described how John Foster Dulles handled Schroeder bank loans in the USA. In fact, Dulles, in addition to providing legal services to a joint Rocke feller-Schroeder investment firm, the Schroeder-Rocke feller Company, also sat on the board of directors of General Aniline and Film (GAF) from 1927 to 1934. GAF, as it was known during the war, remained a subsidiary of I. G. Farben. Schroeder, the powerful head of the J. H. Stein & Company banking house of Co - logne, had long provided financial support to the Nazis in hopes they w ould counteract the spread of communism. Hitler had given his word to von Schroeder that “National Socialism would engage in no foolish eco - nomic experiments”—in other words, he would not attack banking prac - tices except in rhetoric. Th is cl oseness between Hitler and the banking industry reached back to the earliest days of the Nazi Party. “On New Year’s Day 1924, the fi nancial"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"28 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH fate of Germany was settled in London at a meeting between Hjalmar Schacht, the new Reich Commissioner for National Currency, and Mon - tagu Norman, governor of the Bank of En gland,” noted author John T oland. “Schacht, who had already abolished emergency money, began with a frank disclosure of Germany’s desperate financial situation.” He then proposed to open a German credit bank second to the Reichsbank, but one that would issue notes in pound sterling. Schacht asked Norman to provide half the capital for this new bank. “Within 48 hours Norman not only formally approved the loan at the exceptionally low interest of a fl at fi ve percent but convinced a group of London bankers to accept bills far exceeding the loan . . . ,” Toland wrote. A year aft e r the meeting at Schroeder’s home that launched Hitler into power, Nazi offi cial and ideologist Alfred Rosenberg met with Schroeder Bank of London managing director T. C. Tiarks, who also was a director of the Bank of En gland. Montagu Norman, governor of the Bank of En gland, in early 1934 in - formed a select group of City of London financiers that Hitler’s regime w as a system with a good future. With no opposition, it was decided to provide covert financial help to Hitler until Norman could persuade the British government to abandon its pro-French policy to one more favora - ble to Germany. Th us a c urious relationship developed between these powerful banks of two supposedly belligerent nations, which continued throughout the war. Of course, it only appears curious to those who do not understand the economic cooperation among the world’s ruling elite. In December 1938, Schacht came to En gland as a guest at Montagu N orman’s home. Th e visit was declared to be purely personal. One month later, the hospitality was returned when Norman stopped over in Berlin for a visit with Schacht on his way to Switzerland. Although there was no public announcement as to what the two men discussed, it was rumored that they were attempting to create a common policy of settling Germa- ny’s foreign debts and expanding its markets. Th ere were also rumors that Britain’s bankers might extend to Germany some $375 million in export credits. The importance of such financial cooperation was explained by Sutton: “In the 1920s and 1930s, the New York Federal Reserve System,"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"A NEW REICH BEGINS 29 the Bank of En gland, the Reichsbank in Germany and the Banque de France also more or less infl uenced the political apparatus of their respec - tive countries indirectly through control of the money supply and crea - tion of the monetary environment. More direct infl u ence was realized by supplying political funds to, or withdrawing support from, politicians and po liti cal parties.” Funds for this financial control were channeled through the Bank of I nternational Settlements that, according to the bank’s charter and with the agreement of the respective governments, was immune from seizure, closure, or censure, even if its owners were at war. Th ese owners included the Morgan- affi liated First National Bank of New York (among whose directors were Harold S. Vanderbilt and Wendell Wilkie), the Bank of En gland, the Reichsbank, the Bank of Italy, the Bank of France, and other central banks. “The bank [BIS] soon turned out to be . . . a money funnel for American and British funds to fl ow into Hitler’s coff ers and to help Hitler build up his war machine,” wrote Higham. By the start of World War II, the BIS was under Nazi control with the bank’s directors includ - ing Schmitz, Schroeder, Dr. Walter Funk, and Emil Puhl of the Reichs- b ank. In 1939, when the Nazis moved into Czecho slovaki a, offi cia ls of the Czech National Bank removed $48 million in gold reserves to the Bank of En gland for safekeeping. Under pressure from the Nazis, Bank of En - gland governor Montagu Norman unhesitatingly agreed to move the gold to Switzerland, where it went into Nazi accounts to purchase essential war materials for Germany. Despite the obvious rearmament in Germany in the late 1930s, the N azis continued to find support in Britain, even within the Rothschild- dominated Bank of England.

America’s International Tel - ephone and Telegraph Corporation sold Germany communication and w ar material, including as many as fift y thousand artillery fuses per month, more than three years aft er Pearl Harbor. More interconnecting business ties between America and the Nazis ca n be seen by studying the Rocke feller-owned Chase National Bank, now JPMorgan Chase Bank, the largest corporate bank in the United States. Charles Higham explained how the Rocke fellers owned Standard Oil of New Jersey, the German accounts of which were siphoned through their own bank, the Chase, as well as through the independent National City Bank of New York (NCB), which also handled Standard, Sterling Products, General Aniline and Film (part of the I. G. Farben combine), Swedish Enskilda Bank (SKF), and ITT, whose chief, Sosthenes Behn, was a director of NCB. Two executives of Standard Oil’s German subsidi - ary were Karl Lindemann and Emil Helff e rich, prominent fi gures in Himmler’s Circle of Friends of the Gestapo—its chief financiers—and close friends and colleagues of the BIS’s Baron von Schroeder. Further banking connections, noted by author William Bramley, in - volved German banker Max Warburg and his brother Paul Warburg, who had bee n instrumental in establishing the Federal Reserve System in the United States. Both were directors of I. G. Farben. H. A. Metz of I. G. Farben was a director of the Warburg Bank of Manhattan, which later became part of the Rocke feller Chase Manhattan Bank. Standard Oil of New Jersey had been a cartel partner with I. G. Farben prior to the war. One American I. G. Farben director was C. E. Mitchell, who was also di - rector of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and of Warburg’s Na - tional City Bank. I. G. Farben president Hermann Schmitz served on the boa rds of Deutsche Bank and the Bank for International Settlements. In 1929, Schmitz was voted president of the board of National City Bank, now Citibank. In the 1930s, many people in both Britain and America were in agree - ment with Nazi ideology. Automobile-maker Henry Ford became a guiding light to Hitler, espe - cially in the realm of anti-Semitism. In 1920, Ford published an anti-Jewish"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"A NEW REICH BEGINS 31 book titled Th e International Jew . As Hitler worked on his book, Mein Kampf , in 1924, he copied liberally from Ford’s writing and even referred to Ford as “one great man.” Ford became an admirer of Hitler, provided funds for the Nazis, and, in 1938, became the first American to receive the highest honor possible for a non-German: the Grand Cross of the Su - preme Order of the German Eagle. Ford’s son, Edsel, sat on the board of American I. G. Farben and GAF. I n July 1940, at a meeting in Dearborn, Michigan, between ITT’s Westrick and the Fords, it was decided that rather than build aircraft en - gines for beleaguered Britain, the Ford company would build five-ton m ilitary trucks for Germany, the “backbone of German Army transporta - tion.” And the Fords were not alone in providing Nazi Germany with the m eans to wage war. Bradford Snell told the Wa s h i n g t o n Po s t in 1998 that Nazi armaments minister Albert Speer once told him that Hitler would never have considered invading Poland without the synthetic fuel tech - nolog y provided by General Motors. One future American corporate giant provided the Nazis with the m eans of registering, correlating, and assigning shipment schedules to the millions of Jews and others that were rounded up and sent to their deaths in concentration camps. According to author Edwin Black, Hitler’s desire to tabulate then eliminate these people was “greatly enhanced and ener - gized by the ingenuity and craving for profi t o f a single American company and its legendary, autocratic chairman. Th at company was International Business Machines [IBM], and its chairman was Th omas J. Watson.” Us - ing recently discovered Nazi documents and the testimony of former P olish workers, Black found that IBM technology was passed not only through the company’s German subsidiary, Deutsche Hollerith Maschinen Gesellschaft (Dehomag), but to a great extent through a subsidiary in Po - land, Watson Business Machines in Warsaw, which reported directly to t he IBM New York headquarters. Watson kept in close contact with his German subordinates, traveling t o Berlin at least twice a year from 1933 to 1939. Watson never sold IBM machines to the Nazis. Th ey all were merely leased.

Indeed, IBM services coursed through the entire German infrastructure in Europe,” noted Black. Aft e r America’s entry into the war, Nazi Hermann Fellinger was ap - pointed as German enemy-property custodian. Fellinger maintained W atson Business Machines, keeping the original staff and ensuring con - tinued profi t s for IBM. Th is subsidiary continued to send royalties and reports to the New York home offi ce through IBM’s Geneva offi ce. Watson, a well- connected Freemason, proclaimed “World Peace Th r ough World Trade” in 1937, while in Berlin to be named president of the International Chamber of Commerce. In that same year, President Franklin D. Roosevelt named Watson U.S. commissioner general to the International Exposition in Paris, and Hitler created a special medal for Watson, called the Merit Cross of the German Eagle with Star, to “honor foreign nationals who made themselves deserving of the German Reich.” “It ra n ked second in prestige on ly to Hitler’s Germa n Gra nd Cross,” noted Edwin Black. “Since the war, IBM . . . has obstructed, or refused to cooperate with, v irtually every major independent author writing about its history, ac - cording to numerous published introductions, prefaces, and ac knowledg - ments,” he added. Along with aviation hero Charles Lindbergh and newspaper magnate W illiam Randolph Hearst, another American supporter of Hitler was Joseph P. Kennedy, father of the future president. Kennedy was appointed U.S. ambassador to Britain in 1939 but was recalled in November 1940 fo r voicing his sympathies for Hitler. Roo sevelt had been advised by FBI director J.

Only a year aft e r Hitler came to power in Germany, many wealthy Americans looked with favor on a fascist system to counteract interna - tional communism. Many were disgruntled with President Roo sevelt’s socia l policies and felt he was secretly a communist. Irénée Du Pont and General Motors president William S. Knudsen in early 1934 planned to finance a coup d’etat that would overthrow the president with the aid of a $3 million–funded army of terrorists, modeled on the fascist movement in Paris known as the Croix de Feu. Th e u ndoing of this scheme was retired Marine Corps major general Smedley Butler, the most decorated marine in U.S. history, who was ap - proached by the plotters and urged to head the new military government. Bu tler, who had openly attacked Roo sevelt’s New Deal programs, how - ever, proved to be a loyal citizen and immediately informed Roo sevelt of the treasonous conspiracy. “Roo sevelt . . . knew that if he were to arrest the leaders of the houses of Morgan and Du Pont, it would create an un - thinkable national crisis in the midst of a depression and perhaps another W all Street crash. Not for the first or last time in his career, he was aware that there were powers greater than he in the United States,” noted Higham. Roo sevelt decided to leak the story to the press, which generally discounted it as a “ridiculous” rumor. Nevertheless, some of the primary plotters skipped the country until the furor died down. But the story did prompt Congress to appoint a special committee to look into the matter. Yielding to the powerful interests involved, the committee dragged its feet for four years before finally publishing a report marked for “restricted circulation.” Although downplaying the signifi cance of this attempted coup, the committee’s report did state that “certain persons made an at - tempt to establish a fascist organization in this country” and that the com - mittee “was able to verify all the pertinent statements made by General Bu tler.” Some researchers have speculated that this move against Roo sevelt was m erely a ploy orchestrated by the same elite families that put him into power. It was a scheme to paint FDR as an opponent of Wall Street and gain public support for his policies. If this plot was legitimate, it was the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"34 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH last overt move against an American president by powerful business inter - ests until 1963. Ploy or not, this incident provides not only an example of h idden U.S. history but also the lengths to which powerful persons will go to subvert the principles of the United States. Even at the time, some astute Americans could clearly see the connec - tions between powerful national business leaders and Nazi Germany. U.S. a mbassador to Germany William E. Dodd told reporters upon his arrival back home in 1937, “A clique of U.S. industrialists is hell-bent to bring a fascist state to supplant our democratic government and is working closely with the fascist regime in Germany and Italy. I have had plenty of oppor - tunity in my post in Berlin to witness how close some of our American r uling families are to the Nazi regime.” It was not just the ruling families that looked favorably on National Socialism and a fascist government. Prior to World War II, right-wing demagogues like Father Charles Cough - lin and Gerald K. Smith, an ordained minister, drew thousands of sup - porters from Christian American workers into their America First and U nion Party with their message of nationalism and fears of a “Jewish con - spiracy.” Smith’s planned religious theme park in the 1960s was never c ompleted, but his “Christ of the Ozarks” draws tourists to Eureka Springs, Arkansas, to this day. Prior to the war, no one paid serious attention to warnings against the spread of fascism, just as few people seem willing to consider the possibility of a fascist takeover of the USA today. A successful political movement requires money, lots of it. Th e re is no question that Hitler’s rise to power rested heavily on the support of the major German banks—Schroeder’s Cologne banking firm, the Deut - sche Bank, Deutsche Kredit Gesellschaft , a nd the huge insurance firm Allianz—all with many interconnecting ties to foreign banks and compa - nies. Th e re were also close ties to prominent U.S. banks. Higham de - scribed how, in 1936, the J. Henry Schroeder Bank of New York had e ntered into a partnership with the Rocke fellers. Named Schroeder, Rocke feller and Company, Investment Bankers, the firm became what Time magazine called the economic booster of “the Rome-Berlin Axis.” “Avery Rocke feller owned 42 percent of Schroeder,” Higham reported. “Th eir lawyers were John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles of Sullivan and Cromwell.

Similar amounts were loaned again in 1944. But all the tightest business connections came to naught, for by 1941, t he international order had turned against Hitler. Germany’s blitzkrieg had shocked the ruling elite, as first Poland, then the rest of Europe, came under Nazi control. Britain was helpless to stop Hitler, who was already making preparations for a preemptive attack on the Soviet Union. In short, Hitler was getting out of hand."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"C 2 OF RUDOLF HESS HAPTER THE STRANGE CASE ALTHOUGH R ELEGATED TO A MINOR FOOTNOTE IN HISTORY, THE strange case of Nazi deputy fuehrer Rudolf Hess in 1941 provides a rare glimpse of the elitist control over events during World War II.

Th e conventional view of the Hess flight is that of an increasingly marginalized member of Hitler’s inner circle who sought to regain favor with his fuehrer by making an unauthorized visit to Britain in the hope of personally negotiating an end to the war and even enlisting En gland’s aid in the fight against Soviet expansionism. Hitler disavowed Hess as insane, while British prime minister Winston Churchill more kindly described Hess’s attempt at negotiation as a “frantic deed of lunatic benevolence.” At the Nuremberg trials, Hess was found guilty of “crimes against peace ” and spent the rest of his life a prisoner in Berlin’s Spandau Prison. In August 1987, British military authorities announced that Hess had committed suicide, a judgment that continues to be disputed.

He was well schooled and well traveled by the time he joined the G erman Army during World War I, serving in the same regiment as Cor - poral Adolf Hitler. He was wounded twice and later became a fighter pi - lot, but the war ended before he could experience much combat. Returning to Munich aft e r the war, Hess helped other ex-servicemen in the paramilitary Freikorps to oust a short-lived Communist local gov - ernment. Aft e r helping to break the Communist coup, Hess joined the Th ule Society and enrolled as a student at the University of Munich, where he met his future wife and the man who was to prove a major infl u- ence on both Hitler and himself: Professor General Karl Haushofer. According to author William Bramley, Professor Haushofer was a mem - ber of the Vril, another secret society based on a book by British Rosicru - cian Lord Bulward Litton, about the visit of an Aryan “super race” to earth i n the distant past. A mentor to both Hess and Hitler, Haushofer had traveled extensively in the Far East before becoming a general in the kaiser’s army of World War I. “His early associations with infl uential Japanese businessmen and statesmen were crucial in forming the German-Japanese alliance of World War II,” wrote author Peter Levenda. Haushofer became the fi rst ranking Nazi to form relationships with South American govern - ments in anticipation of a war with America. Th ese r elationships would prove instrumental in the later escape of war criminals from Europe. Haushofer, as a professor at the University of Munich, worked out Hit- l er’s policy of Lebensraum, “living space” for a hemmed-in Germany. Al - though he gained a reputation as the “man behind Hitler,” Haushofer’s v iews on geopolitics were largely accepted by Hitler, but only aft er they came from the mouth of Hess. “I was only able to infl uence [Hitler] through Hess,” he told his American captors in 1945. Both Hess and Haushofer first met Hitler at one of the beer hall meet - ings of the German Workers Party. During the abortive Beer-hall Putsch o f 1923, when the new Nazi Party tried to seize power in Bavaria, Hess was at Hitler’s side. When the coup failed, Hess drove off to Austria,"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"38 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH where he was sheltered by members of a paramilitary wing of the Th ule Society. Voluntarily returning to Germany, Hess joined Hitler in Landsberg Pr ison aft er being convicted of conspiracy to commit treason. Due to the political climate at the time, both men were released within a year. During their months of imprisonment, Hess became a close confi dant to Hitler and helped produce Hitler’s book, Mein Kampf. Hess edited, rewrote, and organized the book so extensively that some researchers believe he should have been credited as coauthor. “As far as I know, Hess actually dic - tated many chapters of that book,” Haushofer told interrogators in 1945. Following the reorganization of the Nazi Party in 1925, Hess became H itler’s private secretary. He moved upward through other major party positions until 1933, shortly aft er Hitler became chancellor of Germany, when he was appointed deputy fuehrer. It was Hess who initiated the “Heil Hitler!” salute and was the first to call Hitler “mein Fuehrer.” Furthermore, as a member of the Geheimer Kabinettsrat—the Nazi S ecret Cabinet Council—and the Ministerial Council for the defense of the Reich, Hess was well aware of the secret work to develop a German atomic bomb. Proof of this knowledge came during an interview with Britain’s home secretary Sir John Simon, following his flight to En gland. “[O]ne day sooner or later this weapon will be in our hand and . . . I can only say that it will be more terrible than anything that has gone before,” Hess revealed. It is clear that Hess was much more powerful and well connected than is ge nerally reported. He was the person closest to Hitler, one who shared his aspirations and beliefs. On the eve of war in 1939, Hess was even named the successor to Hitler aft er Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering. T H E E XCE P T IONA L POW ER and position of Rudolf Hess demands close scrutiny of his ill-fated fl ight to En gland and its consequences. Just such a study was undertaken in 2001 by three British authors—Lynn Picknett, Clive Prince, and Stephen Prior. “It soon becomes apparent that the whole Hess aff air, from 1941 onward, is riddled with so many contradictions and anomalies that it is obvious that the British authorities were desperate to"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THE STRANGE CASE OF RUDOLF HESS 39 conceal something,” they concluded. “Judging by the fact that they are still desperate to conceal it, common sense dictates that they deem this secret to be unsuitable for public consumption, even aft er sixty years.” A detailed study of Hess’s flight clearly indicates that it was not just a s udden whim of an unstable individual. Th ere is evidence of foreknowl - edge in Germany. Hess prepared for the flight meticulously over a period o f months, even having famed aircraft designer Willy Messerschmitt mod - ify a twin- engine Messerschmitt-110. Hess also received special flight t raining from Messerschmitt’s chief test pilot, as well as Hitler’s personal pilot, Hans Baur—evidence that Hitler had knowledge of Hess’s plans. On his fl ight, Hess carried the visiting cards of both Haushofer and his son, Albrecht Haushofer, yet another indication of his intent as a peace mission, since the elder Haushofer had long been an advocate of maintain - ing friendly relations with Britain as a cornerstone of German politics. According to the French scholars Michel Bertrand and Jean Angelini ( writing under the name of Jean-Michel Angebert), Haushofer passed along to Hess the names of members of the Order of the Golden Dawn, an occult society in England, as well as names of supporters of a peace ini - tiative, such as the duke of Hamilton, the duke of Bedford, and Sir Ivone Ki rkpatrick. Th e Golden Dawn, most popularly connected to En gland’s foremost occultist, Aleister “the Beast” Crowley, was an outgrowth of the Th eosophical Society, from which much Nazi mysticism was derived, and had close ties with the Th ule Society. According to some theories, British Intelligence manipulated Hess’s bel ief in the occult to provoke his flight to En gland. Oddly enough, this scheme involved Crowley as well as British Intelligence agent Ian Flem - ing, who would later write the popular James Bond novels. “Via a Swiss a strologer known to Fleming, astrological advice was passed along to Hess (again, via the Haushofers and by Dr. Ernst Schulte-Strathaus, an astro - logical adviser and occultist on Hess’s staff s ince 1935) advocating a peace mission to En gland,” wrote Levenda. “May 10, 1941, was selected as the appropriate date, since an unusual conjunction of six planets in Taurus (that had the soothsayers humming for months previous) would take place at that time.” Once in England, Hess was to be debriefed by fellow occultist Crowley."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"40 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH One clue that such an outrageous plan may have been put into opera - tion was somewhat supported by Nazi armaments minister Albert Speer, wh o wrote in later years, “[I]n Spandau Prison, Hess assured me in all seri - ousness that the idea had been inspired in him in a dream by supernatural fo rces.” But whatever Hess’s motivations, it is clear that foreknowledge of his flight existed in Britain as well as Germany. In fact, both Haushofer’s son and Hess wrote to the duke of Hamilton, whom Hess had met briefl y during the 1936 Berlin Olympics, in hopes of initiating peace talks between the two men, perhaps even opening a direct link to King George VI. On orders of the government, Hamilton did not reply. However, one l etter to Hamilton from the younger Haushofer was shown to British for - eign secretary Lord Halifax and air minister Sir Archibald Sinclair. “Both o f these ministers were supportive of the peace initiative, which had to be kept offi cially secret and distance [ sic ] from Churchill,” wrote Picknett, Prince, and Prior. “So, while it is true to say that Hamilton showed the letter to his superiors, what is omitted is the fact that they kept quiet about it [emphasis in the original].” It should be recalled that the Windsor family have always been sensi - tive about their German extraction. Peace with their relatives would have bee n very desirable during the war years. In 2000, senior British govern - ment sources confirmed that private letters between the Queen Mother a nd Lord Halifax showed hostility toward Churchill and even a willing - ness to submit to Nazi occupation if the monarchy was preserved. Even C hurchill, who was tightly connected to the empire-builders of Britain, made it clear that the object of the war was to stop Germany—not the Nazis. “You must understand that this war is not against Hitler or Na - tional Socialism,” Churchill once stated, “but against the strength of the G erman people, which is to be smashed once and for all, regardless whether it is in the hands of Hitler or a Jesuit priest.” In a letter to Lord Robert Boothby, Churchill explained that “Germa- n y’s unforgivable crime before the second world war was her attempt to extricate her economic power from the world’s trading system and to cre - ate her own exchange mechanism which would deny world finance its opp ortunity to profi t.” It also must be recalled that in 1941, despite the successful Battle of"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"THE STRANGE CASE OF RUDOLF HESS 41 Britain, En gland was economically strangled and near defeat. At the time Hitler seemed unstoppable and it was quite easy to envision a Nazi vic - tory. Th e a ristocracy, industrialists, bankers, and even the royal family were eager for peace. “Hess did not imagine a peace group,” concluded Picknett, Prince, and Prior, “nor was it invented by MI6, but its existence at such a level [as the royals] would explain why so much about the Hess aff air was—and continues to be—hushed up.” As for Hitler, Germany was preparing to strike Rus sia, and he did not w ant a two-front war, the very situation that caused Germany’s defeat in World War I. Hitler wanted En gland as an ally against communism. “With En gland alone [as an ally], one’s back being covered, could one be - gin the new Germanic invasion [of Rus sia],” Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf. I n other words, Hitler needed peace with Britain before undertaking an attack on Russia. Securing peace on the Western Front may have become an urgent pri - ority for Hitler. According to former Soviet military intelligence offi c er Vladimir Rezun (writing under the pen name Viktor Suvorov), Hitler was forced to launch a preemptive assault against the Soviet Union in June 1941, to forestall an attack on Western Europe by Stalin in July. Suvorov’s work has been published in eighty-seven editions in eighteen la nguages, yet has received virtually no mention in the U.S. corporate mass media, despite the fact that his assertions turn conventional history up - side down. Most people have been taught that Stalin naively trusted Hit - ler and was totally surprised by Hitler’s attack. Admiral N. G. Kuznetsov, who in 1941 was the Soviet Navy minister a nd a member of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, was quoted by Suvorov as stating in his postwar memoirs, “For me there is one thing beyond all argument—J. V. Stalin not only did not exclude the possibility of war with Hitler’s Germany, on the contrary, he considered such a war . . . inevitable . . . . J. V. Stalin made preparations for war . . . wide a nd varied preparations—beginning on dates . . . which he himself had selected. Hitler upset his calculations.” While Suvorov’s conclusions grate against the conventional view of Hitler’s attack on Russia, he has provided a compelling argument. Suvorov pointed out that by June 1941, Stalin had massed vast numbers of troops and equipment along Rus sia’s European"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"42 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH frontier, not to defend the Motherland but in preparation for an attack westward. Stalin’s motive was to bring communism to Europe by force, a plan he expressed in a 1939 speech. “Th e experience of the last twenty years has shown that in peacetime the Communist movement is never strong enough to seize power. Th e dictatorship of such a party will only become possible as the result of a major war,” stated Stalin. Noting that when the German attack began on June 22, 1941, they c ould fi eld a mere 3,350 tanks, mostly lightly armored and gunned, as compared to the Rus sians 24,000 tanks, many of superior armor and ar - mament, retired U.S. Department of Defense offi cia l Daniel W. Michaels wrote, “Stalin elected to strike at a time and place of his choosing. To this end, Soviet development of the most advanced off ensive weapons systems, primarily tanks, aircraft , and airborne forces, had already begun in the early 1930s . . . . Th e G erman ‘Barbarossa’ attack shattered Stalin’s well-laid plan to ‘liberate’ all of Europe.” Suvorov supported his contention by pointing to the fact that Rus sian tr oops were prepared to attack, not defend, which led to the early German victories; that Rus sian troops had been issued maps only of Eastern Euro - pe an cities, not for the defense of Rus sia; that Rus sian troops had been is- sued Rus sian-German phrase books with such expressions as “Stop t ransmitting or I’ll shoot”; and that none of Stalin’s top commanders were ever held accountable for the Barbarossa debacle, since they had all merely followed Stalin’s orders. Suvorov concludes, “Stalin became the absolute ruler of a vast empire h ostile to the West, which had been created with the help of the West. For all that, Stalin was able to preserve his reputation as naive and trusting, while Hitler went down in history as the ultimate aggressor. A multitude of books have been published in the West based on the idea that Stalin was not ready for war while Hitler was.” He also said the resources of Stalin’s war machine have been underesti - mated. “Despite its grievous losses, it had enough strength to withdraw a nd gather new strength to reach Berlin. How far would it have gone had it not sustained that massive blow on 22 June, if hundreds of aircraft and thousands of tanks had not been lost, had it been the Red Army and not the Wehrmacht which struck the first blow? Did the German Army have"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"THE STRANGE CASE OF RUDOLF HESS 43 the territorial expanse behind it for withdrawal? Did it have the inex - haustible human resources, and the time, to restore its army aft e r the first Soviet surprise attack?” Perhaps the best support for Suvorov’s claims came from Hitler him - self. “Already in 1940 it became increasingly clear from month to month t hat the plans of the men in the Kremlin were aimed at the domination, and thus the destruction, of all of Europe. I have already told the nation of the build-up of Soviet Rus sian military power in the East during a period when Germany had only a few divisions in the provinces bordering Soviet Rus sia. Only a blind person could fail to see that a military build-up of unique world-historical dimensions was being carried out. And this was not in order to protect something that was being threatened, but rather only to attack that which seemed incapable of defense . . . . I may say this t oday: if the wave of more than twenty thousand tanks, hundreds of divi - sions, tens of thousands of artillery pieces, along with more than ten thou - sand airplanes, had not been kept from being set into motion against the R eich, Europe would have been lost,” the fuehrer stated in his speech on December 11, 1941, when he declared war against the United States. Of course, the victors always write history, so whether Hitler’s attack o n the Soviet Union was sheer aggression or a necessary preemptive strike will probably be argued for many years. But, if it proves true that Hitler was merely forestalling an imminent attack by the Soviet Union, it places the history of World War II in an entirely diff erent context. It would cer - tainly go far in explaining Hitler’s otherwise inexplicable actions in start - ing a two-front war, the very situation he had warned against in Me in Kampf . It also would help explain why Franklin Roo sevelt, at the bidding of the globalists, was arming the Soviet Union in blatant violation of the Neutrality Acts of 1935, 1936, and 1937. By the end of 1940, with all Eu - rope under German control and Britain threatened, they may have deter - mined to stop Hitler. Hitler clearly indicated what he saw as the machinations undertaken to p revent any negotiated end to hostilities in 1941. In a speech to the Reich - stag less than a week before Hess’s arrival in Scotland, he declared, “All my e ndeavors to come to an understanding with Britain were wrecked by the determination of a small clique, which, whether from motives of hate or"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"44 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH for the sake of material gain, rejected every German proposal for an un - derstanding due to their resolve, which they never concealed, to resort to wa r, what ever happened.” Picknett, Prince, and Prior even argue that Seelowe—or Sea Lion, the c ode name for the proposed German invasion of England—was a “sham right from the beginning,” an eff ort by Hitler to distract Stalin by feint - ing west when he actually planned to strike to the east. It was merely a c over for the mobilization of men and equipment needed for the invasion of the Soviet Union. One clue that this tactic was in play can be seen in the fact that Hitler, who was known for constantly interfering with his generals on the smallest of details, never showed any real interest in the plans for an invasion of England, according to German military historian Egbert Kieser. Th ese authors, along with other historians, explain that Hitler’s strange order to halt the German advance at Dunkirk allowed the British Army to escape the continent. Hitler wanted his future ally intact. And the prelude to such an alliance was Hess’s peace initiative. On Ma y 10, 1941, when Hess’s ME-110 arrived over Scotland, he was to have landed at an airstrip near the Hamilton ancestral home, negotiate peace terms with the anti- Churchill faction, and then be flown to Sweden as the first leg of a return trip home. Th is faction was prepared to oust Churchi ll and agree to a ceasefire with Germany. Th is p roposition may not be as absurd as it first sounds. Picknett, Prince, and Prior noted, “Th e extravagant postwar mythologizing of Churchill has obscured the fact that he remained in a very insecure posi - tion politically for at least the first two years of his premiership, largely beca use it was well known that he did not—to put it mildly—enjoy the support and confi dence of the king.” Th e n otion of an internal coup against Churchill was even broached to President Roo sevelt by FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. In a memorandum written only a week before the Hess fl ight, Hoover informed Roo sevelt, “[I]t was reported that the Duke of Windsor entered into an agreement which in substance was to the eff ect that if Germany was victorious in the war, Hermann Goering through his control of the army would overthrow Hitler and would thereaft er install the Duke of Windsor as the King of En gland.”"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THE STRANGE CASE OF RUDOLF HESS 45 Interestingly, Hess’s fl ight brought him through the weakest section of the British coastal radar net, plus he overfl ew a Royal Air Force base twice without provoking any response—clues that orders had been given some - where along the chain of command to facilitate his arrival. But he missed h is landing spot and, low on fuel, finally was forced to bail out over a farm just south of Glasgow. Unarmed, his ankle broken from the jump, he was captured by a farmer with a pitchfork. Th e Home Guard quickly became involved and the whole secret operation was blown. Although Hess ini - tially claimed to be a Luft wa ffe pilot named Alfred Horn, this subterfuge quickly failed. “Horn” kept asking to be taken to the duke of Hamilton. Th e whole scheme was a massive embarrassment to all concerned. Ev - eryone, including Hitler, had to disavow any connection with the plot. Aft e r all, for Hitler to admit that he was preparing to make peace with Britain would have tipped off Stalin that a German attack on Russia was imminent. British intelligence found itself conflicted over the Hess aff ai r. “MI6 was supportive of a negotiated peace with Germany, as it saw Communist Rus sia as the real enemy,” noted the three authors, “whereas SOE [Special Operations Executive] was in favor of an alliance with Stalin against Hit - ler. As the Prime Minister’s creation, SOE was naturally pro-Churchill.” Th is r ivalry led to strange occurrences along Hess’s path to prison. He was moved to a variety of locations, some recollections of his whereabouts confl icting with others. There was every opportunity for pulling a switch before Hess was finally locked up in the Tower of London. Picknett, Prince, and Prior introduced yet another mystery—the death o f George, the Duke of Kent, King George VI’s youngest brother and the first member of the royal family to die while on active military service since the fift eenth century. Th e duke, like others in the royal family, was an admirer of the Nazis and was likely to have joined a peace group in a negotiated peace. He also served as an unoffi cial intelligence offi cer to his brother, the king. (It may be noteworthy that in 1939, King George in - stalled the duke as the grand master of En glish Freemasonry at a ceremony a t Olympia in West London.) Superfi cia lly, the duke’s death on August 25, 1942, was the result of a routine wartime air accident. It was reported that the Sunderland fl ying"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"46 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH boat in which he was a passenger crashed into a low hill called Eagles Rock, in Caithness, Scotland. Th e offi cial account of the accident said the seaplane was taking the duke on a morale-boosting mission to Iceland when the pilot changed course “for reasons unknown,” descended through clouds without making sure he was above water, and crashed into a hill - side. However, the complete file containing the details of the crash, made b y a court of inquiry, has disappeared and anomalies abound. Th e d uke’s plane clearly was in the pro cess of ascending when it crashed, indicating it may have lift ed off from nearby Loch More near Braemore Lodge, where accounts place the captive Hess. Second, when statements from witnesses and the one survivor are compared with the offi cial ros- ters, it becomes clear that there was an unaccounted-for passenger on the cra ft . Th ese f actors, coupled with much other evidence—both hard and circumstantial—support the conjecture that the anti- Churchill peace group waited until mid-1942, a low ebb in Britain’s war fortunes, before attempting to fly the duke of Kent and Rudolf Hess to Sweden to an - nounce a peace plan that would topple the Churchill government. Of c ourse, this never happened, due to the plane crash. Whether this was sabotage or an accident has not been clearly established. If Hess died in the duke’s plane, it would have presented a thorny prob - lem for Churchill—how to explain the mangled corpse of a man who was su pposed to be their prized prisoner. Any investigation would have re - vealed the involvement of ranking members of British society, even the r oyals, in the peace initiative. Here the story takes an even more bizarre twist. Evidence gathered for t heir book by Picknett, Prince, and Prior—including Hess being reported as seen in diff erent locations at the same time, and inconsistencies in offi - cial reports—indicated that a duplicate Hess may have been prepared p rior to the plane crash. “We are convinced that in the summer of 1942 there were two Hesses, one in Scotland and one at Maindiff Court, Aber - gavenny, Wales,” they wrote. Th e r eal Hess died in the crash and the dou - ble lived to stand trial at Nuremberg and serve his sentence at Spandau.

Th e i dea of a Rudolf Hess double is not new, and various theories have been advanced. One suggested that the look- alike was forced to play Hess out of fear for his family. Another was that the Hess double was a German—whoever the man was, German was his first language—and an ardent Nazi, who was convinced it was necessary to the party that he maintain the subterfuge, especially since he might become the founder of a Fourth Reich. But the most provocative explanation comes from Picknett, Prince, a nd Prior, who learned that former CIA director Allen Dulles, a founder of the Council on Foreign Relations and high commissioner of Germany aft er the war, had dispatched Dr. Donald Ewen Cameron to Nuremberg to examine Hess. Dulles expressed to Cameron his belief that the Hess being held in Germany was an impostor and that the real Hess had been secretly executed on orders from Churchill. Knowing of Hess’s war wounds, Dulles wanted Cameron to especially note if there were any scars on the prisoner’s chest. Interestingly enough, British military authorities in Nuremberg refused to allow such an examination. But the story grows stranger. Dr. Cameron was a Scot who pioneered b rainwashing techniques before the end of the war, at the Allen Memorial Institute at McGill University, funded by the Rocke feller Foundation. He went on to become president of the American Psychiatric Association as well as the first president of the World Psychiatric Association. He also became part of the CIA’s notorious MKULTR A mind-control program. Various researchers have wondered if Dulles’s choice of Dr. Cameron to study Hess might have grown from the knowledge or suspicion that the man posing as Hess had been brainwashed into actually believing he was the Nazi deputy fuehrer. Mind- control experimentation was much further along—particularly in Europe, as shall be seen—than most people realize. Why else should Dulles have chosen a brainwashing expert to study Hess when any competent physician could have checked for scar tissue?

One clear example may be found simply by comparing fi gures from its armaments industry. Despite constant bomb­ ing by the Allies, overall production of tanks, small arms, ships, and air­ craft was higher at the beginning of 1945 than in 1941, when Germany was victorious on all fronts and America had not yet entered the war. Technological advances were seen in almost every area. The rate and q uality was astounding. Plastics, which only came into general use in the United States during the 1950s, were developed in Nazi Germany. Bakelite, polystyrene (under the name Trolitul), Plexiglas, polyethylene (forerunner of today’s plastic Baggies and syringes), polyamide (nylon), and aldols (a derivative of polyvinyl) were all produced during wartime. Th e various forms of plastic were produced under a consortium of compa­ nies but led by I. G. Farben, which also in 1941 synthesized the opiate methadone and Demerol under the name “pethidine.” Television, which most Americans did not get to see until the early 1 950s, was highly developed in Nazi Germany. More than 150,000 per­ sons in twenty-eight public viewing rooms in Berlin saw clear television broadcasts of the 1936 Olympics. Th ey watched screens equipped with Fernseh 180-line cathode ray tube projectors that presented a picture about forty-eight by forty-two inches. In 1939, the German firm Fernseh began developing a miniaturized TV system that allowed pilots to guide both bombs and missiles aft er launching. Th is system was used in the anti- aircraft rocket Wasserfall, or waterfall. “Many of these tests failed,” noted author Joseph P. Farrell. “But by the war’s end, a successful test of the tele vi sion- guided ‘Tonne’ missile was conducted by German scientists for the Allies in Berlin, with the target being a photograph of a little girl’s face. Th e test was successful, much to the impressed, and doubtless shocked, Allied observers.” Tanks, which began the war as little more than armor-plated bulldoz­ e rs designed to support infantry, were developed into independent, thickly armored machines powered by gas turbines, with guns stabilized while moving, hydrokinetic power transmissions, and defenses against chemical and biological attacks. Some German tanks were so far ahead of their time, they were still being utilized in other nations as late as battles in the 1970s.

Th e innovative 9-mm German MP-40 Schmeisser machine pistol saw extensive use during the war, and its successors, the MP-43 and the MP- 44 assault rifl es, became the forerunners of today’s ubiquitous AK-47. Late in the war, some MP-44s carried an early but eff ective night- vision light and scope called the Vampyr, or Vampire. At the end of the war in 1945, American military intelligence offi c ers were shocked by the technology they found as Allied forces overran Ger­ man research facilities. Supersonic rockets, nerve gas, jet aircraft , guided missiles, stealth technology, hardened armor—even fl ying saucers—were just some of the groundbreaking technologies being developed in Nazi laboratories, workshops, and factories. To give some idea of the aspirations of Nazi scientists, the huge ME-264 was dubbed the “America Bomber,” while a three-stage rocket was named the “Mars Rocket.” As respected British historian Barrie Pitt noted, “[T]he Nazi war ma­ ch ine swung into action utilizing as much as it could of the most up- to- date scientifi c knowledge available, and as the war developed, the list of further achievements grew to staggering proportions. From guns firing ‘shells’ of air to detailed discussions of fl ying saucers; from beams of sound that were fatal to a man at 50 yards, to guns that fired around corners and others that could ‘see in the dark’—the list is awe-inspiring in its variety.” Pitt stated that while some German technology was less developed than imagined at the time, “some were dangerously near to a completion stage which could have reversed the war’s outcome.” Former Polish military journalist Igor Witkowski described German w artime research as “the greatest technological leap in the history of our civilization.” He said the Germans ignored Einstein and developed an ap­ proach to science based on quantum theories. “Don’t forget that Einstein- ian physics, relativity physics, with its big-picture view of the universe, represented Jewish science to the Nazis. Germany was where quantum mechanics was born. Th e Germans were looking at gravity [and other matters] from a diff erent pers pective to ever yone else.

Consider that at the beginning of the war, aircraft were made of canvas stretched over a wooden frame. By 1945, Germany had become the fi rst nation in the world to put into service an all-metal, jet-propelled jet fi ghter—the Messerschmitt- 262. Th ey also produced the world’s first op­ erational helicopter and vertical takeoff and landing aircraft . As German scientists worked feverishly to perfect the V-2 rockets and o ther, more secret weapons, SS chief Heinrich Himmler was taking steps to separate his SS from normal party and state control. “In the spring of 1944 Hitler approved Himmler’s proposal to build an SS-owned indus­ trial concern in order to make the SS permanently independent of the state budget,” wrote Nazi armaments minister Albert Speer. Employing methods later used by the CIA, SS leaders created a number of business fronts and other organizations—many using concentration camp labor—with an eye toward producing revenue to support SS activities. Th ese highly compartmentalized groups headed by young, ambitious SS offi cers neither required nor desired any connection with Germany’s high-profile leaders. Th eir purpose was to create an economic base that could continue pursuing Nazi goals long aft er the defeat of Germany. Armaments minister Speer conceded that there were weapons develop­ m ent programs that he knew nothing about. He admitted that an SS scheme in 1944 to construct a secret weapons plant requiring 3,500 con­ centration camp workers had been concealed from him. Speer even hinted at the possibility of secret weapons that “were secretly produced by the SS toward the end of the war and concealed from me.” While the V-2 rocket program began under the aegis of the German A rmy, and the ME-262 jet fighter under the Luft waff e, they were ulti­ mately transferred to SS control. “In short, anything that had shown any real promise as a weapon system—in particular, anything that appeared to represent a quantum leap over the then- state-of-the-art—had ended up under the oversight of the SS,” noted Nick Cook, an aviation editor and aerospace con sul tant to Jane’s Defence Weekly .

Other notable secret Nazi weapons nearing completion in 1945 in­ cl uded the Messerschmitt-163 Komet and the vertically launched Natter rocket fi ghters, the jet-powered fl ying wing Horten Ho-IX and the delta-winged Lippisch DM-1. It has been noted that some of top-secret Nazi weaponry development was moved outside Germany, to such places as Blizna, Poland—the same area where Allied aircrews first encountered the infamous “foo-fi ghters,” small glowing balls of light that shadowed Allied bombers. Th e “foo-fi ghters” soon caught the attention of the American news media. Th e New York Times, on December 13, 1944, re­ ported news authorized by the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expe­ ditionary Force. “Floating Mystery Ball Is New Nazi Air Weapon,” read the headline. Th e story stated: Airmen of the American Air Force report that they are encountering silver-colored spheres in the air over German territory. Th e spheres are encountered either singly or in clusters. Sometimes they are semi- translucent. Th e n ew device, apparently an air defense weapon, resembles the huge glass balls that adorn Christmas trees. Th ere was no informa­ tion available as to what holds them up like stars in the sky, what is in them or what their purpose is supposed to be. According to author Renato Vesco, the “foo-fighters” were actually the Feuerball, or fire ball, which was “a highly original fl ying machine . . . circular and armored, more or less resembling the shell of a tortoise, and was powered by a special turbojet engine, also fl at and circular, whose principles of operation . . . generated a great halo of luminous flames . . . . Radio-controlled at the moment of takeoff , i t then automatically followed enemy aircraft , attracted by their exhaust flames, and approached close enough without collision to wreck their radar gear.” Vesco claimed that the basic principles of the Feuerball were later applied to a “symmetrical"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"NAZI WONDER WEAPONS 55 circular aircraft” known as the Kugelblitz, or ball lightning, automatic fighter that became an “authentic antecedent of the present- day fl ying saucers.” He said this innovative craft was destroyed aft er a “single lucky wartime mission” by retreating SS troops. Even though the public has been conditioned for more than sixty years t o dismiss any notion of fl ying saucers, or UFOs, the accumulation of evi­ dence available today makes it impossible to reject the reality of such craft out of hand. Obviously, the Nazis were experimenting with new and ex­ otic energy technology. Th e extraordinary development of the Feuerball may have provided the fi rst public glimpse into the heart of Nazi super- science. Several writers have produced articles about the Nazi development of fly ing saucers. British author W. A. Harbinson claimed that he got his ideas aft er discovering postwar German articles mentioning a former Luft waff e engineer, Flugkapitan Rudolph Schriever. According to infor­ mation gleaned by Harbinson from articles in Der Spiegel, Bild am Son - ntag, Luftfahrt International, and other German publications, Schriever cla imed to have designed a “fl ying top” prototype in 1941, which was ac­ tually test- fl own in June 1942. In 1944, Schriever said he constructed a larger, jet version of his circular craft , with the help of scientists Klaus Habermohl, Otto Miethe, and an Italian, Dr. Giuseppe Belluzzo. Draw­ ings of this saucer were published in the 1959 British book German Secret Weapons of the Second World War and Th eir Later Development, by Major Rudolph Lusar, an engineer who worked in the German Reichs-Patent Offi ce and had access to many original plans and documents. Lusar de­ scribed the saucer as a ring of separate disks carrying adjustable jets rotat­ ing around a fixed cockpit. Th e entire craft had a height of 105 feet and could fl y vertically or horizontally, depending on the positioning of the jets. Schriever later said the Allied advance into Germany put an end to his “fl y ing disc” experiments, with all equipment and designs lost or destroyed. However, a Georg Klein told the postwar German press that he had wit­ nessed the Schriever disc, or something like it, test-fl own in February 1945. Schriever reportedly died in the late 1950s and, according to a 1975 is­ su e of Luft fahrt International, notes and sketches related to a large fl ying"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"56 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH saucer were found in his eff ects. Th e periodical also stated that Schriever maintained until his death that his original saucer concept must have been made operational prior to war’s end. Th is possibility is acknowledged by British author Brian Ford, who wrote, “Th ere are supposed to have been ‘flying saucers’ too, which were near the final stages of development, and indeed it may be that some progress was made toward the construc­ tion of small, disc-like aircraft , but the results were destroyed, apparent ly before they fell into enemy hands.” Th ese acc ounts would seem to be corroborated by a CIA report dated May 27, 1954. As reported in Nick Redfern’s 1998 book, The FBI Files: Th e FBI’s UFO Top Secrets Exposed, the document stated, “A German newspa­ per (not further identified) recently published an interview with Georg Klein, famous German engineer and aircraft expert, describing the ex­ perimental construction of ‘fl ying saucers’ carried out by him from 1941 to 1945. Klein stated he was present when, in 1945, the first piloted ‘fl y­ ing saucer’ took off and reached a speed of 1,300 miles per hour within three minutes. Th e experiments resulted in three designs—one designed by Miethe was a disk- shaped aircraft , 135 feet in diameter, which did not rotate; another, designed by Habermohl and Schriever, consisted of a large rotating ring, in the center of which was a round, stationary cabin for the crew. When the Soviets occupied Prague, the Germans destroyed every trace of the ‘fl ying saucer’ project and nothing more was heard of Habermohl and his assistants. Schriever recently died in Bremen, where he had been living. In Breslau, the Soviets managed to capture one of the saucers built by Miethe, who escaped to France. He is reportedly in the USA at present.” Another candidate for inventor of a German UFO is the Austrian s cientist Victor Schauberger, who, aft er being kidnapped by the Nazis, reportedly designed a number of “fl ying discs” in 1940, using a fl ameless and smokeless form of electromagnetic propulsion called “diamagnet­ ism.” Schauberger reportedly worked for the U.S. government for a short time aft er the war before dying of natural causes. Prior to his death, he was quoted as saying, “Th ey took everything from me. Everything.” No one knows for certain if he meant the Nazis or the Allies.

In mid-1947, two years after the war ended, “fly ing saucers” were being reported both in Europe and America. General Twining wrote that the “phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fi ctitious.” He went on to describe attributes of such discs as having “extreme rates of climb, maneuverability (particularly in roll), and action which must be considered evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and ra­ dar, lend[ing] belief to the possibility that some of the objects are control­ led either manually, automatically or remotely.” Allowing a small glimpse into the reality of such radical technology, T wining concluded, “It is possible within the present U.S. knowledge— provided extensive detailed development is undertaken—to construct a pi loted aircraft which has the general description of the object [described above] which would be capable of an approximate range of 7,000 miles at subsonic speeds.” If technical knowledge in the 1940s was advanced enough to construct a w orkable fl ying saucer, the public was never to hear about it. Beginning in the late 1940s, a national security “lid” was placed on the subject. But it is fascinating to recall that one of the first and best documented ca ses of mysterious abductions took place in September 1961, when Betty and Barney Hill under hypnosis recalled being taken aboard a circular craft manned by men in black uniforms. Barney Hill described the leader as a “German Nazi” wearing a shiny black jacket, scarf, and cap. Before anyone rushes out to proclaim that all UFOs are really secret N azi technology, serious attention should be given to the wealth of public literature that clearly indicates that while some saucers, especially in the years following World War II, may indeed have been Nazi test vehicles, any objective review of the material suggests the presence of some uncon­ ventional source as well. Another amazing—and chilling—aspect of Nazi technology involved t heir development of nuclear weapons. Researcher and author Farrell con­ cluded from new material released from the former East Germany that the Nazis were much closer to developing an atomic bomb than previ­ ously accepted by postwar writers. He characterized the idea that the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"58 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Germans had neither the talent nor the capability to construct an opera­ tional atomic bomb—recall the well-known story of the destruction of the heavy-water plant in Norway by commandos—an “Allied Legend” designed to distract the public from a horrible reality. “[A]ll the evidence points to the conclusion that there was a large, very well-funded, and very secret German isotope- enrichment program during the war, a program successfully disguised during the war by the Nazis and covered up aft er the war by the Allied Legend,” wrote Farrell, aft er concluding that the conventional story that “the German failure to obtain the atom bomb because they never had a functioning reactor is simply utter scientific non­ sense because a reactor is needed only if one wants to produce plutonium. It is an unneeded, and expensive, development, if one only wants to make a uranium A-bomb [emphasis in the original].” Plus, there is the cryptic remark made by Kurt Diebner, a physicist in­ v olved with the Nazi atomic bomb project. Surreptitiously recorded by British intelligence during postwar internment at Farm Hall, En gland, Diebner mentioned a “photochemical pro cess” to enrich uranium bypass­ ing the need for a centrifuge. Since no modern researcher understands what pro cess was referred to by Diebner, this may mean that the Nazis discovered a method of isotope separation and uranium enrichment that even now remains classifi ed. Adding to the idea that the Nazis already had perfected a method of e nriching uranium are the words of nuclear scientist Karl Wirtz, who was also secretly taped at Farm Hall. Upon learning of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Otto Hahn, who discovered atomic fi ssion, com­ mented, “Th ey can only have done that if they have uranium isotope sepa­ ration.” To which Wirtz agreed by responding, “Th ey have it too,” a clear indication that he knew of a German separation pro cess. Farrell noted, “Th us, there is suffi cient reason, due to the science of bomb-making and the political and military realities of the war aft er America’s entry, that the Germans took the decision to develop only a uranium bomb, since that aff orded the best, most direct, and technologically least complicated route to acquisition of a bomb.” Based on his research, Farrell wrote, “American progress in the pluto­"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"NAZI WONDER WEAPONS 59 nium bomb, from the moment [physicist Enrico] Fermi successfully com­ pleted and tested a functioning reactor in the squash court at the University of Chicago, appeared to be running fairly smoothly, until fairly late in the war, when it was discovered that in order to make a bomb from pluto­ nium, the critical mass would have to be assembled much faster than any existing Allied fuse technologies could accomplish. Moreover, there was so little margin of error, since the fuses in an implosion device would have to fire as close to simultaneously as possible, that Allied engineers began to despair of making a plutonium bomb work . . . . I believe a strong prima f acie case has been outlined that Nazi Germany developed and success­ fully tested, and perhaps used, a uranium atom bomb before the end of World War II,” Farrell concluded. Farrell was not alone in this assessment. In 2005, Berlin historian R ainer Karlsch, in a book titled Hitlers Bombe, claimed that the Nazis indeed tested nuclear weapons on Rugen Island near Ohrdruf, Th uringia, site of a subsidiary concentration camp to the infamous Buchenwald. Re­ portedly, many prisoners were killed during these tests, which were con­ ducted under the supervision of the SS. Karlsch’s primary evidence consists of “vouchers” for “tests” and a patent for a plutonium weapon dated 1941. He also claimed to have found traces of radioactivity in soil from the site. However, in February 2006, the German government re­ ported no abnormal radiation levels at the site, even aft er taking into account elevated levels due to the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Rus sia. Although Nazi armaments minister Speer was questioned about a mys­ t erious blast at Ohrdruf during the Nuremberg war crimes trials, no sig­ nifi cant information on a nuclear test was found, either because it never happened or because a postwar cover-up was quite successful. Mainstream historians, at the mercy of carefully concocted cover sto­ r ies in both Germany and the USA, have remained skeptical that Nazi scientists could have advanced their nuclear knowledge to the point of ac­ tual testing. However, evidence that the Nazis were planning a nuclear strike near the end of the war came from varied sources, including a news article in the Wa s h i n g t o n Po s t dated June 29, 1945, which reported on an amazing find by Allied troops in Norway:"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"60 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH R.A.F. [Royal Air Force] offi ce rs said today that the Germans had nearly completed preparations for bombing New York from a “colos­ sal air field” near Oslo when the war ended. Forty giant bombers with a 7,000-mile range were found on this ba se—“the largest Luft waff e field I have ever seen,” one offi cer said. Th e y were a new type bomber developed by Heinkel. Th ey now are being dismantled for study. German ground crews said the planes were held in readiness for a mission to New York. It should also be noted that the Nazis had two prototypes of the Junkers- 390, a massive six- engine modification of the Junkers-290, known to have made flights to Japanese bases in Manchuria. In late 1944, one JU-390 was fl o wn from a base in Bordeaux, France, to within twelve miles of New York City, snapped photographs of the sky­ line, and returned—a nonstop fl ight of thirty-two hours. What weapon was to be transported by these massive bombers? Aft er t he war, authorities discovered a feasibility study by the German Luft ­ waff e detailing the blast eff ects of an atomic bomb over New York’s Man­ hattan Island. Th e Nazi study was based on an atomic bomb in the fi ft een- to seventeen-kiloton range, approximately the same yield as the Little Boy uranium bomb dropped on Hiroshima. If Nazi Germany had a nuclear weapon, they surely must have tested it, a nd a collection of disparate sources seems to indicate this was accom­ plished. Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, in a “Political Testament” writ­ ten shortly before his death at the hands of partisans in April 1945, stated, “Th e wonder weapons are the hope. It is laughable and senseless for us to threaten at this moment, without a basis in reality for these threats. Th e well-known mass destruction bombs are nearly ready. In only a few days, with the utmost meticulous intelligence, Hitler will probably execute this fearful blow, because he will have full confi dence . . . . It appears there are t hree bombs—and each has an astonishing operation. Th e construction of each is fearfully complex and of a lengthy time of completion.” Mussolini’s mention of three bombs is intriguing because of a state­ m ent of a former Russian military translator who served on the staff of Marshal Rodion Malinovsky, the offi cer who took Japan’s surrender to"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"NAZI WONDER WEAPONS 61 the Soviet Union in 1945. As reported by the German magazine Der Spiegel in 1992, Piotr Titarenko had written a letter to the Communist Party Central Committee, in which he stated that the three atomic bombs were dropped on Japan. One of these, dropped on Nagasaki prior to the blast of August 9, 1945, failed to detonate and subsequently was given to the Soviet Union by Japanese offi cials. If Titarenko’s account is accurate, this would mean that America had three atomic bombs on hand in the sum­ mer of 1945. Yet, a report to Manhattan Project leader Robert Oppen­ heimer just days aft er President Roo sevelt died on April 12, 1945, stated that not enough enriched uranium existed to create a viable critical mass for even one atomic bomb. News stories in Britain point to a possible Nazi atomic bomb test in 1 944. An August 11, 1945, article in London’s Daily Telegraph reported, “Britain prepared for the possibility of an atomic bomb attack on this country by Germany in August 1944. It can now be disclosed that details of the expected effect of such a bomb were revealed in a highly secret memorandum which was sent that summer to the chiefs of Scotland Yard, chief constables of provincial forces and senior offi cials of the defense ser­ vices.” Another odd story also was published in En gland’s Daily Mail on October 14, 1944, under the headline “Berlin Is ‘Silent’ 60 Hours, Still No Phones.” Th e story, filed by a correspondent from Stockholm, stated that all telephone service in Berlin had been interrupted for three days with “no explanation for the hold-up, which has lasted longer than on any previous occasion.” Th e story ended by saying, “It is pointed out, more­ over, in responsible quarters that if the stoppage were purely the technical result of bomb damage, as the Germans claimed, it should have been re­ paired by now.” A modern readership would know that such disruption can be caused by the electromagnetic pulse associated with a nuclear deto­ nation. Other intriguing hints of a German atomic test came in the form of t hree separate intelligence reports. A once-classifi ed U.S. military intelli­ gence report dated August 19, 1945, and titled “Investigations, Research, Developments and Practical Use of the German Atomic Bomb” details the experience of a German pilot named Hans Zinsser, a Flak rocket ex­ pert, while piloting a Heinkel bomber over northern Germany.

As we drew nearer [to the point of explosion], the more fearsome was the devastation. The grass had the same color as leather. Th e few trees that still stood upright had no more leaves.” Romersa’s credibility is supported by the fact that he eventually came t o the United States, where he was granted a high-security clearance.

Moreover, it is a fact that the same type of war material was tried out in the Crimea too. At that time the Rus sians claimed that this was poison gas, and protested that if Ger­ many were ever again to use it, Rus sia, too, would use poison gas.” . . . Recently the British authorities warned their people of the possibility that they might undergo attack by German atom- splitting bombs. Th e American authorities have likewise warned that the American east coast might be the area chosen for a blind attack by some sort of flying bomb . . . . Th e Japanese report then goes into a remarkably accurate description of the splitting of the atom, ending with the statement, “[T]he German atom-splitting device is the Neuman disintegrator. Enormous energy is directed into the central part of the atom and this generates an atomic pressure of several tens of thousands of tons per square inch. Th is device can split the relatively unstable atoms of such elements as uranium. More­ over, it brings into being a store of explosive atomic energy. . . . Th a t is, a bomb deriving its force from the release of atomic energy.” Some elements of the Japanese report were obviously in error, such as t he confusion over descriptions of a fi ssion versus a fusion bomb and the date of the Kursk off ensive, which did not begin until July 5, 1943. Mis­ takes notwithstanding, it is clear that Japanese intelligence was firmly convinced that the Germans had used a revolutionary type of weapon on the Eastern Front. But if the Nazis had deployed a tactical nuke or other exotic weapon on t he Eastern Front, why would the Soviets have kept such an attack secret? Farrell pointed out that had Nazi Germany used such a weapon, it would most likely have been against the Rus sians, whom the Nazis considered “subhuman,” in Nazi ideology. Fully one-half of the 50 million casualties of the war occurred in Rus sia, and several massive explosions, such as the one that destroyed a section of Sevastopol, have never been fully explained. It was announced that a hundred-foot below-ground ammunition bunker"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"NAZI WONDER WEAPONS 65 was destroyed aft er being struck by a lucky shot from Dora, a 31 1 ⁄ 2 - inch German railway gun considered the largest in the world. Such attacks were never reported by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, due to t he fear of losing control over a panicked and war-weary Rus sian popula­ tion. Th e use of a super-weapon on the Eastern Front also might explain why more is not known about this issue. Accurate war news from Rus sia was extremely hard to come by during the war and grew more so during the Cold War. To make public the use of a nuclear or unconventional weapon “would have been a propaganda disaster for Stalin’s government,” noted Farrell. “Faced with an enemy of superior tactical and operational competence in conventional arms, the Red Army oft en had to resort to threats of execution against its own soldiers just to maintain order and discipline in its ranks and prevent mass desertion. Ac knowledgment of the existence and use of such weapons by the mortal enemy of Commu­ nist Rus sia could conceivably have ruined Rus sian morale and cost Stalin the war, and perhaps even toppled his government.” I F T H E N A ZIS had operational atomic weapons, is it possible they were transferred to the United States? Documents exist showing that America’s secret development of the atomic bomb, the Manhattan Project, could not have produced enough enriched uranium to make a bomb by mid-1945. Since only a plutonium bomb was tested at Alamogordo, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945, researchers have wondered where America acquired the uranium bombs dropped on Japan less than a month later. Some have speculated that the United States used a Nazi bomb or used Nazi enriched uranium to manufacture its bombs. Th e T rinity bomb exploded near Alamogordo, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945, was a plutonium bomb. Why then would the United States first drop the Little Boy, an untested uranium bomb, on Japan on August 6, 1945? “A rational explanation is [that] ‘Little Boy’ was not tested by the Americans because . . . [t]he Americans did not need to test it, because its German designers already had,” surmised Farrell. Th is idea is supported by the statement of German authors Edgar Meyer and Th omas Mehner"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"66 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH that J. Robert Oppenheimer, the “father of the atomic bomb,” maintained that the bomb dropped on Japan was of “German provenance.” Of course, this idea would fl y in the face of the long- accepted Allied Legend that Germany simply couldn’t manufacture an atomic bomb by the war’s end. Where could the Nazis have obtained enriched uranium for such a bo mb? One potential source was the secure underground laboratory of Baron Manfred von Ardenne, built in Lichterfelde outside Berlin, which contained a 2-million-volt electrostatic generator and a cyclotron. In 1941, von Ardenne, along with Fritz Houtermans, had calculated the critical mass needed to create U-235. It should be noted that Hitler visited the laboratory toward the end of the war, at a time when he spoke enthusiasti­ cally of a new wonder weapon that would turn the tide in Germany’s favor. Some researchers contend that the Nazi development of a uranium bo mb was kept secret because the work was not part of the German military- industrial system but hidden within the German Postal Service. According to Carter Plymton Hydrick, author of a well-documented book Critical Mass: How Nazi Germany Surrendered Enriched Uranium for the United States’ Atomic Bomb , “[A]ll of Ardenne’s facilities . . . were provided by and ongoing funding made available through, the patronage of one man, Reich minister of posts and a member of the Reich President’s Research Council on Nuclear Aff airs, Wilhelm Ohnesorge.” Reportedly, Hitler once remarked that while his party and military l eadership worried about how to win the war, it was his postal minister who brought him the solution. Farrell explained that the Reichspost was “awash with money, and c ould therefore have provided some of the massive funding necessary to the [uranium enrichment] project, a true ‘black budget’ operation in every sense.” Another source may have been a giant synthetic-rubber plant built by I. G. Farben next to Auschwitz, the notorious death camp. Th e site was chosen for its proximity to transportation hubs, both rail lines and rivers, as well as the nearby supply of slave labor found at the Auschwitz camp. Th is site probably was also selected with the idea that the Allies would not bomb a concentration camp, a supposition that proved correct. Yet, de­"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"NAZI WONDER WEAPONS 67 spite the facts—established during the Nuremberg trials—that more than $2 billion in today’s dollars were spent; that 300,000 slave laborers had been used in both the construction and operation of this plant; and that it had consumed more electricity than Berlin, not one pound of buna, or synthetic rubber, was ever produced. So, what was produced? “Th e f acility has all of the characteristics of a uranium enrichment plant,” noted Hydrick, adding, “the various compo­ nents of the German atomic bomb eff orts could have been implemented with a high degree of secrecy, even from other high-level Nazis, given Bor- mann’s close-knit relationships with Ohnesorge; Schmitz, who was chief of I. G. Farben; [Rudolf ] Hoess, the commandant of Auschwitz; and Heinrich Mueller, who, among his many other duties as head of the Gestapo, oversaw the supplying of forced laborers to Auschwitz.” A theory has been off e red that, late in the war, certain Nazis arranged the transfer of enriched uranium to the United States in exchange for im­ munity from prosecution. At the heart of this transfer theory lies the saga of a Nazi submarine—the U-234. Unterseeboot-234 was originally designed as a mine-layer but was con­ v erted to a cargo carrier prior to its only mission into enemy waters: the last German shipment to its ally, Japan. It sailed from Kiel in March 1945, with a most unusual cargo consisting of several high-level German offi ­ cials, including Dr. Heinz Schlicke, the inventor of fuses for atomic bombs, and two Japanese offi cers—Air Force Colonel Genzo Shosi and Navy Captain Hideo Tomonaga. Also listed on the boat’s manifest of 240 metric tons of cargo were two dismantled ME-262 jet fighters, ten gold-lined cylinders containing 560 kilograms of uranium oxide, wooden barrels of “water,” and infrared proximity fuses. On May 14, 1945, six days aft e r the German surrender, the U-234 was intercepted by the USS Sutton and taken into captivity. Oddly enough, the sub had been overfl own several times by Allied aircraft but never fired upon. Th e circumstances implied a preplanned meeting and surrender. Here the mystery began. Who issued the orders for this enemy sub to sur­ render, and why to the Americans? Upon arrival at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, it appeared that some of the boat’s cargo was missing. Th e t wo Japanese offi cers, aft er learning that the ship’s captain planned"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"68 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH to surrender, had committed suicide and were buried at sea with full hon­ ors. But, suspiciously, the two ME-262s were missing, as well as the ura­ nium oxide. In fact, when the U.S. Navy prepared its own manifest for the U-234, there was no accounting for seventy tons of cargo. Dr. Velma Hunt, a Colorado environmental scientist, said she uncov­ er ed information that the U-boat made a secret stop at South Portland, Maine, sometime between May 14 and May 17, 1945, where the cargo in question could have been unloaded. Th ere has been controversy as to whether this uranium had been enriched enough for use as a weapon. Cook noted that the gold-lined cylinders indicated the uranium was e mitting gamma radiation, which meant the normally harmless uranium oxide had been brought to enrichment through the use of a working nu­ clear reactor. “And yet, offi cially, there had been no nuclear reactor in Germany capable of fulfilling this task,” wrote Cook. “[At least] not in Speer’s orbit of operations.” Farrell further explains, “The use o f gold-lined cylinders is explainable by the fact that uranium, a highly corrosive metal, is easily contaminated if it comes into contact with other unstable elements. Gold, whose radioactive shielding properties are as great as lead, is also, unlike lead, a highly pure and stable element, and is therefore the element of choice when storing or ship­ ping highly enriched and pure uranium for long periods of time, such as a voyage. Th us, the uranium oxide on board the U-234 was highly enriched uranium , and most likely, highly enriched U-235, the last stage, perhaps, before being reduced to weapons grade or to metalicization for a bomb (if it was already in weapons grade purity) [emphasis in the original].” Adding weight to Farrell’s deduction is an anecdote regarding the Ger­ ma n crew of the U-234. Some crew members were amused when they saw the Japanese officers bring on board cargo marked “U-235.” Th ey appar­ ently thought their Japanese guests couldn’t even get the number of the boat correct. Some now believe the labels indicated the presence of ura­ nium 235, the only isotope found in nature that has the ability to cause an expanding fi ssion chain reaction—in other words, the element needed for a uranium fi ssion bomb. Uranium that has undergone an extraction pro­ cess to boost its U-235 proportion is known as enriched uranium. Wolfgang Hirschfeld, radioman on the U-234, stated the submarine’s"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"NAZI WONDER WEAPONS 69 orders were “only to sail on the orders of the highest level. Fuehrer HQ.” He also revealed aft er the war that crew members believed Japan had suc­ ceeded in testing an atomic weapon before their departure from Germany in March 1945. Th e U-234 met an inglorious end in November 1947, when it was used as a torpedo target and sunk off Cape Cod. Hydrick published copies of documents from the National Archives to s how a connection between the Manhattan Project and the U-234. One such document is a secret cable from the commander of naval operations directing that a three-man party take possession of the sub’s cargo. In ad­ dition to two naval offi cers was the name of Major John E. Vance with the Army Corps of Engineers, the department of the army under which the Manhattan Project operated. A few days after the visit by Vance, a manifest of the cargo indicated t he uranium was no longer in navy possession. Furthermore, telep hone transcripts between Manhattan intelligence offi cers about a week later stated a captured shipment of uranium powder was being tested by a per­ son identifi ed only as “Vance.” “Th at there could have been another ‘Vance’ who was working with uranium powder—especially ‘captured’ uranium powder—is improbable,” noted Hydrick. But author Henry Stevens found an even more disturbing cover-up. Aft e r receiving a statement from the National Archives denying that any canisters containing fi ssionable material was onboard the U-234, Stevens, recalling that the submarine had surrendered to the USS Sutton, wrote to the Naval Historical Center at the Washington Navy Yard requesting a cargo manifest from the U-234 in the files of the Sutton . For a $5 micro­ fiche charge, Stevens received the manifest that was identical to the one from the National Archives except that the uranium oxide canisters were listed. Th is discrepancy in the manifests can only be explained by some­ one altering the documents. A plutonium bomb, such as the one Manhattan scientists were devel­ o ping, required a critical mass to be achieved within 1/3000th of a sec­ ond, a speed far exceeding the capabilities of fuses available at that time. According to Farrell, there is evidence to support the idea that the neces­ sary fuses were obtained from U-234 passenger Dr. Schlicke. A message from the chief of Naval Operations to the authorities in Portsmouth,"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"70 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH where the U-234 was taken aft er its surrender, indicated that Dr. Schlicke along with his fuses were to be taken to Washington accompanied by na­ val offi cers. Once there, the doctor was scheduled to present a lecture on his fuses in the presence of a “Mr. Alvarez,” apparently meaning Dr. Luis Walter Alvarez, the man who is credited with producing fuses for the plu­ tonium bomb. Alvarez and his student Lawrence Johnson are credited with designing the exploding-bridgewire detonators for the spherical im­ plosives used in the Trinity bomb test as well as the Nagasaki bomb. On March 3, 1945, President Roo sevelt received an ominous memo f rom Senator James F. Byrnes, a Democrat from South Carolina and a longtime confi dant to the president. Th is “Memorandum for the Presi­ dent” stated, “I understand that the expenditures for the Manhattan Project are approaching 2 billion dollars with no definite assurance yet of produc­ tion . . . . Even eminent scientists may continue a project rather than con­ ced e its failure.” Byrnes, who went on to become a secretary of state and a Supreme Court justice, was voicing the concern of many that the atom bomb project was foundering and might even prove a failure. Byrnes may have been aware of a letter dated December 28, 1944, in which Eric Jette, chief metallurgist at Los Alamos, expressed reservations over the lack of suffi cient amounts of uranium for the atomic bomb. He wrote, “A study of the shipment of [weapons grade uranium] for the past three months shows the following . . . : At present rate we will have 10 kilos by February 7 and 15 kilos about May 1.” According to Hydrick, Edward Hammel, a metallurgist who worked at Los Alamos, where enriched uranium was made into material for the atomic bomb, reported that very little enriched uranium was received there until less than a month before the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Little Boy, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, carried 64.15 kilograms o f enriched uranium, virtually the entire quantity that could have been produced since mid-1944 by the enrichment facilities at Oak Ridge, Ten­ nessee, even working around the clock. One explanation for the lack of enriched uranium was that some of this fissionable material had been used to produce plutonium in Enrico Fermi’s breeder reactors at Hanford, Washington. Th e m ounting pressure on Manhattan Project directors to produce a"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"NAZI WONDER WEAPONS 71 bomb before the planned invasion of the Japanese home islands must have been terrifi c. If the submarine’s cargo did indeed include U-235 and Dr. Schlicke’s fuses, its acquisition by the United States solved two pressing problems of the Manhattan atomic bomb project—a lack of suffi cient amounts of uranium and adequate fuses. Th e American bomb-makers may have been greatly relieved that the two major problems facing the Manhattan Project were solved with the surrender of the U-234. “Th e fact that U-234 arrived on American soil carrying 560 kilograms of ura­ nium that was enriched and went on to be used in the bombs that were dropped on Japan can scarcely be argued any longer except by th ose who refuse to consider the evidence,” concluded Hydrick. While it may remain a controversy whether the acquisition of the U-234 was a fortuitous cap­ ture or the planned transfer of technology from Germany to the United States, the evidence strongly indicates the latter. If additional uranium was obtained from the U-234, this would have p rovided more than could ever have been produced by the Manhattan Project, and the equivalent of about eight Hiroshima bombs. It also means the German nuclear program was much further advanced than believed by conventional historians. In late July 1945, atomic bomb components— and perhaps additional German uranium bombs—were delivered to Tin­ ian Island in the Pacific following a secret and rushed voyage from California by the USS Indianapolis. Aft er delivering its deadly cargo, this Portland- class heavy cruiser suff ered the largest single at-sea loss of life in U.S. naval history and became the last American ship sunk in World War II aft er being torpedoed by a Japanese submarine in the Philippines. Farrell voiced the suspicion that the I ndianapolis may have delivered much more than America’s atomic bomb—it may have carried a German bomb in addition to its cargo of uranium and fuses. He was supported by Stevens, who wrote that the “unexploded German atomic bombs fell into the hands of the Americans at the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, two months before the ‘first’ explosion of an atomic weapon in the New Mexico desert. What a present for the Americans! All they did was to put new tail fins on the bombs, repaint them, and drop them on Japan. Natu­ rally, the American scientists involved with the Manhattan Project were given credit.”"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"72 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH But, if the Nazis had developed a working atomic bomb, why was it not used as Allied armies closed in on Germany? One answer seems to be that they did not have a reliable delivery system in place. Th e Nazis’ V-3, a smooth-bore 150-mm gun dubbed the Centipede, designed to launch large-finned shells into London, along with its multistage A-10 rocket, was still undependable. Witkowski voiced his suspicions that the fatal flight of Lieutenant Joseph Kennedy, older brother to the future presi­ dent, might have been an ill-fated attempt to destroy the V-3 complex at Mimoyecques, France. Th e giant airfi eld in Norway, home to the massive six-engine bombers, had not yet been completed. Th is i dea was echoed by Stevens, who became convinced that the Th ird Reich produced an atomic bomb. “Th e Germans did make atomic bombs,” he stated emphatically. “Not only did they make atomic bombs, they made uranium as well as plutonium bombs and other atomic weapons which remain somewhat of a mystery. What the Germans could not do, in these dying days of the Third Reich, was to match up one of these nuclear weap­ ons with an eff ective delivery system. The reasons for this diff er with each weapon, individually, and run the [gamut] from mistake to treachery to incompetence.” One thought that must have crossed the minds of Nazi leaders was the t otal destruction of Germany that would have resulted from the use of a nuclear weapon. Th e devastation of London or New York would not have materially altered the course of the war in the spring of 1945. And the retaliation of the Allies would have been unimaginable. Further, high-ranking Nazis, such as Hitler’s secretary Martin Bormann, who by war’s end had become the second most powerful man in Nazi Germany, realized the war was lost, and used advanced technology as a bargaining chip with the Western allies. Hydrick proposed just that intriguing possibility: that the U-234 was p urposely handed over to U.S. authorities on the order of Bormann in ex­ change for immunity as part of a covert plan for the continuation of Nazi research. Although there was criticism over Hydrick’s technical descrip­ tions of both the atomic bomb and its detonators, his mass of documenta­ tion concerning the transfer of nuclear technology from Germany to"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"NAZI WONDER WEAPONS 73 America is compelling. Hydrick’s claim is supported by Farrell, who wrote, “I have argued that most likely all of it [extra uranium and even atom bombs] came from Nazi Germany, courtesy of Nazi Party Reichsleiter Bor­ mann and SS Obergruppenfuehrer Hans Kammler.” But Farrell had an even more horrifying thought about why the Nazis d id not drop an atomic bomb. Considering Nazi research into quantum physics and energy manipulation, Farrell speculated that their atomic bombs “were being developed as detonators for something far more de­ structive.” Since only a few scattered plans to Nazi super-science were re­ covered aft er the war, the question arises, “What became of their advanced technology?” There has never been a public answer. H OW E V ER , T H E A NS W E R to this question may be found by studying the man in charge of Germany’s high-tech weapons programs, Dr. Engineer Hans Kammler. Kammler, whose name has been largely lost to history, may have played a la rge role in developing and hiding away the technology secrets of Hit- ler’s Th ird Reich. Kammler did not have higher purposes in mind when he set out to develop rockets and energy manipulation. He was searching for new weapons. Born in 1901, Kammler completed engineering studies at a technical u niversity and began working for the German Air Ministry. Aft er joining the Nazi SS, he managed finances and construction for the SS until 1942, when he became chief of Group C under the Wirtschaft s und Verwal­ tungshauptamt, or the Economic and Administrative Central Offi ce (W VHA) of the SS, one of fi ve key branches of the Black Shirts. Th is branch controlled all economic enterprises as well as all concentration and extermination camps. Beginning in 1943, Kammler took control of all “special tasks,” which included “Kammler special construction”—the cre­ ation of secret underground facilities as well as exotic weapons programs. His offi cial title was SS Obergruppenfuehrer, or lieutenant general, and he had worked his way up to command the Th ird Reich’s most precious war time secrets."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"74 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH In mid-1943, SS chief Heinrich Himmler sent a letter to armaments minister Speer. “With this letter, I inform you that I, as SS Reichsfuehrer . . . do hereby take charge of the manufacture of the A-4 instrument,” it read. Th e A-4 rocket was later designated by Hitler as the V-2. Himmler then placed Kammler in charge of the project, one of Germany’s most secret high-tech weapons systems. Due to the devastation brought on by inces­ sant Allied air raids, by the end of 1944, Kammler had taken control of weapons research as well as the construction of underground factories and concentration camps. “Th us— just a few weeks before the end of the war—he had become commissioner general for all important weapons,” wrote Speer, who later bemoaned the fact that Himmler’s SS gradually assumed total control over Germany’s weaponry, production, and research. In connection with his new responsibilities, Kammler created an SS S onderkommando, or special command, independent from the normal German military and bureaucracy. “What Kammler had established was a ‘special projects offi ce,’ a forerunner of the entity that had been run by the bright young colonels of the USAF’s stealth program in the 1970s and 1980s,” noted Cook. It was “a place of vision, where imagination could run free, unfettered by the restraints of accountability. Exactly the kind of place, in fact, you’d expect to find anti- gravity technology, if such an im­ possible thing existed.” Kammler also had use of computer technology that was only dreamed of in American science fi ction stories. “Dr. Kammler had the benefi t of knowledge, hardware and soft ware that was developed by the computing pioneer, Dr. Konrad Zuse,” wrote Stevens. “In spite of everything churned out by the computer industry and ‘history’ as we know it, Dr. Zuse built the first digital computer in 1938 and the first programmable soft ware language, Plankaikuel. He also was instrumental in developing magnetic tape as a computer storage medium. By 1944 the Germans were using computers, the Zuse-built Z-3, to plot the course of ballistic attack by the V-2 at Peenemunde and Nordhausen.” Stevens, who spent more than fif­ teen years researching the Reich’s most secret technology, including fl ying saucers, wrote, “By the end of the war a whole new research and produc­ tion command and control structure had been set up which reduced or"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"NAZI WONDER WEAPONS 75 replaced the fi gures we normally think of as running the Th ird Reich, such as, for instance, Hermann Goering and Albert Speer.” It was Kammler and his Sonderkommando that became the repository for the Reich’s most advanced technology, going far beyond the rockets and fl ying discs. But Kammler’s immediate concern was the V-2 rocket program. K ammler worked closely with Wernher von Braun and his superior, Luft ­ waff e Major General Walter Dornberger. Von Braun, who had been a mem­ ber of the SS since 1940, carried the rank of SS Sturmbannfuehrer, or major. Alarmed by progress on the V-2 rockets, Britain’s Bomber Command se nt 597 bombers on the night of August 16–17, 1943, to raid Peene- munde—Germany’s top-secret rocket facility built on an island at the mouth of the Oder River near the border of Germany and Poland. Because of a navigation “blunder,” much of the underground and well-camoufl aged Peenemunde site was left undamaged. Brian Ford described the results: “Even so, over 800 of the people on the island were killed . . . . After this, it w as realized that some of the facility had better be dispersed throughout Germany; thus the theoretical development facility was moved to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, development went to Nordhausen and Bleich­ erode, and the main wind-tunnel and ancillary equipment went down to Kochel, some 24 miles south of Munich. Th is was christened Wasserbau Versuchsanstalt Kochelsee—experimental waterworks project—and gave rise to the most thorough research center for long-range rocket develop­ ment that, at the time, could have been envisioned.” Mary Bennett and David S. Percy, authors of Da rk Moon: Apollo and the Whistleblowers, speculated that the British air raid on Peenemunde was designed not to knock out the V-rocket site but to force it to move to safer environs, to ensure the safety of the rocket program. Th ey showed how the raid bombed the site’s northern peninsula rather than the main facility, due to misplaced target indicators. Th ese authors noted that of the eight hundred personnel who died in the air raid, about half were mostly Rus sians from the prisoner labor force and the other half were technicians and their families. Aft er this raid, the irreplaceable Hermann Oberth was transferred to the safety of the Reinsdorf works near Witten­ berg, to continue his work."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"76 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH “Instructions from the highest level, it seems, had been to target per­ sonnel and certainly not the V-2 rocket production facilities. It was clearly CRUCIAL that these rockets, plans and parts were spared,” they stated (emphasis in original). Someone with high authority wanted this Nazi technology available to them aft er the war. Nick Cook also saw the connection between such exotic technology a nd the mysterious Hans Kammler. “Th ere was, via the Kammler trail, a mounting body of evidence that the Nazis, in their desperation to win the war, had been experimenting with a form of science the rest of the world have never remotely considered,” he wrote. “And that somewhere in this cauldron of ideas, a new technology had been born; one that was so far ahead of its time it had been suppressed for more than half a century.” One clue to what this revolutionary technology might involve was found i n the capture of physicist Walter Gerlach, one of the Nazi scientists brought to the United States aft er the war. Gerlach has been connected with the German attempts to build an atomic bomb, yet his background indicated even more esoteric knowledge. In 1921, Gerlach received a Nobel Prize, not for nuclear research but fo r magnetic spin polarization, dealing with the momentum of electrons of atoms situated in a magnetic fi eld. Such work had little to do with the atomic bomb but much to do with energ y manipulation to include anti­ gravity. In 1931, a paper titled “About Gravitation, Vortices and Waves in Ro­ ta ting Media” was published by O. C. Hilgenberg, a student of Gerlach, which indicated the focus of Gerlach’s work. “And yet, aft er the war, Ger­ lach, who died in 1979, apparently never returned to these subject mat­ ters, nor did he make any references to them; almost as if he had been forbidden to do so,” noted Cook. Interestingly, Gerlach’s wartime work diaries were confiscated by U.S. authorities and remain classifi ed today. At the turn of the current century, both Cook and the Polish military j ournalist Witkowski tracked Kammler and his top-secret Nazi energy work to the Wenzeslaus Mine, located about 215 miles west of Warsaw in Lower Silesia, near the border with Czech oslo vakia. Th is mine is in Lud­ wikowice Klodzkie, formerly Ludwigsdorf. Th e location was perfect for"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"NAZI WONDER WEAPONS 77 security purposes as it was outside Germany yet within the Greater Th ird Reich. Additionally, Kammler spoke fl uent Czech. During their journey, Witkowski revealed his access to a formerly clas­ si fied Soviet document detailing the interrogation at the end of the war of a Rudolf Schuster, who had been a member of the Reichssicher­ heitshauptamt, or Reich Central Security Offi ce, Nazi Germany’s version of the Department of Homeland Security. Schuster revealed that in June of 1944, he was transferred to a special evacuation Kommando called General Plan 1945, formed by Martin Bormann to evacuate valuable sci­ ence and technology from the Reich. Schuster, who was not privy to the plan’s overall agenda, nevertheless located much of these evacuation ac­ tivities in the area of the Wenzeslaus Mine. Schuster’s testimony, coupled with other information, convinced Cook t hat the Bormann evacuation plan had been one of the Nazis’ greatest se­ crets. “Th ere has never been any official ac knowledgment of the existence of the special evacuation Kommando,” he wrote. It was this unacknowl­ edged evacuation operation that saved the Reich’s most precious technol­ ogy. Once at the mine site, Cook and Witkowski found remnants of what once had been a secret SS testing and production facility that may have even included a giant early superconductor. In 1931, the Wenzeslaus Mine suffered an accident that caused bank­ r uptcy and a takeover by the Polish government. With the occupation of Poland, the mine was reconditioned by the Nazis as a gigantic science center. “Th e whole area, in the center of which was located the main left shaft , proved to be the interior of a deep valley, which was accessible only through two ‘mountain passes,’ ” noted Witkowski. “Since the remnants of watchtowers could be seen in them, it was obvious that the whole area had been closely guarded, and its confi guration caused that in this way the whole valley was physically cut off [from] the outside world.” Th is valley, about three hundred yards across, was bisected by rail lines, and lined with a variety of structures, concrete bunkers, and guard stations, many covered with dirt and trees to act as camoufl age. Today the site is virtually ruins and overgrown with trees and vegetation. Cook saw that “the Germans had gone to a great deal of trouble to"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"78 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH ensure that the place looked pretty much as it had always looked since mining operations began here at the turn of the last century, a clear indi­ cation that whatever had happened here during the war had been deeply secret . . . .

It had been run by the SS, had employed slave-labor and had been sealed from the outside world by a triple ring of check points and heavily armed guards.” Sporrenberg’s testimony and affi davits, the only known description of the strange experiments at the mine, were given during a postwar trial in Poland. He was found guilty of war crimes and executed. In the closing days of the war, most of the local population was evacu­ a ted westward. In fleeing the Rus sians, many of these refugees died during the fighting or froze in one of the coldest winters on record. Today, most of the local residents are newcomers with no recollection of what tran­ spired at the mine during the war. A central shaft l ed downward to the original mine as well as a labyrinth of additional underground facilities dug by Germans. But what most in­ trigued Cook and Witkowski was a huge circular concrete structure. Green camoufl age paint was still visible on the edges. Th e circular structure was formed by twelve thick columns supporting a dodecagon-shaped reinforc­ ing concrete ring about ninety feet in diameter. Initially, Witkowski thought this might be the remains of a cooling tower . He abandoned this idea once he saw cooling towers at a diff erent location on photographs of the area, taken in 1934. Next he thought of the structure as a “fly trap,” similar to those used to test helicopters and other hovering aircraft . Yet, this answer was not satisfactory either in that the researchers found a concrete duct containing thick electric cables leading to a power-generating station. Learning that high-voltage current cannot be used in mines with the potential for fl ammable gas—such as the Wen­ zeslaus Mine—Cook and Witkowski determined that the structure had nothing to do with mining but was used in connection with the strange experiments described to his captors by the SS offi cer Sporrenberg. Th ese ex periments centered around a bell-shaped object—appropriately"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"NAZI WONDER WEAPONS 79 enough codenamed Die Glocke, or the Bell—which was housed in a con­ crete chamber hundreds of feet underground. According to the research of Witkowski and Cook, the Bell was made from hard, heavy metal and cylindrical in shape with a semicircular cap and hook or clamping device on top. Huge quantities of electricity were fed into it through thick cables dropping into the housing chamber from the outside. Inside the Bell was a thermos-like tube encased in lead and filled with a metallic liquid. During operation, the Bell was covered by a ceramic material, appar­ e ntly to act as insulation. Inside, two contra-rotating cylinders filled with a mercury-like and violet-colored substance spun a vortex of energy, which emitted a strange phosphorescent blue light and made such a buzzing sound that operators nicknamed it the Bienenstock, or beehive. Due to the phosphorescent light and reports that operators suff ere d from nervous-system disruption, headaches, and a metallic taste, Witkowski con­ cluded the Bell’s operation involved iodizing radiation as well as a very strong magnetic field of energy. The scientists experimenting with the Bel l would place various plants, animals, and animal tissue within its energy field. “In the initial test period from November to December 1944, almost all the samples were destroyed,” noted Cook. “A crystalline substance formed within the tissues, destroying them from the inside; liquids, includ­ ing blood, gelled and separated into clearly distilled fractions.” Very little is known for certain about the Bell. However, it was given t he highest—and perhaps most unique—classifi cation possible in the Th ird Reich. In a few captured documents, experimenters with the Bell were said to be working on something Kriegsentscheidend, or decisive for the war. Most top-secret German weapons, including the V rockets, were classifi ed Kriegswichtig, or important to the war. One major reason that so little is known about the Bell was the loss of th e scientists involved in the project. “Th ey were taken out and shot by the SS between the 28th of April and the 4th of May, 1945,” explained Witkowski. “Records show that there were 62 of them, many of them Ger­ mans. Th ere were no survivors, but then that’s hardly surprising . . . . It’s q uite clear that someone had gone to great lengths to clean up.” Th e whole concept is a nightmare—Nazis tinkering with the building blocks of the universe. And it gets even worse."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"80 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH T O T RY A N D understand the purpose of the Bell requires a brief side trip into the amazing world of cutting-edge science and quantum physics. While discussions and articles about energy manipulation—whether termed cold fusion, antigravity, or free energy—have been generally discouraged as sci­ ence fi ction in mainstream America, many credible writers have dealt with the subject. In his 2003 book W inning the War: Advanced Weapons, Strategies, and Concepts for the Post-9/11 World , Colonel John B. Alexander noted, “A potential link between superconductor quantum mechanics and gravity has been inferred from recent quantum gravity research. Another ap­ proach to modifying gravity involved the manipulation of the quantum vacuum ZPE [Zero Point Energy found in the vacuum of space] fi eld. One proposed experiment to manipulate the ZPE involves the use of ultrahigh- intensity lasers to irradiate a magnetized vacuum. If any of these are suc­ cessful it will change energy issues on Earth and our relationship with the universe by allowing deep space travel.” Th e i dea of gaining mastery—and power—from the environment around us is nothing new. Such ideas were advanced by American physi­ cist Th omas Townsend Brown, who, in the early 1920s, experimented with antigravity based on his understanding that a charged capacitor tended to move toward a positive plate when suffi ciently energized in the hun­ dred kilovolt and upward range. Brown contended that all matter is es­ sentially an “electrical condition.” “It fact, it might be said that the concrete body of the universe is nothing more than an assemblage of en­ ergy which, in itself, is quite intangible.” Brown’s theories echoed those of U.S. electrical engineer Nicola Tesla, wh ose discovery in 1888 of the rotating magnetic fi eld led to alternating- current (AC) electricity transmission. Tesla foresaw limitless free energy by simply tapping into the Earth’s natural magnetic energy fi eld. In 1908, long before the idea of rotating magnetic fi eld s was common­ place in science, Tesla stated:"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"NAZI WONDER WEAPONS 81 Every ponderable atom is diff erentiated from a tenuous fl uid, filling all space merely by spinning motion, as a whirl of water in a calm lake. By being set in motion this fl uid, the ether, becomes gross mat­ ter. Its movement arrested, the primary substance reverts to its nor­ mal state [stillness]. It appears, then, possible for man through harnessed energy of the me dium and suitable agencies for starting and stopping ether whirls to cause matter to form and disappear. At his command, almost with­ out eff ort on his part, old worlds would vanish and new ones spring into being. He could alter the size of this planet, control its seasons, adjust its distance from the sun, guide it on its eternal journey along any path he might choose, through the depths of the universe. He could make planets collide and produce his [own] suns and stars, his heat and light, he could originate life in all its infinite forms. To cause at will the birth and death of matter would be man’s grandest deed, which would make him the master of physical creation, make him fulfill his ultimate destiny. Th e belief that antigravity or other exotic technologies were passed from the Nazis to the Allies has been further supported by sporadic peri­ odical coverage of antigravity in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Th is was at a time before the total blackout of news concerning energ y-manipulation experimentation was enforced as a “matter of national security.” In 1956, the Swiss aviation journal I nteravia Aerospace Review pub­ lished an article titled “Towards Flight Without Stress or Strain . . . or We i g h t .” Th e article carried the dateline of Washington, D.C., and stated, “Electro-gravitics research, seeking the source of gravity and its control, has reached a stage where profound implications for the entire human race begin to emerge. Perhaps the most startling and immediate im­ plications of all involve aircraft , guided missiles and free space flight of all kinds.” Th e article added, “Th ere are gravity research projects in every major country of the world. A few are over 30 years old [empha sis added].” It also mentioned that, over and above theoretical research, there was empirical research into the “study of matter in its super-cooled,"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"82 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH super-conductive state, of jet electron streams, peculiar magnetic eff ects [and] the electrical mechanics of the atom’s shell.” Th e article stated that the weight of some materials utilized in this research had been reduced by as much as 30 percent by “energizing” them. But in a premonition of what was to come, it added, “Security prevents disclosure of what precisely is meant by ‘energizing’ or in which country this work is underway.” Proving the ability of superconductors to produce antigravity eff ects , researchers at Pacific National Laboratory, in the late 1980s, cooled a ce­ ramic superconductor with liquid nitrogen and levitated a round magnet in midair. Some of the companies involved in this cutting- edge research, accord­ i ng to the Interavia Aerospace Review article, included Lear, Inc., Glenn L. Martin Company, Sperry-Rand Corporation, Bell Aircraft , Clarke Elec­ tronics Laboratories, and the U.S. General Electric Company. Th e na mes of these firms are especially noteworthy, because in his 2001 book on Zero Point energy, author Cook cited another 1956 magazine article naming aviation experts Lawrence D. Bell, George S. Trimble, and William P. Lear as stating that work was then under way with “nuclear fuels and equipment to cancel out gravity.” Th is article, from an unnamed publication and titled “Th e G-Engines Are Coming!” may have let slip mention of an incredible new technology. “All matter within the ship would be infl u enced by the ship’s gravita­ tion only,” Lear was quoted as saying. “Th is way, no matter how fast you accelerated or changed course, your body would not feel it any more than it now feels the tremendous speed and acceleration of the earth.” During the 1960s and 1970s, public discussion of energy manipulation su ch as antigravity was virtually closed off, scorned as fantasy or conspir­ acy theory. Yet, it is clear that within government and military circles, work continued secretly in this area. Could it have been based on trans­ ferred Nazi super-science? Bruce L. Cathie, a former New Zealand commercial pilot, theoreti­ cia n, and an advocate of the existence of a worldwide energy grid, wrote in 1971, “Somewhere, I knew, [my proposed energy grid] system contained a clue to the truth of [Einstein’s] Unifi ed Field which, he had postulated,"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"NAZI WONDER WEAPONS 83 permeates all of existence. I didn’t know at the time that this clue had al­ ready been found by scientists who were well ahead of me in the play. . . . for many years they have been carrying out full- scale research into the p ractical applications of the mathematical concept contained in that the­ ory.” Cathie speculated: Th e only way to traverse the vast distances of space is to possess the means of manipulating, or altering, the very structure of space itself; altering the space-time geometric matrix, which to us provides the illusion of form and distance. . . . for distance is an illusion. Th e o nly thing keeping places apart in space is time. If it were possible to move from one position to an­ other in space in an infinitely small amount of time, or “zero time,” then both the positions would co- exist, according to our awareness. By speeding up the geometric of time we will be able to bring distant places within close proximity. Th is is the secret of UFOs—they travel by means of altering the spatial dimensions around them and reposi­ tioning in space-time. One hint that the U.S. government experimented with such technol­ ogy came in December 1980, when Betty Cash, Vickie Landrum, and Landrum’s seven-year-old grandson Colby encountered a large, glowing, diamond-shaped object hovering in the air near the small town of Huff ­ man, Texas. Th e trio, supported by other witnesses in the area, said the object was surrounded by military CH-47 helicopters. Days later, the trio experienced painful swellings and skin blisters, along with headaches, nausea, and hair loss, all symptoms of intense electromagnetic radiation. In 1985, the three victims sought $20 million in damages from the U.S. government, but the following year, their suit was dismissed, based on denials by the government that any such craft existed in its inventory. Yet another small public exposure to exotic energy manipulation may h ave come with the accidental discovery of single-atom (monatomic) ele­ ments in the 1970s by Phoenix-area cotton farmer David Hudson. His discovery was followed by several scientifi c papers exploring the mysteries"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"84 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH of the atomic structure, nucleus deformation, and electromagnetism. Hudson himself obtained eleven worldwide patents on his “Orbitally Re­ arranged Monatomic Elements (ORME).” Hudson found that the nuclei of such monatomic matter acted in an u nusual manner. Under certain circumstances, they began spinning and creating strangely deformed shapes. Oddly, as these nuclei spun, they be­ gan to come apart on their own. It was found, for example, that in the element rhodium 103, the nu­ cl eus became deformed in a ratio of two to one, which made it twice as long as it is wide, and entered a high- spin state. When all electrons are brought under the control of the nucleus of an atom, the nucleus attains a “highward,” or high-spin, state. When reaching a state of reciprocal rela­ tionship, the electrons turn to pure white light and the individual atoms fall apart, producing a white monatomic powder. Using thermo- gravimetric analysis, it was found that a sample of Hud- so n’s monatomic matter lost 44 percent of its original weight when re­ duced to this white-powder state. By being either heated or cooled, it would gain or lose weight. “By repeated annealing we could make the ma­ terial weigh less than the pan weighed it was sitting in,” said Hudson, “. . . or we could make it weigh 300–400 times what its beginning weight was, depending on whether we were heating or cooling it . . . . [I]f you take t his white powder and put it on a quartz boat and heat it up to the point where it fuses with the quartz, it becomes black and it regains all its weight again. Th is makes no sense, it’s impossible, it can’t happen. But there it is.” British author Laurence Gardner noted, “Hudson was then asked to r everse the pro cess fully by turning the powder back into a piece of metal­ lic gold. It was like asking someone to remake an apple from a pan of apple sauce—seemingly impossible! Early trial led to some disastrous results . . . . By late 1995, the diffi c ulties had been overcome and the figurative apple had indeed been rebuilt from the apple sauce. From this, there was no doubt that it was possible ( just as in ancient metallurgical lore) to manu­ facture gold from a seemingly non-gold base product. From a commenc­ ing sample which registered as iron, silica, and aluminum, emerged an ingot which analyzed as pure gold. Aft er centuries of trial, error, frustra­"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"NAZI WONDER WEAPONS 85 tion, and failure, the Philos opher’s Stone of ancient times had at last been rediscovered.” Gardner amassed a wealth of material linking the white powder of gold t o alchemists, the legendary Knights Templar, Solomon’s treasure, the manna of the Israelites, Moses, and ancient Egypt. Th e signifi cance of these connections will become apparent in the next section. By the early 1990s, scientifi c pa pers were being published by the Niels Bohr Institute and Argonne National and Oak Ridge National Laborato­ ries, substantiating the existence of these high-spin, monatomic elements and their power as superconductors. Hudson also met with Dr. Hal Puthoff , d irector of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Austin, Texas. Puthoff performs cutting- edge re­ search into zero-point energy and gravity as a zero-point fl uctuation force. He and other scientists have theorized that enough energy exists in the space found in the atoms inside an empty coff ee cup to boil all the oceans of the Earth if fully utilized. Puthoff ha d also theorized that matter reacting in two dimensions should lose about 44 percent of its gravitational weight, exactly the weight loss found by Hudson. When it was found that Hudson’s elements, when heated, could achieve a gravitational attraction of less than zero, Puthoff concluded the powder was “exotic matter” capable of bending time and space. Th e material’s antigravitational properties were confirmed when it was shown that a weighing pan weighed less when the powder was placed in it than it did empty. Th e matter had passed its antigravitational proper­ ties to the pan. Adding to their amazement, it was found that when the white powder w as heated to a certain degree, not only did its weight disappear but the powder itself vanished from sight. When a spatula was used to stir around in the pan, there apparently was nothing there. Yet, as the material cooled, it reappeared in its original confi guration. Th e material had not simply disappeared; it apparently had moved into another dimension. Hudson also saw evidence of perpetual energy through the use of a su­ p erconductor. “You literally start the superconductor fl owing by applying a magnetic fi eld,” he said. “It responds to this by fl owing light inside and"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"86 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH building a bigger Meissner Field [Walter Meissner in 1933 discovered that light fl owing within a superconductor produces an electromagnetic en­ ergy fi eld that excludes external magnetic fi elds] around it.

Th ere is absolutely no resistance; it is perpetual motion and will run forever.” Th is n ew technology dealt with the manipulation and control of basic energy. Some scientists believed that such control at the atomic and sub­ atomic level might do much more than off er new propulsion technolog y. It might open the door to antigravity, limitless free energy, a cure for dis­ eases such as AIDS and cancer, an end to the aging pro cess, faster-than-light speeds, and much more, perhaps even inter-dimensional and time travel. Since science is coming to the conclusion that gravity and time are inter­ c onnected aspects of energy, it is possible that the Bell was used for experi­ menting with time travel. Th is possibility is not as outrageous as it sounds, as many notable scientists and authors have written seriously about the possibility of time travel. Astronomer and Pulitzer Prize winner Carl Sagan, director of the L aboratory for Planetary Studies at Cornell University at the time of his death in 1996, when asked about time travel, stated: Right now we’re in one of those classic, wonderfully evocative mo­ ments in science when we don’t know, when there are those on both sides of the debate, and when what is at stake is very mystifying and very profound. If we could travel into the past, it’s mind-boggling what would be poss ible. For one thing, history would become an experimental sci­ ence, which it certainly isn’t today. Th e possible insights into our own past and nature and origins would be dazzling. For another, we would be facing the deep paradoxes of interfering with the scheme of causal­ ity that has led to our own time and ourselves. I have no idea whether it’s possible, but it’s certainly worth exploring. Jenny Randles, a science- oriented British author, presented compelling examples of recent discoveries in her 2005 book Breaking the Time Bar -"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"NAZI WONDER WEAPONS 87 rier, which indicate the very real possibility of time travel. She noted that “a race to build a time machine has been going on since at least the Second World War.” Aft er discussing “worm holes” in time and space, and other possible means of time travel, she pointed out, “. . . [F]rom our under­ standing of physics—if you travel faster than light, then you can overtake the fl ow of events that light happens to transmit. Since the passage of these events forms what we interpret as time, then by traveling faster than light you ought to travel through time. Spaceships that outstrip light speed are always going to moonlight as time machines.” Today, more than one scientist has claimed to have broken the light barrier, though offi cial ac ceptance has been lacking. T IME- TR AV E L ING N A ZIS . This horrendous idea sounds preposterous, but the science is there and the Bell did exist. No wonder certain powerful persons would go to any lengths to ob­ ta in or conceal such knowledge. Just such attempts began in the closing days of World War II, as the victors sought to learn the secrets of Nazi super- science. It is clear that certain members of the American military were keen to l earn Nazi secrets, as shown by this portion of a 1945 letter from Major General Hugh J. Knerr to Lieutenant General Carl Spaatz, the com­ mander of U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe: “Occupation of German scientifi c and industrial establishments has revealed the fact that we have been alarmingly backward in many fields of research. If we do not take this opportunity to seize the apparatus and the brains that developed it and put the combination back to work promptly, we will remain several years behind while we attempt to cover a field already exploited.” Consider the rush into Czecho slovaki a by General George S. Patton’s Th i rd Army even as the Europe an war wound to a close. “Th e madcap, and some would say, militarily and politically indefensible, Allied dash away from Berlin and to south-central Germany and Prague are consistent with A mer ica n k nowled ge , at some ver y h ig h le vel, of K a m m ler’s S S S onderkom­ mando black projects and secret weapons empire,” wrote Farrell. Vernon Bowen, whose 1950s-era book on UFOs was classifi ed b y the"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"88 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH U.S. government, relates how one of Patton’s offi ce rs, Colonel Charles H. Reed, organized the escape of the Lippizan horses from the Spanish Rid­ ing School at the end of the war, an event memorialized in the 1963 Dis­ ney film Miracle of the White Stallions. Bowen noted that Reed saved the horses “while on his mission of persuading the head of German intelli­ gence to turn over to the U.S. the many truckloads of documents buried on the Czech-Austrian border—documents which are still secret today.” Could these documents have been Kammler’s technology files? Th e A llies’ rejection of SS chief Himmler’s last-minute off er to surren­ der may not have been due to the “frantic attempts of a desperate mass murderer to avoid his inevitable fate,” as described by mainstream histori­ ans, but instead because Himmler had lost real control over the exotic technology. Aft er all, Himmler was too high-profile a person to be allowed to live on aft er the war. He reportedly committed suicide by taking a poi­ son capsule on May 23, 1945, aft er being caught trying to sneak through British lines disguised as a German Army private. Hans Kammler, on the other hand, was largely unknown to the public, t hough he undoubtedly was high on the list of wanted Nazi war crimi­ nals, considering his involvement in the construction of concentration camps and their gas chambers as well as his participation in the leveling of the Warsaw ghetto. “Unlike Himmler,” noted Cook, “Kammler had some­ thing of value to deal—something tangible. By early April [1945], Hitler and Himmler had placed under his direct control every secret weapon system of any consequence within the Th ird Reich—weapons that had no counterpart in the inventories of the three powers that were now bearing down on central Germany from the east and the west.” “Th e d eal had already probably been cut between Kammler’s repre­ sentatives and OSS [the U.S. Offi ce of Strategic Services] station chief in Zurich, Allen Dulles, or via General Patton himself,” Farrell surmised. If such a deal was made with Patton, he did not live to see the results. O n December 9, 1945, while riding in his 1939 Cadillac staff car, Patton suff ered a head injury when his car was struck by a 2 1 ⁄ 2 -ton military truck that turned in front of them. Patton’s driver and a passenger, his chief of staff Major General Hobart “Hap” Gay, were uninjured. Paralyzed from"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"NAZI WONDER WEAPONS 89 the neck down, Patton was taken to a military hospital in Heidelberg, Germany, where he died on December 21. Since the war, there have been several conspiracy theories regarding P atton’s death—one being that he was killed by his own government. Most have concentrated on his vocal assertions that the United States should have carried the war on into Rus sia and put an end to communism, plus his public advocacy of reinstating ranking Nazis to help rebuild Ger­ many. Noting that Patton, whose forces drove straight to the heart of Nazi r esearch in Czecho slovaki a, may well have been aware of Kammler and his Nazi superweapons, Farrell stated that if Patton was deliberately si­ lenced, “then surely this [knowledge of Nazi super-science] is the most plausible motivation for the deed.” Did knowledge of the incredible ability to manipulate energy die with t op Nazis at the end of the war? Consider the fate of Hans Kammler. As the war drew to a close, Kammler made no secret that he intended t o use both the V-2 scientists and rockets under his control as leverage for a deal with the Allies. On April 2, 1945, on Kammler’s orders, a special train carried rockets and fi ve hundred technicians and engineers escorted by a hundred SS troopers to an Alpine redoubt in Bavaria. According to von Braun and Dornberger, Kammler planned to “bargain with the Americans or one of the other Allies for his own life in exchange for the leading German rocket specialists.” “[Kammler] came to me in early April in order to say good-bye,” re­ ca lled Nazi armaments minister Speer. “For the first time in our four-year association, Kammler did not display his usual dash. On the contrary, he seemed insecure and slippery with his vague, obscure hints about why I should transfer to Munich with him. He said eff orts were being made in the SS to get rid of the fuehrer. He himself, however, was planning to con­ tact the Americans. In exchange for their guaranty of freedom, he would off er them the entire technology of our jet planes, as well as the A-4 rocket and other important developments . . . . ” On April 4, 1945, when von Braun pressed Kammler for permission to re sume rocket research, the SS offi cer quietly announced that he was about"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"90 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH to disappear for “an indefinite length of time.” He was true to his word: no one saw Kammler again. As everyone knows, von Braun and Dorn­ berger, along with other scientists and many of the V-2 rockets, eventually made their way to the United States, becoming founding members of its modern space program with no help from Kammler. Jean Michel, himself an inmate of concentration camp Dora, which p rovided slave labor for Kammler’s rocket program, wrote of Kammler: “Th e chief of the SS secret weapon empire, the man in Himmler’s confi ­ dence, disappeared without a trace. Even more disturbing is the fact that the architect of the concentration camps, builder of the gas chambers, ex­ ecutioner of Dora, overall chief of all the SS missiles has sunk into obliv­ ion. Th ere is the Bormann mystery, the Mengele enigma; as far as I know, no one, to this day, has taken much interest in the fate of SS Obergrup­ penfuehrer Hans Kammler.” Michel, along with others, wondered, “Why had the ‘cold and brutal calculator’ described by Speer so abruptly dis­ carded the trump cards he had so patiently accumulated?” As the war drew to a close, Kammler “had the good fortune to inspect t he Czecho slovaki an stretch of the front,” wrote Witkowski. “Aft er this event, nobody knew what became of him. Perhaps he died, though it is unlikely that this would never have been recorded.” Th e r eports of Kammler’s death are varied and mutually exclusive. One version has him committing suicide in a forest between Prague and Pilsen two days aft er Germany surrendered, while another said he was shot by his own SS aide in Prague. Another version was that he died in a shootout with Czech partisans. The Red Cross initially reported Kammler as “miss­ ing,” but this was later changed to “dead” upon the testimony of a relative. Th e one common denominator regarding Kammler’s various death re­ ports was that he was last seen in north central Czecho slovaki a, in close proximity to the Wenzeslaus Mine—and the Bell. Despite the lack of a body, no eff or t appeared to have been taken to es­ tablish the truth of Kammler’s death and, unlike his superior Bormann, Kammler was not tried in absentia at Nuremberg. Kammler was not alone in his escape. Dozens of high-ranking former S S or party members simply disappeared. Many of them were associated with advanced technology programs."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"NAZI WONDER WEAPONS 91 Did Kammler and his cohorts escape with weapons plans for the amaz­ ing Bell project? Whoever controlled such secret technology was certainly in a strong position to strike a deal with one of the Allied nations. With secret projects in the hands of the fanatical SS and with factories a nd research facilities scattered over—and under—the countryside, it is entirely conceivable that saucers, uranium weapons, the Bell, and other exotic technologies could have been developed without the knowledge of anyone except Himmler, Bormann, and Kammler. Th e high- profile Himmler had been taken out of the loop as far back as 1943. The fates of Bormann and Kammler remain unproven. “[T]he evidence is strong enough to suggest collusion at the highest levels between the United States and Nazi Germany governments—and that collusion extends down to those within U-234, its officers, crew and passengers—and has been main­ tained by powerful parties with vested interests on both sides of the At­ lantic ever since,” stated Hydrick. If the highest circle of America’s ruling elite indeed obtained Nazi su per-science in the wake of World War II, it came with a price—one these prewar, pro-Nazi sympathizers were willing to accept. When Amer­ ican authorities realized the alternative and nonlinear physics within Nazi science, they knew it was beyond the frame of reference of most U.S. sci­ entists, which is why they recruited so many Germans and brought them to America. “Th e tr ouble was,” recounted one government insider, “when the Amer­ icans took it all home with them, they found, too late, that it came in­ fected with a virus—you take the science on, you take on aspects of the ideolog y as well.” Th e intense interest of the Nazi leadership in occult or hidden subjects—from ancient artifacts to legends of prehistorical high-tech super-races—is well documented. Toward the end of the war, their acqui­ sition of super-science may have been matched by the recovery of an amaz­ ing and precious treasure."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"C 4 HAPTER A TREA SURE TROVE I N M ARCH 19 4 4 , T H E CR AGGY PE A K S SU R ROU N DI NG T H E ANCIENT Cathar fortress of Montségur in southern France reverberated with the grinding gears and revving engines of military machines.

During his time in school, Rahn had become fascinated with legends of the Holy Grail as well as the little-understood Cathars—“pure ones,” as they were called—who had opposed the Roman Church and thus suff ered near annihilation in a papal military campaign in 1209, known as the Albigensian Crusade. In the early 1930s, Rahn traveled widely in the Languedoc region of S outhern France, even spelunking among the maze of cave systems in the foothills of the Pyrenees mountains. Here he gained firsthand knowledge about the Cathars and their descendants, many of whom became mem - bers of the fabled Knights Templar. Rahn’s book Crusade Against the Grail w as published in 1933, the same year Hitler came to power.

Himmler and his cronies must have been entranced with Rahn, who ha d drawn connections between the Cathar fortress of Montségur and a fabulous cave housing the Holy Grail called Montsavat, mentioned in Parzival by Wolfram von Eschenbach in the thirteenth century. Rahn believed he had discovered the final resting place of a great treasure of an - tiquity, which included the Tables of Testimony, the Grail Cup known as E merald Cup, and perhaps even the long-lost Ark of the Covenant. And by March 1944, the Nazis were free to move troops into Langue - doc in search of this ancient wealth, known as King Solomon’s treasure. It was much too late for Rahn. By 1939, Rahn had become disenchanted wi th his Nazi superiors, writing, “Th ere is much sorrow in my country. [It is] impossible for a tolerant, liberal man like me to live in the nation that my native country has become.” He resigned his commission in the SS in February 1939 and, barely a month later, reportedly died of exposure aft er having been caught in a snowstorm during a hiking expedition. Rumors circulated that he had been killed in a concentration camp. Th e National Socialist ideologue Alfred Rosenberg recorded that Rahn committed sui - cide by taking cyanide “for politico-mystical reasons as well as for personal one s.” However he died, Rahn’s knowledge was retained by Himmler. T HE FA BLED TR EA SU R E of King Solomon is the greatest cache of riches known to humankind. Its fascinating history serves as a timeline for the evolution of Western civilization as it can be traced from ancient Mesopo - tamia up to World War II. Gold, silver, and precious gems—such as diamonds, pearls, emeralds, a mber, amethyst, topaz, sapphires, rubies, turquoise, and others— comprised this priceless hoard of riches. But Solomon’s treasure also con - tained riches of quite a diff e rent sort. It included ancient scrolls, texts, and tablets upon which was inscribed some of the world’s most esoteric and occult knowledge. Th is knowledge had been handed down for thou - sands of years from the time of the world’s first recorded civilization in a ncient Sumer—present- day Iraq."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"A TREASURE TROVE 95 Th ousands of translated Sumerian tablets along with their inscribed cylinder seals are now available and they tell of astonishing technology apparently in use prior to Noah’s fl ood. With recent scientifi c advancements—such as powered flight, the space program, DNA manip - ulation, and cloning—many experts are beginning to rethink the idea t hat today’s world is the apex of civilization’s evolution. It is now possible to consider that a technically advanced civilization was on the Earth in the far distant past, possessing knowledge that mankind is only just now relearning. Bits and pieces of ancient knowledge that survived the Great Flood fo rmed the essence of the riches that were transported to Egypt by Abra - ham, the inheritor of the secrets of Enoch and the biblical patriarch of bo th Arabs and the Jews. Abraham, a native of Sumer, known early on as Abram, by some traditions was said to possess a tablet of symbols repre - senting all of the knowledge of humankind handed down from the time o f Noah. Known to the Sumerians as the Table of Destiny, it was this ta - ble of knowledge—known to the early Jews as the Book of Raziel—that r eportedly provided King Solomon with his vast wisdom. Th e S umerian Table of Destiny is thought to be the same as the Tables of Testimony mentioned in Exodus 31:18. Other Bible verses—Exodus 24:12 and 25:16—make it clear that these tables are not the Ten Com - mandments. British author Laurence Gardner believed this ancient archive was di - rectly associated with the Emerald Table of Th o th-Hermes, and that its author was the biblical Ham. “He was the essential founder of the esoteric and arcane ‘underground stream’ which fl owed through the ages,” stated Gardner. Th is table of knowledge was passed from Egypt and Mesopota - mia to Greek and Roman masters, such as Homer, Virgil, Pythagoras, P lato, and Ovid. In more recent times, it was passed through such secret societies as the Rosicrucians and Knights Templar and on to the Stuart Royal Society in En gland. In Jewish history, the Cabala, also spelled as Kabbalah or Qabbalah, w as supposed to contain hidden meanings. Such cleverly coded knowledge was thought to be found within the Torah and other old Hebraic texts, such as the Sefer Yezirah (Book of Creation) and the Sefer Ha-Zohar"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"96 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH (Book of Light). Th ese books, which predate the Talmud, a compilation of early Jewish laws and traditions fi rst written in the fift h century A.D. , were produced centuries before the time of Jesus. According to the Book of Light, “mysteries of wisdom” were given to Adam by God while still in the fabled Garden of Eden, generally believed to have been located between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. These elder secrets were then passed on through Adam’s sons to Noah and on to Abraham long before the He - brews existed as a distinct people. Much like our understanding of history and religion today, the infor - mation within the Cabala became both incomplete and garbled over the ce nturies through losses due to war and natural disasters as well as misin - terpretations and foreign infl u ences. But it was this ancient wisdom, taken from Egypt at the time of the Great Exodus, that formed the core of Cabalistic knowledge handed down through the centuries via several se - cret societies, some of which remain active among us even today. But what of Solomon’s treasure itself? What happened to the wealth—in bo th riches and knowledge—that found a resting place on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem with the construction of Solomon’s Temple nearly a one thousand years before the birth of Jesus? Much of this treasure fell into the hands of the Romans when they sa cked Jerusalem following the Jewish Revolt of 66 A.D. By the time of this looting, Solomon’s Temple had been built over to become the palace of King Herod. With the certain advance intelligence that the Romans would be sending troops to put down the Jewish rebellion, keepers of the knowl - edge buried away much of the treasure in the catacombs beneath Herod’s pa lace. Alcoves and passages were closed off and sealed with earth. Th us , when the Romans sacked Jerusalem following revolts in both 66 A.D. and 132 A.D. , they found only a portion of the treasure. To have hidden all the treasure would have prompted a strenuous search by the Roman authorities. As it was, they were content to move what they found to Rome as war booty. Th e best part of the treasure, including both wealth and knowledge, was safely buried under the Temple Mount and all but for - gotten, as most religious leaders were killed or taken to Rome as prisoners.

It was the first successful attack on Rome in more than eight hundred years. Alaric’s troops took the portion of Solomon’s treasure in Rome along w ith other prizes of war. “When Alaric withdrew his forces, the treasures of Solomon’s Temple went with them,” wrote Colonel Howard Buechner, a former medical offi cer with the 45th Infantry Division. Th is c ontention was supported by the work of Otto Rahn, who wrote in 1933 of four young men who discovered a casket in a Pyrenees cavern, “Was this reliquary casket part of ‘Solomon’s treasure,’ which was taken by the Visigoth king Alaric from Rome to Carcassonne in A.D. 410? Accord- ing to [the last major ancient Greek philos opher, Proclus], it was filled with o bjects that once belonged to King Solomon, the king of the Hebrews.” Th e V isigoths secured their booty in the Pyrenees foothills located in the Languedoc region of what was to become southern France. Th is area encompasses the Cathar stronghold at Montségur as well as the small vil - lage of Rennes- le- Château. Th e secrets of this treasure were handed from the Goths and the early Franks to the Cathars, the “pure ones” of south - ern France. Th e y considered their Christian beliefs more pure than those of the Church of Rome, probably because they had access to original documents and were not dependent on the Church hierarchy to translate and interpret the Bible. In fact, according to Otto Rahn, Cathar beliefs were greatly infl uenced by Druids, priests, and soothsayers who had spread from Mesopotamia through eastern and western Europe to the British Isles. Catharism was an odd blending of ancient Earth worship, Eastern mysticism, Gnosis, and basic Christianity. Th e Ca thar faith, sometimes described as “Western Buddhism,” might have spread to all the corners of Europe but for the blood and fire of the Albigensian Crusade begun in 1209, which may well have been more of a French civil war than a religious campaign. It was fought between the tightly controlled and austere northerners and the cultured, freedom- loving peoples of the south. Rahn noted the exotic ethnic mixture of the Languedoc region. “In the t hird century B.C. , an immigration of peoples from the Caucasus to the West took place: Phoenicians, Persians, Medeans, Getules (actually Berbers"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"98 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH of North Africa), Armenians, Chaldeans [Sumerians], and Iberians,” he wrote. Prior to the Vatican-approved bloodletting, the provinces of south - ern France were virtually indepen dent republics that allowed extraordi - nary freedom of education, culture, and diversity. Jews were accorded the sa me rights as the rest of the citizenry. Both agriculture and the arts were flourishing. Many of the Cathars, while Christians, nevertheless still wor - shipped the feminine goddesses—Isis and Athena—as had their Gothic an d Frankish ancestors. It is not known but strongly suspected by researchers that this hidden tr easure guarded by the Cathars included a copper scroll similar to an etched scroll of copper found among the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947 at Qumran, on the northwest shore of the Dead Sea. When translated in the mid-1950s at Manchester University, this scroll proved to be an inventory of a great treasure. It apparently was one of several copies. With its de - tailed directions to hidden Hebrew valuables, the Copper Scroll was liter - ally a treasure map. Such an inventory in the hidden Visigoth cache would ex plain why certain French aristocrats, descendants of the Goths and the Cathars, who had access to the treasure, fomented the First Crusade, re - sulting in the capture of Jerusalem in 1099 A.D. Less than twenty years aft er the crusaders took Jerusalem and placed King Baldwin II of Le Bourg in charge of the occupied territories, nine knights were granted a military order called the Poor Knights of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon. Th is title was soon shortened to the Knights of the Temple, or Knights Templar. Th ey were allowed to be billeted in Herod’s palace, the exact location of the hidden treasure as described in the Copper Scroll. Th ese k nights were led by Hugh de Payens, a nobleman in the service of his cousin, Hughes, count of Champagne, and Andre de Montbard, the uncle of Bernard of Clairvaux, later known as the Cistercian Saint Ber - nard. Montbard also was a vassal of the count of Champagne. At least two o f the original knights, Rosal and Gondemare, were Cistercian monks prior to their departure for Jerusalem. In fact, the entire group was closely related both by family ties and by connections to the Cistercian monks and Flemish royalty descended from the Cathars. Th ey journeyed to the Holy Land with an agenda: to recover the remainder of the treasure."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"A TREASURE TROVE 99 Ostensibly, this order of knights was to protect the roads to Jerusalem, but their actions were of a very diff erent nature. Rather than guard roads, the Templar knights spent years excavating under Herod’s palace, the old Temple of Solomon. Th e digging was extensive. British Royal Engineers led by a Lieutenant Charles Wilson discovered evidence of the Templars while mapping vaults under Mount Moriah in 1894. Th ey found vaulted passageways with keystone arches, typical of Templar handiwork. Th ey also found artifacts consisting of a spur, parts of a sword and lance, and a small Templar cross, which are still on display in Scotland. It was during their excavations, according to several accounts, that the T emplars acquired material wealth as well as texts of hidden knowledge, most probably including some dealing with the life of Jesus and his asso - ciations with the Essenes and Gnostics. Th ey a lso reportedly acquired the legendary Tables of Testimony given to Moses as well as other holy relics— perhaps even the legendary Ark of the Covenant and the Spear of Longinus—which could have been used to validate their later position as an alternative religious authority to the Roman Church. When the Knights Templar transported the remainder of Solomon’s tr easure back to the Languedoc region of southern France, it was reunited with the portion the Goths had brought from Rome more than seven hun - dred years earlier. Th e mate rial wealth—King Solomon’s diamonds, pre - cious gems, gold, and silver—formed the base of the Templars’ legendary f ortune. Much of this was transported to their temple in Paris. Th e esoteric treasure—scrolls and tablets of ancient knowledge—were kept hidden from the Roman Church in the elaborate cave systems of the Pyrenees. On Friday, October 13, 1307, the greedy French king Philip, in debt t o the Templars, moved against the Templars with the blessing of Pope Clement V. Like their Cathar forebears, the Templars were charged with all forms of heresy. Templars throughout Europe were hunted down, killed, and tortured. Th e last Templar grand master, Jacques de Molay, was burned at the stake in 1314. But many Templars simply cast off their distinctive surcoats, identifiable by the red Maltese cross, and blended into the local populations only to emerge in later years as Freemasons. When authorities broke into the Paris temple, they found nothing.

Some went to Scotland, where Robert the Bruce provided the Templars sanctuary, some went to pre-Columbus America, and some returned to the caverns of Languedoc. Centuries passed while the devout in southern France kept the secret of t he hidden treasure from both church and state authorities. Th is secret briefl y broke into public view in the late 1890s, when the young priest of the small village of Rennes-le-Château discovered some documents hidden in the alter of his church, which had been consecrated to Mary Magdalene in 1059 and stood on Visigoth ruins dating to the sixth century. In 1891, Father Francois Berenger Sauniere discovered two genealogies d ating from 1244 and 1644, along with two texts written in the 1780s by a former parish priest, Abbot Antoine Bigou. Th e Bigou texts were unu - sual and appeared to be written in diff e rent and indecipherable codes. Sauniere took his discovery to his superior, the bishop of nearby Carcas - sonne, who sent him on to Paris to meet with the director general of t he Saint-Sulpice Seminary, reportedly a center for an unorthodox society called the Compagnie du Saint-Sacrement, reputed to be a front for the Priory of Sion. Th is priory is thought to include members committed to keeping secret the Templar treasure and knowledge. Whatever was in the documents changed Sauniere’s life. He journeyed t o Paris, where he mingled with the Parisian cultural elite and soon came into great wealth. Before his sudden death in 1917, researchers estimated he had spent several million dollars on construction and renovations in the town. He also had the town’s road and water supply upgraded, assem - bled a massive library, and built a zoological garden, a lavish country house na med Villa Bethania, and a round tower named Tour Magdala, or Tower of Magdalene. Within the renovated church, Sauniere erected a strange statue of the demon Asmodeus—“custodian of secrets, guardian of hid- den treasures, and, according to ancient Judaic legend, builder of Solo- mon ’s temple.” Sauniere began to exhibit a defi a nt independence toward his Church superiors, refusing to disclose the source of his newfound wealth or accept a transfer from Rennes-le-Château, where he and his house keeper were seen digging incessantly in the graveyard around the church. Yet, when"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"A TREASURE TROVE 101 push came to shove, the Vatican supported Sauniere, a good indication of the signifi cance of his discoveries. On January 17, 1917, Sauniere suff e red a sudden stroke. A nearby priest was called to administer last rites but, “visibly shaken,” refused to do so aft er hearing Sauniere’s confession, which has never been made public. His house keeper and companion, Marie Denarnaud, kept her silence about Sauniere’s activities, living quietly in the Villa Bethania. Toward the end of her life, she sold the villa to a man whom she promised she would tell a secret that would make him both wealthy and powerful. Un - fortunately, she too died of a stroke before passing along this secret. Th us beg an the mystery of Rennes-le- Château. “Speculation has varied over the years as to the true nature of Sauniere’s discovery,” wrote Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince; “most prosaically it has been suggested that he found a hoard of treasure, while others believe it was something consider - ably more stupendous, such as the Ark of the Covenant, the treasure of t he Jerusalem Temple, the Holy Grail—or even the tomb of Christ . . . . The Priory claim that what Sauniere had discovered were parchments c ontaining genealogical information that proves the survival of the [Franks] Merovingian dynasty.” Whatever Sauniere found, it seems to have been linked to Solomon’s treasure long hidden in the nearby cave systems by first the Goths and later the Templars. In review of what is known about the Father Sauniere aff a ir, it appears doubtful that the priest actually found the lost treasure. It is more likely that his fi nd was some ancient genealogies inimical to the Catholic Church and perhaps some clues to the location of the treasure. Such clues were expanded upon by the work of Otto Rahn with further expeditions to Languedoc financed by SS chief Himmler. Rahn’s work was getting him closer to the location of the treasure. “In a letter written to [Rahn’s close friend Karl Maria Wiligut-Weisthor] in September 1935, Otto Rahn in - formed his friend that he was at a place where he had reason to believe the G rail might be found, and that Weisthor should keep the matter secret with the exception of mentioning it to Himmler,” reported British authors David Wood and Ian Campbell. By the start of the war, Rahn was dead but his knowledge was kept"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"102 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH alive by Himmler. According to author Angebert, as early as June 1943, a group of German geologists, historians, and ethnologists camped near Montségur and began excavations that lasted into November. Th is expe - dition failed to produce the treasure. B UT O TTO S KOR Z E N Y, dispatched by Himmler in early 1944, appar - ently had better luck. “The commando force reached Languedoc in early Ma rch 1944, and set up headquarters at the base of Montségur. Th ey spent a few days exploring the Cathar fortress and in reconnaissance of the surrounding mountains. Th ey discovered remnants of what had once been a 3,000-step stairway which led from the castle to an exit in the val - ley below,” wrote Colonel Howard Buechner. Skorzeny, disdaining intellectual study of the problem over the trea- su re’s location, set about his work from the standpoint of a tactician. He quickly surmised that Rahn and the members of the 1943 expedition had looked in the obvious—and wrong—locations. Th e G ermans promptly found a secret path used as an escape route for the Cathars during the siege of Montségur, which ended in March 1244, exactly seven hundred years earlier. “Skorzeny and his men scouted along this path and soon discovered what appeared to be an ancient trail leading into the higher mountains,” related Colonel Buechner. “At an undisclosed distance from Montségur they found a fortified entrance to a large grotto. Perhaps it was the grotto of Bouan, which was the last refuge of the Ca - thars aft e r the fall of Montségur. Not far from this grotto was the moun - tain called La Peyre. Near the crest of this mountain was another grotto a nd in this cavern, it is said, they found the treasure.” On March 15, 1944, Skorzeny sent a one-word telegram to Berlin. It r ead: “ Ureka [Eureka, or I have found it!].” It was signed with Skorzeny’s nickname, “Scar.” His message was soon answered with a cryptic note: “Well done. Con - gratulations.

In 1944, the local German military governor refused to grant permission, claiming Hitler’s Th ird Reich had “historic rights” to Montségur. In defi ance of this prohibition, a group of pilgrims traveled to Montségur anyway and there encountered Skorzeny and his men. Th e giant commander chief, who had a reputation for defying bu - reaucracy, granted their request, since he had control of the treasure. Th e p ilgrims placed special signifi cance on the date March 16, 1944, because of an ancient prophecy that stated, “At the end of seven hundred years, the laurel will be green once more.” Many assumed this meant the beginning of a revival of Catharism. Th at year’s seven hundredth anniver - sary delegation of pilgrims was much larger than usual. “Th us i t was that the worshippers were on top of the mountain [Montségur] at precisely the time when Skorzeny had been instructed to ‘watch the sky,’ ” noted Colo - nel Buechner. Near noon, a Fieseler Storch, or Stork, light airplane bear - ing German markings approached and created a giant spectacle for the ga thered crowd. Th e airplane, which may have carried either Himmler, Nazi ideologist Alfred Rosenberg, or both, used skywriting equipment to produce a huge Celtic cross across the sky over Montségur. “Th e p ilgrims on the mountaintop were awestruck and reacted as if a miracle had occurred,” said Colonel Buechner. “Th ey had no idea that the fabulous treasure of the Cathars had been discovered only a short time before and that the plane was saluting the victorious expedition.” Th e n ext aft ernoon, an offi cial delegation arrived and congratulations and medals were handed out. Th is delegation was headed by Rosenberg and Oberst, or colonel, Wolfram Sievers, a ranking member of the Ahnenerbe SS, the organization dealing with esoteric and occult matters for Himmler’s Black Shirts. According to Colonel Buechner’s sources, the treasure was car - ried out of the Pyrenees by pack-mule train to the village of Lavelanet, wh ere it was loaded onto trucks for the journey to a rail head. Guarded rail cars carried the treasure to the small town of Merkers, located about forty miles from Berlin, where it was catalogued by hand-picked members of the Ahnenerbe SS and then moved to other locations, including Hitler’s re - doubt at Berchtesgaden, where some of the treasure was carried into the ex - tensive tunnel system, large parts of which remain inaccessible today."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"104 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH “During its initial days at Merkers, the ‘Treasure of the Ages’ was in - tact for the last time,” stated Colonel Buechner. Th e N azis apparently had secured the world’s greatest treasure trove—both of wealth and of lost se - crets. According to Colonel Buechner, the treasure consisted of: ◆ Th ousands of gold coins, some of which dated back to the early days of the Roman Empire and earlier. ◆ Items believed to have come from the Temple of Solomon, which included gold plates and fragments of wood that provided strong evidence that the partially decomposed relic was the fabled Ark of the Covenant. ◆ Twelve stone tablets bearing pre-runic inscriptions, which none of the experts were able to read. Th ese items comprised the stone grail of the Germans and of Otto Rahn. ◆ A beautiful silvery cup with an emerald-like base made of what appeared to be jasper.

However, there were many crosses from diff erent periods, made of gold or silver and adorned with pearls and precious stones. ◆ An abundance of precious stones in all sizes and shapes. By the time the Allies occupied Germany, much of the treasure had bee n melted down into bars and shipped out of the country. A vast amount of gold and silver, as well as pieces of art and religious artifacts, were taken into Allied hands in the town of Merkers, but the most rare and valuable items dropped from public view. “When Martin Bormann’s wife—Frau Gerda Buch Bormann—was ca ptured at a small hotel in northern Italy, she had 2,200 antique gold coins in her possession,” wrote Buechner. “Th ese priceless coins were al - most certainly a part of Hitler’s personal share of the Treasure of Solo - mon . . . .

Lest anyone consider Colo nel Buechner’s account of Otto Rahn and t he taking of Solomon’s treasure some personal fantasy, they would do well to consider his credentials. A native of New Orleans, Howard A. Buechner earned a bachelor’s degree from Tulane University and a medi - cal degree from Louisiana State University. During World War II, Dr. Bu echner was a medical offi cer with the 3rd Battalion, 157th Infantry Regiment of the 45th Infantry Division, the unit that arrived first at Dachau concentration camp. Dr. Buechner was the first American physi - cian to enter the camp upon its liberation. He was later promoted to colo - nel while serving in the postwar reserves. It was during his wartime ex periences, on the scene, that Colonel Buechner first learned of the loss of Solomon’s treasure. Buechner’s awards included the Medical Combat Badge, the Bronze Star, three battle stars, the Army Commendation Medal, the War Cross, and the Distinguished Service Cross of Louisiana. He also became a professor of medicine at Tulane and served as emeritus professor of medicine at LSU, where an honorary professorship was estab - lished in his name. His papers on tuberculosis and other lung diseases ma de him an internationally recognized expert. Colonel Buechner and other researchers have estimated the treasure t rove recovered by Skorzeny in southern France in excess of $60 billion, based on the current price of gold. Th is, added to the other loot from Eu - rope, gave the Nazis more than enough economic clout to continue their p lans for world conquest long aft er the end of World War II. Such wealth made it possible for Bormann and other Nazis to misdirect West German investigations and silence foreign governments and news organizations. And it provided the means to infiltrate and buy out numerous companies and corporations, both outside the United States and within.

Top Nazis began to draw up plans for escape and the continuation of their goals. Curt Reiss, a noted news correspondent of the time, who traveled ex - tensively in Europe, wrote in detail about the Nazis’ plans for survival, in h is book Th e Nazis Go Underground . Astonishingly, this was published in the spring of 1944, prior to the Allied D-Day landings in France that June. Reiss wrote, “Th ey had better means for preparing to go under - ground than any other potential underground movement in the entire p revious history of the world. Th ey had all the machinery of the well- organized Nazi state. And they had a great deal of time to prepare every - thing. Th e y worked very hard, but they did nothing hastily, left nothing to chance. Everything was thought through logically and organized to the last detail. Himmler [along with Bormann] planned with the utmost coolness. He chose for the work only the best-qualified experts—the best qualifi ed, that is, in matters of underground work.” Reiss pointed out that when the Nazi Party gained control in Germany, t he apparatus of the party was simply transferred over to the apparatus of the state. “Now, when the party wished to go underground and still retain its organization, all it had to do was simply to act in reverse order; that is, to transfer—or, more accurately perhaps, retransfer—the apparatus of the state into the party apparatus—a not-too-difficult enterprise, since both apparatuses were still organized along parallel lines,” he explained. According to Reiss, some misgivings about the fate of Germany arose e ven before the defeat of the Sixth Army at Stalin grad. He reported on a private meeting on November 7, 1942, in Munich, between SS chief Hein - rich Himmler and Hitler’s top lieutenant Martin Bormann. Th is meeting occurred only two days aft er Allied armies had landed in North Africa. Himmler later confi ded the topic of discussion, telling his most trusted associates, “It is possible that Germany will be defeated on the military front.

Krupp [von B ohlen und Halbach] and [I. G.

He said that Goering as well as other infl uential party men saw eye to eye with him on this, and would consent to any arrangement that did not involve the prestige of the party.” Reiss explained why these captains of industry faked a divorce from N azism rather than mounting genuine opposition—because they had prospered under Hitler. He had “liberated” them from the threat of worker unions and strikes, kept taxes much lower than other industrial - ized nations, and brought them unprecedented profi ts t hrough his re - armament program. “But all these are only symptoms,” wrote Reiss. “More i mportant than these symptoms is the fact that the Nazis as a dynamic movement had assured German big businessmen of basic conditions far more favorable than those they enjoyed under the republic or even under the Kaiser. Could they wish for anything better than a world constantly on the brink of new wars?” As noted previously, it was not only German businessmen who profi te d from the war. Th eir counterparts in En gland and America were all capi - talizing on the worldwide conflict. Reiss pointed out that only days aft er t he meeting of industrialists, Farben’s von Schnitzler flew to Madrid and declared he had escaped Germany just ahead of the Gestapo. “Spain scarcely seemed a logical asylum. Switzerland or Sweden would ha ve been much healthier places to repair to,” noted Reiss. “And anyway, why should Herr von Schnitzler have had to fear the Gestapo, since his son-in-law, Herbert Scholz, was one of its leading offi cials? No, there is no reason to believe a word of what Baron Schnitzler said in those first inter - views.” Reiss said Schnitzler’s “flight” was nothing but an elaborate ruse, s imilar to that of Germany’s steel magnate Fritz Th yssen, who moved to"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"THE WRITING ON THE WALL 109 France in 1940, reportedly to escape the Nazis, but ended the war in Ger- many’s prestigious hotel Adion, where he remained in contact with his old friend, banker Kurt Freiherr von Schroeder. By the end of 1943, another ranking Nazi had left th e Fatherland. Reichsbank president Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht had left the Fa - therland for Switzerland, ostensibly for health reasons. During his stay, acc ounts of his “Schlacht Plan” began to circulate. It was similar to that of Schnitzler—a collaboration between German and Allied corporate busi- ness with the major German banks acting as clearinghouses for such tr ansactions. Naturally, Schacht was to direct this eff ort. Despite his ac - tivities as one of the Reich’s principal money men, Schacht suff er ed no real penalties aft er the war. He was acquitted by the Nuremberg war crimes court, which stated that rearmament was not itself a criminal act. He was convicted in a German court and sentenced to eight years in prison, but this was overturned on appeal. Four more efforts to convict Schacht in court came to no avail. By late August 1944, following the D-Day invasion of Europe and de - spite the advent of the V-1 wonder weapon, many in the Nazi leadership w ere beginning to see the writing on the wall. When the French town of Saint-Lô, center of the German defense line facing the Allied beachhead in Normandy, fell on July 18, opening all of southern France to Allied armor and infantry, they knew the end of the war was only a matter of time. According to captured medical records, Hitler was on a roller- coaster r ide of euphoria and depression due to large daily doses of amphetamines, and had increasingly lost contact with reality. However, the second most powerful man in the Reich, Hitler’s deputy Martin Bormann, was not so incapacitated. Bormann, a stocky, nondescript man with thinning brown hair, was bo rn in 1900 in Halberstadt in central Germany. He was the son of a cav - alry sergeant who later became a civil servant. Young Bormann d ropp ed out of high school aft er one year and was later draft ed into the army dur - ing World War I, where he served with the fi el d artillery. Returning from the war, Bormann joined the right-wing Freikorps and served a year in prison in 1924 for his part in the murder of his former elementary school"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"110 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH teacher, who had been accused of betraying a Nazi leader when the Ruhr was under French occupation. Following his release from a Leipzig prison, Bormann joined the Nazi Party and rose steadily through the ranks. Shortly aft e r Hitler became German chancellor in 1933, Bormann was appointed chief of staff to Deputy Fuehrer Rudolf Hess. Aft er Hess’s ill- fated fl ight to Scotland in 1941, Bormann assumed his duties as well as becoming secretary to Hitler. Nazi leaders dubbed Bormann the “brown eminence” and “the Machiavelli behind the offi ce desk,” as he soon be - came the most powerful man in Nazi Germany. No one got to Hitler but thr ough Bormann. In 1943, Bormann gained total control over both the Nazi Party and t he German economy, including all top-secret technology. Already named to replace Hess as head of the Nazi Party, Bormann wrested economic and political control from Himmler by having Hitler prohibit the SS chief from issuing orders to the Gauleiters, or district leaders, through his SS commanders. According to Heinrich Hoff man, Hitler’s personal photog - rapher and the man who introduced him to his mistress Eva Braun, Hitler o nce said of Bormann, “I know he is brutal, but what he undertakes he finishes. I can rely absolutely on that. With his ruthlessness and brutality he always sees that my orders are carried out.” Bormann reigned supreme. On August 10, 1944, Bormann called top German business leaders a nd Nazi Party offi cials to the Hotel Maison Rouge in Strasbourg. Ac - cording to captured transcripts of the meeting, its purpose was to see t hat “the economy of the Th ird Reich was projected onto a postwar profi t-seeking track.” Th is “track ” came to be known as Aktion Adlerflug, or Operation Eagle Flight. It was nothing less than the perpetuation of National Socialism through the massive flight of money, gold, stocks, bonds, patents, copyrights, and even technical specialists from Germany. An emissary for Bormann, SS Obergruppenfuehrer Dr. Scheid, a direc - tor of the industrial firm of Hermadorff & Sch enburg Company, ex - plained the purpose of the meeting to one attendee: “German industry m ust realize that the war cannot now be won, and must take steps to pre - pare for a postwar commercial campaign which will in time ensure the ec onomic resurgence of Germany.” Scheid told attendees, “[A]ft e r the defeat of Germany, the Nazi Party"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"THE WRITING ON THE WALL 111 recognizes that certain of its best-known leaders will be condemned as war criminals. However, in cooperation with the industrialists, it is ar - ranging to place its less conspicuous but most important members with v arious German factories as technical experts or members of its research and designing offices.” As part of this plan, Bormann, aided by the black-clad SS, the central Deutsche Bank, the steel empire of Fritz Th ys- sen, and the powerful I. G. Farben combine, created 750 foreign front c orporations—58 in Portugal, 112 in Spain, 233 in Sweden, 214 in Swit - zerland, 35 in Turkey, and 98 in Argentina. According to Paul Manning, a CBS Radio journalist during World W ar II and the author of Martin Bormann: Nazi in Exile, Bormann “dwelled” on control of the 750 corporations. He wrote: “[Bormann] uti - lized every known device to disguise their ownership and their patterns of o perations: use of nominees, option agreements, pool agreements, en - dorsements in blank, escrow deposits, pledges, collateral loans, rights of fi rst refusal, management contracts, service contracts, patent agreements, cartels, and withholding procedures.” Copies of all transactions and even field reports were maintained and later shipped to Bormann’s archives in South America. Bormann followed strategies perfected by I. G. Farben chairman Her - mann Schmitz. Th e na mes of various companies and corporations would be changed and interchanged to create confusion as to ownership. For example, I. G. Chemie became Societe Internationale pour Participations Industrielles et Commerciales SA, while in Switzerland, the same organi - zation was known as International Industrie und Handelsbeteiligungen A G, or Interhandel. Another tactic was to name a compliant citizen from each country as t he nominal head of a given corporation. Meanwhile, the directors would be a blend of German administrators and bank offi cials. Offi cers at senior and management levels would be German scientists and technicians. Th e real ownership of the corporation would be Nazis holding bearer bonds as proof of stock ownership. Th ese individuals, all part of the Bormann op - eration, would remain in the shadows. The ta rgeted nations generally were appreciative of Bormann’s scheme, as it meant increased employment and a more favorable balance of trade."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"112 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH In 1941, 171 American corporations had more than $420 million in - vested in German companies. Aft e r war was declared, Bormann merely had operatives in neutral countries such as Switzerland and Argentina buy American stocks using foreign exchange funds in the Buenos Aires branch of Deutsche Bank and Swiss banks. Large demand deposits were also placed with major banks in New York City to include National City Bank (now Citibank), Chase (now JP Morgan Chase), Manufacturers and Hano - ver (now part of JP Morgan Chase), Morgan Guaranty, and Irving Trust ( now part of the Bank of New York). At the Strasbourg meeting, Scheid cited several prominent American c ompanies that had been useful to Germany in the past. Due to patent obligations, United States Steel, American Steel and Wire, and National Tube had to work in conjunction with the Krupp empire. He also men - tioned Zeiss Company, the Leica Company, and the Hamburg-Amerika l ine as firms that were especially effective in protecting Nazi interests. Bormann’s complex, yet well organized, flight capital operation con - founded Orvis A. Schmidt, the U.S. Treasury Department’s director of fo reign funds control. In 1945, Schmidt stated, “Th e network of trade, industrial, and cartel organizations has been streamlined and intermeshed, not only organizationally but also by what has offi cially been described as ‘personnel union.’ Legal authority to operate this organizational machin - ery has been vested in the concerns that have majority capacity in the key i ndustries, such as those producing iron and steel, coal and basic chemi - cals. Th e se concerns have been deliberately welded together by exchanges of stock to the point where a handful of men can make policy and other decisions that aff ect us all.” A T T H E H E A RT of this fl ight capital program lay the huge I. G. Farben conglomerate. Th e Farben complex already had produced many scientifi c breakthroughs for the Third Reich. “Its experts developed the noted Buna Pro cess for the manufacture of synthetic rubber, freeing Germany from dependence on natural rubber,” explained Paul Manning. “It developed the hydrogenation pro cess for making motor fuels and lubricating oils from coal. Germany’s shortage of bauxite, the raw material essential to"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"THE WRITING ON THE WALL 113 manufacture aluminum, was surmounted by its developments in utilizing the element magnesium.” Schmidt said Treasury investigations discovered Farben documents t hat showed the firm maintained an interest in more than 700 companies around the world. Th is number did not include Farben’s normal corpo - rate structure, which covered ninety-three countries, nor the 750 corpora - tions created under Bormann’s flight capital program. I. G. Farben also was at the hub of money transfers out of Nazi Ger - many. Even before the end of the war, for example, “I. G. Latin American fi rms all maintained, unrecorded, in their books, secret cash accounts in banks in the names of their top offi cials,” wrote Manning. “Th ese were used to receive and to disburse confi dential payments; firms dealing with Farben wanted this business but certainly did not wish it known to Brit - ish and United States economic authorities.” “Th e g reat German combines were the spearheads of economic pene - tration in the other American republics [South and Central American nati ons],” stated U.S. Treasury offi cial Schmidt. “In the fi eld of drugs and pharmaceuticals the Bayer, Merck, and Schering companies enjoyed a vir - tual monopoly. I. G. Farben subsidiaries had a firm hold on the dye and ch emical market. German enterprises such as Tubos Mannesmann, Fer - rostaal, AEG, and Siemens-Schuckert played a dominant role in the con - struction, electrical, and engineering fields. Shipping companies and, in s ome areas, German airlines, were well entrenched.” Th e foundation for a multinational German business empire was in place. A S I N T H E 1930s, the largest banking enterprises provided the underlying financial foundation for the resurgence of National Socialism. Th e cha irman of Deutsche Bank, Dr. Hermann Josef Abs, was particu - larly important to the Nazi flight capital program. Abs was also a director o f I. G. Farben, Daimler-Benz, and Siemens. Martin Bormann main- tained a cordial relationship with the Berlin banker. Manning noted: “ [Bormann] knew in 1943 . . . he had the means to ultimately take the reins of finance unto himself . . . . He could set a new Nazi state policy, wh en the time was ripe for the general transfer of capital, gold, stocks, and"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"114 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH bearer bonds to safety in neutral countries.” Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, and Commerzbank constituted the three major German banks, but it was Abs’s Deutsche Bank that took the lead in establishing eco - nomic authority over the banks and corporations of the occupied coun - tries. During the war, Deutsche Bank coordinated Nazi gold transactions, p urchasing 4,446 kilograms of gold from the Reichsbank and selling it in Turkey. Much of this gold came from victims of Nazi persecution. It ar - rived at the Reichsbank in crates and suitcases, sometimes marked with t heir place of origin, such as Auschwitz or Lublin. Th is wealth was greatly expanded by the loot of occupied Europe. According to author Ladislas Farago, this included “millions in gold marks, pound sterling, dollars, and Swiss francs, 3,500 ounces of platinum, over 550,000 ounces of gold, and 4,639 carats in diamonds and other precious stones, as well as hundreds of pieces of works of art.” According to Th e Guinness B ook of World Records, the “greatest un - solved bank robbery” in world history was the disappearance of the entire G erman treasury at the end of the war. But was it truly unsolved or merely covered up at the highest levels? Both Abs and Schmitz taught Bormann how to protect his wealth by d epositing it in Swiss banks. Bormann saw to it that while the Reich al - lowed occupied countries to continue printing their own currency, the ma jor commercial banks of Germany dealt in gold. Manning wrote, “Th e gold, whatever its origin, would be stamped with Th ird Reich seals and periodically sold to leading Swiss banks, as well as to the Swiss National Bank . . . . Th e m oney [from the gold sales] was then left on deposit in vari - ous numbered accounts to be invested in Switzerland and in other neutral c ountries, and ultimately to maintain the Bormann party apparatus abroad.” Ironically, it was a 1934 law passed in Switzerland that preserved Nazi l oot. Th e law that prohibited the disclosure of the owners of private bank accounts was initially meant to keep the Gestapo from locating the sav - ings of German Jews. To this day, it has been used to hide Nazi wealth. T oday many American corporations have followed Bormann’s lead by de - positing their money in Swiss banks."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"THE WRITING ON THE WALL 115 Swiss offi cials claim that their policies toward the Allied and Axis powers were those of balanced neutrality, but the scales were heavily tipped in favor of the Nazis, at least on economic matters. “Declassifi ed intelligence reports reveal that Swiss banks, particularly the Swiss Na - tional Bank, accepted gold looted from the national treasuries of Nazi- o ccupied countries and from dead Jews alike, gold they either bought outright or laundered for the Nazis before sending it on to other neutral countries,” wrote Adam LeBor, author of Hitler’s Secret Bankers: Th e Myth of Swiss Neutrality During the Holocaust. According to LeBor, “Swiss banks supplied the foreign currency that the Th ird Reich needed to buy vital war material. Swiss banks were the vital financial conduit that al - lowed Nazi economic offi cia ls to channel their loot to a safe haven in Switzerland. Swiss banks financed Nazi foreign intelligence operations by providing funds for German front companies in Spain and Portugal.” Bormann had a personal account at the Reichsbank under the fi cti - tious name “Max Heiliger,” into which he siphoned a substantial portion o f the Reich’s wealth. Utilizing both gold and “treasure,” Bormann, through his chief of economics, Dr. Helmut von Hummel, sent these riches out of the country for later use. Abs presents a classic example of the survivability of high-level bankers. H e not only survived the war but was instrumental in Germany’s postwar revival, becoming a financial adviser to West Germany’s first chancellor, Konrad Adenauer. He maintained his positions on the boards of Deut - sche Bank, Daimler-Benz, and Siemens. In 1978, Abs headed a West Ger - man consortium that managed to buy and return nearly $20 million w orth of artwork taken from Germany in the 1930s by the Jewish Baron Robert von Hirsch. Later that same year, Abs addressed American busi - ness leaders at a meeting chaired by fellow banker John J. McCloy, one - time chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, the Ford Foundation, and the Co uncil on Foreign Relations. McCloy served as a member of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Warren Commission and was a legal adviser to the Rocke fel ler family. It was Abs who had prevented two American banks in France—Morgan et C ie and Chase of New York—from being closed or controlled by the German occupation authorities. According to U.S. Treasury reports cited"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"116 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH by Manning, this exemption came through an “unspoken understanding among international bankers that wars may come and go but the fl ux of wealth goes on forever.” Th is “ understanding” was principally between Abs and Lord Hartley Shawcross, a leader in the City of London financial center and a board member of many international companies. Shawcross, a lawyer who was a special adviser to Morgan Guaranty Trust of New York as well as the two American banks in France, was later named chief prosecutor for Britain in the Nuremberg war crimes trials. In the 1950s, Shawcross, along with his friend Dr. Abs, formed the Society for the Protection of Foreign In - vestments of World War II, headquartered in Cologne, West Germany. Bormann’s Operation Eagle Flight was substantially helped by the close c onnections with foreign banks and businesses begun long before the war. According to former U.S. Department of Justice Nazi War Crimes pros - ecutor John Loft us , much of the wealth was passed out of Germany by German banker Fritz Th yssen through his bank in Holland, which, in turn, owned the Union Banking Corporation (UBC) in New York City. Loft us is president of the Florida Holocaust Museum and the author of several books on CIA-Nazi connections, including Th e Belarus Secret and Th e Secret War Against the Jews . Two prominent U.S. business leaders who supported Hitler and served o n the board of directors of the Union Banking Corporation were George Herbert Walker and his son-in-law Prescott Bush, father of George H. W. Bush and grandfather of President George W. Bush. Th e attorneys for these dealings were John Foster Dulles and his brother Allen. John later became secretary of state under President Dwight D. Eisenhower while Allen became one of the longest-serving CIA directors before being fired by President John F. Kennedy in 1961. Both were original members of the Council on Foreign Relations. On October 20, 1942, the offi c e of U.S. Alien Property Custodian, operating under the “Trading With the Enemy Act” (U.S. Government Vesting Order No. 248), seized the shares of UBC on the grounds that the bank was financing Hitler. Also seized were Bush’s holdings in the Hamburg-America ship line that had been used to ferry Nazi propagan - dists and arms. Another company essential to the passing of Nazi money"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"THE WRITING ON THE WALL 117 was the Holland American Trading Company, a subsidiary of UBC. It was through Fritz Th yssen’s Dutch Bank, originally founded by Th yssen’s father in 1916, that Nazi money was passed. Th is Dutch connection tied the Bush and Nazi money directly to former SS offi cer and found er of the Bilderberg Group, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, who was once secretary to the board of directors of I. G. Farben, with close connections to the Dutch Bank. Loft us noted, “Th yssen did not need any foreign bank accounts because his family secretly owned an entire chain of banks. He did not have to transfer his Nazi assets at the end of World War II, all he had to do was transfer the ownership documents—stocks, bonds, deeds, and trusts—from his bank in Berlin through his bank in Holland to his American friends in New York City: Prescott Bush and Herbert Walker. Th yssen’s partners in crime were the father and father-in-law of a future president of the United States.” Th e l eading shareholder in UBC was E. Roland Harriman, son of Ed - ward H. Harriman, who had been an early and important mentor to P rescott Bush. Another son, Averell Harriman, also held ownership in UBC. He was named ambassador to the Soviet Union by President Roo - sevelt in 1943 and participated in all major wartime conferences. Averell la ter became ambassador to Great Britain, U.S. secretary of commerce, and governor of New York State. Both Harrimans had been members of the Yale secret society Skull and Bones and were closely connected to the globalists at the Council on Foreign Relations. Averell also was a close advisor to President Lyndon Johnson. On November 17, 1942, U.S. authorities also seized the Silesian- A merican Corporation, managed by Prescott Bush and his father-in-law, George Herbert Walker, and charged the firm with being a Nazi front company that was supplying vital coal to Germany. But according to gov - ernment documents that have recently come to light and were published by the New Hampshire Gazette in 2003, “the grandfather of President George W. Bush failed to divest himself of more than a dozen ‘enemy na - tional’ relationships that continued as late as 1951.” Th e n ewly released documents also showed that Bush and his associates routinely tried to conceal their business activities from government investigators and that such dealings were conducted through the New York private banking"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"118 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH firm of Brown Brothers Harriman. Brown Brothers Harriman, the oldest privately owned bank in America, was formed in 1931 when the Brown brothers, originally importers of Irish linen, merged with railroad tycoon Edward H.

Th is may be due to the fact that the patriarch Bush was “instrumental in the creation of the USO in late 1941,” according to a news release from the United Service Organization in 2002. Aft er all, it would have looked very bad during wartime to publicly prosecute as a Nazi asset the man who helped create the USO, so beloved by U.S. ser - vicemen in all subsequent wars. “Th e s tory of Prescott Bush and Brown Brothers Harriman is an intro - duction to the real history of our country,” said publisher and historian E dward Boswell. “It exposes the money-making motives behind our for - eign policies, dating back a full century. Th e ab ility of Prescott Bush and the Harrimans to bury their checkered pasts also reveals a collusion be - tween Wall Street and the media that exists to this day.” It was rumored that the trial transcripts of the 1942 prosecution of Pre scott Bush were destroyed in the September 11, 2001, collapse of World Trade Center 7, which housed offi ces of the Securities and Ex - change Commission.

Such ship - ments through Spain to Hamburg indirectly but materially assisted the A xis. “While American civilians and the armed services suff ered alike from restrictions, more gasoline went to Spain than it did to domestic customers,” noted Higham. Questioned about this by the Ne w York Times, a spokesman for U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull explained that the oil was coming from the Caribbe an, not the United States. What was not explained was that Standard Oil, under the leadership of William Stamps Farish, had early on changed the country of registration for Standard’s tanker fl eet to Panama. Higham claimed that both Standard chiefs, Farish and Teagle, were “mesmerized by Germany” and were close associates of I. G. Farben’s president Hermann Schmitz. Th e person who authorized the masking of Standard’s shipping through Panamanian registry was then- undersecretary of the navy James V. Forrestal, also a vice president of General Aniline and Film (GAF). Another aspect of Bormann’s flight capital program concerned Her - mann Schmitz, who, as a director of Th ysse n’s steel empire, owned com - panies in neutral Sweden, along with other German firms. Schmitz’s S wedish firms built ships and transported coal and coke. “A further exam - ple of masked investment was the money paid into the Swedish shipping fi rm of Rederi A/B Skeppsbron, which received a German-guaranteed loan of $3 million . . . in which the vessels were mortgaged to the lender,” explained Paul Manning. “Although the Swedish company remained of - ficia lly the owner of the vessels, the Hamburg-Amerika line [part of Pres - cott Bush’s holdings] was the real owner.” “It is bad enough that the Bush family helped raise the money for Th ys- sen to give Hitler his start in the 1920s, but giving aid and comfort to the"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"120 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH enemy in time of war is treason,” declared Nazi prosecutor Loft us. “Th e Bush’s bank helped the Th yssens make the Nazi steel that killed Allied soldiers.

Th ere are six million skeletons in the Th yssen family closet, and a myriad of criminal and historical questions to be answered about the Bush family complicity.” A LONG W I TH THE desire to create a Nazi-directed Euro pean economy, Martin Bormann and his henchmen also drew up plans to create a new generation of National Socialists, beginning in Germany but with an eye toward other nations. Heimschulen , o r home schools, were created within Germany to train youngsters in the techniques of explosives and sabotage as well as how to live and act in foreign countries. “In the spring of 1943, the curriculum of these schools was changed slightly,” stated Curt Reiss. “Th is was logical, for since the leaders of the Th ird Reich no longer expected to win this war, they now began to put the accent on the work that would have to be done aft er the war. Instead of developing spies and saboteurs, these schools were put to the task of developing workers for the coming underground.” In a move that has been duplicated within the modern U.S. intelli - gence community, many SS members seemingly resigned from the Black S hirts but secretly retained their loyalty and affi liation. In today’s intelli - gence parlance, this is called “sheep dipping.” “Th ese m en will leave the SS for good. Some of them will even leave the party, so as to be completely neutralized. Th ese latter may offi cially disavow the party before public witnesses, who can be used later to testify how anti-Nazi they have been for a long time,” wrote Reiss. “Several intelligence services have commented on the sudden disap - pearance of important personalities from [Germany’s] political and party l ife,” wrote Reiss in 1944. “And it has become quite the accepted thing to everybody in Germany. But what has not yet become known is that all this also applies to a much greater number of anonymous persons all over Germany, those on the second and third levels of the Nazi strata."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"THE WRITING ON THE WALL 121 “Th ese unknown personalities may be used later by the underground.

Th e pa rty helps in their masquerades. Th ese men get new documents which ‘prove’ that they have always been anti- Nazi. Notes are inserted in their personal files saying they must be watched on account of their anti-Hitler attitudes and ‘unworthy’ behavior. Some of them will undoubtedly be sent to concentration camps for crimes which they have never committed, but which will make them look dependable in the eyes of the Allies; some have perhaps already succeeded in joining anti-Nazi circles and are pretending to conspire against Hitler. Later on they will be able to use such activities as alibis.” Nazi sympathizers across the world were brought into the plan for res - urrecting National Socialism through the Auslandsorganisation (AO), or t he League of Germans Abroad. Various forms of this organization had been in existence since the 1800s and have manipulated thousands of per - sons in many diff eren t countries. In Czech o slo vak i a, Holland, Be lgium, and Norway, members aided the Nazi invasions, becoming known as “fi ft h columnists.” “[T]he Nazis, long before they came to power, put their men or men t hey trusted into these leagues. At a party meeting in Hamburg it was decided to set up Nazi cells within all these organizations. That was in 1930. One year later Rudolf Hess formed a special Foreign Department of the [Reich Leadership] of the National Socialist Party, which established card files on every member who lived abroad or traveled abroad. Th is was the basis of the gigantic files which the AO was to organize later,” stated Reiss. In 1944, Reiss pondered when the flight capital program might bear f ruit. “How long it will take for the Nazis to come back, to emerge on the surface—if they succeed in their aims—is a question which cannot be answered at all. Even under the most favorable circumstances—that is, most favorable for them—it will take ten or fift een years. Even then it would be a blitzkrieg, an underground blitzkrieg with somewhat diff erent conceptions of time,” he wrote. “Th e Italian underground needed a half century to achieve its goal, the Irish a whole century, the Bonapartists"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"122 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH thirty- fi ve years, and the Rus sian Socialists twenty-fi ve.

Some call it revolution. Some call it a new order. W hatever we call it, it must come about. If it does not, the Nazi un - derground will live and fl o urish.

Th e re remain long-standing controversies over the proclaimed deaths of prominent Nazis, including Martin Bormann; the notorious SS Dr. Josef Mengele, the “Angel of Extermination” at Auschwitz; and Gestapo chief, SS Gruppenfuehrer Heinrich “Gestapo” Mueller.

Toward the end of the war, Mueller distanced himself from his boss Himmler and moved closer to Bormann. Aft er he slipped away from Hitler’s bunker in the last days of the Reich, Mueller’s family declared him dead and erected a tombstone in a Berlin cemetery, with the inscription OUR DEAR DADDY .

But the biggest fi s h to get away was Reichsleiter Bormann, the ultimate power behind the Nazi super-science projects and the architect of Opera - tion Eagle Flight. In 1972, Munich bishop Johannes Neuhausler made p ublic a postwar church document stating that Bormann had escaped Berlin during the final days and gone to Spain by airplane. The next year, aft er journalist Paul Manning published an article in the New York Times detailing Bormann’s escape from justice, West German offi cials held a news conference proclaiming that Berlin workmen had unearthed two skeletons near the ruins of the Lehrter railroad station and that one of the skeletons had been identifi ed as Bormann. He died in 1945 trying to escape Berlin, they stated. However, the entire case for the Berlin death of Bormann rested on d ental records prepared from memory by a dentist who had been a loyal Nazi for many years, and the sole statement of a dental technician who had been imprisoned in Rus sia due to his proclaimed knowledge of Bor- mann’s dental work. Adding to suspicions that Bormann’s death an - nouncement was most conve nient for anyone wishing to cover Bormann’s tr acks was the fact that Willy Brandt’s government canceled all rewards and warrants for Bormann and instructed West German embassies and consulates to ignore any future sightings of the Reichsleiter. Th ese sus picions were compounded by statements from several persons who told Paul Manning that the body found near the railroad station was placed there in 1945 by SS troops commanded by “Gestapo” Mueller, who was known to have used decoy bodies on other occasions. Bormann’s death notice did not convince the late Simon Wiesenthal of t he Documentation Center in Vienna, who said, “Some doubts must re - main whether the bones found in Berlin are really those of Bormann.” One o f Bormann’s relatives had no doubts. In 1947, Walter Buch, the father of Bormann’s wife, Gerda, declared on his deathbed, “Th at damn Martin made it safely out of Germany.” According to Manning, Bormann was escorted from dying Berlin by sel ected SS men who passed him along a series of “safe houses” to Munich,"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"THE RATLINES 127 where he hid out with his brother, Albert. In early 1946, Bormann was escorted on foot over the Alps to the northern Italian seaport of Genoa. Th ere Bormann was housed in a Franciscan monastery. All this was ar - ranged by “Gestapo” Mueller. In mid-1946, a steamer ship carried Bormann, provided with false iden tifi cation papers, to Spain, where he entered the Dominican monas - tery of San Domingos in the province of Galicia, once the home of Span - ish dictator Francisco Franco, a supposed neutral who covertly supported H itler. Manning noted that in 1969, when Bormann became aware that Israeli agents were sniffi ng along his escape route, there was a fire in San Domingos. Curiously, the fire started on the very shelves where the mon - astery kept its book of visitors, which contained Bormann’s name. Th is i ncriminating record suspiciously was destroyed. In the winter of 1947, a large freighter carrying Bormann and several SS offi cers anchored in the harbor of Buenos Aires, where an organized network of supporters awaited them. Even before the shooting war ended, lesser-known SS members and ha rdcore Nazis were fanning out across the world through covert distri - bution systems. Th e m eans was a loosely knit collection of escape routes from Europe, called “ratlines.” Chief among these ratlines were the Kameradenwerk and the ODESSA, the Or ga ni za tion der ehemaligen SS- Angehorigen, or the organization of former SS members. ODESSA was created by Bormann and Mueller, but later administered by Otto Skorzeny, who had escaped war crimes convictions. Documentation of these ratlines is so incomplete and fragmentary that so me historians, taking their cue from the corporate world, have denied that ODESSA existed outside the fevered dreams of fanatical SS men. Ladislas Farago, author of popular histories as well as an acclaimed biog - raphy of General George Patton, also wrote that he had proof of Bor- ma nn’s postwar survival. He acknowledged ODESSA’s existence but wrote it was “actually little more than a shadowy consortium of a handful of freelancers and never amounted to much in the Nazi underground.” But then, in 1976, Louis L. Snyder, professor of history at the City Co llege and the City University of New York, produced the mammoth"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"128 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Encyclopedia of the Th ird Reich. Snyder described ODESSA as a “vast clandestine Nazi travel organization” to aid the escape of SS members and top Nazis. He noted that the main terminal point for ODESSA was Buenos Aires. According to Farago, the Ka meradenwerk was the real focal point for escaping Nazis. It was founded by Luft waff e colonel Hans Ulrich Rudel, an air ace who lost a leg fl ying 2,530 combat missions for Germany. Aft er the war, Rudel almost alone put together one of the most far-reaching and best financed of the rescue groups—the Kameradenwerk . Rudel’s group had help but, according to Farago, it did not come from the Bormann underground but from “the vast organization and the enormous resources of the one agency that, in the end, took care of more Nazis than all the others combined—the refugee bureau of the Vatican.” To understand the seemingly puzzling relationship between Hitler’s N azis and the Holy Roman Church, one must look back to a 1929 agree - ment signed between the Vatican and the government of fascist Italy. Un - der this concordat, known as the Lateran Treaty, the Italian government b ought favor from the Church by paying almost a billion lire in gold as compensation for church property taken during the nineteenth- century Risorgimento , or reor ganization, that helped create modern Italy. Th e Lat - eran Treaty also established Vatican City in Rome as a sovereign state, as w ell as making Roman Catholicism the only state religion in Italy. On July 20, 1933, a similar concordat was reached between Pope Pius X I and Nazi Germany. Treaty negotiations were handled by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, who signed on behalf of the pope and later became Pope Pius XII. Th is concordat, still in eff ect today, was signed by Franz von Papen on behalf of German president Paul von Hinderburg. Von Papen was tried at Nuremberg but released despite being denounced as a primary mover in Hitler’s aggression in Europe. According to the 1933 concordat, there was to be no interference by t he Church in political aff airs. It also required all bishops to take a loyalty oath to the state and required all priests to be German citizens and subor - dinate to government offi cia ls. Prior to the concordat’s ratifi cation, the Nazi government also reached similar agreements with the major Protes - tant churches. Hitler, who at a young age trained at a Catholic monastery"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"THE RATLINES 129 school and strived to reach accommodations with the German churches, once proclaimed, “I believe today that my c onduct is in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator.” Rumors have circulated for years that a secret codicil of the concordat i nvolved papal leniency toward National Socialism in exchange for Ca - tholicism being proclaimed the state religion of Europe aft er an appropri - ate period of time of total Nazi control. Regardless, it mattered little, as H itler quickly took steps against all churches, including the Catholics. His sterilization laws, attempts to dissolve the Catholic Youth League, and arrests of priest, nuns, and lay leaders all angered the Catholic com - munity. In March 1937, Pope Pius XI issued an encyclical letter titled “M it Brennender Sorge,” or “With Burning Sorrow.” In the letter, the pope accused the Nazis of both violating and evading the concordat and even foresaw “threatening storm clouds” of war and extermination. A year later, Pius XI addressed the Nazi persecution of the Jews by proclaiming worldwide, “Mark well that in the Catholic Mass, Abraham is our patri - arch and forefather. Anti-Semitism is incompatible with the loft y thought which that fact expresses . . . . I say to you it is impossible for a Christian to ta ke part in anti-Semitism. It is inadmissible. Th rough Christ and in Christ we are the spiritual progeny of Abraham. Spiritually, we are all Semites.” But if Pius XI’s turn against National Socialism was legitimate, it un - fortunately was short-lived. On February 10, 1939, the day before Pius XI w as scheduled to deliver yet another scathing public attack on fascism and anti-Semitism, he died, reportedly of a massive heart attack. Copies of his planned antifascist speech have never been found. Vatican offi cials have stated they may have been misfiled. Rumors implicated Dr. Francesco Saverio Petacci in the pope’s sudden death. Petacci, one of the Vatican physicians at the time, was the father of Clara Petacci, the longtime mis - tress of Fascist leader Benito Mussolini. Th e wh ispers were that Petacci gave the pope an injection that caused his fatal attack. Strong support for this rumor came some years later, when the same allegation was found in the personal diary of French cardinal and former French Army intelli - gence agent Eugene Tisserant. Pope Pius XII, born Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli, was"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"130 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH certainly less antagonistic toward fascism and, in fact, had been an hon - ored guest at the society wedding of Clara Petacci and Italian Air Force L ieutenant Riccardo Federici in 1934. Th e marriage did not last long, and Clara was soon visiting Mussolini at night via a secret staircase in the Pal - azzo Venezia. Catholic historian and journalist John Cornwell, in 1999, stunned the Ca tholic world with his book Hitler’s Pope . A former seminary student, Cornwell explained that he originally intended to defend the actions of Pope Pius XII but as his research in Vatican archives progressed, his atti - tude changed. “By the middle of 1997, nearing the end of my research, I fo und myself in a state I can only describe as moral shock. Th e material I had gathered, taking the more extensive view of Pacelli’s life, amounted not to an exoneration but to a wider indictment,” Cornwell wrote. Th e author eventually saw that this pope’s actions—or inaction—actually aided in Hitler’s rise to power and the ensuing Holocaust. Needless to say, Cornwell’s perception was immediately and savagely a ttacked as inaccurate reporting and misinterpretation. In the December 9, 2004, edition of Th e Economist, Cornwell waffl ed, writing, “I would now argue, in light of the debates and evidence following Hitler’s Pope, that Pius XII had so little scope of action that it is impossible to judge the motives for his silence during the war, while Rome was under the heel of Mussolini and later occupied by Germany.” Regardless of motives, it is historical fact that many top Nazis and SS m en escaped Europe with passports issued by Catholic offi cials. Luft waff e ace Rudel admitted as much in 1970, stating, “In Rome itself, the transit point of the escape routes, a vast amount was done. With its own im - mense resources, the Church helped many of us to go overseas.” One of those helpful clerics was Bishop Alois Hudal, who voiced opin - ions comparable to those of Hitler’s Viennese friend Jorg Lanz von Lie - benfels, publisher of O stara, a magazine with occult and erotic themes. A Cistercian monk who founded the anti-Semitic secret Order of the New Templars, von Liebenfels and his mentor Guido von List sought to revive the medieval brotherhood of Teutonic Knights, those heroes of Hitler’s youth, who had used the swastika as an emblem. While von Liebenfels headed his Order of the New Templars, Bishop Hudal was named procu -"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"THE RATLINES 131 rator general of the Catholic Order of German Knights. On May 1, 1933, in a Nazi- sanctioned celebration of the pagan Walpurgis holiday, Hudal made a particularly impassioned s peech in Rome before assembled Church and Nazi leaders as well as the expatriate German community. “German unity is my strength, my strength is German might,” he told the crowd. It was, in fact, a Franciscan friar serving under Bishop Hudal who h elped arrange a Red Cross passport and visa to Argentina in 1950 for Obersturmbannfuehrer Adolf Eichmann, the exterminator of Jews who had managed to slip away from American captors at the end of the war. Bishop Hudal, in his later memoirs, thanked God he was able to help so many escape with false identity papers. Many of these “false identity papers” were documents issued by the C ommissione Pontifi cia d’Assistenza, or the Vatican Refugee Organiza - tion. While not full passports themselves, these Vatican identity papers w ere used to obtain a Displaced Person passport from the International Red Cross, which, in turn, was used to gain a visa. Supposedly, the Red Cross checked the backgrounds of applicants, but usually it was suffi cient to have the word of a priest or a bishop. Th is method of aiding escaping Nazis—the one favored by Bishop Hudal—came to be known as the “Vatican ratlines.” For example, Ante Pavelic, the wartime pro-Nazi fascist dictator of C roatia, who was given a private audience with Pope Pius XII shortly af - ter taking power in 1941, escaped to South America aft e r the war with a Red Cross passport gained through a Vatican document. O NE OF THE countries in which the Auslandsorganisation worked with particular success was Argentina. “Th ere it has been able to operate with - out any disguise or front. All of the more than 200,000 Argentine Nazis a re members, not of an Argentine subor ganization of the Nazi Party, but of the German Party itself, and hold membership cards signed by Robert Ley, leader of the German Workers’ Front—which means, quite obvi - ously, that Berlin considered, and still considers, Argentina not so much a n independent foreign country as a German Gau [district],” noted Curt Reiss."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"132 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Although many Nazis found safe havens in Brazil, Paraguay, Chile, and Uruguay, no South American nation was more accommodating than the Argentina of Dictator Juan Domingo Peron and his lovely second wife, Eva Maria Duarte de Peron, popularly known as Evita. Aft e r participating in a successful military coup in 1943, Peron was voted in as president in 1946 by a majority of voters, who lauded his ef - forts to eliminate poverty and dignify workers. He was elected against the i ntense and overt opposition of the United States. Such opposition ap - peared justifi ed , for soon after his election Peron began to nationalize and expropriate British and American businesses. As their infl uence in Argen - tina dwindled, that of the Germans grew. Luft wa ff e pilot Rudel, who created the Kameradenwerk ratline, be - came a trainer for Peron’s air force and in the pro cess brought with him abo ut one hundred members of the wartime Luft waff e staff . Likewise, many Nazi SS and Gestapo fugitives from justice served in the Argentine Army and police forces. Among them was Kurt Tank, who headed a large group of Nazi scientists. Tank, a fi ghter plane designer and former direc - tor of the Focke-Wulf aircraft f actory, had slipped away from Germany in disguise and, armed with false identity papers provided by Peron himself, arrived in Buenos Aires with microfilm of aircraft designs hidden in his pants. Soon, about sixty of his old Nazi comrades had joined him, using the same system. T HE M A N MOST responsible for fostering pro-Nazi feelings in South America was General Wilhelm von Faupel. In 1900, Faupel went to China as a member of the German military legation. He later went to Moscow in the same capacity. In 1911, he joined the staff of the Argentine War Col - lege in Buenos Aires. Faupel returned to Argentina aft e r serving Germany in World War I and obtained the job of military counselor to the inspec - tor general of the Argentine Army. Von Faupel not only imparted military t heories to the armies of Argentina, Brazil, and Peru, he also instilled in them the political theories of National Socialism. “Hating the [Weimar] republic passionately, he did not return to Germany until the Nazis were about to take power,” wrote Curt Reiss. “But while he was away he had"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"THE RATLINES 133 kept up excellent relations with industrialists such as Fritz Th yssen, Georg von Schnitzler, and Herr von Schroeder. Aft er all, these gentlemen had elaborate interests in Latin America. And so had von Faupel. In fact, he boasted openly among German military and industrial men that he could conquer the whole of Latin America.” Faupel most likely was speaking for many globalists who had signifi cant holdings in South America and did not wish to relinquish them to left ists, communists, nationalists, or re - formers. Although he is widely seen as a dictator, many “Peronists” still view J uan Peron as a champion of the working man. Few realized at the time that he was stashing away an estimated $500 million in Swiss bank ac - counts. According to Manning, at least $100 million came from the Bor - mann organization. Peron reciprocated for this generosity by allowing ma ny war criminals to immigrate, legally and illegally, to Argentina. He reportedly provided more than a thousand blank passports for escaping Nazis. Peron was an admirer of Hitler. He had learned German at a young age so h e could read Mein Kampf. His private secretary, Rudolfo Freude, also was chief of internal security. Th e Argentine dictator was greatly honored to shelter Deputy Fuehrer Bormann. Aft er several low-key meetings with Bormann, Peron saw Bormann’s flight capital program as a means of boosting the Argentine economy. “Both realized that the capture of Bormann was a clear and ever-present d anger,” noted Paul Manning, “and so Peron instructed the chief of his secret police to give all possible cooperation to Heinrich Mueller in his task of protecting the party minister, a collaboration that continued for years.” Evita took on the role of liaison between her husband and Nazis seek - ing asylum. “Born in 1919 as an illegitimate child, she became a prostitute t o survive and to get acting roles,” wrote investigative reporter Georg Hodel. “As she climbed the social ladder lover by lover, she built up deep resentments toward the traditional elites. As a mistress to other army of - fice rs, she caught the eye of handsome military strongman Juan Peron. Aft er a public love aff air, they married in 1945.” In June 1947, Eva Peron embarked on a much-publicized “Rainbow"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"134 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Tour” of Europe, greeted royally by Spain’s Franco and a private audience with Pope Pius XII. While in Spain, she reportedly met with Otto Skorzeny, who headed a ratline known as die Spinne or the Spider, and ar - ranged the transfer of millions in Nazi loot to Argentina. She also traveled t o Genoa, where she met with Argentine shipping fl eet owner Alberto Dodero, who within a month was ferrying Nazis to South America. But the primary purpose of the trip appeared to be the meetings Evita held with bankers in Switzerland. “According to records now emerging from Swiss archives and the inves - tigations of Nazi hunters, an unpublicized side of Evita’s world tour was c oordinating the network for helping Nazis relocate in Argentina,” wrote Hodel. “Th ough Evita’s precise role on organiz ing the Nazi ‘ratlines’ re - mains a bit fuzzy, her Europe an tour connected the dots of the key figures i n the escape network. She also helped clear the way for more formal ar - rangements in the Swiss-Argentine-Nazi collaboration.” In 1955, Peron was ousted in a military coup and forced to fl ee to neighboring Paraguay and later to exile in Madrid, Spain. He left without the body of Eva, who had died from cancer in 1952, at age thirty-three. Her popularity was such that eight persons were trampled to death in the tumultuous crowds who fl ocked to see her embalmed body lying in state. According to Manning, the relationship between Bormann and Peron “ became somewhat frayed around the edges aft er Peron left for Panama and then exile in Spain in 1955, but [Gestapo] Mueller today [1981] still wields power with the Argentinian secret police in all matters concerning Germans and the [Nazis] in South America.” T HE I M PACT OF transplanted Nazis continues to be felt in South Amer - ica. “Th ose a ging fascists accomplished much of what the ODESSA strat - egists had hoped,” noted Georg Hodel, adding, “Th e N azis in Argentina kept Hitler’s torch burning, won new converts in the region’s militaries and passed on the advanced science of torture and ‘death squad’ opera - tions.

Using his contacts in the Kameradenwerk, he began running guns between Bolivia, Peru, and Chile. “The gun trade eventually led them into the drug trade,” wrote Levenda. On July 17, 1980, Barbie abetted right-wing offi ce rs in the army during a coup over the left -of-center Bolivian government. “Barbie’s team hunted down and slaughtered government offi cials and labor leaders, while Ar - gentine specialists fl e w in to demonstrate the latest torture techniques,” wrote Hodel. With Barbie’s aid, Bolivia was soon a primary and secure source of cocaine for the emerging Medellín drug cartel. Two years later, Barbie was captured and extradited to France, where he died in 1991 from cancer while serving a life sentence for crimes against humanity. ODESSA also turned to gun-running as a means of financing its oper - ations. In fact, it was never intended only as an escape route for Nazis, but, a t Bormann’s instructions, it was set up as a profi table business enterprise as well. Th e plentiful supply of surplus arms in Europe turned out to be an immediately profi table commodity. In late 1945, U.S. military authorities became aware of a huge black ma rket enterprise being operated out of Passau, a picturesque city located ninety miles northeast of Munich at the confl uence of the Danube, Inn, and Ilz Rivers. It was a connecting point between Germany, Austria, and Czecho slovaki a, and a collection center for Axis arms. It was here that the weapons from three complete armies—the Hungarian Fift h Army and the German Fift h and Twelft h Armies—were stockpiled in an American-run depot. Rifl es, machine guns, and ammunition were gathered at Passau while millions of dollars worth of vehicles were cached at Mattinghoff en, Austria. About $10 million worth of these war materials went missing, sold by b lack marketers, mainly ODESSA agents, German offi cials, and crimi - nals, aided by a few Allied soldiers.

Th is began in 1917, when 2nd Baron Rothschild, Lionel Walter Rothschild, received a letter from British for - eign secretary Arthur Balfour replying to his query regarding Balfour’s pos ition on Palestine. Balfour expressed approval for the establishment of a home for Jews there. Th is letter later became known as the Balfour Dec - laration. In 1922, the League of Nations approved the Balfour mandate in P alestine, thus paving the way for the later creation of Israel. Lord Roth - schild was an ardent Zionist, who had served as a member of the British P arliament. Th e Zionist movement, composed of both Jews and non-Jews, had been working toward the creation of Israel since the late 1800s. Lord Rothschild was the eldest son of Nathan Rothschild, who had controlled the Bank of En gland and funded the Cecil Rhodes diamond (and secret society) empire. Another Rothschild, Baron Edmond de Rothschild, who built the first pipeline from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean and founded the Israel General Bank, was called “the father of modern Israel.” It also appears that the Zionists employed blackmail to aid in the for - mation of Israel. Th e ir most famous target was Nelson Rocke feller, who in 1940 was named to the intelligence position of coordinator of inter- American aff airs by Secretary of Defense Forrestal. In 1944, Rocke - feller was selected to serve as assistant secretary of state for Latin Ameri - can aff a irs. It was a post most suitable to Rocke feller, whose primary purpose, according to authors Loft us and Aarons, was “to monopolize Latin America’s raw materials and exclude the Europe ans.” Due to the extensive business dealings between the German Nazis and American globalists, as detailed previously, Loft us and Aarons noted that during the war, the Germans in South America got anything they wanted, from refueling stations to espionage bases, while the British had to pay cash. “Behind Rocke feller’s rhetoric of taking measures in Latin America for the national defense stood a naked grab for profits,” they wrote. “Under the cloak of his offi cial position, Rocke feller and his cronies would take over Britain’s most valuable Latin American properties. If the British resisted, he would eff ectively block raw materials and food supplies des - perately needed for Britain’s fight against Hitler.”"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"138 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Soon, Rocke feller controlled much of South America and was able to bring that infl uence to the newly created United Nations. But when Rocke feller pushed through UN membership for pro-fascist Argentina over the objections of President Truman, he lost his government position. He returned to the world of business. According to Loft us and Aarons, his “partner in moneymaking just happened to be John Foster Dulles, a trustee of the Rocke feller Foundation and a fellow conspirator in smug - gling Axis money to safety.” In 1947, when Zionist leader David Ben-Gurion was desperate for votes t o ensure the passage of a UN resolution partitioning Palestine and thus creating the state of Israel, he turned to Nelson Rocke feller. According to several former U.S. intelligence agents, Ben-Gurion “blackmailed the hell out of him.” Rocke feller had been able to defl ect se veral investigations into his fam- ily’s prewar and wartime dealings with the Nazis, but according to Loft us and Aarons, “Th en the Jews arrived with their dossier.

Die Spinne was a creation of commando Otto Skorzeny and was largely c omposed of troops from his old wartime commando unit. It was funded through the Bormann program. Aft er the meeting with Eva Peron in 1947, many Spinne members made their way to Argentina. “[T]he number of Germans who went to South America, both along t hese . . . routes and by less organized means aft er Martin Bormann had declared his flight capital program in August 1944, totaled 60,000, in - cluding scientists and administrators at all levels, as well as the former SS so ldiers commanded by General Mueller,” noted Paul Manning. Even before the end of the war, the Nazis used concentration camp p risoners and hired specialists to manufacture respectable-looking but phony identifi cation papers. With these and aided by the general chaos in Europe at war’s end, they developed their own eff ective witness protection program. Many of these false identities have withstood the test of time and are still in use. While on the run at the end of the war, Bormann controlled his vast c ommercial empire through an elaborate but well-planned communica - tions system. “Wherever positioned, he turned his hiding place into a pa rty headquarters, and was in command of everything save security,” explained Manning. “Telephones were too dangerous, but he had couriers to bear documents to Sweden, where a Bormann commercial headquar - ters was maintained in Malmö [Sweden] to handle the aff a irs of a complex and growing postwar business empire. From Malmö, high-frequency ra - dio could transmit coded information to listening posts in Switzerland, S pain, or Argentina to form a continuous line of instructions.” Th e d eputy fuehrer’s escape had not gone unnoticed. It was substanti - ated by a file on Bormann sent to the FBI and obtained by Paul Manning. “ When the file . . . was received at FBI headquarters it revealed that the Reichsleiter had indeed been tracked for years,” he wrote. “One report covered [Bormann’s] whereabouts from 1948 to 1961, in Argentina, Para - guay, Brazil, and Chile.

He overheard one of the men acknowledge the short, balding man who obvi - ously was the superior of the three by saying, “ Jawohl, Herr Bormann.” By 1972, it was apparent to anyone who desired to know that Martin B ormann had been operating in South America for some time. Researcher and author Ladislas Farago caused a minor sensation in that year with his articles published in En gland’s Daily Express, detailing Bormann’s activi - ties. In 1974, Farago used his findings on Bormann in his book Aft er - math: Martin Bormann and the Fourth Reich. His investigative work led to a N ew York Times story published on No - vember 27, 1972, and datelined “Buenos Aires.” It stated, “Argentine se - cret service sources said today that Martin Bormann was sheltered in the cou ntry aft er World War II, but could not confirm reports that he still lived there. Sources in Salta confirmed that the ranch where Bormann was said to have lived was owned by German industrialists. Th e intelli - gence sources said other Nazis arrived in Argentina with Bormann and w ere sheltered there, particularly by Vittorio Mussolini, son of the Italian dictator.” Of course, only Bormann, Mengele, Eichmann, and a few other lead - ing Nazis garnered occasional news headlines. Th o usands managed to slip through the hands of authorities unnoticed, thanks to business connec - tions or passports provided by the Vatican. It seems apparent that it was not only business interests protecting the N azis but individuals within the American government. For example, someone with access to U.S. archives later took steps to obliterate any record of Kammler or his fate.

Somebody . . . had been in and cleaned up [the records].” T HE N A ZI OR GA NI ZA T ION that may have made the greatest impact on the United States was not a ratline but a spy network created by General- major Reinhard Gehlen. Th is Nazi network was to become America’s eyes and ears in the early days of the Cold War. Th e so n of a Catholic bookshop owner, Gehlen was born in 1902 and joined the German Army in 1920. His middle- class family nevertheless boasted military offi cers on both sides. In the 1930s, Gehlen moved from the German Staff College to the Army General Staff with the rank of captain. In 1940, he was promoted to major and served on the staff s of two German generals. By 1942, Gehlen, now a Lieutenant colonel, be - came the head of Fremde Heere Ost, or Foreign Armies East (FHO), a c urious title for the section of the German General Staff analyzing all in - telligence on the Rus sian Front. In an attempt to avoid conflicts with the Abwehr, Germany’s counter - intelligence service, Gehlen created his own network of spies and inform - ers. Th is s ystem soon began making major contributions to the Nazi war effort by upgrading the level of intelligence on the Soviets. Gehlen made use of whatever anticommunists could be found and in particular the anti-Soviet spy network of Rus sian general Andrei Vlasov, a Rus sian of - fice r who began working with Gehlen and the Nazis against the Stalin regime. (With Germany’s defeat, the Allies turned Vlasov and his “Rus- sian Liberation Army” over to Stalin, who had them all executed.) Gehlen soo n put together a remarkable network of agents and spies, all sworn to utmost secrecy, even from their own families. Th is combined Vlasov/ Gehlen operation became known as the Gehlen Organization, a spy net - work that was continued by U.S. authorities long after the war. But Gehlen’s accurate and realistic intelligence soon rankled Hitler, wh o toward the end of the war cried, “Gehlen is a fool!” Such vitriol may"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"THE RATLINES 143 have led to Gehlen lending a sympathetic ear to plotters against Hitler. But whatever his role, if any, in the failed July 1944 bomb plot against the fuehrer, Gehlen managed to survive. By then, he had a new plan—one that was to have lasting eff ect o n the Allied nations and particularly the United States and Rus sia. In April 1945, realizing that the war was lost for the Germans, Gehlen off e red his spy network in Rus sia to the British but received no answer. “Taking everything into consideration, it seemed more expedient to make our approach to the American military forces,” Gehlen recalled. “I sus - pected that once the shooting stopped the Americans would probably re - cover a sense of objectivity toward us more rapidly then their Europe an a llies, and subsequent history bore me out on this point.” Gehlen also showed no signs of being anything other than an unre - pentant National Socialist. In his 1971 memoirs, he stated, “I still believe t hat we could have achieved our 1941 campaign objectives, had it not been for the pernicious interventions of Adolf Hitler.” In other words, Gehlen’s only objection to Nazi aggression was that Hitler lost. Gehlen and his organization stashed their voluminous intelligence files i n more than fift y sealed steel containers and buried them as they re - treated westward—one cache was stored near the Wendelstein Moun - tains, another in the Algau province of southwest Bavaria, and the third in the Hunsruck mountain range in the Rhineland. Aft er hiding out in a mountain lodge for some time, Gehlen made his move. “We were deter - mined not to be taken prisoner,” he later recounted. “We wanted to sur - render on our own initiative to the Americans. It was all part of the pl an.” Initially spurned by American offi ce rs who failed to recognize his im - portance, including a member of the Counterintelligence Corps (CIC), G ehlen finally arrived in front of Brigadier General Edwin L. Sibert, se - nior intelligence offi c er of the American occupation zone in Germany. “While fi ghting was still in progress in France, [Sibert] had been prepared to make use of Adolf Hitler’s offi cers in the cause of American strategy,” wrote Gehlen chroniclers Heinz Hoehne and Hermann Zolling, add - ing, “Th e i dea came from . . . the adviser to Allen W.

Th e t erms of this “gentlemen’s agreement” were as follows: ◆ A clandestine German intelligence organization was to be cre - ated. ◆ Th is organization would work “jointly” with the Americans, but would not be subordinate to them. ◆ Th e organization would operate exclusively under German lead - ership with only assignments coming from the Americans. ◆ Th e organization would be funded by the Americans but not from occupation costs. ◆ Th e organization would remain in American hands until a sover - eign German government was created and agreed to take respon - sibility for the group. ◆ Should the organization at any time find German and American interests in conflict, it would consider the interests of Germany “Th e po litical risk [of this agreement] to which Sibert was exposed was very great,” conceded Gehlen, who was most pleased with the arrange - ment. “Anti-German feeling was running high, and he had created our o rganization without any authority from Washington and without the knowledge of the War Department. I understand that he informed his opposite number in the British zone, Major General Sir Kenneth Strong, of our existence, but he asked him not to inquire too closely into the mat - ter for fear that the press might discover our activities.” Gehlen and some of his staff m embers were soon flown to Washington in a military plane belonging to Walter Bedell Smith, General Eisenhow- er’s chief of staff , who went on to direct the CIA from 1950 to 1953 and .fi r s t"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"THE RATLINES 145 also succeeded Averell Harriman as U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union. Smith was to become an early member of the secretive Bilderberg Group initially headed by former SS officer Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. Gehlen’s self-serving proposal was accepted by Sibert’s military superi - ors, who did not know of the globalists’ control over the Soviet Union a nd, therefore, were easily frightened by Gehlen’s description of this mili - tarily ambitious “evil empire.” Under the proposal, Gehlen would operate i nde pendently and as an equal, off ering the Americans only the informa - tion they requested or he decided to share, but never in any way con - flicting with the interests of his Fatherland. In other words, virtually e verything the United States learned about Soviet aims and capabilities at the end of World War II came from an anticommunist underground fil - tered through a Nazi organization with connections to the international fi nancial elite. Carl Oglesby, author of Th e Y ankee and Cowboy War, wrote that by 1948, following the formation of the CIA, “Gehlen had grown tight with Dulles and his organization and become in eff ect the CIA’s department of Rus sian and East Eu ro pe an aff airs. Soon aft er the formation of NATO [in 1949], [the Gehlen organization] became the offi cial NATO intelli - gence organization.” It has been made public in recent years that the Geh - len organization received an aggregate of $200 million in CIA funds f rom Allen Dulles. Much of Gehlen’s intelligence proved questionable, although this was n ot known at the time, since the Rus sians had tight control over informa - tion behind the Iron Curtain. “Gehlen fl ood ed the Americans with ‘au - thentic’ documents provided by the Byeorus sians,” noted Loft us . “Because the information pertained to Soviet activity in areas where verifi cation was impossible, the Americans had no choice but to view Gehlen’s infor - mation as genuine. In reality, most of the secret intelligence that Gehlen f urnished came from recently arrived émigrés, Soviet newspapers, and mail from Belarus and the Ukraine.” Gehlen went on to an illustrious career in spy craft .

True to the initial agreement, Gehlen became president of the BND from its inception in 1956 until 1968, when he was forced to resign in the wake of a political scandal. Following his death in 1979, Gehlen, a member of the Knights of Malta, was hailed as the consummate Cold Wa r s p y m a s t e r. In 2000, the CIA finally admitted its relationship with Gehlen. As the r esult of a Freedom of Information Act request from Oglesby, the agency fi l e d a n a ffi davit in a U.S. District Court “acknowledging an intelligence relationship with German General Reinhard Gehlen that it has kept se - cret for 50 years.” A NOT H ER FORG OT T E N CON N ECT ION between U.S. authorities and the Nazis was the International Criminal Police Organization, known as In - terpol, which was created as the International Criminal Police Commis - sion in 1924, the same year J. Edgar Hoover became director of the FBI. It w as headquartered in Vienna, Austria. It was established to assist in inter - national police cooperation. In 1938, following the Ansc hluss, or unifi ca - tion, of Germany and Austria, the organization came under Nazi control a nd until the end of World War II functioned as an intelligence and en - forcement arm of the Gestapo. During those years, Interpol was headed by some of the most notorious N azi war criminals, such as SS Obergruppenfuehrer Reinhard Heydrich, who chaired the infamous Wannsee Conference where the Holocaust was planned; Arthur Nebe, the criminal police chief who also commanded Einsatzkommandos, or killer squads, that liquidated “undesirables”; and Ernst Kaltenbrunner, who succeeded the slain Heydrich and was hanged at Nuremberg for war crimes. Working with Heydrich at Interpol was a young SS offi cer named Paul Dickopf. Aft er the war, Dickopf served as president of Interpol from 1968 to 1972.

Th e next year, Interpol was reestablished with strong support from the French police and head - quartered in Paris. Also in 1946, Hoover sidestepped the U.S. State De - partment by attending a meeting in Brussels to formally reconstitute I nterpol, where he was elected vice president. Former U.S. Army intelli - gence offi ce r William Spector stated Hoover gained blackmail leverage over many prominent American business and political leaders by acquir - ing the Nazi/Interpol intelligence files at the end of World War II.

Like other researchers, Hunt found many government files pertaining to recruited Nazis “missing” or otherwise una - vailable. Despite government claims that Paperclip was ended in 1947, ac - cording to Hunt, this project was “the biggest, longest-running operation i nvolving Nazis in our country’s history.” “Th e p roject continued nonstop until 1973— decades longer than was previously thought. And remnants of it are still in operation today,” she wrote. By the 1990s, when details of Paperclip finally reached the public’s ears, the infusion of Nazis into America’s military-industrial complex was complete. I N 1952 , NEW LY elected President Dwight D. Eisenhower was persuaded to name John Foster Dulles as his secretary of state, and his brother, Allen Dulles, as the director of the CIA. “Th e reigning Dulles brothers were the ‘Republican’ replacements for their client and business partner, ‘Demo - crat’ Averell Harriman. Occasional public posturing aside, their strategic c ommitments [to the globalists] were identical to his,” stated authors Webster Griffi n Tarpley and Anton Chaitkin in their well- documented 1992 unauthorized biography of George H. W. Bush. It should be noted"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"PROJECT PAPERCLIP AND THE SPACE RACE 151 that the Dulles brothers were both attorneys for and business partners with Averell Harriman. It should also be noted that Allen Dulles, as OSS station chief in Bern, Switzerland, sat at the nexus of U.S. intelligence as well as Soviet intelligence, such as the infamous Rote Kapelle, or Red Or - chestra, spy network. It was during his stint as assistant to the U.S. ambas - sador that Dulles used SS Brigadefuehrer, or brigadier general, Walter S chellenberg to communicate with his immediate superior, Reichsfuehrer Heinrich Himmler. Dulles constantly sent intelligence reports to Wash - ington, although, as stated by Adam LeBor, “there are questions as to wh ether his motive was supplying genuine economic intelligence or merely building a complicated empire of information and disinformation that reached from Bern to Berlin and back again.” Dulles moved from Bern to become OSS station chief in Berlin at the e nd of the war. In 1947, when the OSS was rolled into the newly created CIA, Dulles’s translator was an army intelligence offi cer named Henry Kissinger, who would go on to become secretary of state under President Richard Nixon, a lifelong friend to Dulles. Project Paperclip quickly came under the control of an “old boy” net - work encompassing members of the globalists centered in the Council on Fore ign Relations. Aft e r its inception, Paperclip was run by the intelligence division of the U.S. Army’s European Command, directed by Robert Walsh operating out of Berlin. “Th e Paperclip offi ce operated out of the intelligence divi- sion’s headquarters in Heidelberg, under Deputy Director Colonel Rob - ert Schow, who would become assistant director of the CIA in 1949 and a ssistant chief of staff for intelligence in 1956,” Hunt wrote in Secret Agenda . She added that offi cers of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency ( JIOA) who managed Project Paperclip soon began receiving security re - ports from Schow’s office, regarding the Germans recruited into the pro - gram. All reports on these men had been altered from a determination of “ ardent Nazi” to read “not an ardent Nazi.” Aft e r assuming the directorship of the newly created CIA, Allen Dulles, who, as attorney for the Shroeder bank, had brokered the deals allowing Hitler’s rise to power, assumed control over Project Paperclip and increased the fl ow of National Socialists into the United States."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"152 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Aft er former Nazi spymaster General Reinhard Gehlen met with the CIA director Dulles and off ered to turn over his extensive spy network to the CIA in exchange for non-prosecution of their Nazi pasts, the scien - tists’ dossiers were rewritten to eliminate incriminating evidence of their w ork for the Nazis. “For over forty years . . . Paperclip’s dark secrets lay safely hidden in cover-ups, lies, and deceit,” stated Hunt. Hunt uncovered documents showing that even Wernher von Braun, wh o in 1947 had been described as “a potential security threat” by the military governor, was reassessed only months later in a report stating, “he may not constitute a security threat to the U.S.” Likewise, von Braun’s brother, Magnus, who had been declared a “dangerous German Nazi” by counterintelligence offi cers, was brought to America and his pro-Nazi record expunged. “Th e eff ect of the cover-up involved far more than merely whitewash - ing the information in the dossiers,” noted Hunt. “Serious allegations of cr imes not only were expunged from the records, but were never even in - vestigated.” In a 1985 exposé in the Bullet in of the Atomic Scientists, Hunt wrote that she had examined more than 130 reports on Project Paperclip subjects—and every one “had been changed to eliminate the security threat classifi cation.” President Truman, who had explicitly ordered no committed Nazis to be admitted under Project Paperclip, was evidently never aware that his directive had been violated. Again, this is evidence of control at a level higher than the president. By the late 1940s, the now-ascendant Cold War added new impetus. P otential intelligence assets were recruited from all across Europe, many of them zealous Nazis who could be relied upon to be anticommunists. In an eff ort to avoid the negative publicity that had burdened some of the early Paperclip activities—some Americans just did not think it proper to bring former Nazis to the United States and place them in responsible positions—JIOA officers began bringing Nazis from Argentina, that haven for the Bormann or ga ni za tion.

McCloy. Th e agenda of the globalists was moving ahead. Paperclip had several spinoff p rojects. Expanding on Paperclip, the Na - tional Interest program was tightly connected to the new CIA and pro - vided a means of bypassing close scrutiny by anti-Nazi elements within m ilitary intelligence. No longer were Nazi scientists the sole objective; re - cruitment of Nazis now included Eastern Europe ans thought to be help - ful against the communists, and even convicted Nazi war criminals. A nyone, regardless of their past, was eligible as long as someone within the U.S. government deemed their presence in the national interest. Linda Hunt wrote: Prevailing myth has it that the first group in National Interest, the German scientists, were employed solely because of their scientifi c expertise, but there were other reasons as well. First, defense contrac - tors and universities could hire German scientists for substantially le ss money than they could American employees. Salary statistics show that the Germans signed contracts for approximately $2,000 a year less than their American counterparts received in comparable positions. Of course, the Germans were unaware of the salary dis - crepancy, since they had earned even less money in West Germany. Th e J IOA, however, took advantage of the situation by promoting cheap salaries to convince corporations to participate in the project. Second, because of the Joint Chiefs of Staff connection with the Na - tional Interest project, German scientists could obtain necessary se - curity clearances more easily than could American scientists.

The University of Texas, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, and Boston University were among the participants. It should be noted that Yale University, alma mater of the Bush and Harriman families and home of Skull and Bones, also received Paperclip Nazis as employees. Another program, code-named simply Project 63, was designed specifi - cally to get German scientists out of Europe and away from the Soviets. “ Most went to work for universities or defense contractors, not the U.S. government,” noted Hunt. “Th us the American taxpayer footed the bill for a project to help former Nazis obtain jobs with Lockheed, Martin Marietta, North American Aviation, and other defense contractors dur - ing a time when many American engineers in the aircraft in dustry were being laid off .” Th e P roject 63 eff ort to import Nazis grew so public—in 1952, JIOA deputy director Air Force colonel Gerold Crabbe and a gaggle of military offi cers, Paperclip members, and civilians journeyed to West Germany on a recruitment drive—that even McCloy expressed concern over a “violent reaction” by West German offi cials. West Germans complained to U.S. ambassador James Conant, demanding that Paperclip be ended. Conant appealed to then secretary of state John Foster Dulles to shut down Paper - clip “before we are faced with a formal complaint by the West German go vernment against a continuing U.S. recruitment program which has no parallel in any other Allied country.” But the project was not stopped. As usual, there was simply a name change. Paperclip became the Defense Scientists Immigration Program (DEFSIP). Conant may not have realized his appeal was aimed at one of the architects of the very program he was trying to end. As the Paperclip project began to lose momentum, yet another stimu - lus arose.

Lieutenant Colonel William Henry Whalen, who from 1957 served as deputy director of JIOA, the agency that commanded Paperclip, became the highest-ranking American ever recruited as a mole by the Soviet intelligence service. Only four months aft er he began spying for the Soviets, Whalen was promoted to the directorship of JIOA.

Whalen, who suff e red from alcoholism and debt, was recruited by the Soviets in the mid-1950s by Colonel Sergei Edemski, a loquacious Soviet military attaché in Washington, D.C. Although it became publicly known that Whalen admitted providing the Communists with our utmost se - crets concerning U.S. nuclear weaponry and strategies, his connection w ith Paperclip was not revealed. Yet, author Hunt raised a relevant ques - tion about Whalen by asking, “Did he use blackmail to recruit a spy or sabo teur from among the approximately 1,600 Paperclip specialists and hundreds of other JIOA recruits brought to this country since 1945? It certainly is clear from the evidence that many of them had a lot to hide.” Th ough charged with espionage, in 1966 Whalen made a deal with the Justice Department, in which he pled guilty to a lesser charge in exchange for his cooperation. Federal judge Oren Lewis, while accusing Whalen of “selling me and all your fellow Americans down the river,” nevertheless"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"156 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH sentenced the spy to a mere fift een years in prison. He was paroled aft er serving only six years. But it was not just homegrown spies like Whalen who were slipping i nformation out of Paperclip. Imported Nazis had every opportunity to pass national security information out of the country. According to Hunt, there was no further army surveillance over the Nazi Paperclip specialists aft er just four months of their signing a contract with the U.S. govern - ment. Furthermore, anyone receiving any more than 50 percent support f rom a Paperclip specialist constituted a “dependent,” according to their contracts. “Th e large number of so- called dependents—including mis - tresses and maids—brought to Fort Bliss [Texas] as a result of [this situa - tion] were subject to no off - the-post surveillance, even though it was assumed that they had access to at least some classifi ed information be - cause of their close contact with Paperclip personnel,” wrote Hunt. Incidents of information being passed out of Paperclip were presented t o authorities, yet nothing was done. A Fort Bliss businessman reported Paperclip engineer Hans Lindenmayr to the FBI, claiming the German had been using his business address as an illegal letter drop. According to Hunt, at least three other Nazis maintained illegal mail drops in El Paso, “where they received money from foreign or unknown sources and coded messages from South America.” It was also learned that many Paperclip Nazis received cash from foreign sources. “Neither Army CIC not FBI agents knew where that money came from, and by all appearances, no one cared to know how more than a third of the Paperclip group suddenly were able to buy expensive cars,” noted Hunt. When word was passed that Nazi scientists working for the French were sus pected of receiving orders from Germany to work toward a reemergence of the Reich, army intelligence offi cers fi nally began to take a closer look at Paperclip. Amazingly, the biggest catch was Wernher von Braun. It was re - vealed that at the end of the war, the rocket scientist had been caught send - ing a map overseas to General Dornberger and concealing information from U. S. offi c ials. Further investigation revealed that Paperclip specialists were allowed to make unsupervised trips off base and even out of town, the on ly requirement being that they report when they arrived at their destination. Several had their own telephones that were never monitored."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"PROJECT PAPERCLIP AND THE SPACE RACE 157 President Truman was once notifi ed by the CIA that the Nazi scien - tists working for the Soviets were using a postal address in the U.S. sector o f West Germany as a cover for communications with the Paperclip scien - tists in America. One General Electric manager working with Paperclip s pecialists told the FBI that the Army’s lax security at White Sands Prov - ing Grounds bordered on “criminal neglect,” especially since about 350 of t he Germans’ former coworkers were serving the Rus sians. He believed that it was reasonable to assume that friendly contacts between the two groups still existed. Apparently, overseas communication between the Nazis in America a nd the Nazis in Rus sia continued unabated, which has raised the possibil - ity of a parallel space race controlled or manipulated by the very globalists wh o had created and financed both communism and the Th ird Reich.

What may be even more diffi cult is to consider that the space race was never a true competition between the United States and the former Soviet Union; rather, it was a combined space program run by Nazi scientists and controlled by high-level glo - balists. As the Allies closed in on Nazi Germany in the spring of 1945, top A merican commanders were given orders to leave all the rockets and their plans at the Nazi facility at Nordhausen for the Russians.

According to Linda Hunt, James Webb, NASA administra - tor during the Kennedy years, complained that the Nazi scientists were ci rcumventing the system to the extent of attempting to build their own Saturn V rocket in-house at the Marshall Center. “. . . the Germans dominated the rocket program to such an extent that t hey held the chief and deputy slots of every major division and labora - tory. And their positions at Marshall and the Kennedy Space Center at C ape Canaveral, Florida, were similar to those they had held during the war,” wrote Hunt. “Th e Peenemunde team’s leader, Wernher von Braun, became the first director of the Marshall Space Center; Mittlewerk’s head of production, Arthur Rudolph, was named project director of the Saturn V rocket program; Peenemunde’s V-2 flight test director, Kurt Debus, was the first director of the Kennedy Space Center.” Rudolph, who gained American citizenship aft e r entering the USA with his boss von Braun under the program that was to become Paperclip, was credited with helping to place Americans on the moon. He retired with a NASA pension in 1979 but was stripped of his American citizen - ship in 1983, aft e r he conceded to the Justice Department that he had “participated under the direction of and on behalf of the Nazi govern - ment of Germany, in the persecution of unarmed civilians because of t heir race, religion, national origin, or political opinion.” However, a West German investigation of Rudolph stated there was no factual basis for charging him with war crimes and granted him German citizenship. Sev - eral Americans, including Lieutenant Colonel William E. Winterstein S r., who was commander of the Technical Service Unit at Fort Bliss, Texas, which supported the German scientists, claimed Rudolph was rail - roaded by the Justice Department’s Offi c e of Special Investigations, some members of which “had the full cooperation of the Soviet Union; there - fore, close coordination with the KGB.” A S RECE N T LY RE L E A SE D files from behind the Iron Curtain have re - vealed, many of the scientists in Paperclip as well as some on the Manhat - tan Project indeed were spying for the Soviet Union. Th e ir motivations"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"PROJECT PAPERCLIP AND THE SPACE RACE 159 were many. Some spied for pay, some for ideology, but all were manipu - lated by intelligence chiefs far above them. Th e fl ow of information between the scientists in the Soviet Union and the United States has led some researchers to suspect that a covert space program—a third program—was in eff ect. Joseph P. Farrell, who holds a doctorate degree in patristics (the study of early Christian writers and their work) from the University of Oxford, also has researched ancient history and physics, to include the space program. In his 2004 book Reich of the Black Sun, Farrell wrote, “[I]t is perhaps signifi cant that some contemporary observers of the American space program and its odd thirty-year-long ‘hold - ing pattern’ and tapestry of inconsistencies, lies and obfuscations have long sus pected that there are indeed two space programs inside the U.S. govern - ment, the public NASA one, and a quasi-independent one based deep w ithin covert and black projects.” Th is i dea is somewhat supported by the fact that the space programs of Rus sia and America moved along diff erent paths. At the start, the Rus - sians proved more capable of attaining space flight than the Americans. U nder the leadership of their brilliant engineer Sergei Korolev, the Rus- sians produced giant heavy-lift r ockets while their American counterparts were busy developing the internal technology for guidance and control. Th e S oviet Rus sians were first to launch a satellite, Sputnik, into Earth’s orbit (1957); to orbit a man, Colonel Yuri Gagarin, and return him safely (1961); to place a live animal, the dog Laika (1957), and Valentina Ter - eshkova, the first woman into orbit (1963); to land unmanned vehicles on t he moon (1970); to conduct an extravehicular “space walk” by cosmo - nauts; and to place nuclear warheads on Intercontinental Ballistic Mis - siles (ICBM). Both nations used captured Nazi V-2 rockets to begin their space pro - grams. A common joke in the 1950s involved an argument between a R ussian and an American. “Our German scientists are better than your German scientists,” they shouted at each other. Yet, the evidence indicates that the American rocket scientists were i ndeed placed into a holding pattern while their Soviet counterparts caught up with their technology. William E. Winterstein Sr., a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel and one of the rocket engineers on NASA’s"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"160 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Apollo team, noted in his 2002 book Gestapo USA, “Th e space history of this country reveals that during the 1950s, the von Braun team had devel - oped a multistage rocket by adding solid propellant rocket stages to a R edstone rocket as booster. In 1956, such a rocket with two solid stages made successful high- speed rocket reentry tests with model warheads cov - ered with ablative heat protection. With three solid stages, such a rocket c ould have placed a satellite into orbit more than a year before the U.S. was defeated by Sputnik . However, and almost unbelievably, the von Braun team was given direct orders from Washington to stop further de- velopment. Th e t eam was restricted to the development of rockets whose range was less than 200 miles. It was only aft er President Kennedy an - nounced the lunar mission in 1961 that the German rocket team was fi - nally released from agonizing bureaucratic blunders from Washington, a nd was given a free hand, and even orders, to accomplish von Braun’s lifelong goal to travel into space.” It has been argued that a primary incentive of the German scientists was t he sheer desire to continue their work. “Some of these would stop at noth - ing, even resorting to duping their colleagues and superiors in order to en - sure the continuance of their research,” commented British authors Mary B ennett and David S. Percy. However, in some cases, such as that of von Braun, the connection between the work and the Nazis was close and con - tinuous. Von Braun, the son of a well- connected Prus sian minister who fo unded the German Savings Bank, was brought into Germany’s rocket program by Luft waff e general Walter Dornberger, who, although charged as a war criminal for the rocket attacks on London and Antwerp, was never brought to trial. Instead, he came into the United States as part of Project Paperclip. Likewise, von Braun, revered as the father of the U.S. space pro - gram, was found to have been a Nazi Party member, a member of the SS w ith the rank of major, a friend to SS Reichsfuehrer Heinrich Himmler, and, according to Linda Hunt, was accused by survivors of the rocket facto - ries at Mittlewerk and Peenemunde of at least once ordering the execution o f slave laborers. Kurt Debus, who became the first director of the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, was both a member of the Nazi SS and the SA. According to documents obtained by Hunt, in 1942 Debus turned a colleague over to the Gestapo for making anti-Hitler remarks."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"PROJECT PAPERCLIP AND THE SPACE RACE 161 Th e Soviet manner of dealing with their Nazi scientists greatly diff ered from the laxity of Project Paperclip. “With hindsight, it would seem that the Soviets demonstrated a more humanitarian approach toward their technical prisoners than did the Americans,” noted Bennett and Percy. “Moreover, the way in which the technical information was passed from teacher to pupil was very diff erent. Th e Soviet experts and the Germans worked side by side in the same factory, but in separate areas. Information was passed between these teams without the Germans ever meeting their Soviet counterparts. Th ey only spoke directly to Korolev, who was far curter with them than he had been in Bleicherode [the V-2 test area in Germany’s Harz Mountains, where Korolev had first debriefed the scien - tists at war’s end].” Some serious researchers have opined that the space programs of both t he USSR and the USA, despite the political posturing, were actually the same program, one far ahead of the current joint Rus sian-American space efforts such as the International Space Station. “Th is [overall] project was conceived and designed as a collaboration between two superpowers,” wrote Bennett and Percy. “Th e Cold War was a convenient cover under which aspects of this program could be implemented and hidden. All these machinations were orchestrated at the very highest level, with only a select and hidden few ever knowing the overall objectives of the project [emphasis in original].” As noted by Farrell, “Th is , of course, implies some entity or agency of coordination existing both within the Soviet Union and the United States.” If this were so, who were these hidden manipulators? To begin with, there were the German rocket scientists themselves. In 1 945, Lieutenant Walter Jessel was assigned to investigate how much trust to give the scientists before bringing them to America. According to au - thor Hunt, the lieutenant “uncovered evidence of a conspiracy among von B raun, Dornberger, and Dornberger’s former chief of staff , Herbert Ax - ster, to withhold information from U.S. offi c ers.” Secret codicils within the 1945 Yalta Agreement between Roo sevelt, C hurchill, and Stalin allowed for the partitioning of Europe between the Allied powers. Dr. Wilhelm Voss, the former head of the Skoda Munitions Works in"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"162 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Pilsen, had handled much of the material for Kammler’s Kammlerstab Special Projects Group. In May 1945, when elements of the American Army arrived in the Czech city of Pilsen, Voss attempted to hand over a truckload of Kammlerstab documents but was told by the commanding U. S. offi ce r that he was under orders to give everything to the Rus sians. While entire German divisions were trying desperately to surrender t o the Western Allies, it is well known that Patton’s Th ird Army had reached the outskirts of Berlin before being ordered back a hundred miles to await the arrival of the Rus sians, who were required to fight des - perately for every block of the city. Such a withdrawal is clear evidence of t he deals being made at the highest levels. As has been noted, there was communication between the two groups o f Nazi scientists even though they were half a world away from each other. Th is could have been facilitated by the interconnected business and banking interests already described. As detailed in the section “Communism versus National Socialism” t he same Western bankers and financiers who funded Hitler’s National Socialism also supported Communism in Rus sia. Th e U.S. federal gov- ernment’s leniency toward communism has been well documented, be - ginning with President Franklin D. Roo sevelt, who began his career as a W all Street attorney specializing in corporate law. Roosevelt echoed his Wall Street cronies’ warm regard for both Stalin and communism. Ac - cording to historian Th o mas Fleming, the U.S. government was rife with globalist agents conveying secrets back to Rus sia. “Th ere was scarcely a branch of the American government, including the War, Navy, and Jus- tice Departments, that did not have Soviet moles in high places, feeding M oscow information. [William] Wild Bill Donovan’s Offi ce of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the CIA, had so many informers in its ranks, it was almost an arm of the NKVD. Donovan’s personal assistant, Duncan Chaplin Lee, was a spy,” Fleming wrote. Another possible crossing point for aerospace information may have bee n the British Interplanetary Society (BIS), according to Bennett and Percy. While the BIS was reportedly created in September 1945 by com - bining several existing organizations interested in the future of space ex ploration, it was not offi cially inaugurated until December of that year."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"PROJECT PAPERCLIP AND THE SPACE RACE 163 At that time, Wernher von Braun, the man behind the V-2 rockets, was named as an honorary fellow. Arthur C. Clarke, an early member of the BIS, claimed the society had been in existence long before the war and was merely in “suspended animation” from 1939 to 1945. Noting that the Soviet embassy in London subscribed to no less than t wenty copies of the bimonthly BIS journal, Bennett and Percy asked, “Why was it necessary to reform a society already in existence? Why did the British hasten to grant such an award to the man who only nine months before [as technical director of the Nazi V-1 and V-2 rocket programs], was responsible for the annihilation of so many people in London and the Home Counties? Why did both the British (and von Braun) wish to play down the real timing, if everybody felt comfortable with the reasons for honoring [von Braun]?” Th eir insinuation is that valuable rocket technol - ogy information was passed along via the BIS, possibly with the approval o f von Braun. President Eisen hower , aware of the American public’s concern that the Soviets might be winning the space race, ordered a Manhattan Project approach to the problem. Th is mandate resulted in a structure that be - came compartmentalized and shrouded with secrecy. All relevant infor - mation was on a strictly “need to know” basis, controlled by members of t he self-styled globalist elite, the plutocrats who owned the emerging mul - tinational corporations. To fully understand how this control over parallel space programs w orked, one must look past the Eisenhower administration and study the National Security Act of 1947. On September 15 of that year—only three months aft er pilot Kenneth Arnold saw fl ying discs over Mount Rainier, and just two months aft er something crashed near Roswell, New Mexico—President Harry S. Tru - man signed into law the National Security Act of 1947, which, among other t hings, created the National Security Council (NSC) and the Air Force as a separate branch of service, united the military branches under a Depart - ment of Defense, and created America’s fi rst pea cetime civilian intelligence or ga ni za tion, the Central Intelligence Agency. An important example of the tight inner government control by secret soci ety members may be found in the NSC, which has come to dominate"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"164 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH U.S. policy decisions, including the use of armed force. Most Americans ha ve no idea who exactly comprises the powerful NSC. Th e council prin - cipals are the president, vice president, and secretaries of state and defense, pos itions predominantly held throughout the later twentieth century by members of the globalist societies, the Council on Foreign Relations, or the Trilateral Commission. Th e NSC staff is directed by the president’s national security adviser. To coordinate covert operations, the NSC cre - ated the 5412 Committee, also called the Special Group, which has cha nged names several times to avoid public exposure. In 1964, it was known as the 303 Committee and in 1970 it was renamed the 40 Com - mittee. Within this organizat ion— which included such familiar names as Nelson Rockefeller, Robert McNamara, McGeorge Bundy, Gordon Gray, and Allen Dulles—was a subcommittee dealing with science and technology. It is here that the connection between the corporate and fi - nancial world and government-held technological secrets may be found. H ere is centered control over rocketry, space, alternative energy sources, and even UFOs. And it is here that researchers have tracked the mysteri - ous group known as Majic Twelve, later known as Majestic Twelve or si mply MJ- 12. Th e MJ-12 issue was first publicly raised in 1984 when a TV producer and UFO researcher received an undeveloped roll of 35-mm black- and-white film in his mail. Th e film contained eight pages of what ap - peared to be offi c ial U.S. government documents stamped TOP SECR ET/ MAJIC EYES ONLY and dated November 18, 1952. Th e pages were a “brief - ing document” prepared for president-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower, con - cerning “Operation Majestic 12.” Th e re has been ongoing controversy over the legitimacy of these and the subsequent release of other MJ-12 documents, including a Standard Operations Manual (SOM 1-01) marked “Top Secret/MAJIC,” dated April 1954, and titled “Extraterrestrial Enti - ties and Technology, Recovery and Disposal.” Th e d ocuments listed twelve prominent men as members of Operation Majestic 12, “a TOP SECRET Research and Development/Intelligence operation responsible directly and only to the President of the United States,” who were to deal with the UFO issue at the highest level.

Th e document added, “Civilian and military witnesses in the area were debriefed, and news reporters were given the eff ective cover story that the object had been a misguided weather research balloon.” Later, when the weather balloon story became discredited, the story was changed to a Mogul balloon, used to monitor the upper atmosphere for Soviet A-bomb testing, though why such a monitoring device would be launched from New Mexico was never explained. Th e “ briefing” papers ended by stating, “Implications for the National Security are of continuing importance in that the motives and ultimate intentions of these visitors remain completely unknown. In addition, a signifi cant upsurge in the surveillance activity of these craft beginning in May and continuing through the autumn of [1952] has caused considera - ble concern that new developments may be imminent. It is for these rea - sons, as well as the obvious international and technological considerations a nd the ultimate need to avoid a public panic at all costs, that the Majestic-12 Group remains of the unanimous opinion that imposition of the strictest security precautions should continue without interruption into the new administration.” Th ese MJ-12 documents created a storm of controversy within the UFO research community. Debunkers claimed to have found all sorts of discrepancies—from misspellings to identical signatures. However, no one has been able to definitively disprove all the MJ-12 documents as fakes and, in fact, there is much evidence to indicate their authenticity. For example, Dr. Robert M. Wood, who managed research and develop - ment at McDonnell Douglas for forty-three years, found that the typeface a nd style of the SOM 1-01 manual matched that of U.S. government printing presses in use during the 1950s. If the information in the MJ-12 documents is proven correct, it is str ong evidence that certain persons within the United States had access to remarkable technology, both taken at Roswell and similar to that de - scribed as being in Nazi hands toward the end of the war."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"166 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH A cursory look at the men identifi ed as the original MJ-12 group, as well as their corporate and intelligence connections, makes clear the po - tential for high-level control over exotic technology—groundbreaking t echnology that could upset the monopolies over energy, transportation, and communications held by the wealthy globalists who financed Hitler. As listed in the documents, MJ-12 members included: ◆ Adminstrator Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, a 1919 g ra duate of the Naval Academy, who was familiar with both intelligence work and the Nazis, having worked undercover for a year in Vichy, France. A ft er serving as the third director of Central Intelli - gence Group, he became the first director of the CIA upon its fo rmation in September 1947, obviously a good choice for a top- secret group like MJ- 12.

Dr. Bush was another prime candidate for a high-level group dealing with space. He also was a close friend to Averell Harriman, the U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union, who had ownership in Union Banking Cor - poration along with Prescott Bush. (It is reported that Vannevar Bus h was unrelated to the political Bush family.) In 1949, the U.S. Intelligence Board asked Bush to study ways of combining i ntelligence from all agencies. Bush’s plan was initiated by Amer- ica’s first secretary of defense, James V. Forrestal, who also is listed as an MJ-12 member. Bush’s connections to the corporate world were deep and many. In 1922, Bush, along with his former room - mate Laurence K. Marshall and scientist Charles G. Smith,"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"PROJECT PAPERCLIP AND THE SPACE RACE 167 formed American Appliance Company, today known as the pow - erful Raytheon Corporation heralded in its company literature as a n “industry leader in defense and government electronics, space, information technology, technical services and business aviation and special mission aircraft .” Bush joined the Massachusetts In - stitute of Technology (MIT) as a professor in 1919, a nd i n 1936 w as awarded a major grant by the Rocke feller Foundation. His work during World War II resulted in the development of the Rocke fel ler Diff erential Analyzer, an analog mainframe compu - ter composed of 2,000 vacuum tubes and 150 motors. Bush also se rved on the board of directors of the Metals and Controls Cor - poration, which in 1959 merged with Texas Instruments to be - come the first U.S. government–approved fabricator of uranium r ods. Bush also was a presence in the corporate world of pharma - ceuticals, eventually becoming chairman of the board of Merck a nd Company, one of the world’s most powerful drug companies. Merck has been among the leaders in researching the human ge - nome, the DNA structure that forms cells into humans. Bush a lso was connected to the Carnegie wealth, serving as president of the Carnegie Institute from 1935 to 1955. ◆ James V. Forrestal, who, prior to World War I, was a bond salesman for William A. Read and Company, later to become Dil - lon, Read and Company. Aft e r the war, he returned to Read and Company and by 1937 was named president. Th is was at a time when Dillon and Read were the most profi table of all Wall Street syndicate managers handling German industrial issues in the U.S. capital market. In 1957, Fortune ma gazine named Clarence Dillon as one of the wealthiest men in America, with a fortune estimated to have been between $150 and $200 million. Russell A. Nixon, the young attorney for the U.S. Military Government Ca rtel Unit who tried to break up the Nazi corporate syndicates at the end of the war, was blocked in his efforts by Brigadier Gen - eral William H. Draper, who along with Forrestal was an offi c er of Dillon and Read. According to Sutton, “Banker William"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"168 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Draper, as Brigadier General William Draper, put his control team together from businessmen who had represented American business in prewar Germany.” Forrestal also sat on the board of General Aniline and Film (GAF), a subsidiary of I. G. Farben with 91.5 percent ownership by the brother-in-law of Farben chairman Hermann Schmitz. Heading GAF was Rudolf Ilgner, who near the outbreak of war off ered the U.S. Army Agfa film at a low price for photographing the Panama Canal and other de - fense installations. “Ilgner has a sense of humor,” noted Charles H igham, the New York Times writer who traced the Nazi- American money plot in his 1983 book Trading with the Enemy. “He gave the American government copies of the movies and still photographs and kept the originals, which were shipped via the Hamburg-Amerika steamship line [partly owned by Pres- cott Bush]. Th e p resident of this company was Julius P. Meyer, head of the Board of Trade for German-American Commerce, whose chairman was—Rudolf Ilgner.” Forrestal became secretary of defense in July 1947—the time of the Roswell incident—but resigned in March 1949, a month before he reportedly commit - ted suicide at Bethesda Naval Hospital. He claimed he was being fo llowed by Zionist agents. His MJ-12 position was permanently filled by General Walter B. Smith. ◆ General Walter Bedell Smith, who had been Eisenhower’s chief of staff and former U.S. ambassador to Moscow, replacing Averell Harriman. In 1950, Smith replaced Admiral Hillenkoetter as Director of Central Intelligence. Most intriguing was Smith’s close relationship as friend and business partner with Prince Bern- hard of the Netherlands, the former SS offi cer who, with Smith’s help, founded the secretive Bilderberg Group. Before leaving for En gland prior to hostilities, the German-born Bernhard was em - ployed in I. G. Farben’s Intelligence Department, NM7. ◆ General Nathan F.

He had canceled a scheduled trip on July 8, 1947, “due to a very important and sudden matter.” Th is was the day the Roswell Air Base press re - lease regarding the recovery of a fl y ing saucer was issued. UFO researcher William Moore claimed that Twining actually made a two-day trip to New Mexico. On September 23, 1945, just as the air force became a separate service, Twining sent a letter to the chief of staff of the Army Air Force, Brigadier General George Schulgen, who had requested information on “fl ying discs.” In a letter stamped SECR ET , Twining began by stating without equivo - cation, “Th e p henomenon reported is something real and not vi - sionary or fi cti tious.” He recommended that a permanent group be established to study UFOs. ◆ General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, a West Point graduate and mil - itary man, who served as U.S. Air Force chief of staff an d Di - rector of Central Intelligence. As a named MJ-12 member, V anderberg did not appear to have solid Wall Street connections. However, he was a cl ose relative to the powerful U.S. senator Arthur Vandenberg, who served as president pro tempore of the Senate, third in line of succession to the presidency, and chaired the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

They were also all dead at the time the MJ-12 papers surfaced, thus unable to answer any questions about their role, if any, in such a group. Th e a genda of this control group may have been best expressed by Sena - tor Lyndon B. Johnson who, speaking to the Senate Democratic Caucus o n January 7, 1958, stated, “Control of space means control of the world . . . . From space, the masters of infinity would have the power to control the E arth’s weather, to cause drought and fl ood, to change the tides and raise the levels of the sea, to divert the Gulf Stream and change the climate to frigid . . . . Th e re is something more powerful than the ultimate weapon. Th at is the ultimate position—the position of total control over the Earth that lies somewhere in outer space . . . . And if there is an ultimate position, t hen our national goal and the goal of all free men must be to win and hold that position.” Johnson, who in 1954 became the youngest Senate majority leader in U.S. history, was in a position to serve those in both the military and the corporations. In 2007, President George W. Bush echoed Johnson’s remarks by calling for new space missions and the weaponiza - tion of space. A DDI NG TO J OH NSON’S puzzling statement about “the masters of infin - ity” are facts indicating an astounding connection between the well- d ocumented occultism of the Nazis, the NASA space program, and the Soviet space program. Richard C. Hoagland, a former science adviser to Walter Cronkite and CB S News during the Apollo program, astounded conspiracy researchers in the 1990s with his assertion that the time and date of many NASA space launches, including the Apollo moon missions, were set to coincide with astrological alignments of the stars and planets. In 1992, Hoagland briefed UN offi cials on the mathematical and geometric linkage connect - ing the siting of “Cydonia” on Mars, the location of the Martian “Pyra - mids” and “Face,” with the Egyptian location of the pyramids and sphinx o n Earth. “Th i s remarkable new evidence that ‘all is not as we have thought re - garding NASA’ is distinctly diff e rent from the offi cial NASA imagery"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"174 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH that [I have] been analyzing for almost fift een years,” reported Hoagland. “Th is new evidence is of a ‘pattern’ [shown by] an offi cial, undeniable log of NASA mission planning, mission priorities, and space agency decisions extending back to when the agency was offi cially formed by Act of Con - gress on July 29, 1958. Th is l og has been carefully compiled from recorded network mission broadcasts from, among others, ‘my’ old network—CBS; offi cially published NASA mission time lines; and documented testimo - nials of former NASA scientists.” According to Hoagland, these cross- correlated public records now pro - vide firm evidence of an astonishing, offi cia l link between NASA’s sup - posedly strictly “scientifi c ” missions and millennia-old occult beliefs. In fact, the original offi cial NASA Apollo Lunar Program logo of the 1960s clearly depicted the “belt” in the constellation of Orion, long thought to represent Osiris, a central fi gure in Egyptian celestial mythology. “Curi - ously, immediately aft er the Apollo 13 ‘accident,’ NASA quietly changed this offi cial Apollo program logo—adding random stars to the existing constellation, thereby cleverly obscuring its direct derivation from Orion,” noted Hoagland. He concluded that the extraordinarily complex and expensive m ission-planning for the entire Apollo Lunar Program, far from being merely “represented” by this “interesting” Egyptian mythological con - nection, was in fact completely controlled by, and designed around, this cr ucial Orion symbolism. In other words, someone with enough author - ity to set the launch date and time for an Apollo space mission, as well as ma ny others, was guided by the astrological alignment of the stars and planets rather than an objective scientific basis. Th is occult aspect has been kept carefully hidden not only from the American taxpayers, who paid for these missions, but from the vast majority of NASA personnel as well. “[I]magine the astonishment that you would feel if you learned that Apoll o 11 ’s historic lunar touchdown . . . took place at the one location on the entire lunar surface—Tranquillity—and within minutes out of an entire solar year (8:17 P. M . GMT, July 20, 1969), where and when Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, and the central stellar fi gure, Isis, in the Egyp - tian triumvirate of Isis, Osiris, and Horus, could have been seen hovering"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"PROJECT PAPERCLIP AND THE SPACE RACE 175 above the airless Eastern horizon—precisely at 19.5 degrees elevation!” said Hoagland. Yet, this is exactly what happened. Mary Ann Weaver, a former Boeing engineer and computer profes- sional, was intrigued by the data produced by Hoagland and his associate M ichael Bara. As a former researcher with the antenna division of Boeing, she was experienced in 3-D computer modeling, computational analysis, and developing equations and analytic methods for problem-solving. Weaver set out to confirm or deny the findings of Hoagland and Bara. Aft e r a careful study of their data, Weaver concluded that the star alignments for the mission activities and launches did not happen by ac - cident. “[T]hey must happen by design,” she stated. “To try and explain t hem via random pro cesses results in odds of billions to one. I would not bet on the ‘random’ side of these kind of odds.” “Th e signifi cance of these findings is [that] I have shown there to be a pattern throughout eighty- two launches that were part of the Apollo preparation phase—and Apollo itself. Additionally, I have shown that the Apollo missions follow this same pattern on a day-to- day, mission- activities level, which is even more improbable because of its consistency with the launch data. Furthermore, it is improbable that the frequency of these stellar alignments are [ sic ] tied to weather or lighting conditions, because of the fact that they occur for a variety of mission events, even those that do not require specifi c lighting or weather conditions,” she concluded. Michael Bara pointed to a disturbing similarity with Rus sian space fl ights. He noticed that the launch of the first module for the new Inter - national Space Station was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome l ocated in Kazakhstan, now an independent nation that borders Rus sia and the Caspian Sea, and was apparently designed to coincide with a number of the signifi cant celestial alignments already found in NASA’s long-established ritual pattern. Th is would indicate some connection be - tween the former Soviet space program and NASA, perhaps through the N azi scientists working in both. Aft e r studying the August 1998 mission, Bara noted, “[Th e module] Zarya, which translates into ‘sunrise’ or ‘rising sun’ in En glish, was launched from pad 333 at its precisely scheduled time despite Rus sian"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"176 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH requests to have the launch delayed. NASA, citing a number of minor technical considerations, refused the Rus sian request and the launch went off as originally scheduled and was witnessed by NASA administrator Dan Goldin.

Only when you consider the symbolic signifi ca nce of the moment does this steadfast insistence make sense.” It is not necessary for one to believe in astrology. Th e point is that someone high enough in power in the U.S. government—and, apparently, in Russia—to be able to order the dates and times of space missions does believe in such things. Is this evi - dence of Nazi occultism in our space program? President John F. Kennedy may have been aware of a parallel space pro - gram and decided to make it public policy. On November 12, 1963, ten d ays before his assassination, he instructed NASA administrator James Webb to develop a program of “ joint space and lunar exploration” with the Soviet Union. Th is proposal, which may startle Americans today, was verifi ed by Sergei Khruschev, the eldest son of the former Russian pre - mier, in 1997. Th e i mportance of Kennedy’s step toward reconciliation with the Soviet Union and his control over NASA will become apparent in the upcoming chapter, “Kennedy and the Nazis.” Who would have wanted to stop joint U.S-Soviet space missions that m ight have ended the Cold War in the early 1960s? And who has been orchestrating the launches of space missions in both the United States and Rus sia with an eye toward occult astrological alignments? Does this mean that someone with the power to set space mission launches in both nations truly believes in the power of the position of the stars? And whom did Johnson mean by the “masters of infinity”? Strong evidence suggests they may well be the subject of this boo k—those global National Socialists and their minions, who have a goal of controlling the entire world.

Since prior to the twentieth century, Germans had delved into psychology and psychiatry with an eye toward their application to warfare, even to the extent of exploring occult prac - tices. As well documented in a number of books, articles, and videos, t here was a very definite and underlying occult aspect to National Social - ism. As elucidated in R ule by Secrecy, Unholy Alliance, Th e Occult and the Th ird Reich, Th e Spear of Destiny, and other works, World War II was largely the result of infi ghting between secret occult societies composed of wealthy businessmen on both sides of the Atlantic. Eventually the ten - sions between these groups provoked open warfare that consumed the en tire world. Sir Winston Churchill “was insistent that the occultism of the Nazi P arty should not under any circumstances be revealed to the general pub - lic,” stated author Trevor Ravenscroft , wh o wrote that he worked closely with Dr. Walter Johannes Stein, a confidential adviser to Churchill. “Th e failure of the Nuremberg trials to identify the nature of the evil at work behind the outer facade of National Socialism convinced him that an - other three decades must pass before a large enough readership would be"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"NAZI MIND CONTROL 179 present to comprehend the initiation rites and black-magic practices of the inner core of Nazi leadership.” Th is r emarkable statement was corroborated by Airey Neave, one of the Nuremberg prosecutors, who said the occult aspect of the Nazis was ruled inadmissible because the tribunal thought that such beliefs, so con - trary to Western public rationalism, might allow Nazi leaders to go free by pleading insanity. Even Hitler acknowledged that Nazi ideology ventured into a spiritual r ealm, when he stated, “Anyone who interprets National Socialism merely as a political movement knows almost nothing about it. It is more than religion; it is the determination to create a new man.” To attempt this creation, the Nazis turned to occultists such as Baron R udolf Freiherr von Sebottendorff , Jorg Lanz von Liebenfels, Guido von List, Dietrich Eckart, and Karl Haushofer, all of whom had immersed themselves in the philosophies of the Th eosophical Society. Th eosophy, derived from the Greek theos (god) and sophia (wisdom), was an attempt to blend Christianity with Cabalistic and Eastern mysticism. One tenet of theosophy was that “Great Masters,” sometimes called the “Great White Brotherhood,” are secretly directing humankind’s evolution. “Th e r ationale behind many later Nazi projects can be traced back . . . to ideas first popularized by [Th eosophical Society found er Helen] Bla - vatsky,” wrote Peter Levenda, who detailed connections with other Euro - pe an secret organizations, such as the Ordo Templi Orientis, or Oriental T emplars (OTO), Dr. Rudolf Steiner’s Anthroposophical Society, and the Order of the Golden Dawn. Such groups were “concerned with raising their consciousness by means o f rituals to an awareness of evil and non-human Intelligences in the Uni - verse and with achieving a means of communication with these Intelli - gences. And the Master-Adept of this circle was Dietrich Eckart [the man H itler called “spiritual founder of National Socialism”],” noted Ravens- croft . Hitler wrote of his own occult experiences as a soldier in World Wa r I : “ I o ft en go on bitter nights, to Wotan’s oak in the quiet glade, with dark powers to weave a union.” As previously mentioned, the deeply occulted Ge rmanenorden contrived"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"180 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH the Th ule Society as a cover organization. “Th e original conception of the modern Th ulists was extremely crude and naive,” Ravenscroft explained. “Th e more sophisticated versions of the legend of Th ule only gradually developed in the hands of Dietrich Eckart and General Karl Haushofer, and were later refined and extended under the direction of Reichsfuehrer SS Heinrich Himmler, who terrorized a large section of the German aca - demic world into lending a professional hand at perpetuating the myth of G erman racial superiority.” In light of the occultism apparent in modern space missions mentioned ea rlier, recall that General Karl Haushofer, who used astrology to provoke the strange fl ight of Rudolf Hess to En gland, was a member of the myste - rious Vril, an occult society that practiced telepathy and telekinesis. It is surmised that it was perhaps through such occult practices that ps ychic contact was made with nonhuman intelligences, thus providing the Nazis with the concepts that led to their futuristic technology. Nazi occult researcher Nicholas Goodrick- Clarke, in his 1992 book Th e Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Th eir Influence on Nazi Ideology, wrote that the power that motivated the occultists surrounding Hitler and Himmler “is characterized either as a discarnate entity (e.g., ‘black forces,’ ‘invisible hierarchies,’ ‘unknown superiors’), or as a magical elite in a remote age or distant location, with which the Nazis were in contact.” Although rumors have fl oa ted about for years that the Nazis captured a UFO, no credible evidence has ever been produced. Some of those who have studied this issue have come to suspect that any such knowledge of nonhuman technology may instead have come through Nazi occultists using psychic means similar to remote viewing, a psychic ability studied, taught, and used operationally by the U.S. Army, the CIA, and the Na - tional Security Agency beginning in the early 1970s. It was Soviet interest i n psychic experimentation that led to experiments in the United States and the eventual creation of a unit of psychic spies within the U.S. Army. Remote viewing, known in parapsychological terms as clairvoyance, is the ability to discern persons, places, and things at a distance by means other than the normal fi ve senses. According to former U.S. military intelligence agent Lyn Buchanan, wh o at one time trained the U.S. Army’s remote viewers, the Nazis formed"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"NAZI MIND CONTROL 181 a unit of psychics and called it Doktor Gruenbaum. Th is name was for the psychic project, not a person, although apparently a German psychic who assumed the name Gruenbaum may have lived in the United States aft er the war. Th e name Gruenbaum, or green tree, apparently was a reference to the green-tree symbol in the Cabala, which relates to the “tree of knowl - edge” in the Garden of Eden. Buchanan reported: “When Adolf Hitler lost the war and the victors beg an to divide the spoils, the U.S. and other countries dividing up the nuclear and rocket scientists had little or no concern for the mystical re - search. Rus sia, however, did, and so they took the scientists from the ‘Do ktor Gruenbaum’ project back to Rus sia.” Interestingly enough, it was reported that the Nazi Doktor Gruenbaum unit was connected to a broader program called Majik. Th is name has prompted comparisons to America’s original UFO-secrecy group, Majic Twelve. Could it be that psychic viewing by the Nazi Doktor Gruenbaum unit ti pped off Hitler to the possible pending secret attack on Europe from the Soviet Union, resulting in his preemptive Barbarossa attack? Since this ability is intuitive and not always crystal-clear, German viewers may have perceived the buildup of Soviet forces but been unable to foresee the end result of Barbarossa—the eventual defeat of Germany. Whether or not the Nazis used psychic mental abilities to acquire ex - otic technolog y, it is beyond question that the study of the human mind beg an in earnest in Germany, with far-reaching consequences. Behind the horrors of the Nazi regime rested a foundation of Europe an st udy of the human mind. Justifi cation of euthanasia and extermination programs was provided by some of Germany’s most learned men. “Hitler’s philosophy and his concept of man in general was shaped to a decisive degree by psychiatry. . . . an infl u ential cluster of psychiatrists and their frightening theories and methods collectively form the missing piece of the puzzle of Hitler, the Th ird Reich, the atrocities and their dreadful legacy. It is the overlooked yet utterly central piece of the puzzle,” wrote Dr. Th omas Roeder and his coauthors Volker Kubillus and Anthony Bur- well in their 1995 book Psychiatrists — the Men Behind Hitler.

Th e r esult was a strange, incongru - ous marriage of Darwin’s observations of the animal world with Malthus’s e motional assumptions about the uncontrollable population growth and social solutions to preserve the British aristocracy,” noted Roeder, Kubil - lus, and Burwell. Th e y added that social Darwinism was perhaps the Nazis’ most central theoretical foundation. “Social Darwinism had a profound and long-lasting eff ect o n the mind of Adolf Hitler,” agreed Professor Snyder. “He expressed its ideas in sim - plifi ed fo rm in the pages of Mein Kampf . . . and he made it the theme of most of his major speeches.” From the viewpoint that certain people are more evolved and thus more c ompetent to judge others came the profession of psychiatry. Th e term it - self came from the Greek psyche, o r soul, and iatros, or doctor. However, these doctors of the soul quickly became preoccupied with more material matters—the physical brain and how to manipulate or destroy it. As the fi el d of psychiatry grew, so did its definitions. In 1871, “Th e Psychical Degeneration of the French People” was published, a paper that left the impression that simply being French constituted a mental illness. “One of psychiatry’s leading figures, Richard von Krafft -Ebing, added to his list of varieties of mental disorders ‘political and reformatory insanity’—meaning any inclination to form a diff erent opinion from that of the masses,” the trio of researchers stated."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"NAZI MIND CONTROL 183 At the time of World War I, the attempt to bring respectability to the emerging psychiatric profession resulted in a certain bonding between psychiatry and the aristocratic German government. The German mili - tary was particularly impressed with the “therapy” of Fritz Kaufmann, beca use it referred to “war neurosis” or “shell shock.” Based on the idea that antiwar behavior was a chemo-biological dysfunction, the “Kaufmann therapy” consisted of applied electrical shocks, actually more of a discipli - nary mea sure than true medical therapy. Th e a rmy was delighted that re - calcitrant troops, following electroshock, quickly agreed to return to se r vice. Psychiatry continued to grow in power even as its agenda continued to w iden. Psychiatrist P. J. Moebius, who had lectured on the “psychological feeble-mindedness of the woman,” pronounced, “Th e psychiatrist should be the judge about mental health, because only he knows what ill means.” Such arrogance of belief soon led to the creation of various psychiatric or ganizations, such as the Gesellschaft fur Rassenhygiene, or Society for Racial Hygiene, which only served to further the ambitions of the profes - sion. Since no one has yet found a signifi ca nt and general “cure” for insan - ity, psychiatrists turned to the dubious concept of prevention. Th is came to be known as “mental hygiene,” a bland term for the prevention of men - tal illness, whatever form that might take. In the Germany of the 1930s, t he rush to isolate and “cure” mental defectives quickly was interpreted to include malcontents and dissidents opposed to the Nazi regime. Th is open- ended concept resulted in the Nazi Sterilization Act, which went into eff ect in July 1933, just six months aft er Hitler’s ascension to power. One of the leading and articulate authorities behind the rationale for t his act was Dr. Ernst Rudin, a psychiatrist who in 1930 had traveled to Washington, D.C., to present a paper called “Th e Importance of Eugenics and Genetics in Mental Hygiene.” It was well received by those present as many Americans, especially among the globalists, had come to embrace the racist and elitist views of the German philos ophers. Nazi interest in science and psychological warfare was paralleled by t heir concern with eugenics, the scientifi c study of selective breeding to improve the human population.

Rocke feller and his only son, John D.

Th ese Rocke fel ler- funded institutions ensured their early entry into the fields of medicine, pharma - ceuticals, and education. Th e Rock e fellers were also interested in the eugenics movement, a pro - gram of scientifi ca lly applied genetic selection to maintain and improve their ideal for human characteristics, which included birth and popula - tion control.

In 1917, thanks to financial support from James Loeb, Dr. Emil Kraepe - lin, a professor at the University of Munich, was able to found the Deut - sche Forschungsanstalt fur Psychiatrie, or the German Research Institute fo r Psychiatry. “Kraepelin was certainly a conservative nationalist,” stated Roeder, Kubillus, and Burwell. “But he also was a pioneer of psychiatric atrocities such as racial hygiene and sterilization, who, except perhaps for Rudin, had no equal in his advocacy for a legal foundation for the policies of Nazi extermination.” By 1924, Kraepelin’s research institute, rescued from bankruptcy by"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"NAZI MIND CONTROL 185 Loeb’s money, had become incorporated into the prestigious Kaiser Wil - helm Institute, and the growing Nazi leadership was paying attention to i ts science. Initially, they went for the most defenseless of the German p opulation—the children. On July 14, 1933, only six months aft er Hitler was named chancellor of the Reich, the Law for the Prevention of Gene - tically Diseased Children was passed. A leading proponent for this legisla - tion was Ernst Rudin, by then director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. Leading the movement to eliminate “mental defectives” from the Ger - man population were lawyer Karl Binding and the psychiatrist Alfred H oche, who popularized the chilling phrase “ lebensunwertes Leben” —or “life unworthy of life”—in a 1920 tract titled Die Freigabe der Vernich - tung lebensunwerten Lebens, or “Lift ing Controls on the Destruction of Life Unworthy of Life.” “Th is text, arguably more than any other, made available to the Nazi regime an ‘ethical’ rationale for ‘euthanasia.’ Al - though in the early days of the regime the public discussion would focus on the prevention of off spring with hereditary disease, hence sterilization, the destruction of life unworthy of life would spread as an unspoken prin - ciple,” wrote John Cornwell in his 2003 book Hitler’s Scientists: Science, W ar, and the Dev il’s Pact . Th e ch osen means of prevention, enforced sterilization, was adminis - tered by special “hereditary health courts,” made up of two doctors— u sually psychiatrists—and one civil offi cial, usually a judge close to the Nazi Party, who acted as chairman. Th e Nazi euthanasia program was not carried out in the open but instead by secret decrees, as Hitler steadfastly refused to seek a legal ruling, knowing that such a program was illegal under existing laws. It is estimated that more than 400,000 people were sterilized as “life u nworthy of life” between 1934 and 1945. “Th e projected total of 410,000 was considered only preliminary, drawn mostly from people already in institutions; it was assumed that much greater numbers of people would eventually be identifi ed and sterilized,” stated Robert Jay Lift on in Th e Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide .

(The designation T4 referred to the address of the stone building from which they operated: Tiergartenstrasse 4.) Th e approved method of killing ordered by Hitler, acting on the advice of Dr. Heyde, was the use of carbon monoxide. In a prototype of the Nazi death camps, a fake shower room, complete with benches, was constructed and used to gas the first victims. Great pains were taken to employ what Robert Jay Lift on called “bu - reaucratic mystifi ca tion,” a snarl of red tape and bureaucracy so convo - luted that the victims, their families, and even those working within the s ystem did not realize the full extent of the euthanasia program. Interestingly enough, in 1941 Hitler ordered the offi cia l T4 euthanasia program halted for no recorded reason. Some have argued that Hitler may have developed pangs of conscience, while others believe that as more and more of the German population became aware of the killing, cries of ob - jection could have caused Hitler a political problem. Authors Roeder, Ku billus, and Burwell argued that the program was stopped simply be - cause it had achieved its original quota of victims. “Th e o riginal campaign apparently had accomplished its purpose and was shut down. But that did not mean that a new euthanasia program wasn’t waiting to begin,” they wrote."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"NAZI MIND CONTROL 187 Starting in April 1941, the now-experienced doctors of T4 began visit - ing the Nazi concentration camps and soon were practicing their newest e uthanasia program in earnest—the Endlosung, or final solution. “Th e extermination of the Jews was an exact replica of T4’s earlier euthanasia program,” stated Roeder, Kubillus, and Burwell. D UR ING THE WA R , as today, both medical doctors and psychiatrists were quite vulnerable to peer pressure as well as the goodwill of the state, which provided the credentials and certifi cates necessary for their practice. So it seemed natural that mind manipulation through psychiatry and psychol - ogy was soon joined by a companion therapy—drugs. German psychiatrists were merely following the lead of medical doc - tors, who in the twentieth century increasingly moved away from the tra - dition of homeopathy, which involved using minimal doses of drugs as t herapy, to allopathy, the straightforward treatment of disease with drugs. What therapy could not accomplish through psychological means might be accomplished through drugs. Th is trend to increase the use of prescrip - tion drugs set the stage for the rise of the giant pharmaceutical corpora - tions during the twentieth century. During the time of the Opium Wars of the late 1800s, any type of drug w as used for profi t. For example, in 1898, the German Bayer Company began mass production of heroin (diacetylmorphine) and used that name to market the new remedy. Bayer described heroin as a nonaddictive pana - cea for adult ailments and infant respiratory diseases. In the late 1800s, Ba yer also promoted cocaine, which until the 1920s was an ingredient in the soft drink Coca- Cola. But as more easily produced petrochemical drugs made their debut, t hey prompted the attention of the major global corporations. Th e Rock e feller family’s interest in pharmaceuticals reaches back to the days of John D.’s father, William “Big Bill” Rocke feller, who sold “Rock Oil,” a diuretic medicine that guaranteed “All Cases of Cancer Cured Unless Th ey Are Too Far Gone.” “William Rocke feller’s original miracle oil survived until quite recently as a concoction called Nujol, con - sisting principally of petroleum and peddled as a laxative,” wrote Eustace"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"188 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Mullins. “Nujol was manufactured by a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey, called Stanco, whose only other product, manufactured on the same premises, was the famous insecticide Flit.” Along with the previously documented business alliances between S tandard Oil and I. G. Farben, Standard Oil vice president Frank Howard also served as chairman of the research committee at Sloan Kettering In - stitute, today known as the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the N ew York City–based cancer center built in 1939 on land donated by John D. Rocke feller Jr. and financed by the Rocke feller family. According to the center’s literature, it has “long been a leader in cancer surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. It was the first to develop services spe - cifi ca lly dedicated to the psychiatric aspects of cancer, to the relief of can - cer pain, and to genetic counseling.” Howard, in addition to maintaining relations between Nazi I. G. F arben and Standard Oil, represented Rocke feller interests with the firm of Rohm and Haas, still one of the world’s largest suppliers of specialty chemicals. Current company literature states, “From maintaining the fresh - ness in fruits and vegetables to purifying antibiotics, we help customers cr eate products that enhance the way of life for people around the world. Today Rohm and Haas extends to the far corners of the earth, with sales in more than 100 countries.” According to Mullins, the American College of Surgeons maintained a m onopolistic control of U.S. hospitals through its Hospital Survey Com - mittee, with members Winthrop Aldrich and David McAlpine Pyle rep - resenting the Rocke fellers. In 1909, John D. Rocke feller Sr. extended his reach into the southern sta tes by a $1 million donation to establish the Rocke feller Sanitary Com - mission, dedicated to eradicating hookworm disease. “[D]espite its phil - anthropic goals, the Rocke feller Sanitary Commission required financial c ontributions from each of the eleven southern states in which it oper - ated, resulting in the creation of state departments of health in those s tates and opening up important new spheres of infl uence for their Drug Trust,” wrote Mullins.

West went on to become a top executive for forty years at the American Medical Association. Th e Rock e feller Institute for Medical Research is now Rocke feller Uni - versity. Another deep penetration of America’s education system was ma de in 1903, when John D. Rocke feller established the General Educa - tion Board (GEB). According to the Rocke feller Archives, “Th e [GEB] program included grants for endowment and general budgetary support of colleges and universities, support for special programs, fellowship and scholarship assistance to state school systems at all levels, and develop - ment of social and economic resources as a route to improved educational s ystems. Major colleges and universities across the U.S., as well as many small institutions in every state, received aid from the Board. Th e empha - sis, however, was on the South and the education of blacks.” “Rocke feller’s General Education Board has spent more than $100 mil - lion to gain control of the nation’s medical schools and turn our physi - cians to physicians of the allopathic school, dedicated to surgery and t he heavy use of drugs,” commented Mullins, adding, “America became the greatest and most productive nation in the world because we had the healthiest citizens in the world. When the Rocke feller Syndicate began its takeover of our medical profession in 1910, our citizens went into a sharp decline. Today, we suff er from a host of debilitating ailments, both mental and physical, nearly all of which can be traced directly to the operations of the chemical and drug monopoly, and which pose the greatest threat to our continued existence as a nation.” Mullins pointed to Britain’s Wellcome Trust as one of the world’s larg - est medical research charities. It finances research into the health of both a nimals and humans. It also illustrates the intertwining connections of the globalists. Th e k nighted Sir Oliver S. Franks, described as “one of the founders of the postwar world,” directed the Wellcome Trust as well as serving as British ambassador to the United States from 1948 to 1952. He was a di - rector of the Rocke feller Foundation and its principal representative in En gland.

Th e controversy over the fl uori - dation of municipal water supplies has raged since the 1950s and continues to day. Aluminum oxide is extracted from clay and bauxite. Th r ough a chemi - cal called cryolite the material is converted into aluminum. A by-product o f this process is sodium fl uoride, which for many years was used as a rat poison. One recent dictionary defined fl uoride as a “poisonous pale ye llow gaseous element of the halogen group.” Sodium fl uoride also acts as an enzyme inhibitor and has been linked by several studies—such as a 1982 report from the University of Iowa—to Alzheimer’s disease, a degenera - tive and fatal neural disease named for the German doctor Alois Alz- heimer. According to the Alzheimer Association, this brain-destroying d isease is the seventh leading cause of death in America today. Although aluminum has been associated with Alzheimer’s, such claims ha ve been disputed. Some have claimed that Alzheimer’s disease is more common in areas where the aluminum content in the water supply is highest, but the method and results of these studies have been quest ioned. But it is true that, in 1986, the Reagan administration’s Environmental Protection Agency raised the “safe” level of sodium fl uoride in public wa - ter supplies from 2 parts per million gallons to 4 parts, even though one pa rt per million has been shown to impair neurological effi ciency. In Oc - tober 2007, despite “heated hearings” in 2003, the Los Angeles–based M etropolitan Water District began fl uoridating the drinking water of 18 million Southern Californians in six counties, including San Diego. Ac - cording to a report by the Environmental Working Group (EWG), a W ashington- based, nonprofi t organization whose mission is to “protect public health and the environment,” the plan to fl uoridate water in South -"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"NAZI MIND CONTROL 191 ern California “will put 14.5 percent of children under one year old, and 12.5 percent of children one to two years old, over the recommended fl uo - ride exposure limits published by the National Academy of Sciences’ In - stitute of Medicine and endorsed by the American Dental Association. In L os Angeles County alone, more than 40,000 children age two and under will exceed the safe dose.” Bill Walker, EWG’s vice president for the West Coast, pointed to re - cent studies that call into question claims that fl u oridation is safe. A March 2006 National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council report identifi ed fl uoride as a potent hormone disruptor that may aff ect normal thyroid function; the NAS/NRC report also cited concerns about the potential of fl uoride to lower IQ, noting that the “consistency of study results appears significant enough to warrant additional research on the eff ects of fl uoride on intelligence.” Th at finding was echoed by a Decem - ber 2006 study published in the prestigious, peer-reviewed journal Th e Lanc et, which identifi ed fl uoride as an “emerging” neurotoxin; and a 2006 peer-reviewed study at Harvard strongly supported concerns that fl uori - dated water is linked to osteosarcoma, an oft e n-fatal form of bone cancer, in boys. Th e Harvard study found a fi ve-fold increase in bone cancer among teenage boys who drank fl uoridated water from ages six through eight, compared to those drinking nonfl uoridated water. Brain studies reported by the Alzheimer’s Society in En gland show t hat aluminum accumulates in nerve cells that are particularly vulnerable to Alzheimer’s disease, although not all persons exposed to aluminum develop Alzheimer’s. Although many studies on animals and on isolated cells have shown that aluminum has toxic eff ects on the nervous system, it is claimed that the doses of aluminum used were much higher than those occurring naturally in tissues. Th is obviously raises the question of how much fl uoride/aluminum the public is ingesting from nonnatural sources, such as the fl uoridation of drinking water. Th e h uman brain contains 100 billion nerve cells (neurons) that form networks to manage our thinking, learning, and remembering. By the mid-1990s, studies were indicating a link between Alzheimer’s and alumi - num. But just as the debate over the link between cigarettes and cancer"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"192 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH lasted decades, due to the obstructionist studies funded by the tobacco industry, the controversy over aluminum—and sodium fl uoride— continues today. Numerous Web sites and periodicals have carried the accusation that sod ium fl uoride was placed in the drinking water of Nazi concentration camps to keep inmates pacifi ed and susceptible to external control. Such use of fl uoridation by the Nazis to dull the senses of prisoners was de - scribed by Charles Eliot Perkins, a prominent U.S. industrial chemist w hom the U.S. government sent to help reconstruct the I. G. Farben chemical plants in Germany at the end of the war. In a 1954 letter to the Lee Foundation for Nutritional Research, Perkins stated: “Th e German chemists worked out a very ingenious and far-reaching plan of mass con - trol that was submitted to and adopted by the German General Staff . Th is plan was to control the population of any given area through mass medi - cation of drinking water supplies . . . . In this scheme of mass control, ‘so - dium fl u oride’ occupied a prominent place . . . . However, and I want to ma ke this very definite and very positive, the real reason behind water fluoridation is not to benefit children’s teeth . . . . Th e r eal purpose behind water fl uoridation is to reduce the resistance of the masses to domination and control and loss of liberty. . . . Repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fl uorine [ sic ] will in time gradually reduce the individual’s power to re - sist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotizing this area of brain tissu e, and make him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him . . . . I was told of this entire scheme by a German chemist who was an offi cia l of the great Farben chemical industries and was prominent in the Nazi movement at the time . . . . I say this with all the earnestness and sin - cerity of a scientist who has spent nearly 20 years research [ si c ] into the chemistry, biochemistry, physiology, and pathology of ‘fl uorine [ sic ].’ . . . Any person who drinks artifi cially fl uoridated water for a period of one year or more will never again be the same person, mentally or physically.” A Chr istian Science Monitor survey in 1954 showed that seventy-nine of the eighty- one Nobel Prize winners in chemistry, medicine, and physi - ology declined to endorse water fl u oridation.

Prozac, whose scientifi c na me is fl uoxetine, is 94 percent fl uoride. More than 21 million prescriptions for fl uoxetine were filled in the United States in 2006, making it one of the most prescribed antide - pressants. Every U.S. Public Health Service surgeon general from the 1950s to t his day has supported the introduction of this poison into America’s wa - ter supply, even though fl u oride, this poisonous waste product of alumi - num manufacture, accumulates in the human body and has been shown to aff ect tooth decay only in children under twelve years of age. It is quite ironic that Prozac, which is 94 percent fl u oride and given to hyperactive children, requires a prescription from a licensed physician while the same substance can be placed in our drinking water by dealers who have no medical training, no license to dispense medications, and no idea to whom they are administering this corrosive, toxic, and impairing substance. In 1946, Oscar Ewing, a Wall Street attorney and former counsel to t he Aluminum Company of America (now known by the acronym Al - coa), was appointed by President Harry S. Truman to head the Federal S ecurity Agency, which placed Ewing in charge of not only the U.S. Pub - lic Health Service but also the Social Security Administration and the Offi c e of Education. Congressman A. L. Miller, a physician turned Republican politician, sa id that Ewing had been placed in his position and highly paid by the Rocke feller syndicate to promote fl uoridation. Miller stated, “Th e chief supporter of the fl uoridation of water is the U.S. Public Health Service. Th is is part of Mr. Ewing’s Federal Security Agency. Mr. Ewing is one of the highly paid lawyers for the Aluminum Company of America.” Other opponents were less kind.

It should come as no surprise that the men behind the documented C IA mind- control projects—MKULTR A, ARTICHOKE, BLUEBIRD, MKDELTA, etc.—had received Nazi medical science passed along by Paperclip doctors and their protégés. Th e infusion of Nazi mind-control specialists within the fl edgling CIA resulted in Project MKULTR A (pro- nounced M-K-ULTR A), a code name for mind-control research that con - tinued until the late 1960s, when it was said to have been discontinued. P roject MKULTR A was created in 1953 by CIA offi cer Richard Helms, a good friend to CIA psychiatrist Dr. Sidney Gottlieb. It was the brainchild of then CIA director Allen Dulles. Dulles reportedly was intrigued by re - ports of mind-control techniques allegedly conducted by Soviet, Chinese, a nd North Koreans on U.S. prisoners during the Korean War. Published accounts show this project not only used drugs to manipu - late a person’s personality, but also electronic signals to alter brain func - tioning.

As this was the twenty-fi ft h com - pound of lysergic acid diethylamide, synthetically produced by Sandoz, H ofmann named it LSD-25. Th e ed itors of Consumer Reports, in their monumental 1972 book Licit & Illicit Drugs, noted: “Psychiatrists were naturally interested from the beginning in LSD eff ects.

Donovan called to - gether a group of psychiatrists, who tested numerous drugs, including al - cohol, barbiturates, and even caff e ine. Plant extracts such as peyote, scopolamine, and even marijuana were also tested. In 1947, the old OSS was superseded by the newly created CIA, within w hich drug experimentation continued, though with mixed results. Liai - sons were formed between academics in universities, police departments, cr iminology laboratories, doctors, psychiatrists, and even hypnotists. Se - cret CIA funding was provided and experiments were not limited to labo - ratory animals. Like the Nazis before them, they also used sometimes u nsuspecting human guinea pigs.

Some researchers wondered whether the drug revolution was simply happenstance—or part of the fascist globalist plan to weaken the structure of American society. Following hearings by a Senate committee on the testing of human su bjects in 1977, Senator Ted Kennedy referred to the infamous CIA mind-control experiments by stating, “Th e deputy director of the CIA revealed that over thirty universities and institutions were involved in an ‘extensive testing and experimentation’ program which included covert drug tests on unwitting citizens at all social levels, high and low, native Americans and foreign . . . . Th e i ntelligence community of this nation, which requires a shroud of secrecy in order to operate, has a very sacred trust from the American people. Th e CIA’s program of human experi - mentation of the fift i es and sixties violated that trust. It was violated again on the day the bulk of the agency’s records were destroyed in 1973. It is violated each time a responsible offi cial refuses to recollect the details of the program.” One certain violation involved the death of a scientist working on mind c ontrol. According to the government, in 1953, Dr. Frank Olson, a bio - logical and mind- control scientist working for the U.S. Army at Fort Detr ick, Maryland, was surreptitiously given an LSD-laced drink by Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, while attending a conference at Deep Creek Lodge in Maryland. Some days later, a distraught and hallucinating Olson threw himself out of a high window of a New York hotel. It appeared to be either a drug-induced accident or a suicide.

Rutz claimed to be the victim of government abuse and mind-control experiments. She mentioned an astounding connection. Referring to a woman who described “eye experiments” at a residential school where “they were trying to change our eye color from brown to blue,” Rutz stated, “Th is particularly caught my attention, since the change of eye color was a pet project of Auschwitz ‘Doctor’ Josef Mengele, aka Dr. Black, as I knew him, who I allege worked alongside Dr. Ewen Cam - eron, Sid Gottlieb, and others.” Another seedy side to this experimentation on unwitting subjects in - volved a CIA contract agent named George Hunter White, who worked u nder the auspices of Dr. Gottlieb. White would bring unsuspecting men from local bars to a CIA-financed bordello in San Francisco, where he would give them LSD-spiked drinks and then watch the men have sex with prostitutes from behind a two-way mirror. Th e U.S. taxpayers paid for it all, as White would send bills for his “unorthodox expenses” to Dr. Gottlieb. White once said of this work, “I was a very minor missionary, actually a heretic, but I toiled wholeheartedly in the vineyards because it was fun, fun, fun. Where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, kill, cheat, steal, rape, and pillage with the sanction and blessing of the All- Highest?” Indeed, where else but in an agency penetrated by displaced Nazis and t heir philosophies? Much of the drug experimentation was centered at secret facilities at t he Edgewood Arsenal, located on Chesapeake Bay northeast of Balti - more. In 1955, thanks to the infl u x of Nazi chemists, a new drug-testing program was instituted at Edgewood. “Volunteer soldiers were recruited, but not told what drugs they would be given, nor that men had died as the result of similar experiments.

Five hundred eighty- fi ve men were given LSD; the rest were administered other unspecifi ed drugs.” Carol Rutz produced a letter she received from a U.S. soldier who un - derwent experimentation at Edgewood Arsenal: “I can see where you d on’t believe anything coming out of the government.

U.S. soldiers were exposed to tabun and mustard gas in an E dgewood gas chamber reminiscent of those in the Nazi death camps. “In 1949, the direction of Edgewood’s work abruptly changed,” noted H unt. “A consultant of the Chemical Division at [European Command] sent information about an amazing drug, LSD, that caused hallucinations and suicidal tendencies in humans. As a result, Edgewood’s [scientifi c di - rector of the Chemical and Radiological Laboratories Dr.] L. Wilson G reene seized the idea of conducting ‘psychochemical warfare.’ He then suggested that $50,000 be set aside in the 1950 budget to study psy - chochemicals.” Friedrich Hoffmann, another Paperclip chemist, traveled the world in sea rch of exotic and new psychochemicals. He used the University of"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"NAZI MIND CONTROL 201 Delaware’s chemistry department as a cover to prevent anyone from con - necting him to Edgewood Arsenal. Th i s subterfuge was easy enough to maintain, because both the department chairman William Mosher and Professor James Moore were heavily involved in the MKULTR A pro - gram. “We were all being paid by the CIA,” Moore told Linda Hunt. SS Brigadefuehrer, or brigadier general, Walter Paul Emil Schreiber, w hom one U.S. Army offi cer described as “the prototype of an ardent and convinced Nazi who used the party to further his own ambitions,” worked for more than a decade for the chemical division of the U.S. Europe an Command. His attempt to join Paperclip scientists in America was thwarted when counterintelligence connected Schreiber to hiding SS of - fice rs and unexplained business dealings with both the French and the Soviets. According to Gordon Th om as, author of Mindfi eld: Th e Untold Story Behind CIA Experiments with MKULTR A & Germ Warfare, “Walter Schreiber had been the paymaster for all the doctors working the Nazi biochemical warfare programs. Under the cover of Paperclip he was brought to the United States. By 1951 he was working at the Air Force School of Medicine in Texas.” A year later, Schreiber, fearing that the media might discover his background, obtained a visa and found a job in Argentina, where his daughter was living. Th ere in 1952, he met his old friend, Dr. Josef Mengele. “U.S. laws governing the American zone of Germany forbade the Ger - mans from doing research on chemical warfare,” noted Hunt. “But that d id not stop the Army Chemical Corps or the High Commissioner of Germany [ John J. McCloy], the U.S. organization that replaced OMGUS, from hiring chemical warfare experts as ‘consultants’ or funding German industries to produce chemical warfare materials for the United States.” Hunt may not have noticed the interconnectedness of the personalities a nd business interests in both Germany and America before, during, and just aft er the war. But one person who did notice that funny business was taking place within the CIA was John K. Vance, a graduate of Columbia University who had served as a military translator at the Nuremberg tri - als. Vance stumbled upon MKULTR A in the spring of 1963 while work - ing on an inspector general’s survey of the CIA’s technical services division."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"202 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH A resulting inspector general’s report concluded, “Th e concepts involved in manipulating human behavior are found by many people both within and outside the agency to be distasteful and unethical.” As the result of Vance’s discovery and the inspector general’s report, the agency began scaling back the project, which was eventually said to have ended in the late 1960s. Th e M KULTR A program, which used patients in psychiatric hospi - tals, and other unwitting subjects, to develop mind- control techniques, beca me public knowledge in 1977, during hearings conducted by a Senate committee on intelligence chaired by Senator Frank Church. Some of the most distinguished figures in psychiatry participated in MKULTR A, including Dr. Ewen Cameron, the man whom Allen Dulles sent to study Rudolf Hess and who later served as president of both the American and Canadian Psychiatric Associations as well as the World Psychiatric Asso - ciation. Any in-depth study of MKULTR A shows that the CIA, in addition to seek ing a truth serum, also was highly interested in the ability to program individuals to act in accordance with someone else’s will. Th e 1962 Frank Sinatra film Th e Manchurian Candidate portrayed a programmed assas- sin ordered to kill a ranking political fi gure. Th is m ovie came out at the same time the CIA was actively working on just such a program, thanks in great part to the groundwork laid down years earlier by Nazi mind- control experts. In the words of Kathleen Ann Sullivan, who claimed to have been part o f the MKULTR A program as reported by Gordon Th omas, author of Mind Field : “I am a survivor of the MKULTR A program. It was run by the CIA and designed to control a subject’s mind and will to the point where he or she would become an assassin. To achieve this I was forced to undergo extensive drugging, electroshock, sensory deprivation, hypnosis, partake in pornographic films, act as a prostitute, and much else.

In the war’s aftermath, some of the same personalities who helped place H itler in power came back into play. John J.

As historian William L. Shirer wrote in Th e R ise and Fall of the Th ird Reich, “In March 1948, 39 of the death sentences were commuted; in April, General Lucius D.

When it was discovered that their work was ineffectual, these Nazis were allowed to immigrate to the United States, their former activities concealed. Such men included former Belarusan president Radislaw Ostrowsky, wh o was off ered immunity from prosecution for war crimes; Franz Kushel, an SS general who commanded the Belarus Brigade and was re - sponsible for the execution of more than forty thousand Jews; Stanislaw S tankievich, who organized the execution of seven thousand Jews; and Emanuel Jasiuk, who, as the wartime mayor of Kletsk, supervised the execution of more than fi ve thousand Jews in just one day.

Th e like-mindedness of CFR members—one cannot ask to join, you must be invited and pass a stringent vetting pro cess to show that you are in agreement with their worldview—along with their close ties with the corporate business world has caused many conspiracy writers to view the CFR as a group with plans to control the world through multinational business mergers, economic treaties, and global government. Th e activities of the CFR may have been summarized by sociologist G.

According to Peter Levenda’s Unholy Alliance, Ot to Skorzeny, the Nazi commando who may have found Solomon’s treasure, made his way to postwar Egypt, where he created an Egyptian “Gestapo” staff ed almost completely with former SS offi cers. According to Levenda, this was a mea - sure “that received wholehearted support from CIA director Allen Dulles, w ho was at that time involved with Reinhard Gehlen in developing an anticommunist espionage service within the ranks of CIA.” Th is o peration encompassed the Nazi- associated Muslim Brotherhood, a progenitor of today’s al-Qaeda terrorist organization. Th e c onnection between Muslim fanatics and Nazis, according to John Loft us, began with Muslim Brotherhood founder Hassan al-Banna, who formed a group of Egyptian youth dedicated to social reform and Islamic morals. He was a devotee of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the eighteenth- century Muslim who founded the Wahhabi sect that teaches that any additions or interpretations of Islam aft er the tenth century are false and should be eradicated, even by violence. “In the 1920s there was a young Egyptian named al-Banna. And al- Ba nna formed this nationalist group called the Muslim Brotherhood. Al- Banna was a devout admirer of Adolf Hitler and wrote to him frequently. So per sis tent was he in his admiration of the new Nazi Party that in the 1930s, al-Banna and the Muslim Brotherhood became a secret arm of Nazi intelligence,” said Loft us, who had unpre ce dented access to secret U.S. government and NATO intelligence files. “Th e A rab Nazis had much in common with the new Nazi doctrines.

Aft e r World War II, the Muslim Brotherhood and its German intelli - gence handlers were sought for war crimes, as they were not considered r egular military units. Following arrests in Cairo, captured Brotherhood members were turned over to the British Secret Service, who hired them to fi ght against the infant state of Israel in 1948. Loft us stated: Only a few people in the Mossad know this, but many of the mem - bers of the Arab Armies and terrorist groups that tried to strangle the i nfant State of Israel were the Arab Nazis of the Muslim Brother - hood. What the British did then, they sold the Arab Nazis to the p re de ces sor (the OSS) of what became the CIA (soon to be headed by Allen Dulles). It may sound stupid, it may sound evil, but it did hap - pen. Th e i dea was that we were going to use the Arab Nazis in the Middle East as a counterweight to the Arab communists. Just as the Soviet Union was funding Arab communists, we would fund the Arab Nazis to fight against [them]. And lots of secret classes took place. We kept the Muslim Brotherhood on our payroll. But the Egyptians became nervous. [Egyptian President Gamal Abdal] Nasser ordered all of the Muslim Brotherhood [to get] out of Egypt [in 1954] or be imprisoned, and we would execute them all. During the 1950s, the CIA evacuated the Nazis of the Muslim Brotherhood to Saudi Arabia [still a stronghold of the Wahhabi sect]. Now when they arrived in Saudi Arabia . . . [one] student was named Osama bin Laden. Osama bin Laden was taught by the Nazis of the Muslim Brotherhood who had emigrated to Saudi Arabia. In 1979 the CIA drew fanatics from these Saudi Brotherhood members and sent them to Afghanistan to fi ght the Soviet Rus sians. “We had to re - name them,” said Loft us . “We couldn’t call them the Muslim Brotherhood, because that was too sensitive a name. Its Nazi cast was too known. So we called them the Maktab al Khidimat il Mujahideen, the MAK . . . . we left t his army of Arab fascists in the field of Afghanistan.” Once out of Afghan - i stan, the mujahideen became known as al-Qaeda, or the Base. While many"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"BUSINESS AS USUAL 209 people still think the term “base” refers to some central headquarters, former British foreign secretary Robin Cook told the House of Commons the term actually referred to a computer database containing the names of Muslim activists, mujahideen, and others long used by the CIA. Following the Soviet withdrawal from Afghani stan, the Saudis didn’t w ant the fanatics to return, so they bribed Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda followers to stay out of Saudi Arabia. “Th e re are many fl avors and branches, but they are all Muslim Brotherhoods . . . . So the Muslim Brotherhood became this poison that s pread throughout the Middle East, and on 9/11, it began to spread around the world,” concluded Loft us, who added that current CIA mem - bers don’t know this history. “[T]he current generation CIA are good and d ecent Americans and I like them a lot. Th ey’re trying to do a good job, but part of their problem is their files have been shredded. All of these se - crets have to come out.” D UR ING THE 1950 S, while Dulles headed the CIA, his brother, John Foster Dulles, was President Eisenhower’s secretary of state. Both were in prime positions to shape the Nazification of America. “In the chill of the Cold War, few Americans remembered that John F oster Dulles had been pro-Nazi before Hitler invaded Poland,” observed Walter Bowart, a journalist and former editor who authored the book Op - eration Mind Control . “ No one thought, either, to question the fact that while John Foster Dulles was running the State Department, his brother Allen was running the CIA, which he once described as a State Depart - ment for dealing with unfriendly governments. No one seemed at all dis- turbed by the Dulles dynasty, and only a handful of people realized to what ex tent the Dulles brothers held power in the Eisenhower administration.” Th e G erman banking industry particularly profi ted from such connec - tions as the Dulles brothers and McCloy. Immediately aft e r the war ended, Allied authorities ordered the breakup of Germany’s largest bank, Deut - sche Bank. Initially, the banking giant was split into ten regional banks, b ut by 1953 these were consolidated into three major banks—Nordeutsche Bank AG, Suddeutsche Bank AG, and Rheinisch-Westfalische Bank AG."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"210 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH A mere four years later, without any opposition, these three major banks merged and began takeovers, including the London Morgan Grenfell in - vestment bank in 1989, the East German central bank following reunifi - cation in 1990, Banker’s Trust of New York in 1999, and two large R ussian banks in 2006. By the turn of the current century, Deutsche Bank was reunited and had become a world banking leader. Astute authorities in both Britain and the United States undoubtedly r ecognized Deputy Fuehrer Martin Bormann’s flight capital plan. But they were dissuaded from action by the general euphoria at the war’s end, the chaotic conditions in Europe, the idea that growth would restore the wrecked Europe an economy, and the increasing belief that the United States would soon have to confront a victorious and powerful Soviet Union. Th ere was also the behind-the-scenes power of men in banking and commerce who had been in league with the Nazis and still carried sympathy for their cause. “Trea sury offi cia ls in Washington, as in London, knew what was tran - spiring; the teams they sent into the fi el d uncovered enough evidence to prove a definite pattern,” wrote Paul Manning. “As for the news media, it did not seem important, although long-term it was really the biggest of the postwar stories. Yet so quietly was it handled by the Germans, and so diffi dent was the reaction by the Allies, that few ripples rose to the sur - face, and investigators of the U.S. Treasury Department were taken off t he case.” Investigators were reassigned by their superiors, some of whom had been business partners with the Nazis for years. One such example was attorney Russell A. Nixon, who, as a member of t he U.S. Military Government Cartel Unit, found himself working directly under Brigadier General William H. Draper Jr., an advocate of eugenics who sat with James Forrestal on the board of directors of Dillon, Read Com - pany, the fi rm t hat early on had helped finance the German cartels. Accord - ing to Professor Antony C. Sutton, “Th re e Wall Street houses—Di llon, Read; Harris, Forbes; and National Citys Bank—handled three-quarters of the reparation loans used to create the German cartel system, including the dominant I. G. Farben and Vereinigte Stahlwerke, which together produced 95 percent of the explosives for the Nazi side in World War II.” Nixon was blocked at every turn in his attempt to break up the Farben"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"BUSINESS AS USUAL 211 cartel. He finally went over the head of Brigadier General Draper, meet - ing with General Lucius D. Clay, military governor of the U.S. zone in Ge rmany. Th e general was told Draper had canceled orders to dismantle or destroy Farben facilities, lied about bomb damage to Farben plants, and deliberately violated General Eisenhower’s orders to break up the Farben cartel. Despite Nixon’s complaints, nothing was done. When Nixon took the initiative and had Nazi industrialist Richard Freudenberg arrested, U.S. ambassador to Germany Robert Murphy ordered him re - leased. One occupation offi cia l explained Murphy’s decision by comment - ing, “Th is ma n Freudenberg is an extremely capable industrialist: a kind of Henry Ford.” Nixon later told a Senate subcommittee in Washington, “Generally s peaking, in spite of the efforts that have been made, at the present time there is a continuation of the dissipation and further concealment of these [Nazi] assets throughout all the neutral countries.” Another Allied investigator, Department of Justice attorney James S tewart Martin, was sent to U.S. Military Command in London to inves- tigate collaboration between the Nazis and American businessmen. Mar - tin bristled when he found his commanding offi ce r was a Colonel Graeme K. Howard, an offi cia l with General Motors. Aft er Martin pointed out the cozy relationship General Motors had with the Nazis, Howard was quietly reassigned back to the States.

Draper Jr., a business part - ner with Prescott Bush, who, in July 1945, was appointed head of the eco - nomic division of the U.S. Control Commission, which decided which N azi corporations would be saved and who would face war crimes prose - cution. Th is placed Draper in almost as powerful a position as Germany’s new high commissioner John J. McCloy, who, besides banking for the Nazis, had spent a year in Italy as a financial adviser to Mussolini and shared Hitler’s box at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Martin also may have stumbled across the answer to why the interna - tional business community turned against Hitler. Th e l eading bankers and industrialists were looking forward to a postwar world composed of intertwining corporate business connections among the nations of the world—a New World Order. Hitler, on the other hand, was planning to attack the United States just as soon as he had eff ective rocket and long-range bomber delivery systems in place. Th e globalists did not desire a continuous war, nor did they want Hitler to control a world National Socialist government. Th ey had their own plans. “[T]he 750 new corporations established under the Bormann [fl ig ht capital] program gave themselves absolute control over a postwar eco - nomic network of viable, prosperous companies that stretched from the R uhr to the ‘neutrals’ of Europe and to the countries of South America; a control that continues today and is easily maintained through the bearer bonds or shares issued by these corporations to cloak real ownership,” stated Paul Manning, who worked with Edward R. Murrow covering the war in Europe for CBS Radio. Manning revealed that “there are U.S. Treasury old-timers of World War II still not aware of the magnitude of the Bormann operation and of its success. Th ose who know, in Washing - ton, in South America, and in the capitals of Europe, are locked together i n a conspiracy of silence.” No one in a position of power within the financial centers of Washing -"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"BUSINESS AS USUAL 213 ton, Wall Street, the City of London, or Paris desired a real search for the scattered German assets. Manning explained: “Th ey had understandable reasons if you overlook morality: the financial benefi ts for cooperation (collaboration had become an old-hat term with the war winding down) were very enticing, depending on one’s importance and ability to be of service to the organization and the 750 corporations they were secretly manipulating, to say nothing of the known multinationals such as I. G. Farben, Th yssen AG, and Siemens.” Without the German industrial base that had been its foundation for y ears, the Europe an economy was suff ering. U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff di- rectives had ordered that nothing be done to rebuild Germany’s indus- tries. But business is business, and by the summer of 1947, President R oosevelt’s friend and chief of staff General George Catlett Marshall had become secretary of state under President Truman. Th e son of a prosper - ous coal producer and a participant in every high-level policy conference f rom Casablanca to Yalta and Potsdam, Marshall convinced Truman that it was in the best interests of Europe an prosperity that Germany be al - lowed to rehabilitate its economy. Th us , the Marshall Plan was born, and millions of dollars of aid began pouring into war-devastated Europe. Many Americans, including Colonel Robert McCormick, editor of the Chi cago Tribune, and Senator Joseph McCarthy, attacked the Marshall Plan as merely another Rockefeller scheme to bilk Amerian taxpayers. Ac - cording to Mullins, “Th e Ma rshall Plan had been rushed through Con - gress by a powerful and vocal group, headed by Winthrop Aldrich, p resident of Chase Manhattan Bank, and Nelson Rocke feller’s brother-in-law, ably seconded by Nelson Rocke feller and William Clay - ton, the head of Anderson, Clayton Company.” Marshall Plan money fl o wed through the same banking conduits as before the war, such as the 1936 partnership between the J. Henry Schroeder Bank of New York and Rocke feller family members, described by Time magazine as “the economic booster of the Rome-Berlin Axis.” Partners in Schroeder, Rocke feller and Company included Avery Rocke - feller, nephew of John D., Baron Bruno von Schroeder in London, and Ku rt Freiherr von Schroeder of the Bank of International Settlements and the Gestapo in Cologne. Attorneys for the firm were John Foster"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"214 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Dulles and Allen Dulles of Sullivan and Cromwell. Future CIA director and Warren Commission member Allen Dulles sat on the board of Schroeder. “Further connections linked the Paris branch of Chase Na - tional Bank to Schroeder as well as the pro-Nazi Worms Bank and Stan - dard Oil of New Jersey in France. Standard Oil’s Paris representatives w ere directors of the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas, which had intricate connections to the Nazis and to Chase,” noted New York Times journalist Charles Higham. William Bramley, who researched the causes of war in his 1990 book Th e God s of Eden, noted these international banking connections: Max Warburg, a major German banker, and his brother Paul Warburg, who had been instrumental in establishing the Federal Reserve System in the United States, were directors of I. G. Farben. H. A. Metz of I. G. Farben was a di - rector of the Warburg Bank of Manhattan, which later became part of the Rock e feller Chase Manhattan Bank. Standard Oil of New Jersey had been a cartel partner with I. G. Farben prior to the war. One American I. G. Farben director was C. E. Mitchell, who was also director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and of Warburg’s National City Bank. It is interesting to note that throughout the war, Chase maintained its fi nancial connections with the Nazis through its Paris bank. Further, I. G. Farben chief Hermann Schmitz served as Chase president for seven years prior to the war. According to Manning, “Schmitz’s wealth—largely I. G. Farben bearer bonds converted to the Big Th r ee successor firms, shares in Standard Oil of New Jersey (equal to those held by the Rockefel - lers), General Motors, and other U.S. blue chip industrial stocks, and the 7 00 secret companies controlled in his time by I.

Th e Bormann organization in South America utilizes the voting power of the Schmitz trust along with their own assets to guide the multinationals they control, as they keep steady the economic course of the Fatherland.” Aft e r the war, twenty-four lower I.

Regarding the relationship between Schmitz and Martin Bormann, Ma nning wrote: “Th eir association was close and trusting over the years, and it is the considered opinion of those in their circle that the wealth possessed by Hermann Schmitz was shift ed to Switzerland and South America, and placed in trust with Bormann, the legal heir to Hitler.” Th ese long- standing banking and business connections coupled with the Schmitz business network allowed Reichsleiter Martin Bormann to forge a formidable Nazi- controlled organization for postwar activities. Th e late Jim Keith, author of several conspiracy books, wrote, “[I]n re - searching the shape of totalitarian control during this century, I saw that t he plans of the Nazis manifestly did not die with the German loss of World War II. Th e ideology and many of the principal players survived and fl ourished aft er the war, and have had a profound impact on postwar history, and on events taking place today.” Interestingly enough, the Nazis’ attempt at central control through the e conomic sector produced the early stages of a united Europe so sought by Hitler. A FT ER THE WA R , a devastated Europe looked to Germany for economic leadership. Th e economic steps taken that became the Common Market took the shape of prewar Nazi plans. “[S]omehow the Germans had the answer originally in 1942 when they were melding the economic institu - tions of the Continent into their own design,” noted Manning. It is interesting to note that the present Euro pean Union (EU) began a s merely economic measures. From this reasonable beginning as a trade organization, the Common Market evolved into the Europe an Union, a supranational and intergovernmental body with tendrils into all aspects of Europe an life. In 1950, French foreign minister Robert Schuman pro - posed the joint management of the French and West German coal and s teel industries.

It was thought that this mutual endeavor would ensure against another war between these nations. It also could be seen as a means of consolidating the Nazi business holdings of the Bormann organization. Th e Eu rope an Economic Community, better known as the Common Market, was established in 1957 by the Treaty of Rome, signed by the same nations as in 1951. George McGhee, a member of the secretive Bil - derberg Group and former U.S. ambassador to West Germany, acknowl - edged that “the Treaty of Rome, which brought the Common Market i nto being, was nurtured at Bilderberg meetings.” Again, the Common Market was styled as merely a step toward equal - izing trade balances and tariff s . But with the 1992 signing of the Treaty Establishing the Europe an Community, popularly known as the Maas - tricht Treaty, the word “Economic” was deleted from both the treaty and t he community. By 2000, the Europe an Union was composed of various economic, political, and judicial institutions including the Europe an Cen - tral Bank, the Europe an Parliament, the Europe an Court of Justice, and a uni fied Europe an currency, the Euro. The 1942 Nazi vision of a unified Europe had become a reality. B UT IF THE reality of the Nazi vision of a united Europe appeared to sig - nal success for the emerging Fourth Reich, nothing showed more success t han the seeds that had been sown in the postwar United States. In the postwar period, FDR Democrats, who looked favorably on fed - eral social and economic controls, were firmly in the pocket of the global c orporate elite, although there was a small problem with President Harry S.

According to authors John Loft us and Mark Aarons, “When Truman was reelected in 1948, [future Presi - dent Richard M.] Nixon became Allen Dulles’s mouthpiece in Congress. B oth he and Senator Joseph McCarthy received volumes of classifi ed in - formation to support the charge that the Truman administration was fi lled with ‘pinkos.’ When McCarthy went too far in his Communist in - vestigations, it was Nixon who worked with his next- door neighbor, CIA d irector Walter Bedell Smith, to steer the investigations away from the intelligence community [and the Nazis].” “Th e partnership between Al - len Dulles and Richard Nixon was truly a Faustian bargain, but it is hard t o tell just who is Faust and who is Mephistopheles in the scenario,” wrote Peter Levenda. Nixon, who joined the Council on Foreign Relations in 1961 but re - signed in 1965 aft e r his membership became a campaign issue, got an ini - tial boost to his political career by befriending a Nazi named Nicolae Ma laxa. A Romanian who was a former business partner of Nazi Luft - waff e ch ief Hermann Goering, Malaxa had belonged to Baron Otto von Bolschwing’s Gestapo network, as had his associate, Valerian Trifa, who was then living in Detroit. Both were members of the Nazi Iron Guard in Romania and had fl ed prosecution for their role in the deaths of many Jews. Th eir common interest was in Richard Nixon, who was elected vice president in 1952. In late 1946, Nixon’s infl u ence, along with that of the Dulles brothers, freed Malaxa’s money frozen in Chase National Bank during the war. Th e Treasury Department official whose firm won Malaxa’s case to release the money was the same man who froze these assets in the first place. “Such interrelationships were very common between émigré Fascists and the right wing of the American establishment,” noted Loft us and Aarons. According to the late Mae Brussell, a California conspiracy researcher a nd hostess of the World Watchers International radio program, Trifi a came to the United States with the help of the opportunistic Baron von Bolschwing, an early member of the Nazi Party and highly placed intelli - gence operative.

Th e legalities were handled by the Dulles brothers’ law firm of Sul - livan and Cromwell. “Undersecretary of State Adolph Berle, who had h elped Nixon and star witness Whittaker Chambers convict Alger Hiss, personally testifi ed on Malaxa’s behalf before a congressional subcommit - tee on immigration,” noted Brussell. A company called Western Tube was another eff or t to further help Malaxa. In 1951, Nixon introduced a private bill in Congress, which would have allowed Malaxa to remain in the United States despite provi - sions of the Displaced Persons Act, which prohibited persons with Fascist b ackgrounds. When this eff ort failed, Malaxa pretended to create West - ern Tube, which manufactured a seamless tube that he claimed was vital t o the Korean War eff ort. Loft us and Aarons reported, “He set up his company in Nixon’s hometown of Whittier, California, and registered it in the same building as the law firm of Bewley, Kroop & Nixon. Nixon’s former law partner, Th omas Bewley, was secretary of Malaxa’s company, and the vice president was another Nixon crony.” Th ey added that West - ern Tube never made any tubes. “Th e c ompany was used to evade millions of dollars’ worth of taxes and then dissolved,” they noted. It was the $2 million fee Nixon received from Malaxa that funded his su ccessful election campaign for Congress. “In 1946 Nixon had gotten a ca l l from Herma n L . Perr y a sk ing if he wa nted to r un for Cong ress aga inst Rep. Jerry Voorhis. Perry later became president of Western Tube,” wrote Mae Brussell. In 1952, in spite of being granted permanent resident status in the U nited States, Malaxa moved from Whittler to Argentina, where he joined Argentine dictator Juan Peron and Hitler’s chief commando Otto Skorzeny in profi table business dealings with the network created by Mar - tin Bormann and Allen Dulles. Meanwhile, ranking Republicans were abetting the infl ux of Nazis. Elmer Holmes Bobst of Warner-Lambert Pharmaceutical, described as “a mentor and father fi gure” to Nixon, was a power behind Nixon’s 1960 presidential campaign.

A quick look at America’s reaction to libera - tion movements in postwar Europe demonstrates the hypocrisy of the oft e n-stated Eisenhower-era Republican policies to “roll back communism.” In 1953, half a million citizens of the so- called German Democratic R epublic (GDR) staged a revolt against the East German regime, only to be violently suppressed by troops and tanks. No further large-scale dem - onstrations were to take place in East Germany until 1989, the year before t he GDR ceased to exist. Th r ee years later, Polish workers attempted their own rebellion against the Communist regime. Widespread violence was only averted aft er China’s Mao Tse-tung convinced Rus sian Premier Nikita Khrushchev to allow Polish Communist Wladyslaw Gomulka to assume authority and institute reforms in Poland. In late October 1956, the people of Hungary spontaneously rose up a gainst their Soviet occupiers, many in response to broadcasts of support by the BBC, Radio Free Europe, and the Voice of America.

Interestingly enough, his political career may have come about because o f his relationship with an alleged Nazi spy.

Corporate heads and their Nazi backers must have been mollifi ed to know that Kennedy was being guided by his father, Joseph P. Kennedy, a pro-Nazi sympathizer. But in December 1961, Joseph Kennedy suff ered a stroke that left him totally incapacitated. His son now held the nation’s highest offi ce with no real control over him. By mid-1963, Kennedy was beginning to exert his autonomous infl u- ence over the most powerful—and violent—groups in U.S. society. He w as threatening to disband the CIA, the homebase of many Nazis; withdraw U.S. troops from South Vietnam; close the tax breaks of the oil-depletion allowance; tighten control over the tax-free foreign assets of U.S. multinational corporations, many with connections to the Bormann e mpire; and decrease the power of both Wall Street and the Federal Re - serve System.

Th e C IA, which had passed hundreds of millions of dollars to the Nazi Gehlen Organization, has long been fingered as a major player in the assassination. Operatives such as future Watergate burglars E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis; CIA offi cer Desmond FitzGerald; mobster Johnny Roselli; Cuban minister Dr. Rolando Cubela; defrocked New Orleans priest David Ferrie; and anti-Castro Cubans Carlos Bringuier, Orlando Bosch, and Carlos Prio Soccaras all played roles in the CIA/in- telligence mix surrounding the assassination. But more pointedly, George DeMohrenschildt, a Dallas oil geologist wh o was the last known close friend to accused assassin Lee Harvey Os - wald, began his intelligence career as a Nazi agent. According to one CIA d ocument, DeMohrenschildt had applied to work for U.S. intelligence as far back as 1942 but was turned down because he was a Nazi espionage agent. His cousin, Baron Constantine Maydell, was one of the top Nazi intelligence agents in North America and, aft er the war, was recruited into the Gehlen Organization to direct the CIA’s Russian émigré pro - grams. At the same time DeMohrenschildt was befriending Oswald in Dallas a nd introducing him to the White Rus sian émigré community there, in which the Gehlen Organization was well represented, he was in close con - tact with his friend J. Walter Moore, an agent of the CIA’s Domestic Co ntacts Division. In 1957, following a trip to Yugo slavia, according to CIA documents, DeMohrenschildt provided the agency with “foreign intelligence which was promptly disseminated to other federal agencies in ten separate reports.” Oswald’s other close associates in Dallas just prior to the assassination w ere Ruth and Michael Paine. Oswald’s wife was staying in the Paine home at the time of the assassination and it was Ruth Paine, a woman with CIA connections, who got Oswald his job at the Texas School Book Depository.

Oswald’s own connections to the CIA are well documented—his tr aining at Japan’s Atsugi base, which housed a large CIA facility, his incredible ability to speak fl uent Russian despite lack of evidence of lan - guage lessons, testimony of his CIA employment by fellow marines and a fo rmer CIA paymaster, his ease in obtaining U.S. passports, his use of the word “microdots” in his diary, and his possession of a miniature Minox “spy” camera with a serial number proving it was not commercially avail - able in America. Th e m ost oft en pointed out, and controversial, evidence of the involve - ment of both Nazi mentality and actual Nazis in Kennedy’s assassination ca n be found in a treatise passed around for years under the name “Torbitt Document” or “Nomenclature of an Assassination Cabal.” Th is docu - ment first appeared under the pen name of William Torbitt but was actu - ally written by a Texas attorney named David Copeland. Copeland told thi s author he had received the information from friends in both the FBI and the Secret Service. Based on this information, Torbitt/Copeland spent considerable eff ort searching for evidence to support the paper’s thesis. According to the “Torbitt Document,” the Kennedy assassination was o rchestrated through a nexus of Nazi-infiltrated anticommunist organi - zations, elements of the military-industrial complex, the CIA, and the F BI. Torbitt explained, “Th e director of the Federal Bureau of Investiga - tion was in charge of NASA’s Security Division and the Defense Industrial Se curity Command [DISC] in his position as head of counterespionage activities in the United States. His agents investigated every employee of the space agency as well as the employees of the pertinent contractors do - ing business with NASA and also prospective employees of every arms a nd munitions manufacturer.

Edgar Hoo - ver, and Canadian L. M. Bloomfi e ld in directing activities of the munition-makers’ police agency, the Defense Industrial Security Com - mand. During this time, Walter Sheridan, who later became NBC’s s pecial investigator used to undermine the New Orleans assassination investigation of District Attorney Jim Garrison, was a direct liaison be - tween Carroll and Robert F. Kennedy. Hoover worked directly with W ernher von Braun in connection with NASA’s security and it was Lyndon Johnson who, as vice president, served as chairman of NASA. Johnson, along with von Braun, Bobby Baker, and Fred Black worked hard to obtain the $9 billion Apollo contract for North American Avia - tion in 1961 [North American, which, among other famous aircraft , p roduced the F-86 Sabre jet based on the Nazi Focke-Wulf Ta-183, to - day is part of the Boeing Company]. North American won the NASA c ontract despite the fact that its own source evaluation board had rec - ommended another company. According to Torbitt, each of the NASA security personnel who were a ssigned duties in connection with the assassination were employees or contractees for Division Five of the FBI. “It must be borne in mind that this was a relatively small group within all of these agencies. It was not of - ficia l, and it was not an American operation, but was simply the indepen - dent action taken by these men, some of whom happened to hold offi cia l positions,” he wrote. Torbitt’s tale of a NASA conspiracy was supported by New Orleans Dis trict Attorney Jim Garrison, who was investigating the Kennedy as - sassination. In 1968, Garrison telephoned magazine editor Warren H inkle to say, “Important new evidence has surfaced. Th ose Texas oil - men do not appear to be involved in President Kennedy’s murder in the w ay we first thought. It was the military-industrial complex that put up the money for the assassination—but as far as we can tell, the conspiracy was limited to the aerospace wing.

Amazingly enough, accused assassin Oswald told New Orleans garage own er Adrian Alba that he expected to soon work at a New Orleans plant of NASA. Why Oswald, who had tried to defect to Rus sia and voiced hostility toward the USA and its policies, thought he could go to work for the nation’s leading aerospace agency was never explained. According to the Torbitt document, this complex matrix of govern - ment agents, NASA employees, and Nazis was managed by Louis Mor - timer Bloomfield of Montreal, Canada. According to Canadian newspaper ac counts, Bloomfi eld was an ardent Zionist, an attorney, businessman, and philanthropist who had worked for the OSS during World War II and for the fl edgling CIA. Torbitt stated Bloomfi eld was a longtime friend and confi dant of J. Edgar Hoover and had been Hoover’s contract supervisor of Division Five since his days in the OSS before World War II. Torbitt said Bloomfi eld “was the coordinator of all activities, responsible only to Hoover and Johnson in carrying out the plans for John Kennedy’s assassination.” In 1967, New Orleans DA Jim Garrison charged Clay Shaw, a former OS S officer and founder of the city’s International Trade Mart, with con - spiracy to assassinate the president. According to several separate so urces—including Garrison’s files and an investigation by the U.S. Labor Party—the International Trade Mart in New Orleans was a subsidiary of a shadowy entity known as the Centro Mondiale Commerciale (CMC) or World Trade Center, which was founded by Bloomfi eld in Montreal in the late 1950s, then moved to Rome in 1961. The Trade Mart was con - nected with CMC through yet another shadowy firm named Permindex ( PERManent INDustrial EXpositions), also in the business of interna - tional expositions. According to Torbitt, Bloomfi el d held half of the shares of Permindex and was in total command of its operation in Europe and Africa as well as the North and South American continents. (In the 1962 edition of Who’s Who in the South and Southwest, Shaw gave bio - graphical information stating that he was on the board of directors of P ermindex. However, in the 1963–64 edition, the reference to Permindex was dropped.)"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"226 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH In the late 1960s, both Permindex and its parent company, Centro Mondiale Commerciale, came under inte nse scrutiny by the Italian news media. It was discovered that Prince Gutierrez di Spadaforo was on the board of CMC. Th e prince was a wealthy aristocrat who had been under - secretary of agriculture under the dictator Benito Mussolini, and whose d aughter-in-law was related to Nazi minister of finance Hjalmar Schacht; Carlo D’Amelio, an attorney for the former Italian royal family; and Fer - enc Nagy, former premier of Hungary and a leading anticommunist. Th e I talian media reported that Nagy was president of Permindex, and the board chairman and major stockholder was Louis Mortimer Bloomfi eld, the powerful Montreal lawyer who represented the Bronfman family as well as serving U.S. intelligence services. Reportedly, Bloomfi eld estab - lished Permindex in 1958 as part of the creation of worldwide trade cen - ters connected with CMC. According to a special investigation by reporters David Goldman and Je ffrey Steinberg in their 1981 book Dope, Inc.: Britain’s Opium War Against the U.S., Bloomfi eld was recruited into the British Special Opera - tions Executive (SOE) in 1938, during the war was given rank within the U.S. Army, and eventually became part of the OSS intelligence system, i ncluding the FBI’s Division Five, where he became quite close with J.

Whatever the truth behind Centro Mondiale Commerciale and its c ompanion company Permindex, and their connection to Kennedy’s as - sassination, the Italian government saw fi t t o expel both firms in 1962 for subversive activities identical to those in the much-publicized Propa- ganda-2 (P-2) Masonic Lodge scandal of the Reagan years. Today it is clear that Clay Shaw was tightly connected to the CIA and i ntelligence work despite his denials at the time of the Garrison investiga - tion. It is interesting to note that while serving in the U.S. Army during W orld War II, Shaw worked as aide- de- camp to General Charles O.

It wasn’t Castro or the Rus sians. Th e men who killed Mr. Kennedy were CIA contract agents. John Kennedy’s murder was a two-part conspiracy murder.

It had to happen. Th e man was too independent for his own good.” No serious assassination researcher truly believes that Kennedy was k illed solely by German Nazis. But, as previously reported, men with Nazi connections—before, during, and aft er World War II—who were also members of secret societies, were most opposed to Kennedy’s policies. Th ey also had the power and infl uence to aff ect such an assassination and cer - tainly were capable of blocking any meaningful investigation—whether b y government or the media—right up to today.

McCloy and Allen Dulles, both men, as we have seen, with close Nazi connections, along with Gerald R. Ford, who was spying on the commis- sion for J. Edgar Hoover. As noted by Professor Donald Gibson of the University of Pittsburgh, “B oth of these men [McCloy and Dulles] had always been the Establish- ment’s men in government; they were not the government’s men in the Establishment . . . . When McCloy served as a high commissioner in Ger - many or as president of the World Bank or as a member of the so- called W arren Commission, he did so as a servant of that ruling elite. His most extensive ties to that elite were to various Rocke feller family interests. Th e"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"KENNEDY AND THE NAZIS 229 other leading fi gure on that commission, McCloy’s longtime close friend Allen Dulles, was also a man of the Establishment, even though his name is almost always associated with the CIA.” In his 1994 book Bat tling Wall Street: The Kennedy Presidency, Gibson made a cogent argument that the primary factor behind the JFK assassi - nation was that he was at loggerheads with the Wall Street Establishment, t hose same globalist financiers who first promoted communism and then National Socialism. Prior to the Reagan administration, the Senate Committee on Govern - mental Aff a irs in 1980 produced a study titled “Structure of Corporate Concentration.” Gibson decribed it as “the most thorough investigation of institutional stockholders and of connections among boards of directors that has ever been done” and wrote, “Th e basic conclusions [of this study ] are concise and quite straightforward: financial institutions, part of, or ex - tensively interrelated with, the Morgan-Rocke feller complex, are the domi - nant force in the economy.” One example Gibson offered was that the “board of directors of Mor - gan included individuals serving on the boards of 31 of the top 100 firms. C iticorp was directly tied to 49 top companies, and Chase Manhattan, Chemical Bank, and Metropolitan Life each had 24 other top companies represented on their boards. Th ese and a multitude of other overlaps among the top 100 firms provides a dense network of relationships rein - forced by frequent ties through private clubs, educational background, ma rriages, and membership in organizations such as the Council on For - eign Relations and the Business Council.” Aft e r detailing how Kennedy sought to deny total control to this nexus of globalists, Gibson stated, “President Kennedy’s commitment to science, technology, and economic progress had led him to adopt policies that were vehemently attacked by people in and around the Morgan- Rocke fel ler complex.” It was less than two hours aft e r Kennedy was shot—at a time when the Dallas police were unsure of Oswald’s identity, since he carried identifi ca - tion in the names of two different persons—that J. Edgar Hoover wrote: “I ca lled the attorney general at his home and told him I thought we had the man who killed the President down in Dallas.” FBI documents"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"230 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH released in 1977 stated that Hoover had concluded that Lee Harvey Os - wald was the assassin and was “a mean-minded individual . . . in the cate - gory of a nut.” Th e e vening of the assassination, Hoover told Lyndon Johnson’s aide Walter Jenkins, “Th e thing I am concerned about . . . is having something issued so we can convince the public that Oswald is the real assassin.” Within days of Kennedy’s death, the same forces opposing his policies b egan to promulgate the offi cial theory for his death—a lone assassin suf - fering a “strain of madness and violence” fi red at the president from the s ixth fl oor of a book warehouse, striking him twice out of three shots fired within six seconds, despite the fact that the target was 265 feet away, mov - ing laterally and downhill away from the shooter, and an evergreen tree o bscured the line of sight. “Within a couple of days, Alan Belmont of the FBI was pushing the ‘ Oswald did it alone’ conclusion and shortly thereaft er McCloy and Du lles were settling the dust with the same conclusion,” wrote Gibson. Based on White House telephone transcripts released only thirty years aft er the assassination, Gibson noted a cohesive effort on the part of prominent people to push for a presidential commission that would cement the lone- assassin theory: “Between November 25th and 28th, LBJ was trans - formed from opponent of to promoter of a commission.

I N E A R LY 19 74 , while President Nixon was desperately trying to find a way out of impending impeachment, G. Gordon Liddy, ringleader of the break-in at the National Democratic Party headquarters, was preoccupied with Nazi imagery. Liddy had named the Watergate “plumbers” aft er that vast secretive organi zation that helped Nazis escape both Europe and jus - tice aft e r the war. “Our O rganization had been D irected to E liminate S ubversion of the S ecrets of the A dministration, so I created an acronym using the initial letters of those descriptive words [italics added]. ODESSA appealed to me because when I organize, I am inclined to think in Ger - man terms and the acronym was also used by a World War II German v eterans organization belonged to by some acquaintances of mine,” Liddy wrote in his 1980 book Will: Th e Autobiography of G. Gordon Liddy . According to author Edward Jay Epstein, in 1971, Liddy invited a n umber of White House offi cials to view Nazi propaganda films to “dem - onstrate how a few determined men could manipulate the emotions of an e ntire nation by invok ing a few hig h ly visua l symbols of fear.” Th ese Nixon offi cials included John Ehrlichman, Egil Krogh, Donald Santarelli, and Robert Mardian. “The cycle of films was climaxed on June 13 by the showing of Triumph of the Will, a Nazi propaganda film made under the auspices of Hitler and Goering, which graphically depicted the way a ‘na - tional will’ could be inculcated into the masses through the agency of c ontrolled fear and frenzied outrage,” reported Epstein. Paul Manning noted: “Th e G erman–South American group also had direct access to the Nixon White House through their representatives in Washington, and were proud of the fact that Bebe Rebozo was President Nixon’s closest friend. For, knowingly or unknowingly, Rebozo pro cessed"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"REBUILDING THE REICH, AMERICAN-STYLE 241 millions of their dollars through his Florida bank as part of normal com - mercial operations.” And it was during Nixon’s presidency that Prescott Bush’s son, George H erbert Walker Bush, one of the last of Nixon’s Republican loyalists, was named chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC). With Nixon’s resignation in August 1974, the United States entered a pe riod of further turmoil. Th e Church Committee uncovered conspira - cies, including assassination plots within the CIA, and recriminations s tarted, following the loss in Vietnam. Gerald Ford, a Republican insider, had been appointed vice president with the resignation of Spiro Agnew, who was under indictment for tax evasion. When Ford became president, he promptly pardoned Nixon of all crimes and, at the behest of his secre - tary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld, appointed George H. W. Bush to head th e CIA. At the time, most people could not understand Bush’s appointment, ha ving forgotten that his Nazi- connected grandfather, Senator Prescott Bush, had been one of those instrumental in establishing the CIA. Meanwhile, the globalists, realizing that the Republican Party in the w ake of Nixon’s resignation was politically vulnerable, were maneuvering to place a Democrat in the White House. Th ey created an outgrowth of the old Council on Foreign Relations called the Trilateral Commission. T HE CONCEPT OF the Trilateral Commission was brought to David Rocke feller in the early 1970s by Zbigniew Brzezinski, then head of the Rus sian studies department at Columbia University. While at the Brook - ings Institution, Brzezinski had been researching the need for closer co - operation between the trilateral nations of Europe, North America, and As ia. In a book titled Between Two Ages: America’s Role in the Technetronic Er a, Brzezinski foresaw a society “that is shaped culturally, psychologi - cally, socially, and economically by the impact of technology and el ectronics—particularly in the area of computers and communication.” He also declared, “National sovereignty is no longer a viable concept” and predicted “movement toward a larger community by the developing"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"242 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH nations . . . through a variety of indirect ties and already developing limi - tations on national sovereignty.” He saw this larger community being f unded by “a global taxation system,” similar to one that is now being pro - posed in the United Nations. Brzezinski’s plan for a commission of trilateral nations was first pre - sented during a meeting of the ultrasecret Bilderberg Group in April 1 972, in the small Belgian town of Knokke. Reception to Brzezinski’s proposal reportedly was enthusiastic. Th e Trilateral Commission was of - ficia lly founded on July 1, 1973, with David Rocke feller as chairman. Brzezinski was named founding North American director. North Ameri - can members included Georgia governor Jimmy Carter, U.S. Congress- man John B. Anderson (another presidential candidate), and Time Inc. ed itor in chief Hedley Donovan. Foreign founding members included Reginald Maudling, Lord Eric Roll, Economist editor Alistair Burnet, FIAT president Giovanni Agnelli, and French vice president of the Com - mission of Europe an Communities Raymond Barre. Even the establishment- oriented media expressed uneasiness over the p reponderance of Trilaterals in government in early 1977. Columnist William Greider writing in the Dallas Morning News noted: “But here is the unsettling thing about the Trilateral Commission. Th e president- elect [Carter] is a member. So is vice president–elect Walter F. Mondale. So are the new secretaries of state, defense and treasury, Cyrus R. Vance, Harold Brown and W. Michael Blumenthal. So is Zbigniew Brzezinski, who is a former Trilateral director and Carter’s national security advisor, also a bunch of others who will make foreign policy for America in the next four years.” Antony C. Sutton and Patrick M. Wood, authors of Tr i l a t e r - als Over Washington, c ommented, “If you are trying to calculate the odds of three virtually unknown men [Carter, Mondale, and Brzezinski], out of over sixty [Trilateral] commissioners from the United States, capturing the three most powerful positions in the land, don’t bother. Your calcula - tions will be meaningless.” Despite being a creation of the Rocke feller-dominated Trilateral Com - mission and following some of their aims, such as eliminating price con - trols for domestic petroleum production by establishing a national energy po licy and further drawing power to the federal government by creating"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"REBUILDING THE REICH, AMERICAN-STYLE 243 the departments of energy and education, Carter apparently failed to sat - isfy the globalists. Th e ma ss media were already focusing on conservative California gov - ernment Ronald Reagan as the man of the hour. Reagan’s nomination as G OP presidential candidate for the 1980 election seemed assured. Carter asked for and was granted a national television spot during p rime time, and many media pundits predicted that he was about to an - nounce sweeping changes in government as well as new initiatives that w ould move his upcoming presidential reelection campaign off high center. But before his televised appearance, Carter journeyed to Califor - nia, where he was to address a Hispanic crowd in the Los Angeles Civic Ce nter Mall celebrating Cinco de Mayo, the day the Mexicans defeated the French Army in 1862. A few days later, a handful of newspapers car - ried a small story stating that a “grubby transient” had been arrested there a nd was being held on suspicion of the attempted assassination of the president. A Secret Service spokesman downplayed the arrest, stating the incident was about as “nothing as these things get.” However, a few days later, another news item appeared, which reported th at the thirty-fi ve-year- old Anglo suspect was being held in lieu of $50,000 on charges of conspiring to kill the president. Finally, a one-time story in the May 21, 1979, edition of Newsweek revealed more details of the incident. According to the news magazine, the suspect was arrested aft er Secret Service agents noticed him “looking nervous.” A .22, eight- shot revolver was found on the man along with seventy rounds of blank ammunition. A short time later, the suspect implicated a second man, a twenty-one-year-old Hispanic, who also was taken into custody and sub - sequently held in lieu of $100,000 bail. Th e sec ond suspect at first denied knowing the other man, but finally admitted that the pair had test-fired the blank starter pistol from a nearby hotel roof the night before Carter’s appearance. Both men said they were simply local street people hired by two hit men who had come up from Mexico. Th ey were to create a d iver - sion with the blank pistol, and the two hit men were to assassinate Presi - dent Carter with high-powered rifl es . Lending credence to their story, both suspects led authorities to the s habby Alan Hotel located near the civic center. Here investigators found"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"244 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH an empty rifl e case and three rounds of live ammunition in a room that had been rented under the name Umberto Camacho. Camacho appar - ently had checked out the day of Carter’s visit. No further trace of the hit m en could be found. Th e A nglo suspect’s name was Raymond Lee Harvey and his Hispanic companion’s name was Osvaldo Ortiz. Th is oddity of their names prompted Newsweek reporters to state, “References to Lee Harvey Oswald and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy were unavoidable . . . . But,” they a dded, “it was still far from clear whether the authorities had a real con - spiracy or a wild goose chase on their hands.” No further news stories appeared, and the disposition of the case a gainst Lee Harvey and Osvaldo apparently has never been made public. A recent search of the federal prisoner database indicated no such persons are currently incarcerated. But apparently Carter got the message. He canceled his national TV sp eech and went into seclusion at Camp David. Aft er seeking advice from a lengthy line of con sultants, including the Reverend Billy Graham, Carter was reported to have said, “I have lost control of the government.” Backing away from any serious policy changes, Carter remained inde - cisive in the public eye. By mid-November the following year, the United S tates took a conservative turn and elected Republican Ronald Reagan. Reagan’s victory was due, in large part, to a failed military attempt to res - cue U.S. hostages held by Iranian radicals, followed by the collapse of ne - gotiations regarding their release in mid-October 1980. R EAG A N, A FOR M ER spokesman for General Electric Company, stocked his administrations with current and former members of globalist groups, the very people he had criticized while campaigning. During the 1980 presidential campaigns, Reagan verbally attacked the n ineteen Trilaterals in the Carter administration and vowed to investi - gate the group if elected. While competing against George H. W. Bush for t he nomination, Reagan lambasted Bush’s membership in both the Tri - lateral Commission and the CFR and pledged not to give Bush a position i n a Reagan government."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"REBUILDING THE REICH, AMERICAN-STYLE 245 Yet during the Republican National Convention, a strange series of events took place. With Reagan secured as the presidential candidate, there was a contentious fi ght to see who would be vice president. In midweek, national media commentators suddenly began talking about a “dream ticket” to be composed of President Ronald Reagan and Vice President (the former president) Gerald Ford. It was even suggested that since Ford had been president, he should choose half of the Reagan cabinet. Faced with the prospect of a split presidency, Reagan rushed to the con vention fl oor late at night and announced, “I know that I am breaking with pre ce dent to come here tonight and I assure you at this late hour I’m not going to give you my ac ceptance address tonight . . . . But in watching a t the hotel the television, and seeing the rumors that were going around and the gossip that was taking place here . . .

I have asked and I am recommending to this co nvention that tomorrow when the session reconvenes that George Bush be nominated for vice president.” For one brief moment, the power of those who control the corporate ma ss media was revealed. Reagan never again uttered a word against the globalist groups such as the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations. Following his election, Reagan’s fift y- nine- member transition team was composed of twenty- eight Council on Foreign Rela - tions members, ten members of the elite Bilderberg Group, and at least ten m embers of the Trilateral Commission. He even appointed prominent CFR members to three of the nation’s most sensitive offi ces—Secretary of State Alexander Haig, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, and Sec - retary of the Treasury Donald Regan. Additionally, he named Bush’s ca mpaign manager James A. Baker III, who then served as a chairman of the Reagan-Bush campaign committee, as his chief of staff . Baker is a fourth- generation member of a family long connected to Rocke feller oil interests."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"246 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Aft er Reagan won in November, it was alleged that Bush, along with CIA Director William Casey, had privately cut a deal with Iranian lead - ers to hold American hostages until aft e r the November election, thus as - suring a Reagan victory. Later testimony confirming this “October su rprise” came from several people involved, including Richard Brenneke and Heinrich Rupp, who claimed to have fl own Casey to a meeting with the Iranians and the Iranian foreign minister. Because of his damaging testimony, Brenneke was tried for perjury but found not guilty. Jury fore - man Mark Kristoff sta ted, “We were convinced that, yes, there was a meeting, and he was there and the other people listed in the indictment were there.” Despite this verdict, no action was taken by the Reagan-Bush administration, thanks primarily to debunking by a House Task Force led by Congressman Lee Hamilton, the same man Bush’s son would name to cochair his 9/11 Commission in late 2002. On January 20, 1981, claims of this “October surprise” conspiracy were f urther supported by the facts that just minutes aft er Reagan was sworn into offi ce, the American hostages were released, and within weeks, mili - tary supplies that Carter had withheld from Iran began moving to that n ation. Th en, just two months aft er taking offi ce in 1981, President Reagan was shot by would-be assassin John W. Hinckley, who exhibited the symp - toms of brainwashing and whose brother had scheduled dinner with Neil Bus h the very day Reagan was shot. For many weeks, while many Ameri - cans prayed for Reagan’s recovery, the son of Prescott Bush ran the nation. Bush had exerted his infl u ence to have Alexander Haig appointed sec - retary of state, and only days before the attempted assassination of Reagan ha d named Haig to head a special emergency preparedness committee. Haig, a ranking globalist member of the Council on Foreign Relations, was Nixon’s chief of staff from 1973 to 1974. It was Haig who finally ad - vised Nixon to resign. Haig was also NATO commander from 1975 to 19 79. Was it sheer coincidence that Hinckley’s brother had scheduled dinner w ith Bush’s son Neil the very night Reagan was shot, or that Hinckley’s father, a Texas oil man, and George H. W. Bush were longtime friends? It should also be noted that Bush’s name—including his then little- publicized nickname “Poppy,” which has caused many to wonder if this"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"REBUILDING THE REICH, AMERICAN-STYLE 247 referred to his parenthood or the narcotic plant—address, and p hone number were found in the personal notebook of oil geologist George De- Mohrenschildt, the last known close friend of Lee Harvey Oswald. Many researchers view these seemingly small, unconnected, and little-reported details as being beyond coincidence. Some saw Hinckley’s action as an at - tempt to bring Bush to power eight years before he was elected president. “Th is I bel ieve was a coup,” stated assassination researcher John Judge, cofounder of the Co alition on Political Assassinations (COPA). In a 2000 interview, Judge stated his belief that “loyalists won the concession that Reagan will be allowed to stay alive but Bush would come into power and at that point Haig emerged from the situation room to the press and said, his famous quote, ‘Gentlemen, I am in charge here until the vice president returns.’ Th at meant two things: number one, that they were going extraconstitutional—beyond the twenty- fift h amendment, a military takeover, and [number two] Haig in this offi ce of preparedness, prior to Bush, and basically he’s taking charge. Th e press was questioning, ‘What does this mean?’ What they don’t understand is all that constitution stuff is pushed aside once they declare national emergencies. Th en they go into FEMA and they have whole other orders of succession that have to do more with the military and the Pentagon than with any of the civilian sec - tor.” Constitutionally, the next in line in the order of succession is the vice p resident, then the speaker of the House, then the Senate president pro tempore, then the secretary of state. Vice President George H. W. Bush was fl ying from Texas at the time of Haig’s proclamation. Hinckley was whisked off t o Quantico Marine Base, then sent for psy - chiatric evaluation at Fort Butner, South Carolina, which Judge described a s “the first mind- control experimentation prison in the country.” All this time, Hinckley was under military control, not civilian. He was eventu - ally brought to court and declared not guilty by reason of insanity for the a ssassination attempt. “Th e pa tterns are always the same. You have a patsy that takes the blame. You have a second gunman that never comes to light. And you have an ascendance of power. Th at’s what I think happened aft er that point: that Reagan was basically allowed to function but Bush was presi - dent,” said Judge."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"248 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH And Bush was virtually unassailable, due to his hidden but powerful support base. Robert Parry, a former investigative reporter for the Associ - ated Press and Ne wsweek, noted: “Even when—or maybe especially when—Bush found himself in a corner on what appeared to be an obvi - ous lie, he was a master at turning the tables on his critics. Coming to Bus h’s defense was an impressive network of friends in high places. Th ey rarely failed him . . . . When that happened, it was wise not to ask too m any questions.” A NOT H E R I N DIC AT ION T H AT the Reagan administration may have been under the infl uence of fascists came in May 1985, when the president laid a wreath at a soldiers’ cemetery in Bittburg, Germany, where many Nazi SS offi cers were buried. It was also the former site of Bergen-Belsen con - centration camp. Although a hue and cry went up from veterans organiza - tions and Jewish groups prior to his visit, Reagan followed through with h is plan to honor war dead. In his remarks, he placed the blame for Nazi atrocities on “the awful evil of one man,” an obvious reference to Adolf Hitler. Th is effort to foist off all the blame for Nazism onto one person was perhaps an indication of the infl uence of pro-Nazi elements within his party. Meanwhile, throughout the 1980s, Republican Party leaders contin - ued their policy of bringing former Nazis and Nazi-minded foreigners i nto the party’s camp. According to investigative reporter Christopher Simpson, author of Blowback, Nazi émigrés brought into the USA by the CIA were placed in prominent positions within the Republican Party through “ethnic outreach committees.” Online Journal is a r eader-supported Web zine that was established in 1998 to “provide uncensored and accurate news, analysis and commen - tary.” According to their reporter Carla Binion, a convicted Nazi war col - laborator named Laszlo Pasztor served as an adviser to Republican Paul W eyrich, who founded the powerful conservative Heritage Foundation and is considered by many to be one of the founders of the “New Right.” Weyrich garnered large support by appealing to Christian fundamental - ists and anticommunists. Pasztor built up the GOP émigré network and"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"REBUILDING THE REICH, AMERICAN-STYLE 249 was founding chairman of the Republican Heritage Groups Council. Pasztor reportedly belonged to the Hungarian Arrow Cross, a group that helped liquidate Jews there during the war. Interestingly enough, Pasztor’s eff orts to make the Heritage Groups Council an eff ective branch of the GOP coincided with George H. W. Bush ’s term as head of the Republican National Committee. “A ft e r Nixon’s landslide victory in 1972, he ordered a general house cleaning on the basis of loyalty,” stated John Loft us and Mark Aarons in Th e Secret War Against the Jews . The authors quote Nixon as telling John Ehrlichman, “Eliminate everyone except George Bush. Bush will do any - thing for our cause.” Indeed, it was the elder Bush who fulfilled Nixon’s p ledge to make émigrés with Nazi backgrounds a permanent part of Re - publican politics. “It is clear that George Bush, as head of the Republican N ational Committee in 1972, must have known who these ‘ethnics’ really were,” the authors concluded. Based on the research of journalist Russ Bellant, author of the 1991 boo k Old Nazis, the New Right, and the Republican Party, other Nazi col - laborators involved with the Republican Party included: ◆ Radi Slavoff , executive director of the GOP’s Heritage Council and leader of “Bulgarians for Bush,” who was a member of a Bul - garian fascist group. Slavoff cr eated a Washington public event for writer Austin App, who in 1987 revealed his pro-Nazi sympa - thies by writing, “Th e tr uth is that in W W II, the Th ird Reich fought for justice, and the Allies fought to prevent justice.” ◆ Florian Galdau, who directed a Republican outreach program among Romanians and would head “Romanians for Bush” in 1988. Galdau was a supporter of Valerian Trifa, convicted of war crimes when he headed the Romanian Iron Guard in Bucharest. ◆ Nicholas Nazarenko, a former SS offi cer, who was the head of a Cossack Republican ethnic unit during the Nixon years.

Allan A. Ryan Jr., former director of the Justice Department’s Offi c e of Special Investigations, said he found Bellant’s reporting “well- documented and reliable.” Just weeks before the 1988 election, the W ashington Jewish Week re - vealed that several Nazis and Jew-haters were involved in the coalition s upporting Bush’s Republican campaign.

Yet, we can expect a higher degree of moral responsibility in their actions as men and as political leaders. Unfortunately . . . in the 1988 presidential campaign, George H. W. Bush was happy to accept support from a range of Nazis and Nazi- sympathizers in his quest for the White House, and was just as happy to keep them on in the administration even aft er they had been identifi ed as such.” Writing about a streak of anti-Semitism in the globalist individuals a nd companies that supported Hitler and continued to support Nazism even aft er the war, Levenda stated, “I believe that the entire racial theory of Nazism was a comfortable environment for these men.

Cheney and Rumsfeld, along with several dozen federal offi cials and one member of the cabinet, would travel to Andrews Air Force Base, usually in the middle of the night, and from there would pro - ceed to a remote location in the United States, such as a decommiss ione d military base or an underground bunker. Mann reported that “Cheney [Gerald Ford’s chief of staff a nd a former director of the CFR] was working diligently on Capitol Hill as a congress- man rising through the ranks of the Republican leadership. Rumsfeld, wh o had served as Gerald Ford’s secretary of defense, was a hard-driving business executive in the Chicago area—where, as the head of G. D. Searle and Company, he dedicated time and energy to the success of such com - mercial products as NutraSweet, Equal, and Metamucil. Yet for periods of t hree or four days at a time no one in Congress knew where Cheney was, nor could anyone at Searle locate Ru msfeld. Even their wives were in the dark; they were handed only a mysterious Washington phone number to use in case of emergency.” Cheney and Rumsfeld were involved in one of the most highly classi - fied p rograms of the Reagan administration, a program that called for setting aside the legal rules for presidential succession. Th is “continuity of government” program was created by a secret executive order from Reagan. According to Mann, one of the program’s participants told him, “One o f the awkward questions we faced was whether to reconstitute Congress aft er a nuclear attack. It was decided that no, it would be easier to operate without them. For one thing, it was felt that reconvening Congress, and replacing members who had been killed, would take too long.” Mann continued: “Within Reagan’s National Security Council the ‘ac - tion offi ce r’ for the secret program was Oliver North, later the central fi g- ure in the Iran- contra scandal. Vice President George H. W. Bush was g iven the authority to supervise some of these eff orts, which were run by a new government agency with a bland name: the National Program Offi ce.

When George H. W. Bush was elected president, in 1988, members of the secret Reagan program rejoiced; having been closely involved with the eff ort from the start, Bush wouldn’t need to be initiated into its intricacies and probably wouldn’t reevaluate it. In fact, despite dramatically improved relations with Moscow, Bush did continue the exercises, with some minor modifi cations.” Although the elder Bush gained his own time in the White House in 1 988, it was limited to one term due to the controversies and conspiracies swirling about him, not the least of which was his father’s pro-Nazi back - ground. It was to escape this heritage that, in 1949, young George had m oved from his ancestral home in Connecticut to the more receptive en - virons of Texas. During the Clinton administration, those who knew about the “conti - nuity of government” plan considered it an outdated relic. Th ou gh it was neglected, it was not abolished. Aft er September 11, 2001, the creators of this plan moved into action. Mann reported that, in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center under the White House, Cheney told President Bush to delay his planned flight back from Florida, while at the Pentagon, Rumsfeld instructed Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wol - fowitz to leave Washington for the safety of one of the underground b unkers. “Cheney also ordered House Speaker Dennis Hastert, other congressional leaders, and several cabinet members (including agriculture secretary Ann Veneman and interior secretary Gale Norton) evacuated to one of these secure facilities away from the capital,” added Mann. In the days following 9/11, the American news media finally men - tioned the existence of this “shadow government.” Of course, there was no m ention of the Nazi- connected globalists who had inspired it. “Th e ir [Cheney’s and Rumsfeld’s] participation in the extraconstitu - tional continuity- of-government exercises, remarkable in its own right, a lso demonstrates a broad, underlying truth about these two men,” Mann stated. “For three decades, from the Ford administration onward, even when they were out of the executive branch of government, they were never far away.

Rockwell, a former navy pilot during World War II and failed artist l ike his hero, Adolf Hitler, saw the telltale signs of conspiracy abroad in America, but, like Senator Joseph McCarthy and the more recent Holo - caust deniers, attributed it to “international communism” coupled with t he anti-Semitic view of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy. He formed vari - ous National Socialist political organizations and made headlines trying to conduct public rallies in various places. Rockwell, as well as the more recent Nazi skinheads, merely served to foc us public attention on these fringe elements of society and away from the military-industrial empire being created all around them. Th e U nited States has long been governed by men connected to secret societies such as the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission, both of which can be traced back to much earlier societies, like the previously mentioned Bavarian Illuminati and Freemasonry. Th ese groups can, in turn, be traced back to even earlier societies, such as the Knights Templar and Rosicrucians, which all had a particular interest in alchemy and the occult. As reported earlier, it was the right-wing Ger - man Th u le Gesellschaft , or Th ule Society, an off shoot of the Teutonic Knights, that formed the nucleus of the fl edgling Nazi Party. Whether or not the infamous Illuminati still exists, its credo “the end justifi es the means” lives on in the hearts of the corporate owners of today—globalists who value the blending of state and corporate power, the very definition of fascism. One organization that forms the connective tissue between these vari - ous secret groups may be the shadowy Bilderberg Group—powerful men a nd women, many of Europe an royalty, who meet in secret each year to discuss the issues of the day.

Th e name “Bilderberg” has been identifi ed with the Bilder - berg Hotel in Oosterbeek, Holland, where the group was first discovered, b ut some researchers claim the name was derived from an I. G. Farben subsidiary, Farben Bilder. Prince Bernhard was a director of Farben Bilder in the 1930s. Dutch prince Bernhard—full name Bernhard Julius Coert Karel God- f ried Pieter, prince of the Netherlands and of Lippe-Biesterfeld—was the primary impetus for the Bilderberg meetings. As previously noted, Bernhard was a former member of the Nazi Schutzstaff el, or Elite Guard, and an employee of Germany’s I. G. Farben in Paris. In 1937, he married Princess Juliana of the Netherlands and became a major shareholder and officer in Dutch Shell Oil, along with Britain’s Lord Victor Rothschild. In England, aft e r the war, Rothschild and Polish socialist Dr. Joseph Hieronim Retinger encouraged Prince Bernhard to create the Bilderberg Group, which began as unofficial meetings between members of Europe’s wealthy elite. Th e offi cial creation of this highly secret organization came about in the early 1950s, following discussions between Prince Bernhard and Dr. Retinger, a founder of the Europe an Movement after World War II. Retinger became known as the “father of the Bilderbergers.” Retinger was brought to America by Averell Harriman just aft er the war, when Harriman was U.S. ambassador to England. In America, Retinger visited prominent citizens, such as David and Nelson Rocke fel - ler, John Foster Dulles, and then CIA director Walter Bedell Smith, all m en with close connections to the Nazis. Previously, Retinger had formed the American Committee on a United Eu rope, working alongside future CIA director and CFR member Allen Dulles, then CFR director George Franklin, CIA offi cial Th omas Braden, and former OSS chief William Donovan. Donovan began his in - telligence career as an operative of J. P. Morgan Jr. and was known as an “ Anglophile,” a supporter of close British-American relations.

Another CIA-connected person who helped create the Bilderberg Group was Life magazine publisher C. D.

Th e c ommon denominator of these societies seems to be the acquisi - tion of money, which translates into power. Spencer Oliver, the ranking De mocratic Party leader whose telep hone was bugged as part of the Wa - tergate break-in, has stated, “The b iggest weapon in American politics is money, because you can use money to infl uence people, to infl uence the media, to infl uence campaigns, to infl uence individuals, to bribe people.” As has been seen, the fascist globalists have all the money. Th ey are where the buck stops . . . and begins. In 1991, then Arkansas governor Bill Clinton was honored as a Bilder - berg guest, and the next year he ran for and won the presidency of the U nited States. Aft er his election, Clinton made no mention of the Bilder - berg meetings. Hillary Clinton attended a meeting in 1997, becoming the fi rst American first lady to do so. Th ereaft er, talk steadily grew concerning her future role in politics, and by 2008 she was a leading Democratic presidential candidate. One illustration of globalist control within the Clinton administration ca n be found in the person of President Clinton’s treasury secretary Robert E. Rubin, a former cochairman of Goldman Sachs, who was named to head C linton’s National Economic Council. Despite Clinton’s promises to “re - form our politics so that power and privilege no longer shout down the v oice of the people,” according to Professor Donald Gibson, who lectures on wealth and power at the University of Pittsburgh and is author of Battling Wall Street, Rubin, in his capacity as council director, fought “to protect China’s preferred trading status, to protect employers’ interest in health-care reform, and to pursue a tougher policy in negotiations with Japan.” “At Goldman Sachs, Rubin had been involved in the kind of high-level pap er- shuffl ing that Bill Clinton has said was undermining the economy,”"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"REBUILDING THE REICH, AMERICAN-STYLE 257 Gibson wrote. “Goldman Sachs, along with Morgan Stanley, First Bos - ton, Dillon Read, and others had arranged corporate mergers and acquisi - tions costing hundreds of billions of dollars in the 1980s. Goldman Sachs a nd other investment banks were paid many millions of dollars to arrange these deals. For example, Goldman Sachs earned $10 million arranging U.S. Steel’s 1982 buyout of Marathon Oil. Rubin’s firm was paid $18.5 m illion for its role in the 1984 Texaco takeover of Getty Oil, and it was paid $15 million for facilitating General Electric’s 1986 acquisition of RCA/NBC. In other words, Rubin would seem to have been part of the problem.” In 2007, Rubin was vice chairman of the board of directors of the Co uncil on Foreign Relations.

Fletcher Prouty, a liaison offi ce r between the Pentagon and the CIA in the 1960s, was able to witness the control mechanisms over both intelligence and the military. Prouty said the United States is run by a “secret team,” answerable only to themselves. Th eir power is derived from their vast covert intragovernmental infrastructure and its direct connections with private industries, mutual funds, investment houses, universities, and the news media, including foreign and domestic publish - ing houses. Prouty would have been horrifi e d to learn that this “secret team” might include Nazis brought into the military-industrial complex aft er the war."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"258 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Another insider who confirmed that a plot was afoot was President Truman’s choice for America’s first secretary of defense, James V. Forre - stal, a man intimately connected with the globalists. Forrestal noted, “Th ese m en are not incompetent or stupid. Th ey are craft y and brilliant. Consistency has never been a mark of stupidity. If they were merely stu - pid, they would occasionally make a mistake in our favor.” Th e y do not make mistakes that favor the best interests of the Ameri- can people. Take, for example, the position assumed by the George W. Bus h administration toward the Rus sian Federation. Following the collapse of Communism, there was a splendid oppor - tunity to create new friendship and working arrangements with the e ighty-six political entities that comprise the new Rus sian Federation. No real negative mention was made of Rus sia during the Clinton years. Yet, suddenly, following the arrival of the Bush administration and the attacks of 9/11, Rus sia has been presented as a potential enemy and the United States has provoked hostility there by aggressive diplomatic and military maneuvers. “When the Cold War ended, we seized upon our ‘unipolar moment’ as t he lone superpower to seek geopolitical advantage at Rus sia’s expense,” noted conservative writer Patrick J. Buchanan. “Th ough the Red Army had packed up and gone home from Eastern Europe voluntarily, and Mos - cow felt it had an understanding we would not move NATO westward, w e exploited our moment. Not only did we bring Poland into NATO, we brought in Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, and virtually the whole War - saw Pact, planting NATO right on Mother Rus sia’s front porch. Now t here is a scheme afoot to bring in Ukraine and Georgia in the Caucasus, the birthplace of Stalin.” Others saw America’s reaction to Rus sian peace overtures as nothing l ess than aggression, perhaps a continuation of the National Socialist agenda of destroying the old Soviet Union. According to Mike Whitney of the Information Clearing House, a reader- supported Web information service, “Since September 11 [2001], the Bush administration has carried out an aggressive strategy to surround Russia with military bases, install missiles on its borders, topple allied regimes in Central Asia, and incite political upheaval in Moscow through U.S.-backed ‘pro-democracy’"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"REBUILDING THE REICH, AMERICAN-STYLE 259 groups.” It was also noted that it was Bush’s America, not Rus sia, that withdrew from the antiballistic missile treaty, a move that reminded some of the USSR’s Cold War–era public pledge never to be the first to use nu - clear weapons, a pledge never reciprocated by the United States. In mid-2007, such actions prompted federation president Vladimir Pu - tin to chastise the United States in a major press conference at the Forty- t hird Munich Conference on Security Policy. Putin’s reasoned remarks were little reported in the corporate-controlled U.S. mass media. “For the first time in history,” he said, “there are elements of the U.S. nuclear capa - bility on the Europe an continent. It simply changes the whole configura - tion of international security. . . . Of course, we have to respond to that.” C riticizing Bush’s “war on terror,” Putin also produced a copy of a report from Amnesty International and stated, “Th e or ga ni za tion has concluded that the United States is now the principal violator of human rights and freedoms worldwide.” Equally disturbing was Bush’s announced advocacy of an American fi rst-strike nuclear capability as well as his proposed “missile defense” sys - tem, which though defended as a deterrent to rogue nations, such as North K orea, nevertheless will be placed in Europe. Nobel Prize–winner Th o- mas C. Schelling of Harvard, an early advocate of the U.S. Mutual As - sured Destruction (MAD) Cold War strategy, which theorized that equal n uclear capability would deter a nuclear exchange, shift ed his rhetoric from “deterrence” to “compellence,” a newspeak term for blackmailing nations into submission through the threat of nuclear weapons. Pat Buchanan asked: “How would we react if China today brought C uba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela into a military alliance, convinced Mex - ico to sell oil to Beijing and bypass the United States, and began meddling in the aff airs of Central America and Carribbean countries to eff ect the electoral defeat of regimes friendly to the United States? How would we react to a Rus sian move to put anti-missile missiles on Greenland?” Some researchers saw this return to the Cold War by America as yet a nother sign that the global National Socialists have not given up on try - ing to coerce Rus sia, a nation only too familiar with socialist tyranny, into t heir New World Order.

B UT NOT ONLY the grandson of financier Prescott Bush, Nixon cronies, or the neoconservatives have shown sympathy for National Socialist ideals. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Austrian-born former bodybuilder turned act or turned governor of California, has a background of pro-Nazi state - ments and friends. In a 1977 interview, Schwarzenegger was asked which pe rson he admired. His response: “I admire Hitler, for instance, because he came from being a little man with almost no formal education, up to power. I admire him for being such a good public speaker and for what he did with it.” His admiration for Hitler may have come from sitting at his father’s k nee. In 1938, Hitler’s Nazis took control of Austria in an Anschluss, uni - fying that country with Germany. Arnold’s father, Gustav, one year later j oined Hitler’s infamous Sturmabteilung storm troopers (SA), known as the Brown Shirts. Gustav even sported a Hitler-like mustache. Schwarzenegger also caught fl a k because of his friendship with Kurt Waldheim, former secretary general of the United Nations, who lost the presidency of Austria in 1992, aft er his Nazi past was revealed.

Hitler realized that he needed the support of his wealthy conservative f ollowers, so he directed much of his public statements to them, particu - larly in the areas of rearmament and foreign policy. But his social pro - grams in many cases were a liberal’s dream come true. For example, gun control was already widespread in a pre-Nazi Europe u naccustomed to the freedom to bear arms. Anti–gun control advocates have long pointed out that it was an unarmed population that allowed the Nazis to both gain and maintain power. Ironically, the Nazis used the Weimar Republic’s gun-control laws—intended to restrict private armies such as Hitler’s SA—to keep the population disarmed. Hitler and his ilk were against keeping arms in the hands of citizens, es pecially conquered peoples. Hitler once declared: “Th e most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have al lowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the under - dogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty.” Still, the Nazis were not content with the stringent gun laws already on t he books. In 1938, they strengthened these laws by asserting that only loyal Nazis could own weapons. Th is was codifi ed in the Nazi Weapons Law of March 18, 1938. A group opposed to gun control, called Jews for the Preservation of F irearms Ownership, Incorporate ( JPFO), has made the shocking but well- supported argument that U.S. gun-control legislation is based on this Nazi law. “JPFO has hard evidence that shows that the Nazi Weapons Law (March 18, 1938) is the source of the U.S. Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA ’68),” stated the group on its Web site. “Th e N azi Weapons Law of 1938 replaced a Law on Firearms and Am - munition of April 13, 1928.

Th e Nazis used these inherited registration lists to seize privately held firearms from persons who were not ‘reliable.’ Knowing exactly who owned which fire - arms, the Nazis had only to revoke the annual ownership permits or de - cline to renew them.” Th e a ssassination of President John F. Kennedy precipitated a cry for gun control in the United States, and the corporate media went into high gear promoting this agenda. Yet, resistance was strong and the idea lan - guished until aft e r the 1968 murders of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4 and Robert F. Kennedy on June 6. Following these shocking deaths, the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA) was passed in October of that year, aft er strenuous debate and compromise. Some conspiracy researchers see this as a classic example of creating a problem, off ering a draconian solu - tion, and settling for a compromise that still fulfills the original agenda. Th e g un legislation of 1968 stated only licensed dealers could send and receive firearms across state lines, thus ending mail-order sales. It also allowed bureaucrats in Washington to decide what types of firearms Americans could own. Th e term “sporting” guns was not clearly defined, allowing whole classes of firearms to be banned. “Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA ’68, w e concluded that the framers of the GCA ’68—lacking any basis in American law to sharply cut back the civil rights of law-abiding Americans—drew on the Nazi Weapons Law of 1938,” stated JPFO lit - erature.

So at la st we find ourselves, as always, in a health- care crisis,” Dr. Smith wrote in 1984. Th is health- care crisis continues today. Rocke feller control over the medical establishment also was exercised t hrough the Rocke feller Sanitary Commission and the Rocke feller Insti - tute for Medical Research, at one time headed by Dr. Detlev Bronk, al - ready named as a suspected member of MJ-12. “Rocke feller’s General E ducation Board has spent more than $100 million to gain control of the nation’s medical schools and turn our physicians to physicians of the allo - pathic school, dedicated to surgery and the heavy use of drugs,” com - mented Mullins. Mullins also pointed to the Nazi connections of GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK), the second-largest pharmaceutical company in the world aft er Pfi zer.

Glaxo, a New Zealand firm that originally manufactured baby food, became Glaxo Laboratories and went multinational in1935. Aft er the postwar acquisition of other companies, including Meyer Laboratories, Glaxo moved its facilities to the United States. Burroughs Wellcome and Glaxo, Incorporate merged in 1995. The new name of the company was GlaxoWellcome. In 1830, John K. Smith opened his first pharmacy in Philadelphia. O ver the years, Smith, Kline and Company merged with the French, Richard and Company, and changed its name to Smith Kline and French Laboratories in 1929. By 1969, the firm had spread its business worldwide and purchased seven additional laboratories in Canada and the United States. In 1982, it merged with Beckman Incorporate, becoming Smith- Kline Beckman. With the 1988 purchase of its biggest competitor, Inter - national Clinical Laboratories, SmithKline Beckman grew by 50 percent. Th e la test merger took place with GlaxoWellcome in 2000, and the firm became GlaxoSmithKline. According to Eustace Mullins, the original Burroughs Wellcome drug fi rm was wholly owned by Wellcome Trust, whose director was the Brit - ish lord Oliver Franks. “Franks was ambassador to the United States from 1 948 to 1952,” Mullins wrote. “He [also was] a director of the Rocke feller Foundation, as its principal representative in En gland. He also was a di - rector of the Schroeder Bank, which handled Hitler’s personal bank ac - count; director of the Rhodes Trust in charge of approving Rhodes sch olarships; visiting professor at the University of Chicago; and chair - man of Lloyd’s Bank, one of En gland’s Big Five.” Recalling that John D.

For example, from 1908 to 1936, Farben withheld its discov - ery of sulfanilamide, an early sulfa drug, until the firm had signed work - ing agreements with the important drug firms of Switzerland, Sandoz a nd Ciba-Geigy. In one of the largest corporate mergers in history, these two firms joined in 1996 to form Novartis. It has been previously detailed how the support of globalists and trans - planted Europe an fascists helped put the Reagan-Bush team into power i n 1980. Against this background, it is instructive to look at one of the many controversial drugs now being used by millions of Americans— aspartame, an additive sugar substitute found in most diet soft drinks and more than fi ve thousand foods, drugs, and medicines. Aspartame is found in most sugar substitutes, such as NutraSweet, Equal, Metamucil, and Canderel. When heated to more than 86 degrees Fahrenheit—keep in mind t hat the human body temperature is 98.6 degrees—aspartame releases free methanol that breaks down into formic acid and formaldehyde in the body. Formaldehyde is a deadly neurotoxin. One quart of an aspartame-added beverage is estimated to contain about 56 miligrams of methanol. Dr. Louis J. Elsas explained to the U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources: “I am a pediatrician, a professor of pediat - rics at Emory, and have spent twenty-fi v e years in the biomedical science [s], trying to prevent mental retardation and birth defects caused by excess phenylalanine . . . . [I] have considerable concern for the increased dissemi - nation and consumption of the sweetener aspartame—1-methyl N-L-a-as pa rtyl-L-phenylalanine—in our world food supply. Th is artifi cial dipep - tide is hydrolyzed by the intestinal tract to produce L-phenylalanine, wh ich in excess is a known neurotoxin.” Countering claims that labora - tory tests indicated little harm from small amounts of aspartame, Dr. E lsas noted, “Normal humans do not metabolize phenylalanine as effi - ciently as do lower species, such as rodents, and thus most of the previous st udies in aspartame effects on rats are irrelevant to the question.” Before 1980, the Federal Drug Administration had refused to approve t he use of aspartame.

Aspartame also is blamed for the increase in diabetes as it not only can precipitate the disease but also stimulates and aggravates diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy, which, when interacting with insulin, can cause diabetics to go into convulsions. Dr. Betty Martini worked in the medical fi el d for twenty-two years. She was the founder of Mission Possible International, working with doc - tors around the world in an eff o rt to remove aspartame from food, drinks, and medicine. She gave this account of how pharmaceutical interests over - came claims of public welfare: “Donald Rumsfeld was CEO of Searle, that conglomerate that manu - factured aspartame. For sixteen years the FDA refused to approve it, not o nly because it’s not safe but because they wanted the company indicted for fraud. Both U.S. prosecutors hired on with the defense team and the statute of limitations expired. Th ey were Sam Skinner and William Con- lon. Skinner went on to become secretary of transportation, squelching the cries of the pilots who were now having seizures on this seizure- triggering drug, aspartame, and then chief of staff under President Bush’s father. Some of these people reached high places. Even Supreme Justice Clarence Thomas is a former Monsanto attorney. (Monsanto bought Searle in 1985, and sold it a few years ago.) When [ John] Ashcroft became attorney general [in 2001, Larry] Th ompson from King and Spalding Attorneys (another former Monsanto attorney) became deputy under Ashcroft . However, the FDA still refu sed to allow NutraSweet on the market. It is a deadly neurotoxic drug masquerading as an additive. It interacts with all antidepressants, L-dopa, Coumadin, hormones, insulin, all cardiac medi - cation, and many others. It also is a chemical hypersensitization drug, so it i nteracts with vaccines, other toxins, other unsafe sweeteners, like Splenda that has a chlorinated base like DDT and can cause autoimmune disease. It has a synergistic and additive eff ect with MSG. Both being excitotox - ins, the aspartic acid in aspartame, and MSG, the glutamate, people were fo und using aspartame as the placebo for MSG studies, even before it was approved. Th e FDA has known this for a quarter of a century and done nothing even though it’s against the law. Searle went on to build a Nutra- Sweet factory and had $9 million worth of inventory. Donald Rumsfeld was on President Reagan’s transition team and the day aft er [Reagan] took"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"270 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH offi ce he appointed an FDA commissioner who would approve aspar - tame.” Searle salesperson Patty Wood-Allott claimed that in 1981 Rumsfeld told company employees “he would call in all his markers and that no matter what, he would see to it that aspartame be approved this year.” Dr. Martini noted: “The F DA set up a board of inquiry of the best sci - entists they had to off e r, who said aspartame is not safe and causes brain tumors, and the petition for approval is hereby revoked. Th e new FDA commissioner, Arthur Hull Hayes, overruled that board of inquiry and then went to work for the PR agency of the manufacturer, Burson- Marstellar, rumored at $1,000 a day, and has refused to talk to the press ever since. Th ere were three congressional hearings because of the outcry of the people being poisoned. Senator Orrin Hatch refused to allow hear - ings for a long time. Th e fi rst hearing was in 1985, and Senator Hatch and others were paid by Monsanto. So the bill by Senator [Howard] Metzen - baum never got out of committee. This bill would have put a moratorium o n aspartame, and had the NIH do independent studies on the problems being seen in the population, interaction with drugs, seizures, what it does to the fetus, and even behavioral problems in children. Th is is due to the depletion of serotonin caused by the phenylalanine in aspartame.” Reagan’s FDA commissioner Hayes initially approved aspartame only a s a powdered additive. But in 1983, just before he left his position, he ap - proved the additive for all carbonated beverages. Attempting to study or report on aspartame is a thankless task for ma instream academics. Dr. Janet Starr Hull, an OSHA-certifi ed environ - mental hazardous-waste emergency-response specialist and toxicologist, i n 1991 was diagnosed with incurable Graves’ disease (a defect in the im - munization system that leads to hyperthyroidism) only to learn through h er own research that she had been poisoned by aspartame. She stated: “Many scientists at prestigious American universities will tell you they cannot get grants for continued research on aspartame or Splenda, or their department heads have been told to drop all discussions on the topic. Some will say aspartame research isn’t worth the eff ort because they can - not get published in American scientifi c j ournals. Others claim the re - search centers constructed by the large corporations, such as Duke"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"GUNS, DRUGS, AND EUGENICS 271 University’s Searle Research Center, were designed with managed research as a construction proviso.” Illustrating the battle between experts in regard to aspartame was the 2 005 research by Dr. Morando Soff ritti, scientifi c director of the Euro - pe an Ramazzini Foundation of Oncology and Environmental Sciences in Bo logna, Italy. Soff ritti conducted a three-year study on 1,800 rats and concluded that aspartame is a multipotential carcinogen. His work was peer-reviewed by seven world experts, and in April 2007, Dr. Soff ritti re - ceived the third Irving J. Selikoff A ward from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, where he presented a more recent study that confirmed the cancer- causing potential of aspartame at even small doses. He noted that only a small amount of aspartame can trigger cancer, and babies of mothers who ingested aspartame could grow up to contract can - cer. Other research conducted in Spain, such as the “Barcelona Report” by th e staff of the biology department of the University of Barcelona, con - firmed that aspartame transformed into formaldehyde in the bodies of l iving laboratory specimens and spread throughout vital organs. Th ese studies, largely unreported in the U.S. media, confirmed aspartame’s car - cinogenicity in laboratory rats. In 2006, media reports spoke of a “new study” that countered Soff ri tti’s research. Th is study was not new. It was actually conducted in the mid-1990s and reported that researchers could find no link between as - partame and cancer, according to Unhee Lim, PhD, a researcher at the N ational Institutes of Health (NIH). Lim and colleagues worked with 473,984 men and women between the ages of fift y and seventy-one who participated in this diet-and-health study. In 1995 and 1996, participants were asked how much they drank of three popular diet beverages—soda, fruit drinks, and iced tea. Th ey were also asked if they added aspartame to their coff ee and tea. From their answers, the researchers calculated how much aspartame they consumed on a daily basis. During the next fi ve years, 1,972 of those studied developed lymphoma or leukemia, and 364 developed brain tumors. When the researchers looked at people who con - sumed an average of at least four hundred milligrams of aspartame a d ay—about the amount found in two cans of soda—they found no link between aspartame consumption and cancer."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"272 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Critics noted that this study was subject to “recall bias,” since those in the study were being asked to remember what and how much they drank. “If their recollections weren’t accurate, it compromises the findings,” said Michael F. Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer watchdog organization. Th ere also was no consideration of the many other foods and additives that contained aspar - tame, which added to the daily intake. Yet, the few corporate mass media o utlets that carried the story in 2006 introduced the ten-year-old study with headlines such as “Findings May Help to Alleviate Concerns Raised by Rat Study Last Year.” Why such aversion by the media to dealing with controversial health issu es? According to the Center for Public Integrity (CPI), in the past seven years the pharmaceutical and health-products industry spent in ex - cess of $800 million to lobby legislators and government offi cia ls at both the federal and state levels. Manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and other health products spent nearly $182 million on federal lobbying from January 2005 through June 2006. “No other industry has spent more money to sway public policy,” stated a 2005 CPI special report titled “Drug Lobby Second to None.” “Its combined political outlays on lobbying and campaign contributions is topped only by the insurance in - dustry.” It should also be noted that the large pharmaceutical corporations an - nually spend nearly twice as much money on marketing as they do on re - search and development. In 2004, the CPI reported that pharmaceutical d irect-to- consumer advertising has grown from $791 million in 1996 to more than $3.8 billion in 2004. Drug ads on television are now ubiqui - tous. Th e cross- corporate ownership of both pharmaceutical houses, medical institutions, and the mass media, combined with the extraordinary amount of pharmaceutical advertising, might explain the media’s hesita - tion in reporting the deleterious eff ects o f drugs. According to Dr. Marcia Angell, former editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, profi t is the driving force behind medicine today. “In 2002 the combined profi ts for the ten drug companies in the Fortune 500 ($35.9 billion) were more than the profi ts for all the other 490 businesses put together ($33.7"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"GUNS, DRUGS, AND EUGENICS 273 billion),” she states. “Over the past two decades, the pharmaceutical in - dustry has moved very far from its original high purpose of discovering a nd producing useful new drugs. Now primarily a marketing machine to sell drugs of dubious benefit, this industry uses its wealth and power to co- opt every institution that might stand in its way, including the U.S. Congress, the FDA, academic medical centers, and the medical profession itself.” Dr. Angell, also author of the 2004 book Th e Truth About the Drug Companies: How Th ey Deceive Us and What to Do About It brings focus to the argument that the current power of the pharmaceutical in - dustr y can be directly traced to its phenomenal growth during the Reagan ye ars. “Th e el ection of Ronald Reagan in 1980 was perhaps the fundamental element in the rapid rise of Big Pharma—the collective name for the larg- est drug companies,” wrote Angell. Dr. Angell and a number of others t ook note of a strong pro-business attitude shift during the Reagan-Bush years—not just in government but within American society. Th e re was a time in the not-so-distant past when educated persons of class looked upon commercial businessmen only slightly more kindly than they had once looked upon theater folk. Th ey also had a slight dis - dain for enormous inherited wealth. Scientists, teachers, public servants su ch as firemen and policemen chose their careers for service and community- betterment rather than for lavish salaries and retirement bene - fit s. But times and attitudes change. Today, the corporate mass media portrays the race for wealth as practically virtuous. Th e wealthy are con - sidered winners while everyone else is a loser. “Th e g ap between the rich and poor, which had been narrowing since World War II, suddenly be - gan to widen again, until today it is a chasm,” remarked Dr. Angell. She went on to say that before 1980, pharmaceuticals was a good busi - ness, but aft e rward, it was a stupendous one. From 1960 to 1980, prescrip - tion drug sales were fairly static as a percentage of U.S. gross domestic pro duct, but from 1980 to 2000, they tripled. “Th ey now stand at more than $200 billion a year,” said Dr. Angell. “Of the many events that con - tributed to the industry’s great and good fortune, none had to do with the q uality of the drugs the companies were selling.” Th e su ccess of Big Pharma has more to do with marketing than with the"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"274 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH effi ciency of its drugs. Dr. Michael Wilkes described a recent pro cess called “disease-mongering.” Th is term is applied to large drug corpora - tions’ attempts to convince healthy people they are sick and need drugs. “Th is is a ll in an attempt to sell treatments,” explained Dr. Wilkes. “When their profi ts don’t match corporate expectations, they ‘invent’ new dis - eases to be cured by existing drugs.” Dr. Wilkes cited these examples of m edical conditions he considers disease-mongering: female sexual dys - function syndrome, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, toenail fungus, ba ldness, and social anxiety disorder (formerly known as shyness). He said these are but a few areas “where the medical community has stepped in, thereby turning normal or mild conditions into diseases for which medi - cation is the treatment.” Referring to the colossus that the pharmaceutical industry has be - come, Dr. Angell remarked, “It is used to doing pretty much what it w ants to do.” Beginning in the 1980s, important new laws were passed relaxing restrictions on pharmaceutical corporations. Th ese included the Bayh- Dole Act, after its chief sponsors, Indiana Democratic senator Birch Bayh and Kansas Republican senator Robert Dole. Th e Bayh- Dole Act allowed universities and small busine sses to patent discoveries from research underwritten by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the major distributor of tax dollars for medical research. It also allowed taxpayer-financed discoveries formerly in public domain, to be granted to drug corporations through exclusive licenses. Dr. Angell said that today universities, where most NIH-sponsored work is carried out, can patent and license their discoveries and charge royalties. Subsequent but similar legislation allows the NIH itself to directly transfer NIH discoveries to industry. Today, “all parties cash in on the public investment in research,” she noted. Under this system, research paid for by public money becomes a com - modity to be sold for profi t b y private concerns. Dr. Angell provides ex - amples of the large consulting fees paid by pharmaceutical corporations to i ndividual faculty members and to NIH scientists and directors, increas - ing the intrusion of the globalist pharmaceutical corporations into medi - cal education and the almost complete domination of medical education, pa rticularly when it comes to drugs. Recall that it was an NIH study that"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"GUNS, DRUGS, AND EUGENICS 275 refuted peer-reviewed research linking cancer to the sweetener aspar - tame. Approximately half of the largest pharmaceutical corporations are not A merican. About half of them are based in Europe. In 2002, the top ten were the American companies Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Wyeth (formerly American Home Products); the British companies GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca; the Swiss companies Novartis and Roche; and the French company Aventis (which in 2004 merged with another French company, Sanafi Synthelabo, and that put it in third place). “All are much alike in their operations. All price their drugs much higher here than in other markets,” stated Dr. Angell. Th e l ucrative connection between Big Pharma and medical schools and hospitals has brought about a definite corporate-friendly atmosphere. “One of the results has been a growing pro-industry bias in medical research—exactly where such bias doesn’t belong,” argues Dr. Angell. She also blasted pharmaceutical corporations for their claims that high d rug prices are necessary to fund research and development. “Drug indus- try expenditures for research and development, while large, were consist - ently far less than profi t s. For the top ten companies, they amounted to only 11 percent of sales in 1990, rising slightly to 14 percent in 2000. Th e biggest single item in the budget is neither R&D nor even profi ts but something usually called ‘marketing and administration’—a name that varies slightly from company to company. In 1990, a staggering 36 percent of sales revenues went into this category, and that proportion remained about the same for over a decade. Note that this is two and a half times the expenditures for R&D.” Dr. Angell further noted what many people see as excessive salaries of p harmaceutical executives such as Charles A. Heimbold Jr., the former chairman and CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb, who made $74,890,918 in 2001. Th is does not count his $76,095,611 worth of unexercised stock op - tions. During this same time, John R. Staff ord , chairman of Wyeth, made $40,521,011, not counting his $40,629,459 in stock options.

Th e ex cesses of the globalists’ pharmaceutical corporations have prompted many Americans to seek price relief by traveling to Canada or Mexico to purchase drugs. Dr. Angell concluded that only an aroused American public can rein in t he power of the pharmaceutical monopoly. Noting that drug companies have the largest lobby in Washington, and they give copiously to political campaigns, Dr. Angell said legislators and the mass media corporations are now so dependent on the pharmaceutical industry for campaign con - tributions and advertising that it will be exceedingly diffi c ult to break their power. “But the one thing legislators need more than campaign con - tributions is votes. Th a t is why citizens should know what is really going on . . . . there will be no real reform without an aroused and determined p ublic to make it happen,” she said. I F A SPA RTA M E I S not worry enough, a 2007 report by Peter Piper, a pro - fessor of molecular biology and biotechnology at Britain’s Sheffi e ld Uni - versity, stated that sodium benzoate, a mold-prevention substance used r outinely by the $160 billion soft - drink industry, creates the carcinogen benzene when mixed with vitamin C in drinks. Worse yet, according to Piper, “These chemicals have the ability to cause severe damage to DNA in the mitochondria to the point that they totally inactivate it: they knock it out altogether. . . . there is a whole array of diseases that are now be ing tied to damage to this DNA—Parkinson’s and quite a lot of neuro-degenerative diseases, but above all the whole pro cess of aging.” Th is r eport intensifi ed the controversy over chemical food and drink additives that have been linked to hyperactivity in children. One British news report on sodium benzoate quoted the makers of Coca-Cola, Pepsi Max, and Diet Pepsi, which all contain sodium benzoate, as saying they entrusted the safety of additives to the government.

W H I L E T H E FA SCIS T globalists took swift charge of Nazi drug technol - ogy aft e r the war, it is most interesting that they neglected a little-known and little-publicized aspect of the Th ird Reich—the fi ght against cancer, tobacco, alcohol abuse, and occupational hazards. In fact, the National Socialists’ predilection for health foods and pre - ventative medicine may have been yet another reason the globalists turned a gainst Hitler and his regime. Aft er all, most food additives, colorings, and preservatives are petrochemicals, and any decrease in human con - sumption would spell loss of profi ts t o the globalists’ corporations. Early on, the Nazi regime instituted policies designed to create healthier envi - ronments within the workplace. However, as the imperatives of wartime p roduction grew, these measures lost priority. One example of globalist neglect of Nazi science can be seen in the is- sue of asbestos. By the late 1930s, Nazi Germany had firmly documented t he link between asbestos and lung cancer. Th is connection was fl atly stated in a 1939 textbook, and by 1943 the Nazi government had recognized asbestos-induced cancer as a compensable occupational disease. Th is Nazi research would be used in later years to counter asbestos producers’ claims that they were unaware of the danger of asbestos until modern studies. “Th e n et eff ect in the fi eld of cancer research was to slow recognition of the asbestos hazard,” noted author Robert N. Proctor, a professor of the history of science at Pennsylvania State University and author of Th e Nazi Wa r o n C a n ce r . “Th e consensus achieved in Germany in the early 1940s"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"278 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH would not [be] obtain[ed] in Britain or the United States until more than two decades later. Science and political stigma [and commercial obsti - nacy] thus conspired—at least for a time—to confine the truth to the sha dows.” In addition to confining occupational health hazards to the shadows i n corporate America, the owners of the U.S. tobacco industry fought a successful, decades-long rearguard action against the claims that ciga - rettes are a leading cause of cancer. Utilizing one hired expert aft er an - other, they bought time while they diversifi e d their own ership away from tobacco. Contrary to the popular belief that the link between smoking and can - cer was demonstrated in postwar Britain and America, “it was in Ger - many in the late 1930s that we fi rst fi nd a broad medical recognition of bo th the addictive nature of tobacco and the lung cancer hazard of smok - ing,” according to Proctor. The N azis were among the first to ban smoking in public places such as Nazi party offi ces, post offi ces, hospitals, rest homes, and waiting rooms—a restriction today becoming prevalent across America. In 1938, the Nazi Luft waff e barred all smoking on its proper - ties. As in modern America, limitations were placed on tobacco advertis - ing. Much of the attack on alcohol and tobacco stemmed from the Nazi i deals of racial hygiene and Aryan purity. But it also was well supported by German science. Although the connection between smoking and cancer has been theo - rized for many years, it was the German physician Fritz Lickint who b rought the connection to public knowledge with the publication of his 1939 opu s Tabak und Organismus, or “Tobacco and the Organism.” In 1940, Lickint, described as “most hated by the tobacco industry,” escaped persecution by the Nazis for belonging to the Social Democratic Party, thanks to offi cial Nazi support for his antitobacco work. As in America from the 1960s to the 1980s, German tobacco inter - ests formed organizations and hired various experts to counter the cla ims of antitobacco activists. As in America, they claimed that the medical evidence against tobacco was “unscientifi c” and the propaganda of health fanatics. But it was an uphill fight, considering the amount of"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"GUNS, DRUGS, AND EUGENICS 279 scientifi c data then available, plus the fact that Hitler disdained tobacco and alcohol. In the widespread National Socialist eff o rt to stamp out both smoking and drinking, it was continually pointed out that Hitler neither smoked nor drank. Hitler would not permit his lover, Eva Braun, or his deputy, Martin Bormann, to smoke in his presence. Once, Hitler even suggested that to - bacco was “the wrath of the Red Man against the White Man, vengeance fo r having been given hard liquor.” It was also publicly noted in wartime propaganda that while Hitler, Mussolini, and Franco were nonsmokers, Churchill, Roo sevelt, and Stalin all smoked cigarettes, cigars, or a pipe. Th e attack on tobacco also has been traced to economic concerns. Th e Nazis, like modern American corporations, came to realize that tobacco-related illnesses could impact the hospital industry as well as the insurance industry. Th is concern, coupled with the increasing demands for healthy wartime workers, undoubtedly was an added stimulus for the antitobacco campaign. It is ironic to learn that some of the Nazis’ most ardent antismoking a ctivists, such as Karl Astel, director of Jena University’s Institute for To - bacco Hazards Research, who committed suicide in 1945, were also viru - lent anti-Semites and supporters of euthanasia. Th is is a fa scinating example of how social idealism can be subverted for tyrannical purposes. As Proctor noted, “[T]here is the fact that many of Germany’s leading antitobacco activists were also war criminals.” T HE N A ZIS ’ CONCER N over rising cancer rates also resulted in a bizarre confrontation over the use of X-rays. “Th e SS radiologist Hans Holfelder, who spearheaded an ambitious drive to X-ray hundreds of thousands of Germans, was trying to identify illness so steps could be taken to treat or isolate affl icted individuals,” reported Proctor. “[Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human Genetics and Eugenics founding di - rector] Eugen Fischer’s concern in warning against overexposure was the l onger-term ‘genetic health of the race.’ Both were solid Nazis, but the two had very diff erent conceptions of how to preserve the health of the favored race.”"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"280 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH One of the only Jewish cancer researchers allowed to continue working during the Nazi regime was Nobel laureate, biochemist Dr. Otto War - burg, a relative of the banking family and director of Berlin’s Kaiser Wil - helm Institute for Cell Physiology. Warburg’s institute was founded in 1 931, following a substantial donation by the Rocke feller Foundation to the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft , today known as the Max Planck Insti - tute. More than forty years ago, Dr. Warburg gave a lecture describing both t he cause and cure for cancer. “Summarized in a few words, the prime cause of cancer is the replacement of the respiration of oxygen in normal body cells by a fermentation of sugar. All normal body cells meet their energy needs by respiration of oxygen, whereas cancer cells meet their en - ergy needs in great part by fermentation. All normal body cells are thus o bligate aerobes, whereas all cancer cells are partial anaerobes . . . . Oxygen g as, the donor of energy in plants and animals, is dethroned in the cancer cells and replaced by an energy-yielding reaction of the lowest living forms, namely, a fermentation of glucose.” In other words, while most living cells require oxygen to live, cancer cel ls can do well without oxygen, instead drawing energy from the fer - mentation of sugars. To maintain normal health, humans require a mini - mum of 22 percent oxygen in the air they breathe.

If Dr. Warburg is correct, and he sta ted that “on the basis of anaerobiosis there is now a real chance to get rid of this terrible disease,” it is astounding that nothing has been done to cure cancer in the intervening four decades. Perhaps this is because, as has been pointed out by suspicious researchers, more people are making a liv - ing off ca ncer than dying from it. Meanwhile in America, Rocke feller executive Frank Howard, aft er c onvincing Alfred Sloan and Charles Kettering of General Motors to fund a cancer institute, was named chairman of the new Sloan-Kettering Institute.

Later, Howard represented Rocke feller interests in the drug company Rohm and Haas. I T I S I N T R IGU I NG that in modern health-conscious America, very little has been done to educate citizens about the dangers of overly prescribed drugs, including the depressant alcohol. During the Th i rd Reich, there was even a substantial antialcohol move - ment in beer-loving Germany, including a sizeable German Antialcohol - ism Association with a membership numbering in the thousands. Th e N azis outlawed alcohol advertising aimed at youth, as well as any that sug - gested alcohol was healthful. Alcohol-related hazards such as cirrhosis of t he liver, cardiomyopathy, fetal abnormalities, and esophageal cancer were well known even prior to the rise of National Socialism but mostly ig - nored in modern America’s pop ular media. Yet, like Prohibition in Amer - ica, the Nazi antialcohol eff o rt largely failed, due to the pressure for consumption from a thirsty population, coupled with the sizeable amounts of money gained by the government through taxes on alcohol. Like Americans today, the Nazis introduced a variety of nonalcoholic b eers and even produced some made from liquefi ed vegetables. In 1936, a certifi cation system was instituted, designed to protect children from “un - suitable” drinks. Coca- Cola was declared one such beverage due to its sug ar and additives. In fact, today’s “New Age” issues echo aspects of National Socialism in t he Th ird Reich. In addition to high-ranking Nazis’ fascination with the occult, organic foods, herbs, and healing plants were all encouraged in Nazi Germany, along with a “back to nature” idealism and respect for the rural life. “From 1934 to 1937, the amount of land devoted to herbs and healing plants . . . increased by more than a factor of ten—from 820 hec - tares to 3,896 hectares,” noted Proctor. “Cultivation was especially strong i n the forests of Th uringia and north-central Germany, but every part of the country was involved.

But there’s one thing I can predict to eaters of meat: the world of the future will be vegetarian.” Many Germans fol lowed Hit- ler’s dream of a meatless society. About 83,000 voluntarily participated in his vegetarian- lifestyle program. But Hitler was also a consummate politician. Although he disdained bo th hunting and eating meat, he did not attempt to force his ideals on his followers, for purely pragmatic reasons. “Personally, I cannot see what possible pleasure can be derived from shooting . . . . I have never fired at a ha re in my life. I am neither poacher nor sportsman . . . . [But] if I excluded poach ers from the Party, we should lose the support of entire districts.” In viewing the reality behind benign, if tyrannical, government eff or ts at social control, Robert N. Proctor correctly concluded, “Th e Nazi cam - paign against tobacco and the ‘wholegrain-bread operation’ are, in some se nse, as fascist as the yellow stars [worn to identify Jews] and the death camps.

As previously noted, Th i rd Reich Nazis, as well as their prominent American business partners, were greatly interested in the fi eld of eugen - ics, the study of scientifi ca lly applied genetic selection to maintain and improve ideal human characteristics, which grew to include birth and population control. Th e concept grew from the writings of the Victorian scientist Sir Francis Galton, who aft er study reached the conclusion that prominent members of British society were such because they had “emi - nent” parents. In 1925, aft e r more than a decade in which at least sixty thousand “de - fectives” in the United States were legally sterilized, Justice Oliver Wen - dell Holmes, writing for the majority in a Supreme Court case, stated, “It is bet ter for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate off -"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"GUNS, DRUGS, AND EUGENICS 283 spring for crime or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can pre - vent those who are manifestly unfi t f rom continuing their kind.” Of course, to determine who was dirtying the gene pool required ex - tensive population statistics. In 1910, the Eugenics Records Offi ce was es- tablished as a branch of the Galton National Laboratory in London, e ndowed by Mrs. E. H. Harriman, the wife of railroad magnate Edward Harriman and mother of diplomat Averell Harriman. In 1912, Mrs. Har - riman sold her substantial shares of New York’s Guaranty Trust bank to J. P. Morgan, thus assuring his control over that institution. Aft e r 1900, the Harrimans, the family that gave the Prescott Bush family its start, along with the Rocke fellers, provided more than $11 million to create a eugen - ics research laboratory at Cold Springs Harbor, New York, as well as eu - genics studies at Harvard, Columbia, and Cornell. The first International C ongress of Eugenics was convened in London in 1912, with Winston Churchill as a director. Obviously, the concept of “bloodlines” was sig - nifi ca nt to these people. In 1932, when the Congress met in New York, it was the Ha mburg-Amerika shipping line controlled by Harriman associates George Walker and Prescott Bush that brought prominent Germans to the meeting. One leader was psychiatry professor Dr. Ernst Rudin of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Genealogy and Demography in Berlin. Ru - din was unanimously elected president of the International Federation of Euge nics Societies for his work in founding the Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Rassenhygiene, or the German Society for Racial Hygiene, a forerun - ner of Hitler’s racial institutions. Honored personally by Hitler in 1939 and 1944, Rudin continued to be ack nowledged as a leader in psychiatry. In 1992, the prestigious Max Planck Institute praised Rudin for “following his own convictions in ‘ra - cial hygiene’ measures, cooperating with the Nazis as a psychiatrist and h elping them legitimize their aims through pertinent legislation.” Despite much public renunciation of eugenics following the revelations o f the Nazi racial extermination programs at the Nuremberg trials, work continues right up to today, under more politically correct names.

According to Webster Tarpley and Anton Chaitkin, authors of Geor ge Bush: Th e Unauthorized Biography, “General Draper [in later years] founded ‘Population Crisis Committee’ and the ‘Draper Fund,’ joining with the Rocke feller and Du Pont families to promote eugenics as ‘population control.’ Th e administration of President Lyndon Johnson, advised by General Draper on the subject, began financing birth control in the tropical countries through the U.S. Agency for International De - velopment (USAID).” Draper also served as a population consultant to P resident George H. W. Bush, and he and his son were in charge of Bush’s campaign fund-raising in 1980. The younger Draper went on to work with population- control activities of the United Nations. Early eff or ts at reducing the birth rate by sterilization met with resis - tance in the United States, so the rhetoric was soft e ned and other means pursued. “Castration evidently hit a little too close to home for the aver - age member of the public to stomach,” wrote authors Jonathan Vankin a nd John Whalen, “so vasectomy became the preferred method for steri - lizing males, and its equivalent, salpingectomy, became the preferred steri - lization method for women.” Th e abo rtion controversy stems from the eugenics views of the globalist families and their belief that some form of population control must be al - lowed in a well-run soci ety. Th e Human Genome Project has only elevated fears that human DNA can be manipulated and controlled. Organizations such as the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, I ncorporated, a tax-exempt corporation that has 860 centers nationwide and claims to prevent more than 617,000 unintended pregnancies a year, are subsidized by the plutocracy, usually through their foundations and think tanks. In 2006, more than a third of the group’s contributions came from corporate and foundation grants. Rudin’s eugenics work was, in a large part, funded by Rocke feller mone y. “Th e plutocrats were in league with scientists, many with formida - ble reputations,” noted Vankin and Whalen. “Th ese sci entists expended immeasurable energ y trying to ‘prove’ that blacks were stupid, Jews were greedy, Mexicans were lazy, women were nutty, and so on—as well as the"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"GUNS, DRUGS, AND EUGENICS 285 corollary: rich, white people with good table manners and glowing report cards were ge ne tically superior.” General Maxwell Taylor, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff a nd U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam, who began addressing the Coun - cil on Foreign Relations in 1952, refl ect ed his fellow globalists’ viewpoint in a 1981 interview with Executive Intelligence Review . Taylor stated that the underlying cause of world problems was overpopulation. He said it would be necessary by the beginning of the twenty-first century to reduce the human population, mostly in Th ird World countries, by disease, star - vation, and regional conflicts. “I have already written off m ore than a bil - lion people.

But the real fear is to be found in the desire to control others, not in v oluntary population control or human genes. “[T]he twentieth century suff ered two ideologies that led to genocides,” said MIT cognitive scien - tist Steven Pinker, author of the 2002 book Th e Bl ank Slate .

An uneducated man, on the other hand, runs the risk of going over to atheism (which is a return to the state of the animal) as soon as he perceives that the state, in sheer op - portunism, is making use of false ideas in the matter of religion, wh ile in other fi elds it bases everything on pure science. Th at’s why I’ve always kept the Party aloof from religious questions.

Religion will have to make more and more concessions. Gradually the myths crumble. All that’s left is to prove that in nature there is no frontier between the organic and the inorganic. When understanding of the universe has become wide - spread, when the majority of men know that the stars are not sources o f light but worlds, perhaps inhabited worlds like ours, then the Christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity.

On July 23, 1933, just six months aft er he came to power, a Nazi-dominated National Synod in Wittenberg named a former German Army chaplain and virulent anti-Semite, Ludwig Muel - ler, as Reich bishop. Six months later, Mueller issued what came to be k nown as the “Muzzling Order,” a decree designed to bring control over the German Evangelical Church. Ministers were forbidden to speak about controversial or political matters; hence there could be no opposition to the Nazi regime. Mueller proclaimed that church services were “for the proclamation of the pure Gospel, and for this alone.” Th is same no-involvement-with-politics message can be heard in many churches in America today. Despite Nazi hostility to Christianity and thanks to Goebbels’s propa - ganda, many Germans believed that Hitler was heaven-sent. A Cologne c hildren’s prayer began, “Fuehrer, my fuehrer, bequeathed to me by the Lord.” And, with the notable exception of some anti-Nazi clerics such as Pastors Martin Niemoeller and the martyred Dietrich Bonhoeff er, the German congregations all fell into lockstep with the Nazi government. Many churchgoers were zealous Nazis, but many were simply hesitant or afraid to speak up against their noisy fellow members. “We will discover that the Nazi era shouts its lessons to the church of A merica,” concluded the Reverend Erwin W. Lutzer, senior pastor of Moody Church in Chicago, who made a detailed study of the National Socialists’ seduction of German Christians.

Th rough their corporate control over the large media outlets, these would-be global rulers have instituted a decades-long campaign to undermine and discredit organized religion, regardless of denomination. Some wayward TV evangelists and Catholic priests have only exacerbated this campaign. Th e re also appears to be a movement to control the church’s message in the campaign for the 2008 election. According to a June 2007 CNN press release, the TV network “will serve as the exclusive broadcaster of a presi - dential candidate forum on faith, values and politics during the Sojourn - ers ‘Pentecost 2007’ conference in Washington, D.C . . . .

Barack Obama to share their ideas and proposals about p ressing social issues with a special emphasis on poverty.” Soledad O’Brien, a CNN anchor and correspondent, was asked to moderate the forum. Jim Wallis in 1971 founded Sojourners, an organization that wishes “ to articulate the biblical call to social justice, inspiring hope and build - ing a movement to transform individuals, communities, the church, a nd the world.” Detractors accuse Wallis of attempting to divide evangeli - cal Christians to the benefit o f secular liberals. In an open letter, William J.

While Obama in early 2008 was criticized for intemperate remarks by h is former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, little attention was given to Hillary Clinton’s longtime active participation with a secretive Capitol Hill prayer and Bible study group known as “Th e Family” or “Th e Fellowship.” Ac - cording to an article by Barbara Ehrenreich posted on Th e Nation We b s i t e , a former member of Th e Family—Jeff Sharlet—described the group’s real work as “knitting together international networks of right-wing leaders, most of them ostensibly Christian.” Quoting Sharlet, reporter Ehrenreich wrote that in the 1940s, The Family reached out to former and not-so- former Nazis, and its fascination with that exemplary leader, Adolf Hitler, has continued, along with ties to “a whole bestiary of murderous thugs.” Considering Hillary’s ties to the secretive Bilderbergs, her husband’s m embership in the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Com - mission, as well as her work with the Nazi-connected group called Th e F amily, it could be said that she provides a connective tissue between the globalists and their new Fourth Reich.

Th at kind of separation is exactly what the church in Germany so desperately needed. “However, here in America the phrase ‘separation of church and state’ is g iven a sinister twist by civil libertarians.

Many hear the term ‘neocon’ and do not recognize that in its current operative sense, it is a term meaning ‘New World Order Fascist.’ ” Whole books have been written about the rise to power in America of t he “Religious Right,” a critical support base for the Republican Party. But most people appeared not to notice the parallels between the fascism of Nazi Germany and the conservative Christian movement in America today, both with deep roots in the conservative faction of the population. In America, this faction tends to be pro-business, which makes it a prime target of the fascist globalists, who largely control the corporate life of the nation. Th is faith-based political movement began in the late 1970s with the formation of the Moral Majority, a coalition of Christian conservative groups who were seeking to defeat President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 election.

Defeated in the primaries, Robert - son urged his fol lowe rs to vote for George H. W. Bush. Robertson went on to become an infl uential TV evangelist, primarily thanks to the Chris - tian Broadcasting Network he founded in 1961.

Only humans, with our free will, can choose to be deceitful. So to speak against the Holy Spirit is to distort, deform, or deny truth, an insight many politically conservative Christians seem to have missed.

Th e Nazis realized this only too well.” Upon close inspection, it will be found that the American education es tablishment has been created and guided for many years by the pro - genitors of the globalists who created both communism and National S ocialism. Th e o il magnate John D. Rocke feller created the General Education Board (GEB) in 1903 to dispense Rocke feller donations to education. By 1960, it had ceased operating as a separate entity and its programs were rolled into the Rocke feller Foundation. In 1917, the GEB made a $6 mil - lion grant to Columbia University to create the New Lincoln School, a p rivate experimental coeducational school in New York City. According to current school literature, the facility engages in “enrolling students from kindergarten through grade 12. Its pre deces sor was founded as Lin - coln School in 1917 by the Rocke feller-funded General Education Board a s ‘a pioneer experimental school for newer educational methods,’ under the aegis of Columbia University’s Teachers College.” According to Eustace Mullins: “From this school descended the na -"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"EDUCATION 297 tional network of progressive educators and social scientists, whose perni - cious infl u ence closely paralleled the goals of the Communist Party, another favorite recipient of the Rocke feller millions. From its outset, the Lincoln School was described frankly as a revolutionary school for the primary and secondary schools of the entire United States. It immediately discarded all theories of education that were based on formal and well-established disciplines, that is the McGuff ey Reader type of educa - tion, which worked by teaching such subjects as Latin and algebra, thus t eaching children to think logically about problems.” Other Rocke feller-connected entities that still shape the United States i nclude the Brookings Institution, the National Bureau of Economic Re - search, the Public Administration Clearing House, the Council of State G overnments, and the Institute of Pacifi c Relations. During the Carter administration, a former Rocke feller assistant, Paul Volcker, was named chairman of the U.S. Central Bank, the Federal Reserve System. John D. Rocke feller, who claimed to be a devout Baptist, began his at - tempt to infl u ence American education in the late 1800s, with a $600,000 donation to the American Baptist Education Society for an endowment for the University of Chicago. Between 1890 and 1914, Rocke feller, through the society, handed out close to a million dollars to many diff er - ent schools. But the lynchpin of his attempt to guide American education w as his formation of the National Education Board and the continuing Rocke feller support to the University of Chicago. Th e ma mmoth university now encompasses an undergraduate college, four graduate divisions, six professional schools as well as libraries, labora- tories, museums, clinics, and other institutions; nursery and K-12 schools; a c ontinuing-studies program; and an academic press. In 2003, a univer - sity center opened in Paris to accommodate the school’s program of Euro - pe an studies.

A former senator from Connecticut, Benton graduated from Yale U niversity in 1921, then worked in advertising until becoming a part-time vice president of the University of Chicago in 1932. During World War II, he served as assistant secretary of state in Washington, D.C., until 1947, during which time he was active in organiz ing the United Nations. He served as a member of and delegate to numerous United Nations and international conferences and commissions. A declared Democrat, he was U.S. senator from 1949 until 1953. From 1943 until his death in 1973, Benton was chairman of the board and publisher of Encyclopaedia Britannica . It was announced in 1996 that 100 percent of the company’s stock was p urchased for an undisclosed amount by an investment group led by Jacob Safra, who headed the Swiss bank of his name, which in 1955 opened a branch in Brazil. Bank Jacob Safra Switzerland is part of the Safra Group, a far- fl ung chain of financial institutions. Some conspiracy researchers see the private ownership of the world’s premier encyclopedia as the perfect means for controlling public knowledge, particularly in the areas of his- tory and science. “Th e cr eation and funding of the University of Chicago had done much to enhance Rocke feller’s public relations profile among Baptists and educators . . . . Th e o nly diffi culty was that education, on the whole, wasn’t in bad shape,” explained Paolo Lionni, author of Th e Leipzig Connection, his 1993 book that traced the deleterious effects of experimental psychol - ogy on the education system back to German professor of philosophy W ilhelm Max Wundt, the founder of experimental psychology. “Th e in - digenous American educational system was deeply rooted in the beliefs a nd practices of the Puritan Fathers, the Quakers, the early American pa - triots and phi los o phers. Jeff e rson had maintained that in order to preserve liberty in the new nation, it was essential that its citizenry be educated, what ever their income.

By the start of the twentieth century, the United States was home to many major universities, which turned out thousands of well-trained teachers each year. Lionni noted: “Educational results far exceeded those of modern sch ools. One has only to read old debates in the Congressional Record or scan the books published in the 1800s to realize that our ancestors of a century ago commanded a use of the language far superior to our own. Students learned how to read not comic books but the essays of Burke, Webster, Lincoln, Horace, Cicero. Th eir diffi culties with grammar were overcome long before they graduated from school, and any review of a typical elementary school arithmetic textbook printed before 1910 shows dramatically that students were learning mathematical skills that few of our current high school graduates know anything about. Th e high school graduate of 1900 was an educated person, fl uent in his language, history, and culture, possessing the skills he needed in order to succeed.” Th e a genda behind Rocke feller’s creation of the GEB may have been revealed in correspondence from Frederick T. Gates, Rockefeller’s choice to head the board. Gates wrote, “In our dreams, we have limitless resources and the people y ield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hands. Th e present education conventions fade from their minds, and unhampered by tradi - tion, we work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive rural fo lk. We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philos ophers or men of learning, or men of science.

So we will organize our children and teach them to do in a perfect way the things their fathers and mothers are doing in an imper - fect way, in the homes, in the shops and on the farm.” Paolo Lionni wrote: “It would be false to say [ John D.

In 1935, Ernst Mueller, head of the German-American Settlement L eague, acquired lakeside property in Yaphank, Long Island, and invited Americans of German descent to visit and relax. He also formed a group called the German-American Youth. Th e youth in Yaphank constructed tents on platforms, called Camp Siegfried. Gustave Neuss, the grandson of German immigrants, whose father served as a judge in Yaphank, re - called: “Some of the parents complained about the harsh conditions and a t least one removed her daughter from the camp because of this. Th e regimen included education in pro-Nazi doctrine to ensure a new genera - tion having the pure Aryan philosophy.” Neuss’s father initially was f riendly with the German organi zation but soon turned against them be - cause of their anti-Semitism and un-American speeches. Th e y outh organization was part of the German-American Bund, an anti-Semitic fraternal group formed in the 1930s by a merger of the Na - tional Socialist German Workers Party and the Free Society of Teutonia. G erman-American Bund activity was not limited to Yaphank and the New York City area. Neuss wrote: “Groups of the pro-Nazis were located throughout the United States. Hitler’s claim was that aft er he had con - quered Europe he would then take over the USA. Th e Bu nd and other pro-German groups located throughout the country provided a cadre of subversives to assist in such a takeover.” Although many German-American organizations existed in the pre - war United States, the Bund was among the only ones to express support fo r Nazi ideals.

T HE N AT IONA L T EACH ER S Association, now known as the National Education Association, was founded in 1850 as a professional teacher or - ganization, but today has become the largest labor union in the United S tates, representing almost 3 million educators. In 1966, the NEA merged with the American Teachers Association, an organization primarily con - cerned with education in the black community, yet another special inter - est of the Rocke fellers, who funneled money into black education programs a nd organizations. By 1964, Rocke feller’s General Education Board had spent more than $3.2 million in gift s to support black education, criti - cized by some as merely a means to instill white values and worldviews in b lack students. According to William H. Watkins, author of Th e W hite Architects of Black Education: Ideology and Power in America, 1865 – 195 4 , John D. Rocke feller Sr. was more concerned with shaping a new industrial social order than providing a useful education. “Th e Rocke feller group demon - strated how gift - giving could shape education and public policy,” com - mented Watkins. Conservative Republican Pat Buchanan decried the eff or ts of the NEA as a negative infl uence on American education. In a 1999 interview, he stated that “ever since the judges have gotten heavily into education, and the National Education Association has gotten into control of the De- partment of Education, test scores go down, there’s violence in classroom, t hings are going wrong.” Criticism also has been leveled at the NEA Ex-Gay Educators Caucus, whose literature states the purpose of the caucus is to “work within the NEA to make policy changes to ensure that the Ex-Gay voice is heard.” Opposing the Ex-Gay Educators Caucus at the 2004 NEA National Convention was Kevin Jennings, a former"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"304 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH private- school teacher in Massachusetts and founder of the Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network, who has partnered with the NEA in pro - moting ac ceptance of homosexuality using curriculum materials in the na tion’s schools, beginning as early as kindergarten and the elementary grades. At the convention, Jennings was presented the NEA’s human rights “creative leadership” award. Education today is mixing drugs with student control. In years past, if a ch ild was acting up or caught staring out the window, he or she received a rap on the knuckles with a ruler and was told to stay with the rest of the class. Today, the child is sent to the school nurse, who oft entimes tells the parents the student has attention-defi cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD ) and recommends the administration of Prozac (94% sodium fl uoride) or Ritalin, psychotropic drugs that have been shown to produce psychosis in lab rats. At least one state has put a stop to this practice. In 2001, the Connecticut House voted 141–0 on a law prohibiting school personnel from recommending to parents that their children take Ritalin or other mood- altering drugs. Republican State Representative Lenny Winkler, one of the bill’s primary sponsors, quoted studies showing the number of children taking Ritalin nationally jumped from 500,000 in 1987 to more than 6 million by 2001. Th e bill also prohibited the state’s Department of Children and Families from taking children away from parents who de - cline to put their children on mood- altering drugs. A 1999 study at the Human Development Center at the University of Wi sconsin in Eau Claire found that thirteen “ADHD” children on medi - cation, over four years, performed progressively worse on standardized test s than a group of thirteen normal children with similar IQs and other characteristics. Another study, by Dr. Gretchen LeFever, an assistant pro - fessor of pediatrics and psychiatry at Eastern Virginia Medical School, r evealed that while children in her community used the drug Ritalin two to three times more than the national rate, their academic perfor mance in relation to their peers showed no improvement. For her persistence in questioning the rising incidence of drug use in schoolchildren, Dr. LeFe - ver was fired in 2005. Psychiatrist Peter Breggin, in his 1991 book T oxic Psychiatry, wrote: “Hyperactivity is the most frequent justifi cation for drugging children."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"EDUCATION 305 Th e diffi cult-to- control male child is certainly not a new phenomenon, but attempts to give him a medical diagnosis are the product of modern psychology and psychiatry. At first psychiatrists called hyperactivity a brain disease. When no brain disease could be found, they changed it to ‘minimal brain disease’ (MBD). When no minimal brain disease could be found, the profession transformed the concept into ‘minimal brain dys - function.’ When no minimal brain dysfunction could be demonstrated, t he label became ‘attention defi cit disorder.’ Now it’s just assumed to be a real disease, regardless of the failure to prove it so. ‘Biochemical imbal - ance’ is the code word, but there’s no more evidence for that than there is fo r actual brain disease.” Alan Larson, a former secretary of the Oregon Federation of Indepen - dent Schools, criticized the expanding diagnosis of attention defi ci t disor - der (ADD) and was an outspoken critic of the indiscriminate use of drugs, p roclaiming, “[T]he labeling of children with ADD is not because of a problem the kids have; it is because of a problem teachers who cannot tol - erate active children have.” According to John Cornwell, author of Hitl er’s Scientists, the center of psychoanalysis shift ed from Germany to the United States aft er the war. “[M]any of the homegrown analysts were German trained,” he noted. Th is charge was echoed by Dr. Thomas Roeder, Volker Kubillus, and An - thony Burwell in their book Ps ychiatrists — the Men Behind Hitler . “In the period since 1971,” they wrote, “child and adolescent psychiatry devel - oped completely along the theoretical and methodological lines developed b y its Nazi- era founders.” Th e infl ux of Nazi-trained psychiatrists aft er World War II, particu - larly in the military and intelligence fi el ds, has produced a blossoming of psychological disorders. Th e American Psychiatric Association, in its 1952 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM), defined only 112 mental disorders. By the publication of DSM-IV in 1994, the number had grown to 374. “Today, though psychiatry may still be suspect among the public, it has w on over both government and the media.

In the 1970s, when the drug companies tried to find substitutes for L SD because of its serious side eff ects, they developed the antidepressant Prozac (fl uoxetine) followed by Zoloft (s er t ra l i ne), E ff exor (venlafaxine), and Paxil (paroxetine). Dr. Helmut Remschmidt, who directed the Soci - ety for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry until 1984, was a leader in re - search into hyperactivity in children. He studied under Dr. Hermann S tutte, who was associated with Nazi psychiatrists involved in the Ger - man euthanasia program and had received his doctorate from Robert S ommer, director of the Deutscher Verband fur psychische Hygiene, or the German Association for Mental Hygiene. Dr. Remschmidt, long aft er the war, still pointed to “a genetic answer” to hyperactivity and was a lead - ing proponent of the use of drugs such as Ritalin. “It is by no means shocking for Remschmidt to be a prominent advo - cate of horrible things,” commented Roeder, Kubillus, and Burwell. “Af - ter all, he is a disciple and protégé of Nazis . . . . What is equally frightening a nd obvious is that the racist and elitist theories of the original child psychiatrists—as documented in 1940 at the First Congress—have not only survived but fl ourished. It has been a natural passage of poison from teacher to student, from the Nazis to subsequent generations of child and adolescent psychiatrists. Th e eff orts ‘to spot and screen’—that is, to dis - tinguish between the valuable and less valuable human beings—are more th an dubious—they are indefensible.” Yet, the number of child psycholo - gists in U.S. schools grew from a mere 500 in 1940 to more than 22,000 by 1990. According to Kelly Patricia O’Meara, a former chief of staff in the U.S. H ouse of Representatives, whose investigative reports on child vaccines and mood- altering drugs prompted congressional hearings, “Th irty years ago, the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded that Ritalin was pharmacologically similar to cocaine in the pattern of abuse it fostered, and cited it as a Schedule II drug—the most addictive in medical use.

Drugs such as Ritalin, now used to treat questionable mental affl i c- tions, are taken by tens of millions of American youngsters. A 1986 edi - tion of Th e I nternational Journal of the Addictions listed 105 adverse reactions to Ritalin, including suicidal tendencies. Americans wonder why there has been a rash of school shootings and t een suicides in recent years, yet virtually all of these killings have involved a student on mood- altering drugs or just coming off them. In fi ve cases of school shootings between March 1998 and May 1999—including the tragedy at Columbine High School—at least seven of the students in - volved were being medicated. It was downplayed but reported that S eung-Hui Cho, the gunman in the Virginia Tech shootings in April 2007, had been undergoing psychological counseling and had prescrip - tion psychoactive drugs in his possession. In his book Reclaiming Our Children, ps ychiatrist and drug critic Dr. Peter Breggin analyzed the clinical and scientifi c reasons for asserting that Eric Harris’s violence at Columbine was caused by the prescription drug Luvox. “I’ve also testifi ed to the same under oath in depositions in a case related to Columbine,” Breggin wrote, adding, “I also warned that stop - ping antidepressants can be as dangerous as starting them, since they can ca use very disturbing and painful withdrawal reactions.” A Web site called TeenScreenTruth is dedicated to gathering informa - tion off t he Internet to help teens “connect the dots to see the revealing connections” between mood- altering drugs and teen violence. Th e Web site states: “Here’s a statistic that is rarely mentioned in news reports: in nearly every school-shooting incident, the children and teens involved were already taking one or more psychiatric drugs or had just recently come off them, and had been under the care of a psychiatrist or mental-health prac - titioner.

B U T T H E EDUCAT ION issue that has drawn the greatest recent contro - versy is Public Law 107-110, better known as the No Child Left Behind A ct of 2001 (NCLB), a prized legacy of the Bush administration. Accord - ing to the act, its purpose is “to ensure that all children have a fair, equal, an d signifi cant opportunity to obtain a high- quality education and reach, at a minimum, profi ciency on challenging state academic achievement standards and state academic assessments.” Signed into law by President George W. Bush on January 8, 2002, the act n evertheless brought immediate criticism from educators, state author - ities, and libertarians alike. Th e y questioned the act’s sweeping proposals, which range from forcing teachers to conform to federally mandated cur - ricula to inflicting monetary punishments on school districts that do not live up to federal expectation, and even taking state control or turning them over to private management companies. Th ey also questioned the $410 million apportioned for the education of migratory children, most of whom come from the families of illegal aliens. Standardized testing has proven a handicap to children who speak En glish as a second language. While no caring person would want to be caught leaving some poor ch ild “behind,” there was nevertheless the irksome feeling by many that the act was a thinly disguised attempt to force conformity on students and standardize the minds of American youth. It smacks of the same uni - formity of education sought by the National Socialists under Hitler. Some c onservatives and libertarians even claim that the act is an usurpation of state authority by the federal government. In 2007, the new Congress be - gan taking steps to protect states from the controls and punishments of N CLB. For example, in 2005, when Utah passed a state law allowing school districts to ignore portions of NCLB, the Department of Educa - tion threatened to withhold federal education funds. Th e backbone of NCLB is federally mandated standardized testing, which long has been accused of cultural bias. In fact, the entire practice of testing as a determinant of educational quality has been called into ques -"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"EDUCATION 313 tion, because the emphasis on tests forces teachers to teach only material that will get students to pass the tests, leaving a defi ciency in grasping greater understanding and thinking critically. It should also be realized that both the textbook publishers and the standardized testing firms are, for the most part, controlled by the same globalist corporations under discussion. Th e act r ewards districts with better test scores, so critics claim that schools lower their standards to show improvement on test scores. Th e kids are not learning more, just being assessed diff erently. A 2007 report from the Center on Education Policy (CEP) indicated increased test scores in reading and math, but it was unclear if this refl ected enhanced learning or lower standards on student tests. “Look at any state that has a 90 percent profi ciency level with lots of students in poverty,” commented Jack Jennings, president and CEO of CEP. “Th at doesn’t happen without either an extraordinary eff ort to raise the quality of education for all stu - dents or setting lower standards.” Another portion of the NCLB Act that rankled libertarians was Sec - tion 9528, which requires schools to give military recruiters the name, h ome phone number, and address of every enrolled student. Schools are not required to tell the students or parents that their information has been passed on, but students can ask to not have their contact informa - tion shared. But filing the required form often means student information is w ithheld from universities and job recruiters as well as the military. Unlike the Nazis, who placed great emphasis on athletics and physical fitn ess, the NCLB Act narrowly focuses on two main skills: reading and math. As a result, there are claims that other areas of schooling have been neglected, especially physical education. Th is i dea was reinforced by recent data from the Centers for Disease Control, showing kids between the ages of six and nineteen, some nine million youngsters, suff er from obesity. “With the obesity rates going up and it’s in our face, why are we cutting PE time? I don’t get it,” quest ioned PE teacher Garrett Lydic, Delaware’s 2006 Teacher of the Year. “Th e fo - cus right now is on testing,” he said, referring to a series of academic tests n ow mandated by federal law. “Th e result is that there’s less time to get kids more active.”"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"314 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH “It’s a stretch even to call the law ‘well-intentioned’ given that its crea - tors, including the Bush administration and the right-wing Heritage F oundation [Paul Weyrich, its founder, has been accused of ties to Nazi collaborators] want to privatize public education. Hence NCLB’s merci - less testing, absurd timetables and reliance on threats,” commented US A To d a y education writer Alfi e Kohn. “No wonder 129 education and civil rights organizations have endorsed a letter to Congress deploring the law’s overemphasis on standardized testing and punitive sanctions. No wonder 30,000 people [mid-2007] have signed a petition at educatorroundtable .org calling the law ‘too destructive to salvage.’ ” Like Hitler, the globalist creators of a new empire carry an innate dis - trust of education that might explain why their education programs ap - pear to savage true learning. “I do not wish any intellectual upbringing what soever, knowledge may only demoralize youth,” Adolf Hitler once said. He echoed the statement of John D. Rocke feller, founder of the Na - tional Education Board, who said, “I don’t want a nation of thinkers. I w ant a nation of workers.” Hitler also felt that intellectuals might not only present a rival to Nazi i deology but could form a group separate from the common man through a feeling of superiority due to their knowledge and education. “What we suff er from today is an excess of education,” he stated in 1938. “What we require is instinct and will.” Hitler’s sentiment was echoed recently by President George W. Bush. J ournalist Ron Suskind, writing in the New York Times Magazine, re - ported an incident in Washington: “Forty democratic senators were gath - ered for a lunch in March [2004] just off the Senate fl oo r.

O NE M AJOR DI FFER ENCE between the Th ird Reich and the Fourth is the lack of emphasis on fl ag ceremonies and repetitious pledges. In Nazi Ger - many, a school day did not pass without these ceremonies of the state. But in multicultural and globalized America, although schoolchildren s till recite the Pledge of Allegiance and raise the U.S. fl ag, any formal ceremony has dropped away. Today, hardly any American—child or adult (with the possible exception of some Girl and Boy Scouts)—knows or observes proper fl ag protocols. If the Pledge of Allegiance is used in schools, it is generally spoken over t he loudspeaker. Students can recite along or not, as they will. If they can obtain a note from their parents, they are not even required to stand. Pa - triotic allegiance to one’s nation is not conducive to the globalists’ agenda o f borderless countries under the control of multinational corporations. Today, such nationalistic trappings have been replaced by ubiquitous c orporate logos and slogans. More and more educational programs are be - ing underwritten—and guided—by corporate offi cia ls. President Bush’s secretary of education Margaret Spellings hosted the 2006–07 Siemens Competition in Math, Science, and Technology. In May 2006, she told attendees of the first National Summit on the Advancement of Girls in Math and Science in Washington, D.C., “I recently met with George No- len, president and CEO of Siemens Corporation, and I look forward to working with him on President Bush’s American Competitiveness Initia - tive.” Business leaders began to realize that education had failed to keep up w ith the corporatism of America. Prudential CEO Art Ryan complained that hiring high school graduates today is a high risk. “Th ey can’t do many of the things you would like them to do. But have high schools changed to refl ect that economy? I would argue not enough.” Another rising concern in education that can be traced back to corpo- rate intrusion is the rise of advertising in schools. According to a debate"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"316 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH posted on the offi cial NEA Web site, teachers have complained that get - ting kids to buy products, feel good about a corporation, or adopt the v iewpoints of an industry on an important issue is not the purpose of edu - cation and that promotional sponsored education materials blur the line bet ween education and propaganda and lead to distorted lessons. Manny Lopez, a fourth- grade teacher at the International Community Sch ool in Oakland, California, warned, “Upon entering our schools, ad - vertisers would dictate the placement of their billboards, banners, and l ightboxes. Th e highly visible areas normally reserved for students’ art - work, bulletin boards, and school/community message centers would be ta ken over. It would only be a matter of time before advertisers would at - tempt to have a hand in the curriculum, molding a school into a corporate i mage.” Retired Georgia teacher Elizabeth Gould wrote, “[Advertising] gives students a warped sense of the world. Th ey think everything is up for sale—ethics, morals, children.” Arguing in favor of school advertising, Kathleen McMahon, a fo urth- grade teacher at Alice Costello School in Brooklawn, New Jersey, said, “In an ideal world, schools would have all the money they need to fund programs and buy equipment, but we’re not living in Utopia. Public and private colleges accept money from plutocrats every day.” Gary Ruskin, writing in Adve rtising Age magazine, urged advertisers to exercise self-restraint or face future legal restrictions. He noted, “Advertis - ers are being expelled from schools in droves. Channel One, the in-school a dvertising service, was removed last school year from Nashville, and will soon be kicked out of Seattle. New restrictions on the marketing or sale of soda or junk food in school have been approved in places such as Califor - nia, Texas, New York City and Philadelphia.” C OR P OR AT E I N VOLV E M E N T W I T H education is not a new idea. In the late 1800s, a group of Chicago businessmen became concerned that edu - cation in Germany and Austria was moving ahead of American educa - tion. “Unlike American schools, German classrooms divided kids into t wo tracks: one for those destined to become managers and the other for"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"EDUCATION 317 those destined to be their employees,” explained Elizabeth Weiss Green writing in U.S. News & World Report . But even in the 1800s, thoughtful persons questioned the propriety of b usiness guiding education. “Education would then become an instru - ment of perpetuating unchanged the existing industrial order of society. W ho, then, shall conduct education so that humanity may improve?” questioned John Dewey, the American philos opher, psychologist, and ed - ucation reformer. In mid-2007, billionaires Bill Gates and Eli Broad announced they had poo led $60 million to finance a campaign to emphasize education in the 2008 elections. However, the pair’s ideas for improving American educa - tion were immediately criticized, because the three tenets of their cam - paign were: making teachers’ salary increases dependent on student test sc ores, keeping students in class with more days and longer hours, and set - ting federal curriculum standards based on input from corporate leaders. N AT IONA L S OCI A L I SM I N the Germany of the 1930s made a strong ap - peal to its youth. Th e N azis fully realized that if the younger generations could be brought to their worldview, the future of National Socialism would be assured. “Fascism in all countries made a fetish of youthful - ness,” commented George L. Mosse, author of N azi Culture . “What a contrast this off ered to the elderly politicians haggling in parliaments, or to the fossilized bureaucracies which ran the nations (and the politi - cal parties) of Europe.” Modern America also has witnessed conflict between the younger and old er generations. Th e genesis of this generational conflict began with the rock- and-roll music of the 1950s and grew full-blown with the Vietnam War, when families were split along lines of age. Th e young embraced the antiwar movement while the older generations, tempered by the propa - ganda of World War II, supported the war policies of Lyndon Johnson a nd Richard Nixon. Here again was a refl ecti on of Nazi Germany, where Hitler’s promises of a more prosperous future held considerable sway with the younger"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"318 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH generations. “Th e young were set off against the old,” observed Mosse, “and the distinction that was made between the old and young nations was operative within the Vol k itself. When Hitler damned the bourgeoi - sie, he was inveighing against the older generation, brought up under the [ First and Second] Empire.” Th is ge nerational conflict, caused by control over popular culture such as music, films, art, etc., was merely another use of the divide- and-conquer tactic. American journalist and educator Milton Mayer was both Jewish and o f German ancestry. He traveled in Europe before the war and tried un - successfully to gain an audience with Hitler in 1935. Seven years aft er the war ended, Mayer traveled in Germany, searching to understand what had made the average German blindly follow National Socialism. “I never found the average German,” he recounted in a 1955 book, “be - cause there is no average German. But I found ten Germans suffi c iently diff erent from one another in background, character, intellect, and tem - perament to represent, among them, some millions or tens of millions of G ermans and sufficiently like unto one another to have been Nazis. “I found—and find—it hard to judge my Nazi friends,” he wrote. “I l iked them. I couldn’t help it . . . . I was overcome by the same sensation t hat had got in the way of my newspaper reporting in Chicago years be - fore. I liked A l Capone. I liked the way he treated his mother. He treated her better than I treated mine.” Mayer recounted the story of one unnamed German academic, a lan - guage teacher, and his experience as Hitler’s Th i rd Reich grew in promi - nence. In light of modern America, it is worth repeating. Th i s teacher said that aft er 1933 no one seemed to notice the ever-widening gap between the government and the people. “Th is separa - tion of government from people, this widening of the gap, took place so g radually and so insensibly, each step disguised (perhaps not even inten - tionally) as a temporary emergency measure or associated with true patri - otic allegiance or with real social purposes. And all the crises and reforms ( real reforms, too) so occupied the people that they did not see the slow motion underneath, of the whole pro cess of government growing remoter and remoter.”"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"EDUCATION 319 As a scholar, this man was consumed with “meetings, conferences, in - terviews, ceremonies, and, above all, papers to be filled out, reports, bibli - ographies, lists, questionnaires . . . .

One had no time. The dictatorship, and the whole pro cess of its coming into being, was above all diverting. It provided an excuse not to think for people who did not want to think anyway. Unconsciously, I sup - pose, we were grateful. Who wants to think?” He said to live in this pro cess required not noticing it. “Each step was so s mall, so inconsequential, so well explained or, on occasion, ‘regretted,’ that, unless one were detached from the whole pro cess from the begin - ning, unless one understood what the whole thing was in principle, what a ll these ‘little measures’ that no ‘patriotic German’ could resent must some day lead to, one no more saw it developing from day to day than a farmer in his fi eld sees the corn growing. One day it is over his head.” Pastor Martin Niemoeller spoke for men like this academic when he sa id: “First they came for the Communists, but I was not a Communist so I did not speak out. Th en they came for the Socialists and the Trade Unionists, but I was neither, so I did not speak out. Th en they came for the Jews, but I was not a Jew so I did not speak out. And when they came for me, there was no one left to speak out for me.” A great part of this hesitancy to resist encroaching fascism was not due to fear, according to the academic Milton Mayer, but to genuine uncertainty that anyone else was seeing the things as he did. In Nazi Germany, people who questioned the motives behind government policies were deemed alarmists. In Amer - ica today, they are called conspiracy theorists. “[I]n small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talk - ing to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things.

Th e fo rms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identi - fying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fea r, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Suddenly it all comes down, all at once.

And the people in Germany wh o, once the war had begun, still thought of complaining, protesting, resisting, were betting on Germany’s losing the war. It was a long bet. Not many made it.” Of particular concern to Americans who look beyond the advancing fa scist agenda is the question of who will come to their rescue? Nazi-occupied Europe, and even many Germans toward the end of the war, looked hopefully to the Allied nations for their liberation.

All labor matters were combined into the Deutsche Arbeitsfront, or German Labor Front, a monolithic Nazi organization created by Hitler to replace the old labor union system. Again, the agenda of the corporate globalists was at work to curtail any me aningful power within the working class. However, despite early labor support based on pro-labor Nazi slogans and propaganda, the workers soon realized that the promised labor-professional equality was a myth, and labor problems continued to plague the Nazi government right through the end of the war. In light of the continuing problems in Nazi Germany, the globalists d eclined to create a labor-controlling mechanism with modern America. Instead, they began a successful program of buying corrupt labor leaders, making deals with the crime syndicates that controlled certain unions, and crippling labor through federal legislation pushed through Congress with corporate money. Th e Reagan and both Bush administrations were particularly antiunion."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"322 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH One example of this occurred in the 1980s, when the Reagan admin - istration crushed collective bargaining by air traffi c c ontrollers, who de - sired increased air safety through better working conditions rather than j ust higher wages. Another example came in mid-2002, when a labor dispute between the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) and the Pacifi c Maritime Association (PMA) caused a stack-up of cargo ships along the West Coast from San Diego to Seattle, which threatened to cut deeply into the 2002–03 holiday season profi ts. Th e strike was broken in October, when President Bush invoked the Ta ft -Hartley Act, a controversial 1947 union-busting law that was passed over President Truman’s veto. Under this law, an eighty- day “cooling off ” period can be ordered during a “national emergency.” Although Bush’s action received scant attention in a media focused on t he impending invasion of Iraq, one official of ILWU, Jack Heyman, termed Bush’s intervention “a historic juncture in the labor movement.” Heyman added, “By invoking Taft -Hartley against the longshore workers, Bush is eff ectively declaring war on the working class here and the Iraqi people simultaneously.” It has already been demonstrated how many U.S. government and cor - porate policies have been instituted by firms and organizations created a nd controlled by America’s wealthy elite globalists. Th e g lobalists also created the myth that the Rockefellers represent the apex of America’s wealthy elite, a description the Rockefellers have done little to discourage. Th e long-standing idea that American oil magnate John D. Rockefeller was driven solely by greed obscured the fact that he was financed by outside sources. According to Eustace Mullins, the Rockefeller combine has never been an independent power. It was this Rockefeller myth of a homegrown elite that distracted attention from the international globalists and allowed the American public to accept the family as the nation’s preemi - nent power. “[T]he Rockefeller oil trust [became] the ‘military-industrial c omplex,’ which assumed political control of the nation; the Rockefeller medical monopoly attained control of the health care of the nation; and the Rockefeller Foundation, a web of affi liated tax-exempt creations, eff ectively controlled the religious and educational life of the nation,” wrote Mullins. “Th e Rock e feller Syndicate operates under the control of the world fi -"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"PSYCHOLOGY AND PUBLIC CONTROL 323 nancial structure, which means that on any given day, all of its assets could be rendered close to worthless by adroit financial manipulation,” noted Mullins, who observed that patriarch John D. Rocke feller was able to gain almost total control over U.S. oil with financing from the National City Bank of Cleveland, named in congressional reports as a branch of the Rothschild banking empire. According to Mullins, “Th is is the final control, which ensures that no one can quit the organization. Not only would he be stripped of all assets, but he would be under con - tract for immediate assassination. Our Department of Justice is well aware t hat the only ‘terrorists’ operating in the United States are the agents of the World Order, but they prudently avoid any mention of this fact.” In pointing to the awareness of the Justice Department, Mullins, like a uthors John Loft us, Gary Allen, Mark Aarons, and others, was fully aware of the lack of detection or prosecution of Nazi war criminals who came to America, or of any serious prosecution of prominent corporate miscreants. Examples of the machinations of foreign financial powers in the United States, including the secret societies behind the War Between the States, may be found in my book Rule by Secrecy . While it is true that the families that originated the wealthy elite in A merica—the Rocke fellers, the Morgans, the Schiff s, and the Warburgs— have in recent years lost much of their previous infl uence, their giant glo - bal enterprises today remain as powerful as ever, maintaining all the f unctions for which they were first organized. Th is mechanism today has been brought under the control of the fascist globalists, who created both communism and National Socialism using the wealth brought from Eu - rope by the Nazi ratlines. “Since he set up the Trilateral Commission, David Rocke feller has f unctioned as a sort of international courier for the World Order, princi - pally concerned with delivering working instructions to the Communist b loc [now the Rus sian Federation], either directly, in New York, or by traveling to the area,” Mullins argued.

Th e offi cial, controlled government news bombarded the public with assurances that there was light at the end of the tunnel. New secret weapons were coming on line, they were told, and this, as has been noted, was not a total lie. According to their media, God was on their side and all would end well. Th e re also was the knowledge, only heard in whispered rumors, that anyone who spoke out about the true state of Nazi Germany would disap - pear into the offices of the Gestapo, likely never to be seen again. Th e g lobalists have learned from the Nazis of the Th ird Reich how to employ these methods to ensure obedience from an intimidated public. From the constantly changing terrorist alerts and color codes in public places, since September 11, 2001, Americans have learned to live with fear. Unspoken fear is rampant in many levels of contemporary American society, and it is not all caused by unknown foreign terrorists. Fear of gov - ernment harassment and surveillance is widespread.

Just as in the days of the Th ird Reich, if any individual threatens to become too popular or brings too much attention to the fascist activities, they seem to disappear from the scene quickly. One such person was Republican Texas senator John Tower, whose Tower Commission was highly critical of the Reagan-Bush handling of the Iran-contra scandal, and Tower had confi ded to friends that he planned to write a tell- all book.

Lest anyone think this is naive or even paranoid nonsense, consider t hat in late October 2002, Applied Digital Solutions, Incorporation, a high-tech development company headquartered in Palm Beach, Florida, announced the launching of a national promotion for its new subdermal personal verifi cation microchip. Th e “Get Chipped” promotion was de - scribing a device that can be implanted under a person’s skin to transmit d ata to various locations. Th e “VeriChip,” according to company litera - ture, is “an implantable, 12mm by 2.1mm radio frequency device . . . about t he size of the point of a typical ballpoint pen. It contains a unique verifi - cation number. Utilizing an external scanner, radio frequency energy pa sses through the skin, energizing the dormant VeriChip, which then emits a radio frequency signal containing the verification number. Th e number is displayed by the scanner and transmitted to a secure data stor - age site by authorized personnel via telephone or Internet.” In addition to “VeriChip Centers” in Arizona, Texas, and Florida, the fi r m a l s o fi elds the “ChipMobile,” a motorized marketing and “chipping” vehicle. Th e new “Get Chipped” campaign was launched just days aft er the Food and Drug Administration ruled that the chip is not a regulated medical device and stated it found “reasonable assurance” that the chip was safe.

Some stated they would not allow their family members to receive such im - plants. Th e h ead of the federal Department of Health and Human Ser - vices when the VeriChip was approved was Tommy Th o mpson, who aft er leaving his government post joined VeriChip Corporation as a director. He resigned from the company in early 2007 to run an unsuccessful cam - paign as a Republican presidential candidate. Th e la w firm in which Th ompson was partner—Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld LLP—was paid $1.2 million to represent VeriChip, according to the SEC. Uses for the chip include controlling access to nonpublic facilities such a s government buildings and installations, nuclear power plants, national research laboratories, correctional institutions, and transportation hubs— either using the chip by itself or in conjunction with existing security technologies such as ret ina scanners, thumbprint scanners, or face- recog - nition devices.

As technology continues to advance, so does the means of manipulat - ing, even controlling, whole groups of individuals. Th e m eans to control the human mind has come a long way since the days of Nazi concentration camps and the subsequent CIA drug experimentation. Today, beamed electromagnetic frequencies can alter perceptions, instill emotions, and even cloud normal reasoning. All organic life consists of living cells controlled by the DNA within t hem. Th e chemical action within the cells is driven by electromagnetic frequencies that pulse, oscillate, and vibrate. Collectively, the energy within a living organism creates a surrounding, albeit weak, electromag - netic fi el d.

A Special"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"330 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Research Committee of the University of Southern California confirmed that Rife frequencies were reversing many ailments, including cancer. Op - position immediately came from Dr. Th o mas Rivers of the Rocke feller Institute, who had not even seen Rife’s equipment in operation. By 1934, Rife had isolated a virus that bred cancer and stopped it by bombarding it with electromagnetic frequencies. He was successful in killing both carci - noma and sarcoma cancers in more than four hundred tests on animals. It ha s been widely reported that in the summer of 1934, Rife, along with doctors Milbank Johnson and Alvin G. Foord, succeeded in using his frequencies to cure sixteen cancer patients diagnosed as terminal by con - ventional medicine. Rife described the operation of his frequency machine thus: “With the f requency instrument treatment, no tissue is destroyed, no pain is felt, no noise is audible, and no sensation is noticed. A tube lights up and three minutes later the treatment is completed. Th e virus or bacteria is destroyed and the body then recovers itself naturally from the toxic eff ect of the virus or bacteria. Several diseases may be treated simultaneously.” A general anal - ogy to this eff ect is g lass shattering when a singer’s high note is sounded. It did not take long for the medical establishment to realize that such a de vice not only would wreck the pharmaceutical industry but damage medicine in general, since cures meant fewer visits to the doctor. Over - worked and underfunded, Rife and his associates were easy targets for at - tack. False claims were made against him, test procedures were altered, ca using his demonstrations to fail, and impossible and diverting demands were made on Rife’s research. Barry Lyne, who chronicled Rife’s story in his book Th e Cancer Cure Th at Worked, elaborated: “[Rife] was curing cancer while the [International Cancer Research Foundation] broke their agreements, insisted on procedures with inexperienced people, which were doomed from the outset, and ignored the larger goal which Rife was achieving—the cure of cancer in human beings.” Aft e r he declined an off er to partner with Morris Fishbein, then head of the American Medical Association, Rife’s troubles turned more seri - ous, with lawsuits and health authorities coming at him from all sides.

Rife died a broken man in 1971. But while electromagnetic energy manipulation was seeking to make h umans healthier, such technology also brought horrific possibilities for mind control. “Th e early attempts used chemicals and hallucinogenics to achieve some measure of control,” wrote Begich, the son of Alaskan Democrat senator Nick Begich Sr., who disappeared along with congress - man and member of the Warren Commission Hale Boggs when their p lane was lost over Alaska in 1972. “Th en in the early 1960s the interest changed to nonchemical means for aff ecting behavior. By the early 1970s, within certain military and academic circles, it became clear that human behavior could be modifi ed by the use of subtle energetic manipulations. By 2006, the state of the technology had been perfected to the point where emotions, thoughts, memory, and thinking could be manipulated by external means.” According to reports from the military in both the United States and R us sia, psychotronic generators are being developed, which can create an infrasonic oscillation in the 10–20 Hertz range. It is destructive to living organisms; can cause behavior modification by transmitting frequencies through normal telephone, TV, and radio networks; and can produce frequencies to paralyze the central nervous system. “In recent years, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA) has pursued research into brain decoding and the development of electronic micro and nanocircuits that will directly interact with the brain,” stated Dr. Begich. “New microchip technology could be used for direct interaction between the brains of people and computers.” Several methods have been found to allow persons to hear sounds and s peech without the use of the ears or normal auditory pathways—such as the Neurophone. Th is device uses a vibrational technology developed by Patrick Flanagan in 1958, which allows the transmission of sound vibra - tions through the skin, much like the vibration of a speaker. Bypassing the ea r, a completely diff erent part of the brain pro cesses the sound, creating new neural pathways. Such technology is used to increase concentration while studying or learning languages, and it helps with meditation, relaxa - tion, and healing."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"332 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Unfortunately, it was also found that amplifi ed brainwave frequencies can be imposed on others. One U.S. patent even described how very low or very high audio frequencies can be used to transmit subliminal mes - sages to the human brain. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,170,993, ac - cepted in 1965, is called the “Means for Aiding Hearing by Electrical S timulation of the Facial Nerve System.” According to Dr. Begich, all Americans are already under constant bo mbardment from microwave frequencies “one thousand times higher than the level considered safe in the former Soviet Union [a leader in mind- aff ecting energy technology]. Th e reason that the Soviets set their safety standards as low as they did was because they detected biological eff ects at levels ignored by the West,” he explained. But while microwaves may be aff ecti ng large segments of the popula - tion in the United States, this issue pales when one considers the possibil - ity of a program to consciously target whole populations. Such a program ex ists in the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP), a vast array of powerful transmitting dishes located near Gakona, Alaska. Offi cially, HAARP is designed to study the uppermost portion of the Earth’s atmosphere: the ionosphere. However, critics of the program, in - cluding Dr. Begich and other scientists, claim this powerful array can be used a s a weapon, to deliver energy blasts equal to an atomic bomb, de - stroy communications across the planet, and even infl u ence human be - havior. Critics argue that HAARP has the capability of stimulating the iono - sphere to return a pulsed electromagnetic signal, which, at the proper fre - quency, can override normal brain functions. In 2002, the Rus sians, who experimented with both psychic and m ind- altering technologies as far back as the 1970s, expressed their con - cern with HAARP. A complaint letter from the Rus sian State Duma to P resident Vladimir Putin stated that HAARP was infl uencing near- Earth atmosphere with high-frequency radio waves. “Th e signifi cance of this qualitative leap [in science] could be compared to the transition from cold steel to firearms, or from conventional weapons to nuclear weapons.

Despite this objection, no discernible action has been taken by the United States, and the HAARP system continues to operate. Dr. Begich warned that allowing the military-industrial complex to so lely guide such mind-control research not only runs the risk of creating an Orwellian thought-controlled society but would prevent the “enabling enhancement of human potentials in ways only reserved in the past to mystics, religious fi gures, and those who sought to change people.” I NCR E DI BLY, COM PU T E R S YS T E MS are under development today to an - ticipate criminal or antisocial behavior.

In Vienna, during September 1940, at the First Conference of the Ger - man Society for Child Psychiatry and Th erap eutic Education—later changed to the German Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry—Dr. Anna Leiter, a genetic researcher from Dresden, who studied three thou - sand youngsters for possible antisocial traits, stated, “We demand that as soo n as a careful and responsible analysis shows an extremely unusual lack of emotions in connection with other criminogenic reactive tendencies, we detain these children as early as possible, since they represent an un - bearable burden and danger for the entire country.” Nazi educators pointed to these symptoms of “bad student material” t hat would qualify for such detention: actual and potential repeaters of lower public school grades, students recommended for sp ecial school, “borderline and questionable cases,” uneducable children, those with spe - cial educational diffi c ulties, and schoolchildren whose siblings and fami - lies are or have been in special schools. It was stated that “genetic and na tional health considerations recommend their preventative registra - tion.” Of course, such registration led to the euthanasia centers.

Amazingly, this power to detain suspects even before they actually c ommitted a crime was based on mental health laws. “Th e F ixated Th reat Assessment Centre (FTAC) was quietly estab - lished last October [2006] and is set to reignite controversy over the de - tention of suspects without trial,” wrote Th e Times reporter Joanna Bale. “Until now it has been up to mental health professionals to determine if someone should be forcibly detained, but the new unit uses the police to identify suspects, increasing fears that distinctions are being blurred be - tween criminal investigations and doctors’ clinical decisions.” Th e FTAC unit will be staff ed by four police offi cers, two civilian re - searchers, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, and a community mental health n urse. It was hailed as the first joint mental health–police unit in the United Kingdom and a “prototype for future joint services” in other ar - eas. Even as this police unit was assuming the power to arrest and hold po tential “suspects,” Scotland Yard refused to discuss how many suspects have been forcibly hospitalized by the team, because of “patient confiden - tiality.” Meanwhile, the British government was introducing legislation to b roaden the definition of mental disorders to give doctors—and now police—more power to detain people. “Th e re is a grave danger of this being used to deal with people where there is insuffi cient evidence for a criminal prosecution,” said Gareth Crossman, policy director for Britain’s National Council for Civil Liber - ties. “Th is b lurs the line between medical decisions and police actions.

Many conspiracy researchers suspect that the glo - balists try out new policies and methods in the United Kingdom first, to see i f they are accepted by the public. Once off e nders are picked up, today they face new types of unconstitu - tional trials. Some researchers saw Bush’s Military Commissions Act with i ts secret tribunals as an echo of the Th ird Reich “special courts,” which were designed to prosecute political resistance to the Nazi administration. “Th e main duty of the special courts was to criminally prosecute the po - litical resistance to the Nazi regime,” wrote Dr. Th om as Roeder, Volker Kubillus, and Anthony Burwell in their book Psychiatrists — the Men Be - hind Hitler . “Du ring the Second World War, they gradually took over the duties of ordinary justice and from 1942 on, most of the sentencing. Ex - perts estimate that the special court of Hannover alone, one of several in t oday’s Saxony, sentenced 4,000 defendants, about 170 of them to death.” Another eerie parallel between the Bush administration and the Th ir d Reich involved the Fuehrerprinzip, or leader principle, which was out - lined in Hitler’s book Mein Kampf . Th is p rinciple stated the leader em - bodied National Socialism and therefore the people. All decision-making r ested with him. Such thinking evolves from the lack of trust in the peo - ple. National Socialism, like our democracy, was supposedly a movement o f the masses. But its leadership had little faith in its followers. “[Nazi] ideology denounced civilian methods of elections, negotiation, a nd compromise as horse trading and called for authority of command, discipline and obedience,” noted Professor Louis L. Snyder in his Encyclo - pedia of the Th ir d Reich . Th is top-down leadership principle sounds eerily similar to calls by President George W. Bush for a “unifi ed presidency” as well as his comment to reporters in April 2006, “I hear the voices, and I read the front page, and I know the speculation. But I’m the decider, and I decide what is best.” “Perhaps the most unique feature of the Bush admin - istration is its protracted period of unifi ed pa rty control of the govern - ment, a stark contrast to the divided governments of George H. W. Bush a nd Ronald Reagan,” noted Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution.

Yet, Bush has argued that actions allowing him to ride roughshod over t he Congress, the courts, and the Constitution were somehow necessary to preserve the presidency. “I have an obligation to make sure that the presidency remains robust and that the legislative branch doesn’t end up running the executive branch,” Bush argued in mid-2002. In launching the invasion of Iraq in 2003, Bush preempted the power of Congress, as the U.S. Constitution under Section 8 clearly states that only Congress has the power to declare war. When he and his appointees rammed the USA PATRIOT Act through a cowed Congress, with little or no input, he likewise took powers from the representatives of the people. A panicky House of Representatives, still in shock over 9/11 and the su bsequent anthrax attacks, rushed the PATRIOT Act into law by a vote of 339–79. The act was 342 pages long and made changes, both great and small, to more than fift een diff erent U.S. laws, many of them enacted fol - lowing revelations about the misuse of surveillance powers by the FBI and C IA. It was hurriedly and enthusiastically signed into law by President Bush on October 26, 2001. Th e speed with which this legislation was pre - sented to Congress left little doubt in many minds that it had long been p repared and simply needed some provocation as an impetus for action. According to some congressmen, many lawmakers had not even read t he entire document when it was passed. Th e ACLU also reported that some members of Congress had less than one hour to read the extensive changes of law contained within the act. Congressman Dennis Kucinich, a Democrat from Ohio, described the atmosphere in which the PATRIOT Act was passed: “There was great fear in our great Capitol . . . . Th e great fear began when we had to evacuate the Capitol on September 11. It con - tinued when we had to leave the Capitol again when a bomb scare oc - curred as members were pressing the CIA during a secret briefing.

I thought it w as undermining the Constitution, so I didn’t vote for it—therefore I’m somehow not a patriot. Th at’s insulting.” Paul confirmed rumors that the bill was not read by most members of t he House prior to their vote. “It’s my understanding the bill wasn’t printed before the vote—at least I couldn’t get it,” he told Insight maga - zine. “Th e y played all kinds of games, kept the House in session all night, and it was a very complicated bill. Maybe a handful of staff ers actually read it, but the bill definitely was not available to members before the vote.” Paul’s view of the PATRIOT Bill was echoed by the only indepen - dent in the House, Congressman Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who said, “I t ook an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, and I’m concerned that voting for this legislation fundamentally violates that oath. And the contents of the legislation have not been subjected to serious hearings or searching examination.” Most Americans would be surprised to learn that since March 9, 1933, t he United States has been in a state of declared national emergency. In fact, until 1976, the USA operated under four presidentially proclaimed states of national emergency—the one declared by President Roo sevelt in 1933; a national emergency proclaimed by President Truman on Decem - ber 16, 1950, during the Korean confl i ct; and two states of national emer - gency declared by President Nixon, on March 23, 1970, and August 15, 1 971. Years of debate over the need for such emergency powers resulted in the creation in 1973 of the U.S. Senate’s Special Committee on the Ter - mination of the National Emergency. By 1976, the committee had c onsolidated the emergency declarations and produced the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601–1651), which limits such emergencies to two years. Th e S enate committee found that the weight of all these oft en - underreported proclamations “give[s] force to 470 provisions of federal la w.

Th is was quietly but officially declared by President George W.

In mid-2007, Bush codified the “shadow government” with the omi - nously worded National Security Presidential Directive/NSPD-51 and H omeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-20, innocently titled “National Continuity Policy.” In the interest of “continuity of govern - ment,” this directive stated, “the president shall lead the activities of the fed eral government for ensuring constitutional government.” Th e impli - cation was that he would lead the entire government, not just the execu - tive branch."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"PSYCHOLOGY AND PUBLIC CONTROL 339 Th is takeover of the federal government was contingent on a “cata - strophic emergency,” defined as “any incident, regardless of location, that r esults in extraordinary levels of mass casualties, damage, or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population, infrastructure, environment, econ - omy, or government functions.” Sharon Bradford Franklin, senior counsel at the Constitution Project, a b ipartisan think tank that promotes constitutional safeguards, said the policy’s definition “is so broad that it raises serious concerns about when and how this might be used to authorize unchecked executive action.” A L SO T ROU BL E SOM E I S Bush’s contention that he must defend his offi ce from the loss of power.

Volumes have been written about the Bush White House’s penchant fo r secrecy. It has almost become policy. Even conservative columnist Phyllis Schlafl y has attacked the Bush policy of unnecessary secrecy, writ - ing, “Th e A merican people do not and should not tolerate government by secrecy.” She added that no one is “going to buy the sanctimonious argu - ment that the Bush administration has some sort of duty to protect the po wer of the presidency.” “What the president is claiming is legally and historically absurd and politically stupid,” declared former Justice Depart - ment offi cia l Bruce Fein. Bush’s secretive manner of drawing ever more power unto himself came i n the form of “signing statements”—written responses by the president issued upon the signing of a bill into law. Such statements have drawn se - vere criticism from credible legal sources. Jennifer Van Bergen holds a law d egree from Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, is an adjunct faculty member at the New School for Social Research in New York, and is a member of the board of the ACLU Broward County (Florida) chapter. She criticized this activity by noting that from 1817 until the end of the Carter administration in 1981, only 75 “signing statements” were issued. From the Reagan administration until the end of the Clinton administra - tion, this number had grown to 322. But in the first term alone, Bush is - sued at least 435 signing statements, many noting his concept of a “unitary ex ecutive.” Such signing statements convey a president’s view toward the law and h is own power. Bush’s use of the term “unitary executive,” according to Van Bergen, is merely a code word for a doctrine “that favors nearly un - limited executive power.” “In [Bush’s] view, and the view of his administration, that doctrine g ives him license to overrule and bypass Congress or the courts, based on his own interpretations of the Constitution—even where that violates long-established laws and treaties, counters recent legislation that he has himself signed, or (as shown by recent developments in the Padilla case) involves off ering a federal court contradictory justifi cations for a deten - tion,” Van Bergen wrote."},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"PSYCHOLOGY AND PUBLIC CONTROL 341 Charlie Savage, writing in the Boston Globe, said Bush is the first presi - dent in modern history who has never vetoed a bill, thus giving Congress n o chance to override his judgments.

In his signing statements, Bush has repeatedly asserted that the Constitu - tion gives him the right to ignore numerous sections of the bills—some- ti mes including provisions that were the subject of negotiations with Congress in order to get lawmakers to pass the bill.” Van Bergen took particular note of Bush’s signing statement while he w as signing into law legislation curtailing torture on prisoners. “When President Bush signed the new law, sponsored by Senator [ John] McCain, restricting the use of torture when interrogating detainees, he also issued a presidential signing statement,” said Van Bergen. “Th at statement as - serted that his power as commander in chief gives him the authority to b ypass the very law he had just signed.” Portland State University law professor Phillip Cooper told newsmen Bus h and his legal team spent the past fi ve years quietly working to con - centrate ever more governmental power in the White House. “Th er e is no question that this administration has been involved in a very carefully thought out, systematic pro cess of expanding presidential power at the expense of the other branches of government.

Such unques - tioning loyalty and allegiance was a hallmark of the Th ir d Reich. Many loyalists around Nixon, Reagan, Clinton, and the two Bushes tr uly saw their leader as a paragon. They appeared blinded to their leader’s actions, as happened to so many in the Th ird Reich. “I admit, I was fasci - nated by Adolf Hitler,” recalled Traudl Junge, the last surviving occupant of the Fuehrerbunker, shortly before her death in 2002. She was twenty-two years old when, in 1942, she was selected to become a secretary to Hitler. “He was a pleasant boss and a fatherly friend,” she recalled. “I deliberately ignored all the warning voices inside me and enjoyed the time by his side almost until the bitter end. It wasn’t what he said, but the way he said things and how he did things.” Soon aft e r the War on Terror got underway, the Germans, who should know, could see the parallels between their Nazi era and modern America. Th e attacks of 9/11 and the Reichstag fire, Bush’s PATRIOT Act and Hitler’s Enabling Act, the use of German Army reserves to attack Poland and Bush’s use of reserves in Afghani stan and Iraq to avoid a military draft must have seemed quite familiar to them. German justice minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin brought heated criticism from President George W. Bush in September of 2002, when, in criticizing Bush’s policy in Iraq, s he stated publicly, “Bush wants to distract attention from his domestic problems. Th at’s a popular method. Even Hitler did that.” For her remark, Daeubler-Gmelin was asked to resign by German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, an attendee of Bilderberg meetings. And it is not just politicians who must be careful of voicing their opin- ions in the new American empire.

Many people complain that the major media are superfi cia l, conform - ist, and subjective in their selection of news. A Pew Research Center poll s howed respondents who thought news reporting unfair and inaccurate ranged into the 60 percentiles. A survey by the news industry publication Editor & Publisher showed that journalists themselves do not disagree. Nearly half of its participants indicated their belief that news coverage is shallow and inadequate. “Much of what is reported as ‘news’ is little more than the uncritical transmission of offi cial opinions to an unsuspecting public,” wrote Parenti. Fox news commentator Brit Hume stated, “What [the mass media] pass off as objectivity, is just a mindless kind of neutral - ity.” Hume added that reporters “shouldn’t try to be objective, they should tr y to be honest.” Hitler understood propaganda intuitively. He wrote in Me in Kampf: “[O]ne started out with the very correct assumption that in the size of the lie there is always contained a certain factor of credibility, since the great masses of people may fall victim to a great lie rather than a small one, since they themselves also lie sometimes in little things but would certainly be too ashamed to tell a great lie. Th us, it would not enter their heads to tell a great lie, and they would not believe that others could tell such an infa - mous lie; indeed, they will doubt and hesitate; even aft er learning the truth, they will continue to think there must be some other explanation; therefore, just for this reason, some part of the most impudent lie will re - main and stick, a fact which all great lying artists and societies of this w orld know only too well and therefore villainously employ.” Hitler was stating that most people are honest and would never tell a great lie; there - fore, it is hard for them to believe that anyone—esp ecia lly an admired leader—would tell one.

Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the b idding of the leaders. Th at is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.” Conspiracy researchers believe such methodology has been used on the American public. Ubiquitous propaganda remains a prime method for controlling public t hought and worldviews. Th e use of the public media to frame the issues of the day and bolster support for the government was quickly understood by Hitler and his top lieutenants. “It is no coincidence that the Ministry of Propaganda and Enlightenment became so important, or that Hitler was personally closest to Joseph Goebbels, the expert manipulator of mass opinion,” explained Professor George Mosse, author of Nazi Culture .

Th e I HC found that Bertelsmann particularly targeted wartime propaganda toward youngsters with series like Exciting Stories and the Christmas Book of the Hitler Youth. Bertelsmann’s history came under scrutiny in 1998, when the company t ook over Random House, the largest book publisher in the United States. In public announcements, the firm said it was closed down by the Nazis. Th e IHC, however, reported that this story was a “legend” and that the firm’s closure in 1944 was more likely due to shortages of material than any subversive activities.

Not according to studies by the nonpartisan Project for Excellence in Journalism. Th ey found that “hard” news stories, which constituted more than half of all news reports thirty years ago, today have fallen to less than one- third. Furthermore, story content today has moved away from discussions of the political pro cess, war and peace, and policy, to people, human interest, and news you can use. Th ere is also increasing emphasis on scandal, the bi - zarre, and fear of the future. Declining viewership and readership has become commonplace in the ma ss media and does not seem to overly concern corporate managers. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher and board chairman of the New York Times Company, recently stated: “I really don’t know whether we’ll be printing the Times in fi ve years, and you know what? I don’t care.” Increasingly, the attempt to present news objectively has given way to a dvocacy, which borders on sheer propaganda.

Th e N azis used the myth of Aryan brotherhood and superiority to cre - ate their National Socialist empire. In the United States, it has become t he myth of America’s God-ordained right to create an empire which has launched a worldwide war for American- style freedom and democracy. Today, numerous books and articles have been written about a new Amer - ican empire—or Reich, in German. “No one can argue credibly that A merica today is not an empire.

Th e cr eation of this empire has been facilitated by the power of the corporate mass media, increasingly falling into fewer and fewer hands.

Like Hitler, who sought to bring individuals alienated by the Indus - trial Revolution and Depression into a hive-like German Vo l k , or united people, the globalists who control America’s mass media have attempted to bring citizens into one common worldview by the unremitting dis - semination of homogeneous news and information. Networks and cable cha nnels routinely accept reports from “pool” reporters, which results in many channels presenting the same version of the news. Furthermore, news content has increasingly been simplifi ed down to the lowest com - mon denominator; 60 Minutes c orrespondent Morley Safer argued: “I challenge any viewer to make the distinction between [TV talk-show host] Jerry Springer and the three evening newses and CNN.” Only those who consciously tune in to alternative media or surf the Internet gain ac - cess to information diff e ring from the party line."},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"354 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Hitler achieved this conformity of thought among his followers through the use of radio, mass rallies, and meetings. Today, it is the corporate- controlled mass media that determines the worldview of most Americans. Th e corporate media owners, many of them members or close associates of the fascist globalists’ secret societies, have learned the lessons of Nazi media manipulation well—i.e., simplistic catchwords repeated constantly with no real opposing viewpoints allowed. For example, at the time of the Iraqi invasion, the corporate media called the enemy “insur - gents,” defined as anyone who opp osed t he established authority. Th is, of course, meant Iraqis opposed to the U.S. occupation, but the term “Iraqis” did not fi t well with government pronouncements about U.S. troops be - ing well received by that nation’s population. By 2007, the term “insur - gent” was being superseded by the term “al-Qaeda” in an effort to connect fig hting in Iraq to the attacks of September 11, 2001. Th is attempt came in the wake of President Bush’s admission that neither Saddam Hussein nor Iraq played any role in the attacks. Likewise, the mass media long and loudly has trumpeted the term “War on Terror,” with its attendant warn - ings to be watchful for terrorists trying to slip weapons of mass destruc - tion into the United States, yet noticeably failed to report that even seven ye ars aft er 9/11, no serious attempt has been made to secure the nation’s borders. Offi cial government pronouncements are merely broadcast un - critically, with very little eff o rt to check their reliability.

The attacks of 9/11 initially were compared to Pearl Harbor, and President Bush early on gar - nered criticism for calling his War on Terror a “crusade,” a term with ugly h istorical connotations. Th e sacrifi ces of wartime America during World War II were pointed to as models for the war against terrorism. Th e N azis brought complex social and economic issues down to one single concept—the Aryan German in a death struggle with the Interna - tional Jew.

Th e a rrogance of the Nazi mindset along with their accepted method for hoodwinking the public was voiced by an unnamed aide to President George W. Bush in 2002. In a New York Times Magazine article by Ron Suskind, this person referred to Suskind, and apparently all media report - ers, as living “in what we [the Bush administration] call the reality-based co mmunity.” Such persons, stated this presidential aide, “believe that so - lutions emerge from your j udicious study of discernible reality. . . .

Th e same can be said about literature, indeed all cultural endeavor.

But because of the tight corporate control over news and information in America, many citizens still have not been exposed to the controversies, contradictions, and unexplained events of 9/11. Despite attempts by both government and corporate leaders to deny t hat the attacks were anything but what was claimed, separate national polls show a growing number of Americans have declined to fully accept the offi cial explanation, which, when carefully examined, is nothing more than a conspiracy theory. In mid-June 2006, when questioned as to why Osama bin Laden’s Most Wanted poster did not include any mention of the"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"PROPAGANDA 357 9/11 attacks, Rex Tomb, FBI chief of Investigative Publicity, stated, “Th e rea- son why 9/11 is not mentioned on Osama bin Laden’s Most Wanted page is beca use the FBI has no hard evidence connecting bin Laden to 9/11” (emphasis added). Th e c onspiracy theory accepted by the Bush administration and the corporate mass media contends that nineteen fanatical Muslims somehow overcame the $40 billion U.S. defense system, simultaneously hijacked four commercial airliners, managing to disconnect their transponders at approximately the same time, and crashed them into the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon, with the fourth crashing in western Pennsylvania as the result of a revolt by the passengers—the entire opera - tion conducted under the command of a Muslim cleric using a computer i n a cave in Afghani stan. Zogby International poll results released in September 2007 showed t hat 90 percent of persons on the East Coast and 75 percent of those in the western United States believe the attacks of 9/11 have been the most signifi cant historical event of their lifetime. However, 65 percent of those polled gave President Bush’s attempts to combat terrorism negative marks, a dramatic drop from those who supported his eff orts just aft er 9/11. And despite the globalist control over the mass media, national polls, such as a September 2006 poll of more than 64,000 persons, have shown more than half the country has failed to buy into the offi cial story of the at - tacks. Only slight mass media coverage was given to a Zogby poll con - ducted between August 24 and 26, 2004, on the eve of the Republican Na tional Convention. Th e poll showed that almost one half of New York City residents (49.3 percent) and 41 percent of New York state residents believed that some national leaders “knew in advance that attacks were planned on or around September 11, 2001, and that they consciously failed to act.” Despite the political implications of such an accusation, nearly 30 percent of registered Republicans and more than 38 percent of those who described themselves as “very conservative” supported this proposition. A September 11, 2006, MSNBC Question of the Day poll asked, “Do you believe any 9/11 conspiracy theories that indicate the U.S. government was involved?” An astounding 58 percent answered, “Yes, I be - lieve there is evidence,” with only 30 percent voting “No, that’s ridiculous,”"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"358 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH and 11 percent stating, “I’m not sure.” Th is means a whopping 68 percent were at least open to the suggestion that 9/11 was contrived within the U. S. government. Much of this attitude was due to unanswered questions concerning the a ttacks, such as: ◆ Who was truly behind the creation of al-Qaeda, terrorists whose origins are connected to a Nazi intelligence organization and later the CIA? Recall it has been previously shown that al-Qaeda was taken over by Nazi intelligence before World War II and, af - ter the war, passed by British intelligence to the American CIA. ◆ Who authorized the war-game exercises for the morning of Sep - tember 11, 2001? Various exercises with names like Vigilant War - rior, Vigilant Guardian, Northern Vigilance, and Tripod II were b eing conducted by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NOR AD) and other government agencies that morning. According to Sergeant Lauro Chavez of the U.S. Cen - tral Command, these exercises included a scenario of hijacked c ommercial airliners being used to crash into prominent U.S. buildings, specifi cally naming the World Trade Center towers. Chavez, who worked with the command center’s computers, also noted that false images called “inputs” representing hijacked planes were placed on military radar screens, causing much initial con - fusion. Chavez said, much to the surprise of the military, it was a nnounced shortly before 9/11 that command over NOR AD, normally a military position, had been assumed by Vice President Cheney. ◆ Who sent the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s emer - gency response team and military rescue units to New York City a s part of the Tripod II exercises the evening before 9/11? ◆ Who authorized the flight of more than two dozen members of the bin Laden family across the United States during the “no fl y” period when Americans were not permitted to fl y? ◆ If a Boeing-757 with a wingspan of 124 feet and a height of 44 feet hit the Pentagon, why did photos taken the day prior to the"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"PROPAGANDA 359 collapse of the west wall show only one hole, approximately 15 × 20 feet, in the ground fl oor, with no evidence of wings, en - gines, or wheel assemblies? ◆ Who told New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani to evacuate his temporary command center because the Twin Towers were about to collapse, as he stated to Peter Jennings of ABC News that af - ternoon? ◆ Why has no other steel-reinforced building in the history of the world collapsed due to only fire, and why did the firefighting in - dustry publication Fi re Engineering describe the FEMA investi- gation of the towers collapse as “half-baked farce”? ◆ Why has there been such controversy over what caused the sym - metrical collapse of the forty-seven-story World Trade Center Bu ilding 7 at 5:25 P.

Th e cl iché that people and nations learn from history is not only overused, but also overestimated; oft en we fail to learn from history, or draw the wrong conclusions. Sadly, historical amnesia is the norm,” stated author Dr. Lau - rence W. Britt, in an article for Free Inquiry, a long- standing publication of the Council for Secular Humanism, which promotes secular humanist principles. Following a careful study of the regimes of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, F ranco’s Spain, Salazar’s Portugal, Papadopoulos’s Greece, Pinochet’s Chile, and Suharto’s Indonesia, Britt concluded that these fascist govern - ments had observable similarities. “Analysis of these seven regimes reveals f ourteen common threads that link them in recognizable patterns of na - tional behavior and abuse of power,” he noted. “Th ese ba sic characteristics are more prevalent and intense in some regimes than in others, but they all share at least some level of similarity.” Britt’s fourteen characteristics of a fascist regime, many sounding omi- nously close to what’s happening today in the United States, include: ◆ Powerful and continuing expressions of nationalism. From the prominent displays of fl a gs and bunting to the ubiq - uitous lapel pins, the fervor to show patriotic nationalism, both o n the part of the regime itself and of citizens caught up in its frenzy, was always obvious. Catchy slogans, pride in the military, and demands for unity were common themes in expressing this nationalism. It was usually coupled with a suspicion of things foreign that oft en bordered on xenophobia. Examples of such pa - triotic zeal may be found in the ever-present yellow ribbons show - ing support for U.S. troops to the plethora of American fl a gs and bunting at large public events such as the Super Bowl. ◆ Disdain for the importance of human rights. Th e r egimes themselves viewed human rights as of little value and a hindrance to realizing the objectives of the ruling elite. Th rough clever use of propaganda, the population was brought to accept these human rights abuses by marginalizing, even demon -"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"EPILOGUE 363 izing, those being targeted. When abuse was egregious, the tactic was to use secrecy, denial, and disinformation. In November 2007, former federal judge Michael B. Mukasey was sworn in as attorney general of the United States, despite contentious confir - mation hearings focused on the issue of torturing prisoners. He r eplaced Alberto R. Gonzales, who was criticized for his part in craft ing the Bush administration’s secretive legal arguments per - mitting the torture of suspects. Mukasey, who served eighteen y ears as judge of U.S. district court for the Southern District of New York, presided over the trials of Omar Abdel Rahman and El Sayyid Nosair, the convicted bombers of the World Trade Center in 1993; the trial of José Padilla, the man declared an “en - emy combatant” by President Bush and the only person convicted i n connection with the 9/11 attacks; and the lawsuits between World Trade Center leaser Larry Silverstein and several insur - ance companies over damages stemming from the 9/11 attacks. ◆ Identifi ca tion of enemies/scapegoats as a unifying cause. Th e m ost signifi cant common thread among these regimes was the use of scapegoating as a means to divert the people’s attention from other problems, to shift blame for failures, and to channel frustration in controlled directions. Th e methods of choice—re- lentless propaganda and disinformation—were usually eff ective. Oft en the regimes would incite “spontaneous” acts against the target scapegoats, usually communists, socialists, liberals, Jews, ethnic and racial minorities, traditional national enemies, mem - bers of other religions, secularists, homosexuals, and “terrorists.” A ctive opponents of these regimes were inevitably labeled as ter - rorists and dealt with accordingly. Examples of such tactics can be h eard from the mouths of those who constantly use racial slurs. Afghanistan’s former “freedom fighters” have semantically changed into “insurgents” then into “al-Qaeda terrorists” in the news columns, while such epitaphs as “rag head” and “sand nig - ger” are commonly used in the general population. ◆ Th e su premacy of the military and avid militarism. Ruling elites always identifi ed closely with the military and"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"364 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH the industrial infrastructure that supported it. A disproportion - ate share of national resources was allocated to the military, even w hen domestic needs were acute. Th e military was seen as an ex - pression of nationalism, and was used whenever possible to assert na tional goals, intimidate other nations, and increase the power and prestige of the ruling elite. Th e U.S. military budget for many years has consumed the bulk of the national spending. President Bush’s 2008 budget provides $439.3 billion for the Department of Defense’s base budget—a 7 percent increase over 2006 and a whopping 48 percent increase over 2001. Th is fi gure does not in - clude military-related expenditure such as nuclear weapons re - search or the wars in Afghani stan and Iraq. Neither does it count tr ust funds, anticipated costs of Social Security, and Veterans Ad - ministration costs of services to veterans. “Th e go vernment prac - tice of combining trust and federal funds began during the V ietnam War, thus making the human-needs portion of the bud - get seem larger and the military portion smaller,” according to l iterature from the War Resisters League (WRL), an antiwar or - ganization founded in 1923. By totaling all government fi gu res relating to the military, the WRL estimated that more than half (51 percent) of all federal spending goes to the military. ◆ Rampant sexism. Beyond the simple fact that the political elite and the national c ulture were male- dominated, these regimes inevitably viewed women as second-class citizens. Th ey were adamantly anti-abortion and also homophobic. Th ese attitudes were usually codified in dra - conian laws that enjoyed strong support by the orthodox religion of t he country, thus lending the regime cover for its abuses. Th is prac - tice is less prevalent in the United States today, although many w omen still fi nd it diffi cult to break through what has been termed the “glass ceiling,” in which they can see higher positions in the workplace but never seem to get there. Modern America also dif - fers from Nazi Germany and other cultures in that women are be - ginning to fill the corporate chairs formerly held by men. Many see m agreeable to advancing fascist and globalist philosophy."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"EPILOGUE 365 ◆ A controlled mass media. Under some of the regimes, the mass media were under strict d irect control and could be relied upon never to stray from the party line. Other regimes exercised more subtle power to ensure media orthodoxy. Methods included the control of licensing and access to resources, economic pressure, appeals to patriotism, and implied threats. Th e leaders of the mass media were oft en politi - cally compatible with the power elite. The result was usually suc - cessful in keeping the general public unaware of the regimes’ excesses. A s previously detailed, the American corporate mass media today is essentially in the hands of six giant multinational communica - tions corporations. Th e o wners of these corporations are propo - nents of “free trade” in business policies, yet coverage of alternative n ews and views is mostly ignored. “One of our best-kept secrets is the degree to which a handful of huge corporations control the flow of information in the United States. Whether it is television, radio, newspapers, magazines, books, or the Internet, a few giant conglomerates are determining what we see, hear, and read. And the situation is likely to become much worse as a result of radical deregulation eff orts by the Bush administration and some hor - rendous court decisions,” warned Congressman Bernie Sanders, ad ding, “Th is is an issue that Congress can no longer ignore.” ◆ Obsession with national security. Inevitably, a national security apparatus was under direct con - trol of the ruling elite. It was usually an instrument of oppression, o perating in secret and beyond any constraints. Its actions were justifi ed under the rubric of protecting “national security,” and questioning its activities was labeled unpatriotic or even trea - sonous. While all Americans should be concerned about national sec urity, many see it as a pretext to strip away constitutional rights. Th oughtful persons also worry about a man like Michael Chertoff , son of a Jewish rabbi, who has been accused of having dual citizenship (American and Israeli) and was a major architect of Bush administration policies, being named secretary of the Homeland Security Department."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"366 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH ◆ Religion and ruling elite tied together. Unlike communist regimes, the fascist and protofascist regimes w ere never proclaimed godless by their opponents. In fact, most of the regimes attached themselves to the predominant religion of the country and chose to portray themselves as militant defenders of that religion. Th e fact that the ruling elite’s behavior was in - compatible with the precepts of the religion was generally swept un der the rug. Propaganda kept up the illusion that the ruling elites were defenders of the faith and opponents of the “godless.” A perception was manufactured that opposing the power elite was tantamount to an attack on religion. Earlier in this work, the obvi - ous parallels have been drawn between the use of religion in Nazi G ermany and modern America to support government policies. ◆ Power of corporations protected. Although the personal life of ordinary citizens was under strict c ontrol, the ability of large corporations to operate in relative freedom was not compromised. Th e ruling elite saw the corporate structure as a way to not only ensure military production (in de - veloped states) but also as an additional means of social control. M embers of the economic elite were oft en pampered by the po - litical elite to ensure a continued mutuality of interests, especially i n the repression of “have-not” citizens. According to the Federal - ism Project of the American Enterprise Institute, a group that conduc ts and sponsors original research on American federalism, “Consumer advocates, plaintiff s’ attorneys, and state offi cials ar - gue that broad federal preemption claims—oft en by federal regu - latory agencies, without a clear congressional mandate—interfere w ith the states’ historic role in protecting citizens against corpo - rate misconduct. Corporations and federal agencies respond that pre emption is oft en the only viable safeguard against unwar - ranted state interferences with the national economy.” In a 2006 a rticle in the Los Angeles Times, Alan C. Miller and Myron Levin noted how a series of steps by federal agencies were meant to “shield leading industries from state regulation and civil lawsuits on the grounds that they conflict with federal authority.”"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"EPILOGUE 367 ◆ Power of labor suppressed or eliminated. Since organized labor was seen as the one power center that c ould challenge the political hegemony of the ruling elite and its corporate allies, it was inevitably crushed or made powerless. Th e poor formed an underclass that was viewed with suspicion or outright contempt. Under some regimes, being poor was consid - ered akin to a vice. As previously noted, antilabor actions of the B ush administration prompted Jack Heyman, an offi cial of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, to state that “Bush is effectively declaring war on the working class here.” Th ose with long memories know that labor news has largely dropped from the mainstream media’s radar screen. ◆ Disdain and suppression of intellectuals and the arts. Intellectuals, and the inherent freedom of ideas and expression as sociated with them, were anathema to these regimes. Intellec - tual and academic freedom were considered subversive to national sec urity and the patriotic ideal. Universities were tightly con - trolled, politically unreliable faculty harassed or eliminated. Un - orthodox ideas or expressions of dissent were strongly attacked, s ilenced, or crushed. To these regimes, art and literature had to serve the national interest or they had no right to exist. In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, many conservative groups on college campuses denounced academic freedom, according to a report by John K. Wilson, coordinator of the Independent Press Associa- tion’s Campus Journalism Project. Other academics were fired or reprimanded for merely speaking out on the issues of war or ques- tioning the offi cia l story of 9/11. ◆ Obsession with crime and punishment. Most of these regimes maintained draconian systems of crimi - nal justice, with huge prison populations. Th e po lice were oft en glorifi ed and had almost unchecked power, leading to rampant abuse. “Normal” and political crime were oft en merged into trumped-up criminal charges and sometimes used against politi - cal opponents of the regime.

Th e United States today has a higher incarcer - ated population than all Europe an jails combined, and in certain ar eas, such as Washington, D.C., police presence is at an all-time high. One visitor to Washington in the summer of 2007 asked a police offi cer why there were so many cops around. He replied, “People would rather have security than freedom.” ◆ Rampant cronyism and corruption. Th ose i n business circles and close to the power elite oft en used their position to enrich themselves. Th is corruption worked both ways: the power elite would receive financial gift s and property from the economic elite, who in turn would gain the benefi t of government favoritism. Members of the power elite were in a po - sition to obtain vast wealth from other sources as well: for exam - ple, by stealing national resources. With the national security a pparatus under control and the media muzzled, this corruption was largely unconstrained and not well understood by the general population. Th e cronyism and outright nepotism of the Bush ad - ministration has been well documented. Elizabeth Cheney, the v ice president’s daughter, was named as a deputy secretary of state in late February 2002, and within about a week, her husband, Philip Perry, became chief counsel for the Offi ce of Management and Budget, where he joined director Mitchell Daniels, whose sister Deborah is an assistant attorney general. “Th at’s just the beginning,” noted Wa s h i n g t o n Po s t reporter Dana Milbank. “Among Deborah Daniels’ colleagues at Justice is young Chuck James, whose mother, Kay Coles James, is the director of the Of - fice o f Personnel Management, and whose father, Charles Sr., is a top Labor Department offi cial.

An informal survey of 415 historians conducted by George Mason University’s History News Network found that eight in ten, or 81 percent, of the responding historians rated Bush’s presidency as an overall failure. One respondent to the survey wrote that Bush “ranks with U. S. Grant as the worst. His oil interests and Cheney’s corporate Halliburton contracts smack of the same corruption found under Grant.” Central to this belief were the numerous Bush administration scandals, including the deceit that preceded the invasion of Iraq; the Abu Ghraib mis- treatment of prisoners; pre-9/11 intelligence failures; the $2.3 tr illion missing from the Pentagon, announced by Donald Rums- feld the day before 9/11; the mishandling of the Katrina disaster, wh ich resulted in the resignation of Bush’s appointee Michael D. Brown as director of FEMA; Bush’s Medicare prescription drug plan that shift ed 6.2 million low-income seniors whose medi - cations had been covered by Medicare over to private insurers; t he noncompetition government contracts to Halliburton, Dick Cheney’s former employer; and the substitution of political ideals for science. In 2004, the Union of Concerned Scientists issued a statement blasting the administration’s politicization of science. Ultimately, this statement was signed by 4,062 scientists, includ - ing 51 Nobel laureates, 63 National Medal of Science recipients, a nd 195 members of the National Academies. Buzzfl ash.com, which styles itself as marketplace for progressives, aft er listing several debacles and scandals of the Bush administration, said it operated in a “culture of cronyism and corruption.” ◆ Fraudulent elections. Elections in the form of plebiscites or public opinion polls w ere usually bogus. When actual elections with candidates were held, they would, as a rule, be perverted by the power elite to get the desired result. Common methods included maintaining con - trol of the election machinery, intimidating and disenfranchising o pposition voters, destroying or disallowing legal votes, and, as a last resort, turning to a judiciary beholden to the power elite."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"370 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Americans are well aware of the controversies concerning the presidential elections of 2000 and 2004. George W. Bush’s fi rst term was decided by the Supreme Court, not the voters. And it was just as bad in 2004. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., writing in Rolling Stone magazine, stated, “Republicans prevented more than 350,000 voters in Ohio from casting ballots or having their votes counted—enough to have put John Kerry in the White House.” Controversy over both elections continues today and in 2008 charges of vote fraud were already being voiced in the state pri - mary elections, primarily over computer voting machines. Many Americans noticed the similarities between George W. Bush’s un - provoked attacks on Afghanistan and Iraq and Hitler’s unprovoked attacks o n Poland, the Low Countries, and France. In both cases, the pretext for in - vasion proved false and reservists were used rather than the option to re - sort to a military draft . In early 2008, a study by the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity d ocumented 935 “false statements” by the Bush administration in the months leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. “Nearly fi ve years aft er the U.S. invasion of Iraq, an exhaustive examination of the record shows that the statements were part of an orchestrated campaign that eff ectively galvanized public opinion and, in the pro cess, led the nation to war under decidedly false pretenses,” stated the CPI report.

Historical comparisons like these are just exercises in verbal gymnastics.

But when secular humanists, conservative Christians, Jews, liberal Democrats, bedrock Republicans, and moderates, not to mention the activist fringe elements, all start issu - ing the same warning against fascism, perhaps it is time we start paying se rious attention. Commentators like Noam Chomsky and Gore Vidal have spoken out against the “national security state” from the left . Th e late Senator Barry Goldwater and evangelist Pat Robertson have spoken out from the right. Even mainstream centrists, like commentator Bill Moyers and attorney Gerry Spence, have warned of the abuses of a “secret govern - ment.” When historical fi g ures along with concerned citizens from oppo - site ends of the political spectrum all say the same thing, it is time to c onsider the true state of the American union. And perhaps time to stand up and be counted for true freedom—freedom from the corporate state. Th e Reverend Erwin W.

How - ever, if the German church has taught us the dangers of blind obedience t o government, we must eschew the mindless philosophy ‘My country, right or wrong.’ ” Media critic Michael Parenti observes, “To oppose the policies of a gov - ernment does not mean you are against the country or the people that the g overnment supposedly represents. Such opposition should be called what it really is: democracy, or democratic dissent, or having a critical perspec - tive about what your leaders are doing.

Th at’s just what the Germans did with Hitler, and look where it got them.” Th e re are those who would argue that it is perhaps unpatriotic or at least not politically correct to speak out on issues involving taxation, immigration, political beliefs, race, eugenics, or criticism of the military- industrial complex.

Th is is the same self-imposed restriction that was adopted by too many Germans during the Th ird Reich. Not only was the man on the street afraid to speak out against the Nazi regime but free speech was denied the intelligentsia. Nazi academic Walter Schultze in 1939 stated that “the reorganization of the entire university system must begin with people who understand that freedom has limits and con - form to National Socialist thinking.” Germans in the Th i rd Reich did not know the term “political correctness,” but they well understood the penal - ties for freely voicing their opinions. Recent legislation targeting so- called hate speech can easily slip into offi cia l punitive action against any speech that arouses the ire of politi - cians, police, or judges. Jonathan Rauch writing in Ha rper’s magazine noted that equating verbal violence with physical violence is a “treacher - ous, mischievous business.” Rauch quoted author Salman Rushdie, who w as sentenced to death in absentia by Muslim ayatollahs aft er writing a book they claimed slandered the beliefs of millions of Muslims. “What is freedom of expression?” asked Salman Rushdie. “Without the freedom to off end, it ceases to exist.” Rauch wrote that the public should learn a les - son from Rushdie’s experience. Rauch proclaimed: “The campaigns to e radicate prejudice—all of them, the speech codes and workplace restric - tions and mandatory therapy for accused bigots and all the rest—should st op, now. The whole objective of eradicating prejudice, as opposed to cor - recting and criticizing it, should be repudiated as a fool’s errand.” Even though the German Nazis preached the unity of the Vo l k and spoke out against the old divisions of class and education, the leaders op - erated in an entirely diff e rent manner. “In reality, the Th ird Reich was a network of rival leaders, each with his own followers and his own patron - age,” noted George Mosse in his book N azi Culture . “Hitler kept them competing against one another and in this way was able to control the whole leadership structure.”"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"EPILOGUE 373 Likewise, the globalist rulers of America pit bureaucrats, politicians, academics, corporate leaders, and the public against one another in an agenda of divide and conquer.

Consequently, there has not been one prominent fi gure in re - cent American history who has commanded the popular respect and es - teem of a majority of the population. Even the assassinated President John F. Kennedy, beloved by so many, never held popular goodwill to the ex - tent of Franklin D. Roo sevelt. Since World War II, no national leader has g ained the stature of Roo sevelt, Churchill, or Hitler. “Hitler’s world has gone forever. But many of the basic attitudes and p rejudices which went into his worldview are still with us, waiting to be actualized, to be directed into a new mass consciousness,” prophesied Pro - fessor Mosse from the relatively naive year of 1966. Ladislas Farago, author of Aft e rmath: Martin Bormann and the Fourth Reich, wrote: “Th e despicable forces loosed by the Th ird Reich are not ex - punged, although, like some virulent virus, they may have changed to o ther forms and be diffi cult to identify. Th ey remain malignant and as potentially dangerous as before.” In his 1997 book Th e Beast Reawakens, Martin Lee wrote, “Fascism is on the march again . . . . unchecked corpo - rate power has, to a signifi ca nt degree, stultifi ed the democratic process, and fascist groups in Europe and the United States feed upon this ma - laise.” Th ese se ntiments came from writers unaware of the fascist glo - balists’ plan being woven around them. Yet, they could sense that A mericans could easily fall sway to the pernicious ideolog y of National Socialism. T H E BIG GE ST S T U M BL I NG block to the plans of the globalists has always been the United States, with its tradition of individual freedom, its Con - stitution that guarantees that freedom, and the fact that so many"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"374 THE RISE OF THE FOURTH REICH Americans own firearms to protect their freedoms. But true freedom is a transient quality. National politicians no longer refer to the “republic,” because modern A merica has ceased to be one. It is now an empire—a new Reich. Obviously, there are dissimilarities between Hitler’s Th i rd Reich and the new American Reich. Aft er all, the United States today is a very dif - ferent time and culture. But it has been demonstrated how the same phi - losophies and methodologies employed by the same families, corporations, a nd organizations that at one time supported Hitler’s Th ird Reich, have now found roots in modern America. It has been necessary for these fascist globalists to break up the United S tates into divisions of race, sex, age, generation and culture. Th is has been accomplished through a degrading of popular culture, downgrading the education pro cess, permitting a steady fl ow of illegal immigrants, and the fragmentation of the population over issues such as abortion, immi - gration, nonheterosexual relationships, and foreign policy. Control over a d iminished national economy and corporate downsizing has brought un - due stress on workers, resulting in the gradual destruction of the nuclear fa mily. None of this construction of the new American empire has come about su ddenly. Th e g lobal National Socialists—Nazis—are in it for the long haul. Th e own ers of the multinational corporations, with their membership in se - cret societies, know their goals will not be achieved overnight, although s ince 9/11 they seem to have redoubled their efforts, speeding up the time - table. While businessmen deal with yearly quarters, and the average worker l ives for his weekly paycheck, these people look ahead fift y years or a hun - dred, if that’s what it takes. Th e y realize that their program of a global fascist socialism is the only means of maintaining their power and con - trol, the only way—in their view—to maintain the purity of their race a nd class. Th ey laugh at the concepts of true individual freedom and mul - ticulturalism, for they have no faith in the innate goodness of humankind o r its ability for self-government. Th ey have no real faith in God and use religious ideals and concepts merely as another tool for social control.

Sacrifi ces and change will have to be made in all areas of society. Lifestyles will have to be altered. But it can be done—hopefully before the United States falls into depression, anarchy, and then a police state. New energy sources and technologies are lurking in the wings. Tech - nological breakthroughs await only the change of attitude on the part of c onventional politics, commerce, and finance. A sea change in the public consciousness is well under way, although it is n ot refl ected in the corporate-controlled mass media. Yet it is happen - ing. Informed consumers are beginning to realize they can vote with their s pending. If enough people refuse to buy a certain product—whether it’s a brand of car, gasoline, or something else—or even reject a federal policy proposal, it can force a change of direction in the controllers. We may do well to recall the words of President Franklin D. Roo sevelt, wh o had to deal with a previous “New World Order.” In a 1940 address, he stated, “Th e history of recent years proves that the shootings and the chains and the concentration camps are not simply the transient tools but the very altars of modern dictatorships. Th ey may talk of a ‘new order’ in the world, but what they have in mind is only a revival of the oldest and the worst tyranny. In that there is no liberty, no religion, no hope. Th e proposed ‘new order’ is the very opposite of a United States of Europe or a United States of Asia. It is not a government based upon the consent of the governed. It is not a union of ordinary, self-respecting men and women to protect themselves and their freedom and their dignity from oppres- sion. It is an unholy alliance of power and self to dominate and to enslave t he human race.” It appears that the “New World Order” is really just the “Old World Or der” packaged with modern advertising slickness—new names, logos, and slogans. What once was traditional American conservatism has been molded into fascist forms, beginning with the infusion of National So - cialism ideals into the military-industrial complex, which then spread into sci ence, corporate life, the mass media, and even political parties. Th is cha nge has been engineered by the globalist elite who hold mo - nopolies over basic resources, energy, pharmaceuticals, transportation, a nd telecommunications, including the news media.

With the defeat of the Germans, they simply shift ed their attention to the United States. Th ey were abetted by Nazis financed by the stolen wealth of Europe—perhaps including Solomon’s treasure—and utilizing a vast network of worldwide corporations. Th ousands of Nazis escaped to both North and South America, their way facilitated by sup - porters in Wall Street, the Bank of En gland, and the Vatican. Using German advances in the study of the human mind, behavior, a nd propaganda, these self-styled globalists are now attempting to subdue the American population through a maze of government policies, drugs, a dumbed-down education system, and a controlled corporate mass media. Political and corporate leadership continually swap roles, creating a merger of the state and industry—the very definition of fascism. Mergers and leveraged takeovers have concentrated corporate power into fewer and fewer hands, many of those directly connected through banking and cor - porate ties to prewar support for the Nazis. Law enforcement personnel i ncreasingly no longer wear the blue uniforms of police sworn “to serve and protect,” but black body armor with the German-style military hel - mets, initially dubbed the “Fritz” by the soldiers. Even the fi el ds of reli - gion, education, and entertainment are being used to transform whole ge nerations of formerly free Americans into cowed and subservient mem - bers of an increasingly National Socialist system. Is the new American Empire, as it is described in numerous books and a rticles, in danger of becoming an empire of the wealthy—a fascist Fourth Reich? Hitler’s Th ousand-year Reich collapsed aft er a mere twelve years. How long before the end of the New World Order’s Fourth Reich in America?
