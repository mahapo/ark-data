It isabout how dark truths can be hidden from the public by U.S. officials in thename of national security, and it is about the unpredictable, often fortuitous,circumstances through which truth gets revealed.Operation Paperclip was a postwar U.S. intelligence program that brought Germanscientists to America under secret military contracts. The program had a benignpublic face and a classified body of secrets and lies. “I’m mad on technology[endnotes.xhtml#en0001],” Adolf Hitler told his inner circle at a dinner partyin 1942, and in the aftermath of the German surrender more than sixteen hundredof Hitler’s technologists would become America’s own. What follows puts aspotlight on twenty-one of these men.Under Operation Paperclip, which began in May of 1945, the scientists who helpedthe Third Reich wage war continued their weapons-related work for the U.S.government, developing rockets, chemical and biological weapons, aviation andspace medicine (for enhancing military pilot and astronaut performance), andmany other armaments at a feverish and paranoid pace that came to define theCold War. The age of weapons of mass destruction had begun, and with it came thetreacherous concept of brinkmanship—the art of pursuing dangerous policy to thelimits of safety before stopping. Hiring dedicated Nazis was without precedent,entirely unprincipled, and inherently dangerous not just because, asUndersecretary of War Robert Patterson stated when debating if he should approvePaperclip, “These men are enemies [endnotes.xhtml#en0002],” but because it wascounter to democratic ideals. The men profiled in this book were not nominalNazis. Eight of the twenty-one—Otto Ambros, Theodor Benzinger, Kurt Blome,Walter Dornberger, Siegfried Knemeyer, Walter Schreiber, Walter Schieber, andWernher von Braun—each at some point worked side by side with Adolf Hitler,Heinrich Himmler, or Hermann Göring during the war. Fifteen of the twenty-onewere dedicated members of the Nazi Party; ten of them also joined theultra-violent, ultra-nationalistic Nazi Party paramilitary squads, the SA(Sturmabteilung, or Storm Troopers) and the SS (Schutzstaffel, or ProtectionSquadron); two wore the Golden Party Badge, indicating favor bestowed by theFührer; one was given an award of one million reichsmarks for scientificachievement.Six of the twenty-one stood trial at Nuremberg, a seventh was released withouttrial under mysterious circumstances, and an eighth stood trial in Dachau forregional war crimes. One was convicted of mass murder and slavery, served sometime in prison, was granted clemency, and then was hired by the U.S. Departmentof Energy. They came to America at the behest of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Someofficials believed that by endorsing the Paperclip program they were acceptingthe lesser of two evils—that if America didn’t recruit these scientists, theSoviet Communists surely would. Other generals and colonels respected andadmired these men and said so.To comprehend the impact of Operation Paperclip on American national securityduring the early days of the Cold War, and the legacy of war-fighting technologyit has left behind, it is important first to understand that the program wasgoverned out of an office in the elite “E” ring of the Pentagon. The JointIntelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) was created solely and specifically torecruit and hire Nazi scientists and put them on weapons projects and inscientific intelligence programs within the army, the navy, the air force, theCIA (starting in 1947), and other organizations. In some cases, when individualscientists had been too close to Hitler, the JIOA hired them to work at U.S.military facilities in occupied Germany. The JIOA was a subcommittee of theJoint Intelligence Committee (JIC), which provided national security informationfor the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The JIC remains the least known and least studiedU.S. intelligence agency of the twentieth century. To understand the mind-set ofthe Joint Intelligence Committee, consider this: Within one year of the atomicbombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the JIC warned the Joint Chiefs of Staff[endnotes.xhtml#en0003] that the United States needed to prepare for “total war”with the Soviets—to include atomic, chemical, and biological warfare—and theyeven set an estimated start date of 1952. This book focuses on that uneasyperiod, from 1945 to 1952, in which the JIOA’s recruitment of Nazi scientistswas forever on the rise, culminating in Accelerated Paperclip, which allowedindividuals previously deemed undesirable to be brought to the UnitedStates—including Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber, the surgeon general[endnotes.xhtml#en0004] of the Third Reich.Operation Paperclip left behind a legacy of ballistic missiles, sarin gas[endnotes.xhtml#en0005] cluster bombs, underground bunkers, space capsules, andweaponized bubonic plague. It also left behind a trail of once-secret documentsthat I accessed to report this book, including postwar interrogation reports,army intelligence security dossiers, Nazi Party paperwork, Allied intelligencearmaments reports, declassified JIOA memos, Nuremberg trial testimony, oralhistories, a general’s desk diaries, and a Nuremberg war crimes investigator’sjournal. Coupled with exclusive interviews and correspondence with children andgrandchildren of these Nazi scientists, five of whom shared with me the personalpapers and unpublished writings of their family members, what follows is theunsettling story of Operation Paperclip.All of the men profiled in this book are now dead. Enterprising achievers asthey were, just as the majority of them won top military and science awards whenthey served the Third Reich, so it went that many of them won top U.S. militaryand civilian awards serving the United States. One had a U.S. governmentbuilding named after him, and, as of 2013, two continue to have prestigiousnational science prizes given annually in their names. One invented the earthermometer. Others helped man get to the moon.How did this happen, and what does this mean now? Does accomplishment cancel outpast crimes? These are among the central questions in this dark and complicatedtale. It is a story populated with Machiavellian connivers and men who dedicatetheir lives to designing weapons for the coming war. It is also a story aboutvictory, and what victory can often entail. It is rife with Nazis, many of whomwere guilty of accessory to murder but were never charged, and lived out theirlives in prosperity in the United States. In the instances where a kind ofjustice is delivered, it rings of half-measure.Or perhaps there is a hero in the record of fact, which continues to be filledin."},{"pageContent":"PART I [toc.xhtml#toc-part001]“Only the dead have seen the end of war.”—Unknown"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter001]THE WAR AND THE WEAPONS [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter001]It was November 26, 1944, and Strasbourg, France, was still under attack. Thecobblestone streets of this medieval city were in chaos. Three days before, theSecond French Armored Division had chased the Germans out of town and officiallyliberated the city from the Nazis, but now the Allies were having a difficulttime [endnotes.xhtml#en0006] holding the enemy back. German mortar roundsbombarded the streets. Air battles raged overhead [endnotes.xhtml#en0007], andin the center of town, inside a fancy apartment on Quai Klébar, armed U.S.soldiers guarded [endnotes.xhtml#en0008] the Dutch-American particle physicistSamuel Goudsmit as he sat in an armchair scouring files. The apartment belongedto a German virus expert named Dr. Eugen Haagen, believed to be a key developerin the covert Nazi biological weapons program. Haagen had apparently fled hisapartment in a hurry just a few days prior, leaving behind a framed photographof Hitler on the mantel and a cache of important documents in the cabinets[endnotes.xhtml#en0009].Goudsmit and two colleagues, bacteriological warfare experts Bill Cromartie andFred Wardenberg [endnotes.xhtml#en0010], had been reading over Dr. Haagen’sdocuments for hours. Based on what was in front of them, they planned to be hereall night. Most of Strasbourg was without electricity, so Goudsmit and hiscolleagues were reading by candlelight.Samuel Goudsmit led a unit engaged in a different kind of battle than the onebeing fought by the combat soldiers and airmen outside. Goudsmit and his teamwere on the hunt for Nazi science—German weaponry more advanced than what theAllies possessed. Goudsmit was scientific director of this Top Secret mission,code-named Operation Alsos, an esoteric and dangerous endeavor that was anoffshoot of the Manhattan Project. Goudsmit and his colleagues were far moreaccustomed to working inside a laboratory than on a battlefield, and yet herethey were, in the thick of the fight. It was up to these men of science todetermine just how close the Third Reich was to waging atomic, biological, orchemical warfare against Allied troops. This was called A-B-C warfare by Alsos.An untold number of lives depended on the success of the operation.Samuel Goudsmit had qualities that made him the mission’s ideal sciencedirector. Born in Holland, he spoke Dutch and German fluently. At agetwenty-three he had become famous among fellow physicists for identifying theconcept of electron spin. Two years later he earned his PhD at the University ofLeiden and moved to America to teach. During the war, Goudsmit worked on weaponsdevelopment through a government-sponsored lab at MIT. This gave him uniqueinsight into the clandestine world of atomic, biological, and chemical warfareand had put him in this chair, reading quickly in the flickering candlelight.Just days before, Goudsmit’s team had captured four of Hitler’s top nuclearscientists and had learned from them that the Nazis’ atomic bomb project hadbeen a failure. This was an unexpected intelligence coup for Alsos—and a hugerelief. The focus now turned to the Reich’s biological weapons program, rumoredto be well advanced.Goudsmit and his team of Alsos agents knew that the University of Strasbourg hadbeen doubling as a biological warfare research base for the Third Reich. Once abastion of French academic prowess, this four-hundred-year-old university hadbeen taken over by the Reich Research Council [endnotes.xhtml#en0011], HermannGöring’s science organization, in 1941. Since then, the university had beentransformed into a model outpost of Nazi science. Most of the university’sprofessors had been replaced with men who were members of the Nazi Party[endnotes.xhtml#en0012] and of Heinrich Himmler’s SS.On this November night, Goudsmit made the decision to have his team set up campin Professor Haagen’s apartment [endnotes.xhtml#en0013] and read all thedocument [endnotes.xhtml#en0017]s in a straight shot. Alsos security teammembers set their guns aside, organized a meal of K-rations on the dining roomtable [endnotes.xhtml#en0014], and settled in to a long night of cards. Goudsmitand the biological weapons experts Cromartie and Wardenberg sat back inProfessor Haagen’s easy chairs and worked on getting through all the files.Night fell and it began to snow, adding confusion to the scene outside. Hourspassed.Then Goudsmit and Wardenberg “let out a yell at the same moment,” rememberedGoudsmit, “for we had both found papers that suddenly raised the curtain ofsecrecy for us.” There in Professor Haagen’s apartment, “in apparently harmlesscommunication, lay hidden a wealth of secret information available to anyone whounderstood it.” Goudsmit was not deciphering code. The papers were not stampedTop Secret. “They were just the usual gossip [endnotes.xhtml#en0015] betweencolleagues… ordinary memos,” Goudsmit recalled. But they were memos that werenever meant to be found by American scientists. The plan was for the Third Reichto rule for a thousand years.“Of the 100 prisoners you sent me,” Haagen wrote to a colleague at theuniversity, an anatomist named Dr. August Hirt, “18 died in transport. Only 12are in a condition suitable for my experiments. I therefore request that yousend me another 100 prisoners, between 20 and 40 years of age, who are healthyand in a physical condition comparable to soldiers. Heil Hitler, Prof. Dr. E.Haagen [endnotes.xhtml#en0016].” The document was dated November 15, 1943.For Samuel Goudsmit the moment was a stunning reveal. Here, casually tucked awayin a group of Haagen’s personal papers, he had discovered one of the mostdiabolical secrets of the Third Reich. Nazi doctors were conducting medicalexperiments on healthy humans. This was new information to the scientificcommunity. But there was equally troubling information in the subtext of theletter as far as biological weapons were concerned. Haagen was a virus expertwho specialized in creating vaccines. The fact that he was involved in humanmedical experiments made a kind of twisted sense to Goudsmit in a way that fewothers could interpret. In order to successfully unleash a biological weaponagainst an enemy force, the attacking army had to have already created its ownvaccine against the deadly pathogen it intended to spread. This vaccine wouldact as the shield for its own soldiers and civilians; the biological weaponwould act as the sword. The document Goudsmit was looking at was a little morethan a year old. How much vaccine progress had the Nazis made since?As Goudsmit stared at the documents in front of him, he was faced with atroubling reality [endnotes.xhtml#en0018]. Once, Eugen Haagen had been atemperate man—a physician dedicated to helping people. In 1932 Dr. Haagen hadbeen awarded a prestigious fellowship by the Rockefeller Foundation, in New YorkCity, where he had helped to develop the world’s first yellow fever vaccine. In1937 he had been a contender for the Nobel Prize. Haagen had been one ofGermany’s leading men of medicine. Now here he was testing deadly vaccines ononce healthy prisoners from concentration camps supplied to him by Himmler’s SS.If a leading doctor like Haagen had been able to conduct these kinds of researchexperiments with impunity, what else might be going on?Goudsmit and his colleagues scoured Dr. Haagen’s papers, paying particularattention to the names of the doctors with whom Haagen corresponded about hisprisoner shipments, his vaccine tests, and his future laboratory plans. Goudsmitstarted putting together a list of Nazi scientists who were now top prioritiesfor Alsos to locate, capture, and interview. Dr. Eugen Haagen would never becomea Paperclip scientist. After the war he would flee to the Soviet zone ofoccupation in Germany and work for the Russians. But among the names discoveredin his apartment were two physicians important to Operation Paperclip. They wereDr. Kurt Blome, deputy surgeon general of the Third Reich, and Surgeon GeneralWalter Schreiber. Dr. Blome was in charge of the Reich’s biological weaponsprograms; Dr. Schreiber was in charge of its vaccines. The sword and the shield[endnotes.xhtml#en0019].Before Hitler rose to power, Blome and Schreiber had been internationallyrenowned physicians. Had Nazi science also made monsters of these men?Almost two weeks after the Alsos mission’s discovery at Strasbourg, threehundred miles to the north, in Germany, a party was under way. There, deep inthe dark pine forests of Coesfeld, a magnificent moated eight-hundred-year-oldstone castle called Varlar was being readied for a celebration[endnotes.xhtml#en0020]. The castle was a medieval showpiece of the Münsterregion, resplendent with turrets, balustrades, and lookout towers. On thisnight, December 9, 1944, the banquet hall had been decorated in full Nazi Partyregalia. Trellises of ivy graced the podium. Flags featuring Germany’s nationaleagle-and-swastika emblem hung from walls, a motif repeated in each china placesetting [endnotes.xhtml#en0021] where the guests of the Third Reich celebratedand dined.Outside, on Castle Varlar’s grounds, the snow-covered fields were also beingreadied. For centuries the castle had been a monastery, its broad lawns used assacred spaces for Benedictine monks to stroll about and consider God. Now, inthe frigid December cold, army technicians made last-minute adjustments to themetal platforms of portable rocket-launch pads. On each sat a missile called theV-2.The giant V-2 rocket was the most advanced flying weapon ever created. It was 46feet long, carried a warhead filled with up to 2,000 pounds of explosives in itsnose cone, and could travel a distance of 190 miles at speeds up to five timesthe speed of sound. Its earlier version, the V-1 flying bomb, had been rainingterror down on cities across northern Europe since the first one hit London, onJune 13, 1944. The V-2 rocket was faster and more fearsome. No Allied fighteraircraft could shoot down the V-2 from the sky, both because of the altitude atwhich it traveled and the speed of its descent. The specter of it crashing downinto population centers, annihilating whoever or whatever happened to be there,was terrifying. “The reverberations from each [V-2] rocket explosion spread upto 20 miles,” the Christian Science Monitor reported [endnotes.xhtml#en0022].The V-weapons bred fear. Since the start of the war, Hitler had boasted aboutfearsome “hitherto unknown, unique weapons [endnotes.xhtml#en0023]” that wouldrender his enemies defenseless. Over time, and with the aid of PropagandaMinister Joseph Goebbels, references to these mysterious weapons had beenconsolidated in a singular, terrifying catchphrase: Nazi wonder weapons, orWunderwaffe. Now, throughout the summer and fall of 1944, the V-weapons made thethreat a reality. That the Nazis had unfurled a wonder weapon of such power andpotential this late in the war made many across Europe terrified about what elseHitler might have. Plans to evacuate one million civilians from London’s citycenter were put in place as British intelligence officers predicted that a nextgeneration of V-weapons might carry deadly chemical or biological weapons in thenose cone. England issued 4.3 million gas masks to its city dwellers and toldpeople to pray.Major General Walter Dornberger was the man in charge of the rocket programs[endnotes.xhtml#en0024] for the German army’s weapons department. Dornberger wassmall, bald on top, and when he appeared in photographs alongside Himmler heoften wore a long, shin-length leather coat to match the Reichsführer-SS. He wasa career soldier—this was his second world war. He was also a talented engineer.Dornberger held four patents in rocket development and a degree in engineeringfrom the Institute of Technology in Berlin. He was one of four honored guests atthe Castle Varlar party. Later, he recalled the scene. “Around the castle in thedark forest [endnotes.xhtml#en0025] were the launching positions of V-2 troopsin [our] operation against Antwerp.” It had been Dornberger’s idea to set upmobile launch pads, as opposed to firing V-2s from fortified bases in theReich-controlled part of France—a wise idea, considering Allied forces had beenpushing across the continent toward Germany since the Normandy landings in June.Antwerp was Belgium’s bustling, northernmost port city, located just 137 milesaway from the V-2 launch pads at Castle Varlar. For a thousand years it had beena strategic city in Western Europe, conquered and liberated more than a dozentimes. In this war Belgium had suffered terrible losses under four long years ofbrutal Nazi rule. Three months prior, on September 4, 1944, the Allies liberatedAntwerp. There was joy in the streets when the British Eleventh Armored Divisionrolled into town. Since then, American and British forces had been relyingheavily on the Port of Antwerp to bring in men and matériel to support fightingon the western front and also to prepare for the surge into Germany. Now, in thesecond week of December 1944, Hitler intended to reclaim Antwerp. The Führer andhis inner circle were preparing to launch their last, still secretcounteroffensive in the Ardennes Forest, and for this the German army neededAntwerp shut down. The job fell to the V-2. The party at Castle Varlar was to bea night of warfare and celebration, with one 42,000-pound liquid-fueled rocketbeing fired off at the enemy after the next, while the guests honored four ofthe men who had been instrumental in building the wonder weapon for the Reich.The man at the scientific center of the V-2 rocket program was athirty-two-year-old aristocrat and wunderkind-physicist [endnotes.xhtml#en0026]named Wernher von Braun. Von Braun was at Castle Varlar to receive, alongsideDornberger, one of Hitler’s highest and most coveted noncombat decorations, theKnight’s Cross of the War Service Cross [endnotes.xhtml#en0027]. Also receivingthe honor [endnotes.xhtml#en0028] were Walther Riedel, the top scientist in therocket design bureau, and Heinz Kunze, a representative from the Reich’sarmaments ministry. These four medals were to be presented by Albert Speer,Hitler’s minister of armaments and war production.Armaments are the aggregate of a nation’s military strength, and as minister ofweapons, Speer was in charge of scientific armaments programs for the ThirdReich. He joined the Nazi Party in 1931, at the age of twenty-six, and rose topower in the party as Hitler’s architect. In that role he created buildings thatsymbolized the Reich and represented its ideas and quickly became a favorite,joining Hitler’s inner circle. In February 1942 Hitler made Speer his ministerof armaments and war production after the former minister, Fritz Todt, died in aplane crash. By the following month Speer had persuaded Hitler to make all otherelements of the German economy second to armaments production, which Hitler didby decree. “Total productivity in armaments [endnotes.xhtml#en0030] increased by59.6 per cent,” Speer claimed after the war. At the age of thirty-seven, AlbertSpeer was now responsible [endnotes.xhtml#en0029] for all science and technologyprograms [endnotes.xhtml#en0031] necessary for waging war. Of the hundreds ofweapons projects he was involved in, it was the V-2 that he favored most.Like von Braun, Speer was from a wealthy, well-respected German family, notquite a baron but someone who wished he was. Speer liked to exchange ideas withyouthful, ambitious rocket scientists like Wernher von Braun. He admired “youngmen able to work unhampered by bureaucratic obstacles and pursue ideas which attimes sounded thoroughly utopian [endnotes.xhtml#en0032].”As for General Dornberger, the Castle Varlar celebration was a crowning momentof his career. The pomp and power thrilled him, he later recalled. “It was ascene,” Dornberger said after the war—the excitement of the evening[endnotes.xhtml#en0033], “[t]he blackness of the night.…” At one point duringthe meal, in between courses, the lights inside the castle were turned off andthe grand banquet hall was plunged into darkness. After a moment of anticipatorysilence, a tall curtain at the end of the long hall swung open, allowing gueststo gaze out across the dark, wintry lawns. “The room suddenly lit [up] with theflickering light of the rocket’s exhaust and [was] shaken by the reverberationsof its engines,” remembered Dornberger. Outside, perched atop a mobilerocket-launch pad, the spectacle began. An inferno of burning rocket fuelblasted out the bottom of the V-2, powering the massive rocket into flight,headed toward Belgium. For Dornberger, rocket launches instilled “unbelievable”feelings of pride. Once, during an earlier launch, the general wept with joy.On this night the excitement focus alternated—from a rocket launch to awarddecoration, then back to a rocket launch again. After each launch, Speerdecorated one of the medal recipients. The crowd clapped and cheered and sippedchampagne until the banquet hall was again filled with darkness and the nextrocket fired off the castle lawn.This particular party would end, but the celebrations continued elsewhere. Theteam returned to Peenemünde, the isolated island facility on the Baltic Coastwhere the V-weapons had been conceived and originally produced, and on the nightof December 16, 1944, a party in the Peenemünde’s officer’s club again honoredthe men. Von Braun and Dornberger, wearing crisp tuxedos, each with a Knight’sCross from Hitler dangling around his neck, read telegrams of congratulations toNazi officials as the group toasted their success with flutes of champagne[endnotes.xhtml#en0034]. In the eyes of the Reich, Hitler’s rocketeers had goodreason to celebrate. In Antwerp at 3:20 p.m., a V-2 rocket had smashed into theRex Cinema, where almost 1,200 people were watching a Gary Cooper film. It wasthe highest death toll [endnotes.xhtml#en0035] from a single rocket attackduring the war—567 casualties.The Allies were obsessed with the Nazis’ V-weapons. If they had been readyearlier, the course of war would have been different, explained General DwightD. Eisenhower, Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. “It seemed likely that[endnotes.xhtml#en0036], if the German had succeeded in perfecting and usingthese new weapons six months earlier than he did, our invasion of Europe wouldhave proved exceedingly difficult, perhaps impossible,” Eisenhower said.Instead, circumstance worked in the Allies’ favor, and by the fall of 1944,Allied forces had a firm foothold on the European continent. But back inWashington, D.C., inside the Pentagon, a secret, U.S.-only rocket-relatedscientific intelligence mission was in the works. Colonel Gervais WilliamTrichel was the first chief of the newly created Rocket Branch inside U.S. ArmyOrdnance. Now Trichel was putting together [endnotes.xhtml#en0037] a group ofarmy scientists to send to Europe as part of Special Mission V-2. The UnitedStates was twenty years behind Germany in rocket development, but Trichel saw anopportunity to close that gap and save the U.S. Army millions of dollars inresearch and development costs. Trichel’s team would capture these rockets andeverything related to them for shipment back to the United States. The missionwould begin as soon as the U.S. Army arrived in the town of Nordhausen, Germany.The British had the lead [endnotes.xhtml#en0038] on intelligence regardingV-weapons. Their photo interpreters had determined exactly where the rocketswere being assembled, at a factory in central Germany in the naturally fortifiedHarz Mountains. Trying to bomb this factory from the air was useless, becausethe facility had been built underground in an old gypsum mine. While theAmericans made plans inside the Pentagon, and while von Braun and his colleaguesdrank champagne at Peenemünde, the men actually assembling the Reich’s V-2rockets endured an entirely different existence. Nazi science had brought backthe institution of slavery all across the Reich, and concentration campprisoners were being worked to death in the service of war. The workers buildingrockets included thousands of grotesquely malnourished prisoners who toiled awayinside a sprawling underground tunnel complex known by its euphemism,Mittelwerk, the Middle Works [endnotes.xhtml#en0039]. This place was also calledNordhausen, after the town, and Dora, the code name for its concentration camp.To average Germans the Harz was a land of fairy tales, of dark forests andstormy mountains. To those who read Goethe, here was the place where the witchesand the devil collided at Brocken Mountain. Even in America, in Disney’s popularfilm Fantasia, these mountains had meaning. They were where forces of evilgathered to do their handiwork. But at the end of the Second World War, theReich’s secret, subterranean penal colony at Nordhausen was fact, not fiction.The Mittelwerk was a place where ordinary citizens—of France, Holland, Belgium,Italy, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Russia, Poland, and Germany—had beentransformed into the Third Reich’s slaves.The underground factory at Nordhausen had been in operation since late August1943, after a Royal Air Force attack on the Peenemünde facility up north forcedarmaments production to move elsewhere. The day after that attack, HeinrichHimmler, Reichsführer-SS, paid a visit to Hitler and proposed they move rocketproduction underground [endnotes.xhtml#en0040]. Hitler agreed, and the SS wasput in charge of supplying slaves and overseeing facilities construction. Theindividual in charge of expanding Nordhausen from a mine to a tunnel complex wasBrigadier General Hans Kammler [endnotes.xhtml#en0041], a civil engineer andarchitect who, earlier in his career, built the gas chambers atAuschwitz-Birkenau.The first group of 107 slave laborers arrived at the Mittelwerk in late August1943. They came from the Buchenwald concentration camp, located fifty miles tothe southeast. The wrought-iron sign over the Buchenwald gate read Jedem dasSeine, [endnotes.xhtml#en0042] “Everyone gets what he deserves.” Digging tunnelswas hard labor, but the SS feared prisoners might revolt if they had miningtools, so the men dug with their bare hands. The old mine had been used by theGerman army as a fuel storage facility. There were two long tunnels runningparallel into the mountain that needed to be widened now for railcars. Therewere also smaller cross-tunnels every few meters that needed to be lengthened tocreate more workspace. In September 1943 machinery and personnel arrived fromPeenemünde. Notable among the staff, and important to Operation Paperclip, wasthe man in charge of production, a high school graduate [endnotes.xhtml#en0043]named Arthur Rudolph.Rudolph’s specialty was rocket engine assembly. He had worked under von Braun inthis capacity since 1934. Rudolph was a Nazi ideologue; he joined the partybefore there was any national pressure to do so, in 1931. What he lacked inacademic pedigree he made up for as a slave driver. As the Mittelwerk operationsdirector, Rudolph worked with the SS construction staff [endnotes.xhtml#en0044]to build the underground factory. Then he oversaw production on the assemblylines for V-weapons scientific director Wernher von Braun.The prisoners worked [endnotes.xhtml#en0045] twelve-hour shifts, seven days aweek, putting together V-weapons. By the end of the first two months there wereeight thousand men living and working in this cramped underground space. Therewas no fresh air in the tunnels, no ventilation system, no water, and verylittle light. “Blasting went on day and night and the dust after every blast wasso thick that it was impossible to see five steps ahead,” read one report[endnotes.xhtml#en0046]. Laborers slept inside the tunnels on wood bunk beds.There were no washing facilities and no sanitation. Latrines were barrels cut inhalf. The workers suffered and died [endnotes.xhtml#en0047] from starvation,dysentery, pleurisy, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and phlegmasia from beatings. Themen were walking skeletons, skin stretched over bones. Some perished fromammonia burns to the lungs. Others died by being crushed from the weight of therocket parts they were forced to carry. The dead were replaceable[endnotes.xhtml#en0048]. Humans and machine parts went into the tunnels. Rocketsand corpses came out. Workers who were slow on the production lines were beatento death. Insubordinates were garroted or hanged. After the war, war crimesinvestigators determined that approximately half of the sixty thousand[endnotes.xhtml#en0049] men eventually brought to Nordhausen were worked todeath.The Mittelwerk wasn’t the first slave labor camp created and run by the ThirdReich. The SS recognized the value of slave labor in the mid-1930s. Humans couldbe selected from the ever-growing prisoner populations at concentration campsand put to work in quarries and factories. By 1939 the SS had masterminded avast network of state-sponsored slavery across Nazi-occupied Europe through aninnocuous-sounding division [endnotes.xhtml#en0050] called the SS BusinessAdministration Main Office. This office was overseen by Heinrich Himmler[endnotes.xhtml#en0051] but required partnerships [endnotes.xhtml#en0052]. Theseincluded many companies from the private sector, including IG Farben,Volkswagen, Heinkel, and Steyr-Daimler-Puch. The most significant partner wasAlbert Speer’s Ministry of Armaments and War Production. When Speer took over asarmaments minister in February 1942 his first challenge, he said, was to figureout how to galvanize war production and make it more efficient. Speer’s solutionwas to get rid of bureaucracy and use more slave laborers. He himself had beenconnected to the slave labor programs with the SS for years, including when hewas an architect. Speer’s buildings [endnotes.xhtml#en0053] required vastamounts of stone, which was quarried by concentration camp laborers fromMauthausen and Flossenbürg.The SS Business Administration Main Office specialized in engineering dangerousand fast construction projects, as was the case with the V-2 facility atNordhausen. “Pay no attention to the human victims,” Brigadier General HansKammler told his staff overseeing construction in the tunnels. “The work mustproceed [endnotes.xhtml#en0054] and be finished in the shortest possible time.”In the first six months [endnotes.xhtml#en0055] of tunnel work, 2,882 laborersdied. Albert Speer praised Kammler for what he considered to be a greatachievement in engineering, setting things up so efficiently and so fast. “[Yourwork] far exceeds anything ever done in Europe and is unsurpassed even byAmerican standards, [endnotes.xhtml#en0056]” wrote Speer.There were other reasons why the use of slave labor was so important to wonderweapons production, namely, the secrecy it ensured. The V-2 was a classifiedweapons project; the less Allied intelligence knew about it, the better for theReich. When Albert Speer and Heinrich Himmler met with Hitler in August of 1943to brief him on the benefits of using slave labor, Himmler reminded the Führer[endnotes.xhtml#en0057] that if the Reich’s entire workforce were to beconcentration camp prisoners, “all contact with the outside world would beeliminated. Prisoners don’t even receive mail.”In the spring of 1944, V-2 production had accelerated to the point where the SSprovided Mittelwerk managers with their own concentration camp, Dora, which inturn grew to include thirty subcamps [endnotes.xhtml#en0058]. The man in chargeof “personnel” at the Mittelwerk, its general manager, was a forty-six-year-oldengineer named Georg Rickhey, an ardent Nazi and party member since 1931. OnRickhey’s résumé, later used by the Americans to employ him, Rickhey describedhimself as “Mittelwerk General Manager [endnotes.xhtml#en0059], production ofall ‘V’ and rocket weapons, construction of underground mass-productionfacilities, director of entire concern.” As general manager of the sprawling,subterranean enterprise, Rickhey was in charge [endnotes.xhtml#en0060] of“renting” slaves from the SS. As a former Demag Armor Works executive, he hadalready overseen the creation of more than 1.5 million square feet ofunderground tunnels around Berlin, all dug by slaves. With this experienceRickhey had become a veteran negotiator between private industry and the SSBusiness Administration Main Office in the procurement of slaves. “The SS began,in effect, a rent-a-slave service to firms and government enterprises at atypical rate of four marks [endnotes.xhtml#en0061] a day for unskilled workersand six marks for skilled ones,” writes V-weapon historian Michael J. Neufeld.The slaves were disposable. When they died they were replaced. At Nordhausen theSS gave Rickhey a discount, charging the Mittelwerk between two and threereichsmarks per man [endnotes.xhtml#en0062], per day.On May 6, 1944, days after becoming general manager of the Mittelwerk, Rickheycalled a meeting to discuss how best to acquire more prisoners for slave labor.Wernher von Braun, Walter Dornberger, and Arthur Rudolph were all present[endnotes.xhtml#en0063]. It was decided that the SS should enslave anothereighteen hundred skilled French workers to fill the shoes of those who hadalready been worked to death. The record indicates that von Braun, Dornberger,and Rudolph showed no objection to Rickhey’s plan.In August, the same problem was again at issue. This time Wernher von Brauninitiated the action himself. On August 15, 1944, von Braun wrote a letter to aMittelwerk engineer, Albin Sawatzki, describing a new laboratory he wanted toset up inside the tunnels. Von Braun told Sawatzki that to expedite the process,he had taken it upon himself to procure the slave laborers from the Buchenwaldconcentration camp.“During my last visit to the Mittelwerk [endnotes.xhtml#en0064], you proposed tome that we use the good technical education of detainees available to you [from]Buchenwald,” wrote von Braun. “I immediately looked into your proposal by goingto Buchenwald [myself], together with Dr. Simon [a colleague], to seek out morequalified detainees. I have arranged their transfer to the Mittelwerk withStandartenführer [Colonel] Pister,” the commandant of Buchenwald.In December of 1944, with slave laborers dying by the thousands in theMittelwerk tunnels and V-2 rockets crashing into civilian population centers,causing mayhem and terror across Europe, it would have been hard to imagine thatsome of those directly responsible would ever be regarded as individuals ofgreat value to the United States. And yet in less than a year Arthur Rudolph,Georg Rickhey, Wernher von Braun, Major General Walter Dornberger, and otherrocket engineers would secretly be heading to America to work. In the last daysof World War II few would ever have believed such a thing.But the war’s last days were coming. Just three weeks after the celebration atCastle Varlar, Albert Speer found himself with a lot less to celebrate. Visitingthe Belgian border town of Houffalize, accompanied by an SS armored forcecommander named Josef “Sepp” Dietrich, Speer had what he would describe in his1969 memoir as a realization. Gazing upon the bodies of hundreds of dead Germansoldiers killed in a recent Allied bomber attack, Speer decided the war was overfor the Reich. The German war machine could no longer compete against the forceand will of the Allied offensive. “Howling and exploding bombs[endnotes.xhtml#en0065], clouds illuminated in red and yellow hues, droningmotors, and no defense anywhere—I was stunned by this scene of militaryimpotence which Hitler’s military miscalculations had given such a grotesquesetting,” Speer wrote. Standing there in Houffalize, Speer—Hitler’s minister ofarmaments and war production—decided to flee from the danger zone.At 4:00 a.m. on the morning of December 31, under cover of darkness, Speer andan aide climbed into a private car and hurried east, headed for the comforts ofa sprawling mountaintop castle outside Frankfurt called Schloss Kransberg, orCastle Kransberg. Built on a steep, rocky cliff in the Taunus Mountains, thecastle was one of Hermann Göring’s Luftwaffe (German air force) headquarters.Just as many of Hitler’s scientists would soon become American scientists, sowould many of the Reich’s headquarters and command posts become key facilitiesused for Operation Paperclip. Castle Kransberg also had a storied past in thehistory of warfare. The structure dated from the eleventh century, but itsoriginal foundation had been built on top of the ruins of a ring-wallfortification constructed in the time of the Roman Empire. Battles had beenwaged in this region, on and off, for over two thousand years.Castle Kransberg was grand and splendid, built piecemeal over the centuries toinclude watchtowers, half-timbered meeting halls, and stone walls. It had150-odd rooms, including a wing that had been redesigned and renovated by AlbertSpeer in 1939, when Speer was still Hitler’s architect. At Hitler’s behest Speeradded several state-of-the art defense features to Kransberg Castle, including atwelve-hundred-square-foot underground bunker complex, complete with poison gasair locks [endnotes.xhtml#en0066] designed to protect inhabitants from achemical warfare attack. Now here was Speer, having fled from the front lines tohide out in this citadel. The next time he would live here it would be as aprisoner of the Americans.Hitler had his own headquarters just a few miles away. Adlerhorst, or theEagle’s Nest, had also been designed by Speer. It was a series of small cementbunkers [endnotes.xhtml#en0067] at the edge of a long stretch of valley near thespa town of Bad Nauheim. Few knew it was there. From Adlerhorst, Hitler had beendirecting [endnotes.xhtml#en0068] the Ardennes campaign—the Battle of the Bulge.Arriving at Kransberg Castle late at night after fleeing Houffalize, Speer andhis aide were shown to their quarters, where they freshened up before drivingover to Adlerhorst to celebrate the coming year—1945—with Hitler. When Speerarrived at the Eagle’s Nest at 2:30 a.m. on January 1, Hitler, who never drank,appeared drunk. “He was in the grip of a permanent euphoria,” remembered Speer.Hitler made a toast and promised that the present low point in the war wouldsoon be overcome. “His [Hitler’s] magnetic gifts were still operative,” Speerlater recalled [endnotes.xhtml#en0069]. In the end Germany would be victorious,Hitler said. This was enough for Speer to change his mind about losing the war.Two weeks later, on January 15, with the war allegedly still winnable, AdolfHitler boarded his armored train and began the nineteen-hour trip to Berlin,where he would spend the rest of his life living underground in the Führerbunker(Führerhauptquartier, or FHQ) in Berlin. The bunker was a fortress ofengineering prowess, built beneath the New Reich Chancellery. Its roof, buriedunder several tons of earth, was sixteen feet thick. Its walls were six feetwide. Living inside the Führerbunker, with its low ceilings and cryptlikecorridors, was “like being stranded in a cement submarine,” said one of Hitler’sSS honor guards, Captain Beermann. Beermann described a “bat-like routine ofpart-time prisoners kept in a cave. Miserable rats in a musty cement tomb inBerlin.” Not everyone shared the sentiment. Months later, when Mittelwerkgeneral manager Georg Rickhey was angling to get a job from the Americans, hewould boast to army officers that he’d overseen construction of the grandFührerbunker in Berlin [endnotes.xhtml#en0070].Now, in mid-January 1945, with Hitler moving back [endnotes.xhtml#en0071] toBerlin, it was decided that Speer should head east, to Silesia, in Poland.There, he was to survey what was going on. Important chemical weapons factorieshad been built in Poland, armaments ventures jointly pursued with IG Farben, achemical industry conglomerate. The location of these facilities wassignificant; Poland was, for the most part, out of reach of Allied bombingcampaigns. But a new threat was bearing down. The Soviets had just launchedtheir great offensive in Poland, a final military campaign that would take theRed Army all the way to Berlin. Germany was being invaded from both sides—eastand west—squeezed as in a vise.The same day that Hitler left the Eagle’s Nest, Speer was driven to Poland.There, he witnessed firsthand what little was left of the Reich’s war machine.On January 21, he went to the village of Oppeln to check in with Field MarshalFerdinand Schörner, newly appointed commander of the army group, and learnedthat very little of the Wehrmacht’s fighting forces remained intact. Nearlyevery soldier and every war machine had been captured or destroyed[endnotes.xhtml#en0072]. Burnt-out tank hulls littered the snow-covered roads.Thousands of dead German soldiers lay in ditches along the roadsides, but manymore dead soldiers swung eerily from trees. Those who dared desert the Germanarmy had been killed by Field Marshal Schörner, a ferocious and fanatical NaziParty loyalist [endnotes.xhtml#en0073] who had earned his moniker, Schörner theBloody. The dead German soldiers had placards hanging around their necks. “I ama deserter [endnotes.xhtml#en0074],” they read. “I have declined to defendGerman women and children and therefore I have been hanged.”During Speer’s meeting with Schörner, he was told that no one had any idea[endnotes.xhtml#en0075] exactly how far the Red Army was from overtaking thevery spot where they were standing, only that the onslaught was inevitable.Speer checked into an otherwise empty hotel [endnotes.xhtml#en0076] and tried tosleep.For decades, this night remained vivid in Albert Speer’s mind. “In my room hungan etching [endnotes.xhtml#en0077] by Käthe Kollwitz: La Carmagnole,” rememberedSpeer as an old man. “It showed a yowling mob dancing with hate-contorted facesaround a guillotine. Off to one side a weeping woman cowered on the ground.… Theweird figures of the etching haunted my fitful sleep,” wrote Speer. There, inhis Oppeln hotel room, Albert Speer was overcome by a thought that had to havebeen preoccupying many Nazis’ minds. After Germany, what will become of me? Theguillotine? Will I be torn apart by a yowling mob?Jedem das Seine. Could it be true? Does everyone get what he deserves?The following week, on January 30, 1945, Speer wrote a memorandum to Hitleroutlining the huge losses in Silesia. “The war is lost [endnotes.xhtml#en0078],”is how Speer’s report began.Widespread destruction of evidence would now begin."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter002]DESTRUCTION [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter002]Ninety miles southeast of Speer’s Oppeln hotel room, chaos was unfolding at theAuschwitz-Birkenau death camp. Speer’s chairman of the ultra-secret Committee-Cfor chemical weapons, a chemist named Dr. Otto Ambros, had documents to destroy.It was January 17, 1945, and every German in a position of power at Auschwitz,from the army officers to the IG Farben officials, was trying to flee. NotAmbros. He would not leave the labor-extermination camp for another six days.Otto Ambros was a fastidious man. His calculations were exact, his wordscarefully chosen, his fingernails always manicured. He wore his hair neatlyoiled and parted. In addition to being Hitler’s favorite chemist, Ambros was themanager of IG Farben’s synthetic rubber and fuel factory at Auschwitz. With theRed Army bearing down, the Farben board members had ordered the destruction andremoval of all classified paperwork; Ambros and colleague Walther Dürrfeld wereat Auschwitz to do the job. In addition to being the plant manager of thishellish place, Ambros was the youngest member on Farben’s board of directors.All over the camp, SS guards were destroying evidence. Crematoria II and IIIwere being dismantled, and a plan to dynamite Crematoria V was in effect. Someof the SS officers were already fleeing on horseback, while others werepreparing to evacuate prisoners for the death march. Whips cracked. Dogs barked.Tanks painted white for camouflage outside the camp rolled through the muddystreets. Rumors swirled: The Red Army was only a few miles away. A femalechemist in Farben’s Buna-Werke Polymerization Department asked the prisoner andfuture world-renowned writer Primo Levi, a chemist by training, to fix herbicycle tire. After the war, Levi recalled [endnotes.xhtml#en0079] how strangeit was to hear a Farben employee use the word “please” with a Jewish inmate likehimself.Auschwitz was the Reich’s largest extermination center. As a concentration campit consisted of three separate but symbiotic camps: Auschwitz I, the main camp;Auschwitz II, the Birkenau gas chambers and crematoria; and Auschwitz III[endnotes.xhtml#en0080], a labor-concentration camp run by the chemical giant IGFarben. Since April 7, 1942, IG Farben had been building the Reich’s largestchemical plant at Auschwitz, using a workforce of slave laborers selected fromthe Auschwitz train car platforms. Farben called their facility “IG Auschwitz.”IG Auschwitz was the first corporate concentration camp [endnotes.xhtml#en0081]in the Third Reich. The barracks in which the slave laborers lived and died wasofficially called Monowitz. “Those of us who lived there called it Buna,”recalls Gerhard Maschkowski, a survivor of the camp. Maschkowski was anineteen-year-old Jewish boy spared the gas chamber because he was of use to IGAuschwitz as an electrician. That he was still alive in the second week ofJanuary 1945 was something of a miracle. He had arrived at Auschwitz on April20, 1943, which meant that he had been there for a year and nine months. AtBuna, the average lifespan of a slave laborer was three months. Many of GerhardMaschkowski’s friends had long since been worked to death or had been murderedfor minor infractions [endnotes.xhtml#en0082], like hiding a piece of food.Gerhard Maschkowski remembers January 18, 1945, with clarity, because it was hislast day at Auschwitz. It was still dark outside when the SS burst into thebarracks. “They shouted, ‘Get up! March!’ They had large guns, thick jackets,and dogs,” Maschkowski recalls. He put on his shoes and hurried outside. There,nine thousand emaciated, starving inmates [endnotes.xhtml#en0083] from Buna werelining up in neat rows. Maschkowski heard cannon fire in the distance and thecrack of firearms close by. There was chaos all around. SS guards were burningevidence. Bonfires of papers sent ashes up into the dark sky. Snow fell fast,then faster. There was a blizzard on the way. The guards, dressed in warm coatsand boots, waved submachine guns. “Dogs on leather leashes[endnotes.xhtml#en0084] barked and snarled,” Gerhard Maschkowski recalls.Wearing thin pajamas, the prisoners at Buna-Monowitz began a death march towardthe German interior. Within forty-eight hours, 60 percent of them would be dead.Primo Levi was not part of the death march. A week before, he had contractedscarlet fever and had been sent to the infectious diseases ward[endnotes.xhtml#en0085]. “He had a high temperature [endnotes.xhtml#en0086] anda strawberry tongue,” remembered Aldo Moscati, the Italian doctor-prisoner whotended to him. “With a [104-degree] fever I was extremely feeble and could noteven walk,” Primo Levi explained [endnotes.xhtml#en0087] after the war. Lyingsupine in the infectious diseases ward, he listened to the sounds of theemptying camp.On January 21, a memorandum from Berlin ordered all Farben employees to leave.The last train for Germans leaving Auschwitz, transporting mostly IG Farben’sfemale staff from the camp, left that same afternoon. Yet Otto Ambros stayedbehind. Ambros’s official title was plant manager of Buna-Werk IV[endnotes.xhtml#en0088] and managing director of the fuel production facility atIG Auschwitz. He had been involved in the facility since January 1941, back whenFarben’s original plans were being drawn. Ambros had chosen the site locationand sketched out the original blueprints for the plant. He was also the man whoinvented synthetic rubber for the Reich. Tanks, trucks, and airplanes allrequire rubber for tires and treads, and during wartime this feat was consideredso important to the Reich’s ability to wage war that Ambros had been awarded[endnotes.xhtml#en0089] 1 million reichsmarks by the Führer.Finally, on January 23, 1945, Ambros left the concentration camp[endnotes.xhtml#en0090]. Only random prisoners remained. Inmates like Primo Leviwho were too weak to march and had not been killed by the SS lay in theinfectious diseases ward. When Levi’s fever finally broke and he venturedoutside, he found groups of prisoners roaming around the camp looking for food.Levi found a silo filled with frozen potatoes. He made a fire and cooked hisfirst food in days. On January 27, he was dragging a dead friend’s corpse to alarge grave dug in a distant field when he spotted four men on horsebackapproaching the camp from far away. They were wearing white camouflage clothing,but as they got closer he could see that at the center of the soldiers’ capsthere was a bright red star. The Red Army had arrived. Auschwitz was liberated.Otto Ambros was already on the way to Falkenhagen, Germany, to destroy evidence[endnotes.xhtml#en0091] in another Farben factory there. Speer headed back toBerlin. Neither man dared travel north inside Poland, where a second armamentsfactory the two men were jointly involved in was also in jeopardy of beingcaptured by the Soviets. At this facility, called Dyhernfurth after the smallriverside village in which it was located, IG Farben produced chemicalweapons—deadly nerve agents—on an industrial scale. On January 24, 1945, the dayafter Ambros fled Auschwitz, Farben had given the word to evacuate Dyhernfurth[endnotes.xhtml#en0092] and destroy whatever evidence remained there. Allmunitions were loaded onto railcars and trucks and sent to depots in the west.The destruction of evidence was now becoming standard operating procedure atlaboratories, research facilities, and armaments factories across the Reich. Andwhile Nazi Germany faced imminent collapse, its scientists, engineers, andbusinessmen had their futures to think about.All across Nazi-occupied Poland, German forces were retreating en masse as theRed Army continued to shred the eastern front. On February 5, 1945, one hundredand seventy miles northwest of Auschwitz, the Soviets captured the village ofDyhernfurth. Soviet soldiers took over the town’s castle, built during theseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and drank up its wine cellar. The castle,with its fairy-tale-like conical spires, quickly transformed into a scene ofwild debauchery, with inebriated Russian soldiers singing rowdy victory songs.The situation got so out of control that Russian commanders suspended fightinguntil order could be restored. This made for a perfect opportunity for a team ofNazi commandos hiding in the forest to launch a daring and unprecedented raid.Less than half a mile away, one of the Reich’s most prized wonder weaponsfacilities lay hidden underground. Camouflaged in a forest of pine trees, insidea large complex of underground bombproof bunkers, a workforce of 560white-collar Germans and 3,000 slave laborers had been mass-producing, since1942, liquid tabun—a deadly nerve agent the very existence of which was unknownto the outside world.Tabun was one of Hitler’s most jealously guarded secrets, a true wonder weaponof the most diabolical kind. Similar to a pesticide, the organophosphate tabunwas one of the most deadly substances in the world. A tiny drop to the skincould kill an individual in minutes [endnotes.xhtml#en0093] or sometimesseconds. Exposure meant [endnotes.xhtml#en0094] the glands and muscles wouldhyperstimulate and the respiratory system would fail. Paralysis would set in andbreathing would cease. At Dyhernfurth, where accidents had happened[endnotes.xhtml#en0095], a human’s death by tabun gas resembled the freneticlast moments of an ant [endnotes.xhtml#en0096] sprayed with insecticide.Like the synthetic rubber and fuel factory at Auschwitz, the nerve agentproduction facility at Dyhernfurth was owned and operated by IG Farben, and herethe Speer ministry worked with Farben to fill aerial bombs with tabun that couldeventually be deployed from Luftwaffe planes. No one in the inner circle knewfor sure when, or if, Hitler would finally concede to many of his ministers’wishes and allow for a chemical weapons attack against the Allies. But asevidenced at Dyhernfurth, the opportunity was real. Enough poison gas had beenproduced here to decimate the population of London or Paris on any given day.Despite the overwhelming onslaught of Red Army troops to this region in Februaryof 1945, Hitler remained determined to keep the secrets of tabun out of enemyhands. On the morning of February 5, 1945, Major General Max Sachsenheimer ofthe Reich’s Seventeenth Field Replacement Battalion and his troops were hidingin the forest along the banks of the Oder River. Sachsenheimer’s commando force[endnotes.xhtml#en0097] was made up of several hundred soldiers, but he also hada unique secondary contingent of men, namely, eighty-two scientists andtechnicians. Some were army scientists but most were IG Farben employees andchemical weapons experts. Sachsenheimer’s mission was to protect the scientistswhile they scrubbed Farben’s facility of any and all traces of tabun.The Dyhernfurth complex was a sprawling, state-of-the-art production plant.Speer’s Armaments and War Production Ministry had paid Farben nearly 200 millionreichsmarks to build and operate it. The facility had been secretly andskillfully designed and managed by Otto Ambros. As he had done with IGAuschwitz, Ambros had overseen every element of this chemical weapons factorydating from the winter of 1941, when the thick forest here was first cleared ofpine trees [endnotes.xhtml#en0098] by 120 concentration camp slaves.As Nazi Germany blended industry, war making, and genocide, few corporationswere as central a player as IG Farben. The chemical concern was the largestcorporation in Europe [endnotes.xhtml#en0099] and the fourth largest corporationin the world. IG Farben owned the patent on Zyklon B. And perhaps no singleperson at Farben was as central a figure in this equation as Otto Ambros hadbeen. For his work as chairman of Committee-C [endnotes.xhtml#en0100], thechemical weapons committee inside the Speer Ministry, Ambros was given theprestigious title [endnotes.xhtml#en0101] of military economy leader(Wehrwirtschaftsführer). He was awarded the War Merit Cross, 1st and 2nd Class,and the Knight’s Cross of the War Merit Cross, which was similar to the awardbestowed on Dornberger and von Braun.There was a second scientist who played an important role in chemical weapons—aman who, like Otto Ambros, would be targeted for Operation Paperclip. This wasSS-Brigadeführer Dr. Walter Schieber, a chemist by training, Speer’s deputy anddirector of the Armaments Supply Office. Schieber was a hard-core Nazi ideologueand a member of Reichsführer-SS Himmler’s personal staff. Unusually corpulentfor an SS officer, his official car and airplane required retrofitting[endnotes.xhtml#en0102] to accommodate his 275-pound frame. With Hitler’sphysician, Karl Brandt, Schieber was in charge of gas mask production, arequisite for troop defense if chemical warfare was to be waged. As withbiological weapons, the sword needs a shield, and by January of 1945 Schieberhad overseen the production of 46.1 million gas masks. Their reliability[endnotes.xhtml#en0103] had been tested at Dyhernfurth on concentration campprisoners. The stories that would emerge during the Nuremberg trials about suchtests were ghoulish, including locking prisoners in glass rooms and sprayingthem with nerve agent. War crimes investigators would later debate whether ornot these actions were pilot programs for the gas chambers. The full story ofhow, and to what extent, Dr. Walter Schieber [endnotes.xhtml#en0104] worked forthe U.S. military after the war—and also for the CIA—has never been fullyexplained until this book.Only weeks before the Red Army took Dyhernfurth, overran its castle, and drankall its wine, thousands of concentration camp slave laborers had been toilingaway at Farben’s secret chemical weapons plant performing the deadliest of jobs.Wearing double-layer rubber suits and bubble-shaped helmets, prisoners filledartillery shells and bomb casings with nerve agent, marking each munition in asecret code indicating tabun nerve agent: three green rings of paint. Theprisoners’ suits worked similar to deep-sea diving suits[endnotes.xhtml#en0105]. Attached to the back of each helmet was a tubedelivering breathable air. But the air tube was short and gave workers verylittle room to move. If a man accidentally detached from the air source, hewould be exposed to the lethal vapors through the breathing tube and die.But on the morning of February 5, 1945, the facility was empty. Not a chemist ora slave laborer remained. The munitions had been moved, documentary evidencedestroyed, and all the IG Farben employees had fled. The prisoners had beenevacuated by their SS guards three weeks before. Wearing prisoner pajamas andill-fitting wooden work shoes, the Dyhernfurth laborers were marched west towardthe German interior. Witnesses in nearby villages [endnotes.xhtml#en0106]described a column of three thousand walking corpses. Temperatures in the areareached -18 degrees Fahrenheit. By the time the prisoners reached theGross-Rosen concentration camp, fifty miles to the southwest, two-thirds of themhad died of exposure.Now, working on Hitler’s orders, a technical team was preparing to return toFarben’s secret facility for a final scrub of tabun residue. In the freezingpredawn air, the two chemists, eighty technicians, and a group of Germancommandos donned double-layered rubber suits, pulled gas masks over their heads,and stole down the banks of the Oder River. They moved quietly across apartially bombed-out railroad bridge, walked slowly down the railroad tracks,and headed to the chemical weapons plant. The protective suits were cumbersome,and it took the technical team sixty-five minutes to travel less than a half amile. Reaching the plant, the group made its way into the production facilitythat housed massive silver-lined kettles in which the nerve agent was made. Eachkettle sat inside an operating chamber enclosed in double-glass walls encirclinga complex ventilation system of double-walled pipes. While one group got to workdecontaminating the chambers with ammonia and steam, another group scoured thesurfaces of the munitions-filling factory where so many slave laborers had metdeath. The commandos kept guard.While the technicians scrubbed, two and a half miles downriver Major GeneralSachsenheimer’s remaining platoon of soldiers sprang into action. They launchedartillery shells at sleeping Russian forces in a diversionary feint. The RedArmy reorganized and retaliated, and by lunchtime eighteen Soviet tanks wereengaged in fierce fighting with Sachsenheimer’s troops. The battle, a footnotein the annals of the war, lasted just long enough for IG Farben’s technical teamto get in, get out, and disappear.Not for several days did the Red Army finally stumble upon Farben’s chemicalweapons facility at Dyhernfurth. By then it was void of people and tabun[endnotes.xhtml#en0107] but otherwise entirely intact. As the Russians examinedthe facility, scrubbed immaculately clean, it became clear to the commandersthat whatever this facility had produced must have been considered of greatvalue to the Reich. The laboratory layout bore signs of chemical weaponsproduction, and the Soviet army called in their own chemical weapons expertsfrom the Sixteenth and Eighteenth Chemical Brigades [endnotes.xhtml#en0108]. Thefactory was dismantled [endnotes.xhtml#en0109], crated, and shipped back to theSoviet Union for future use. What had been produced here in the forest remaineda mystery to its new owners—the Russians—for a little over a year. By 1946 theentire chemical weapons factory at Dyhernfurth would be reassembled in a littletown outside Stalingrad called Beketovka, and the plant given the Russian codename, Chemical Works No. 91 [endnotes.xhtml#en0110]. The Soviets themselves thenbegan producing tabun nerve agent on an industrial scale. By 1948, the SovietMilitary Chemical Text Book would list tabun as part of the Red Army’s stockpile[endnotes.xhtml#en0111]. But 1948 was so far away. So much would happen withAmerica and Hitler’s chemists between 1945 and 1948, most of it predicated onthe emerging Soviet threat.Back in Berlin, Hitler read the first page of Speer’s report and ordered itfiled away. Then Hitler became enraged. His furor was likely exacerbated by aconference taking place on the Crimea Peninsula, at Yalta, beginning February 4,1945. It was to last for eight days. There, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalinwere confirming their commitment to demand Germany’s unconditional surrender.There would be no bargaining, the three heads of state declared. No deals madewith the Nazis. The end of the war would mean the end of the Third Reich. Warcriminals would be tried, justice meted out.The idea of what defined justice varied dramatically from power to power.British Prime Minister Winston Churchill wanted Nazis leaders to be treated as“outlaws.” He argued that they should be lined up and shot rather than put ontrial. The premier of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, rather unexpectedlyargued [endnotes.xhtml#en0112] for “no executions without trial.” PresidentFranklin D. Roosevelt wanted a war crimes trial. What all parties agreed on wasthat, after the surrender, Germany would be broken up into three zones ofoccupation. (Soon, France’s involvement would make it four.) When Hitler learnedof the Allies’ plan to divvy up the spoils of Germany, he became furious. Thenhe called on Albert Speer.“If the war is lost, [endnotes.xhtml#en0113]” Hitler famously told Speer, “thenation will also perish. This fate is inevitable.” If Germany loses the war,Hitler said, the people deserved existential punishment for being weak. “Whatwill remain [endnotes.xhtml#en0114] after this struggle will be in any case onlythe inferior ones, since the good ones have fallen,” Hitler said. Following thislogic, Hitler decreed that Speer’s ministry need not provide German citizenswith even the most basic necessities, including shelter and food. He told Speer[endnotes.xhtml#en0115] that if Speer were ever to give him another memorandumsaying the war was unwinnable, and that negotiations with the enemy should beconsidered, Hitler would consider this an act of treason punishable by death.Hitler then issued a nationwide “scorched-earth” policy. Speer was to helporganize the complete destruction of all German infrastructure, military andcivilian—from its transportation and communication systems to its bridges anddams. Officially entitled Demolitions on Reich Territory[endnotes.xhtml#en0116], this order became known as the Nero Decree, orNerobefehl, invoking the Roman emperor Nero, who allegedly engineered the GreatFire of 64 AD and then watched Rome burn.In central Germany, in the naturally fortified Harz Mountains, production ofV-weapons continued at a frenzied pace despite every indication that Germanywould soon lose the war. By late February 1945, conditions inside the Nordhausentunnels had reached a cataclysm. It was bitterly cold, thousands were starvingto death, and there was barely any food; watery broth was all the prisoners hadto live on. The Nordhausen-Dora concentration camp was being overrun with newprisoners arriving on the death marches from Auschwitz [endnotes.xhtml#en0117]and Gross-Rosen in the east. Some came on foot and others came in cattle cars.Many arrived dead. Dora’s crematorium was overwhelmed. In this climate, Wernhervon Braun and General Dornberger pressed on with plans to create a greaternumber of rockets each day.Since moving his offices from the Peenemünde facility to the Harz Mountains, vonBraun had been given a promotion [endnotes.xhtml#en0118]. Now he was head ofwhat was called the Mittelbau-Dora Planning Office, a division within Himmler’sSS. Von Braun lived just a few miles from the Nordhausen complex, in a villathat had been confiscated from a Jewish factory owner [endnotes.xhtml#en0119]years before. Each day he drove to his office in Bleicherode, eleven miles fromthe tunnel complex, where he drafted designs for new and better test stands andlaunch ramps for the V-2 [endnotes.xhtml#en0120]. Despite the reality that thewar was lost, the area was abuzz with new armaments factories being built, “dugby workers [endnotes.xhtml#en0121] from some of the forty-odd subcamps now tiedto Mittelbau-Dora,” Michael J. Neufeld explains. Von Braun’s vision was toescalate rocket production from two or three rockets a day to two hundredrockets a day. To prepare for this ambitious expansion, he commandeered[endnotes.xhtml#en0122] factories, schools, and mines throughout the region. Butrocket assembly was dependent on workers, and the slave laborers in Nordhausenwere now dying at an ever-increasing rate. Von Braun had to have known[endnotes.xhtml#en0123] this; he visited the underground tunnels in an officialcapacity ten times during the winter of 1945.For the emaciated slave laborers who had managed to stay alive, trying toassemble missiles in filthy, unfinished tunnels without food, water, orsanitation in the bitter cold of winter had become more and more difficult, andit showed in their work. In skies across Europe these hastily constructedrockets began breaking apart in flight. And in the pine forests of northernGermany, including those around the Castle Varlar, quickly assembled rocketswere exploding on their mobile launch pads. The managers at Mittelwerk suspectedsabotage. To send a message [endnotes.xhtml#en0124], public hangings were held.“Prisoners were hanged up to 57 in one day,” read one war crimes report[endnotes.xhtml#en0125]. “They were hanged in the tunnels with the help of anelectrically controlled crane, a dozen at a time, their hands bound behind theirback, a piece of wood was put in their mouth… to prevent shouting.” The hangingswere carried out directly above the V-2 production lines. Laborers were forcedto watch their fellow prisoners suffer an agonizingly slow death. In solidarity,a group of Russian and Ukrainian prisoners staged a revolt. The suspects wererounded up. Mittelwerk managers and SS guards decided to make an example ofthem. After these men were hanged, their bodies were left dangling for a day.Only after Arthur Rudolph, the Mittelwerk operations director, received a memofrom one of his German engineers asking when they were going to get their craneback [endnotes.xhtml#en0126] were the bodies taken down.In addition to von Braun’s recent promotion to head of the Mittelbau-DoraPlanning Office, he was also promoted to SS-Sturmbannführer, or SS major. One ofthe benefits [endnotes.xhtml#en0127] that came with this position was achauffeur-driven car to shuttle von Braun back and forth between Nordhausen andBerlin. It was in the backseat of this car on the night of March 12, 1945, thatvon Braun was nearly killed. As his car was speeding down the autobahn headedfor Berlin, his driver nodded off at the wheel. The car veered off the road andhurtled down a forty-foot embankment until it crashed on its side near arailroad track. The driver was knocked unconscious. Von Braun broke his arm.Both men lay bleeding in the cold, dark night when two of von Braun’s colleaguesfrom Nordhausen, facilities designer Bernhard Tessmann [endnotes.xhtml#en0128]and architect Hannes Lührsen, happened to drive by and spot the smashed-up car.They called for a military ambulance, which came to the scene and transportedvon Braun [endnotes.xhtml#en0129] and his driver to a hospital.While recuperating, von Braun received a visit from his personal aide, DieterHuzel [endnotes.xhtml#en0130], and Bernhard Tessmann, one of the two men who hadsaved von Braun’s life. Tessmann and Huzel told von Braun that the arrival ofthe U.S. Army was imminent. Any day now, they said, V-2 operations would cease.Word was going around that every man not considered a valuable scientist wasgoing to be assigned to an infantry unit, handed a weapon, and ordered to fightthe Americans on the front lines.Von Braun was now ready to concede that Germany would lose the war. What he wasunwilling to do was relinquish his career. He needed a bargaining chip to useagainst the Americans after he was captured. Von Braun told Tessmann and Huzelwhere he kept the most valuable classified V-2 documents. Because von Braun wasbedridden, he needed his two subordinates to crate up these documents and hidethem in a remote, secure place where the Allies would never find them on theirown. Von Braun told Tessmann and Huzel that if they could do this they would beincluded in von Braun’s future negotiations with the Allies. General Dornbergerwould also be part of the team. Von Braun told Tessmann and Huzel that he wouldpersonally bring the general up to speed.Mittelwerk laborers continued to produce missiles until the end of March. Thelast V-2s were fired on March 27 and the last V-1s were fired[endnotes.xhtml#en0131] the following day. On April 1, Dornberger received anorder from SS-General Kammler demanding that Dornberger evacuate his staff fromthe Mittelwerk at once. Kammler had selected five hundred key scientists andengineers who were to board his private train car, parked in Bleicherode andnicknamed the Vengeance Express, and then travel four hundred miles south intothe Bavarian Alps to hide out. Huzel and Tessmann were on Kammler’s list, butafter colluding with General Dornberger they were able to stay behind tocomplete the document stash. Von Braun, still requiring medical attention andencumbered by a heavy cast, was taken to the Alps in a private car[endnotes.xhtml#en0132]. Dornberger and his staff drove themselves, fleeing theHarz in a small convoy.When night fell on Dörnten, a small mining community at the northern edge of theHarz, the village was in a blackout. The local gauleiters (Nazi Party districtleaders) had ordered villagers to shutter their windows, turn off the lights,and stay home. It was April 4, 1945, and American forces were reportedly campedout just thirty miles to the west. The village’s cobblestone streets were empty,save a lone truck driving slowly with its lights off, navigating by the moon. Inthe front seat sat Tessmann and Huzel. In the back of the truck were sevenGerman soldiers wearing blindfolds [endnotes.xhtml#en0133]. Also in the truckwere dozens of crates filled with classified V-2 information.The truck passed through town and headed up a winding rural road leading intothe mouth of an abandoned mine. Huzel and Tessmann parked the truck and shookhands with the caretaker, Herr Nebelung, a loyal Nazi, who sold the twoengineers space in a large antechamber in the back of the Dörnten mine. Theseven soldiers were told it was okay to take off their blindfolds now and get towork.The group unloaded the crates, placed them onto flatcars, and oversaw them asthey were driven down a long tunnel by an electric-battery-powered locomotive.At the end of the tunnel, behind an iron door, was a small, dry room. The cratesof V-2 documents were packed inside, the door shut and locked. Outside, asoldier lit a stick of dynamite in front of the doorway to create a huge pile ofrubble and keep the important Nazi documents hidden [endnotes.xhtml#en0134] fromthe outside world.Huzel and Tessmann had sworn not to tell anyone what they’d done, but just asthey were leaving for Bavaria to rendezvous with Dornberger and von Braun, thetwo men decided to make an exception [endnotes.xhtml#en0135]. Karl OttoFleischer had served as the army’s business manager for the Mittelwerk slavelabor enterprise. Fleischer’s name was not on General Kammler’s list, and he’dgone home to his house in Nordhausen to blend in. Karl Fleischer was a loyalNazi who reported directly to General Dornberger during V-2 production, andHuzel and Tessmann believed Fleischer would keep their secret safe. Fleischerwas local. He could keep an eye on things and monitor if anyone started pokingaround the Dörnten mine. Huzel and Tessmann told Karl Fleischer about the secretlocation of the V-2 document stash, and with the U.S. Army just a few daysoutside Nordhausen, Huzel and Tessmann sped away."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter003]THE HUNTERS AND THE HUNTED [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter003]In France, Samuel Goudsmit and his team of Operation Alsos scientists had beenwaiting patiently since November to launch their next scientific intelligencemission [endnotes.xhtml#en0136]. It had been four months since the team hitintelligence gold, inside the Strasbourg apartment of the Reich’s virologist Dr.Eugen Haagen. Now, in the last week of March 1945, Goudsmit and his militarycommander, Colonel Boris Pash, were finally getting ready to seize their nexttargets: IG Farben factories over the border in Germany, believed to be thelocus of the Nazis’ chemical weapons program.Since November, Haagen’s apartment in Strasbourg had been serving as Alsosheadquarters. There had been long delays. In December, Hitler’s counteroffensivein the Ardennes Forest meant that Alsos scientists could not conduct frontlinemissions as planned. But as serendipity would have it, the entire first floorbelow Haagen’s Strasbourg apartment belonged to IG Farben[endnotes.xhtml#en0137], the primary chemical weapons supplier of the ThirdReich, and Alsos seized a considerable cache of documents Farben kept there.Alsos knew Farben was involved in weapons-related vaccine research and suspectedthey were involved in medical experiments on prisoners. The two Farben factoriesthey had in their sights were located only about eighty miles away, in theGerman cities of Ludwigshafen and Mannheim. For this, Operation Alsos had puttogether their largest task force to date [endnotes.xhtml#en0138]: ten civilianscientists, six military scientists, and eighteen security operators. Butventuring into German-held territory on their own was considered too dangerousfor the American scientists. They had been waiting for Allied forces to crossover the Rhine River into Germany, at which point they, too, would be allowedin. Now, in the third week of March 1945, this long-awaited crossing appearedimminent.On March 23, 1945, British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery began a colossaltroop offensive across the Rhine River, code-named Operation Plunder. Adding tothe namesake’s subtext of seizure and pillage were Montgomery’s famous words[endnotes.xhtml#en0139]: “Over the Rhine, then, let us go. And good hunting toyou all on the other side.” Sacking a vanquished country at the end of a war wasas old as war itself, but the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 prohibitedlooting beyond token items claimed as “trophies of war.” What, exactly, didMontgomery mean? On a tactical level, the Rhine River crossing meant that theAllies would smash open more than five hundred miles along the western front.From an intelligence collection standpoint, it truly meant plunder[endnotes.xhtml#en0140].As soldiers pushed forward into Germany, accompanying them were more than threethousand scientific and technical experts with the Combined IntelligenceObjectives Subcommittee, or CIOS, the joint British-American program that hadbeen established in London the summer before. CIOS teams [endnotes.xhtml#en0154]reported to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces, or SHAEF, locatedin Versailles and staffed by experts: scientists, engineers, doctors, andtechnicians accompanied by linguists and scholars to translate and interpret thedocuments that were seized. Representing the United States[endnotes.xhtml#en0141] from CIOS were men from the War Department GeneralStaff, the navy, the Army Air Forces, the State Department, the Foreign EconomicAdministration, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), and the Office ofScientific Research and Development. The British sent experts from the ForeignOffice, the Admiralty, the Air Ministry, and the Ministries of Supply, AircraftProduction, Economic Warfare, Fuel and Power. All CIOS staff worked from a listof targets, similar to those used by Alsos, which became known as Black Lists[endnotes.xhtml#en0142]. Frontline requests [endnotes.xhtml#en0143] for specificCIOS teams were relayed to SHAEF from the combat zone. An appropriate CIOS teamwould be dispatched into the field.Assisting CIOS teams were security forces called T-Forces, identifiable byhelmets with a bright red T painted [endnotes.xhtml#en0144] on the front. Thesesmall squadrons of elite soldiers operated at the army group level but workedindependently of traditional combat units. Their job was to recognizepotentially valuable scientific targets and then secure them until personnelfrom CIOS arrived.The goal of Combined Intelligence Objectives Subcommittee was to investigate allthings related to German science. Target types ran the gamut: radar, missiles,aircraft, medicine, bombs and fuses, chemical and biological weapons labs. Andwhile CIOS remained an official joint venture, there were other groups in themix, with competing interests at hand.Running parallel to CIOS operations were dozens of secret intelligence-gatheringoperations, mostly American. The Pentagon’s Special Mission V-2 was but oneexample. By late March 1945, Colonel Trichel, chief of U.S. Army Ordnance,Rocket Branch, had dispatched his team to Europe [endnotes.xhtml#en0145].Likewise, U.S. Naval Technical Intelligence had officers in Paris preparing forits own highly classified hunt for any intelligence regarding the Henschel Hs293, a guided missile developed by the Nazis and designed to sink or damageenemy ships. The U.S. Army Air Forces (AAF) were still heavily engaged instrategic bombing campaigns, but a small group from Wright Field, near Dayton,Ohio, was laying plans to locate and capture Luftwaffe equipment and engineers.Spearheading Top Secret missions for British intelligence was a group ofcommandos called 30 Assault Unit [endnotes.xhtml#en0146], led by Ian Fleming,the personal assistant to the director of British naval intelligence and futureauthor of the James Bond novels. Sometimes, the members of these parallelmissions worked in consort with CIOS officers in the field. Certainly, they tookfull advantage of all the information CIOS made available, including its BlackLists. But each mission almost always put its individual objectives and goalsfirst. The result, some officers joked, was CHAOS for CIOS[endnotes.xhtml#en0147].What began as a gentlemanly collaboration among Allies quickly transformed intoone of the greatest competitions [endnotes.xhtml#en0148] for information aboutweapons-related research in the history of war. Once the Rhine River wascrossed, the hunt for Nazi science became a free-for-all.On its search for chemical weapons, Alsos scientists crossed the Rhine on theheels of the Third Army. They traveled in a small convoy of army jeeps. “Thearea was not in good shape [endnotes.xhtml#en0149],” Colonel Pash recalled afterthe war. “Buildings of the town shook from the shock waves generated by the gunexplosions,” and “stalled or broken-down vehicles added to the confusion createdby the wrecked armor and trucks of the retreating Nazis.” Entering Ludwigshafen,one of the Alsos jeeps became separated from its convoy and ran smack into theline of fire of a German antitank gun. Hardly expecting a single jeep to appearon the road without a tank accompanying it, the Germans were apparently caughtoff-guard. “A single salvo [endnotes.xhtml#en0150] and the few machine-gunbursts went wide,” Pash recalled after the war.The Alsos scientists had heard that T-Forces units were close behind them andwere making arrangements for a large team of technical experts to arrive underthe CIOS banner. The Alsos scientists were determined to get to the IG Farbenfactory first. But what they ended up finding in Ludwigshafen was disappointingto them. Not only had the factory been heavily damaged [endnotes.xhtml#en0151]by Allied bombing raids, but filing cabinets were empty. Paperwork had beendestroyed or removed [endnotes.xhtml#en0152]. There were no chemical weaponsfound.The following morning, March 24, 1945, while at breakfast, the Alsos team met upwith the T-Forces and the CIOS team. Both had come to inspect the Farbenfactory. “It was interesting to watch the effect of bombshells casually droppedby our scientists,” Pash recalled, “sounding something like… ‘Oh sure, You’ll beable to go to the Farben plant tomorrow, after the T-Forces secures it. You’llfind it interesting. We know, because we were there yesterday.’ ” The rivalrybetween the teams was evident.The two men leading the CIOS chemical weapons team were an American officernamed Lieutenant Colonel Philip R. Tarr [endnotes.xhtml#en0153] and a Britishofficer named Major Edmund Tilley. These men would soon become critical playersin the Operation Paperclip story. Each was considered an expert in chemicalwarfare, but Major Tilley had a leg up on his American counterpart—at least inthe field—in that he spoke fluent German. In addition to his role as a CIOSleader, Colonel Tarr was chief officer in the U.S. Army’s Intelligence Divisionof the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service, Europe. Unknown to Major Tilley at thistime was that Colonel Tarr’s U.S. Army objective would soon supersede hisloyalty to their work together as a CIOS team.With American forces now on German soil, the fear that Hitler might unleash adevastating chemical weapons attack in a last-ditch attempt to make good on hiswonder weapons promise was real, but Tarr and Tilley had very few leads as towhere the chemical weapons might be stashed. German counterintelligence agentshad done a brilliant job concealing the Reich’s nerve agent programs fromforeign intelligence agencies during the war. Tabun had been given various codenames, including Trilon 83, Substance 83, and Gelan 1. Even its raw materialswere coded [endnotes.xhtml#en0155]. Ethanol was “A4,” and sodium was “A-17,”making identification all but impossible. In 1942, a U.S. intelligence reportentitled “New German Poison Gas” concluded that the possibility that Germany hadnew chemical weapons was “no longer seriously regarded.” Only in May of 1943,after capturing a German chemist in North Africa, did British agents learn of acolorless nerve agent of “astounding properties” being developed by IG Farbenchemists in Berlin. The British interrogation officers found the Germanchemist’s information to be credible and wrote up a ten-page secret report forthe Chemical Defense Experimental Establishment, which operated out of PortonDown. But the captured scientist knew only the substance’s code name, Trilon 83.Without further information, no action was taken by the British. Now, in March1945, Tarr and Tilley were on the hunt for this mysterious Trilon 83 andanything else like it.Leading the CIOS team into Germany, Tarr and Tilley inspected IG Farbenfactories at Ludwigshafen, Mannheim, and Elberfeld. At each location theofficers noted with suspicion how remarkably little each town’s Farbenscientists claimed to know. As far as intelligence collection was concerned, thescenario at each seized Farben factory was always strikingly similar: Wherethere should have been huge troves of company records, there were empty cabinetsinstead. Farben scientists who were taken into custody and questioned alwayssaid the same thing [endnotes.xhtml#en0156]: IG Farben made chemical productsfor domestic use—detergent, paint, lacquer, and soap. And none of the scientistsinterviewed by CIOS officers claimed to have any idea where the bosses had gone.In a CIOS memorandum, Tilley and Tarr expressed mounting frustration. Onescientist after the next “lied vigorously [endnotes.xhtml#en0157] about hisactivities,” the men wrote in their intelligence report, entitled “Interrogationof German Scientific Personnel.” Good, actionable intelligence remained out ofreach. Then, as circumstance would have it, Alsos agents caught a huge breakfarther north in the city of Bonn.Alsos had been trailing [endnotes.xhtml#en0158] the Third Armored Division sinceit first rolled into Ludwigshafen on March 23. Several days later the soldiersliberated the city of Cologne and then set their sights on Bonn, some fifteenmiles to the north. Scouting soldiers reported seeing men who might beprofessors burning caseloads of documents in Bonn University courtyards. Whatthey couldn’t see was that inside university bathrooms, professors were alsodesperately flushing documents down the toilet [endnotes.xhtml#en0159], hopingto destroy evidence that might implicate them in war crimes. When the Alliesfinally secured the university, a Polish lab technician approached a Britishsoldier to say that he had salvaged a large pile of documents that did notproperly flush down a toilet bowl, as had apparently been intended.These papers looked important, the lab technician said. And indeed they were.The man had turned over to British intelligence a classified list of the Reich’stop scientists. The officer handed the list over to Samuel Goudsmit of OperationAlsos. This group of documents would lead to what would become known as theOsenberg List.Dr. Werner Osenberg, a mechanical engineer, was a dedicated Nazi and member ofthe SS; he was also a high-ranking member of the Gestapo, the secret police. InJune 1943 Osenberg was assigned by Göring [endnotes.xhtml#en0160] to run theso-called Planning Office of the Reich Research Council, which was dedicated towarfare. Per a Führer decree of June 9, 1942, the Research Council’s charterread: “Leading men of science [endnotes.xhtml#en0161] above all, are to makeresearch fruitful for warfare by working together in their special fields.”From the council’s Planning Office, Osenberg’s job was to coordinate a Who’s Wholist of German scientists, engineers, doctors, and technicians. Withbureaucratic precision Osenberg set to work, tracking down and cataloguing everyscientist in Germany. Osenberg’s mission was to put these men into service forthe Reich. In short order he had compiled a list of fifteen thousand men andfourteen hundred research facilities. All across Germany scientists, engineers,and technicians were recalled from the front lines, an act Hitler called theOsenberg Action. This led to the release [endnotes.xhtml#en0162] of fivethousand scientists from the German Armed Forces. After being screened for skilllevel, the men of science were set up in appropriated universities andinstitutions across Reich territory where they could work on weapons-relatedresearch programs [endnotes.xhtml#en0163] in service of the war effort.The mystery of how the Osenberg List ended up in a Bonn University toilet wasnever solved, but for Alsos it was an intelligence gold mine. Not only was thislist a record of who had been working on what scientific project for the Reich,but it contained addresses, including one for Werner Osenberg himself. Goudsmitdispatched a team to a little town near Hannover. There, Alsos agents capturedOsenberg [endnotes.xhtml#en0164] and his complete outfit.The papers found in the toilet were valuable, but it was an index of cards[endnotes.xhtml#en0165] in Osenberg’s office that was priceless. “The primaryindex consists of a four-drawer cabinet containing approximately two-thousandlarge printed cards (10″ x 7″) adapted for multiple entry on both sides of thecard,” reported Alsos. Secondary indexes included three additional sets of“approximately one thousand cards [each], 6″ x 4″… containing the sameinformation but classified from a different standpoint and facilitating searchesalong different lines.” This was an overwhelming trove of information, too muchfor any one organization to handle. Alsos shared the Osenberg List with CIOS;there were thousands of leads that needed following up on. Osenberg’s cardcatalogue would allow the various teams to begin piecing together how scienceprograms worked under the Reich and who had been in charge.The Alsos officers packed up Osenberg’s office and took him to Paris, where hewas put to work organizing information. Goudsmit was appalled by the hubris[endnotes.xhtml#en0166] Osenberg displayed after he was installed in an officein a guarded facility in Versailles. “Here, Osenberg had set up business asusual; he merely had his secretary change the address on his letterhead to… “atPresent in Paris,” Goudsmit explained after the war. He also became exasperatedwhen Osenberg tried repeatedly to convince Goudsmit of his sworn loyalty to theAllies. “I became impatient,” Goudsmit explained, and told Osenberg, “[O]necannot trust you [endnotes.xhtml#en0167].… You were in charge of the scientificsection of the Gestapo, which you never revealed to us and you burned all therelating papers.” Osenberg was enraged by the accusation. “No, I did not burnthose papers,” he told Goudsmit. “I buried them and, moreover, I was not thechief of the scientific section of the Gestapo, I was merely the second incommand.” After that it was easy for Goudsmit to find out from Osenberg “wherethose papers were buried and where the missing Berlin papers were stored.”But no one from the Allied forces was going into Berlin just yet. In these lastdays of March 1945, Berlin continued to be the heart of the Reich, and it wasbeing fiercely defended. It would remain German-held territory for anothermonth, until the last day of April 1945.It was a city in ruins, and Berliners’ morale was sinking with each passing day.With nearly 85 percent of the city destroyed [endnotes.xhtml#en0168], Berlin hadbeen reduced to rubble piles. The majority of buildings still standing hadbroken windows. Everyone was cold. The underground shelters were vastlyovercrowded. Heating fuel was scarce. “During early April,” explains historianAnthony Beevor, “as Berlin awaited [endnotes.xhtml#en0169] the final onslaught[of the Red Army,] the atmosphere in the city became a mixture of febrileexhaustion, terrible foreboding and despair.”Nazi radio broadcasts reminded Berliners that they were required to fight to theend. According to Goebbels, “A single motto remains for us: ‘Conquer or die.’ ”Hitler blamed everything on the Jews and the Slavs. “The deadly Jewish-Bolshevik[endnotes.xhtml#en0170] enemy with his masses is beginning his final attack,” hetold troops on the eastern front, in a last appeal on April 15. The Russianswere determined to exterminate all German people, Hitler promised, “the old menand children will be murdered, women and girls will be degraded as barrackswhores.” Everybody else would be marched off to Siberia.In the heart of Berlin, in the Wilhelmstrasse district, where the Reich’sministries were located, Colonel Siegfried Knemeyer tried to maintain order overthe vast group of personnel he was responsible for at the Air Ministry. It was amiracle that the building was still standing. Constructed of reinforcedconcrete, the Air Ministry was a prized symbol of Nazi Party intimidationarchitecture, seven stories tall, with twenty-eight hundred rooms, four thousandwindows, and corridors that totaled four miles in length. At the height of theair war, the place bustled with four thousand Nazi bureaucrats[endnotes.xhtml#en0171] and their secretaries. This was no longer the case. TheLuftwaffe was in ruins.Since 1943, Siegfried Knemeyer had served as chief of all air force technicaldevelopments for the Luftwaffe. His title was technical adviser toReichsmarschall Göring, who adored Knemeyer [endnotes.xhtml#en0172], calling him“my boy.” From aircraft engines to instruments, if a new component was beingdeveloped for the Luftwaffe, Göring wanted to know what Knemeyer had to sayabout it before he gave the project the go-ahead. But now, in the second week ofApril 1945, most orders that arrived at the Air Ministry were impossible forKnemeyer to fulfill. In the second half of 1944, the German Air Force had lostmore than twenty thousand airplanes [endnotes.xhtml#en0173]. The Speer ministryhad since managed to produce approximately three thousand new aircraft, but theywere of little use now. Across the Reich, German aircraft sat stranded ontarmacs. The Allies had bombed Luftwaffe runways, and there was barely anyaviation fuel left. The plan for IG Farben to make synthetic fuel at its Bunafactory had ended when the Red Army liberated Auschwitz on January 27, 1945.Germany’s fuel sources in Hungary and Romania were tapped out. The German jetwas superior to conventional Allied fighter planes in the air, but that didn’tmean much [endnotes.xhtml#en0174] anymore, with most Luftwaffe aircraft stuck onthe ground.Soon Knemeyer would flee Berlin, but not before he completed a final taskassigned to him by Speer. According to Nuremberg trial testimony, Speerinstructed Knemeyer to hide Luftwaffe technical information in the forestoutside Berlin. Stashing official documents was a treasonable offense, butaccording to Knemeyer’s personal papers, Speer and Knemeyer had agreed[endnotes.xhtml#en0175] that Germany’s seminal scientific progress inaeronautics could not, under any circumstances, fall into Russian hands. Therewas also a second unofficial job that Speer tapped Knemeyer for, one that wasnot discussed at Nuremberg but which Speer admitted to decades later. Speerasked Knemeyer to help plot his escape.Speer’s plan to flee Germany had been in the works for some time; it was thedetails he needed help ironing out. Ever since Speer had seen the film S.O.S.Iceberg, starring Leni Riefenstahl and Ernst Udet, he knew he wanted to escapeto Greenland [endnotes.xhtml#en0176] should Germany lose the war. In GreenlandSpeer could set up camp and write his memoirs, he later explained. Of coursehe’d need a pilot, which is where Knemeyer fit in.Knemeyer was an aeronautical engineer, but he was also one of the Luftwaffe’smost revered pilots, ranked among the top ten aviators in all of Germany. Hisspecialty, back when he flew missions in the earlier stages of the war, had beenespionage. From 1938 to 1942, Knemeyer flew a number of the most dangerousAbwehr (military intelligence) missions on record, including ones over Englandand Norway. And it was Knemeyer who made the first high-altitude sortie[endnotes.xhtml#en0177] over North Africa, flying at forty-four thousand feet.But Knemeyer was also a pragmatist. He knew, apparently more so than Speer, thatattempting to fly out of Germany and into Greenland transporting one of the mostwanted war criminals of the Third Reich during the final days of the war wouldbe a near-to-impossible feat. There was brutal weather in Greenland and fierceterrain. The mission would require a very specific aircraft that could handlethe harsh conditions and difficult landing, namely, the Bv 222, designed byBlohm & Voss. Only thirteen had ever been built. There was only one man who hadaccess to that kind of airplane, and that was Knemeyer’s friend Werner Baumbach,a twenty-eight-year-old dive-bomber pilot whom Hitler had made general of thebombers.Knemeyer knew that bringing Baumbach on board was imperative for a successfulGreenland escape. During the war, Baumbach had flown missions between Norway anda German weather station located in Greenland. Speer agreed and Baumbach wasbrought into the plan. In secret, Baumbach and Knemeyer began gathering[endnotes.xhtml#en0178] “food, medicine, rifles, skis, tents, fishing equipmentand hand grenades” at Speer’s behest. At the Travemünde airfield, north ofBerlin, Baumbach earmarked a Bv 222 for use. The only thing that remained wasSpeer’s command [endnotes.xhtml#en0179] for the group to flee. Time was runningout. Berlin was nearing its downfall."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter004]LIBERATION [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter004]All across Germany, the liberations were beginning. In one location after thenext, prisoners in concentration camps and slave labor factories were beingfreed by Allied soldiers who stormed across Germany in tanks and jeeps and onfoot. The action had begun in western Germany and continued steadily as theAllies marched east, headed toward Munich and Berlin. Alongside theseliberations, soldiers also discovered Reich laboratories and researchfacilities, one after the next. After each discovery a team of CIOS scientistswas called in to investigate. During the second week of April in 1945, four keyfacilities were seized—at Nordhausen, Geraberg, Völkenrode, and Raubkammer—eachof which would lead to the capture of key scientists who would in turn becomepart of Operation Paperclip.On the morning of April 11, 1945, a unit of American soldiers with the 104thInfantry Division, also known as the Timberwolves, entered the slave tunnels atNordhausen. Among the liberating soldiers was an infantry sharpshooter, aprivate first class named John Risen Jones Jr. In his bag he carried a camera, agift given to him by his family before he shipped off to war. Expensive andsleek-looking, Jones’s [endnotes.xhtml#en0180] Leica III was one of the firstportable 35 mm cameras ever made.It had been seven months since John Risen Jones landed in France, back inSeptember 1944. He had spent 195 days on the continent thus far, many of themengaged in fierce combat, all the while pushing though snow, sleet, and mud—muchof it on foot. Jones had walked across France, Belgium, and Holland, and nowhere he was, in the deep mountains of central Germany, the Harz. He had lostfriends in battle and taken many photographs of the war. When his unit arrivedin this little mountain town, he imagined the day would pass like the onebefore. Just one step closer to the end of this brutal war.No amount of fighting prepared John Risen Jones for what he saw through the lensof his Leica when his unit entered Nordhausen. The photographs he tookdocumented the tragedy that had befallen thousands of V-2 rocket laborerscondemned to die as slaves in the tunnels here. Hundreds of corpses werestretched out across the tunnel floors. Equally disturbing was the condition ofhundreds more still alive: emaciated humans covered with bruises and sores, tooweak to even stand. “It was a fabric of moans [endnotes.xhtml#en0181] andwhimpers of delirium and outright madness,” recalled fellow soldier StaffSergeant Donald Schulz. John Risen Jones would not speak of it for fifty-oneyears.Following along behind the soldiers was a team of seven war crimes investigators[endnotes.xhtml#en0182]. Among them was a young Dutch officer working for theU.S. Army, William J. Aalmans. Like John Risen Jones, Aalmans was deeplyaffected by what he saw and smelled. “Stench, the tuberculosis and the starvedinmates,” he told journalist Tom Bower after the war. “Four people were dyingevery hour [endnotes.xhtml#en0183]. It was unbelievable.” Aalmans and his teambegan taking witness statements from prisoners, who sipped watered-down milk forstrength. The job facing the war crimes investigators was overwhelming, andtheir schedule was intense. After five days in Nordhausen they were ordered tomove on. Most of the official paperwork regarding rocket production had beenhidden or destroyed, but Aalmans and his team found a single sheet of paperinadvertently left behind, tacked to the wall. It was the Mittelwerk telephonelist; a directory of who was in charge. At the very top were two names: GeorgRickhey, director of production, and Arthur Rudolph, deputy production manager.Aalmans found the document interesting enough to staple it to the report.Although it would take years to come to light, this single sheet of paper wouldeventually lead to the downfall of Rudolph and Rickhey and threaten to exposethe dark secrets of Operation Paperclip.Seventy-five miles south of Nordhausen, in the Thuringian Forest at the edge ofthe Harz, Allied soldiers liberated the town of Geraberg. Here, they came upon acurious-looking research facility concealed in a thick grove of trees. Clearlythe place had recently been abandoned. It comprised a laboratory, an isolationblock, animal houses, and living quarters for fourteen men. Part of the facilitywas still under construction. Word was sent to SHAEF headquarters in Versaillesthat a team of bacteriologists was needed in Geraberg. Alsos scientists weredispatched to investigate. One of the first biological warfare experts to arrivewas Bill Cromartie, who had been hunting for evidence of Hitler’s biologicalweapons program since the mission began back in Strasbourg, France. Back inNovember, Cromartie had been one of the men scouring files with Samuel Goudsmit,inside the apartment of Dr. Eugen Haagen, when Alsos agents first learned thatthe Reich was testing deadly vaccines on prisoners in concentration camps.Arriving at Geraberg, Cromartie determined that the laboratory here was asignificant lead.“The building and sites [endnotes.xhtml#en0184] were on either side of a smallvalley and constructed under tall trees,” read Cromartie’s classified report.“On one side there was a building [that] was to have been the experimentallaboratory,” he surmised, suggesting that this facility was designed to produceexperimental vaccines to protect German soldiers against a biological weaponsoffensive.A local villager provided Cromartie and a colleague, J. M. Barnes, with two keypieces of information in the biological weapons puzzle. The villager explainedthat an SS man named Dr. Karl Gross had been overseeing work at this facility.Gross kept dozens of trunks and boxes locked in the upper floors of a localschoolhouse, and, while he had recently disappeared, he had left the trunksbehind. The villager took the American scientists to the schoolhouse toinvestigate.An inventory was taken of Dr. Gross’s possessions [endnotes.xhtml#en0185],mostly laboratory equipment. “There were crates of test tubes and small flasksand large numbers of test tube racks. There were two incubators and anautoclave. There were two boxes of gas mask filters and some rubber hoods andgowns,” read the report. Everything was military-grade protective gear, markedas having “been obtained from the Hygiene Institute of the Waffen SS.” There wasalso a large collection of books, “several boxes of periodicals all dealing withinfectious diseases.” The ones that really caught the scientists’ attention were“Russian contributions on plague [endnotes.xhtml#en0186].”Next, the villager took the Alsos agents to the nearby boardinghouse where Dr.Gross had been renting a room. The place was cleared out and void of personalpossessions. “His landlady said she believed he had burnt a lot of papers thenight before he left,” the Alsos scientists noted in their report[endnotes.xhtml#en0187]. But Dr. Gross was only the intermediary, the landladysaid. There was another man who came to the facility and appeared to be incharge. He was an older man, about fifty, five foot nine, with a mustache andblack hair. On his upper lip he had a pronounced dueling scar. He had to havebeen of high rank, because everyone on the staff deferred to him. Whencross-referenced by Alsos against the Osenberg List, the situation became evenclearer: Dr. Karl Gross worked under Dr. Kurt Blome, the individual in charge ofbiological weapons research and the deputy surgeon general of the Third Reich.All indicators pointed to the idea that Geraberg was a Reich facility forbiological weapons research. Alsos agents photographed the site: the animalhouse, the vaccine station, the experimental laboratory, and the isolationhospital. They typed up a report and filed it away for future use. Now, near thetop of the biological weapons Black List was the name Dr. Kurt Blome.Sixty miles north of Nordhausen, a battalion of American soldiers with the FirstU.S. Infantry moved cautiously through the forest on the western edge of a smallcity called Braunschweig. It was April 13, 1945, when they came upon a compoundof about seventy buildings. Great care had gone into camouflaging this place,the soldiers noted. Thousands of trees had been planted closely so that the areawould appear from the air to be dense forest. The buildings in the compound hadbeen designed to look like simple farmhouses. Traditional gardens had beenplanted and tended to. Stork nests covered the rooftops.Inside the buildings, soldiers discovered state-of-the-art aircraftlaboratories, including entire warehouses filled with airplane parts and rocketfuel. There were wind and weapons tunnels that were radically more advanced thananything the Army Air Forces had at Wright Field. The oldest division in theUnited States Army had unexpectedly happened upon the most scientificallyadvanced aeronautics laboratory in the world. It was called the Hermann GöringAeronautical Research Center at Völkenrode [endnotes.xhtml#en0188]. The Allieshad never heard of it before. It didn’t appear on any CIOS Black List. It was anincredible find.At first, it seemed as if the place had been abandoned. But after an hour oflooking around, the soldiers came upon the institute’s scientific director, aman named Adolf Busemann. Busemann told the soldiers that this facility wascalled Völkenrode for short, and that it had been up and running for ten years.A team of Army Air Forces technical intelligence experts, working as part of amission called Operation Lusty [endnotes.xhtml#en0189] and stationed inSaint-Germain, France, was dispatched to investigate. By now the U.S. StrategicAir Forces in Europe had destroyed the Luftwaffe, and the bombing campaign hadessentially stopped. Its commander, General Carl A. “Tooey” Spaatz, had justreceived a fourth star for his success commanding the largest fleet of combataircraft ever assembled for war. Now Spaatz had a new mission for his fieldcommanders. “Operation Lusty,” Spaatz wrote in a memo, was “in effect,” andeveryone “not engaged in critical operational duties” was to seek out “technicaland scientific intelligence [that would be] of material assistance in theprosecution of the war against Japan.” The man Spaatz chose to lead the hunt forLuftwaffe scientists and engineers was Colonel Donald L. Putt.When Putt arrived [endnotes.xhtml#en0190] at Völkenrode on April 22, 1945, hewas thrilled by what he saw. All he could think about was how quickly he couldget all this equipment back to the United States. Putt was a legendary testpilot [endnotes.xhtml#en0191] who had been at Wright Field since 1933, assignedto various branches, including the Flying Branch. He had walked away from adeadly air crash that killed his colleagues and left him with second-degree burnscars on his face and neck. Putt was a hard-charging, Type A personality—a tigeramong men. “He displayed the ability [endnotes.xhtml#en0192] to withstand greatemotional shock, to absorb it, and take in stride,” explained a colleague fromWright Field. Putt was also intellectually gifted, with a degree in electricalengineering from the Carnegie Institute of Technology and a master’s inaeronautical engineering from the California Institute of Technology. As anolder man, Donald Putt recalled the prewar mind-set regarding pilots who werealso engineers. “Then, the philosophy was, ‘Don’t put an engineering pilot inthe cockpit, because he tries to figure out why things happen.’ ” But when theair wars in Europe and Japan escalated, the Army Air Forces found itself in needof fast, out-of-the-box thinking from American pilot-engineers like Putt. TheArmy Air Forces put the old philosophy to the side and Putt’s expertise to use.In 1944, Putt’s career milestone arrived when he was put in charge of modifyinga B-29 bomber so that it could deliver an extraordinarily heavy, Top Secretpayload on Japan. This payload was eventually revealed [endnotes.xhtml#en0193]to be the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After Putt finishedhis B-29 bomber retrofitting jobs, in January 1945, he was sent overseas asdirector of technical services for the Air Service Command. Now here he was inthe last week of April 1945 at Völkenrode.With his engineer’s expertise, Putt was able to clearly judge the revolutionarynature of the technology he was looking at. Most astonishing to Putt wereVölkenrode’s seven wind tunnels that had allowed the Luftwaffe to study how aswept-back wing would behave at the speed at which an aircraft broke the soundbarrier. This transition place, between Mach 0.8 and Mach 1.2, was still unknownto American fliers [endnotes.xhtml#en0194] in 1945. When Putt learned[endnotes.xhtml#en0195] from Völkenrode’s director, Adolf Busemann, that thesound barrier had already been breached by German scientists in these windtunnels, he was amazed. Putt knew immediately that the facility had “the mostsuperb instruments [endnotes.xhtml#en0196] and test equipment” in the world.Putt was taking orders from the U.S. Army, European Theater of Operations,Directorate of Intelligence, Exploitation Division, which meant that he hadaccess to stripped-down B-17s and B-24s if he needed them, a means to transportmuch of this equipment to the United States, which Putt very much wanted to do.He wrote to his boss, Major General Hugh Knerr, deputy commander of U.S.Strategic Air Force in Europe, outlining his proposition and suggesting a secondidea: Why not also fly [endnotes.xhtml#en0197] scientists like Adolf Busemannout of Germany, along with the captured Luftwaffe equipment? “If we are not tooproud [endnotes.xhtml#en0198] to make use of this German-born information, muchbenefit can be derived from it and we can advance where Germany left off,” Puttwrote. The German scientists “would be of immense value in our jet engine andairplane development program.” Putt and Knerr both knew that the War DepartmentGeneral Staff was filled with individuals who were wary of Germans in generaland totally opposed to making deals of any kind with the very Nazi scientistswho had helped to prolong the war. But if anyone could get the War Department tobend, Knerr and Putt believed they could [endnotes.xhtml#en0199].Major General Knerr sent a memo to the War Department in Washington, D.C.,explaining that using Luftwaffe technology to fight the war in Japan wasimperative. He added that the scientists’ Nazi Party membership needed to beoverlooked. “Pride and face saving [endnotes.xhtml#en0200] have no place innational insurance,” wrote Knerr.The War Department General Staff was not so easily convinced—at least not now.Colonel Putt was informed that the equipment could come out of Völkenrodeimmediately but that getting German scientists to Wright Field would take somemore time. Putt oversaw the massive airlift of German aircraft and rocket partsfrom Völkenrode to the United States; five thousand scientific documents werealso shipped. Meanwhile, he and his staff rounded up as many Luftwaffe personnelas they could, tracking down leads and making deals with scientists andengineers in their homes. Putt informed the Germans that he could not offer themU.S. Army contracts just yet but that he would most likely be able to do sosoon. In the meantime, he arranged for dozens of Luftwaffe scientists andengineers to be quartered in the Hotel Wittelsbacher Hof, in the spa town of BadKissingen, and made sure that the men had plenty to eat, drink, and smoke. Waithere, the scientists were told. The U.S. Army contracts are on the way.Colonel Putt and Major General Knerr would then put their heads together andfigure out a way to convince the War Department that their point of view wasbest for the United States.Around this time, the single largest cache of chemical weapons discovered todate was found seventy-five miles west of Hannover. On April 16, 1945, Britishsoldiers from Montgomery’s Twenty-first Army Group pulled up to the entrance ofan abandoned German army proving ground called the Robbers’ Lair, or Raubkammer.The place appeared to be abandoned, but Waffen-SS snipers still were known to behiding in the woods. The soldiers exercised caution as they drove their armoredpersonnel cars through a pair of entrance pillars adorned with Reich eagles andswastikas.At first glance the facility looked like a standard military proving ground—aplace where bombs were exploded and blast measurements recorded. Raubkammer waslocated in a rural forested area called Münster-Nord, and it extended more thanseventy-six square miles. Large craters in open fields suggested that Luftwaffeairplanes had practiced dropping bombs here. There was fancy housing forhundreds of officers. There were large administrative buildings and an officers’mess hall. Then the soldiers came upon the zoo.It was a large zoo, capable of housing a vast array of animals of all sizes.There were cages for mice, cats, and dogs, as well as large pens and stables forfarm animals like horses, cows, and pigs. There were also monkey cages. But itwas the discovery of a massive, round wooden cylinder—most likely an aerosolchamber—that triggered alarm. The structure was sixty-five feet tall and ahundred feet wide, and it was ringed with a network of scaffolding, pipes, andventilator fans. Between the zoo and the large chamber, the soldiers were nowrelatively certain that Raubkammer was no ordinary military proving ground. TheRobbers’ Lair bore the hallmarks of a field-testing facility that likelyinvolved poison gas. An urgent memo was sent to SHAEF asking for a team ofchemical warfare experts to be dispatched to Raubkammer [endnotes.xhtml#en0201].Two teams descended, one from the British Chemical Defense ExperimentalEstablishment at Porton Down and another from CIOS, including Major Tilley andColonel Tarr.At the same time, a second unit of British troops working just a few miles tothe southwest of the Robbers’ Lair came upon two bunker clusters totaling almosttwo hundred structures. The area had been artfully concealed from overhead viewby dense forest cover. The first cluster consisted of several dozen small woodenbuildings intermittently spaced between similarly sized concrete blockhouses.The soldiers inventoried the contents with caution. Inside one set of bunkersthey found thousands of bombs, stacked in neat piles. Each bomb was marked witha single yellow ring [endnotes.xhtml#en0202] painted around the sides of themunition. This was the standard marking to denote mustard gas, the chemicalweapon used by both sides in World War I. The British soldiers took inventoryand counted one hundred thousand mustard gas shells.The second munitions depot was marked as belonging to the Luftwaffe. Here, 175bunkers were filled with bombs that were unidentifiable to the Allies. Each bombhad been marked with three green rings painted around its sides. Montgomery’ssoldiers sent an urgent memo to SHAEF asking for a team of chemical weaponsexperts to come investigate the munitions in the forest.The scientists from CIOS and Porton Down were nervous about what might be insidethe mysteriously marked bombs. They decided that it was best to try to locateGerman scientists in the area who might be familiar with the contents of thebombs before they opened the casings themselves—so they began knocking on thedoors of the nicer houses in the vicinity of Robbers’ Lair. As they hadsuspected they would, CIOS officers located a number of individuals whoconfessed to being German army scientists and having worked at Raubkammer. Whileeach scientist claimed to have no idea what kind of weapons testing had beengoing on at the military facility, CIOS officers were able to persuade severalof the German scientists to assist them in extracting the liquid substance[endnotes.xhtml#en0203] from the center of the bombs.By this time, chemists with the U.S. Army’s Forty-fifth Chemical LaboratoryCompany had arrived, bringing with them a mobile laboratory unit and cagesfilled with rabbits. The original thought was that the substance marked by threegreen rings was some kind of new Nazi blister agent—similar to, but perhaps morepowerful than, mustard gas. The chemists were wrong. Extractions were made, andwhen tested on the rabbits in the mobile laboratory, whatever this liquidsubstance was killed a warm-blooded rabbit five times faster than anything thatBritish or American scientists had ever seen, or even heard about, before. Evenmore alarming, the liquid substance did not have to be inhaled to kill. A singledrop on the rabbit’s skin [endnotes.xhtml#en0204] killed the animal in just afew minutes. The millions of gas masks England had distributed to city dwellersduring the war would have offered no defense against a chemical weapon as potentas whatever this killing agent was.CIOS field agents wrote up a Top Secret report for their superiors at SHAEF. Amenacing new breed of chemical weapons [endnotes.xhtml#en0205] had beendiscovered. Aerial bombs “found to contain a markedly potent and hithertounknown organophosphorus nerve agent” had been developed by the Nazis during thewar and stashed in two hundred bunkers in the forest nearby. No chemical thislethal to man had ever been developed before. CIOS agents did not know it yet,but this nerve agent was tabun. The three green rings had been painted on theLuftwaffe bombs at Farben’s Dyhernfurth facility in Poland.Allied chemical weapons experts were suddenly in possession of one of the mostdangerous wonder weapons—and one of the best-kept secrets—of the Third Reich.That these weapons were never used was astonishing.Who were the scientists who had discovered this nerve agent, and where were theynow?Underground in the center of Berlin, in a makeshift hospital set up in a subwaytunnel [endnotes.xhtml#en0206] beneath the Reich Chancellery, Major General Dr.Walter Schreiber performed emergency surgeries on wounded Wehrmacht soldiers. Hegave blood transfusions, performed amputations—whatever it was that needed to bedone. As surgeon general of the Third Reich, Schreiber was not a hospital doctoraccustomed to dealing with triage. But, as he would later testify at Nuremberg,all of his physician-colleagues had fled Berlin; this was not necessarily thetruth [endnotes.xhtml#en0207]. Schreiber was a short, squat man, five foot six,with blond hair, blue eyes, and a nose that ended in a fleshy point. A man ofgreat willpower and stamina, he prided himself as setting his mind to a task andgetting it done.Today was the Führer’s fifty-sixth birthday, April 20, 1945. And because it wasHitler’s birthday, this Berlin morning began with Propaganda Minister JosephGoebbels’s Happy Birthday broadcast [endnotes.xhtml#en0208], calling on allGermans to trust Hitler and to follow him faithfully to the bitter end. WhileMajor General Dr. Schreiber performed surgeries in his makeshift undergroundhospital, a group of his Nazi Party colleagues had gathered for a party almostdirectly above where he was located, in the half-destroyed Reich Chancellerybuilding. Around noon, Hitler’s inner circle made its way into a cavernous roomwith polished marble walls and floor-to-ceiling doors: Speer, Göring, Himmler,SA-Obergruppenführer and police and Waffen-SS general Ernst Kaltenbrunner, NaziParty foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz of thenavy, Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel, military commander Alfred Jodl, andSS-Brigadeführer Hans Krebs. The men gathered around an enormous table coveredwith bottles of champagne and a spread of food. Hitler said a few words[endnotes.xhtml#en0209] and promised that the Russians would soon suffer theirmost crushing defeat yet.That morning, the Red Army had in fact begun its final assault on Berlin[endnotes.xhtml#en0210]. Before dawn German soldiers had retreated from theSeelow Heights, fifty-five miles from the center of Berlin, leaving no frontline. The Soviet operation to capture Berlin [endnotes.xhtml#en0211] wascolossal, involving 2,500,000 Red Army soldiers, 41,600 guns and mortars, 7,500aircraft, and more than 6,000 tanks.Rumor, panic, and chaos enveloped the city at an unstoppable pace. The majorityof Berliners were now living underground, in cellars and air raid shelters,appearing aboveground only to scavenge for food. Every road out of Berlinleading west was overwhelmed with refugees. Casualties were skyrocketing. To thesouth, a detachment of Hitler Youth fighting near the Buckow Forest becametrapped in a forest fire; most were burned alive. Major General Dr. WalterSchreiber’s makeshift hospital could not keep up with the wounded. During thecourse of the next twelve days the Red Army would fire 1.8 million shells[endnotes.xhtml#en0212] on the city.Hitler’s birthday was also the day Knemeyer and Baumbach would flee Berlin[endnotes.xhtml#en0213] for good. In the morning, Baumbach had received acryptic message from Göring, who instructed him to go meet with SS-BrigadeführerWalter Friedrich Schellenberg, the notorious chief of military intelligence andHimmler’s number-two man. The end was near and everyone seemed to know it, sowhat did Schellenberg want from Baumbach now? Schellenberg told Baumbach that awarrant had been issued for his arrest and that he was scheduled to be takeninto custody during the Führer’s birthday party. Baumbach should leave the cityimmediately, Schellenberg said. Anyone close to Hitler who was arrested thislate in the war—usually suspected of treason—faced a quick execution. This washappening all across Berlin. Had Hitler found out about the Greenland escapeplan?“Schellenberg, whom I had known for years,” Baumbach later explained[endnotes.xhtml#en0214], “was a clever man.” Baumbach interpreted the tip-off tomean only one thing: Schellenberg needed Baumbach alive to help facilitate anescape. “It was known among a core group of SS officers that Himmler had beentrying to use concentration camp inmates as bargaining chips for clemency,through an intermediary [endnotes.xhtml#en0215], the Swedish Red Cross,”Baumbach explained. Of course Himmler would never be granted clemency; Baumbachfigured that Schellenberg and Himmler wanted him alive so he could help themescape somewhere overseas.Baumbach located Knemeyer and the two pilots agreed to flee Berlin immediately.They got in Baumbach’s BMW and headed north to the Travemünde airfield, twohundred miles north of Berlin, on the Baltic Sea. The long-range aircraft theyplanned to use for their escape with Speer [endnotes.xhtml#en0216] sat stockedand fueled on the tarmac. “We were supplied with everything we needed for sixmonths,” Baumbach explained after the war. Knemeyer and Baumbach found manyLuftwaffe officers packing up their belongings, stripping themselves of militaryidentification, and preparing to disappear among civilians. An aide delivered anurgent message to Baumbach. This time it was from Himmler himself. TheReichsführer-SS wanted to see Baumbach immediately. Baumbach was to come toMecklenburg, halfway back to Berlin, where Himmler was staying. Baumbach askedKnemeyer to accompany him.The road leading to Mecklenburg was swamped with refugees. This part of Germanywas one of the only regions still in German control. SS guards herdedconcentration camp prisoners along the roads like cattle in a last-ditch effortto keep them out of the liberators’ hands. The roads were almost impassable, andit took five hours for Baumbach and Knemeyer to drive a hundred miles. When theyfinally arrived at a large country home referred to as the manor of Dobbin[endnotes.xhtml#en0217], Himmler’s SS-guards escorted them inside.“The Reichsführer will receive you now,” a guard said. Knemeyer was told to waitoutside Himmler’s office, while Baumbach was led down a long, narrow corridor,up a winding staircase, and into Himmler’s study. Behind the desk, Himmler satalone. He wore a gray field uniform covered with SS insignia, the death’s head(Totenkopf). The sleeves on Himmler’s uniform were too long, and Baumbach noteda cheap ring on the pinkie finger of his left hand. Himmler sized up the generalof the bombers from behind his signature pince-nez and got to the point.“I’ve sent for you to clear up some Luftwaffe problems,” Himmler said, asrecalled by Baumbach after the war. “The war has entered the final stage andthere are some very important decisions I shall have to take.” Baumbachlistened. “In the very near future [endnotes.xhtml#en0218] I expect to benegotiating with our enemies probably through some neutral country,” Himmlersaid. “I’ve heard that all aircraft suitable for this purpose are under yourcommand.” Baumbach looked out the windows and across the carefully prunedgardens outside, considering his response. Yes, Baumbach told Himmler, he hadaircraft at his disposal, ready at any time. Himmler assumed an even friendliertone, Baumbach recalled, and asked where he could get hold of Baumbach in thecoming days. At the Travemünde airfield, Baumbach said. An aide interrupted toannounce the arrival of Field Marshal Keitel. Baumbach was dismissed.Baumbach made his way back to the sitting room, where Knemeyer waited[endnotes.xhtml#en0219]. By now Knemeyer had figured out whose fancy manorHimmler was living in. The home once belonged to Sir Henry Deterding, theEnglish lord known as the Napoleon of Oil. Next to Knemeyer on a side table weretwo portraits in silver frames. One showed Göring wearing a medieval huntingcostume and holding a large knife. It read, “[T]o my dear Deterding in gratitudefor your noble gift of Rominten Reichs Hunting Lodge,” a detail Knemeyer sharedwith his son decades after the war. The second photograph was a portrait ofHitler. “Sir Henry Deterding,” it read, “in the name of the German people forthe noble donation of a million reichsmarks. Adolf Hitler.”Knemeyer and Baumbach headed outside. The SS officer posted to guard the hallwaygave the two men a stiff salute. He told them that the Reichsführer-SS hadarranged a tray of coffee and sandwiches for them to enjoy before they headedback to Travemünde.The reason that the Greenland escape plan was still on hold[endnotes.xhtml#en0220] was because Speer decided to visit Hitler one last timeat the Führerbunker, compelled by an “overwhelming desire[endnotes.xhtml#en0221] to see him once more.” Driving alone in his private car[endnotes.xhtml#en0222] from Hamburg back into Berlin, Speer was fifty-fivemiles outside the city when the road became impassable, clogged with what Speerlater recalled to be “a ten-thousand vehicle traffic jam.” No one was drivinginto Berlin anymore; everyone was getting out. All lanes in both directions werebeing used for travel west. “Jalopies and limousines, trucks and delivery vans,motorcycles and even Berlin fire trucks” blocked the road. Unable to advance,Speer turned off the road and drove to a divisional staff headquarters, inKyritz, where he learned Soviet forces had encircled Berlin.He also learned that there was only one landing strip inside Berlin thatremained under German control, Gatow airport, on the bank of the Havel River.Speer decided that he would now fly into Berlin. But the nearest aircraft withfuel were parked on the tarmac at the Luftwaffe’s Rechlin test site, nearMecklenburg. Jet fuel was now as rare as hen’s teeth, and the aircraft wasundoubtedly needed for other things. Speer insisted that the commandant atRechlin locate a pilot capable of flying him into Berlin. The commandant atRechlin explained that from Gatow, Speer would never be able to get to theFührerbunker if he traveled by car or by foot; the Russians controlled the waythere. In order to get to the Führerbunker under the New Reich Chancellery,Speer would need a second, smaller aircraft to fly him from Gatow to theBrandenburg Gate. He would need a short takeoff and landing aircraft, or STOL,like the Fieseler Fi 156 Storch (Stork).“Escorted by a squadron of fighter planes, we flew southward at an altitude ofsomewhat over 3,000 feet, a few miles above the battle zone,” remembered Speer.“Visibility was perfect.… All that could be seen were brief, inconspicuousflashes from artillery or exploding shells.” The airfield at Gatow was desertedwhen they landed, with the exception of one of Hitler’s generals who was fleeingBerlin. Speer and his pilot climbed into a waiting Stork and flew the shortdistance over Berlin, landing amid rubble piles [endnotes.xhtml#en0223] directlyin front of the Brandenburg Gate. Speer commandeered an army vehicle and hadhimself driven to the Chancellery, or what was left of it.American bombers had reduced the building to ruins. Speer climbed over a pile ofrubble that had once been a ceiling and walked into what used to be a sittingroom. There, Hitler’s adjunct, Julius Schaub, stood drinking brandy withfriends. Speer called out. Schaub appeared stunned by the sight of Speer. Thecompanions dispersed. Schaub hurried off to inform Hitler that Speer had come tosee him. Speer waited next to a rubble pile. Finally, he heard the words he hadcome to hear: “The Führer is ready to see you now.”Speer walked down into the bunker, where he was met by Martin Bormann, “Hitler’sMephistopheles,” holding court. Bormann wanted to know if Speer had come to tryto get Hitler to fly with him out of Berlin. Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbelsand his wife, Magda, were also in the bunker, plotting the murder-suicide oftheir six children and themselves. Hitler’s girlfriend, Eva Braun, invited Speerinto her quarters to eat cake and drink Moët & Chandon until Hitler was ready tosee him. At 3:00 a.m. Speer was told he could come in. “I was both moved andconfused,” Speer later recalled. “For his part he [Hitler] showed no emotionwhen we confronted one another. His words were as cold as his hand.”“So you’re leaving?” Hitler asked Speer. Then he said, “Good. Auf Wiedersehen.”Good-bye.Speer felt scorned. “No regards to my family, no wishes, no thanks, nofarewell.” For a moment, Speer lost his composure and mumbled something aboutcoming back. But Hitler dismissed his minister of war and weapons, and Speerleft.Six days after Speer’s final meeting with Hitler [endnotes.xhtml#en0224], theU.S. Army liberated Dachau, a concentration camp located twelve miles outsideMunich. It was 7:30 in the morning on April 29 when fifty tanks from the SeventhArmy, Third Battalion of the 157th Infantry Regiment, pulled up to what at firstseemed like an ordinary military post, located adjacent to an SS training camp.The weather was cold and there was a dusting of snow. The post was surrounded[endnotes.xhtml#en0225] by high brick walls, an electrified barbed-wire fence,and a deep ditch. Seven fortified guard towers loomed overhead. The large ironfront gates were closed and locked. A few American soldiers scaled the fence,cut the locks, and opened the gates. The soldiers rushed inside. A briefexchange of rifle fire ensued. Turkish newspaper correspondent Nerin E. Gun,imprisoned in Dachau for his reports on the Warsaw Ghetto, bore witness as someof the SS guards in the watchtowers began shooting at prisoners. But theAmerican soldiers, Gun said, put a quick end to that. “The SS guards promptlycame down the ladders, their hands raised high in surrender.” Other accountsdescribe brutal acts of vengeance inflicted by prisoners against their former SSguards. More gunfire ensued as a second unit, the Forty-fifth ThunderbirdDivision, approached Dachau from the southwest. They discovered fifty openfreight cars abandoned just outside the garrison. Each train car was filled withemaciated bodies. There were several thousand corpses [endnotes.xhtml#en0226] inall.Dachau, the first Nazi concentration camp, had been established by Himmler onMarch 20, 1933. It was originally a place where Communists and other politicalenemies of National Socialism, the ideology of the Nazi Party, were sent. Thename came from the fact that prisoners could be “concentrated[endnotes.xhtml#en0227]” in a group and held under protective custody followingNazi law. Quickly, this changed. Himmler made concentration camps “legallyindependent administrative units [endnotes.xhtml#en0228] outside the penal codeand the ordinary law.” Dachau had served as a training center for SSconcentration camp guards and became a model for how hundreds of otherconcentration camps were to be set up and run. It was also a model for Nazimedical research programs involving doctors who would later become part ofOperation Paperclip.A young U.S. Army lieutenant and physician, Dr. Marcus J. Smith, arrived atDachau early on the morning of April 30, 1945, and in his journal Smith notedhow cold and gloomy [endnotes.xhtml#en0229] the thousand-year-old city was.Before noon it started to hail. Dr. Smith was the sole medical officer attachedto a ten-man displaced persons team sent to the concentration camp the day afterit was liberated. He and his fellow soldiers had instructions to do what theycould to help the 32,000 starved, diseased, and dying camp survivors as theywaited for Red Cross workers to arrive. The newly liberated suffered fromdysentery, tuberculosis, typhus, pneumonia, scabies, and other infectiousdiseases in early, late, and terminal stages, Smith wrote. “Even my callous,death-hardened county-hospital exterior begins to crack.… One of my men weeps[endnotes.xhtml#en0230].”During breaks, Dr. Smith walked around Dachau’s gas chamber to try to make senseof what had gone on there. “I cannot believe this is possible[endnotes.xhtml#en0231] in this enlightened age,” he wrote. “In the rear of thecrematorium is [a] sign, depicting a man riding a monstrous pig. ‘Wash yourhands,’ says the caption. ‘It is your duty to remain clean.’ ”In his spare time, Dr. Smith wandered through the camp. “On one of these walks[endnotes.xhtml#en0232] I enter a one-story building that contains laboratorycounters and storage shelves,” Smith wrote, “almost everything in it has beensmashed: I step over broken benches and drawers, twisted instruments andshattered glassware. In the debris, I am surprised to find a few specimen jarsand bottles intact, filled with preserved human and insect tissues.” Smith askedquestions around the concentration camp to try to learn more. Prisoners told himthat the laboratory had served Nazi doctors as an experimental medical ward, andthat everyone was afraid of it because it was a place “where selected prisoners[were] used as experimental subjects without their consent.”Although it was not yet known by American or British intelligence at the time,what Dr. Marcus Smith had come upon at Dachau was the place where a group ofLuftwaffe doctors had been conducting medical research experiments on humans.This work took place in a freestanding barracks [endnotes.xhtml#en0233],isolated from the others, and was called Experimental Cell Block Five[endnotes.xhtml#en0234]. Many of the Reich’s elite medical doctors[endnotes.xhtml#en0235] passed through the laboratory here. The work that wasperformed in Experimental Cell Block Five was science without conscience: badscience for bad ends. That at least six Nazi medical doctors involved in thisresearch at Dachau would be among the first scientists given contracts by theU.S. Army would become one of the darkest secrets of Operation Paperclip."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter005]THE CAPTURED AND THEIR INTERROGATORS [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter005]The capturing of Nazi scientists would now become a watershed. One by one,across the Reich, Hitler’s scientists were taken into custody and interrogated.The day after Dachau was liberated, 375 miles to the north, Soviet commandersplanned their final assault [endnotes.xhtml#en0236] on the iconic Reichstagbuilding, in Berlin. Sometime around 3:30 [endnotes.xhtml#en0237] in theafternoon, inside the Führerbunker, Hitler fired a bullet into his head. TheRussians were just five hundred meters from the Führerbunker’s emergency exitdoor. Around the corner, under the Reich Chancellery, Red Army soldiers tookover the underground subway tunnels, including the one Major General Dr. WalterSchreiber had been using as a hospital. Soviet film footage—alleged by Schreiberto have been filmed days later as a reenactment—shows Schreiber coming out of acellar with his hands over his head.Up north, Siegfried Knemeyer was captured by the British. Baumbach, Knemeyer,and Speer never escaped to Greenland after all. Shortly after Hitler killedhimself, Baumbach was ordered by Grand Admiral Dönitz to go to the small town ofEutin, forty miles north of the city of Hamburg. Hitler had named Dönitz hissuccessor; Dönitz set up his new government in the naval barracks at Eutinbecause it was one of the few places not yet controlled by the Allied forces.Siegfried Knemeyer hadn’t been invited to join the new inner circle. Baumbachlet him keep the BMW and Knemeyer fled west. On a country road outside Hamburg,Knemeyer spotted a vehicle filled with British soldiers on approach. He knewthat the BMW he was driving would be recognized as belonging to a seniormilitary officer, so he pulled off the highway, ditched the car, and fled onfoot. British soldiers found him hiding under a bridge and arrested him.Knemeyer was taken to a newly liberated concentration camp outside Hamburg,where hundreds of other German officers and Nazi Party officials were held. Hewas a prisoner of war now and was accordingly stripped of his valuables andmilitary insignia. Years later, Knemeyer would share with his son that hemanaged to hide his one remaining meaningful possession in his shoe: a 1,000Swiss franc note given to him by Albert Speer [endnotes.xhtml#en0238].Von Braun and Dornberger were not captured. So confident were they as to theirfuture use by the U.S. Army that they turned themselves in. Since departing fromNordhausen several weeks before, von Braun, Dornberger, and hundreds of othermen from the rocket program had been hiding out in a remote ski village in theBavarian Alps. Their resort, Haus Ingeburg [endnotes.xhtml#en0239], was locatedat an elevation of 3,850 feet along a windy mountain road then called the AdolfHitler Pass (known before and after the war as the Oberjoch Pass). Thanks to theresources of the SS, the scientists had plenty of fine food and drink. There wasa sun terrace and, as von Braun reflected after the war, little for any of themto do but eat, drink, sunbathe, and admire the snow-capped Allgäu Alps. “There Iwas living royally [endnotes.xhtml#en0240] in a ski hotel on a mountainplateau,” von Braun later recalled, “the French below us to the west, and theAmericans to the south. But no one, of course, suspected we were there.”On the night of May 1, 1945, the scientists were listening to the national radioas it played Bruckner’s Symphony No. 7 when, at 10:26, the music was interruptedby a long military drumroll. “Our Führer, Adolf Hitler, fighting to the lastbreath against Bolshevism, fell for Germany this afternoon in his operationalheadquarters in the Reich Chancellery,” the radio announcer declared[endnotes.xhtml#en0241]. The fight was a fabrication. But Hitler’s death spurredWernher von Braun to action. Von Braun approached General Dornberger, suggestingthat they move quickly to make a deal with the Americans[endnotes.xhtml#en0242]. “I agree with you, Wernher,” Dornberger was overheardsaying [endnotes.xhtml#en0243] late that night. “It’s our obligation to put ourbaby into the right hands.”At Haus Ingeburg the rocket scientists had been using a network of German andAustrian intelligence sources [endnotes.xhtml#en0244] to keep track of U.S. Armydevelopments in the area. Von Braun and Dornberger knew that a unit of U.S.soldiers had set up a base at the bottom of the mountain on the Austrian side.The two men agreed it was best to send von Braun’s younger brother, Magnus, downthe mountain to try to make a deal with the Americans. Magnus was trustworthy.He understood what could be said about the V-2 and what could never be said.Magnus von Braun had been in charge of overseeing slave labor production of thegyroscopes that each rocket required, and he understood why the subject of slavelabor was to be avoided at all cost. He also was the best English speaker in thegroup.On the morning of May 2, Magnus von Braun climbed onto a bicycle and beganpedaling down the steep mountain pass through the bright alpine sunshine.Shortly before lunchtime he came upon an American soldier manning a post alongthe road. It was Private First Class Fred Schneikert, the son of a Wisconsinfarmer, now a soldier with the Forty-fourth Infantry Division of the U.S. Army.When Private Schneikert spotted [endnotes.xhtml#en0245] a lone German on abicycle, he ordered the man to drop the bike and raise both hands. Magnus vonBraun complied. In broken English, he tried explaining to the American soldierthat his brother wanted to make a deal with regard to the V-2 rocket. “Itsounded like he wanted to ‘sell’ his brother to the Americans,” PrivateSchneikert recalled.Private Schneikert escorted Magnus von Braun farther down the mountain so hecould speak with a superior at the Forty-fourth Division’s U.S. CounterIntelligence Corps (CIC) headquarters, located in Reutte, just over the borderin Austria. There, CIC contacted SHAEF headquarters in Versailles, whichcontacted a CIOS team. The CIOS Black List [endnotes.xhtml#en0246] for rocketresearch included one thousand names of scientists and engineers slated forinterrogation. Wernher von Braun was at the top of that list.It was May 2, 1945, and although Hitler was dead, the German Reich had not yetsurrendered. Allies feared members of a fanatical resistance group, theWerewolves, were lurking in Bavaria, planning a final attack. Thinking that thevon Braun brother could be part of a trap, the Counter Intelligence Corps toldMagnus to go tell his brother Wernher to come down and surrender himself. Magnusheaded back up the mountain with the news.At the Haus Ingeburg ski resort, Wernher von Braun and General Dornberger hadselected a small group to join their deal-making team. They were Magnus vonBraun; General Dornberger’s chief of staff, Herbert Axster; the enginespecialist Hans Lindenberg; and the two engineers who had hidden the V-2documents inside the Dörnten mine, Dieter Huzel and Bernhard Tessmann. The menstuffed their personal belongings into three gray passenger vans and headed downthe Adolf Hitler Pass. Heavy snow gave way to driving rain.When the group of seven arrived in Reutte later that night, they found FirstLieutenant Charles Stewart doing paperwork by candlelight. Their welcome was, bymany accounts, warm. “I did not expect to be kicked in the teeth,” von Brauntold an American reporter years later. “The V-2 was something we had and youdidn’t have. Naturally, you wanted to know all about it.” The rocket scientistswere served fresh eggs, coffee, and bread with real butter. Fancy, but not quiteas good as what was being provided at Haus Ingeburg. The scientists were givenprivate rooms to sleep in, with pillows and clean sheets. In the morning, thepress had arrived. The “capture” of the scientists and engineers behind thedeadly V-2 was a big story for the international press. The group posed forphotographs, and in the pictures they are all smiles. Von Braun boasted abouthaving invented the V-2. He was “its founder and guiding spirit,” von Brauninsisted. Everyone else was secondary to him.Some members of the Forty-fourth Division Counter Intelligence Corps found vonBraun’s hubris appalling. “He posed for endless pictures with individual GIs, inwhich he beamed, shook hands, pointed inquiringly at medals and otherwiseconducted himself as a celebrity rather than a prisoner,” noted one member,“treat[ing] our soldiers with the affable condescension of a visitingcongressman.” Second Lieutenant Walter Jessel was the American intelligenceofficer originally in charge of interrogating von Braun. His first and mostlasting impression was the lack of remorse. “There is recognition of Germany’sdefeat, but none whatsoever of Germany’s guilt and responsibility.” So confidentwere von Braun and Dornberger about their value to the U.S. Army, they demandedto see General Eisenhower, whom they called “Ike.”Another observer noted, “If we hadn’t caught the biggest scientist in the ThirdReich, we had certainly caught the biggest liar [endnotes.xhtml#en0247].”Hitler’s chemists—sought after as they were—were nowhere to be found. It wasearly May, and the Seventh Army was in control of the beautiful old city ofHeidelberg, located on the Neckar River. Twenty-five agents[endnotes.xhtml#en0248] attached to the U.S. military government’s CartelsDivision, including clerks with OSS and the Foreign Economic Division, haddescended on the town looking for board members from IG Farben. In addition tobeing wanted for war crimes, the IG Farben board of directors was beinginvestigated for international money laundering schemes. A number ofhigh-ranking Farben executives were known to have houses in Heidelberg, but todate no one had been able to find Hermann Schmitz, the company’s powerful andsecretive CEO. Schmitz was also a director of the Deutsche Reichsbank, theGerman central bank, and director of the Bank for International Settlements inGeneva. He was believed to be the wealthiest banker in all of Germany[endnotes.xhtml#en0249]. The reason no one had been able to locate HermannSchmitz was not because he was hiding out or had fled but because officers weregoing around Heidelberg looking for “Schmitz Castle.” Despite the vast wealth hehad accumulated during the war, Hermann Schmitz was actually a miser. He livedin a modest, if not ugly, little house. “No one would associate the legend ofSchmitz [endnotes.xhtml#en0250] with the house he lived in,” Nurembergprosecutor Josiah DuBois recalled after the war.Working on a tip, and as part of a door-to-door search for suspected warcriminals, a group of enlisted soldiers knocked on the door of a “stucco pillboxof a house” overlooking the city where a short man with a red face and a thickneck answered the door. Behind him, on a placard nailed to the wall, it waswritten that God was the head of this house. Schmitz had dark eyes and a goateeand was accompanied by his wife, described by soldiers as “a dumpy Frau[endnotes.xhtml#en0251] in a crisp gingham dress.” Frau Schmitz offered thesoldiers coffee, but Schmitz intervened and told her no. Schmitz said he had nointerest in answering the questions of the enlisted men whom he consideredbeneath him. If an officer came to speak with him, Schmitz said he might havesomething to say.The men conducted a cursory search of the house. Schmitz’s office was plainlyfurnished and contained nothing expensive or of any obvious value. Searchingthough his desk, however, the soldiers learned that Schmitz had friends in highplaces. They found a collection of birthday telegrams sent from Hitler andGöring, both of whom addressed Schmitz as “Justizrat,” Doctor of Laws.“Doctor of Laws Schmitz [endnotes.xhtml#en0252],” the soldiers asked, mockinghim. “How much money do you have in this house, and where is it?”Schmitz declined to say, and the soldiers were only able to locate a small stashof about 15,000 reichsmarks, or about half the annual salary of a field marshal.So they left, letting Schmitz know that they would return the following day. Onthe second day, Schmitz let the soldiers back in. This time the soldiers foundan air raid shelter behind the house, where Schmitz had hidden a trunk filledwith IG Farben documents. There was still not enough evidence to justifyarresting [endnotes.xhtml#en0253] Schmitz. It would be a few more days until anincredible discovery was made.When CIOS team leader Major Tilley learned that Hermann Schmitz had beenlocated, he rushed to Heidelberg. Tilley and Tarr had been leading the CIOSchemical weapons mission across Germany. Ever since they had discovered thetabun nerve agent cache hidden in the forest outside the Robbers’ Lair, they hadbeen looking for Farben executives. Now they had the man at the top.If anyone could skillfully interrogate Hermann Schmitz, Major Tilley could[endnotes.xhtml#en0254]. Not only did he speak fluent German, but he was deeplyconversant on the subject of chemical warfare. In Heidelberg, Tilley wentdirectly to Schmitz’s house. He suggested that the two men discuss a few thingsin Herr Schmitz’s private study. Schmitz said that would be fine.Tilley asked the Farben CEO a series of banal questions, all the while tappingon the walls of Schmitz’s study. Slowly, Tilley made his way around the roomthis way, listening for any inconsistencies in the way the walls were built.Schmitz grew increasingly uncomfortable. Finally he began to cry. Tilley hadfound what he was looking for: a secret safe buried in Schmitz’s office wall[endnotes.xhtml#en0255].Hermann Schmitz was one of the wealthiest bankers in Germany and one of the mostimportant players in the economics of the Third Reich. What secret was containedin his safe? Major Tilley instructed Schmitz to open it. Inside, lying flat, wasa photo album. “The photographs were in a wooden inlaid cover dedicated toHermann Schmitz on his twenty-fifth jubilee, possibly as a Farben director,”Tilley explained in a CIOS intelligence report. Tilley lifted out the photoalbum from its hiding place, flipped open the cover, and began reviewing thepictures. On here [part001.xhtml#page-1] of the scrapbook, the word “Auschwitz”was written. Tilley’s eyes scanned over a picture of a street in a Polishvillage. Next to the photograph was a cartoonish drawing [endnotes.xhtml#en0256]“depicting individuals who had once been part of the Jewish population who livedthere, portrayed in a manner that was not flattering to them,” Tilley explained.The caption underneath the cartoon read: “The Old Auschwitz. As it Was.Auschwitz in 1940.”At this point, Tilley wrote in his CIOS report, he was surprised at how “highlyemotional” Schmitz became. What Tilley did not yet know [endnotes.xhtml#en0257]was that he was looking at Schmitz’s secret photo album that chronicled thebuilding history of Farben’s labor concentration camp, IG Auschwitz, from thevery start. In May of 1945, almost no one, including Major Tilley, had any ideawhat really had happened at Auschwitz—that at least 1.1 million people had beenexterminated there. The facts about the camp had not yet come to light. OnJanuary 27, 1945, Soviet troops liberated Auschwitz, and Red Army photographerstook film footage and photographs of the atrocities they discovered there. Butthat information had not yet been shared openly with the rest of the world. Ashort report about the extermination camp had appeared in Stalinskoe Znamya, theRed Army’s newspaper, on January 28, 1945. Stalin was waiting[endnotes.xhtml#en0258] to release the bulk of information until after Germanysurrendered. What was clear to Major Tilley was that this photo album wasimportant to Schmitz, and that he wanted it to remain hidden. Why, exactly,Major Tilley had no idea [endnotes.xhtml#en0259].As CIOS team leader, Major Tilley was on a hunt for Farben chemists who haddeveloped nerve gas. Hermann Schmitz, while important to Farben in the biggerpicture, was not a chemist. He claimed to have no idea where the Farben chemistshad gone. The scrapbook was taken into evidence, and Tilley moved on in hissearch. Meanwhile, in southern Germany, in an Austrian border town calledGendorf, the man Major Tilley was really looking for—Dr. Otto Ambros—had justbeen located by U.S. Army soldiers. The soldiers had no idea who Ambros reallywas.When American soldiers rolled into the town of Gendorf, about sixty milessoutheast of Munich, they noticed one man in particular because he stood outlike a sore thumb. This first encounter with Ambros, later recounted at theNuremberg trials [endnotes.xhtml#en0260], stuck out in soldiers’ minds becauseAmbros had been dressed in a fancy suit to greet the victors. The man hardlylooked like he’d been through a war. The soldiers asked the man his rank andserial number.“My name is Otto Ambros,” he said, smiling. He added that he was not a militaryman but “a plain chemist [endnotes.xhtml#en0261].”Was he German, the soldiers asked?“Yes, I am German,” Ambros replied, and made a joke. He said that he had so manyFrench friends he could almost be considered a Frenchman. In fact, his true homewas in Ludwigshafen, on the border with France. He told the soldiers that thereason he was here in southern Bavaria was because he was the director of alarge business concern called IG Farben. The company had a detergent factoryhere in Gendorf, Ambros explained. As a Farben board member he’d been asked tooversee production. German society might be experiencing a collapse, he told thesoldiers, but everyone needed to stay clean.The soldiers asked to be taken to the detergent factory. Inside, they inspectedhuge vats of soap and other cleaning products. Work at the factory appeared tohave been uninterrupted by the war. Ambros took the soldiers to his office,where someone had taped a rainbow of color spectrum cards to the wall. Inaddition to cleaning products, the facility made lacquers, Ambros explained. Thesoldiers looked around, thanked Ambros for the tour, and asked him not to leavetown.I have “no reason to flee,” said Ambros. The soldiers noted how much he smiled.Over the next few days, more soldiers arrived in Gendorf. These filthy,grime-covered American GIs were delighted when the so-called plain chemistoffered them free bars of soap. Some of the soldiers hadn’t washed in more thana month. The chemist’s generosity did not stop there. Otto Ambros gave thesoldiers powerful cleaning solvents so that they could wash their mud-coveredarmored tanks.Soldiers interviewed Otto Ambros a second time. This time, Ambros voluntarilyoffered up character witnesses. Working at the Farben factory in Gendorf wereskinny men with shaved heads. Ambros said they were war refugees and that theycould vouch for his kindness as a boss. They were from Poland, just across theborder to the east. Ambros told the soldiers that he had personally broughtthese poor workers here to Gendorf. He’d handpicked the men and trained them howto work hard. This way, when the refugees went home, they would have skills thatcould help them earn a living, Ambros explained. The skinny refugees were quietand said nothing to dispute the plain chemist’s claims. Some of them even helpedthe American soldiers wash their tanks.Otto Ambros was a talkative man. He regaled the Americans with stories about thejoys of chemistry. For example, did the soldiers realize what a miracle it wasthat man could make one hundred wonders from a single chemical compound likeethylene oxide? Or how amazing rubber was? Ambros told the soldiers that he hadbeen to Ceylon, where the rubber plant grows. Rubber had so much in common withman, Ambros said. He was a rubber expert, so he knew this to be fact. Rubber wascivilized. Neat and perfect if kept clean. Ambros told the soldiers that arubber factory and a man must always be very clean. A single flake of dust ordirt in a vat of liquid rubber could mean a blowout on the autobahn one day. IGFarben had synthetic rubber factories and, like natural rubber, the laboratoriesand factories must always be kept perfectly clean. Ambros talked a lot, but hedid not mention anything about the rubber factory he had built and managed atAuschwitz. The soldiers thanked him for his generosity with the soap and thecleaning agents. Before they left, they reminded Ambros again that it wasimportant he not leave town. He was technically under house arrest.When American officials of higher rank finally arrived in Gendorf a few dayslater, they had more specific questions for Ambros. Why was part of the Farbendetergent factory built underground? It would take months for CIOS investigatorsto learn that the factory here in Gendorf produced chemical weapons during thewar—and that, after Ambros had fled Auschwitz in late January 1945, he and hisdeputy, Jürgen von Klenck, had come to Gendorf to destroy evidence, hidedocuments, and disguise the factory so that it appeared to produce onlydetergents and soap.In Munich, on May 17, 1945, U.S. soldiers at a checkpoint were conducting aroutine identification request when a well-dressed man—134 pounds, five footnine, with dark black hair, hazel eyes, and a pronounced dueling scar on theleft side of his face between his nose and his upper lip—presented a Germanpassport bearing the name Professor Doctor Friedrich Ludwig Kurt Blome.Dr. Blome’s name triggered an alert [endnotes.xhtml#en0262]: “Immediate arrest.1st Priority.” Samuel Goudsmit and the entire team of biological warfare expertswith Operation Alsos had been on the hunt for Dr. Blome. Agent Arnold Vyth, withthe army’s Counter Intelligence Corps, made the arrest. Agent Vyth completed thenecessary paperwork while the prisoner was processed. Dr. Blome was sent to theTwelfth Army Group Interrogation Center for questioning. Several days later, adocument arrived via teletype from the Office of Strategic Services (OSS),America’s wartime espionage agency and the precursor to the CIA. They, too, hadbeen searching for Dr. Blome [endnotes.xhtml#en0263].The War Crimes Office had considerable information about Dr. Kurt Blome. He wasdeputy surgeon general of the Third Reich and vice president of the Reich’sPhysicians’ League, Reichsärztekammer. He was believed to have reported directlyto Göring and maybe even to Himmler, or to both. Blome had been named head ofReich cancer research in 1942. Alsos and OSS presumed that this was a cover namefor biological weapons work. Blome was a dedicated and proud Nazi[endnotes.xhtml#en0264]. His book [endnotes.xhtml#en0265] Arzt im Kampf (Doctorin Battle) compared a doctor’s struggle with the struggle of the Third Reich.Soldiers, officers, and doctors weren’t all that different, each constantly inbattle against invading forces and disease.Investigators were trying to piece together [endnotes.xhtml#en0266] thelabyrinthine medical hierarchy of the Third Reich so as to understand who was incharge of what organization. Particularly interesting to the interrogators wasthe fact that Dr. Kurt Blome had been part of a top-tier group of Nazi doctorswho focused on “hygiene.” This word connoted disease control but was alsobelieved to have been used by the Reich as a euphemism for ethnic cleansing andextermination of Jews. Alsos was in possession of correspondence between Blomeand Himmler that discussed giving certain groups of sick individuals—in thiscase tubercular Poles—“special treatment [endnotes.xhtml#en0267]”(Sonderbehandlung). What exactly did special treatment mean? At the time ofBlome’s capture and interrogation, Allied intelligence agencies believed thatthere was only one physician higher than Blome in the hierarchy of the ReichHygiene Committee [endnotes.xhtml#en0268], and that was the notorious ReichHealth Leader (Reichsgesundheitsführer), Leonardo Conti.Dr. Blome spoke fluent English with his first army interrogator. He describedhimself as a “good Nazi”—obedient—and promised that he was willing to cooperatewith the Allies. At first his interrogators were thrilled by the prospect oflearning more about Reich medicine from such a big fish as Dr. Blome.Why was he cooperating? Blome was asked.“[I] can not approve [endnotes.xhtml#en0269] of the way new advances in medicalscience have been used for atrocities,” declared Dr. Blome.What kind of atrocities? Blome’s investigator wanted to know.Blome stated that in his capacity as deputy surgeon general of the Reich he had“observe[d] new scientific studies and experiments which led to later atrocitiese.g. mass sterilization, gassing of Jews [endnotes.xhtml#en0270].” It was anastonishing admission. Until Dr. Blome gave up this information so freely, nophysician in the inner circle had admitted to having known about such wide-scaleatrocities as mass murder and sterilization programs. That Blome was willing totalk was extremely promising news. Blome was “cooperative and intelligent,”noted his interrogator. Most important, he was “willing to supply information.”But the U.S. investigators’ excitement did not last long. By his nextinterrogation, Dr. Kurt Blome had shut down entirely. He told his interrogatingofficer, Major E. W. B. Gill, that he had only ever been an administrator forthe Reich; that he did nothing “hands-on.” Major Gill pressed Blome forinformation [endnotes.xhtml#en0271] about his direct superior, Dr. LeonardoConti. Blome said he knew nothing about Conti’s job.“When I pointed out that the deputy must presumably know something about hischief’s job,” Major Gill wrote in his report, “he said the organization wasextremely complicated and really he would like to draw me a diagram on it.” Gilllost his temper. “I told Blome I didn’t want his dammed diagrams, but an answerto a simple question. How did he take Conti’s place if he [Conti] were absent orill if he knew nothing of the job?”Blome repeated his position. That it was all too complicated to explain to a manlike Major Gill. Outraged by the sidestepping, Gill kept at it. But by the endof Blome’s Alsos interrogation, Major Gill had been unable to get even a scrapof new information from Blome. He claimed never to have heard of the majority ofthe names of fellow doctors that Major Gill asked him about. Instead, Blomeinsisted that he knew nothing about the medical chain of command inside theThird Reich or the SS, despite the fact that he had personally met with Himmlerfive times since 1943. Gill asked how Blome, a “cancer expert,” had been put incharge of the Reich’s bioweapons program, a subject he claimed to know verylittle about. Blome said he had no answer for that.“On my suggestion that a most important branch of war research would not beassigned to a complete ignoramus he, after endless explanations of thecomplexity of the German world, finally said it must have been because, as anundergraduate, he wrote on BW [biological weapons] as his thesis for adoctorate.” Major Gill felt for certain that Dr. Blome was lying. But there wasnothing he could do except present Blome with information and evidence thatAlsos had compiled about him since they had seized Dr. Eugen Haagen’s apartmentsix months before.Gill told Blome that in a series of interrogations with sixteen Reich doctorsalso involved in bioweapons-related research, Alsos officers had learned aboutmany horrific medical crimes. Gill explained that Alsos had documents that tiedBlome to the crimes. For example, Alsos had found letters inside the apartmentof Dr. Eugen Haagen that linked Dr. Blome to Dr. Haagen and also to an SScolleague named Dr. August Hirt. These letters made clear that someone wasproviding Reich doctors with human guinea pigs. Who exactly was in charge ofthis program, Gill asked Blome? Gill needed a name.Blome denied having any idea [endnotes.xhtml#en0272] what Gill was referring to.Major Gill told Blome he had a letter that implicated Blome. In another letter,Gill said, Dr. Blome had instructed Dr. Hirt to conduct research on “the effectof mustard gas on living organisms.” The phrase “living organisms” was a codename for people, wasn’t it? Gill asked Blome. Dr. Blome kept stonewalling. “Onthe whole subject of SS research, his attitude was always that it was so secretthat not even [the] Reich chief medical advisor knew anything about it,” MajorGill wrote in his report.Gill was convinced that Dr. Kurt Blome was lying. He felt certain that DoctorsHaagen, Hirt, Blome, and the SS were connected to medical research on prisonersat concentration camps.“This interrogation was extremely unproductive,” a frustrated Major Gillsummarized in his report. “Although I do not wish to be definitive my firstimpression is that Blome is a liar and a medical charlatan.”Down south in the Bavarian Alps, while the V-2 rocket scientists angled for adeal with the U.S. Army, Georg Rickhey, former general manager of theMittelwerk, tried to blend in. Rickhey had taken a job ninety miles fromNordhausen, running operations in a salt mine. For several weeks, no one waslooking for him. Then Colonel Peter Beasley, of the U.S. Strategic BombingSurvey (USSBS), arrived in the area on a mission from the War Department.Beasley’s job was to locate the engineers who had built the fortifiedunderground weapons facilities in the Harz. These bombproof bunkers wereextraordinary engineering feats, and the USSBS was impressed with how so many ofthem had withstood relentless Allied air bombing campaigns. The rocket facilityat Nordhausen was of particular importance to USSBS officers, and ColonelBeasley set up shop in an abandoned barracks just north of the former Mittelwerkfactory, in a town called Ilfeld, to investigate. As circumstance would have it,the barracks he chose to occupy was the building in which the former office ofGeorg Rickhey was located. From documents and equipment left behind, ColonelBeasley learned that Rickhey possessed extremely valuable information about howthe tunnel factory had been built. Beasley asked around [endnotes.xhtml#en0273],but none of the locals claimed to know where Rickhey had gone.“I made daily visits to the jails [endnotes.xhtml#en0274] in the small towns tosee if I could locate anyone who might interest me,” Beasley wrote in a report.Eventually he found a man who gave him a tip. Georg Rickhey was runningoperations at a salt mine in the Black Forest, the man said. Colonel Beasleysent two officers into the field to track Rickhey down.Meanwhile, Beasley and his team followed another lead. “In Blankenburg,” Beasleywrote, “we found a school building with some miscellaneous papers bearing theSpeer Ministry insignia.” From these documents Beasley learned that GeorgRickhey was the liaison between the Mittelwerk and the Ministry of Armaments.When Beasley’s two officers returned with Georg Rickhey in custody, Beasleyplaced Rickhey under arrest and began to interrogate him. He was “a nervouslittle man [endnotes.xhtml#en0275] who smoked incessantly and always brought theconversation back to scientific or technical matters,” Beasley recalled afterthe war, but in the end he “was a most profitable catch.”“I’ve got a job for you,” Beasley told Rickhey. “I want you to begin right nowwriting out a full description of yourself and all the activities of the V-2factory, and what your people were working on.” Rickhey complied. When the taskwas complete, Beasley told the former general manager of the Mittelwerk, “[W]eaccept you [endnotes.xhtml#en0276] as an official of the German Government; wehave patience and time and lots of people—you have lost the war and so as far asI am concerned you are a man who knows a lot about rockets. As an Americanofficer, I want my country to have full possession of all your knowledge. To mysuperiors, I shall recommend that you be taken to the United States.”Rickhey embraced this news with open arms. He told Beasley that he was ascientist and only wanted to work in pleasant surroundings, like the UnitedStates. He agreed to tell Beasley where some important records had been hidden.Rickhey took Colonel Beasley to a cave several miles away. There, forty-twoboxes of worksheets, engineering tables, and blueprints relating to Nordhausenand the V-2 had been stashed. This was certainly not Wernher von Braun’sdocuments stash, but for the USSBS, it was more than they possessed up to thispoint. Now that he was in possession of a huge trove of documents, ColonelBeasley realized that he needed to have them translated by someone withtechnical expertise. He had promised Rickhey [endnotes.xhtml#en0277] arecommendation for a job in the United States, but first he needed Rickhey tocome with him to London to translate and analyze these documents for him.Albert Speer, one of the most wanted Nazi war criminals in the world, wasfinally captured on the morning of May 23, 1945. He was standing in one of thebathrooms of a friend’s castle, Schloss Glücksburg, near Flensburg, in northGermany. Hitler’s successor, Grand Admiral Dönitz, had by now moved his newgovernment from Eutin to Flensburg, which was located just a few miles from theDanish border. Speer, a Dönitz cabinet member, had been making the dailysix-mile drive [endnotes.xhtml#en0278] from Schloss Glücksburg to the newgovernment’s headquarters. The way Speer told the story of his capture, he hadbeen shaving [endnotes.xhtml#en0279] when he heard the sounds of heavy footstepsand loud orders being delivered in English. Sensing that the end of his freedomhad arrived, Speer opened the bathroom door a little, his face half-covered inshaving cream, and saw the British soldiers standing there.“Are you Albert Speer, sir?” a British sergeant asked.“Yes, I am Speer,” he answered in English.“Sir, you are my prisoner,” the sergeant said.Speer got dressed and packed a bag. Outside on the castle lawn, a unit ofBritish soldiers with antitank guns [endnotes.xhtml#en0280] had surroundedSchloss Glücksburg. Speer was arrested and taken away [endnotes.xhtml#en0281].By the time the British arrested Speer, American officials had known[endnotes.xhtml#en0282] for nearly two weeks where he had been hiding out.Speer’s previous eleven days in the castle had been spent in discussions withAmerican officials [endnotes.xhtml#en0283] with the U.S. Strategic BombingSurvey (USSBS). The head of that organization, Paul Nitze, had managed to be thefirst person in an international manhunt to track down Albert Speer. Nitzeconsidered Speer his most desired intelligence target, and on May 12, 1945, heboarded his DC-3 from where he was stationed in London and headed to CastleGlücksburg “before you could say ‘knife,’ ” Nitze recalled after the war.Because Flensburg was in the British zone of control, it was the British whoneeded to arrest Albert Speer. Until then, Nitze, an American, felt at libertyto get as much information from Speer as he could. “We were looking forabsolutely vital information and knowledge and he was literally the only personin Germany who was in a position to provide it,” Nitze recalled years later[endnotes.xhtml#en0284].Specifically, Nitze’s organization wanted to know which Allied bombing campaignshad proved the most devastating against Germany during the war. America wasstill at war with the Japanese, and the USSBS believed Speer could provide themwith information that might help America defeat them. Nitze was joined at thecastle by two of his colleagues, George Ball and John Kenneth Galbraith. For thenext eleven days the three men questioned Speer. From inside an elegant sittingroom wallpapered in red and gold brocade, the men discussed which Allied bombingcampaigns had done the most damage to Nazi Germany and which had had the leasteffect. Of particular interest to Nitze, Ball, and Galbraith was how the Reich’sarmaments industry had been able to hold out for so long. Speer explained thatat his initiative the majority of the Reich’s weapons facilities had been movedunderground. These weapons complexes had proved to be impervious to even theheaviest bombing campaigns. They were engineering triumphs, their constructionspearheaded largely by Franz Dorsch and Speer’s deputy Walter Schieber, Speersaid. Speer’s secretary, Annemarie Kempf, took notes. The only interruption waswhen the cook for the castle summoned everyone for lunch.Speer did not mention that his deputy, SS-Brigadeführer Schieber, a chemist,also worked with Speer in chemical weapons production; that would be opening upa can of war crimes–related worms. The Americans were not interested in pressingSpeer about his involvement in war crimes, and Speer was certainly not offeringup any incriminating evidence against himself. Mostly he boasted about hisministry’s feats. George Ball recalled that only once, maybe twice, during theUSSBS questioning was Speer asked about the concentration camps. “I asked himwhat he knew about the extermination of the Jews. He said he couldn’t comment[endnotes.xhtml#en0285] because he hadn’t known about it, but he added that itwas a mistake not to have found out,” Ball told Speer’s biographer, GittaSereny, after the war.John Kenneth Galbraith was the only one of the three men from the U.S. StrategicBombing Survey who had toured a liberated concentration camp before interviewingSpeer. Galbraith had seen the atrocities at Dachau and Buchenwald. He explained,“One was just beginning to hear rumors about Auschwitz.” Did Galbraith believethat Speer did not know about the extermination of the Jews? “No, I don’tbelieve he didn’t know,” Galbraith told Sereny. “Certainly he knew about all theslave laborers. I remember him saying to us, ‘You should hang Saukel’ ”—Speer’sdeputy in charge of slave labor—“and then a few weeks later, Saukel said to us,‘You should hang Speer.’ Nice people, weren’t they?”After eleven days of discussions with the Americans, the British located andarrested Speer. They drove him the six miles to Flensburg, where the remainingmembers of Hitler’s government were also arrested. Under an escort of more thanthirty armored vehicles, the prisoners were driven to waiting aircraft. There,in a field of grass, the men of Hitler’s inner circle were loaded onto twoairplanes and flown to a Top Secret interrogation center code-named Ashcan.That same afternoon, one hundred miles south of Flensburg, at the Thirty-firstCivilian Interrogation Camp near Lüneburg, a former Wehrmacht sergeant wasmaking a lot of noise. The officer in charge of Camp 31, Captain ThomasSelvester, found the man’s behavior odd. Wehrmacht soldiers who were prisonersrarely did anything to draw attention to themselves. Captain Selvester sent forthe agitated man, whom he described as a short, “ill-looking” person in civilianclothing with a black eye patch over his left eye. Face-to-face with CaptainSelvester, the small, ugly man ceremoniously pulled off the eye patch, revealinga pale, unshaven face. The man then produced a pair of horn-rimmed glasses fromhis pocket and put them on his face.“Heinrich Himmler,” the prisoner announced [endnotes.xhtml#en0286] in a quietvoice.With the glasses on, Captain Selvester recognized Heinrich Himmler at once.Before him stood a man many considered the most powerful man in the Third Reichafter Hitler. Himmler was Reichsführer-SS and chief of the German police,commander of the Reserve Army of the Wehrmacht, and Reich minister of theinterior. That face. The cleft chin and the sinister, smiling eyes. Ever since adrawing of Himmler had appeared on the cover of Time magazine, on October 11,1943—portraying the “Police Chief of Nazi Europe [endnotes.xhtml#en0287]” infront of a mountain of corpses—he had become synonymous with evil. Now that thelittle round glasses were on, Selvester was certain this person was indeedHeinrich Himmler. Still, Captain Selvester followed protocol and asked forsignature verification. When Himmler had been captured days before he’dpresented forged military papers that identified him [endnotes.xhtml#en0288] asa Wehrmacht sergeant named Heinrich Hitzinger.The signature matched, and Captain Selvester sent for the most seniorinterrogator in Camp 31, a Captain named Smith. Once Smith arrived, Selvesterordered Himmler searched again. This time British soldiers found two vials ofpoison hidden in Himmler’s clothes. It was medicine to treat stomach cramps,Himmler said. Captain Smith ordered a second physical exam of the prisoner, andthe camp’s doctor, Captain Clement Wells, spotted a blue-tipped object[endnotes.xhtml#en0289]—hidden in the back of Himmler’s mouth. When Dr. Wellstried to remove it, Himmler jerked his head back [endnotes.xhtml#en0290] and bitdown. The vial contained poison. Within seconds, the prisoner collapsed. NowHeinrich Himmler was dead. An assistant to Dr. Wells noted in his diary, “[T]hisevil thing [endnotes.xhtml#en0291] breathed its last breath at 23:14.”The war in Europe was over. Germans called it die Stunde Null, zero hour. Citieslay in ruins. Allied bombing had destroyed more than 1.8 million German homes.Of the 18.2 million [endnotes.xhtml#en0292] men who had served in the Germanarmy, navy, Luftwaffe, and the Waffen-SS, a total of 5.3 million had beenkilled. Sixty-one countries had been drawn into a war Germany started. Some 50million people [endnotes.xhtml#en0293] were dead. The Third Reich was no more.Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Hitler were dead. Albert Speer was in custody. Sowere Siegfried Knemeyer and Dr. Kurt Blome. Otto Ambros was under house arrestin Gendorf, with no one in CIOS or Alsos yet having figured out who he reallywas. Wernher von Braun, Walter Dornberger, and Arthur Rudolph were in custody,working toward contracts with the U.S. Army. Georg Rickhey had a job in London,translating documents for the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey.The future of war and weapons hung in the balance. What would happen to the Naziscientists? Who would be hired and who would be hanged? In May 1945 there was noofficial policy regarding what to do with any of them. “The question who is aNazi [endnotes.xhtml#en0294] is often a dark riddle,” an officer with the ThirdArmy, G-5, wrote in a report sent to SHAEF headquarters in May. “The questionwhat is a Nazi is also not easy to answer.”Over the next few months, critical decisions about what to do with Hitler’sformer scientists and engineers would be made, almost always based on anindividual military organization’s needs and justified by perceived threats.Official policy would follow, one version for the public and another for theJoint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).

Farren, British aviation expert with theRoyal Aircraft Establishment"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter006]HARNESSING THE CHARIOT OF DESTRUCTION [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter006]What to do about Hitler’s former scientists? The fighting had stopped, and theAllied forces were transitioning from a conquering army to an occupying force.Germany was to be disarmed, demilitarized, and denazified so its ability to makewar would be reduced to nil, and science and technology were at the very heartof the matter. “Clearly German science must be curbed [endnotes.xhtml#en0296],”noted Army Air Forces Lieutenant Colonel John O’Mara, in the CIOS report heauthored on the rise of the Luftwaffe. “But how?” World War I had ended with apeace treaty that, among other restrictions, “sought to prevent the rise ofGerman Air Power by forbidding powered flight. The result,” explained O’Mara,“was as ludicrous as it was tragic.” By the time Germany started World War II,its air force was the most powerful in the world. The mistake could not berepeated, and the U.S. procedural guidelines for an occupied Germany, containedin a directive known as JCS (Joint Chiefs of Staff) 1076[endnotes.xhtml#en0297], promised to nullify Germany’s appetite for war. Allmilitary research was to cease. Scientists were rounded up and taken todetention centers for extensive questioning.Across the former Reich, SHAEF had set up internment centers where more thanfifteen hundred scientists were now being held [endnotes.xhtml#en0298] separatefrom other German prisoners of war. The U.S. Army had approximately 500scientists in custody in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, in the Bavarian Alps, includingthe von Braun and Dornberger group; there were 444 persons of interest detainedin Heidenheim, north of Munich; 200 were in Zell am See, in Austria; 30 kept atChâteau du Grande Chesnay, in France. The U.S. Navy had 200 scientists andengineers at a holding facility in Kochel, Germany, including many wind tunnelexperts. The Army Air Forces had 150 Luftwaffe engineers and technicians in BadKissingen, Germany, a majority of whom had been rounded up by Colonel DonaldPutt. CIOS had 50 scientists, including Werner Osenberg, in Versailles. Butthere was no clear policy regarding what lay ahead for the scientists,engineers, and technicians in Allied custody, and General Eisenhower soughtclarification [endnotes.xhtml#en0299] on the issue. From Supreme HeadquartersAllied Expeditionary Force in France, he sent a cable to the War DepartmentGeneral Staff in Washington, D.C., asking for specific direction aboutlonger-term goals. “Restraint and control of future German scientific andtechnical investigations are clearly indicated,” General Eisenhower wrote, “butthis headquarters is without guidance on the matter and is in no position toformulate long-term policy.” Were these men going to be detained indefinitely?Interrogated and released?The War Department responded to Eisenhower’s cable by letting him know his querywas considered a “matter of urgency.” [endnotes.xhtml#en0300] Tentativeresponsibility was assigned to the Captured Personnel and Materiel Branch of theMilitary Intelligence Service, Europe. Now that group was in charge ofoverseeing the scientists’ basic needs, including living quarters, food, and insome cases pay. But it would be another two weeks before the War Departmentwould get back to General Eisenhower with any kind of a statement regardingpolicy. In the meantime, a number of events were unfolding—in America and inGermany—that would affect the decision making of the War Department GeneralStaff.In the absence of policy, ideas were floated at the Pentagon. Some, like MajorGeneral Kenneth B. Wolfe, of the Army Air Forces, took matters into their ownhands. General Wolfe was chief of engineering and procurement for Air TechnicalService Command at Wright Field, and he supported Major General Knerr andColonel Putt in their quest for capturing Luftwaffe spoils discovered atVölkenrode. But General Wolfe envisioned an even bigger science exploitationprogram and felt strongly that policy needed to be set now. Wolfe flew to SHAEFheadquarters [endnotes.xhtml#en0301] in France to meet with Eisenhower’s deputy,General Lucius D. Clay, to promote his idea.General Clay told General Wolfe that he was not opposed to such a program butthat now was hardly a good time [endnotes.xhtml#en0302] to broach it. “Besiegedby the countless demands [endnotes.xhtml#en0303] and the chaotic conditionsrelevant to ending the war, and the burdensome complexities of planning for thepeace, [Clay] considered such efforts six months premature,” explains historianClarence Lasby. General Clay told General Wolfe to come back and talk to him insix months. Instead, Wolfe set out for Nordhausen, Germany, where his colleagueat the Pentagon, Colonel Gervais William Trichel, was running Special MissionV-2, the Top Secret scientific intelligence operation for the U.S. ArmyOrdnance, Rocket Branch.Inside the abandoned rocket production facility in the underground tunnelcomplex at Nordhausen, Special Mission V-2 was just getting under way. WhenGeneral Wolfe saw the vast numbers of V-weapons left behind, he became even moreconvinced that a U.S. program to exploit Nazi science had to happen now. Uponhis return to Washington, D.C., General Wolfe wrote to General Clay with arevised idea. Not only did the United States military need to act immediately tocapture Nazi armaments, Wolfe said, but America needed to hire the “Germanscientists and engineers” who had created the weapons and put them to work inAmerica. “If steps to this end are taken, the double purpose of preventingGermany’s resurgence as a war power and advancing our own industrial future maybe served.” Clay did not respond; he had already told General Wolfe to back offfor six months. Meanwhile, the work that was going on at Nordhausen under theauspices of Special Mission V-2 would greatly influence the future of all theNazi science programs that would follow.The man in charge of Special Mission V-2, twenty-eight-year-old Major Robert B.Staver, was no stranger to the military significance of the Nazis’ rockets.While preparing for Special Mission V-2 in London the winter before, Staver wasnearly killed by one. He and a British colleague had been working inside anoffice at 27 Grosvenor Square one afternoon in February when a loud blastknocked both of them to the floor. Staver went to the window and saw a “biground cloud of smoke where a V-2 had exploded overhead [endnotes.xhtml#en0305].”Watching pieces of burning metal rain down from the sky, Staver did a fewcalculations in his head and determined that the V-2 had likely been heading“very directly” at the building in which he was working when it blew upprematurely. A few weeks later, Major Staver was asleep in a hotel room near theMarble Arch when he was thrown out of bed by an enormous blast. A V-2 had landedin nearby Hyde Park and killed sixty-two people.The near-death experiences made him ever more committed to Special Mission V-2.For six weeks Staver worked twelve hours a day, seven days a week, studyingaerial photographs of Nordhausen supplied to him by the British and otherwiselearning everything he could [endnotes.xhtml#en0306] about the V-weapons. Assoon as the Allied forces liberated the tunnel complex, Major Staver would beone of the first intelligence officers inside.Now, finally, here he was at Nordhausen. It was May 12, 1945, and though hismission was almost complete, time was running out, because the Russians wereheaded into this area soon. By U.S. Army calculations [endnotes.xhtml#en0307],they would most likely arrive in eighteen days from Berlin.U.S. Army Ordnance believed that the V-2 rocket could help win the Pacific war,and for nearly two weeks Staver had been hard at work. He had overseen thecollection of four hundred tons of rocket parts, which had been loaded ontorailcars for delivery to the port at Antwerp, from where they would be shippedto the United States. But with his degree in mechanical engineering fromStanford University, Staver knew that the V-2 rocket was a lot more than the sumof its parts. Without blueprints or technical drawings, it was highly unlikelythat American engineers could simply cobble the rocket components together andmake the V-2 fly. The drawings and blueprints had to have been stashed somewherenear Nordhausen. If only Major Staver could find a German scientist to bribe, hemight be able to find out where the crucial documents were hidden.For two weeks now Staver had been traveling through the Harz Mountains touringunderground weapons factories, searching for a clue or a lead as to who mightknow more about the V-2 document stash. Locals told a wide variety of stories.Some spoke of paperwork going up in flames. Others talked about truckloads ofmetal trunks being hidden away in abandoned buildings, in beer gardens, and incastle walls. But this was all hearsay. No one could produce a concrete lead,and it was not exactly difficult to understand why. War crimes investigatorswere also in Nordhausen asking locals lots of questions. And as Staver trolledfor rocket scientists, American GIs continued to dig mass graves for thethousands of corpses found at Nordhausen-Dora slave labor camp. The entire townof Nordhausen still smelled of death.While driving around on his hunt, Staver kept boxes stashed in the back of hisarmy jeep, filled with cigarettes, alcohol, and cans of Spam. These valuableblack market goods worked well in exchange for information, and finally, Stavergot the lead he was looking for. A source told him that there was a V-2 rocketscientist by the name of Karl Otto Fleischer who lived nearby. Fleischer hadbeen an engineer inside the Nordhausen tunnels as well as the Wehrmacht’sbusiness manager, and he knew a lot more than he was letting on. Fleischerreported directly to General Dornberger; he knew things. Staver drove to thescientist’s residence with a proposition more powerful than a can of Spam.Major Staver told Karl Otto Fleischer that he could cooperate or go to jail.Important V-2 documents had been hidden somewhere around Nordhausen, Staversaid. If anyone knew, Fleischer did, Staver surmised. Dieter Huzel and BernhardTessmann had indeed told Fleischer about the document stash in the Dörnten minebefore they fled for the Bavarian Alps. But Fleischer’s allegiance was to hiscolleagues, so he lied to Staver and said he had no idea what Staver was talkingabout. He pointed the finger at another colleague, an engineer and von Braundeputy named Dr. Eberhard Rees. Ask Rees, Fleischer said[endnotes.xhtml#en0308]. He was the former chief in charge of the Peenemündeassembly line.When interviewed by Staver [endnotes.xhtml#en0309], Dr. Eberhard Rees played hisown disinformation card, using Major Staver’s influence to help spring a thirdcolleague from jail. Walther Riedel, chief of V-2 rocket motor and structuraldesign, had been one of the four men honored at the Castle Varlar event theprevious December. Now Riedel was receiving rough treatment[endnotes.xhtml#en0310] in a jail eighty miles away, in Saalfeld. He had beenmistaken by military intelligence as having been Hitler’s biological weaponschief. Agents with the Counter Intelligence Corps had knocked out several ofRiedel’s front teeth. His security report listed him as “an active Nazi who worethe uniform and the party badge. Ardent.” Riedel joined the Nazi Party in 1937and was a member of five Nazi organizations.In a series of interviews with Riedel, Major Staver found him to be a strangebird. Riedel was obsessed with outer space vehicles, which he called “passengerrockets.” In one interview, Riedel insisted [endnotes.xhtml#en0312] he’ddesigned these passenger rockets for “short trips around the moon[endnotes.xhtml#en0311],” and that he’d been pursuing “space mirrors which wouldbe used for good and possibly evil.” Riedel said he knew of at least fortyrocket scientists besides himself who should be brought to America to completethis groundbreaking work. If the Americans didn’t act, Riedel said, the Russianssurely would. Staver asked Riedel if he knew where the V-2 technical drawingswere hidden. Riedel said he had no idea.Staver was working on a number of problems, all compounded by the fact that theRussians were coming. That much was real. Nordhausen had been liberated by theAmericans and was originally designated to be part of the American zone. Stalinprotested, saying Russia had lost seventeen million men in the war and deservedgreater reparations for greater losses sustained. The Allies agreed to turn overa large swath of American-held German territory to the Soviets on June 1. Thisterritory included [endnotes.xhtml#en0313] all of Nordhausen and everything init.But Staver had more to worry about than the Russians. On May 18, 1945, anairplane arrived carrying a physicist and ordnance expert named Dr. Howard Percy“H. P.” Robertson. Robertson had been a team leader for Operation Alsos, and nowhe served President Eisenhower as chief of the Scientific Intelligence AdvisorySection under SHAEF. Dr. H. P. Robertson told Major Staver[endnotes.xhtml#en0314] that he intended to take rocket engineers Fleischer,Riedel, and Rees to Garmisch-Partenkirchen for interrogation, where they wouldbe held alongside General Dornberger and Wernher von Braun until the WarDepartment General Staff decided on a policy regarding Nazi scientists.Major Staver refused to give up Fleischer, Riedel, and Rees. They were hischarges, he told Robertson. As far as exploiting Nazi science for American use,Staver and Robertson saw eye to eye. But as far as giving Nazi scientistsspecial privileges, the two men were on opposite sides of the aisle. The ideaoutraged Robertson, who saw Nazi scientists as amoral opportunists who were“hostile to the Allied cause [endnotes.xhtml#en0315].”Dr. Robertson was a mathematical physicist [endnotes.xhtml#en0316] who had takena leave of absence from a professorship at Princeton University to help in thewar effort. He was a jovial, gentle man who liked crossword puzzles, Ivy Leaguefootball matches, and scotch. Robertson spoke German fluently and was respectedby Germany’s academic elite not just for his scientific accomplishments butbecause he had studied, in 1925, in Göttingen and Munich. Before the war, Dr.Robertson counted many leading German scientists as his friends. World War IIchanged his perspective, notably regarding any German scientist who stayed andworked for Hitler.While at Princeton, Dr. Robertson had become friendly with Albert Einstein. Thetwo men worked on theoretical projects together and spent time discussingHitler, National Socialism, and the war. Einstein, born in Germany, had workedthere until 1933, becoming director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Physicsand professor at the University of Berlin. But when Hitler came to power,Einstein immediately renounced his citizenship in defiance of the Nazi Party[endnotes.xhtml#en0317] and immigrated to the United States. Dr. Robertsonshared Einstein’s core view. It had been the duty of German scientists toprotest Hitler’s racist policies, beginning in 1933. Anyone who had served theReich’s war machine was not going to be given a free pass by H. P. Robertsonnow.Determined to keep the Nazi scientists in his custody, Staver played the Russiancard. Robertson may have been anti-Nazi, but he was also deeply patriotic. Withaccess to secret Alsos intelligence information, Robertson was well aware thatRussian rocket development was a legitimate and growing threat. Both men knewthat in as little as twelve days, the Russians would arrive in Nordhausen. IfStaver was not able to locate the V-2 documents by then, the Russians wouldeventually find them. Major Staver appealed to Dr. Robertson, arguing that hiskeeping Fleischer, Riedel, and Rees was the army’s last and best shot atlocating the hidden V-2 documents. Ultimately, Dr. Robertson agreed. In a finalappeal, Staver asked Robertson if there was anything Robertson could offer upthat might help him in his search for the V-2 stash. Some clue or detail thatStaver might be overlooking?Indeed there was. Dr. Robertson’s fluency in science and his familiarity withGerman scientific intelligence had thus far made him an extremely effectiveinterrogator of the Nazi scientific and military elite. Wehrmacht generals, SSofficers, and scientists were notoriously eager to speak with him. Listening toStaver, Dr. Robertson had an idea. He pulled a small writing pad out of hisshirt pocket and looked over his notes. During an earlier interrogation of arocket scientist named von Ploetz, Robertson had gotten an interesting lead. Hedecided to share it with Major Staver.“Von Ploetz said [endnotes.xhtml#en0318] that General Dornberger told GeneralRossman [the German army’s Weapons Office department chief] that documents ofV-weapon production were hidden in Kaliwerke [salt mine] at Bleicherode, walledinto one of the mine shafts,” read Robertson from his notes. Robertson suggestedthat Staver use that information to his advantage. He agreed to leave Fleischer,Riedel, and Rees with Major Staver while he headed to Garmisch-Partenkirchen tointerview General Dornberger and Wernher von Braun.At Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Robertson found the rocket scientists sunbathing inthe Alps. This lovely Bavarian ski resort was the place where Adolf Hitler hadhosted the Winter Olympics in 1936. Now the U.S. Army had hundreds of scientistsset up in a former military barracks here. The food was plentiful, and the airwas fresh and clean. “Mountain springtime,” Dieter Huzel recalled in his memoir.“Trees by now had donned their fresh, new green, flowers everywhere as far asone could see from our windows and balconies. Rain was infrequent and almostevery day sunbathing was possible on a lawn-covered yard.” Huzel’s onlycomplaint was that he didn’t receive mail and couldn’t make telephone calls.Wernher von Braun, General Dornberger, and their group had been here since beingtransferred from CIC headquarters in Reutte. Isolated in the Alps, the twoscientists had been frustrating their interrogators, stonewalling andwithholding information. Dr. Robertson came to see if he could get any betterinformation out of the scientists. Most of the rocket team was here, includingthe two men who had stashed the V-2 documents that Staver was now searching for,Dieter Huzel and Bernhard Tessmann. Neither Huzel nor Tessmann had shared[endnotes.xhtml#en0319] with von Braun or Dornberger the fact that they’d toldKarl Otto Fleischer the location of the stash in the Dörnten mine. Dornbergerand von Braun were under the assumption that they held all the bargaining chips.The intelligence officer Walter Jessel had sensed something was amiss withDornberger and von Braun—that the two rocket scientists were playing games.“Control was exercised by Dornberger in the course of the CIOS investigations,”Jessel noted in one report. Dornberger’s “first instructions [to otherscientists], probably under the impression of immediate transfer of the wholegroup to the United States, were to cooperate fully with the investigators,”Jessel explained. But as the days wore on and no deal was offered by the Allies,Jessel watched Dornberger become intractable. “Sometime later, he [Dornberger]gave the word [to the others] to hold back on information and say as little aspossible.” The scientists were walking on the razor’s edge. If they said toomuch, many of them could be implicated in the slave labor war crimes, as was thecase with Arthur Rudolph, Mittelwerk operations director.For Rudolph, it was best to say as little as possible. He described his time atGarmisch-Partenkirchen as enjoyable because it meant that “the horrible days offleeing were over.” Years later, he described his weeks of internment in theAlps as ones where he could finally “enjoy a few days of relief,” but thisrelief was short-lived owing to his “restless intellect.” Rudolph demanded moreof himself than a suntan, he later said. “There were already rumors that theAmericans would take us to the U.S.A. So, I decided I needed to learn English.”Arthur Rudolph’s interrogator saw Rudolph differently than he saw himself. Inmilitary intelligence documents, Rudolph was described as “100% Nazi,[endnotes.xhtml#en0320]” a “dangerous type.” There was a decision to be made:whether to use Rudolph as an intelligence source or to intern him fordenazification and investigation into possible war crimes. Denazification was anAllied strategy to democratize and demilitarize postwar Germany and Austriathrough tribunals [endnotes.xhtml#en0321] in local civilian courts(Spruchkammern) that were set up to determine individual defendants’ standings.Each German who was tried was judged to belong in one of five categories, orclasses: (1) major offenders; (2) party activists, militarists, and profiteers;(3) individuals who were less incriminated; (4) Nazi Party followers; (5) thosewho were exonerated. Rudolph’s interrogator did not believe a committed Nazilike Arthur Rudolph would make a viable intelligence source, and he wrote,“suggest internment.”Rudolph hoped he would be hired by the Americans. He located a murder mystery inthe Garmisch-Partenkirchen library, The Green Archer, [endnotes.xhtml#en0322]and attempted to learn English for what he believed, correctly, would be a newjob.Back in Nordhausen, Major Staver was making headway [endnotes.xhtml#en0323].Working on the new tip from Dr. Robertson, Staver drove to meet with his newsource, Karl Otto Fleischer, in a parking lot. This time, Staver had WaltherRiedel with him. In the parking lot, Staver demonstratively pulled a notebookfrom his breast pocket, just as Dr. Robertson had done with him. Staver readaloud a narrative he’d composed, part truth and part fiction. “Von Braun,[Ernst] Steinhoff, and all the others who fled to the south have been internedat Garmisch,” Major Staver told his two prisoners. “Our intelligence officershave talked to von Ploetz, General Dornberger, General Rossman, and GeneralKammler,” Staver said—also partially true. “They told us that many of yourdrawings and important documents were buried underground in a mine somewherearound here and that Riedel, or you[,] Fleischer, could help us find them,”Staver said, which was made up.Staver told the men that it was in their best interest to think over their nextmove very carefully. They could cooperate, he said, and give up the location ofthe V-2 documents. Or they could stonewall and risk being put in prison forwithholding information. They had one night to consider the offer. Staver wouldmeet the two men the following morning, in the same parking lot, at exactly11:00.When Staver arrived at the rendezvous point the next day, he was disheartened tofind Riedel waiting for him but not Fleischer. Even odder, Riedel said he had amessage from Fleischer to pass along: Fleischer was waiting for Major Staver inHaynrode, a nearby village, with “some very important news.” Staver needed totravel to Haynrode, find a boardinghouse called the Inn of the Three Lime Trees,and ask for the concierge. Was this some kind of a trap, or just another wildgoose chase?Staver and Walther Riedel drove together to the Inn of the Three Lime Trees[endnotes.xhtml#en0324]. There, they met up with the innkeeper, who produced amessage from Fleischer. Staver and Riedel were to walk through town, pass down along alleyway, and head to the edge of the village, where they were to go to thehome of a local priest. Staver and Riedel followed the trail, finally arrivingat the priest’s house. There, in flawless English, the priest told Major Staverthat Fleischer would see him soon. Fleischer emerged at the top of the stairs,came down, and asked Staver to follow him outside so the two men could talkprivately under an apple tree. There, “in almost inaudible[endnotes.xhtml#en0325], somewhat apologetic tones[,] Fleischer admitted he hadnot been completely frank” about the whereabouts of the V-2 document stash,Staver explained. In fact, he knew where they were hidden and “believed he wasthe only one in Nordhausen who did.” But there was a problem, Fleischer said. Hedescribed to Staver how the caretaker at the mine had dynamited a wall of rubbleover the entrance so no one could find them. This man was an ardent Nazi andwould never turn over the documents to an American officer like Major Staver.Fleischer said he’d take Dr. Rees with him to do the job. As unreliable as hewas, Staver decided to take Fleischer at his word. He gave him passes thatallowed for travel around Nordhausen as well as enough gasoline to get back andforth between Nordhausen and the mine. Fleischer and Rees succeeded in gettingthe mine’s caretaker, Herr Nebelung, to cooperate. Local miners were paid byFleischer, using money from the U.S. Army, to excavate through the rubble andretrieve the documents hidden in the mine.The stash was enormous, the crates weighing more than fourteen tons. Only nowthere was a new hurdle to overcome. British soldiers were set to arrive inNordhausen on May 27 to oversee the transition to Red Army rule. This meant thatMajor Staver had to get the documents out fast. The original agreement betweenthe British and the Americans was that the two Allies would share with oneanother everything they learned about the V-weapons. If the British found outStaver was planning to secretly ship one hundred V-2 rockets back to the UnitedStates, they would likely consider it a double-cross. Major Staver needed to getto Paris. It was the only way he could obtain access to the ten-ton trucksnecessary for moving such a large cache in such a short period of time.Staver assigned a colleague to oversee the Dörnten mine operation while heattempted to hitch a ride [endnotes.xhtml#en0326] to Paris in a P-47Thunderbolt. The pilot said it was impossible—that the Thunderbolt was asingle-seat fighter. Staver said that his mission was urgent and offered to ridein the tiny space behind the pilot’s seat. The pilot finally agreed. Avoidingterrible weather higher up, the men flew all the way to Paris at “tree-toplevel” and arrived safely at Orly Field. Staver found a ride down theChamps-Élysées in a U.S. Army jeep. At Ordnance Headquarters he found the exactman he was looking for, Colonel Joel Holmes, sitting at his desk. As chief ofthe Technical Division, Colonel Holmes had the authority to grant Major Staverthe semitrailers he needed to evacuate the Dörnten mine stash before the Britishand the Russians arrived.But Staver had a second plan that he had been conceiving, and, as he laterexplained, this moment in Paris was his prime opportunity to act. He toldColonel Holmes that there was a third element necessary to make the V-2 rocketprogram in America a success. Staver had been locating rocket parts and thedocuments necessary to assemble them correctly. But to make the rockets fly, theAmericans needed the German scientists. The army needed to bring thesescientists to the United States, Staver explained. Their superior knowledgecould be used to help win the war in Japan.“You write the cable and I’ll sign it,” Staver remembered Colonel Holmes havingsaid. In Paris, Staver sat down and wrote a cable that would have a huge impacton the future of the Nazi scientist program. “Have in custody over 400 topresearch development personnel of Peenemünde. Developed V-2,” Staver wrote. “Thethinking of the scientific directors of this group is 25 years ahead of U.S.…Later version of this rocket should permit launching from Europe to U.S.” Giventhe enormity of this idea in 1945, that a rocket could one day actually fly fromone continent to another, Staver pushed: “Immediate action recommended toprevent loss of whole or part of this group to other interested parties.Urgently request reply [endnotes.xhtml#en0327] as early as possible.”The cable was sent to Colonel Trichel’s office at the Pentagon, and Major Staverreturned [endnotes.xhtml#en0328] to Nordhausen. The documents were loaded up anddriven to Paris under armed guard. From there, they were shipped to the ForeignDocuments Evaluation Center at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, in Maryland. SpecialMission V-2 was declared a success. The U.S. Army Ordnance, Rocket Branch, nowhad one hundred rockets and fourteen tons of technical documents in itspossession. But Staver did not view Special Mission V-2 as entirely complete. Hestill had his sights set on the rocket scientists themselves.With the arrival of the Soviets into Nordhausen less than forty-eight hoursaway, Staver got the approval he’d been waiting for from SHAEF headquarters. Hewent to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, picked up von Braun, and returned to Nordhausen.The clock was ticking. Staver needed von Braun’s help getting every last rocketscientist out of the Harz before the Soviets arrived.“We landed running,” remembered Staver’s team member Dr. Richard Porter. Back atNordhausen, the men got to work locating the scientists who were still living inthe area. Staver had a stack of note cards with the names and addresses of theV-2 engineers. He instructed every available U.S. soldier he could find to roundup anything with wheels—trucks, motorcycles, and donkey carts—and sent soldiersfanning out across the Harz. Scientists and their families were given an offer.They could be transported out of what would soon become the Russian zone, orthey could stay.Arthur Rudolph’s wife was in Stepferhausen, eighty-five miles south ofNordhausen, when a U.S. soldier arrived. “A black GI drove into town in a trucklooking for me,” remembered Martha Rudolph. “He had a list of names and mine wason it. He told me that if I wanted to leave to get ready. He would be back in 30minutes to pick me up. My friends all said, ‘Go, go—the Russians are coming[endnotes.xhtml#en0329]. Why would you want to stay here?’ So I packed up what Icould and left on the truck when the GI came back.” The Rudolphs’ daughter,Marianne, accompanied her to the train station.The scene at the station was surreal, recalling the horrific transport ofprisoners during the war but with the roles reversed, fate and outcome turnedupside down. Over one thousand Germans [endnotes.xhtml#en0330]—scientists andtheir families—stood on the platforms, waiting to fit themselves into boxcarsand passenger cars. The train’s engine had yet to be attached, and there was noannouncement explaining the delay. Tension escalated, but the crowd remainedcalm until a mob of displaced persons flooded the station. Word had leaked outthat German scientists were being evacuated out of Nordhausen in advance of theRed Army’s arrival. Suddenly, many other locals wanted out of the Harz, too. TheRed Army had a terrible reputation. There were stories of entire units arrivingin towns drunk and seeking revenge. At the railroad station, U.S. soldiers werecalled to the scene. Using the threat of weapons, they prevented any displacedperson who was not a scientist or an engineer from boarding the boxcars andpassenger cars.At the eleventh hour, Major Staver and Dr. Porter learned of one last potentialdisaster that needed to be dealt with. Right before boarding the train, GeneralDornberger confessed to having hidden his own stash of papers, an ace in thehole had Dornberger been double-crossed by von Braun and left out of theAmerican deal. General Dornberger told Major Staver that he had buried fivelarge boxes in a field in the spa town of Bad Sachsa. The boxes, which were madeof wood and lined in metal, contained critical information about the V-2 rocketthat would compromise the U.S. Army if it fell into Russian hands. In alast-ditch effort to find Dornberger’s secret stash, Staver and Porter set outon a final mission.The men drove sixty miles to the headquarters of the 332nd Engineering Regimentat Kassel, where they borrowed shovels, pickaxes, three men, and a minedetector. Back in a large field in Bad Sachsa, they searched the ground as iflooking for a buried mine. Finally, they located Dornberger’s metal-lined cases,which contained 250 pounds of drawings and documents. The stash was loaded ontoa truck and driven to an army facility in the American zone.On their way out of the Harz, Staver and Porter passed by Nordhausen to have onelast look. “I wanted to blow up [endnotes.xhtml#en0331] the whole factory atNordhausen before we pulled out but [I] couldn’t swing it legally. I was afraidat the time to do the job ‘unofficially,’ and have regretted it ever since,”Porter recalled. He was referring to the European Advisory Commission decree,signed by General Eisenhower on June 5, 1945, in Berlin, which prohibited thedestruction of military research installations in another power’s zone.The Soviets were now heirs to the Harz. Major Staver had succeeded in secretlyshipping out enough parts to reassemble one hundred V-2 rockets in America.Still, thousands of tons of rocket parts remained. For all the effort and moralcompromise that went into Special Project V-2, the Red Army would now have noshortage of wonder weapons parts to choose from. The underground slave laborfactory at Nordhausen was still virtually intact. Thousands of machine tools saton the assembly lines ready to manufacture more parts.After an eleven-day delay, the Russians finally arrived. Leading the pack weretechnical specialists from Soviet missile program chief Georgy Malenkov’sSpecial Committee for rocket research. For every German scientist that had takenup the U.S. Army’s offer to evacuate, between two and ten remained behind. TheSoviet secret police began rounding up hundreds of former rocket scientists andengineers and put them back to work. A Soviet guidance engineer named BorisChertok even managed to move into von Braun’s old villa, the one the SS hadconfiscated from a Jewish businessman a few years before. Chertok oversaw therenaming of the Nordhausen tunnel complex from the Mittelwerk to the InstituteRabe [endnotes.xhtml#en0332], an abbreviation for Raketenantrieb Bleicherode, orRocket Enterprise Bleicherode.Von Braun, eighty scientists, and their families were taken to the town ofWitzenhausen, forty miles from Nordhausen, in the American zone. There, theywere set up in a two-story schoolhouse [endnotes.xhtml#en0333] and paid to getto work on future rocket plans while Army Ordnance worked on a plan to bringthem to the United States, to the Fort Bliss Army Base, in Texas. The Americanshad been obsessed with the V-weapons during the war. Now they had the scienceand the scientists.In Washington, D.C., officials with the War Department General Staff remainedundecided on a policy regarding what to do with Nazi scientists. GeneralEisenhower’s questions about long-term plans had not yet been answered, andUndersecretary of War Robert Patterson was asked to weigh in. Major Staver’scable from Paris regarding the four hundred rocket scientists “in custody” drewattention to the issue. In America, five Nazi scientists had already beensecreted into the United States for classified weapons work. Just a few daysafter the German surrender, the director of naval intelligence successfullylobbied the War Department General Staff to circumvent State Departmentregulations so that a Nazi guided missile expert named Dr. Herbert Wagner andfour [endnotes.xhtml#en0334] of his assistants could begin working on technologymeant to help end the war with Japan. The War Department gave approval, and inmid-May Dr. Wagner and his team were flown from Germany to a small airstripoutside Washington, D.C., inside a military aircraft with the windows blackenedto keep anyone from seeing who was inside.During the war, Dr. Herbert Wagner had been chief missile design engineer atHenschel Aircraft. He was the man behind the first guided missile used in combatby the Reich, the Hs 293. This remote-control bomb was the nemesis of the U.S.Navy [endnotes.xhtml#en0335] and the British Royal Navy and had sunk severalAllied ships during the war. Not only did the U.S. Navy see glide bombtechnology as critically important in the fight in the Pacific, but they saw Dr.Wagner as a man with “knowledge, experience and skills unmatched anywhere in theworld.”The perceived importance of having Wagner’s expertise in the fight against Japanwas illuminated by a dramatic event unfolding in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, justas he and his team arrived. On May 15, 1945, a Nazi submarine, identified in aNew York Times headline as “the Japan-bound U-234,” surrendered itself[endnotes.xhtml#en0336] to the USS Sutton in the waters five hundred miles offCape Race, Newfoundland. Inside the submarine, which was en route to Japan, wasa cache of Nazi wonder weapons, “said to contain [endnotes.xhtml#en0337] whatfew aviation secrets may be left,” as well as “other war-weapon plans and piecesof equipment.” One of the wonder weapons on board was Dr. Wagner’s Hs 293 gliderbomb, meant for use against the U.S. Navy in the Pacific. Additionally, therewere drawings and plans [endnotes.xhtml#en0338] for the V-1 flying bomb and theV-2 rocket, experimental equipment for stealth technology on submarines, anentire Me 262 fighter aircraft, and ten lead-lined canisters containing 1,200pounds of uranium oxide—a basic material used in making an atomic bomb. Thespecifics of the weapons cache were not made public, but the notion that theNazis had sold the secrets of some of their most prized wonder weapons to theirAxis partner Japan was alarming. The scenario was made even more forbidding bythe fact that also on board the U-234 was a top Reich scientist whose job it wasto teach Japanese scientists how to copy and manufacture these Nazi wonderweapons for themselves.The scientist in the submarine was Dr. Heinz Schlicke, director of Naval TestFields at Kiel. To the public he was only identified as a German “technician.”In fact, Dr. Schlicke was one of the most qualified [endnotes.xhtml#en0339] Naziscientists in the field of electronic warfare. His areas of expertise includedradio-location techniques, camouflage, jamming and counterjamming, remotecontrol, and infrared. The navy took Dr. Schlicke prisoner of war and broughthim to the Army Intelligence Center at Fort Meade, in Maryland.As for Dr. Wagner, the navy felt it needed to keep him happy so that his workwould continue to bear scientific fruit. To soften the reality of his being aprisoner, his incarceration was called “voluntary detention.” Wagner and hisassistants required a classified but comfortable place to work, the navy notedin an intelligence report [endnotes.xhtml#en0340], ideally in “an ivory tower ora gilded cage where life would be pleasant, the guards courteous, the locksthick but not too obvious.” The navy found what it was looking for in HempsteadHouse, a great stone castle on Sands Point, on the North Shore of Long Island,that was formerly the home of Daniel and Florence Guggenheim. The 160-acreestate had been donated by the Guggenheims to the navy for use as a trainingcenter. With its three stories, forty rooms, and sweeping view of the sea, thenavy decided it was an ideal location. Hempstead House was given the code namethe Special Devices Center, and Dr. Wagner and his assistants got to work.There were more problems afloat in Washington, this time coming from the FBI. IfNazi scientists were going to work for the U.S. military, the Department ofJustice said it needed to perform background checks. J. Edgar Hoover’s FBIlooked into Dr. Wagner’s past, based on information collected by armyintelligence in Europe, and learned that Dr. Wagner had “once belonged to theGerman SS,” the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party run by Himmler. This meantthat Wagner was an ardent Nazi. If he had stayed in Germany, as a former SSmember and per the laws of the occupying forces [endnotes.xhtml#en0342], hewould have been arrested and subject to a denazification trial. But the FBI wasmade aware of how badly the navy needed Wagner, and they labeled him “anopportunist [endnotes.xhtml#en0343] who is interested only in science.” TheFBI’s bigger concern, read an intelligence report, was how much Dr. Wagner hadbeen drinking lately. The FBI did not consider Wagner to be a “drunkard” butblamed his near-nightly intoxication on the recent death of his wife.The scientist in the submarine, Dr. Heinz Schlicke, became a prisoner at FortMeade, where it did not take long for the U.S. Navy to learn how “eminentlyqualified” he was. Soon, Schlicke was giving classified lectures[endnotes.xhtml#en0344] on technology he had developed during the war. The firstwas called “A General Review of Measures Planned by the German Admiralty in theElectronic Field in Order to Revive U-Boat Warfare.” The navy wanted to hireSchlicke immediately, but State Department regulations got in the way. Schlickewas already in military custody in the United States as a prisoner of war. Hewould have to be repatriated back to Germany before he could be given a contractto work in the United States, according to the State Department. The saga of theU-234 and its passenger made one thing clear: If the War Department was going tostart hiring German scientists on a regular basis, it needed to create acommittee to deal with the intricacies of each specific case. Finally, on May28, 1945, Undersecretary of War Robert Patterson weighed in on the classifiedsubject of hiring Nazi scientists for U.S. military research.Patterson wrote to the chief of staff to the president, Admiral William D.Leahy. “I strongly favor doing everything possible to utilize fully in theprosecution of the war against Japan all information that can be obtained fromGermany or any other source,” Patterson wrote. He also expressed concern. “Thesemen are enemies [endnotes.xhtml#en0345] and it must be assumed they are capableof sabotaging our war effort. Bringing them to this country raises delicatequestions, including the strong resentment of the American public, who mightmisunderstand the purpose of bringing them here and the treatment accordedthem.” Patterson believed that the way to avoid foreseeable problems with theState Department, which handled visa approvals, was to involve the StateDepartment in decision making now. Until a new committee was formed to dealspecifically with Nazi scientists, Patterson suggested [endnotes.xhtml#en0346]that the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee (SWNCC) be in charge.Patterson’s letter to the president’s chief of staff, which was not shared withPresident Truman, prompted a meeting at the Pentagon by the War DepartmentGeneral Staff. The group agreed on a temporary policy. Contracts would be givento a limited number of German scientists “provided they were not known oralleged war criminals.” The scientists were to be placed in protective militarycustody in the United States, and they were to be returned to Germany as quicklyas possible after their classified weapons work was complete.A cable was sent to General Eisenhower, at SHAEF headquarters in Versailles,fulfilling his two-week-old request to be advised on longer-term policy. Butwhat had been decided in Washington, D.C., had very little impact on the realityof what was going on in the European Theater with scientists who had spent yearsserving Adolf Hitler."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVEN [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter007]HITLER’S DOCTORS [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter007]During the war, physicians with the U.S. Army Air Forces heard rumors aboutcutting-edge research being developed by the Reich’s aviation doctors. TheLuftwaffe was highly secretive about this research, and its aviation doctors didnot regularly publish their work in medical journals. When they did, usually ina Nazi Party–sponsored journal like Aviation Medicine [endnotes.xhtml#en0347](Luftfahrtmedizin), the U.S. Army Air Forces would circumvent copyright law,translate the work into English, and republish it for their own flight surgeonsto study. Areas in which the Nazis were known to be breaking new ground wereair-sea rescue programs, high-altitude studies, and decompression sicknessstudies. In other words, Nazi doctors were supposedly leading the world’sresearch in how pilots performed in extreme cold, extreme altitude, and atextreme speeds.At war’s end, there were two American military officers who were particularlyinterested in capturing the secrets of Nazi-sponsored aviation research. Theywere Major General Malcolm Grow, surgeon general of the U.S. Strategic AirForces in Europe, and Lieutenant Colonel Harry Armstrong, chief surgeon of theEighth Air Force [endnotes.xhtml#en0348]. Both men were physicians, flightsurgeons, and aviation medicine pioneers.Before the war, Grow and Armstrong had cofounded the aviation medicinelaboratory at Wright Field, where together they initiated many of the majormedical advances that had kept U.S. airmen alive during the air war. At WrightField, Armstrong perfected a pilot-friendly oxygen mask and conductedgroundbreaking studies in pilot physiology associated with high-altitude flight.Grow developed the original flier’s flak vest—a twenty-two-pound armored jacket[endnotes.xhtml#en0349] that could protect airmen against antiaircraft fire.Now, with the war over, Grow and Armstrong saw unprecedented opportunity inseizing everything the Nazis had been working on in aviation research so as toincorporate that knowledge into U.S. Army Air Force’s understanding.According to an interview with Armstrong decades later, a plan was hatchedduring a meeting [endnotes.xhtml#en0350] between himself and General Grow at theU.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe headquarters, in Saint-Germain, France. Thetwo men knew that many of the Luftwaffe’s medical research institutions had beenlocated in Berlin, and the plan was for Colonel Armstrong to go there and trackdown as many Luftwaffe doctors as he could find with the goal of enticing themto come to work for the U.S. Army Air Forces. As surgeon general, Grow could seeto it that Armstrong was placed in the U.S-occupied zone in Berlin, as chiefsurgeon with the Army Air Forces contingent there. This would give Armstrongaccess to a city divided into U.S. and Russian zones. General Grow would returnto Army Air Forces headquarters in Washington, D.C., where he would lobbysuperiors to authorize and pay for a new research laboratory[endnotes.xhtml#en0351] exploiting what the Nazi doctors had been working onduring the war. With the plan set in motion, Armstrong set out for Berlin.The search proved difficult at first. It appeared as if every Luftwaffe doctorhad fled Berlin. Armstrong had a list of 115 individuals [endnotes.xhtml#en0352]he hoped to find. At the top of that list was one of the Reich’s most importantaviation doctors, a German physiologist named Dr. Hubertus Strughold. Armstronghad a past personal connection with Dr. Strughold.“The roots of that story go back to about 1934,” Armstrong explained in a U.S.Air Force oral history interview after the war, when both men were attending theannual convention of the Aero Medical Association, in Washington, D.C. The twomen had much in common and “became quite good friends [endnotes.xhtml#en0353].”Both were pioneers in pilot physiology and had conducted groundbreakinghigh-altitude experiments on themselves. “We had some common bonds in the sensethat he and I were almost exactly the same age, he and I were both publishing abook on aviation medicine that particular year, and he held exactly the sameassignment in Germany that I held in the United States,” Armstrong explained.The two physicians met a second time, in 1937, at an international medicalconference at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York City. This was before theoutbreak of war, Nazi Germany was not yet seen as an international pariah, andDr. Strughold represented Germany at the conference [endnotes.xhtml#en0397]. Thetwo physicians had even more in common in 1937. Armstrong was director of theAero Medical Research Laboratory at Wright Field, and Strughold was director ofthe Aviation Medical Research Institute [endnotes.xhtml#en0354] of the Reich AirMinistry in Berlin. Their jobs were almost identical. Now, at war’s end, the twomen had not seen one another in eight years, but Strughold had maintained thesame high-ranking position for the duration of the war. If anyone knew thesecrets of Luftwaffe medical research, Dr. Hubertus Strughold did. In Berlin,Harry Armstrong became determined to find him.One of the first places Armstrong visited was Strughold’s former office at theAviation Medical Research Institute, located in the fancy Berlin suburb ofCharlottenburg. He was looking for leads. But the once-grand German militarymedical academy, with its formerly manicured lawns and groomed parks, had beenbombed and was abandoned. Strughold’s office was empty. Armstrong continued hisjourney across Berlin, visiting universities that Strughold was known to beaffiliated with. Every doctor or professor he interviewed gave a similar answer:They claimed to have no idea where Dr. Strughold and his large staff ofLuftwaffe doctors had gone.At the University of Berlin, Armstrong finally caught a break when he cameacross a respiratory specialist named Ulrich Luft [endnotes.xhtml#en0355],teaching a physiology class to a small group of students inside a wreckedclassroom. Luft was unusual-looking, with a shock of red hair. He was tall,polite, and spoke perfect English, which he had learned from his Scottishmother. Ulrich Luft told Harry Armstrong [endnotes.xhtml#en0356] that theRussians had taken everything from his university laboratory, including thefaucets and sinks, and that he, Luft, was earning money in a local clinictreating war refugees suffering from typhoid fever. Armstrong saw opportunity inLuft’s predicament and confided in him, explaining that he was trying to locateGerman aviation doctors in order to hire them for U.S. Army–sponsored research.Armstrong said that, in particular, he was trying to find one man, Dr. HubertusStrughold. Anyone who could help him would be paid. Dr. Luft told Armstrong thatStrughold had been his former boss.According to Luft, Strughold had dismissed his entire staff at the AviationMedical Research Institute in the last month of the war. Luft told Armstrongthat Strughold and several of his closest colleagues had gone to the Universityof Göttingen. They were still there now, working inside a research lab underBritish control. Armstrong thanked Luft and headed to Göttingen to findStrughold. Whatever the British were paying him, Armstrong figured he would beable to lure Strughold away because of their strong personal connection. Therewas also a great deal of money to be made pending the authorization of the newresearch laboratory. Armstrong and Grow’s plan meant hiring more than fiftyLuftwaffe doctors. There was a lot of work to be had, not just for Strughold butfor many of his colleagues as well.A great drama was now set in motion owing to the fact that there was a secondarmy officer also looking for Dr. Hubertus Strughold—a medical war crimesinvestigator and physician named Major Leopold Alexander. Dr. Strughold’s namehad been placed on an army intelligence list of suspected war criminals with theCentral Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects, or CROWCASS. MajorAlexander was on a mission to locate him.It is not known if Armstrong was aware of the allegations against Strughold andchose to ignore them or if he was in the dark as to Strughold’s having beenplaced on the CROWCASS list. But as Armstrong forged ahead with plans to hireDr. Strughold and to make him a partner in the U.S. Army Air Forces laboratory,he did so in direct violation of the policy that had just been set by the WarDepartment. German scientists could be hired for U.S. military contract work“provided they were not known or alleged war criminals.” The CROWCASSallegations against Dr. Strughold were serious. They included capital warcrimes.The CROWCASS list came out of the immediate aftermath of the German surrender,when public pressure to prosecute Nazis accused of war crimes had reached feverpitch. On May 7, 1945, Life magazine published a story on the liberation ofBuchenwald, Bergen-Belsen, and other death camps, complete with graphicphotographs [endnotes.xhtml#en0406]. This was some of the first documentaryevidence [endnotes.xhtml#en0357] presented to the public. When confronted bythese ghastly images, people all over the world expressed their outrage at thescale of atrocity that had been committed by the Nazis. Death camps, slave laborcamps, the systematic extermination of entire groups of people—this defied therules of war. The idea of having a war crimes trial appealed to the generalpublic as a means of holding individual Nazis accountable for the wickedness oftheir crimes.The group responsible for investigating war crimes was the United Nations WarCrimes Commission (UNWCC) [endnotes.xhtml#en0358], located in London and foundedby the Allies in 1942 (it was originally called the United Nations Commissionfor the Investigation of War Crimes). The War Crimes Commission was notresponsible for hunting down the criminals; that job was delegated to SHAEF. TheWar Crimes Commission had three committees: Committee I dealt with lists,Committee II coordinated enforcement issues with SHAEF, and Committee III gaveadvice on legal points. The commission and its committees worked in concert withCROWCASS, also located in Paris, which was responsible for gathering andmaintaining information about suspected war criminals.After the fighting stopped, SHAEF sent war crimes investigators into the fieldto locate German doctors with the purpose of interrogating them. One of theseinvestigators was Major Leopold Alexander, a Boston-based psychiatrist andneurologist and a physician with the U.S. Army. Dr. Alexander had been tendingto wounded war veterans at a military hospital in England when he learned abouthis new assignment, just two weeks after the end of the war. With thisundertaking, his whole life would change, as would his understanding of what itmeant to be a doctor and what it meant to be an American.Dr. Alexander would unwittingly become one of the most important figures in theNuremberg doctors’ trial. And he would inadvertently become a central player[endnotes.xhtml#en0359] in one of the most dramatic events in the history ofOperation Paperclip. That would take another seven years. For now, at war’s end,Dr. Alexander accepted his orders from SHAEF, boarded a military transportairplane in England, and headed for Germany to begin war crimes investigativework. His first stop was the Dachau concentration camp. Dr. Alexander did notyet know that it was inside Dachau, in the secret barracks called ExperimentalCell Block Five, that Luftwaffe doctors had conducted some of the most barbaricand criminal medical experiments of the war.On May 23, 1945, Dr. Alexander, 39, was seated inside an American militarytransport airplane flying into Munich when, approximately fifteen miles north ofthe airport, his plane circled low and he saw the liberated[endnotes.xhtml#en0360] Dachau concentration camp for the first time. “Survivinginmates were waving and cheering at the plane and you could see that twoAmerican field hospitals were set up on the camp grounds,” Alexander wrote inhis journal late at night. American aircraft brought fresh corned beef, potatosalad, and real coffee by the ton to the newly liberated prisoners, many of whomwere still too weak to leave the camp. The airplanes also brought doctors andnurses [endnotes.xhtml#en0361] with the American Red Cross and the U.S. ArmyTyphus Commission and also, on occasion, a medical war crimes investigator likeDr. Alexander. The Dachau concentration camp was the first stop on a long listof Reich medical facilities and institutions that Dr. Alexander was scheduled tovisit, locations where medical crimes were suspected [endnotes.xhtml#en0362] ofhaving taken place. With him, Dr. Alexander carried SHAEF instructions thatgranted him “full powers to investigate everything of interest” and also gavehim the authority to “remove documents, equipment, or personnel as deemednecessary.”Fate and circumstance [endnotes.xhtml#en0363] had prepared him for the job. LikeSamuel Goudsmit, the scientific director of Operation Alsos, Dr. Alexander had aunique background that qualified him to investigate German doctors and had alsomade things personal. A Jew, he had once been a rising star among Germany’smedical elite. In 1933, Germany’s race laws forbade the twenty-eight-year-oldphysician from practicing medicine any longer. Devastated, he left the countryand wound up in America. Now, thirteen years later, he was back on German soil.His former existence here seemed like a lifetime ago.From as far back as he could remember, Leopold Alexander longed to be a doctor,like his father, Gustav. “One of the strongest unconscious motives for becominga physician was the strong bond of identification with my father,” he once said,explaining the pull toward medicine [endnotes.xhtml#en0364]. Gustav Alexanderwas an ear, nose, and throat doctor in turn-of-the-century Vienna, adistinguished scholar who published more than eighty scientific papers beforeLeopold was born. His mother, Gisela, was the first woman awarded a PhD[endnotes.xhtml#en0365] in philosophy from the University of Vienna, the oldestuniversity in the German-speaking world. From a young age Leopold led a charmedlife. The Alexanders were sophisticated, wealthy professionals who lived inintellectual-bohemian splendor [endnotes.xhtml#en0366] in a huge house with livepeacocks on the lawns. Sigmund Freud was a frequent guest, as was the composerGustav Mahler. By the time Leopold was fifteen, he was allowed to accompany hisfather on weekend hospital rounds. The father-son bond grew deep. On weekendsthey would walk through Vienna’s parks or museums, always engaged in livelyconversation about history, anthropology, and medicine, as Dr. Alexander laterrecalled.In 1929, Leopold Alexander graduated from the University of Vienna MedicalSchool and became a doctor, specializing in the evolution and pathology of thebrain. For almost every aspiring physician in Europe at the time, the goal wasto study medicine in Germany, and in 1932 Dr. Alexander was invited to enroll atthe prestigious Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research in Berlin. There hefirst rubbed elbows with Germany’s leading medical doctors, including KarlKleist, the distinguished professor of brain pathology who would become hismentor [endnotes.xhtml#en0367]. Alexander focused his studies on brain disordersand began fieldwork on patients with schizophrenia. Life was full of promise.Tragedy struck in two cruel blows. In 1932, Gustav Alexander was killed[endnotes.xhtml#en0368] by a former mental patient—murdered in cold blood on thestreets of Vienna by a man who, ten years earlier, had been hospitalized anddeclared insane. The second tragedy occurred in January of 1933, when AdolfHitler became chancellor of Germany. National Socialism was on the rise. Forevery Jew in Germany, life was about to change inexorably. Fortune blessed Dr.Alexander. On January 20, 1933, just days before Hitler took power, theambitious physician prepared to decamp to rural China to study mental illness.“I have accepted an invitation to go for half a year to Beijing Union MedicalCollege in Beijing (China) as an honorary lecturer in neurology and psychiatry,”Dr. Alexander wrote to his professors at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, promisingto return to Germany by October 1, 1933. It was a promise he was never tofulfill.Within two months of Hitler’s taking power, the Nazis initiated a nationwideboycott of Jewish doctors, lawyers, and business professionals. This wasfollowed, in April 1933, by the Reich’s Law for the Restoration of theProfessional Civil Service. It was now illegal for non-Aryans to work as civilservants, a ban that included every university teaching position throughoutGermany. In Frankfurt, where Dr. Alexander had lived, sixty-nine Jewishprofessors were fired. The news of Germany’s radical transformation reached Dr.Alexander in China. The Alexander family lawyer, Maximilian Friedmann, wrote hima letter warning against return. “The prospects in Germany are mostunfavorable,” Friedmann said. An uncle, Robert Alexander, was even more candidabout what was happening in Nazi Germany when he wrote to Dr. Alexander to saythat the nation had “succumbed to the swastika [endnotes.xhtml#en0370].” AJewish colleague and friend, a neurologist named Arnold Merzbach, also penned aletter to Dr. Alexander in despair, telling him that all of their Jewishcolleagues in Frankfurt had been dismissed from their university posts. “Ourvery existences [endnotes.xhtml#en0371] are falling apart,” Merzbach wrote. “Weare all without hope.”For months, Dr. Alexander lived in denial. He clung to the fantasy that Nazilaws would not apply to him, and he vowed to return once his fellowship ended.In China, Dr. Alexander [endnotes.xhtml#en0372] was in charge of theneurological departments of several field hospitals, where he tended to soldierswith head injuries received on the battlefield. Ignoring the Nazi mandate thatnow barred Jews from working as doctors or professors, he wrote a letter toProfessor Kleist, his mentor in Germany, saying how much he looked forward toreturning home. Kleist wrote back to say that his return to Germany was “totallyimpossible.… You as a Jew [since] you have not served as a soldier in the FirstWorld War, can not be state employed.” In closing, Kleist wrote, “Have no falsehopes [endnotes.xhtml#en0373].” The letter may have saved Dr. Alexander’s life.Untethered in China, Alexander was now a nomad, a man without a home to returnto. With remarkable ambition and fortitude, he pressed on. As his father haddone before him, he wrote and published scientific papers; his were on mentalillness, which made him a viable candidate for a fellowship in America. Fortuneagain favored him when, in the fall of 1933, he learned that he had been awardeda position at a state mental hospital in Worcester, Massachusetts, fifty milesoutside Boston. Dr. Alexander boarded an American steamship called PresidentJackson and set sail for America by way of Japan. Out at sea, a strange eventoccurred. It happened in the middle of the long journey, when his ship was morethan a thousand miles from land. A series of violent storms struck, sendingpassengers inside for days until finally the weather cleared. On the first clearday, Dr. Alexander ventured outside to play shuffleboard. Gazing out across thewide sea, he spotted an enormous single wave traveling with great speed andforce, bearing down on his tiny steamship. There was no escape from what hequickly recognized as a tidal wave. Before Dr. Alexander could run back insidethe ship, the President Jackson was lifted up by this great wave. “The shiptraveled up [endnotes.xhtml#en0374] the steep slope very slowly, further andfurther, until we finally reached the top,” he wrote to his brother, Theo. Andthen, with the ship balancing precariously at the top of the wave, he describedthe terrifying feeling that followed. “Suddenly there was nothing behind it…nothing but a steep descent.” The ship began to free-fall, “its nose plungeddeep into the water.… The impact was harsh, water splashed to all sides, andthings fell to this side and that in the kitchen and common rooms.” The shipregained its balance, almost effortlessly, and steamed on. “The whole thinghappened so unbelievably fast,” Alexander wrote. “When it was over, I said tomyself now I understand the meaning of the saying, ‘the ocean opens up beforeyou and swallows you whole.’ ”It did not take long for Dr. Alexander to thrive in America[endnotes.xhtml#en0375]. He was a supremely hard worker. On average he sleptfive hours a night. Working as a doctor at a New England mental institution wasendlessly fascinating to him. He once told a reporter that what interested himmost was determining what made men tick. Only a few months after his arrival inNew England, he was promoted to a full-time position in the neuropsychiatricward at Boston State Hospital. While performing hospital rounds in 1934, he meta social worker named Phyllis Harrington. They fell in love and married. By 1938they had two children, a boy and a girl. A prolific writer, Dr. Alexanderpublished fifty scientific papers. By the end of the decade he’d been hired toteach at Harvard Medical School. He was a U.S. citizen now. Journalists wrotenewspaper articles about the “doctor from Vienna,” citing his outstandingaccomplishments in the field of mental illness. He had a new home; he had beenaccepted as one of Boston’s medical elite.In December 1941 America went to war. Dr. Alexander joined the fight[endnotes.xhtml#en0376] and was sent to the Sixty-fifth General Hospital in FortBragg, North Carolina, and then to an army hospital in England. For the durationof the war, Dr. Alexander helped wounded soldiers recover from shell shock. Healso collected data on flight fatigue. After the Germans surrendered, heexpected to be sent home. Instead he received his unprecedented order fromSHAEF. He was to go to Germany and investigate allegations of Nazi medicalcrimes. In doing so, he would come face-to-face with former professors, mentors,and fellow students. It was his job to figure out who might be guilty[endnotes.xhtml#en0377] and who was not.Dr. Alexander’s first trip to Dachau did not produce any significant leadsdespite rumors that barbaric medical experiments had gone on there. On June 5,1945, he traveled the twelve miles to Munich to visit the Luftwaffe’s Institutefor Aviation Medicine [endnotes.xhtml#en0378]. This research facility was headedby a radiologist named Georg August Weltz, still working despite Germany’scollapse. On paper Weltz was a man of repute. He was gentle-looking, fifty-sixyears old with a shock of white hair and a wrinkled, sun-tanned face. In theirfirst interview Weltz [endnotes.xhtml#en0379] told Alexander he had worked as amilitary doctor his entire life, beginning as a Balloon Corps physician in WorldWar I.Dr. Alexander had a SHAEF dossier on Weltz that revealed Weltz had joined theNazi Party in 1937, after which he had moved quickly up the Reich’s medicalchain of command. By 1941 he reported directly to the air marshal of theLuftwaffe, Erhard Milch, who reported to Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring. Bywar’s end, there were only a few men with more medical authority on Luftwaffeissues than Georg August Weltz—one of them being Dr. Hubertus Strughold.In their first interview, Weltz told Dr. Alexander that it had been his job toconduct a variety of research on methods of saving Luftwaffe pilots’ lives.Weltz cited what happened to Luftwaffe pilots in 1940 during the Battle ofBritain. Many had been shot down over the English Channel by the British RoyalAir Force and had bailed out of their crashing airplanes and initially survived.The fatalities, Weltz explained, often occurred hours later, usually fromhypothermia. The bodies of many Luftwaffe pilots had been rescued from the icywaters of the channel just minutes after they had frozen to death. The Luftwaffewanted to know if, through medical research, doctors could learn how to“unfreeze a man [endnotes.xhtml#en0380],” to bring him back to life. Dr. Weltztold Dr. Alexander that he and his team of researchers had performedgroundbreaking research [endnotes.xhtml#en0382] in this area. Weltz declaredthat they had in fact made a “startling and useful discovery[endnotes.xhtml#en0381].” The results, said Weltz, were simply “astounding.”Dr. Alexander asked, “What kind of results?”Weltz hesitated to provide details but promised that the U.S. Army would be veryinterested in the knowledge he possessed. Weltz asked Dr. Alexander if a dealcould be made. Weltz said that he was interested in securing a grant with theRockefeller Foundation. Dr. Alexander explained that he had no authority withany private-sector foundation and that, before anything else, he needed Weltz totell him about this so-called “astounding” discovery.Weltz said he and his team had solved an age-old riddle [endnotes.xhtml#en0383]:Can a man who has frozen to death be brought back to life? The answer, Weltzconfided, was yes. He had proof. He and his team had solved this medicalconundrum through a radical rewarming technique they’d invented. Alexander askedWeltz to be more specific. Weltz said success was dependent upon precise bodytemperature and duration of rewarming in direct proportion to a man’s weight. Hewas not at liberty to provide data just yet, but the method his team haddeveloped was so effective that the Luftwaffe air-sea rescue service hademployed this very technique [endnotes.xhtml#en0384] during the war. Theexperiments, said Weltz, had been conducted on large animals. Cows, horses, and“adult pigs [endnotes.xhtml#en0385].”Dr. Alexander was in Germany to investigate Nazi medical war crimes. He gotstraight to the point and asked Weltz whether human beings had ever been used inthese Luftwaffe experiments.“Weltz explicitly stated [endnotes.xhtml#en0386] that no such [humanexperiments] had been done by him and that he did not know of any such workhaving been done,” Dr. Alexander wrote in his classified report. But the way inwhich Weltz responded made Dr. Alexander deeply suspicious of him.Dr. Alexander was in a conundrum. Should he have Weltz arrested? Or was it bestto try to learn more? “I still felt it wiser for the purposes of thisinvestigation not to resort to coercive measures such as an arrest,” Alexanderexplained. He asked Weltz to take him to the laboratory where these experimentson large animals were performed.Weltz claimed that because of heavy bomb damage in Munich the Luftwaffe’s testfacility for its rewarming techniques had been moved out to a dairy farm in therural village of Weihenstephan. Alexander and Weltz drove there together in anarmy jeep. An inspection of the farm revealed a state-of-the-art low-pressurechamber concealed in a barn. This, Weltz explained, was where Luftwaffe pilotslearned performance limits under medical supervision. Also called ahigh-altitude chamber, the apparatus allowed aviation doctors to simulate theeffects of high altitude on the body. But the rewarming facilities were nowhereto be seen. Where were they? Dr. Alexander asked.Weltz hesitated and then explained. They’d been moved, Weltz said—this time toan estate near Freising, at a government-owned experimental agriculturalstation. Dr. Alexander insisted on seeing the Freising facility, and the two mengot back into the army jeep and drove on. In Freising, Alexander was shown yetanother impressive medical research facility, also hidden in a barn, completewith a library and X-ray facilities, all meticulously preserved. But thelaboratory was clearly designed to handle experiments on small animals, mice andguinea pigs, not larger animals like cows, horses, and adult pigs. There wererecords, drawings, and charts of the freezing experiments—all carefullypreserved. But, again, they chronicled experiments on small animals, mostlymice. Where had the large animal experiments taken place? Weltz took Alexanderto the rear of the barn, behind a stable and into a separate shed located far inthe back of the property. There Weltz pointed to two dirty wooden tubs[endnotes.xhtml#en0387], both cracked.It was an extraordinary moment, Dr. Alexander would later testify, horrifying inits clarity. Neither of the tubs could possibly fit a submerged cow, horse, orlarge pig. What these tubs “could fit was a human being,” Dr. Alexander said.The grim reality of Dr. Weltz’s Luftwaffe research became painfully clear. “Icame away from all these interviews with the distinct conviction thatexperimental studies on human beings, either by members of this groupthemselves, or by other workers well known to and affiliated [with] the membersof this group, had been performed but were being concealed[endnotes.xhtml#en0388],” Dr. Alexander wrote. Without an admission of guilt, hehad only suspicion. To make an arrest, he needed evidence. He thanked Dr. Weltzfor his assistance and told him that he would be returning sometime in thefuture for a follow-up visit.Dr. Alexander had been on German soil for two weeks, and the deviance of Naziscience overwhelmed him. In a letter to his wife, Phyllis, he described what hadbecome of German science under Nazi rule. “German science presents[endnotes.xhtml#en0389] a grim spectacle,” he wrote. “Grim for many reasons.First it became incompetent and then it was drawn into the maelstrom ofdepravity of which this country reeks—the smell of the concentration camps, thesmell of violent death, torture and suffering.” German doctors were notpracticing science, Alexander said, but “really depraved pseudoscientificcriminality.” In addition to investigating crimes committed in the name ofaviation medical research, Dr. Alexander was the lead investigator looking atcrimes committed in the name of neuropsychiatry and neuropathology. In thiscapacity, he came face-to-face with the odious and core Nazi belief that hadinformed the practice of medicine under Hitler’s rule. Not only were all peoplenot created equal in the eyes of the Third Reich, but some people were actuallynot humans at all. According to Nazi ideology, Untermenschen[endnotes.xhtml#en0390]—subhumans, as they were called, a designation thatincluded Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Poles, Slavs, Russian prisoners of war, thehandicapped, the mentally ill, and others—were no different from white mice orlab rabbits whose bodies could thereby be experimented on to advance the Reich’smedical goals. “The sub-human is a biological creature, crafted by nature,”according to Heinrich Himmler, “which has hands, legs, eyes, and mouth, even thesemblance of a brain. Nevertheless, this terrible creature is only a partialhuman being.… Not all of those who appear human are in fact so.” German citizenswere asked to believe this pseudo-science; millions did not protest. Germanscientists and physicians used this racial policy to justify torturous medicalexperiments resulting in maiming and death. In the case of the handicapped andthe mentally ill, the Untermenschen theory was used by German doctors andtechnicians to justify genocide.As a war crimes investigator, Dr. Alexander was one of the first Americanservicemen to learn that the Reich had first sterilized and then euthanizednearly its entire population of mentally ill persons, including tens ofthousands of children, under the Law for the Prevention of Genetically DiseasedOffspring [endnotes.xhtml#en0391]. All across southern Germany, one Germanphysician after the next admitted to Dr. Alexander his knowledge of the childeuthanasia program. This included Dr. Alexander’s own mentor and formerprofessor, the neurologist Karl Kleist. During an interview in Frankfurt, Kleistconfessed to Dr. Alexander that he had known of the policy of euthanasia, and hehanded over military psychiatric reports that allowed him to circumvent personalresponsibility and claim he was just following orders. Kleist was not arrested,but a few days later he was removed from his teaching job. The former teacherand student never spoke again, and it remains a mystery if Dr. Alexanderrequested that Kleist be fired [endnotes.xhtml#en0392]. Within a few yearsKleist’s name would appear on a secret Paperclip recruiting list. It is notknown if he came to the United States.Each day brought atrocious new information. “It sometimes seems as if[endnotes.xhtml#en0393] the Nazis had taken special pains in making practicallyevery nightmare come true,” Dr. Alexander later told his wife, comparing Reichmedicine to something out of a dark German fairy tale. Whereas doctors who knewabout the euthanasia program tended to be forthcoming with information—theprogram was “justified” by a German law kept secret from the general public—itstruck Dr. Alexander that criminal human experiments by Luftwaffe doctors, likethe freezing experiments Weltz was involved in, appeared to have been moreskillfully concealed. If Dr. Alexander wanted to learn the facts about whatLuftwaffe doctors had been up to during the war, he knew that he had tounderstand the bigger picture. And he also had to determine where else thecrimes might have taken place. The best way to do this was to interview the mannearest the top, Dr. Hubertus Strughold. Strughold had directed the AviationMedical Research Institute for the Luftwaffe for ten of the twelve years of NaziParty rule. When Dr. Alexander learned that Dr. Strughold was in Göttingen, inthe British zone, he headed there.En route to Göttingen, Dr. Alexander had a fortuitous break. “A curiouscoincidence played into my hands,” he wrote. “On my way to Göttingen[endnotes.xhtml#en0394]… while having dinner in the Officers’ mess of the 433rdA. A. Bn. [Army Battalion] in camp Rennerod, Westerwald, I happened to meetanother casual guest, an army chaplain, Lieutenant Bigelow. In the course of ourconversation, Lt. Bigelow told me he was quite eager to get my ideas aboutrather cruel experiments on human beings, which had been performed at Dachauconcentration camp. He had learned of them from a broadcast a few days earlierwhen ex-prisoners of Dachau had talked about these grim experiments over theAllied radio in Germany.” This was exactly the kind of lead Dr. Alexander waslooking for, and he asked Lieutenant Bigelow to share with him anything else heremembered from the radio report.Lieutenant Bigelow told Alexander that as a member of the clergy he hadministered to many war victims. He had heard frightful stories about what hadgone on in the medical blocks at the concentration camps. But nothing comparedto what he had heard in that radio report. Doctors at Dachau had frozen peopleto death, in tubs of ice-cold water, to see if they could be unfrozen andbrought back to life. These experiments were apparently meant to simulateconditions that Luftwaffe pilots went through after they’d been shot down overthe English Channel, Bigelow said. Dr. Alexander now had a solid new lead. Tohis mind, the experiments [endnotes.xhtml#en0395] Bigelow was referring tosounded “strikingly similar to the animal experiments performed by Dr. Weltz andhis group” at the Freising farm. Was the Luftwaffe involved in medical researchat the concentration camps? Dr. Alexander asked the chaplain if he had caughtany of the names of the doctors involved in the Dachau medical crimes. Bigelowsaid that he couldn’t recall but that he was certain he had heard that theLuftwaffe was involved. More determined than ever to investigate, Dr. Alexandercontinued on to Göttingen to interview Dr. Hubertus Strughold.At the Institute for Physiology in Göttingen, Dr. Alexander located Strugholdand arranged to interview him, getting straight to the point. Dr. Alexander toldDr. Strughold [endnotes.xhtml#en0396] about the radio report claiming thatfreezing experiments had been conducted by the Luftwaffe at Dachau. DidStrughold, as the physician in charge of aviation medical research for theLuftwaffe, know about these criminal experiments at Dachau? Dr. Strughold saidthat he had learned of the experiments at a medical symposium he attended inNuremberg in October 1942. The conference, called “Medical Problems of SeaDistress and Winter Distress,” took place at the Hotel Deutscher Hof andinvolved ninety Luftwaffe doctors. During that conference, Strughold said, a mannamed Dr. Sigmund Rascher [endnotes.xhtml#en0398] presented findings that hadbeen obtained from experiments performed on prisoners at the Dachauconcentration camp. This was the same man “who had been mentioned over theallied radio the other day,” Strughold said. He called Rascher a fringe doctorwhose only assistant at Dachau was his wife, Nini. Both Raschers were now dead.Did Strughold approve [endnotes.xhtml#en0399] of these experiments? Strugholdtold Dr. Alexander that “even though Dr. Rascher used criminals in hisexperiments, he [Strughold] still disapproved of such experiments innon-consenting volunteers on principle.” Dr. Strughold promised Dr. Alexanderthat within his institute in Berlin he had “always forbidden even the thought ofsuch experiments… firstly on moral grounds and secondly on grounds of medicalethics.” Alexander asked Strughold if he knew of any other Luftwaffe doctors whohad been involved in human experiments at Dachau. Strughold said, “Anyexperiments on humans that we have carried out were performed only on our ownstaff and on students interested in our subject on a strictly volunteer basis.”He did not reveal that a number of doctors on his staff had visited Dachauregularly and worked on research experiments there.Also in Göttingen, Dr. Alexander interviewed several other doctors who hadworked for Strughold, asking each of them specific questions about humanexperiments. Each doctor told a strikingly similar story. Dr. Sigmund Rascherwas to blame for everything that went on at Dachau and now Rascher was dead. Butone man, a physiologist named Dr. Friedrich Hermann Rein, let an important clueslip. Dr. Rascher had been an SS man, Rein said. This information gave Dr.Alexander a significant new piece of the puzzle he did not have before, namely,that the SS was also involved in the concentration camp freezing experiments.This was a revelation.The day after this disclosure, Dr. Alexander received further extraordinary,related news [endnotes.xhtml#en0400]. “I learned that the entire contents ofHimmler’s secret cave in Hallein, Germany [sic], containing a vast amount ofmiscellaneous specially secret S.S. records, had recently been discovered andtaken” to the Seventh Army Document Center in Heidelberg. This huge trove ofpapers had been discovered by soldiers hidden away in yet another cave. Thepapers had been stamped with the unmistakable logo of the SS, and they boreHimmler’s personal annotations, drawn in the margins in the green pencil heliked to use. Dr. Alexander set out for the Document Center to see what he couldglean from the files. These papers would turn out to be among the war’s mostincriminating discoveries in a single document find.In Heidelberg, Himmler’s documents were being inventoried and sorted out whenDr. Alexander first arrived. One of the men tasked to the job was Hugh Iltis,the son of a Czech doctor, who, with his family, fled Europe in advance of thegenocide. Iltis was a nineteen-year-old American soldier fighting on the frontlines in France during the last months of the war when, he recalls, “a carshowed up [endnotes.xhtml#en0401] and an officer leapt out and pointed at me,then shouted ‘You, come with me!’ ” Iltis climbed into the car and sped awayfrom the battlefield with the officer. Someone had learned that Hugh Iltis was afluent German speaker (and perhaps that his father was a leading geneticist andanti-Nazi). Iltis was needed in Paris to translate captured Nazi documents, andthe work kept on coming. Now, six months later, here he was in Heidelbergdocumenting atrocities for the War Crimes Commission. His discovery of theHimmler papers—it was Iltis who identified how important they were—would alsobecome the most important collection [endnotes.xhtml#en0402] of documents onNazi human experimentation to be presented at the doctors’ trial.Alexander told Iltis what it was that he was looking for: documents written byDr. Sigmund Rascher that involved experiments on humans. Together, the two menbroke the original seals [endnotes.xhtml#en0403] on the innocuously named CaseNo. 707-Medical Experiments, papers that turned out to include years ofcorrespondence between Rascher and Himmler.“The idea to start the experiments [endnotes.xhtml#en0404] with human beings inDachau was obviously Dr. Rascher’s,” Alexander explained in his classifiedscientific intelligence report. But as Alexander learned from the papers,Rascher was far from the only Luftwaffe doctor involved. Nor were the humanexperiments limited to freezing experiments. Even more damning, Dr. Alexanderlearned that one of Dr. Strughold’s closest colleagues and his coauthor, aphysiologist named Dr. Siegfried Ruff, was in charge of overseeing Rascher’shuman experiments at Dachau. This was stunning news. “Dr. Ruff, and hisassistant Dr. Romberg, joined forces [with Rascher] and arrived in Dachau with alow pressure chamber which they supplied,” Alexander wrote in his report. Thislow-pressure chamber was used for a second set of deadly experiments involvinghigh-altitude studies. Sitting inside the Seventh Army Documentation Centerreading the Himmler papers, Dr. Alexander realized that Dr. Strughold had liedto him when he had said that the only Luftwaffe doctor involved in the Dachauexperiments had been the “fringe doctor” Rascher. In fact, Strughold’s friendand colleague Dr. Ruff was deeply implicated.Most disturbing to Alexander were a group of photographs showing what happenedin the course of the experiments as healthy young men—classified by the Nazis asUntermenschen—were strapped into a harness inside the low-pressure chamber andsubjected to explosive decompression. These photographs, astonishing in theirsadism, were essentially before, during, and after pictures of murder in thename of medicine. Other photographs among the Himmler papers documented thefreezing experiments as they were being conducted at Dachau. Rascher’sexperiments were by no means the solo act of one depraved man. There werephotographs of yet another of Dr. Strughold’s Luftwaffe colleagues, Dr. ErnstHolzlöhner, holding prisoners down in tubs of icy water while their bodytemperatures were recorded as they died. It is believed that Rascher’s wife,Nini, took the photographs.In a classified CIOS report, Dr. Alexander expressed doubts about the veracityof Dr. Strughold’s earlier testimony from their first interview in Göttingen.The Dachau experiments were joint endeavors by the Luftwaffe and the SS, and,despite Strughold’s denials, several aviation doctors on his staff, includingindividuals who reported to directly to him, were named in the Himmler papers.“Strughold at least must have [endnotes.xhtml#en0407] been familiar with theparts played by his friend and co-worker Ruff,” Dr. Alexander wrote. In hisreport, he advised SHAEF that, while he could not yet say if Dr. Strughold wasdirectly involved in the death experiments, clearly Reich medical crimes “werestill being covered up by [endnotes.xhtml#en0408]” him.On June 20, Alexander headed back to Munich to confront Dr. Weltz. Instead, hefound a colleague of Weltz’s, a Dr. Lutz, who broke down and confessed that he’dbeen aware of the human experiments, but that they’d been conducted by his teammembers, not him. Lutz claimed to have been offered the “human job,” by Weltz,but declined to accept, on grounds that he was “too soft[endnotes.xhtml#en0409].”Before confronting Strughold, Dr. Alexander first returned to Dachau[endnotes.xhtml#en0411] to locate eyewitnesses. There, he found three formerprisoners who offered testimony [endnotes.xhtml#en0410]. John Bauduin, OscarHäusermann, and Dr. Paul Hussarek had managed to stay alive at the concentrationcamp by working as orderlies for the SS. After Dachau was liberated, the threemen chose to stay behind so as to help investigators piece together medicalcrimes. They formed a group, calling it the Committee for the Investigation ofSS Medical Crimes. From them, Dr. Alexander learned that the experiments hadbeen conducted on Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, and Catholic priests in thesecret, freestanding barracks called Experimental Cell Block Five. “In general,the death of prisoners transferred to Block 5 was expected within 2–3 days,”testified John Bauduin. The second witness, Dr. Hussarek, a Czech scholar sentto Dachau for committing “literary crimes,” told Dr. Alexander that “only a fewexperimental subjects survived the low pressure experiments. Most were killed.”All three men agreed that only one individual was known to have survived theexperiments, a Polish priest named Leo Michalowski.Father Michalowski’s testimony provided a critical missing link in the medicalmurder experiments and how they were so skillfully concealed. Luftwaffe reportsused the words “guinea pigs,” “large pigs,” and “adult pigs” as code words fortheir human subjects. In one of Weltz’s papers confiscated by Dr. Alexander,entitled “Alcohol and Rewarming,” Weltz wrote that “shipwreck experiments[endnotes.xhtml#en0412] had been [simulated] in large pigs.” The pigs wereplaced in tubs of water with blocks of ice and given alcohol to see if arewarming effect occurred. The results, wrote Weltz, showed that “alcohol inpigs does not increase or accelerate the loss of warmth.” In sworn testimony,Father Michalowski described [endnotes.xhtml#en0413] what had been done to himat Dachau: “I was taken to room No. 4 on Block 5.… I was dropped in the water inwhich ice blocks were floating. I was conscious for one hour… then given somerum.” In Weltz’s paper the word “large pig” really meant “Catholic priest.”On June 22, Dr. Alexander returned to the Heidelberg Document Center to locatemore information with the help of Hugh Iltis [endnotes.xhtml#en0414]. Armed withnew details and key words culled from survivor testimony, Dr. Alexander foundwhat Dr. Rascher had called his “experiment reports.” These charts, Alexandernoted, were a scientific chronicle of medical murder. Rascher had also hadbigger plans. He was working with the SS to have the aviation medicineexperiments relocated from Dachau to Auschwitz. “Auschwitz is in every way[endnotes.xhtml#en0415] more suitable for such a large serial experiment thanDachau because it is colder there and the greater extent of open country withinthe camp would make the experiments less conspicuous,” Rascher wrote. Dr.Alexander also learned about a grotesque “motion picture of the record of theexperiments” that had been shown at a private screening at the Air Ministry[endnotes.xhtml#en0416], at the behest of Himmler. The Luftwaffe doctoroverseeing this event was yet another close colleague of Dr. Strughold’s, aphysiologist and government official named Dr. Theodor Benzinger[endnotes.xhtml#en0417]. Dr. Alexander was unable to locate Benzinger but notedthe name in his report. He then returned to Göttingen to interview Strughold asecond time to see if he could confirm that Strughold had been lying to him.In Göttingen, things had changed. Investigators working on scientificintelligence projects for the U.S. Army Air Forces (AAF) and the Royal Air Force(RAF) had interviewed many of the Luftwaffe doctors, including Dr. Strughold.Their conclusions were remarkably different from Dr. Alexander’s. None of theRAF or AAF officers had traveled to the Document Center in Heidelberg to readthe Himmler files. Instead, their reports were meant to serve and supportArmstrong and Grow’s secret, new research lab.RAF Wing Commander R. H. Winfield wrote [endnotes.xhtml#en0418] in his report,“Strughold was the mainspring of German Aviation Medical Research” and had alarge staff of colleagues, including Dr. Siegfried Ruff, who all appeared tohave “suffered tremendously from their isolation during the war years.”Winfield, having no idea that Dr. Ruff had been the person in charge[endnotes.xhtml#en0405] of overseeing Rascher’s work at Dachau, stated that his“interrogations [of Ruff] revealed very little information not already known tothe Allies.” Winfield saw Dr. Strughold as a patrician figure, “considerablydisturbed about the welfare of his staff who, unable to evacuate Berlin, werenow threatened by the Russians.”Representing the U.S. Army Air Forces was Colonel W. R. Lovelace, an expert inhigh-altitude escape and parachute studies. The following decade, Lovelace wouldbecome famous as the physician for NASA’s Cold War–era Project Mercuryastronauts. For his confidential CIOS report, entitled “Research in AviationMedicine for the German Air Force,” Lovelace interviewed Dr. Strughold and manyof his colleagues, including the freezing expert, Georg Weltz. Like Winfield,Lovelace was in the dark about the medical murder experiments going on insidethe concentration camps. He saw Weltz’s research as benign and dedicated fivepages of his CIOS report to praising his studies on “rapid rewarming of thecooled animal.” Lovelace was particularly impressed by the fact that Weltz hadfrozen a “guinea pig” to death and was still able to record a heartbeat afterdeath. “[T]he heartbeat may continue [endnotes.xhtml#en0419] for some time ifthe animal is left in the cold,” Lovelace wrote in summation of Weltz’sfindings.Unlike Dr. Alexander, Colonel Lovelace was able to interview Strughold andRuff’s colleague Dr. Theodor Benzinger, the high-altitude specialist who ran[endnotes.xhtml#en0420] the Reich’s Experimental Station of the Air ForceResearch Center, Rechlin, located north of Berlin. This was the same Dr.Benzinger who had overseen for Himmler the film screening at the Reich AirMinistry, in Berlin, of Dachau prisoners being murdered in medical experiments.And while Dr. Alexander had this information, Colonel Lovelace had no idea.Lovelace was particularly interested in Benzinger’s work involving “highaltitude parachute escapes,” for which Benzinger had gathered much data andproduced “studies in reversible and irreversible deaths[endnotes.xhtml#en0421].” Benzinger told Lovelace that he performed his studieson rabbits.Finally, Lovelace interviewed Dr. Konrad Schäfer, a chemist and physiologistwhose wartime efforts to render salt water drinkable [endnotes.xhtml#en0422]made him famous in Luftwaffe circles. With high praise from RAF and AAFofficers, Doctors Ruff, Benzinger, and Schäfer were now each being consideredfor leading positions at the new research lab.It was the end of June 1945, and Dr. Alexander’s allotted time in the field as awar crimes investigator had drawn to a close. He was ordered back to London,where he would type up seven classified CIOS reports totaling more than fifteenhundred pages. Two weeks after Alexander left Germany, the chief of the Divisionof Aviation Medicine for the Army Air Forces, Detlev Bronk, and an AAF expert onthe psychological and physiological stresses of flying named Howard Burchell,arrived in Germany to evaluate progress on the new research laboratoryenvisioned by Armstrong and Grow. Bronk and Burchell interviewed many of thesame doctors and determined that they were all good candidates for the AAFcenter. Unlike Wing Commander Winfield and Colonel Lovelace, Bronk and Burchellhad been made aware of some of the controversy surrounding Strughold and hisLuftwaffe colleagues. In a joint report, they explained, “[N]o effort was madeto assess [the doctors’] political and ethical viewpoints, or theirresponsibility for war crimes.” They also concluded, “Strughold was not alwaysquite honest [endnotes.xhtml#en0423] in presenting the true significance of thework which he supported.” But Bronk and Burchell stated that it was theirposition that army intelligence was better qualified to determine who wasinadmissible “for political reasons” and who could be hired. As it turned out,military intelligence objected [endnotes.xhtml#en0424] to hiring Dr. Benzingerand Dr. Ruff, on the grounds that both men had been hard-core Nazi ideologues.But in the following month, army intelligence determined that the doctors’ workat Heidelberg would be “short term,” and both men were cleared for U.S. Armyemployment.A deal was made between the U.S. Army Air Forces and Dr. Strughold. He wouldserve with Armstrong as cochairman of a Top Secret research center that the AAFwas quietly setting up at the former Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Heidelberg, andto be called the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center. No one outside a smallgroup could know about this controversial project because, per JCS 1076, noforeign power was permitted to carry out military research of any kind inGermany, including in medicine.Dr. Strughold handpicked fifty-eight [endnotes.xhtml#en0425] Luftwaffe doctorsfor the research program, including Dr. Siegfried Ruff, Dr. Theodor Benzinger,and Dr. Konrad Schäfer—the first Nazi doctors to be hired by the U.S. Army AirForces. In Munich, Dr. Georg Weltz was arrested and sent to an internmentfacility for processing. From there, he would be sent to the prison complex inNuremberg to await trial.In less than two years, many of the Nazi doctors chosen by Dr. Strughold wouldquietly begin their secret journeys to the United States."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter008]BLACK, WHITE, AND GRAY [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter008]In Washington, with policy now informally set, the debate over the Naziscientist program [endnotes.xhtml#en0426] became intense inside theState-War-Navy Coordinating Committee (SWNCC). Like its successor organization,the National Security Council, SWNCC acted as the president’s principal forumfor dealing with issues related to foreign policy and national security. TheState Department was vocal in its opposition to the program. Exacerbating thesituation for the State Department was a parallel issue it had recently becomeembroiled in. South American countries, Argentina and Uruguay in particular,were known to be giving safe haven to Nazi war criminals who had escaped fromGermany at the end of the war. The State Department had been putting pressure onthese countries to repatriate Nazis back to Europe to face war crimes charges.If it came out that the State Department was providing not only safe haven butemployment opportunities for Nazi scientists in the United States, that would because for an international scandal. And while some generals and colonels in theWar Department were decidedly for the Nazi science programs, others werefundamentally opposed to the idea. A secretly recorded conversation between twogenerals at the Pentagon summed up the conflict that the very idea of Germanscientists working for the U.S. military created.“One of the ground rules for bringing them over is that it will be temporary andat the return of their exploitation they will be sent back to Germany,” said onegeneral, whose name was redacted.The second general agreed. “I’m opposed and Pop Powers [a nickname for aPentagon official] is opposed, the whole War Department is opposed,” he said. To“open our arms [endnotes.xhtml#en0427] and bring in German technicians and treatthem as honored guests” was a very bad idea.The Department of Justice was not happy about the voluminous workload thatbackground checks on former enemy aliens would require. The Department of Laborwas concerned about laws governing alien labor, and the Department of Commercewas concerned about patent rights. In an attempt to ease the contention,Undersecretary of War Robert Patterson sent a memorandum [endnotes.xhtml#en0428]to the War Department General Staff stating that the person to mediate theseissues was John J. McCloy, the assistant secretary of war and chairman of SWNCC[endnotes.xhtml#en0429].John J. McCloy would become an especially significant player in OperationPaperclip starting in 1949. But now, in the summer of 1945, he wore two hatsrelated to the issue of Nazi scientists. On the one hand, Undersecretary of WarRobert Patterson had put McCloy in charge of coordinating policy regarding Naziscientists coming to the United States to work. On the other hand, Patterson’sboss, Secretary of War Henry Stimson, had given McCloy the job of helping todevelop the war crimes program [endnotes.xhtml#en0430]. McCloy’s positionregarding the exploitation of Nazi science and scientists was clear. He believedthat the program would help foster American military superiority whileengendering economic prosperity. To McCloy, those ends justified any means. Itwas not that McCloy believed that the Nazis should go unpunished, at least notin the summer of 1945. For that, McCloy was a strong supporter of theInternational Military Tribunal (IMT) and the idea of a war crimes trial. But hewas someone who saw these two categories as black and white. There werescientists and there were war criminals.In McCloy’s eye [endnotes.xhtml#en0432]s, a war criminal was a Himmler, a Hess,a Göring, or a Bormann. Scientists, like industrialists, were the backbone of ahealthy economy [endnotes.xhtml#en0431] in this new, postwar world. In thesummer of 1945, McCloy was regularly briefed on the capture and arrest of thesewar criminals as they were rounded up and taken to a Top Secret interrogationfacility in Luxembourg, code-named Ashcan, where they would be squeezed forinformation before facing judgment at Nuremberg.John Dolibois, an officer with Army Intelligence, G-2, the Collecting andDissemination Division, spent a significant portion of the last eight months ofthe war watching and rewatching Triumph of the Will, the three-hour-long Nazipropaganda film by Hitler’s favorite filmmaker, Leni Riefenstahl. Every Thursdaynight, inside a screening room at Camp Ritchie, America’s Military IntelligenceTraining Center, located eighty miles north of Washington in the CatoctinMountains, the twenty-six-year-old Dolibois used the film to teach German orderof battle and Nazi Party hierarchy to colonels, generals, and intelligenceofficers preparing to go off to war.The Triumph of the Will documentary was an ideal teaching tool and enabledDolibois to point out to his students how individuals within the Nazi Partyhierarchy spoke and gestured, what insignia they wore, who was subordinate towhom. Between the hateful speeches and the endless parades, the fawning innercircle and the Nuremberg rallies, John Dolibois had become so familiar withHitler’s inner circle that he could almost recite their speeches himself.He enjoyed teaching, but, like so many dedicated Americans of his generation,Dolibois wished to see action overseas [endnotes.xhtml#en0433]. There was atinge of envy as well. He stayed in touch with his former colleagues fromOfficer Candidates School, most of whom had been sent to Europe months ago. Manyhad already been promoted to captains and majors. As the war in Europe drew to aclose, John Dolibois had accepted that he was, in all likelihood, not going tobe sent overseas as part of an interrogation team, called an IPW team, tointerview newly captured prisoners of war. Then, on Easter Sunday, April 1,1945, he received orders to ship out with the next detachment. Steaming out ofthe New York harbor only days later, he was standing on the deck of the Île deFrance when someone handed him a telegram. He’d been promoted to firstlieutenant.Things moved fast after he’d crossed the Atlantic. On April 13, Dolibois’s shiplanded in West Scotland. Every vessel in the harbor was at half-mast; PresidentRoosevelt had died the day before. A quick train trip to London bore witness to“appalling devastation.” Piles of rubble filled both sides of every street.Dolibois’s channel crossing took place under a full moon, and he was grateful toarrive in the war-torn port at Le Havre, France, without incident. “Up untilthen our move from Camp Ritchie to Le Havre had been well orchestrated,”explains Dolibois. “Now chaos set in.” Driving into Munich, destroyed vehiclesand weaponry littered the road. In the clearings in the woods sat small fleetsof wrecked Luftwaffe airplanes, their wings torn off and their fuselagespockmarked with holes. Corpses rotted in ditches. “Suddenly the war was veryreal [endnotes.xhtml#en0434],” Dolibois recalls.His first assignment was at the Dachau concentration camp, just two days afterits liberation. Dolibois had been sent to Dachau to look over groups of capturedGerman soldiers to see if important generals, party officials, or scientistswere hiding out among the crowd. “Primarily I was to watch for high rankingNazis in disguise,” remembers Dolibois. “We had reports [endnotes.xhtml#en0435]that many of them were passing themselves off as ordinary German soldiers, thushoping to be overlooked in the confusion and to disappear.” His job was tointuit the meaning of certain manners of walk, greeting, and speech. Doliboiswas on the lookout for anyone who might be useful to the Allies for a moredetailed interrogation at a facility elsewhere.At Dachau, John Dolibois scoured faces in the crowd for telltale marks, thingsthat could not be hidden. The most obvious among them were the dueling scars ofthe Nazi elite. But at Camp Ritchie Dolibois had also become an expert in signsof concealment. Recently shaved facial hair or patches pulled off uniforms wereindicators that a man had something to hide. True expertise, Dolibois knew, layin recognizing nuance.After a few days at Dachau, Dolibois received another assignment. He proceededto Central Continental Prisoner of War Enclosure Number 32, or CCPWE No. 32. Themission he was now on was classified Top Secret. Everyone he asked about CCPWENo. 32 said that they had never heard of it before. When Dolibois’s driver leftthe borders of Germany and began heading into Luxembourg, Dolibois becameoverwhelmed with memories. Luxembourg, of all places—how capricious to be onassignment here. John Dolibois was born in Luxembourg. He had moved to Americawhen he was a twelve-year-old boy, with his father; his mother had died in thegreat influenza pandemic. Driving into Luxembourg in 1945, Dolibois was seeinghis native country for the first time in fourteen years. As his army jeep madeits way into a little spa town called Mondorf-les-Bains, images of his youthflooded his mind. He recalled Mondorf’s “beautiful park [endnotes.xhtml#en0436],a quiet stream on which one could row a boat, lots of old trees, and acres offlowers.” Mondorf was built a few miles from the Moselle River in antiquity,developed by the Romans as a health resort. It was known for its restorativequalities, its mineral baths and fresh air. How different it all looked now,another small city devastated by war. Most homes and shops had been plundered ordestroyed. Driving along the main boulevard, Dolibois observed how the façadesof many houses had been blown off. He could see people carrying on with theirlives inside of what was left of their homes.Only when his jeep pulled up to its destination did Dolibois realize that he’darrived at the Palace Hotel [endnotes.xhtml#en0437]. It was unrecognizable tohim. A fifteen-foot-high fence ran around the main building, on top of which wasa double-stringed curl of barbed wire. There was a second fence that appeared tobe electrified. Camouflage netting hung from panels of fencing. Wide canvassheets had been strung from tree to tree. Huge klieg lights illuminated theplace. There were four guard towers, each manned by American soldiers holdingpowerful machine guns. Not even in photographs had John Dolibois seen an Alliedprison facility in the European war theater as heavily fortified as this placewas. At the front gate there was a jeep, parked and with its engine turned off.A stern-faced sergeant sat inside. His name tag read “Sergeant of the Guard,Robert Block.” Block addressed Dolibois with a nod.“Good afternoon, sergeant,” Dolibois said. “I’m reporting for duty here.”Block just stared at him. Dolibois recalled asking what kind of place this was.What was going on inside?Block said he had not been inside.There was a long, uncomfortable pause. Finally Block spoke. “To get in here youneed a pass signed by God.” He nodded at the prisoner-of-war facility behindhim. “And have somebody verify the signature.”Dolibois handed over his papers. After Block looked at them, the gate swung openand Dolibois was waved inside. In spite of its fortifications, the Palace Hotelremained surprisingly unscathed by war. The boomerang-shaped building was fivestories tall [endnotes.xhtml#en0438]. The fountain at the front entrance lackedwater, its stone-carved nymph rising up from an empty pool. Inside the hotelfoyer Dolibois was greeted by two guards. A third soldier handed him a key andpointed up a flight of stairs. He told Dolibois to leave his things in room 30,on the second floor.“I climbed up the stairs, located room 30 and let myself in with the key he hadgiven me. It was an ordinary hotel room,” remembers Dolibois, “with rather noisywallpaper.” Inside, the fancy light fixtures and plush furniture of a grandhotel had been replaced by a folding table, two chairs, and an army cot.Dolibois unpacked his duffel bag. There was a knock on the door.Ashcan may have been heavily fortified on the exterior, but inside the facility,the prisoners were free to roam around. Dolibois opened the door and stoodface-to-face with a large man dressed in a ratty pearl-gray uniform with goldbraids on the collars and gold insignia on the shoulder pads. He held a pair oftrousers draped over one arm. Clicking his heels, he nodded and introducedhimself as if he were at a party, not in a prison. The man opened his mouth andbarked, “Göring, Reichsmarschall!”So this was Hermann Göring. Dolibois recognized him immediately from so manyscreenings of Triumph of the Will. Here was the man in flesh and blood. Göringwas arguably the most notorious of Hitler’s inner circle still alive. Formercommander in chief of the Luftwaffe. Director of the Four Year Plan. Hitler’slong-acknowledged successor until the perceived betrayal at the very end. It wasHermann Göring who ordered security police chief Reinhard Heydrich to organizeand coordinate plans for a “solution to the Jewish question[endnotes.xhtml#en0439].”“At once I understood [endnotes.xhtml#en0440] my assignment,” recalled Dolibois.He was here in Luxembourg to interrogate the highest-ranking war criminals inthe Nazi Party. This was not a Nazi propaganda film. The individuals who had sopopulated his mind and his teaching at Camp Ritchie for the past eight monthswere right here. And they were all prisoners now.Göring stood before Dolibois, panting.Göring said he had been unfairly tricked by his captors. “He had been told[endnotes.xhtml#en0441] he was going to a palatial spa,” Dolibois explained.When Göring arrived at Ashcan with his valet, Robert Kropp, he was expecting avacation. He brought along eleven suitcases and twenty thousand Paracodin pills,and had made sure his toenails and fingernails had been varnished[endnotes.xhtml#en0442] to a bright red shine for his stay. That the spa atMondorf had lost its chandeliers and been turned into a maximum-security prisoncomplex was not what Göring had in mind. His mattress was made of straw, Göringbarked at Dolibois. He didn’t have a pillow. A man of his rank deserved more.Dolibois looked at Göring. Made a mental note.“Are you by chance a welfare officer who will see to it that we are treatedcorrectly, according to Articles of War?” Göring asked Dolibois.In this question, Dolibois saw opportunity as an interrogator. “Yes,” he said[endnotes.xhtml#en0443]. He would be working “along those lines.” Göring waspleased. “He made a great show again of heel-clicking, bowing and taking his 280pounds out of my room.”Göring returned to his fellow prisoners. He told the other Nazis about the newofficer’s arrival and his responsibilities to see better treatment for all ofthem. Suddenly everyone wanted to speak with First Lieutenant John Dolibois.CCPWE No. 32 was filled with Nazi “Bonzen,” the big wheels, as Dolibois and theother interrogators called them. Hans Frank, the “Jew-Butcher of Cracow,”arrived at Ashcan on a stretcher, in silk pajamas drenched in blood. He hadtried to kill himself by slashing his own throat. Frank was captured with histhirty-eight-volume diary, written during the war, a damning confession of manycrimes he was guilty of. “Dark-eyed and balding,” noted Ashcan’s commandant[endnotes.xhtml#en0444], Colonel Burton Andrus, Frank had “pale hairy hands.”Other prisoners included members of the former German General Staff: FieldMarshal Wilhelm Keitel, chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW), or ArmedForces High Command; General Alfred Jodl, Keitel’s chief of operations; GrandAdmiral Karl Dönitz, commander of submarines and commander in chief of theGerman navy; Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, former chief of Armed Forces Italyand later Supreme Commander West; Joachim von Ribbentrop, foreign minister; andAlbert Speer, minister of armaments and war production. These were the men whopersonally helped Hitler plan and execute World War II and the Holocaust—thosewho hadn’t escaped, perished, or committed suicide [endnotes.xhtml#en0445].“In a second circle [endnotes.xhtml#en0446], or clique, there were the real Nazigangsters,” Dolibois explained, “the old fighters—who had been with Hitler atthe beginning of his rise to power.” Among this group were Robert Ley, LaborFront leader; Julius Streicher, editor of the anti-Semitic newspaper andpropaganda tool Der Stürmer; Alfred Rosenberg, Nazi philosopher; ArthurSeyss-Inquart, the man who betrayed Austria and became Reichskommissar ofHolland; and Wilhelm Frick, former minister of the interior and Reichsprotektorof Bohemia-Moravia.Stripped of their power, small details spoke volumes to Dolibois. Göring wasterrified of thunderstorms. Keitel was obsessed with sunbathing and staring athis reflection in Ashcan’s only mirror, in its entrance hall. Robert Ley wasrepeatedly reprimanded for masturbating in the bathtub [endnotes.xhtml#en0447].Joachim von Ribbentrop, named by the Nazi Ministry of Propaganda as thebest-dressed man in Germany for nine consecutive years, was a lazy slob. Day inand day out, John Dolibois interviewed them.“Almost all the men at Ashcan were eager to talk,” Dolibois recalls. “They feltneglected if they hadn’t been interrogated by someone for several days.… Theirfavorite pastime was casting blame.” The greatest challenge for Dolibois and hisfellow interrogators was determining, or trying to determine, who was lying andwho was telling the truth. “Cross-examination. Playing one prisoner off theother,” according to Dolibois, was a tactic that worked best.“Often, I was taken [endnotes.xhtml#en0448] into their confidence when theyneeded a shoulder to cry on,” Dolibois explains. “At Mondorf, they stillcouldn’t believe they would be tried for their crimes.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter009]HITLER’S CHEMISTS [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter009]At war’s end, the staff of the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service had their sightsset on bringing Hitler’s chemists to the United States. The service sawunbridled potential in making the Nazis’ nerve agent program its own and waswilling to go to great lengths to obtain its secrets. Less than one month afterBritish tanks rolled into the Robbers’ Lair and found the enormous cache oftabun-filled bombs in the forests of Münster-Nord, the Chemical Warfare Servicehad obtained a sample of the nerve agent and was analyzing its properties[endnotes.xhtml#en0449] in its Development Laboratory in the United States. Workbegan on May 15, 1945, and took two weeks to complete. The analysis revealedthat tabun was a revolutionary killer that could decimate enemy armies. GeneralWilliam N. Porter, chief of the Chemical Warfare Service, requested that five260-kg tabun-filled bombs be shipped from the Robbers’ Lair to the United States“by air under highest priority [endnotes.xhtml#en0450]” for field tests.Separately, General Porter asked the U.S. Army Air Forces and U.S. Army Ordnanceto conduct their own feasibility studies to determine if tabun bombs could beused in combat by U.S. troops.Most people looked upon chemical warfare as abhorrent. In a June 1943 speech,President Roosevelt himself had said that using chemicals to kill people[endnotes.xhtml#en0451] was immoral and inhumane. The president had deniedChemical Warfare Service officials their request to change the service’s name tothe Chemical Corps because of the permanence the name change suggested. And yethere was the interesting news for the Chemical Service. When German nerve gasentered into the world of chemical warfare, it brought with it the assurance ofa U.S. chemical warfare program in peacetime. According to chemical weaponsexpert Jonathan B. Tucker, “In 1945, in the aftermath [endnotes.xhtml#en0452] ofWorld War II, the U.S. Army Chemical Warfare Service decided to focus itsresearch and development efforts on the German nerve agents, the technologicalchallenges of which promised to ensure the organization’s survival through theperiod of postwar demobilization and declining military budgets.” Within severalmonths of the German surrender, 530 tons of tabun [endnotes.xhtml#en0453] nerveagent were shipped to the United States and used in Top Secret field tests.Requests to bring German chemists to the United States for weapons work quicklyfollowed. But, as had been the case with the V-2 rocket scientists, the notionof issuing visas to Hitler’s chemists was met with hostility inside the StateDepartment. When the chief of the State Department’s Passport Division, HowardK. Travers, learned about this idea, he sent his colleagues an internal memostating, “We should do everything [endnotes.xhtml#en0454] we consistently can toprevent German chemists and others from entering this country.”In Germany, Alsos scientific director Samuel Goudsmit had been tracking Hitler’schemists ever since the Allies crossed the Rhine. Likewise, the CIOS chemicalweapons team, led by Lieutenant Colonel Philip R. Tarr of the U.S. ChemicalWarfare Service and his British counterpart Major Edmund Tilley, were continuingtheir relentless pursuit. When Alsos located the chemist Richard Kuhn at theKaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg, they paid him avisit. Kuhn had once been an internationally revered organic chemist, but rumorhad it that he had become an ardent Nazi during the war. Kuhn won the NobelPrize in Chemistry in 1938 but turned down accepting the award at the request ofHitler, who called it a Jewish prize. Here now to interview Richard Kuhn, SamuelGoudsmit had with him two American chemists, Louis Fieser of Harvard and CarlBaumann of the University of Wisconsin. Both men had actually worked with Kuhnin his laboratory before the war. After a cordial exchange of greetings, theinterrogation began. Alsos sought information regarding the Third Reich’s nerveagent program. What did Herr Kuhn know?Kuhn, with his mop of straight reddish-brown hair, cunning smile, and schoolboylooks, swore that he had no connection whatsoever with Reich military research.He told his former colleagues [endnotes.xhtml#en0455] that he was a purescientist, an academic who spent the war working on the chemistry of moderndrugs. Samuel Goudsmit had his doubts. “Richard Kuhn’s record did not seem tooclean to me,” Goudsmit recalled after the war. “As president of the GermanChemical Society he had followed the Nazi cult and rites quite faithfully. Henever failed to give the Hitler salute when starting his classes and to shout‘Siegheil’ like a true Nazi [endnotes.xhtml#en0456] leader,” Goudsmit recalled.But the Alsos leader did not have enough evidence to have Kuhn arrested, so heput him under surveillance instead.Elsewhere in Germany, CIOS chemical weapons investigators Colonel Tarr and MajorTilley had been rounding up German chemists and sending them to prisoner-of-warfacilities near where the individual arrests had taken place. Starting on June1, 1945, these chemists would now be sent to a single location—a Top Secretinterrogation facility outside Frankfurt. SHAEF was moving its headquarters fromVersailles to Frankfurt and was to be dissolved in mid-July. The neworganization in charge of all affairs, including scientific exploitation, wasthe Office of Military Government for Germany (OMGUS), whose commander wasEisenhower’s deputy General Lucius D. Clay. The Allies were also reorganizing[endnotes.xhtml#en0457] the way in which scientific intelligence was going to becollected moving forward. CIOS was transitioning into American and Britishcomponents: FIAT (Field Information Agency, Technical) and BIOS (BritishIntelligence Objectives Sub-committee). CIOS teams would remain active whilethey completed open investigations.The structure that housed this new interrogation center was none other thanSchloss Kransberg, or Kransberg Castle, Hermann Göring’s former Luftwaffeheadquarters and the place where Albert Speer and his aide spent the night thelast New Year’s Eve of the war. The Allies gave it the code-name Dustbin. Thismedieval structure built high in the Taunus Mountains had grand rooms, hardwoodfloors, beautiful stone fireplaces, and shiny chandeliers. These were hardlygulag-type quarters. In terms of security classification, Dustbin was top-tier.The facility was the second-most classified interrogation center after Ashcan.Dustbin was self-contained [endnotes.xhtml#en0458] inside its centuries-oldstone walls, and, as it went at Ashcan, the prisoners here were free to roam thegrounds and chat among themselves. Karl Brandt, Hitler’s doctor, organizedmorning gymnastics classes in the garden. Others played chess. Industrialistsheld lectures in the large banquet hall that Göring had once used as a casino.Speer took walks [endnotes.xhtml#en0459] in the castle’s apple orchard, almostalways alone by choice. Whereas Ashcan housed the Nazi high command, Dustbin hadmany Nazi scientists, doctors, and industrialists under guard. This includedmore than twenty chemists with IG Farben and at least six members of its board.Throughout the early summer of 1945, several key players in Farben’s tabun gasprogram were still at large. For Major Tilley, the chronology regarding howFarben first began producing nerve gas and how it transformed into wide-scaleproduction remained a mystery until a Farben chemist named Dr. Gerhard Schraderwas captured and brought to Dustbin. Schrader was the man who created the nerveagent that had been found at Raubkammer, the Robbers’ Lair. The informationSchrader had was among the most sought-after classified military intelligence inthe world. Tilley prepared for intense stonewalling from the Farben chemist.Instead Dr. Schrader spoke freely, offering up everything he knew, beginningwith tabun’s startling discovery in the fall of 1936.Dr. Schrader had been working [endnotes.xhtml#en0460] at an insecticide lab forIG Farben in Leverkusen, north of Cologne, for several years. By the fall of1936, he had an important job on his hands. Weevils and leaf lice weredestroying grain across Germany, and Schrader was tasked with creating asynthetic pesticide that could eradicate these tiny pests. The government hadbeen spending thirty million reichsmarks a year on pesticides made by Farben aswell as other companies. IG Farben wanted to develop [endnotes.xhtml#en0461] aninsect killer that could save money for the Reich and earn the company amonopoly on pesticides.Synthesizing organic, carbon-based compounds was trial-and-error work, Dr.Schrader told Major Tilley. It was labor-intensive and dangerous. Schrader, afamily man, took excellent precautions against exposure, always working under afume hood. Even trace amounts of the chemicals he was using had cumulative,potentially lethal effects. Schrader suffered from frequent headaches andsometimes felt short of breath. One night, while driving home after working on anew product, Schrader could barely see the road in front of him. When he pulledover to examine his eyes in the mirror, he saw that his pupils had constrictedto the size of a pinhead. Over the next several days his vision grew worse. Hedeveloped a throbbing pressure in his larynx. Finally, Schrader checked himselfinto a hospital, where he was monitored for two weeks before being sent home andtold to rest.Eight days after the respite, Schrader returned to work. He had been developinga cyanide-containing fumigant, which he had given the code name Preparation9/91. Picking up where he’d left off with his work, he prepared a small amountof his new substance, diluting it to 1 in 200,000 units to see if it would killlice clinging to leaves. He was stunned when his new creation killed 100 percentof the lice. Schrader repeated the experiment for his colleagues. They allagreed that Preparation 9/91 was a hundred times more lethal than anythinganyone at the Leverkusen lab had ever worked with before.Dr. Schrader sent a sample of this lethal new fumigant to Farben’s director ofindustrial hygiene, a man named Professor Eberhard Gross (not to be confusedwith Dr. Karl Gross, the Waffen-SS bacteriologist connected with the Gerabergdiscovery). Gross tested the substance on apes and was duly shocked by theresults. After a healthy ape was injected with a tiny amount of Preparation9/91—just 1/10th of a milligram per kilo of body weight—the ape died in lessthan an hour. Next, Gross tested the substance on an ape inside an inhalationchamber. He watched this healthy ape die in sixteen minutes. Professor Grosstold Dr. Schrader that his Preparation 9/91 was being sent to Berlin and that heshould wait for further instruction on what action to take next.At Dustbin, Schrader told Major Tilley that when he learned his compound couldkill a healthy ape through airborne contact in minutes, he became upset. Hisdiscovery was never going to be used as an insecticide, Schrader lamented. Itwas simply too dangerous for any warm-blooded animal or human to come intocontact with. Schrader said his goal was to save money for the Reich. With thenews of how powerful Preparation 9/91 was, Schrader felt he’d failed at his job.He got back to work, searching for a fumigant better suited for the task ofkilling weevils and leaf lice.Meanwhile, Professor Gross brought the substance to his superiors. Starting in1935, a Reich ordinance required all new discoveries with potential militaryapplication [endnotes.xhtml#en0462] to be reported to the War Office. TheReich’s Chemical Weapons Department began to evaluate Schrader’s Preparation9/91 for its potential use in chemical warfare. In May 1937 Schrader was invitedto Berlin to demonstrate how he’d synthesized Preparation 9/91. “Everyone wasastounded [endnotes.xhtml#en0463],” Schrader told Tilley. This was the mostpromising chemical killer since the Germans invented mustard gas. Preparation9/91 was classified Top Secret and given a code name: tabun gas. It came fromthe English word “taboo,” [endnotes.xhtml#en0464] something prohibited orforbidden.Dr. Schrader was told [endnotes.xhtml#en0465] to produce one kilogram for theGerman army, which would take over tabun production on a massive scale. Schradergot a bonus of 50,000 reichsmarks (the average German worker during this timeperiod earned 3,100 reichsmarks a year) and was told to get back to work. Farbenstill needed him to develop a lice-killing insecticide.With their new nerve agent tabun, Farben executives saw all kinds of businessopportunities. Karl Krauch, the head of Farben’s board of directors, beganworking with Hermann Göring on a longer-range plan to arm Germany with chemicalweapons, ones that could eventually be dropped on the enemy from airplanes. Inhis report to Göring [endnotes.xhtml#en0466], Krauch called tabun “the weapon ofsuperior intelligence and superior scientific-technological thinking.” Thebeauty in the nerve agent, Krauch told Göring, was that it could be “usedagainst the enemy’s hinterland.” Göring agreed, adding that what he liked mostabout chemical weapons was that they terrified people. He responded to Krauch inwriting, noting that the deadly effects of nerve agents like tabun gas couldwreak “psychological havoc on civilian populations [endnotes.xhtml#en0467],driving them crazy with fear.”On August 22, 1938, Göring named Karl Krauch his Plenipotentiary for SpecialQuestions of Chemical Production. Farben was now positioned to build the Reich’schemical weapons industry from the ground up. The Treaty of Versailles hadforced Germany to destroy all its chemical weapons factories after World War I,which meant factories had to be secretly built. This was an enormousundertaking, now an official part of the Nazis’ secret Four Year Plan, andthrough Krauch IG Farben was made privy to the Reich’s war plan before war wasdeclared.At the Dustbin interrogation center, Major Tilley asked Schrader aboutfull-scale production. Based on the Allies’ discovery of thousands of tons oftabun bombs in the forests outside Raubkammer, Farben must have had an enormoussecret production facility somewhere. Dr. Schrader said that he was not involvedin full-scale production. That was the job of his colleague, Dr. Otto Ambros.Major Tilley asked Schrader to tell him more about Ambros. Schrader said thatmost of what Ambros did [endnotes.xhtml#en0468] was classified but that if MajorTilley wanted to know more about what he actually did for Farben, Tilley shouldtalk to individuals who sat on Farben’s board of directors with Ambros, eitherDr. Karl Krauch or Baron Georg von Schnitzler. Both men were interned here atDustbin.“Who is Mr. Ambros? [endnotes.xhtml#en0469]” Major Tilley asked Baron Georg vonSchnitzler, in an interview that would later be presented as evidence in aNuremberg war crimes trial.“He is one of our first, younger technicians,” von Schnitzler said. “He was incharge of Dyhernfurt [sic] as well as Auschwitz and Gendorg [sic].”Where was Ambros now? Tilley asked von Schnitzler. The baron told Major Tilleyto talk to Karl Krauch.From Krauch, Major Tilley learned quite a bit more [endnotes.xhtml#en0470] aboutAmbros. That he had been in charge of technical development of chemical weaponsproduction at Gendorf and at Dyhernfurth. That Gendorf produced mustard gas onan industrial scale, and that Dyhernfurth produced tabun. Krauch also revealed anew piece of evidence. Dyhernfurth produced a second nerve agent, one that waseven more potent than tabun, called sarin. Sarin was an acronym pieced togetherfrom the names of four key persons involved in its development: Schrader andAmbros from IG Farben and, from the German army, two officers named Rüdiger andLinde. Krauch told Major Tilley that the Dyhernfurth plant had fallen intoRussian hands.Karl Krauch said something else that caught Major Tilley by surprise. Beforecoming to Dustbin, Krauch said he had been in the hospital, where he’d been paida visit by two American officers, one of whom was Lieutenant Colonel Tarr.“Judging from conversations [endnotes.xhtml#en0471] I had a few months ago inthe hospital with members of the USSBS [Colonel Snow] and Chemical Warfare[Colonel Tarr],” Krauch explained, “the gentlemen seemed mostly interested insarin and tabun; they asked me for construction plans and details offabrication. As far as I understood they intended to erect similar plants in theU.S.A. I told them to apply to Dr. Ambros and his staff at Gendorf.”Major Tilley was shocked. Lieutenant Colonel Tarr was his CIOS partner, and yetTarr had neglected to share with him the story about visiting Krauch in thehospital. This was Tilley’s first indication that Tarr was running a separatemission for the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service, one that apparently had adifferent objective than the CIOS mission. The full, dramatic story was about tounfold.By June 1945, Otto Ambros had been questioned by soldiers with the Third Armynumerous times. For reasons that remain obscure, no one from that division hadbeen informed of the fact that Ambros was wanted for war crimes, or that he hadserved as Farben’s chief of chemical weapons production throughout Hitler’srule. To the Third Army he was simply the “plain chemist[endnotes.xhtml#en0472]” in the Bavarian village of Gendorf, the smiling,well-dressed businessman who supplied American soldiers with free bars of soap.At Dustbin, Major Tilley relayed this critical new information about Dr. OttoAmbros to his FIAT superiors, who in turn sent an urgent message to the SixthArmy Group, also in Gendorf, ordering the immediate arrest of Dr. Ambros. TheSixth Army was to transport Ambros directly to Dustbin so that Major Tilleycould interrogate him. A note card was placed in Ambros’s dossier. Disparatebits of information were now coming into sharp focus. “Case #21877. Dr. OttoAmbros [endnotes.xhtml#en0473]. Rumored to have been involved in use ofconcentration camp personnel for testing effectiveness of new poison gasesdeveloped at Gendorf.”CROWCASS notified SHAEF, insisting that Dr. Ambros be arrested. As the plantmanager at Farben’s Buna factory at Auschwitz, Otto Ambros had been linked toatrocities including mass murder and slavery. The Sixth Army Group swung intoaction. But when they arrived at Ambros’s home in Gendorf, arrest orders inhand, Ambros was gone.The first assumption was that Ambros had fled on his own. This proved incorrect.He had been taken away by Lieutenant Colonel Philip Tarr. Initially, thecommanding officer at Dustbin found this impossible to comprehend[endnotes.xhtml#en0474]. It was one thing for Tarr to try to interview Ambrosbefore any other chemical warfare experts did. That kind of rivalry had beengoing on ever since the various scientific intelligence teams had crossed theRhine. But why would Tarr defy orders from SHAEF to have Ambros arrested? Whilesoldiers with the Sixth Army stood scratching their heads in Gendorf, Tarr andAmbros were actually headed to Heidelberg in a U.S. Army jeep. Their destinationwas an American interrogation center [endnotes.xhtml#en0475] that was run byarmy intelligence officers with the Chemical Warfare Service. For days, no oneat Dustbin had any idea where Tarr and Ambros had gone.Otto Ambros had a razor-sharp mind. He was cunning and congenial, sly like afox. He almost always wore a grin. The American war crimes prosecutor JosiahDuBois described him as having a “devilish friendliness” about him. He also hada distracting, rabbitlike habit of sniffing at the air [endnotes.xhtml#en0476].Ambros was short and heavyset, with white hair and flat feet. He was a brilliantscientist who studied chemistry and agronomy under Nobel Prize winner RichardWillstätter, a Jew. As a chemist, Ambros had a mind that was capable of pushingscience into realms previously unexplored. Few men were as important to IGFarben [endnotes.xhtml#en0477] during the war as Otto Ambros had been.IG Farben first began producing synthetic rubber in 1935, naming it Buna afterits primary component, butadiene [endnotes.xhtml#en0478]. In 1937 Farbenpresented commercial Buna on the world stage and won the gold medal at theInternational Expo in Paris. When Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, theReich’s ability to import natural rubber diminished. Demand for a syntheticalternative skyrocketed, a fact Farben was well aware of in advance of Germany’sattack. Tanks needed treads, aircraft needed tires, and Farben needed to producerubber. Hitler directed Farben to increase its Buna production further. Dr.Ambros was put in charge and saw to it that Farben opened a second and then athird Buna plant so that supply could meet demand. As the invasion of the SovietUnion was secretly conceived by the German high command, Hitler again calledupon Farben’s board of directors to increase its synthetic rubber production.Farben needed to construct a massive new Buna factory. Otto Ambros was put incharge of masterminding this undertaking [endnotes.xhtml#en0479] as well. Theplace chosen was Auschwitz.Once, Auschwitz was a regular town. “Ordinary people lived there, and touristsvisited to see the castle, the churches, the large medieval market square, andthe synagogue,” write historians Debórah Dwork and Robert Jan van Pelt. In the1930s, visitors sent postcards from the area that read “Greetings from Auschwitz[endnotes.xhtml#en0480].” When, in the fall of 1940, Otto Ambros pored over mapsof this region, called Upper Silesia, in search of a Buna factory site, he foundwhat he was looking for. The production of synthetic rubber required[endnotes.xhtml#en0481] four things: water, flat land, good railway connections,and an abundance of laborers. Auschwitz had all four. Three rivers met inAuschwitz, the Sola, the Vistula, and the Przemsza, with a water flow of 525,000cubic feet per hour. The land was flat and sixty-five feet above the waterline,making it safe from floodwaters. The railway connections were sound. But mostimportant was the labor issue. The concentration camp next door could provide anendless labor supply because the men were cheap and could be worked to death.For Farben, the use of slave labor could take the company to levels of economicprowess previously unexplored. First, a financial deal had to be made with theSS. Ambros was instrumental in this act. For months, before the building of theBuna factory got the go-ahead, the SS and Farben haggled over deal points. Someof the paperwork survived the war. On November 8, 1940, the Reich’s minister ofeconomics wrote to Farben’s board of directors, requesting that they hurry upand “settle the question regarding [endnotes.xhtml#en0482] the site.” OttoAmbros lobbied hard for Auschwitz, and in December, IG Farben sent a busload ofits rubber experts and construction workers to survey the work site. A Farbenemployee named Erich Santo was assigned to serve as Otto Ambros’s constructionforeman.“The concentration camp already existing with approximately 7000 prisoners is tobe expanded,” Santo noted in his official company report[endnotes.xhtml#en0483]. For Ambros, Farben’s arrangement with the SS regardingslave laborers remained vague; Ambros sought clarity. “It is therefore necessary[endnotes.xhtml#en0484] to open negotiations with the Reich Leader SS [Himmler]as soon as possible in order to discuss necessary measures with him,” Ambroswrote in his official company report. The two men had a decades-oldrelationship; Heinrich Himmler and Otto Ambros had known one another since gradeschool. Ambros could make Himmler see eye-to-eye with him on the benefits thatAuschwitz offered to both Farben and the SS.In fact, the SS and IG Farben needed one another. Himmler wanted Farben’sresources at Auschwitz and was eager to make the deal to supply the slaves, soSS officers hosted a dinner party [endnotes.xhtml#en0485] for Farben’s rubberand construction experts at the Auschwitz concentration camp, inside an SSbanquet hall there. During the festivities, the remaining issues were finallyagreed upon. Farben would pay [endnotes.xhtml#en0486] the SS three reichsmarks aday for each laborer they supplied, which would go into the SS treasury, not tothe slaves. “On the occasion of a dinner party given for us by the management ofthe concentration camp, we furthermore determined all the arrangements relatingto the involvement of the really excellent concentration-camp operation insupport of the Buna plants,” Ambros wrote to his boss, Fritz Ter Meer, on April12, 1941. “Our new friendship with the SS [endnotes.xhtml#en0487] is provingvery profitable,” Ambros explained.The SS agreed to provide Farben with one thousand slave workers immediately.That number, promised Himmler, could quickly rise to thirty thousand withdemand. The relationship between Farben and the SS at Auschwitz was nowcemented. Otto Ambros was the key to making the Buna factory a success. With hisknowledge of synthetic rubber and his managerial experience—he also ran Farben’ssecret nerve gas production facilities—there was no better man than Otto Ambrosfor the Auschwitz job.Major Tilley waited at Dustbin for the return of Tarr and Ambros. It was nowclear to him that there was no single individual more important to Hitler’schemical weapons program than Otto Ambros had been. Ambros was in charge ofchemical weapons at Gendorf and Dyhernfurth, and he was the manager of the Bunafactory at Auschwitz. From interviewing various Farben chemists held at Dustbin,Tilley had also learned that the gas used to murder millions of people atAuschwitz and other concentration camps, Zyklon B, was a Farben product. Farbenowned the patent on Zyklon B, and it was sold to the Reich by an IG Farbencompany. In one of these interviews, Tilley asked IG Farben board member BaronGeorg von Schnitzler if Otto Ambros knew that Farben chemicals were being usedto murder people.“You said yesterday [endnotes.xhtml#en0488] that a [Farben employee] ‘alluded’to you that the poisonous gasses [sic] and the chemicals manufactured by IGFarben were being used for the murder of human beings held in concentrationcamps,” Major Tilley reminded von Schnitzler in their interview.“So I understood him,” von Schnitzler replied.“Didn’t you question those employees of yours further in regard to the use ofthese gases?”“They said they knew it was being used for this purpose,” von Schnitzler said.“What did you do when he told you that IG chemicals were being used to kill, tomurder people held in concentration camps?” Major Tilley asked.“I was horrified,” said von Schnitzler.“Did you do anything about it?”“I kept it for [sic] me because it was too terrible,” von Schnitzler confessed.“I asked [the Farben employee] is it known to you and Ambros and other directorsin Auschwitz that the gases and chemicals are being used to murder people?”“What did he say?” asked Major Tilley.“Yes; it is known to all the IG directors in Auschwitz [endnotes.xhtml#en0489],”von Schnitzler said.For Lieutenant Colonel Philip R. Tarr, there was a mission at hand. EnemyEquipment Intelligence Service Team Number One, which he served on, neededinformation that only Dr. Otto Ambros had. Specifically, the team neededblueprints for equipment necessary for producing tabun nerve gas.When Tarr and Ambros arrived in Heidelberg, the U.S. Chemical Warfare Servicehad another IG Farben chemist in custody whom they wanted Ambros to work with ona classified job. The man is referred to in documents only as Herr Stumpfi.Ambros and Stumpfi were told to drive to a special metals firm located in Hanau,where they were to locate “30 or 40 drawings [endnotes.xhtml#en0490] ofsilver-lined equipment.” The Chemical Warfare Service trusted Ambros[endnotes.xhtml#en0491] to such a degree that they sent him and Stumpfi on thismission without an escort.Manufacturing tabun gas was a precise and clandestine process. The United Statesdesperately wanted to reproduce it, but attempting to do so without Farben’sproprietary formula and its secret equipment was a potential death sentence forany chemists involved. Farben had spent millions of reichsmarks on research anddevelopment. Hundreds of concentration camp workers [endnotes.xhtml#en0492] haddied in this trial-and-error process. When the U.S. Chemical Warfare Servicelearned that the silver-lined equipment used to manufacture tabun gas on a largescale had been outsourced from a special metals firm called Heraus, they covetedthose blueprints and plans. Dr. Ambros and Herr Stumpfi were to go to thisengineering firm to locate these drawings and blueprints and bring them back toHeidelberg. The Chemical Warfare Service agents could not conduct this missionon their own because they had no idea what equipment to look for.The two Farben chemists, Ambros and Stumpfi, set off on their secret assignment.“When they arrived at the factory in Hanau, personnel of a [U.S.] CIC [CounterIntelligence Corps] group with headquarters at that time in Hanau, arrestedthem,” read a secret report. “When they explained their mission the CICpersonnel [endnotes.xhtml#en0493] concerned confirmed the German engineers’statement by communication with Heidelberg and the two Germans were released.”Ambros and Stumpfi drove away. “The CIC personnel, concerned [after] havinglearned of the drawings through the two German engineers, then seized thedrawings and took them to their own headquarters,” read a classified Armyreport. The Chemical Warfare Service never obtained the drawings they werelooking for. But at least Tarr had Dr. Ambros under his control, or so hebelieved.Instead, somewhere between Ambros’s release from the Heraus engineering firm inHanau and his return to Heidelberg, he was able to communicate to his “networkof spies [endnotes.xhtml#en0494] and informants in Gendorf.” From those sources,Ambros learned that soldiers with the U.S. Sixth Army had an order to arresthim. So instead of returning to Tarr’s custody, Ambros drove to a fancyguesthouse that IG Farben maintained [endnotes.xhtml#en0495] outside Heidelbergcalled Villa Kohlhof, where a staff of Farben employees tended to his everyneed.CIOS and FIAT officials from Dustbin finally made contact with Tarr and orderedhim to return with Ambros to the interrogation facility immediately. But Tarrwas no longer in control of Ambros. Major Tilley went looking for Ambros himselfand found Hitler’s chemist residing at Villa Kohlhof [endnotes.xhtml#en0496].Ambros told Major Tilley that he would agree to continue cooperating with theU.S. Chemical Warfare Service and the various Allied agencies that soughtinformation from him, but only on one condition: that Tilley “secure the releaseof all chemical warfare personnel already detained at Dustbin.” This was apreposterous request.Tilley’s superior, Major P. M. Wilson of FIAT’s Enemy Personnel ExploitationSection, attempted to take control of the situation, ordering Ambros brought toDustbin immediately. This was not a matter of cooperation, Wilson said. Therewere orders to arrest the man. Lieutenant Colonel Tarr intervened on Ambros’sbehalf. He lobbied the British Ministry of Supply (the agency responsible forBritish chemical warfare issues) for help getting Ambros’s Dustbin colleaguesreleased. To Tarr, extracting Ambros’s esoteric knowledge outweighed the need tohold him accountable for his crimes. But the British also flatly refused to helpTarr. The matter stalled.Lieutenant Colonel Tarr flew to Paris. That night, a telegram arrived atDustbin, sent from Paris and purporting to be from the British Ministry ofSupply. The telegram ordered the release of all Farben chemical warfarescientists at Dustbin, and was signed by a British Ministry of Supply colonelnamed J. T. M. Childs. Officers at Dustbin suspected that something was amiss[endnotes.xhtml#en0497] and contacted Colonel Childs about his outrageousrequest. Colonel Childs swore he had neither written the memo nor signed it andaccused Lieutenant Colonel Tarr of forgery.FIAT enhanced their efforts to have Dr. Ambros arrested in Heidelberg. Theefforts failed. Ambros was able to evade capture by fleeing into the safety ofthe French zone. Double-crossing Lieutenant Colonel Tarr, Otto Ambros struck adeal with French chemical weapons experts. In exchange for information, he wasgiven a job as plant manager [endnotes.xhtml#en0498] at Farben’s chemicalfactory in Ludwigshafen.When FIAT officers at Dustbin learned what had happened, they were outraged.Ambros’s escape had been entirely preventable. “It is evident that he was notkept in custody or under house arrest,” noted Captain R. E. F. Edelsten, aBritish officer with the Ministry of Supply. Major P. M. Wilson saw thesituation in much darker terms [endnotes.xhtml#en0499]. Lieutenant Colonel Tarrhad “taken steps to assist [Ambros] to evade arrest,” he wrote in a scathingreport. Wilson was appalled by “the friendly treatment being given to this manwho is suspected of war criminality.” But these were just words. Ambros was nowa free man, living and working in the French zone.The relationship among Tarr, Ambros, and the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service wasfar from over. It was only a matter of time before an American chemical companywould learn of the army’s interest in a whole new field of chemical weapons. AnAmerican chemist, Dr. Wilhelm Hirschkind, was in Germany at this same time. Dr.Hirschkind was conducting a survey of the German chemical industry for the U.S.Chemical Warfare Service while on temporary leave from the Dow Chemical Company.Dr. Hirschkind had spent several months inspecting IG Farben plants in the U.S.and British zones and now he was in Heidelberg, hoping to meet Ambros.Lieutenant Colonel Tarr reached out to Colonel Weiss, the French commander incharge of IG Farben’s chemical plant in Ludwigshafen, and a meeting wasarranged.On July 28, 1945, Dr. Hirschkind met with Dr. Ambros and Lieutenant Colonel Tarrin Heidelberg. Ambros brought his wartime deputy with him to the meeting, theFarben chemist Jürgen von Klenck. It was von Klenck who, in the final months ofthe war, had helped Ambros destroy evidence, hide documents, and disguise theFarben factory in Gendorf so that it appeared to produce soap, not chemicalweapons. Jürgen von Klenck was initially detained at Dustbin but later released.The Heidelberg meetings lasted several days. When Dr. Wilhelm Hirschkind left,he had these words for Ambros: “I would look forward [endnotes.xhtml#en0500]after the conclusion of the peace treaty [to] continuing our relations [in myposition] as a representative of Dow.”Only later did FIAT interrogators learn about this meeting. Major Tilley’ssuspicions were now confirmed. A group inside the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service,including his former partner, Lieutenant Colonel Tarr, did indeed have anulterior motive that ran counter to the motives of CIOS, FIAT, and the UnitedNations War Crimes Commission. Tilley’s superior at Dustbin, Major Wilson,confirmed this dark and disturbing truth in a classified military intelligencereport on the Ambros affair. “It is believed [endnotes.xhtml#en0501] that theconflict between FIAT… and Lt-Col Tarr was due to the latter’s wish to useAmbros for industrial chemical purposes” back in the United States.All documents regarding the Ambros affair would remain classified for the nextforty years, until August of 1985. That an officer of the U.S. Chemical WarfareService, Lieutenant Colonel Tarr, had sheltered a wanted war criminal fromcapture in the aftermath of the German surrender was damning. That this officerwas also participating in meetings with the fugitive and a representative fromthe Dow Chemical Company was scandalous.In 1945, the Chemical Warfare Service was also in charge of the U.S. biologicalweapons program, the existence of which remained secret from the Americanpublic. The program was robust; if the atomic bomb failed to end the war inJapan, there were plans in motion to wage biological warfare against Japanesecrops. After the fall of the Reich, the staff of the Chemical Warfare Servicebegan interrogating Hitler’s biological weapons makers, many of whom wereinterned at Dustbin. The Chemical Warfare Service saw enormous potential inmaking the Nazis’ biological weapons program its own and sought any scientificintelligence it could get. The man most wanted in this effort was Hitler’s topbiological weapons expert, Dr. Kurt Blome.On June 29, 1945, Blome was sent to Dustbin. The officers assigned tointerrogate him were Bill Cromartie and J. M. Barnes of Operation Alsos. Eachman was uniquely familiar with Blome’s background. Cromartie had been in Dr.Eugen Haagen’s apartment in Strasbourg in November 1944 when he and Alsosscientific director Samuel Goudsmit made the awful discovery that the Reich hadbeen experimenting on people during the war (Blome was named in the Haagenfiles). And it was Cromartie and Barnes who led the investigation of theGeraberg facility, the abandoned, curious-looking research outpost hidden in theThuringian Forest. Both Cromartie and Barnes had concluded that Geraberg hadbeen a laboratory for Reich biological weapons research and that Dr. Blome wasin charge.During his initial interview at Dustbin [endnotes.xhtml#en0502], Blome refusedto cooperate. “When he was first interrogated, he was very evasive,” Cromartieand Barnes wrote. But a few days later, when interrogated in more detail,Blome’s “attitude changed completely and he seemed anxious to give a fullaccount not only [of] what he actually did but what he had in mind for futurework.” Cromartie and Barnes were unsure if they should be enthused by Blome’sseeming change of heart or suspicious of it. Blome had been observed[endnotes.xhtml#en0503] in the Dustbin eating hall conversing at length with Dr.Heinrich Kliewe, the Reich’s counterintelligence agent for bacterial warfareconcerns. Perhaps the two men were concocting a misinformation scheme.During the war, Dr. Kliewe’s job had been to monitor bioweapons progress beingmade by Germany’s enemies, most notably Russia. “Kliewe claims[endnotes.xhtml#en0504] that he himself did all the evaluating of the reportsreceived and determined what course of action his department should thenceforthfollow,” investigators wrote in Kliewe’s Dustbin dossier. Kliewe told Blome thathe would likely be taken to Heidelberg for a lengthy interrogation with Alsosagents, as Kliewe had been.If Cromartie and Barnes were surprised by Blome’s sudden willingness to talk,they were also aware that most of what he told them [endnotes.xhtml#en0505]could not be independently verified. “It is quite impossible to check many ofhis statements and what follows is an account of what he related,” read a notein Blome’s Dustbin dossier. What Blome recounted was a dark tale of plans forbiological warfare spearheaded by Heinrich Himmler.Himmler had a layman’s fascination with biological warfare. A former chickenfarmer, the Reichsführer-SS had studied agriculture in school. According toBlome, it was Himmler who was the primary motivator behind the Reich’sbioweapons program. Hitler, Blome said, did not approve of biological warfareand was kept in the dark as to specific plans [endnotes.xhtml#en0506]. Himmler’sarea of greatest fascination, said Blome, was bubonic plague.On April 30, 1943, Göring had created the cancer research post that was to beheld by Blome. Over the next nineteen months, Blome explained, he met withHimmler five times.At their first meeting, which occurred in the summer of 1943—Blome recalled itas being July or August—Himmler ordered Blome to study various disseminationmethods of plague bacteria for offensive warfare. According to Blome, he sharedwith Himmler his fears regarding the dangerous boomerang effect a plague bombwould most likely have on Germany. Himmler told Blome that in that case, heshould get to work immediately to produce a vaccine to prevent such a thing. Toexpedite vaccine research, Blome said, Himmler ordered him[endnotes.xhtml#en0507] “to use human beings.”Himmler offered Blome a medical block at a concentration camp like Dachau wherehe could complete this work. Blome said he told Himmler he was aware of “strongobjections in certain circles” to using humans in experimental vaccine trials.Himmler told Blome that experimenting on humans was necessary in the war effort.To refuse was “the equivalent of treason.”Very well, said Blome. He considered himself a loyal Nazi, and it was hisintention to help Germany win the war. “History gives us examples[endnotes.xhtml#en0508] of human disease affecting the outcome of wars,” Blometold his Alsos interrogators, taking a moment to lecture them on history. “Weknow [that] from antiquity up till the time of [the] Napoleonic wars, victoriesand defeats were often determined by epidemics and starvation,” Blome said.Spreading an infectious disease could bring about the demise of a maraudingarmy, and Blome said that the failure of Napoleon’s Russian campaign was “due ingreat part to the infection of his horses with Glanders,” a highly contagiousbacterial disease. History aside, Blome said he counseled Himmler on the factthat a concentration camp was a terrible place to experiment with bubonic plaguebecause the population was too dense.Blome then told Himmler that if he were to experiment with plague bacterium, hewould need his own institute, an isolated facility far removed from populationcenters. Himmler and Blome agreed that Poland would be a good place, and theysettled on Nesselstedt [endnotes.xhtml#en0509], a small town outside the formerPoznań University (by then operated by the Reich). Blome’s research institutewas to be called the Bacteriological Institute at Nesselstedt.In the interim, in Berlin, Blome oversaw a field test using rats, history’straditional carrier of bubonic plague. A debate had been taking place inside theHygiene Institute of the Waffen-SS as to whether or not rats were the bestplague carriers. Himmler’s idea was “to take infected rats on to U-boats[endnotes.xhtml#en0510] and release them near the enemy shores so they couldswim to land.” Blome doubted that rats could swim great distances. He believedthey could swim only for as long as the air in their fur kept them afloat. Toprove his point, Blome arranged for a test on a Berlin lake. “About thirty ratswere taken out in a police boat and released at different distances from theshore to swim both with and against the wind.” Blome said that the rats weredumber than he thought—that when placed in the water, “they had no idea wherethe shore was and swam around in different directions.” A few of them drowned inten minutes. The longest any of the rats swam for was thirty minutes. Of thosereleased a little over a half-mile from shore, only a third reached land. As faras Blome was concerned, Himmler’s U-boat dispersal idea was not practical.Meeting Number Two took place a month or two later, in September or October1943, and was largely a repetition of the first, at least according to Blome.There was one significant development, however. Himmler asked Blome if he neededan assistant. Blome agreed that a bacteriologist would be helpful. Himmlerassigned [endnotes.xhtml#en0511] Dr. Karl Gross, formerly a staff member at theWaffen-SS Hygiene Institute.The two doctors did not get along. Blome became convinced that Dr. Gross hadbeen sent by Himmler to spy on him. He told his interrogators[endnotes.xhtml#en0512] that he was under great pressure to work faster. Himmlerrepeatedly “reiterated that the methods of waging BW [biological warfare] mustbe studied in order to understand the defense against it.” What this meant wasthat Himmler wanted Blome to infect human test subjects with plague to see whatwould happen to them.The third meeting took place four or five months later, in February 1944. Bythis time, Blome said, the facility at Nesselstedt had been built. There wasample staff housing, a well-equipped laboratory, and an animal farm. The blockfor experimental work included a climate room, a cold room, disinfectantfacilities, and rooms for “clean” and “dirty” experiments. There was anisolation hospital for sixteen people in the event that workers on Blome’s staffcontracted the disease. Work progressed slowly, Blome said, and Himmler becameenraged. Rumors of an Allied invasion of the European continent had become aconstant thorn in the side of the Reichsführer-SS. Why wasn’t the Reich’sbioweapons program more advanced, Himmler demanded to know. He asked Blome if itwas possible to “do something now—for example disseminate influenza—that woulddelay the heralded Anglo-American invasion in the West.” According to Blome, hetold Himmler “it was impossible to do anything on these lines.” Himmler proposedanother idea: How about disseminating a virulent strain of hoof-and-mouthdisease? Or tularemia, also called rabbit fever, which affected man in a mannersimilar to plague? Blome told Himmler that these were dangerous ideas, as anyoutbreak would surely affect Germany’s troops. The Reich needed a massivestockpile of vaccinations before it could feasibly launch a biological attack.Himmler stretched his thinking to target the Allies on their own soil. How aboutspreading cattle plague, also called rinderpest, in America or England? Himmlertold Blome that infecting the enemy’s food supply would have a sinister effecton enemy troops. Blome agreed and said he would investigate what it would taketo start a plague epidemic among the enemies’ cows. There was, however, aproblem, Blome explained. An international agreement prohibited stocks of therinderpest virus to be stored anywhere in Europe. Strains of cattle plague wereavailable only in the third world.Himmler said that he would get the cattle plague himself. He sent Dr. ErichTraub, a veterinarian from the Reich’s State Research Institute, located on theisland of Riems, to Turkey. There, Dr. Traub acquired [endnotes.xhtml#en0513] astrain of the lethal rinderpest virus. Under Blome’s direction, trials to infecthealthy cows with rinderpest began. Riems, in northern Germany in the Bay ofGreifswald, was totally isolated and self-contained. It was the perfect placefor these dangerous tests. The veterinary section used airplanes to spray thecattle plague virus on the island’s grassy fields, where cows grazed. Blome saidhe didn’t know much more about the program or its results—only that Dr. Traub,second in command at the research facility, was taken by the Russians when theRed Army captured Riems, in April 1945.Blome’s fourth meeting with Himmler took place in April or May of 1944. Himmlerhad become paranoid by now, Blome said. He believed that the Allies wereplotting a biological weapons attack against the Reich. “Blome was summoned bytelephone to see Himmler urgently. The latter had received a number of curiousreports. Grass had come floating out of the sky over some part of Austria and acow that had eaten some of it had died.” Blome told Himmler he’d look into it.There were additional strange events, Himmler confided to Blome. “Some smallballoons had been found near Salzberg [sic] and Berchtesgaden” not far fromHitler’s mountain residence, the Berghof. And potato beetles had been dropped inNormandy. Blome promised to study each incident.Blome told Himmler he had a pressing issue of his own. Given the progress of theRed Army, he thought it was wise to move his plague research institute at Posen(Poznań) somewhere inside Germany. The place Blome suggested was Geraberg, inthe Thuringian forest, at the edge of the Harz Mountains. Himmler said that theRussians would never reach Posen. By early fall, he had changed his mind. InOctober a new biological weapons research facility was being built, concealedinside a pine forest in the village of Geraberg.In the meantime, Blome told his interrogators, work on vaccines was movingforward—not at either of his research institutes but inside the army instead.Göring had moved epidemic control into the jurisdiction of a major general namedDr. Walter Schreiber, surgeon general of the Reich. Blome held the position ofdeputy surgeon general of the Reich, but the two men had equal positions underGöring, Blome explained. He, Blome, was in charge of creating the biologicalweapons; Dr. Schreiber was in charge of protecting Germans against biologicalweapons, should they be used—Major General Dr. Schreiber specialized in epidemiccontrol. The sword and the shield.Alsos was very interested in learning about these vaccines. Blome said thatMajor General Dr. Schreiber was the person to talk to about that. Where could hebe found? Blome said Schreiber had last been seen in Berlin. Word was he hadsurrendered to the Red Army and was their prisoner now.Blome said something else that alarmed interrogators [endnotes.xhtml#en0514].During the war, Dr. Kliewe told Blome that it was the Russians who had thesingle most extensive biological weapons program in the world—a program moreadvanced even than that of the Japanese. Further, the Russians had managed tocapture everything from Dr. Traub’s laboratory on Riems, including Dr. Traub’sTurkish strain of cattle plague. Then, in the winter of 1945, the Russians hadcaptured Blome’s bacteriological institute at Nesselstedt, outside Posen. Thismeant the Russians now had the Reich’s most advanced biological weapons researchand development facility, its steam chambers, incubators, refrigerators, anddeep-freeze apparatus. They also had all of the pathogens—viral andbacterial—that Blome had been working with when he had fled west.Alsos had two key pieces of information now: The Russians had the laboratory[endnotes.xhtml#en0515] from Posen and they had the doctor in charge ofvaccines, Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber. They had both the science and thescientist."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TEN [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter010]HIRED OR HANGED [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter010]The future of the scientists at Dustbin was obscure. Would they be hired by theU.S. government for future work, or would they be prosecuted by the Allies forwar crimes? At Ashcan the future facing the Nazi high command was almostcertainly grim, although there was much work to do. War crimes prosecutors faceda monumental task. They had to build criminal cases from scratch, a conundrumdescribed by Nuremberg trials prosecutor General Telford Taylor after the war.“Our task was to prepare [endnotes.xhtml#en0516] to prosecute the leading Nazison [specific] criminal charges.… The first question a prosecuting attorney asksin such a situation is, ‘Where’s the evidence?’ The blunt fact was that, despitewhat ‘everybody knew’ about the Nazi leaders, virtually no judicially admissibleevidence was at hand.” For evidence, prosecutors like Telford Taylor wererelying on interrogators like John Dolibois to glean facts from the Nazisinterned at Ashcan.Frustration was mounting at Ashcan. Prisoners were conspiring to withholdinformation. “They were whispering rather important secrets to each other,”Ashcan’s commander, Colonel Burton Andrus, recalled, “determined not to help onthe question of hidden loot, the whereabouts of people like Martin Bormann, andthe guilt for war atrocities [endnotes.xhtml#en0517].” Colonel Andrus racked hisbrain for ideas. How to make guilty men talk? “To jog the prisoners’ memoriesback to the reality of their grave situation we decided to show them atrocityfilms taken at Buchenwald [endnotes.xhtml#en0518].”Colonel Andrus assembled his fifty-two Nazi prisoners in one room. Before thefilm began, he addressed them with the following words: “You know about thesethings and I have no doubt many of you participated actively in them. We areshowing them to you not to inform you of what you already know, but to impresson you the fact that we know of it, too.”The lights went down and the first frames of the documentary footage flickeredacross the screen. Colonel Andrus watched his prisoners. Hans Frank, governorgeneral of occupied Poland, the lawyer and PhD largely responsible for themurder of the Jewish population there, put a handkerchief to his mouth andgagged. Joachim von Ribbentrop, the former champagne salesman who becameHitler’s foreign minister and pressured foreign states to allow the deportationof Jews in their territories to extermination camps in the east, got up from hischair and walked out of the room. Albert Kesselring, commander of the Luftwaffeinvasions into Poland, France, and the Soviet Union, who also led the Battle ofBritain, turned white. Hermann Göring sighed as if bored. Julius Streicher, theschoolteacher who became Hitler’s mouthpiece and encouraged readers toexterminate the Jews, sat on his chair “clasping and unclasping his hands.” Whenthe film was over, no one said a word. A little while later, Walter Funk, thefifty-five-year-old former minister of the war economy and president of theReichsbank, asked to see Colonel Andrus alone.Small, overweight, and suffering from venereal disease, this once supremelypowerful Nazi Party official twisted his fingers anxiously, while tellingColonel Andrus he had a confession to make. Walter Funk “looked incapable ofrunning a filling-station, let alone a bank,” Andrus recalled. Funk fidgetednervously. “I have something to tell you, sir,” Andrus recalled Funk saying. “Ihave been a bad man, Colonel, and I want to tell about it.” Funk started to cry[endnotes.xhtml#en0519]. Then he told Colonel Andrus that it was he who gave theorder that all gold in every prisoner’s mouth—in every concentration camp acrossthe Reich—be removed and collected for the Reichsbank’s reserves. Funk confessedthat at first he’d “had [the gold] knocked out of their mouths while they werealive, but [realized] if they were dead there was far less bother.” Andrus wasappalled. “I had never believed before that such a horrific order as the oneFunk was confessing to had ever been given,” Andrus said.Colonel Andrus told Funk to leave. In his memoir, Andrus wondered what WalterFunk had hoped to gain from his confession; he never got his answer. Whatevermotivated Funk that day at Ashcan eventually disappeared. Months later, atNuremberg, Funk denied that the conversation with Colonel Andrus had ever takenplace. Instead, he swore under oath that he had never been connected with ordersinvolving acquiring gold from Jews. “If it was done,” declared Funk, “it hasbeen kept from me up till now.”Save Funk’s tearful confession, the screening of the Buchenwald atrocity filmhad no apparent effect on the other prisoners. The men who gagged and left theroom had nothing more to say, and the rest of the Nazi high command remainedtight-lipped about their crimes. Colonel Andrus grew increasingly frustrated.The prisoners were allowed to sit outside in the Palace Hotel garden, in smallgroups out of earshot of prison guards. There, Andrus watched Hitler’s closestconfidants prattle on among themselves.“They could sit out in the garden [endnotes.xhtml#en0520] in the spring sunshineand chatter to their hearts’ content,” recalled Andrus. “Undoubtedly theycompared notes on the interrogation[s] which went on in sixteen booths everyday.” If only G-2 had wired the Ashcan garden for sound. Colonel Andrus got anidea. He made a list of the four men who he believed were the biggest“backstabbers and gossips” in the group. “Those with outspoken views about theirfellow Nazis—men ready to blame each other for their own crimes.” Göring,“verbose,” von Papen, “malicious,” Kesselring, “vain,” and Admiral Horthy, “thePrince of Austria who believed he was better than everyone else,” were chosen.With permission from headquarters, Andrus devised an elaborate ruse intended toextract information from the Nazi prisoners.The four men were told that they were being handed over to the British forinterrogation; that soon they would be traveling to a villa in Germany to bequestioned there. In reality, Army Intelligence, G-2, had rented a house locatedthree and a half miles from Ashcan. It was a traditional German-stylehalf-timber house with a high wall running around its perimeter. U.S. Armysignal intelligence engineers spent several days running hundreds of yards ofwires through the house, under floorboards, behind walls, inside furniturecushions and lighting fixtures. In a final touch, they wired the garden forsound. The engineers burrowed through the backyard garden and attached tinymicrophones to a single tree above the sitting area. All wires connected back toa recording machine capable of laying audio tracks down onto gramophone records.This was high technology in the summer of 1945.At the Ashcan detention center, Göring, von Papen, Kesselring, and AdmiralHorthy were loaded into an ambulance, a common means of transport after the war,and driven away. Black curtains had been drawn across the vehicle windows so theprisoners couldn’t see where they were being taken. For hours, the ambulancedrove around in what Andrus called a “circuitous route,” covering fifty miles ofterrain but never leaving Luxembourg. When the ambulance pulled up to theGermanic-looking house and unloaded the Nazis, Göring was thrilled.“We are at a house I know!” boasted Göring, assuring his colleagues they hadarrived in beautiful Heidelberg. “I recognize the decor on the walls,” Göringsaid once inside.The bedrooms in the new quarters had fresh sheets, plush mattresses, and softpillows. Strolling through the house, Göring pointed to a chandelier and warnedhis fellow Nazis to be wary of listening devices. When one of the prisonersasked if they could sit outside in the garden, a guard checked with a superiorand said yes. Göring made note of a single patch of shade under a weeping willowtree and suggested it as a good spot. The men dragged four garden chairs intothe shade, sat down, and began to gossip.“Heavy, guttural voices could be heard loud and clear,” Andrus recalled. “Theywere being recorded onto the black gramophone disks.”It was a brilliant start. But only a start. Soon, it began to rain. The menmoved inside. There, they sat around barely saying a word. The following day, itrained again. That evening, Colonel Andrus received an order from SHAEF. Theeavesdropping project was being shut down. Andrus had twenty-four hours to packup his prisoners and leave.This time the ambulance took the direct route back to Mondorf, just three and ahalf miles away. “Göring was furious,” Andrus recalled. “How could they havegotten back to the prison so quickly! They realized they’d been had.”Back at Ashcan, things moved in a whirlwind. John Dolibois received a “Letter ofAuthority” on August 10, 1945, stating that CCPWE No. 32 was going to be closeddown. Dolibois was to be part of the transport team now taking prisoners to newlocations. For reasons Dolibois was not privy to, thirty-three of the fifty-twoAshcan internees were going [endnotes.xhtml#en0521] to a new prisoner of warinterrogation facility, this one located in the small town of Oberursel in theTaunus Mountains. Only later would Dolibois learn that many of these Nazis wouldbe hired by the U.S. Army to write intelligence reports on work they had doneduring the war. Oberursel was just a few miles from the Dustbin facility atCastle Kransberg. The transport would be a convoy of six ambulances, a commandcar, a jeep, a trailer, and a truck carrying the prisoners’ suitcases. Doliboiswas assigned to ride in the first ambulance. His prisoner list included[endnotes.xhtml#en0522] Admiral Karl Dönitz, Field Marshal Albert Kesselring,General Walter Warlimont, cabinet minister Schwerin von Krosigk, OKW ForeignOffice head Admiral Leopold Bürkner, and Admiral Gerhard Wagner.The trip from Mondorf to Oberursel was a journey through ruined countryside.Crossing from Luxembourg into Germany, Dolibois watched the chatter among theNazis in his backseat [endnotes.xhtml#en0523] come to a “halting end” as theysaw the destruction and despair everywhere. “This was their first look at thecondition of their country” since the war, Dolibois explained. From churches toadministrative buildings to shops, entire villages had been reduced to rubble.In three months of peace there were no resources to clean anything up. Peoplewere starving and trying to survive. “The destruction that was the aftermath ofHitler’s determination to ‘fight to the last man,’ ” said Dolibois.The convoy arrived in Oberursel. Like many other army interrogation facilitiesacross the American zone in postwar Germany, the one in Oberursel had been animportant Third Reich military post during the war. Oberursel had a particularlystoried past. This Dulag Luft, or Durchgangslager (terms for air force prisonerof war camp, or transit camp), had functioned as the sole interrogation andevaluation center for the Luftwaffe. It was here that Nazi interrogators hadquestioned every Allied pilot who had been shot down during the war. TheLuftwaffe’s lead interrogator, Hanns Scharff, kept a diary[endnotes.xhtml#en0524]. “Every enemy aviator who is captured… will be broughtto this place for questioning. It makes no difference whether he is takenprisoner at the front lines or whether he comes dangling down from the sky inthe most remote location… he comes to Oberursel,” wrote Scharff.Physically, things had not changed much since Oberursel had changed hands. Theinterrogation facility centered around a large half-timber “mountain house” thatserved as an officers’ club. Nearby there were fourteen buildings for officerhousing. The prisoners’ barracks, a large U-shaped building, contained 150solitary jail cells. This building had been called “The Cooler” during the war,and it was the place where interrogator Hanns Scharff did most of his work withcaptured Allied pilots. Now it was the new home for thirty-three former Ashcaninternees, at least for a while.Dolibois turned his charges over to the guard detail at Oberursel. His orderssaid to return to Luxembourg and wait for new orders. Setting out for Ashcan, herode in the lead jeep with an enlisted man. A little less than an hour south ofFrankfurt, Dolibois came upon a row of U.S. Army trucks stopped along the sideof the road. One of the soldiers stepped into the road and signaled forDolibois’s convoy to stop. John Dolibois climbed out of his jeep. He becameoverwhelmed by a horrific stench, “sickeningly sweet, nauseating,” he laterrecalled. He heard retching. Several of the men in his convoy had gotten out oftheir vehicles and were now throwing up along the side of the road.“What is that horrible smell? [endnotes.xhtml#en0525]” Dolibois asked a soldierbehind the wheel of one of the stalled vehicles. “What in God’s name are youhauling?”The captain climbed out of his jeep. He did not say a word but motioned forDolibois to follow him behind one of the two-and-a-half-ton trucks. In silence,the captain untied a rope and flipped back a sheet of canvas that had obscuredthe cargo from view until now. Dolibois stared into the body of the truck. Ittook him a moment for him to realize what he was looking at: rotting corpses.“Putrefied,” he recalled. “Most were naked. Some still wore the pajama-likestriped pants, the concentration camp uniforms, now just rotting rags. It wasthe most horrible sight I had ever seen.”The army captain spoke in a flat, emotionless tone. “There are thousands ofthem, five truck loads,” he told Dolibois. “We’re hauling them from one massgrave to another. Don’t ask me why.” These were bodies from Dachau. Corpsesfound upon liberation. The army captain’s convoy had come to a standstill afterone of the vehicles had broken down. They’d been waiting at the roadside for anescort when Dolibois’s convoy from Oberursel had arrived. The captain askedDolibois if his group could escort them to the next military station down theroad. Dolibois agreed. “I found myself leading a bizarre caravan: six emptyambulances, an empty weapons carrier, followed by five two-and-a-half-ton trucksloaded with the obscenity of the Nazi final solution,” remembered Dolibois. Thedead bodies were being taken to a proper burial spot on orders from the Officeof Military Government, United States (OMGUS).Back at Ashcan the world appeared different to him now. There, the rest ofHitler’s inner circle remained, men “directly responsible for that ghastlytransport,” said Dolibois. If John Dolibois ever had a shred of doubt about thedegree of barbarism and the collective guilt of the men he had spent threemonths interrogating at Ashcan, in that moment there was no hesitation anymore.At age ninety-three, John Dolibois says, “I still smell that foul odor ofdeath.”But in August 1945, there was barely any time for the young interrogator toprocess what he had witnessed. Back at Ashcan he fell into bed and slept hard.Come morning, John Dolibois received new orders from Colonel Andrus. There wasstill a group of Nazi Bonzen at Ashcan. Dolibois was to be on the team thatwould move them to the Nuremberg prison. Colonel Andrus had selected JohnDolibois to fly with the remaining members of the Nazi high command on atransport plane.Dawn, August 12, 1945. The sun had not yet risen in the sky. Ashcan’s last groupof Nazis were escorted out of the classified interrogation facility and drivenin ambulances a short distance to the airport at Luxembourg City[endnotes.xhtml#en0526]. A C-47 transport plane idled on the tarmac, strippeddown to its bare bones. Inside the aircraft, a single row of seats ran down eachside. There was a honey bucket toilet and a urinal attached to a door at theback of the airplane. To Dolibois, it seemed as if Colonel Andrus was nervous.“Something was cooking,” Dolibois recalled. Security was always on the colonel’smind. “Aha!” Dolibois realized what it was. “Kaltenbrunner!”Ernst Kaltenbrunner was considered the most dangerous Nazi among the highcommand. At 6′4″, he was a giant man with a massive frame, a pockmarked face,and a huge head with seven or eight deep dueling scars running across both sidesof his forehead, cheeks, and chin. He drank and smoked heavily and was missingteeth. Kaltenbrunner was described by the British journalist Rebecca West aslooking like “a particularly vicious horse.” He held a doctorate in law andspecialized in secret police work. He was the head of the Reich Security MainOffice and chief of the security police and the security services. He was asactively involved in concentration camp crimes as any Nazi had been. Accordingto the OSS, even Heinrich Himmler was frightened [endnotes.xhtml#en0527] of him.If anyone was going to “cause trouble on the flight to Nuremberg,” Doliboisexplains, Colonel Andrus was worried that Ernst Kaltenbrunner might. “Specialprecautions needed to be taken.” Kaltenbrunner would be handcuffed to Dolibois’sleft wrist. “If he starts to run or goes for the door,” Colonel Andrus toldDolibois, “shoot!” Colonel Andrus wished John Dolibois “good luck” during theflight and said that he would see him once they landed in Nuremberg. ColonelAndrus would be traveling in a different airplane.During the flight Kaltenbrunner did not run for the door. Instead, he wanted totalk. He told Dolibois that he desired for the young interrogator to understandthat he, Kaltenbrunner, was not responsible for war crimes. “He felt the need toexplain about the Jews,” Dolibois recalled, with Kaltenbrunner saying,“admittedly, he hated them, but he said that he had not been involved in theirtreatment in concentration camps. In fact, he claimed to have remonstrated withHitler on the treatment of the Jews.” As the airplane prepared to land inNuremberg, Kaltenbrunner said what so many Nazis repeated after the war. “I am asoldier and I only obeyed orders,” he told Dolibois.“I didn’t argue with him, I just listened,” Dolibois said. “Kaltenbrunner was aruthless killer determined to save his own skin. His soft talk did not change mymind about him, but it helped pass the time.” When the aircraft finally touchedthe ground, Dolibois felt a huge wave of relief. The prisoners were unloaded,and Colonel Andrus assumed control of them once again. Without looking back,Dolibois hurried on to the transport plane. The plane taxied down the runway andtook flight. Dolibois sat alone in the empty airplane. The weeks ofinterrogating the Nazi high command were over. The Nazis he had just flown withwould now be tried for war crimes at the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg. Amajority of them would be hanged.Back at Ashcan, when Dolibois returned to his quarters to pack his bags, he cameacross a strange sight. Standing by the edge of the perimeter fence, not farfrom where Dolibois had first pulled up to this place in an army jeep threemonths before, he spotted a middle-aged man [endnotes.xhtml#en0528], apparentlya local, with his hands in his pockets and a beret on his head. The man juststood there, shouting out in the direction of the Palace Hotel. Dolibois took amoment to pause and listen so he could make out what the man was saying.“Hallo Meier! Hallo Meier!” the man shouted, again and again. “Wie gehts inBerlin?”It took a moment for the significance of what the man was doing to register withDolibois. The phrase translated into English as “Hello, Meier! Hello, Meier! So,how’s it going in Berlin?” The beauty of the moment dawned on him. In the earlydays of the war, Hermann Göring was so confident the Third Reich would win thewar that he’d famously bragged to the German people, “If the British and theAmericans ever bomb Berlin, my name is Meier.”The image of the middle-aged Luxembourger taunting Göring was a perfect end tothis chapter in John Dolibois’s life. The man was enjoying himself so muchDolibois felt no need to tell him that Göring was gone. Besides, Hermann Göringwas never coming back.In Washington, on July 6, 1945, in a classified memorandum with the subjectheading “Exploitation of German Specialists in Science and Technology in theUnited States,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff finally approved—on paper—a Naziscientist program [endnotes.xhtml#en0529]. President Truman was not made awareof the initiative. The governing body that had been assigned to “exercisegeneral supervision” over the program and to “formulate general policies[endnotes.xhtml#en0530] for procurement, utilization and control of specialists”was the Military Intelligence Division of the War Department, G-2. A five-pagememo was sent out to eight agencies within the War Department outlining“principles and procedures” governing the classified program. The three mostimportant points were that “certain German specialists… could be utilized toincrease our war making capacity against Japan and aid our postwar militaryresearch,” that “no known or alleged war criminals should be brought to theUnited States,” and that “the purpose of this plan should be understood to betemporary military exploitation of the minimum number of German specialistsnecessary.” According to this initiative, as soon as the jobs were completed“the specialists would be returned to Europe.” Participants, it was noted,should be hereafter referred to as “eminent German specialists” as opposed to“German scientists,” because not all the Nazis being requested for programapproval had degrees in science. Included in the mix were Nazi bureaucrats,businessmen, accountants, and lawyers. The project also now had an official codename, Operation Overcast. The name Paperclip would not be used for another eightmonths.Military agencies that were interested in hiring German specialists were tosubmit their requests to the assistant chief of staff, G-2. “Only the mostcompelling argument should bring a German specialist to this country,” theinitiative stated, and only the “chosen, rare minds whose continuingintellectual productivity we wish to use” would be approved. The British wouldbe made aware of the program, in general terms. At some point after the firstlarge group of scientists had arrived in the United States, a “suitable” pressrelease would be generated by the War Department so as to “avoid possibleresentment on the part of the American public.”A list of desired German scientists—“List I”—accompanied the memo. It included115 rocket specialists. When the British learned about the U.S. Army’sintentions to hire the German rocket scientists, they asked to first be allowedto conduct two rocket exploitation projects of their own. The Americans agreedand released into British custody a group of scientists, engineers, andtechnicians including Wernher von Braun, Walter Dornberger, and Arthur Rudolph.The first British project was called Operation Backfire [endnotes.xhtml#en0531],a V-2 field test that took place on Germany’s north coast, at a former Kruppnaval gun range in Cuxhaven. Operation Backfire was designed to analyzetechnical data about the V-2 by having the Nazi rocket engineers fire fourrockets, also taken piecemeal from Nordhausen, at a target in the North Sea.This would allow the British to evaluate various technical elements, from howthe rocket was launched to its flight controls and fuels. Arthur Rudolph, theformer Mittelwerk operations director, was considered an expert in launchtechniques, and to his biographer, he later recalled a scene from OperationBackfire: “The V-2 ran on alcohol of the same chemistry as that appearing insay, Jack Daniels and Old Grandad [sic]. The people at the test site apparentlyknew that.” One night, according to Rudolph, a group of British and German V-2technicians got drunk together on the rocket fuel. A British officer came uponthe group arm in arm, “apparently comrades now, and lustily singing, Wir Fahrengegen England, [endnotes.xhtml#en0532] or ‘We Will March Against England.’ ”General Dornberger was not part of the drinking and singing. The British kepthim on a short leash, away from the test firing and always under a watchful eye.The British had alternative plans for Walter Dornberger. They were notinterested in the knowledge Dornberger possessed. They wanted to try him for warcrimes. After the test, he would not be returned to the Americans as the Britishhad originally promised.“The British pulled a sneaky on us [endnotes.xhtml#en0533],” explained MajorStaver, who attended Operation Backfire. The Americans were not permitted totake Dornberger back after the Operation; instead, Dornberger was declared “onloan” and was taken to England. There, he and von Braun were “interrogated for aweek [endnotes.xhtml#en0534] by the British and then kept behind barbed wire inWimbledon for four and one-half weeks while waiting to be picked up by theAmericans.” Eventually, von Braun was returned but General Dornberger was not.Instead, he was issued a brown jumpsuit [endnotes.xhtml#en0535] with the letters“PW” for Prisoner of War stenciled on the back. Under armed guard, he was takento the London District Cage near the Windermere Bridge for interrogation. Fromthere, General Dornberger was transferred first to a castle in Wales and then toSpecial Camp XI in Island Farm, South Wales, where he was an extremely unpopularprisoner.“Walter Dornberger was definitely the most hated man [endnotes.xhtml#en0536] inthe camp,” Sergeant Ron Williams, a prison guard, recalled. “Even his own peoplehated him. He never went out to the local farms to work like other prisoners.”Wherever General Dornberger went while he was at Special Camp XI, he required anescort. The British feared that other prisoners might kill him.On the morning of September 12, 1945, Wernher von Braun, Dr. Eberhard Rees, andfive midlevel [endnotes.xhtml#en0537] V-2 rocket engineers left their U.S.Army–sponsored housing, in the town of Witzenhausen, for the last time. The menclimbed into two army jeeps, headed for France. The Germans knew they wereheading to the United States to work. They were not aware that their driver,First Lieutenant Morris Sipser, spoke German. As First Lieutenant Sipser drovethe group to their destination in Paris, he listened to von Braun crack crassanti-American jokes [endnotes.xhtml#en0538]. The jeep crossed over the SaarRiver into France, and Sipser overheard von Braun [endnotes.xhtml#en0539] say tohis colleagues, “Well, take a good look at Germany, fellows. You may not see itfor a long time to come.” In Washington, Operation Overcast had been approved asa “temporary” program, but von Braun, ever the visionary, had the foresight tosee that many of the rocketeers and engineers were heading to America to stay.“We felt no moral scruples about the possible future use of our brainchild,” vonBraun later told New Yorker magazine writer Daniel Lang [endnotes.xhtml#en0540].“We were interested solely in exploring outer space. It was simply a questionwith us of how the golden cow could be milked most successfully.”After arriving in Paris, the Germans were taken to the officers’ club at OrlyAirport for dinner. Accompanying von Braun, Rees, and the five other V-2engineers were four scientists from the Hermann Göring Research Institute,handpicked by Colonel Putt [endnotes.xhtml#en0541] and headed for Wright Field.They were Theodor Zobel, Rudolph Edse, Wolfgang Noggerath and Gerhard Braun.Luftwaffe test pilot Karl Baur was also with the group; he had served asaircraft manufacturer Messerschmitt’s chief Me-262 test pilot. Accompanying himhe had his mechanic, Andreas Sebald. A little before 10:00 p.m., the Germansboarded a C-54 military transport [endnotes.xhtml#en0542] plane waiting on thetarmac in the pouring rain.“Quickly the plane moved [endnotes.xhtml#en0543] through the clouds and abeautiful, clear sky with a moonlight night greeted us,” Karl Baur wrote in hisdiary. “For the first time—I cannot recall the number of years—I enjoyed aflight as a passenger.”After a stop to refuel on the island of Santa Maria, in the Azores, the aircraftcrossed the Atlantic, refueled in Newfoundland, and landed at New Castle Airportin Wilmington, Delaware, at 2:00 a.m. on September 20, 1945. Because the Germanswere under military custody, they could not be traditionally processed byCustoms. After a few hours, the sixteen Germans boarded a second, smallerairplane and were flown to the Naval Air Station at Squantum, in Quincy,Massachusetts.At the naval base the Germans were loaded into sedans and driven out to the edgeof dock, where a troopship waited for them. They boarded the vessel and made ashort trip to a chain of small islands in Boston Harbor, the Harbor Islands, andout to the far end to a gravel shoal off Nixes Mate, where they were obscuredfrom civilian view. There, a small Boston whaler idled on the sea. Its captainwas named Corky, and the twenty-one-year-old intelligence officer who would takecharge of the Germans was named Henry Kolm. Each German scientist was lowereddown into the little Boston whaler by a harness hanging from a rope. “They wereall seasick as can be [endnotes.xhtml#en0544],” Kolm later recalled.Fort Strong, on an island in the middle of Boston Harbor, had been used as atraining camp during the Civil War and remained in use on and off through WorldWar I. The fortresslike nature of the coastal defense facility made it an idealplace for a secret military program [endnotes.xhtml#en0545] like OperationOvercast. When the first German scientists arrived in September 1945, thefortress was still under army control but had not been used for nearly thirtyyears. Thick weeds grew in between the gun blocks and pedestal mounts. Theadministration and observation buildings had fallen into disrepair. But the armybarracks was easily converted into what would become known as the OperationOvercast hotel [endnotes.xhtml#en0547]. German prisoners of war were moved ontothe island to work as staff, including as translators, cooks, bakers, andtailors. Kolm’s job was to process the scientists, which includedfingerprinting, medical examinations, and coordination with the FBI. This alltook time, and the Germans were not known for patience. Before long an insidiousunease [endnotes.xhtml#en0546] settled in among the scientists, Kolm recalled.When the weather was clear the Germans played volleyball games outside. Far offin the distance they could make out the Boston skyline and see the tall, shinybuildings on shore. But often the fog rolled in, and the island was soaked in athick, dense mist for days at a time. To pass the time the scientists stayedindoors and played Monopoly, which they called the “capitalists’ game.”[endnotes.xhtml#en0548] Still, it was impossible to deny that Fort Strong tookon a penal colony feel, as Kolm recalled. Soon the Germans started calling theirnew home Devil’s Island. Finally, on September 29, 1945, Major James P. Hamill,an intelligence officer with the Army Ordnance Corps, was sent to the east coastof the island to escort a group of Germans off. Hamill had been in Nordhausenwith Major Staver at war’s end and had personally assisted in the mission tolocate enough rocket parts to reconfigure one hundred of them at the White SandsProving Ground. His presence on Devil’s Island had to have been a welcome oneamong the rocket scientists. Hamill took six of them—Eberhard Rees, ErichNeubert, Theodor Poppel, August Schulze, Wilhelm Jungert, and WalterSchwidetzky—to Aberdeen Proving Ground, where they began translating,cataloguing, and evaluating the information from the Dörnten mine stash.Hamill’s next mission was to escort Wernher von Braun by train to Fort Bliss,Texas.The train ride began on October 6, 1945, and was a memorable event. OperationOvercast was a highly classified military matter, and Major Hamill was required[endnotes.xhtml#en0549] to keep watch over von Braun twenty-four hours a day.Drawing any kind of attention to the German scientist was to be avoided at allcost. In St. Louis, Major Hamill and von Braun were assigned to a Pullman carfilled with wounded war veterans from the 82nd Division, renowned for parachuteassaults into Sicily and Salerno. Also in the train car were wounded warveterans from the 101st Airborne Division, men lauded for action in the Normandyinvasion and the Battle of the Bulge.Hamill quickly arranged for himself and von Braun to be moved into a differentcar. The train moved along to the Texas border. Hamill watched as the mansitting next to von Braun began engaging him in friendly conversation, askingvon Braun where he was from and what business he was in. Von Braun, apparentlywell versed in lying on demand, replied that he was from Switzerland and that hewas in “the steel business.”“Well it turned out [endnotes.xhtml#en0550] that this particular gentleman knewSwitzerland like the back of his hand,” Major Hamill later recalled[endnotes.xhtml#en0551], “and was himself in the steel business.” Von Braunquickly qualified “steel business” to mean “ball bearings.” As it so happenedthe man was also an expert on ball bearings, Hamill explained. The train whistleblew. The approaching station stop was Texarkana, which was the businessman’sdestination. As the man prepared to exit the train he turned back to von Braunand waved good-bye to him.“If it wasn’t for the help that you Swiss gave us, there is no telling as towhom might have won the war,” the businessman said.Army Ordnance finally had their scientists on U.S. soil, and work commenced atFort Bliss without delay. In Germany, the drama between the U.S. ChemicalWarfare Service and FIAT over the suspected war criminal Otto Ambros escalated.Despite orders from SHAEF to arrest him, Ambros remained a fugitive in plainsight. He lived and worked with impunity in the French zone. At Dustbin, FIATofficers continued to learn more about who Ambros was and the wartime role thathe had played in chemical weapons research and development. In an interrogationwith Albert Speer, FIAT learned that no single person had been as critical tothe development of Hitler’s vast arsenal of nerve agents and poison gases asOtto Ambros had been. “He is known to have spoken to Hitler[endnotes.xhtml#en0552] at a high-level German conference on Chemical Warfare,”a FIAT report read. Another stated, “Ambros’ importance, from the Intelligencepoint of view, has been re-emphasized by the recent Chemical Warfareinvestigation at ‘Dustbin.’ Speer and the German Chemical Warfare experts agreethat he is the key man [endnotes.xhtml#en0553] in German Chemical Warfareproduction.” Major Tilley was outraged by it all, but there was little he coulddo except put Ambros under surveillance.Initial attempts to capture Dr. Ambros maintained the fiction of civility. “Atthe end of August or beginning of September 1945, an attempt was made to induceAmbros to return to the American zone,” Tilley wrote in a FIAT report. Inresponse, “Ambros claimed to be unable [endnotes.xhtml#en0554] to return then asthe French authorities would not permit him to leave the French zone.” MajorTilley knew this was a lie. Ambros regularly traveled back and forth betweenLudwigshafen, in the French zone, and the IG Farben guesthouse, Villa Kohlhof,outside Heidelberg, in the American zone. This made Tilley furious. “This man isthought to be far too dangerous and undesirable to be left at liberty, let alonebe employed by the Allied authorities,” Tilley wrote. FIAT authorized him to setup a sting operation in an attempt to capture and arrest Ambros. CaptainEdelsten was assigned the job of tracking Ambros day and night. Through theCounter Intelligence Corps in Heidelberg, Captain Edelsten, working with aColonel Mumford, set up a network of undercover agents who began to followAmbros’s every move. “Saw Ambros at LU [Ludwigshafen] [endnotes.xhtml#en0555],”read one report. “Drives his own car, usually alone. Slept in car for two hoursone night, on roadside,” another set of field notes revealed. Ambros traveledfrequently: to Freiburg, Rheinfelden, and Baden-Baden. He’d even been back toGendorf—a brazen move, considering the Seventh Army had an outstanding arrestwarrant for him there. But Ambros was quicker than the U.S. Army and had abetter intelligence network in place as well. Whenever the U.S. Army showed up[endnotes.xhtml#en0556] to arrest him, he was already gone.Finally, Captain Edelsten reached Ambros on the telephone. “Edelsten told Ambrosthat Col. Mumford was anxious to see him again,” and asked if a meeting could bearranged for the following Sunday, at the Farben villa. Ambros agreed. FIATplanned its takedown. Plain clothes CIC officers would wait outside VillaKohlhof, out of eyesight, until after Captain Edelsten placed Ambros underarrest. Then they’d step in and transport the wanted war criminal back toDustbin. Except Ambros was one step ahead. With his well established “privateintelligence center [endnotes.xhtml#en0557] complete with secretaries and errandboys,” he learned the meeting was a ruse to arrest him. When Edelsten arrived atthe villa, Ambros’s secretary invited him inside. Smiling broadly, sheapologized and said “Dr. Ambros is not able to come.” Edelsten feignedunderstanding and sat down at a large banquet table elegantly set for eight. Thesecretary whispered in his ear, “You have been at Gendorf,” as if to taunt him.Ambros, it turned out, had his own people following the FIAT agents who had beentailing him, a posse of “various deputies [between] Ludwigshafen and Gendorf.”Embarrassed and infuriated by the audacity of it all, Edelsten finished his teaand got up to leave. “Just as Edelsten was leaving, Ambros’s car pulled in(Chevrolet),” and for a fleeting moment Edelsten believed he would capture himafter all. Instead, a look-alike “emerged from [the] car and said [Ambros] wasunable to come.” Ambros had sent a double; Edelsten had been burned.FIAT was being made fun of, and there was little they could do. Captain Edelstenleft the IG Farben villa red-faced and empty-handed. “Gave CIC description ofAmbros’s car,” he noted in his report. “Light blue closed Saloon (Chevrolet).”Edelsten posted his men to watch the bridges around Heidelberg and promised toarrest Ambros if he ever arrived. But of course he never did. Adding insult toinjury, the following day Dr. Otto Ambros sent Captain Edelsten a formal note,neatly typed on fancy stationery, with Farben’s wartime address still embossedon the letterhead. “Sorry that I could not [endnotes.xhtml#en0558] make theappointment,” Ambros wrote. He signed his name in thick black ink.At Dustbin, Major Tilley continued to interrogate Ambros’s colleagues. In lateAugust 1945, Tilley got a very lucky lead from Ambros’s former deputy, theFarben chemist Jürgen von Klenck. Von Klenck was back at Dustbin now, and underintense scrutiny after having been in attendance alongside Ambros at the meetingwith Tarr and the representative from Dow Chemical, Wilhelm Hirschkind. Jürgenvon Klenck had amassed a sizable Dustbin dossier [endnotes.xhtml#en0559] of hisown. A Nazi ideologue, von Klenck had been a loyal party member since 1933 andan officer with the SS since 1936. One interrogator described him as “wily,”“untrustworthy,” and “not employable.” Von Klenck was also an elitist and hadmade more than a few enemies because of this. Speaking in confidence with MajorTilley, fellow chemist and Dustbin internee Wilhelm Horn candidly expressed histhought about Jürgen von Klenck. Von Klenck had a “magnetic presence, abrilliant mind, [was] handsome, polished and a wonderful talker, but lack[ed]the essential characteristics that would make him a truly great man,” said Horn.This was because von Klenck was “an egoist… very proud of the nobility impliedin his name, and an opportunist who knew how to make the best of his chances.”Horn confirmed [endnotes.xhtml#en0560] that von Klenck was a long-standing andavowed Nazi but that “it had always grated von Klenck’s pride that such commonpeople as Hitler and his minions were in the highest places,” said Horn.Tilley asked Horn how high up von Klenck was in the production of war gases.Horn revealed that von Klenck had been deputy chief of the ultra-secretCommittee-C for chemical weapons. In other words, Jürgen von Klenck was OttoAmbros’s right-hand man [endnotes.xhtml#en0561]. Armed with this information,Major Tilley presented von Klenck with a piece of paper to sign. It was adeclaration, “stating that he knew none of which had been concealed by others.”Von Klenck refused to sign. Tilley explained that withholding information was acrime. Threatened with arrest, von Klenck admitted that there were a few thingshe hadn’t been entirely truthful about.He told Major Tilley that in the late fall of 1944, Ambros had instructed him todestroy all paperwork regarding war gases, particularly the contracts betweenFarben and the Wehrmacht. Instead von Klenck had “carefully selected” a cache ofimportant documents and secreted them away in a large steel drum. He had hiredsomeone to bury the steel drum on a remote farm outside Gendorf. Where, exactly,von Klenck said he wasn’t sure. He told Tilley that he had “deliberately refusedto learn where the [documents] were buried in order to be able to deny that heknew of any documents concealed anywhere.” He gave Major Tilley a list ofpossible hiding places.For two months Major Tilley searched the countryside around Gendorf for thesteel drum, interviewing locals and patiently waiting for a solid lead. Finally,on October 27, 1945, he found what he’d been looking for. During aninterrogation with Gendorf’s fire chief, a man called Brandmeister Keller, thelocation was revealed. There was more. Brandmeister Keller had also hiddendocuments for Otto Ambros. “At first, Keller denied that he had secreted anydocuments,” read the FIAT report. “When he was told that his arrest order was inMajor Tilley’s pocket he remembered four boxes Ambros had asked him to fetch in1945.… Ambros gave him various barrels and boxes to hide with various farmers inGendorf.” But the most important barrel, the large steel drum from von Klenck,had been “buried at the lonely farm [endnotes.xhtml#en0562] of Lorenz Moser,near Burghausen.”Von Klenck’s hidden barrel produced hard evidence, including a letter fromAmbros stating that he had been in charge of document destruction—and why. “Allpapers which prove our cooperation with Tabun and Sarin in the low-works, theDL-plant in the upper-work, must of course be destroyed or placed in security,”read one letter inside the drum, signed by Otto Ambros. It was attached to astack of nerve agent contracts [endnotes.xhtml#en0563] between Farben andSpeer’s ministry, papers that von Klenck had been ordered to destroy. Thesecontracts chronicled “full details [endnotes.xhtml#en0564] of TABUN productionand other details of DYHERNFURTH (now in Russian hands), including a detailedplan of all buildings and much or most of the apparatus… photographs anddrawings… and many other valuable data, covering the period from 1938 or earlieruntil March 1945.” Now Major Tilley had two key pieces of evidence he had nothad before.There was more damning information pertaining specifically to Otto Ambros thathad been hidden in the steel drum. One document, written by Albert Speer,described two meetings with himself, Ambros, and Hitler in June 1944 which notonly confirmed the high position that Ambros held but that he was a warprofiteer. “I (SPEER) [endnotes.xhtml#en0565] reported to the Führer that Dr.AMBROS of I.G. FARBEN had developed a new process by which Buna of the samequality as natural rubber can be produced. Some time in the future no furtherimports of natural rubber will be required… the Führer has ordered a donation ofone million marks” to Ambros, Speer wrote. A final piece of evidence shined alight on Farben’s long-term plans for its business venture at Auschwitz. Inaddition to its Buna factory, IG Farben planned to produce chemical weapons atthe death camp. The company had “plans for further construction of CW plant atAUSCHWITZ [endnotes.xhtml#en0566]… in February 1945,” Tilley wrote in his FIATreport.Tilley returned to Dustbin with the steel drum and the documents. Von Klenckappeared shocked when Tilley told him that the steel drum had been located.“There are indications that he did not expect them to be found,” read Tilley’sintelligence report [endnotes.xhtml#en0567]. FIAT now had documentary evidencethat Ambros was “guilty of contravening American Military Government laws byconcealing documents connected with German military preparations.” There werehundreds of documents, including “full data on Dyhernfurth, production sheetsfor Tabun and other war gases,” as well as “many other matters which [Ambros]claimed to have burned in the furnaces at Gendorf in April 1945. It may well bethat these papers, added to the formulas, production methods, and the secret CWcontracts between IG and the Reich from 1935 to 1945, which were discovered in aGendorf safe [endnotes.xhtml#en0568] on that same day, may give us a morecomplete picture of German CW preparations than of most other fields of Germanarmament and general war production.” Major Tilley had pulled off a scientificintelligence coup d’état.Tilley took the information to a colleague, a veteran intelligence officer, whoreminded him that there was an alternative theory [endnotes.xhtml#en0569] to beconsidered regarding von Klenck. “Basing oneself on experience with enemy agentswho confess plots freely, one may come to the conclusion that a lesser secrethas been admitted to deflect the investigation from a more important secret,”the officer explained. Efforts to capture Ambros were redoubled. Two days afterthe steel drum find, on October 29, 1945, the British Intelligence ObjectivesSub-committee issued a warrant [endnotes.xhtml#en0570] for the “Arrest of Dr.Ambros.” Now there were two out of three Allied nations lobbying for theimmediate arrest of Hitler’s favorite chemist.Otto Ambros was “dangerous” and “undesirable” and should not be “left atliberty,” read the arrest report. FIAT knew Ambros could remain protected aslong as he stayed in the French zone. “He is wily and he will remain there as heknows the hunt for him is on in the U.S. Zone,” the report explained. There waslittle to do but wait. But patience again paid off.It took three months for Otto Ambros’s hubris to get the better of him. OnJanuary 17, 1946, Ambros traveled outside the French zone and was arrested. Hewas sent to Dustbin, where Major Tilley was waiting to interrogate him. AfterFIAT squeezed him for information, Ambros was turned over to Colonel BurtonAndrus, now commandant of the Nuremberg jail. Sometime in the foreseeable futureAmbros would face judgment at Nuremberg.Any suggestion that Otto Ambros would one day have a prominent and prosperousplace in civilized society, and that the American government would be just oneof the governments to employ him, would have seemed pure fantasy. Then again,the Cold War was coming."},{"pageContent":"PART III [toc.xhtml#toc-part003]“The past is a foreign country.”—L. P. Hartley"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVEN [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter011]THE TICKING CLOCK [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter011]In the late summer of 1945, the Nazi scientist program underwent a significantorganizational change. At the behest of the State-War-Navy CoordinatingCommittee, control over the program was removed from the Military IntelligenceDivision [endnotes.xhtml#en0571] of the War Department, G-2, and given over tothe Joint Chiefs of Staff. The newly created Joint Intelligence ObjectivesAgency (JIOA) would now be in charge of decision making for the rapidlyexpanding classified program. The JIOA was a subcommittee of the JointIntelligence Committee, which provided national security information to theJoint Chiefs of Staff. To understand the JIOA’s power, and how it ran the Naziscientist program so secretively, is to first understand the nature of the JointIntelligence Committee. According to national security historian Larry A.Valero, who has written a monograph on the subject for the CIA, the JIC was andremains one of the most enigmatic of all the American intelligence agencies.“The JIC structure [endnotes.xhtml#en0572] was always in motion, always morphingand changing, a flexible, ad-hoc system,” Valero says. “Subcommittees came andwent, so did staff officers, but JIC decisions always had to be by consensus andwere always reported to the Joint Chiefs.” Little has been written about theinner workings of the JIOA, but the stories of individual Nazi scientists, andthe JIOA’s trail of partially declassified papers, help to define this powerfulpostwar organization.In the immediate aftermath of the German surrender, the Joint IntelligenceCommittee was focused on the emerging Soviet threat. Between June 15, 1945, andAugust 9, 1945, the JIC wrote and delivered sixteen major intelligence reportsand twenty-seven policy papers to the Joint Chiefs. “The most important JICestimates [endnotes.xhtml#en0573] involved the military capabilities and futureintentions of the USSR,” says Valero. Those intelligence estimates determinedthat the Soviets were ideologically hostile to the West and would continue toseek global domination, an attitude they had managed to skillfully concealduring the war. In September 1945, the JIC advised the Joint Chiefs that theSoviet Union would postpone “open conflict” [endnotes.xhtml#en0574] with theWest in the immediate future but only so it could rebuild its military arsenaland by 1952 be back at fighting strength. After this date, said the JIC, theSoviets would be ready and able to engage the United States in “total war.”The following month, JIC intelligence report 250/4 (the fourth report in the JIC250 series) warned the Joint Chiefs that “eight out of ten leading Germanscientists in the field of guided missiles” had recently gone missing fromGermany, had most likely been captured by the Soviets [endnotes.xhtml#en0575],and were now at work in the USSR. Similarly threatening, noted the report, twoGerman physics institutes had been seized by the Red Army and reassembled in theUSSR—not just the laboratories and the libraries but the scientists as well. JIC250/4 warned of “intensive Soviet scientific research programs” under way acrossRussia, all of which threatened the West. It was from within this environment ofintense suspicion that the JIOA was created. The Nazi scientist program was anaggressive U.S. military program from the moment the JIOA took control, just afew weeks after two atomic bombs ended the war with Japan. The employment ofGerman scientists was specifically and strategically aimed at achieving militarysupremacy over the Soviet Union before the Soviet Union was able to dominate theUnited States.Attaining supreme military power meant marshaling all the cutting-edge scienceand technology that could be culled from the ruins of the Reich. In the eyes ofmilitary intelligence, the fact that the scientists happened to be Nazis wasincidental—a troublesome detail. It had no bearing on the bigger plan. The clockwas ticking and, according to the Joint Intelligence Committee, would likely runout sometime around 1952.There was language in the existing Nazi scientist policy that now had to bedealt with by the JIOA. The phrase “no known or alleged war criminal” could notremain as part of policy nomenclature for long, nor could the phrase “no ardentNazis.” These words had been put there to appease a few generals in thePentagon, certain individuals in the State Department and moralists like Dr. H.P. Robertson, General Eisenhower’s chief of scientific intelligence. For theprogram to move forward according to this new strategy, the language needed tochange.With the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency now in control, a new, aggressiverecruitment process would begin. On its governing body [endnotes.xhtml#en0576],the JIOA had one representative of each member agency of the Joint IntelligenceCommittee: the army’s director of intelligence, the chief of naval intelligence,the assistant chief of Air Staff-2 (air force intelligence), and arepresentative from the State Department. The diplomat in the group wasoutnumbered by the military officers three to one.The State Department officer assigned to the JIOA was Samuel Klaus, and he wasperceived by his JIOA colleagues to be a troublemaker from day one. Samuel Klauswas a forty-two-year-old shining star in the State Department, a brilliantlawyer, avid horseman, and Hebrew scholar who also spoke Russian and German.Because Klaus was the man on the JIOA who was in charge of approving the visasfor all incoming German scientists, it was important that he be on board withwhat the JIOA wanted to accomplish. But Samuel Klaus was fundamentally opposedto the Nazi scientist program, and this created intense conflict within theJIOA.Klaus had hands-on experience [endnotes.xhtml#en0577] with Nazi Party ideology,owing to his wartime work for the U.S. Foreign Economic Administration duringthe war. During the war, Klaus ran Operation Safe Haven, a program withinternational reach designed to capture Nazi assets, including stolen art andgold being smuggled out of Germany for safekeeping in neutral countries. Duringhis years running Safe Haven, Klaus had interviewed hundreds of Germancivilians, and he had developed the belief that many “ordinary Germans” hadprofited from the Nazi Party and had had a tacit understanding of what washappening to the Jews. In his role as the State Department representative on theJIOA, Klaus argued that the Germans at issue were not brilliant scientists whohad been unwittingly caught in a maelstrom of evil but rather that they wereamoral opportunists of mediocre talent. JIOA records indicate that Klaus’ssentiments were shared [endnotes.xhtml#en0578] by at least two of his StateDepartment colleagues, including Herbert Cummings and Howard Travers. But it wasSamuel Klaus who was unabashedly vocal [endnotes.xhtml#en0579] about how he feltand what he believed. At a JIOA meeting in the late fall of 1945, Klaus vowedthat “less than a dozen [endnotes.xhtml#en0580] [German scientists] would everbe permitted to enter the U.S.” on his watch. For this, he was seen as a thornin the side of military intelligence and he was also outnumbered. Per the JIOA’scharter, it was required to share its plan with a cabinet-level advisory board,which included a representative from the Department of Commerce. As it sohappened, the representative from the Commerce Department, John C. Green, was anadvocate of the German scientist program, apparently without benefit of knowingwho these German scientists really were. In the fall of 1945 Green came up withan idea [endnotes.xhtml#en0581] that would undermine Samuel Klaus’s resistanceto Operation Overcast.After the war in Europe ended, President Truman put the Department of Commercein charge of a program designed to excite the nation about a unique form ofreparations being culled from the defeated German state, namely, the acquisitionof scientific and technical information. There would be no financialcompensation coming from Nazi Germany, the Department of Commerce explained, butAmerican industry could now benefit from a different kind of restitution[endnotes.xhtml#en0582]: knowledge. Secretary of Commerce (and former vicepresident) Henry Wallace had been appointed by the president to supervise therelease of thousands of what would become known as PB reports, named after theCommerce Department’s Office of the Publication Board. These reports containednon-armaments-related information collected by CIOS officers in Germany afterthe war. The idea behind the PB reports was to get average Americans to starttheir own small businesses inspired by German technological advances. These newbusinesses would be a boon to America’s postwar prosperity, the CommerceDepartment said.Thanks to Reich scientists, the public was told, beverage manufactures could nowsterilize fruit juice without heat. Women could enjoy run-proof hosiery. Buttercould be churned at the rate of 1,500 pounds per hour. These lists seemed not toend. Yeast could be produced in unlimited quantities, and wool could be pulledfrom sheepskins without injuring the animal’s hide—all because of brilliantGerman scientists. Hitler’s wizards had reduced suitcase-sized electricalcomponents to the size of a pinkie finger and pioneered electromagnetic tape.Henry Wallace was one of the nation’s greatest champions of the idea thatAmericans could find prosperity thanks to science. Wallace had served underRoosevelt in 1944, when Roosevelt promised Americans sixty million jobs[endnotes.xhtml#en0583]. The promise became the subject of a book by Wallace:Sixty Million Jobs. As secretary of commerce, he intended to make good on it.Business, industry, and government could work together to make the worldprosperous in peace, Wallace said. German science was a jumping-off point.The public was not made aware of a second list regarding captured Germanscientific and technical information, one marked classified. This listcatalogued eighteen hundred reports on German technology with militarypotential. Subject headings included [endnotes.xhtml#en0584]: “rockets,”“chemical warfare,” “medical practice,” “aeronautics,” “ordnance,”“insecticides,” and “physics, nuclear.” The man in charge of both lists[endnotes.xhtml#en0585]—the classified and the unclassified one—was HenryWallace’s executive secretary and his representative on the JIOA, John C. Green.Regarding the classified list [endnotes.xhtml#en0661], Green got an idea. Peaceand prosperity were, in principle, sound ideas. But there was big business inwar. Green wanted to make the classified list available to certain groups inindustry. “Specialized knowledge [endnotes.xhtml#en0586] [should not be] lockedup in the minds of German scientists and technicians,” Green said. It needed tobe shared. To help foster this sharing, in the fall of 1945 John C. Greentraveled to Wright Field, in Dayton, Ohio, to meet with Colonel Donald Putt.The first group of six [endnotes.xhtml#en0587] Germans brought to Wright Fieldin the fall of 1945 lived in an isolated and secure housing area called theHilltop, a cluster of five single-story wooden buildings and three smallcottages that had once housed the National Youth Administration. Almost no onebut the program’s administrators knew that the German scientists were there.There was a single-lane dirt road that passed by the Hilltop, used only bylocals who needed to visit the town dump. Trucks and station wagons filled withtrash sped by the Hilltop’s secret inhabitants, and when it rained the roadturned into a sea of mud. This annoyed the Germans, and they began compiling[endnotes.xhtml#en0588] a list of grievances to share with Colonel Putt at alater date. They knew better than to complain just yet. Considering the fate andcircumstances of many of their colleagues back in Germany, theirs was aparticularly good deal. But when the timing was right they would share this listof indignities, which would in turn affect the Nazi scientist program in themost unusual way.The original scientists at Wright Field [endnotes.xhtml#en0589] were listed asDr. Gerhard Braun, motor research; Dr. Theodor Zobel, aerodynamics; and Dr.Rudolph Edse, rocket fuels; the specialists were Mr. Otto Bock, supersonics; Mr.Hans Rister, aerodynamics; and Mr. Albert Patin, a businessman. Their salariesaveraged $12,480 a year, plus a $6.00 per diem—the equivalent of about $175,000in 2013. Because of an “oversight,” later caught and corrected, the Germans didnot pay U.S. taxes [endnotes.xhtml#en0590] for the first two years and twentymonths of the program.At the Hilltop [endnotes.xhtml#en0591], a husband-and-wife team of housekeeperslooked after the Germans’ domestic needs, washed their laundry, and made theirbeds. German prisoners of war who had already been brought to the United Statesand were not yet repatriated acted as cooks. The six scientists and specialistsand the others who would soon follow carried military-issue identification cardsthat had a large green “S” stamped on the front, indicating that they were notallowed to leave the base on their own. A gate running around the perimeter ofthe Hilltop was to be locked from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. each night. Onweekends, U.S. Army intelligence officers escorted the Germans into Dayton,where they could exercise at the local YMCA. A priest was brought in fromCincinnati to deliver Sunday mass in German. “We would like you to know and toappreciate that you are here in the interest of science and we hope that youwill work with us in close harmony to further develop and expand your varioussubjects of interest,” read the introductory pamphlet [endnotes.xhtml#en0592]issued to each specialist at Wright Field. “We have tried to make youcomfortable in the quarters assigned to you.”What the Germans craved most was respect, and this eluded them. During the warHitler’s scientists and industrialists had been treated with great admiration bythe Reich. Most scientists enjoyed financial reward. But here at Wright Field,many of the Germans’ American counterparts looked down on them with disdain.“The mere mention [endnotes.xhtml#en0593] of a German scientist is enough toprecipitate emotions in Air Corp personnel ranging from vehemence tofrustration,” one manager stated in an official classified report.As commanding general for intelligence at Wright Field, Colonel Donald Putt wasin charge of the German specialist program. Putt had great admiration for eachof the scientists, having handpicked [endnotes.xhtml#en0594] almost every one ofthem in Germany, at the Hermann Göring Aeronautical Research Center atVölkenrode, and elsewhere. He could not fathom why the specialists were lookedupon with contempt. “[A]ll they wanted was an opportunity to work,” Putt said.Colonel Putt’s vision for the Germans’ workload in America was threefold.Initially, he planned for the men to write reports on their past and futurework. Next, those reports would be translated and circulated among Americanengineers at Wright Field. Then Air Technical Service Command would holdresearch and development seminars at Wright Field, with invitations sent out todefense contractors, university laboratories, and any other interested partieswith Top Secret clearance and a contract with the Army Air Forces. But Putt’sidea came to a grinding halt after the War Department weighed in on hisproposal, responding to what it called “calculated risk.” The German scientistprogram was a highly classified military program and needed to remain secret. AWar Department memo [endnotes.xhtml#en0595] required that the Germans remain“properly segregated from persons not directly concerned with theirexploitation.” There was to be no fraternizing with American scientists.Collaboration with defense contractors and others was impossible at this pointin the program.The German specialists were offended [endnotes.xhtml#en0596] by the way theywere treated. Word from Dr. Herbert Wagner, inventor of the Hs 293 missile, wasthat Gould Castle on Long Island, where Wagner resided and worked, had marblebathtubs. Naval Intelligence allowed their German scientists to take field tripsinto Manhattan. The Germans at Wright Field told Putt they felt like “cagedanimals,” [endnotes.xhtml#en0597] and they demanded that something be done aboutit. Putt saw opportunity here. He wrote to Army Intelligence, G-2, to say thatthe Germans’ overall malaise was “critically affecting” their ability to work.When the Pentagon ignored Putt’s concerns, he appealed to Major Hugh Knerr, hiscommanding general at Air Technical Service Command. Knerr wrote to thePentagon. “Intangibles of a scientist’s daily life [endnotes.xhtml#en0598]directly affect the quality of his product,” he said, but this too had littleeffect. In Washington the general feeling was that Operation Overcast wastemporary and that the Germans should be happy to have jobs. Besides, theNuremberg trials were about to begin [endnotes.xhtml#en0601].On October 18, 1945, an indictment was lodged by the International MilitaryTribunal against the defendants named as major war criminals. The trial wouldtake place inside the east wing of the Nuremberg Palace of Justice, with openingstatements beginning November 20. Because this was a military tribunal,sentences would be passed by judges, not jurors. Nuremberg as a city had playeda unique role in the rise of the Nazi Party. It had been the site of Hitler’sNazi Party rallies—colossal military parades supported by as many as 400,000Nazi loyalists—and home to the Nuremberg race laws. Now the leaders in theregime would be tried in this location for conspiracy, crimes against peace, warcrimes, and crimes against humanity.As the trial began, twenty-one defendants sat crammed onto two benches, insideCourtroom 600, headphones over their ears. (There were twenty-two defendants;Martin Bormann was tried in absentia.) Behind them on the wall, symbolicallypositioned over their heads, was a large marble statue of the hideous monsterMedusa [endnotes.xhtml#en0599]. The twenty-one present [endnotes.xhtml#en0600]faced the death penalty if convicted. “The wrongs which we seek to condemn andpunish have been so calculated, so malignant, and so devastating,” Chief U.S.Prosecutor Justice Robert H. Jackson famously declared, “that civilizationcannot tolerate their being ignored, because it cannot survive their beingrepeated.” The trial would last almost a year. With stories about Nuremberg andthe Nazi war crimes dominating world news, complaints about comfort from theGermans at Wright Field meant very little to the War Department General Staff.The same month the Nuremberg trial opened, in October 1945, the Army Air Forceshosted a grand two-day-long fair at Wright Field. On display were capturedGerman and Japanese aircraft and rockets seen by the public for the first timesince war’s end. Over half a million people from twenty-six countries came tomarvel at the confiscated enemy equipment, said to be worth $150 million. Amongthe items on display were the V-2 rocket, the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 G3 fighteraircraft, and the Messerschmitt Me 262. Particularly fascinating to the publicwas that some of the airplanes still had swastikas painted on their tails[endnotes.xhtml#en0602]. The fair was so popular that the Army Air Forcesextended it for five days. There was no mention made of the fact that several ofthe men who had designed and engineered these weapons were living a stone’sthrow away, at the Hilltop.Among the half-million visitors at the fair was John C. Green, the CommerceDepartment’s representative on the JIOA advisory board and its executivesecretary overseeing the PB reports. The board had just changed its name to theOffice of Technical Services, underscoring its transformation from a passive“board” to a more active “service” that would make use of cutting-edge science[endnotes.xhtml#en0603] and technology. As planned, Green tracked down ColonelPutt at the Wright Field Fair. He had a myriad of questions for Putt[endnotes.xhtml#en0604], all of which centered around one idea: How could allthis science and technology on display benefit American industry moving forward?Initially, Putt was uneasy about Green’s attention, but in the end he decided totake a gamble on him. After all, John C. Green had access to the classifiedlist. Putt shared with him some information about the German scientists on theHilltop. How they were like men kept in an ivory tower, how their talents weresquandered by policy and prejudice in some circles in Washington, D.C. Theyneeded employment opportunities, Putt lamented. Perhaps Green could help?Green seemed amenable, and Putt took note. “During his visit to the Air ForcesFair, Wright Field, [John C. Green] evidenced keen interest and inquired as tothe reaction of industry toward the possible employment of German scientists,”Putt wrote in a memo [endnotes.xhtml#en0605]. He was not yet clear if Green’s“influence is favorable or unfavorable.” But Putt decided to take the risk. Heforwarded to Green several “letters of interest [endnotes.xhtml#en0607]” fromdefense contractors regarding potential employment of the German scientists.These documents had already been received by Air Material Command[endnotes.xhtml#en0606]. They included letters from Dow Chemical Company, theAiResearch Manufacturing Company, and the Aircraft Industries Association.Defense contracts meant that there was business in the wings waiting to betransacted. It was Washington, D.C., that stood in the way. Putt explained toGreen that these private businesses did not have a high enough securityclearance to deal directly with the German scientists themselves.John C. Green wrote to JIOA explaining what he had in mind: German scientists of“international repute” should be allowed, with their families, to enter theUnited States for long-term work, argued Green. This was good for Americanbusinesses. The letters from the defense contractors indicated that there was agreat demand for this kind of work. The Commerce Department would set up a boardto weed out the Nazis and bring the good Germans in. The German scientists’knowledge and know-how would be “fully and freely” available to all Americans,said Green. This boom to industry would help create tens of thousands ofAmerican jobs.Inside the JIOA, reactions were mixed, particularly among advisory boardmembers. The assistant secretary of the interior was skeptical as to howCommerce could guarantee to keep old Nazis out of the program. The WarDepartment did not like the idea of having to bring the families to America.Army Intelligence felt Green’s proposal had validity from an economicperspective. If Commerce got involved in the German scientist program, the armywould not necessarily have to shoulder so much of the financial burden. TheState Department continued to voice objections [endnotes.xhtml#en0608], sayingthat regardless of who footed the bill, visas were not going to be granted toformer enemies of the state without thorough and individual investigations. TheNazi scientist program was a temporary military program [endnotes.xhtml#en0609],State said. Nothing more.John C. Green had an alternative plan. Instead of arguing his case further tothe JIOA advisory board, he appealed to his boss, Henry Wallace. In turn, HenryWallace wrote directly to President Truman, requesting that the presidentsupport the German science program. Science would help create those sixtymillion jobs, Wallace said, and nothing had a higher national priority inpeacetime than American jobs. It was “wise and logical” to bring to America“scientists of outstanding attainments who can make a positive contribution toour scientific and industrial efforts,” Wallace wrote to President Truman onDecember 4, 1945. The knowledge these men possessed, Wallace said, “if added toour own would advance the frontiers of scientific knowledge for nationalbenefit.” To illustrate his point, Wallace used one of the most benignscientists in all of Germany, a concrete and road construction expert named Dr.O. Graff, who had helped design the autobahn. “If you agree that the importanceof a selected few (approximately 50 in number) would be an asset to our economy,I suggest you declare that this to be U.S. policy,” Wallace urged the president[endnotes.xhtml#en0610].For Colonel Donald Putt at Wright Field and the military intelligence members ofthe JIOA, Henry Wallace’s endorsement of the program was like a shot in the arm.Before Wallace’s letter to the president, Samuel Klaus of the State Departmenthad suggested that the public would be outraged by the program once they foundout about it [endnotes.xhtml#en0611]. It could not stay secret forever, nor wasit meant to. Klaus had said that bringing Hitler’s former scientists to Americafor weapons research and development gave the impression that the army and thenavy were willing to make deals with the devil for national security gains.Henry Wallace’s economically minded endorsement changed all that. It gave theGerman scientists program an air of democracy [endnotes.xhtml#en0612], offeringcounterbalance to what could be perceived as an aggressive military program.Henry Wallace had been staunchly anti-Nazi during the war. Preceding Truman inthe vice presidency, Wallace had publicly called Hitler a “supreme deviloperating through a human form.” In another famous speech, he had likened Hitlerto Satan [endnotes.xhtml#en0613] seven times. That Henry Wallace was encouragingPresident Truman to endorse the German scientist program in the name of economicprosperity gave Operation Overcast a future. Henry Wallace was exactly what theJIOA had been waiting for.On November 4, 1945, a headline in the Washington Post caught the nation’sattention: “Army Uncovers Lurid Nazi ‘Science’ of Freezing Men.” The article,written by reporter George Connery, was a major news scoop[endnotes.xhtml#en0614]. In an effort to garner support for subsequent militarytrials in Nuremberg, the War Department had leaked to Connery the secret CIOSreport written by war crimes investigator Dr. Leo Alexander. The reportchronicled the freezing experiments conducted at Dachau inside Experimental CellBlock Five. That human beings had been tortured to death by German physicians inthe name of medical science was both horrifying and incomprehensible to mostAmericans. The Post article revealed that the only man believed to have survivedthe freezing experiments had been located by Dr. Leo Alexander. Most of theother victims—the so-called Untermenschen whom the Nazi doctors had experimentedon—died in the process or were killed. It was likely that this sole survivingvictim, a Catholic priest, would provide witness testimony in the Nurembergcourts. Americans were rapt.Kept secret from the public was an astonishing hypocrisy. Less than 150 milesfrom the Nuremberg courtroom, several of the physicians who had participated in,and many others who were accessory to, these criminal medical experiments werenow being employed by the U.S. Army at the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center,the classified research facility in Heidelberg. This laboratory, dreamed up byColonel Harry Armstrong [endnotes.xhtml#en0619] and Major General Malcolm Growat a meeting [endnotes.xhtml#en0615] in France in the spring of 1945, wouldremain one of the best-kept secrets of Operation Paperclip for decades to come.Here, starting on September 20, 1945, fifty-eight doctors handpicked by Dr.Strughold had been working on medical research projects begun for the ThirdReich. Some of the data the Nazi doctors were using in their new Army researchhad been obtained in experiments in which test subjects had been murdered.For Grow and Armstrong, the plan was to have these Luftwaffe doctors reconfigurethe results of their war work in Heidelberg under army supervision[endnotes.xhtml#en0616]. The follow-on plan [endnotes.xhtml#en0617] was forthese doctors to come to the United States under Paperclip contracts. Becauseconducting military research inside Germany was a violation of Allied ControlCouncil Law 25 [endnotes.xhtml#en0618] of the Potsdam Accord, the Aero MedicalCenter’s classified nature shielded the Nazi doctors from chance exposure.The codirectors of the secret research facility, Colonel Harry Armstrong and Dr.Hubertus Strughold, were alike in many ways, so much so that some saw the twomen as mirror images of one another. The growing success of the Aero MedicalCenter would prove to be a launching point for each man’s meteoric postwarcareer. Armstrong would eventually be promoted to U.S. surgeon general of theair force. Strughold would become the father of U.S. space medicine.Harry Armstrong, born in 1899, entered into the U.S. military when horses werestill being ridden into battle. During World War I Armstrong learned how todrive a six-mule ambulance and decided to become a doctor. After receiving hismedical degree from the University of Louisville, he opened a private practicein Minneapolis. He might have become a country doctor, but he was preoccupied byairplanes and dirigibles. Appointed first lieutenant in the Medical CorpsReserve, Armstrong entered the School of Aviation Medicine (SAM) at BrooksField, in San Antonio, Texas, in 1924. In 1925 he decided to specialize in afield of medicine few had ever heard of, and soon he would become a flightsurgeon. He had never flown in an airplane before.It was a master sergeant named Erwin H. Nickles who inspired Armstrong[endnotes.xhtml#en0620] to make his first parachute jump. In a lecture that tookplace in a parachute hangar, Nickles presented the idea that one day entiretroops of infantrymen just might jump out of airplanes into combat situations asa group. After the class was over, Armstrong got in a long conversation withNickles. “He told me that he was puzzled by the fact that people who hesupervised in practice jumps almost invariably failed to follow his instructionwhich was to count ten after leaving the airplane before pulling the rip cord,”Armstrong explained. He said that Nickles feared jumpers would “black out or getinto a panic and pull the rip cord too quickly.” When Nickles “hinted[endnotes.xhtml#en0621] that he would be very happy if some doctor would make ajump to see if they could solve his problem,” Armstrong’s mind was made up. “Idecided I would make a practice jump and delay my opening as long as possible.”A few weeks later Armstrong was standing in the cockpit of a biplane, wearing aflying suit and a gabardine helmet and getting ready to jump. “I had a feelingof panic,” Armstrong explained, but he hurled himself out of the aircraftanyway. As he fell through the air he kept his eyes closed and paid attention towhat his body felt like as he descended. The feeling of panic disappeared, helater recalled. He did not lose consciousness or black out. Armstrong allowedhimself to free-fall for approximately twelve hundred feet before he finallypulled the ripcord. His parachute opened and he floated the last one thousandfeet to earth, where he landed in a grassy Texas field. Harry Armstrong had seta U.S. Army record. He was the first flight surgeon to make a free fall from anaircraft.Armstrong finished school and returned to Minnesota, but with an insatiable loveof flying. On March 21, 1930, he closed his practice in Minneapolis[endnotes.xhtml#en0622] and joined the army for good. His life as one of themost important figures in the history of American aviation and aerospacemedicine had begun.When Armstrong arrived with his family at Wright Field [endnotes.xhtml#en0623],in 1934, the world was enamored with airplanes, which were not yet associatedwith war but with peacetime progress and the spirit of adventure. JimmyDoolittle set a transcontinental record flying from California to New Jersey ineleven hours, sixteen minutes. Wiley Post and Harold Gatty circled the globe ineight days. At Wright Field, the primary task of the flight surgeon wasdetermining who was physically fit to fly in the airplanes of the day. Armstrongwas a man with a vision and he was also a soldier. He envisioned a future[endnotes.xhtml#en0624] where wars would be fought in the air. The Army AirCorps’ most advanced fighter aircraft was a biplane with a speed of around 200miles per hour and a flight ceiling of 18,000 feet. Armstrong’s work centeredaround resolving problems related to oxygen deprivation and exposure to cold.One day Armstrong spotted a trapdoor [endnotes.xhtml#en0625] in the floor of hisoffice inside Building 16 at Wright Field. He opened the door, saw a staircase,and climbed down. He found himself in a basement filled with old machinery anddrafting tables. An unusual-looking chamber [endnotes.xhtml#en0626], likesomething out of a novel by Jules Verne, caught his eye. It was shaped like aglobe, made of iron, and had windows like submarine portholes. This was thearmy’s first and only low-pressure chamber, built decades earlier for its WorldWar I flight surgeon school. The school, located in Mineola, Long Island, hadclosed down after the war and the chamber had wound up here, at Wright Field.Armstrong got an idea. Next door to his office, Army Air Forces engineers weredesigning airplanes that could fly faster, higher, and farther than ever before.Armstrong wanted to begin research and development on the medical effects thatflying these new airplanes would have on pilots. He wrote a letter to theengineering division [endnotes.xhtml#en0627]at Wright Field requestingpermission. The letter was forwarded to Washington. In no time, Armstrong wasappointed director of the Physiological Research Unit (later called the AeroMedical Research Laboratory and other variations on the name) at Wright Field.His lab took off. Shop mechanics built test chambers from old airplane parts. Hehired a scientist from Harvard, a PhD named John “Bill” Heim. Using volunteertest subjects, Heim and Armstrong gathered data on how the body responds tospeed, lower oxygen levels, and decompression sickness and extreme temperatures.But it was an experiment on himself, with a rabbit on his lap, for whichArmstrong became legendary.He had been wondering what really happened to the human body above 10,000 feet.Why, and at what specific height, would a man die? Armstrong climbed into thelow-pressure chamber with the rabbit on his lap. His technician adjusted thepressure to simulate high altitude. Armstrong’s chest began to tighten and hisjoints hurt. When he rubbed his hands, he felt tiny bubbles along his tendons,ones that he could move around under his skin. He surmised that these werenitrogen bubbles forming in his blood and tissues, and that death at highaltitude was caused by [endnotes.xhtml#en0628] blood clotting. Armstrongindicated to the technician that he should simulate an even higher altitudeinside the chamber. He was wearing an oxygen mask, but the rabbit on his lap wasnot. Soon the rabbit would be dead. As the lab technician raised the pressure,the rabbit convulsed and died. When Armstrong got out of the chamber, hedissected the rabbit [endnotes.xhtml#en0629] and found nitrogen bubbles, provingthat his hypothesis was correct.Armstrong’s discovery [endnotes.xhtml#en0630] gave way to a major milestone inaviation medicine. Working with Heim on more tests, he inserted a viewing tubeinto the artery of a test animal. The two men took data on what happens to amammal’s body at forty thousand, fifty thousand, and finally sixty-five thousandfeet. They were the first to witness that body fluids boil at sixty-threethousand feet. This point would become known as the Armstrong line. This is thealtitude beyond which humans cannot survive without a pressure suit.In 1937, Captain Harry Armstrong was considered one of America’s aviationmedicine pioneers. On October 2 of that year he attended the Aero MedicalAssociation’s first international convention, which took place in the AstorGallery of the Waldorf-Astoria hotel. There, he and Heim reported the results oftheir recent studies at Wright Field. One of the doctors most interested inthese studies was the Luftwaffe physician representing Germany, Dr. HubertusStrughold. The two men, Armstrong and Strughold, were pioneers in the samefield. “We hit it off immediately,” remembered Harry Armstrong decades later.That fortuitous meeting would profoundly shape Strughold’s post-Nazi career.Some men claim to be shaped by a single event. For Hubertus Strughold, it waswatching Halley’s Comet [endnotes.xhtml#en0631] streak across the sky from hisbackyard tree house in Westtünnen, Germany, in 1910. Forever after, saidStrughold, he became preoccupied with what lies above. That same year, a secondevent shaped the rest of his life. Strughold watched a solar eclipse through aviewing glass and nearly went blind. The lens wasn’t as dark as he thought itwas and he burned the retina of his right eye, causing permanent damage. “When Ilooked [endnotes.xhtml#en0632] at somebody with the right eye, at his nose, hehad no nose.… When I looked at somebody at the street, at a distance of about ahundred meters at somebody’s head [with the right eye], he did not have anyhead. It was always clear with both eyes,” Strughold later explained. HubertusStrughold had learned the hard way that experiments using one’s own body couldbe dangerous. Still, as a young man, he pursued auto-experimentation[endnotes.xhtml#en0633] with vigor and imagination. In college he studiedphysics, anatomy, and zoology, but it was physiology that interested him most,the functions of living organisms and their parts.At the University of Würzburg Strughold taught the world’s first college courseon the effects high altitude had on the human body. His experimental test datacame from himself. On weekends he flew hot air balloons, recording everythingfrom vision to ear pressure to muscle effects. Inside the flying balloon,Professor Strughold recorded how his body responded to rapid acceleration anddescent, which in turn made him curious to know how he would feel during radicalbanking turns. For that he needed an airplane. Strughold found the perfectmentor in a World War I flying ace by the name of Robert Ritter von Greim.Von Greim was a legend. Renowned for his fearlessness in battle, in World War Ihe had recorded twenty-eight kills. In the 1920s and 1930s he was considered oneof the top pilots in Germany and performed a variety of flight-related jobs,including exhibition dogfights against fellow World War I flying ace Ernst Udet.When Adolf Hitler needed a pilot [endnotes.xhtml#en0634] to fly him from Munichto Berlin for the Kapp Putsch coup attempt in 1920, he chose Robert Ritter vonGreim for the job. In 1926, von Greim was hired by Chiang Kai-shek to set up theChinese air force in Canton, China. Returning to Germany, von Greim opened aflight school, located at the top of a mountain in Galgenberg, two miles fromwhere Hubertus Strughold taught aviation medicine to college students.Strughold hired von Greim to teach him how to fly, paying him six marks perlesson. The two men became fast friends. In Robert Ritter von Greim, HubertusStrughold found a brilliant match—another man willing to push pilot performanceto the edge of unconsciousness. The men would strap themselves into harnesses invon Greim’s open cockpit airplane and fly loops and rolls in the skies overGalgenberg. Strughold kept track of their physiological reactions to extremeflight, seeking answers to questions. Can a man draw a straight line whileflying upside down? Can a pilot mark a bull’s-eye on a piece of paperimmediately after a barrel roll? With how little oxygen could a man legiblywrite his name? How far up can a man fly before his vision fades? Von Greim waschallenged by Strughold’s strange requests, and he was willing to fly faster andhigher as his new young physician friend recorded data on von Greim’s pilotperformance and physical capabilities in the air. Strughold knew his tests wereoriginal and hoped they would attract interest from the United States. In 1928his wish came true when he received a prestigious fellowship from theRockefeller Foundation. Strughold packed his bags [endnotes.xhtml#en0635],boarded the SS Dresden, and headed to New York.Hubertus Strughold took to America like a fish to water, he later explained. Asa Rockefeller Foundation fellow at the University of Chicago, he was at thecenter of the music scene in the roaring twenties. Listening to jazz music washis favorite pastime after flying. In Chicago he attended vaudeville shows,parties, and dances and became fluent in English. He loved to drink and almostalways smoked. His thick German accent distinguished him from everyone elsearound and made most people remember him. His first scientific paper in Englishwas on oxygen deficiency and how to revive a heart using electric shock. Forresearch he used dogs as test subjects, importing them from Canada at a timewhen experimenting on dogs from the United States was illegal. Strugholdattended conferences in Boston and visited the laboratories at Harvard, at theMayo Clinic in Minnesota, and at Columbia University in New York. And he met andbecame friendly with American aviation medicine pioneers like Harry Armstrong.The Rockefeller fellowship lasted only a year. Back in Germany, Strughold andvon Greim took up where they left off. Von Greim was now flying a double-deckerUdet Flamingo aircraft, an aerobatic sports biplane made of wood. To determinehow many g-forces a man could take before his eyeballs suffered damage, the twomen would climb high in the air, then dive down toward the ground until one ofthem blacked out [endnotes.xhtml#en0636].Von Greim’s longtime friend and colleague Adolf Hitler took power in 1933. Insecret, von Greim was called upon by Hermann Göring to rebuild the German AirForce, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. Through his personal friendshipwith von Greim, Strughold ingratiated himself into this inner circle of Nazipower. In 1935 he was offered a job that would shape the rest of his life. Asdirector of the Aviation Medical Research Institute of the Reich Air Ministry inBerlin, he was now in the uppermost echelon of Luftwaffe medical research. Thelab, located in the suburb of Charlottenburg, featured a state-of-the-artlow-pressure chamber and a ten-foot centrifuge in which test subjects could beexposed to varying degrees of gravitational pull. The chamber could take bothapes and humans [endnotes.xhtml#en0637] to between fifteen and twenty Gs.The job required time, commitment, and most of all dedication. The Reich neededthe Luftwaffe to help conquer all of Europe. This was why Strughold had packedhis bags and moved to Berlin. He would report directly to Erich Hippke, chief ofthe Luftwaffe’s medical corps, who reported to Hermann Göring. This was avertical career move for Strughold. He’d gone from a university teaching post tothe top of the Reich’s aviation medicine chain of command. The Reich had vastresources and a desire to conduct groundbreaking experiments for the benefit ofits pilots. There were risks but with risks came rewards. For Strughold, thereward was monumental. For ten years he enjoyed a career as one of the mostpowerful physicians working for the Third Reich.In Berlin, Strughold treated his expansive new laboratory as a haven for risktakers [endnotes.xhtml#en0638]. Colleagues, including officials from the NaziParty [endnotes.xhtml#en0639] and the SS, would stop by to marvel over his workwith the low-pressure chamber and the centrifuge. Experiments were almost alwaysin progress. Strughold’s medical assistants were forever allowing themselves tobe hooked up to these odd-looking contraptions with pipes, valves, and hosesprojecting from all sides. Assistants, one with and one without an oxygen mask,would allow themselves to be locked inside the low-pressure chamber in order todetermine how high up a man could go before becoming unconscious. During oneexperiment, two officials with the Reich Air Ministry were on hand to observe.The man without the oxygen mask began to lose consciousness. First his eyesclosed, then his head fell to his chest. The second man inside the chamber,wearing a mask, administered first aid. It did not take long for the man toquickly recover.“Our studies are all very risky [endnotes.xhtml#en0640],” Strughold told theNazi Party officials. “They require great ability on the part of the assistantsand great responsibility. If the man did not get oxygen… he might be dead infive minutes.”As the Luftwaffe prepared its pilots for war, Strughold continued to use hisstaff as test subjects. He also experimented on himself. He was said to have“ridden the centrifuge” for a full two minutes, simulating what it would be liketo experience fifteen times the force of gravity while flying an airplane.After Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, the war spread into areas ofextreme climates, from Norway to North Africa to the Russian front. These newcombat theaters created urgent new medical problems for the Reich, most notablyfor foot soldiers but also for the Luftwaffe. As the war progressed and theLuftwaffe unveiled one new airplane after the next, the pilot physiologychallenges grew [endnotes.xhtml#en0641]. By 1940 new engine systems were beingdeveloped, including turbo and jet engines, with countless pilot parameters toexplore, including the effects of speed, lower oxygen levels, decompressionsickness, and extreme temperatures on the body. A web of institutions sprang upacross Germany and its newly conquered lands, all financed by the deep pocketsof the Reich Research Council, and including Strughold’s Aviation MedicalResearch Institute in Berlin. The institute worked hand in hand with twoLuftwaffe facilities close by, and Strughold developed strong relationships withthe director of each institute: Dr. Theodor Benzinger [endnotes.xhtml#en0642],of the Experimental Station of the Air Force Research Center at Rechlin, and Dr.Siegfried Ruff, of the German Experimental Station for Aviation Medicine, AeroMedical division, in Berlin.This is why, after the war, when Strughold was asked by Colonel Armstrong to bethe codirector of the classified AAF Aero Medical facility in Heidelberg,Strughold asked Benzinger and Ruff to come along. He put each man in charge[endnotes.xhtml#en0643] of one of the four areas of aviation research at the newfacility. They trusted one another. They all had the same secrets to protect.Dr. Theodor Benzinger was tall, thin as a rail, 5′11″ and just 138 pounds. Hehad dark blue eyes, sharp, angular features, and kept his black hair slickedback, with a pencil part. Born in 1905, Benzinger was described, in his armyintelligence dossier, as “an old school Prussian, willful, self-serving andwilling to get what he wants by any means.” At Heidelberg he was put in chargeof a department that developed oxygen equipment for airplanes. Benzinger was acommitted Nazi [endnotes.xhtml#en0644] and had been from the earliest days ofNational Socialism. He joined the Nazi Party the year Hitler took power, in1933. He was also a member of the SA, holding the position of medical sergeantmajor. He and his wife, Ilse Benzinger, were members of the NSV, the NaziParty’s so-called social welfare organization, which was overseen by Reichpropaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Ilse was active in NSV-sponsored programslike Mother and Child, whereby unwed German mothers could birth Aryan childrenon bucolic baby farms.In 1934, the twenty-nine-year-old Dr. Benzinger was made department chief of theExperimental Station of the Air Force Research Center. Like Harry Armstrong,Benzinger predicted that pilots would fly high-altitude missions to sixtythousand feet sometime in the near future. In service of this idea[endnotes.xhtml#en0645] Benzinger and his staff at Rechlin researchedhigh-altitude durability and explosive decompression. They took great risksexperimenting on themselves. On one occasion, one of Benzinger’s techniciansdied as a result of complications from oxygen deprivation experienced inside alow-pressure chamber. In addition to researching aviation medicine[endnotes.xhtml#en0646], Benzinger became a pilot and served as a colonel in theLuftwaffe. He flew reconnaissance and combat missions over the British Isles. In1939, showing “bravery before the enemy” Benzinger was awarded the Iron Cross,Class I and Class II.In Heidelberg, at the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center, Strughold put Dr.Siegfried Ruff in charge of work involving the effect g-forces have on humanbeings. This was work that Ruff had begun at the test center in Rechlin with Dr.Benzinger during the war. Ruff did not have the same striking looks as hiscolleague, Dr. Benzinger. Ruff’s smiling, professorial posture made it hard toimagine he had spent so much time supervising medical experiments inside theDachau concentration camp, including Rascher’s murderous high-altitude studiesin Experimental Cell Block Five. Like Benzinger, Ruff was an avowed anddedicated [endnotes.xhtml#en0647] Nazi. He joined the party in 1938. Thefacility Dr. Ruff was in charge of for the Third Reich was located just tenmiles across town from the institute that Dr. Strughold oversaw[endnotes.xhtml#en0648]. As the directors of the two most important Luftwaffemedical facilities in Berlin, Ruff and Strughold collaborated closely on anumber of projects during the war.Ruff and Strughold coauthored several papers [endnotes.xhtml#en0649] togetherand coedited Aviation Medicine (Luftfahrtmedizin). One of the articles theycowrote so fascinated the U.S. Army Air Corps that in 1942 intelligence officershad it translated and circulated among flight surgeons at Wright Field. The twomen also coauthored a book [endnotes.xhtml#en0650] called the Compendium onAviation Medicine, which served as a kind of handbook for Luftwaffe flightsurgeons and included articles on explosive decompression and oxygen deficiency.At Heidelberg, Dr. Ruff was in charge of this work again, only now it was paidfor by the U.S. Army.Working directly under Dr. Ruff at the Aero Medical Center was Dr. KonradSchäfer, listed in declassified documents as also researching the effects ofg-forces on the body. This was not Schäfer’s primary area of expertise. Hiswartime research work [endnotes.xhtml#en0651], which had been supported by boththe Nazi Party’s Reich Research Council and the Luftwaffe, was the pathology ofthirst. Schäfer was a tall man, slightly overweight with a receding hairline andthick-lensed glasses that made him appear slightly cross-eyed. Unlike most ofhis colleagues, Schäfer avoided joining the Nazi Party, which he later said costhim jobs. In 1941 he was drafted and sent to a Luftwaffe air base at Frankfurton the Oder. When his talents as a chemist came to light—he’d worked as chiefphysiological chemist for the firm Schering AG—Schäfer was transferred to Berlinand given an assignment in Luftwaffe sea emergencies. “This included research onvarious methods to render seawater potable,” Schäfer later explained under oath.Sea emergencies were an area of great concern. As the man in charge of aviationmedical research for the Luftwaffe, Dr. Strughold had solutions to seaemergencies high on his priority list. During the air war, every pilot knew thatdrinking ocean water destroyed the kidneys and brought death faster thansuffering indomitable thirst. But German pilots shot down over the sea andawaiting rescue were known to break down and drink seawater anyway. TheLuftwaffe announced a contest. Any doctor or chemist who could develop a methodto separate the salt from seawater would be greatly rewarded. Konrad Schäfer,one of Strughold’s protégés in Berlin, aimed to solve that conundrum. Schäferworked “in co-operation with IG Farben to create Wolfen, a mixture from bariumand silver zeolith,” he later explained, which he synthesized into “a tabletnamed Wolfatit [which] was developed to separate the salt in a residue.” Theresults produced drinkable water, which was a remarkable achievement. Schäferhad succeeded where so many other doctors and chemists had failed.Dr. Oskar Schröder, head of the Luftwaffe Medical Corps, was thrilled. KonradSchäfer had “developed a process which actually precipitated the salts from thesea water,” Schröder later testified. But another group of Luftwaffe doctorswere already backing a different process, called the Berka method, which was badnews for the Schäfer process. “It was thought by the Chief of the LuftwaffeMedical Service to be too bulky and expensive,” Schröder explained.A second contest was proposed [endnotes.xhtml#en0652]; this one to see whichdesalination method was superior. The effectiveness of both the Schäfer processand the Berka method would be tested on the Untermenschen at Dachau. A Luftwaffephysician named Hermann Becker-Freyseng was assigned to assist Dr. Schäfer, andto coauthor with him a paper documenting the results of the contest. The seniordoctor advising Becker-Freyseng and Schäfer in their work was Dr. SiegfriedRuff. The resultant paper, called “Thirst and Thirst Quenching in EmergencySituations at Sea,” described saltwater medical experiments conducted onprisoners inside Experimental Cell Block Five.Dr. Hermann Becker-Freyseng had been a member of the Nazi Party since 1938. Hisspecialty was oxygen poisoning in the human body. An odd-looking man,Becker-Freyseng’s unusually large ears gave the appearance of handles on eitherside of his head. During the war Becker-Freyseng served as chief of theDepartment for Aviation Medicine and Medical Services in the Luftwaffe, anotherbranch under an umbrella of medical facilities and laboratories overseen by Dr.Strughold. Becker-Freyseng was held in great esteem [endnotes.xhtml#en0653] byhis colleagues, many of whom, under interrogation, described him as “heroic” forthe masochistic extremes he was willing to go in auto-experimentation.Becker-Freyseng conducted over one hundred experiments on himself, many of whichrendered him unconscious. At least one took him to the brink of death. The storyrepeated most often about Becker-Freyseng was of a self-experiment he did in achamber [endnotes.xhtml#en0654], also with a rabbit. Determined to learn howmuch oxygen would poison a man, Becker-Freyseng went into a low-pressure chamberwith a rabbit with the goal of staying inside for three days. A few hours shy ofhis goal, Becker-Freyseng began to show symptoms of paralysis[endnotes.xhtml#en0655]. “The rabbit died, Becker-Freyseng recuperated,”Strughold later explained under oath. That was all during the war. Now Ruff,Benzinger, Schäfer, Schröder, and Becker-Freyseng, with the approval ofStrughold and Armstrong, continued their work [endnotes.xhtml#en0656] on secretaviation medical projects initially conceived for Hitler’s war machine.The Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center in Heidelberg was a squat, brick,two-story facility facing the Neckar River. Only a few months prior it had beenthe Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research, a bastion of Nazi sciencewhere chemists and physicists worked on projects for the Reich’s war machine. Atits front entrance, the Reich’s flag came down and the U.S. flag went up.Photographs of Hitler were pulled from the walls and replaced by framedphotographs of Army Air Forces generals in military pose[endnotes.xhtml#en0657]. Most of the furniture stayed the same. In the diningroom German waiters in white servers’ coats provided table service at mealtimes.A single 5″ x 8″ requisition receipt, dated September 14, 1945, made thetransition official: “This property [endnotes.xhtml#en0658] is needed by U.S.Forces, and the requisition is in proportion to the resources of the country.”The mission statement of the project, classified Top Secret, was succinct: “theexploitation of certain uncompleted German aviation medical research projects.”Dr. Strughold was put in charge of hiring doctors, “all of whom are consideredauthorities in a particular field of medicine.”Across the American zone of Germany, entire laboratories were dismantled andreassembled here at the secret facility in Heidelberg. More than twenty tons ofmedical research equipment was salvaged from the Tempelhof Airport, in Berlin,including a “huge human centrifuge… and a low pressure chamber the length oftwo, ordinary Pullman cars.” There was equipment here [endnotes.xhtml#en0659]that American physicians had never seen before: esoteric items including a NagelAnomaloscope, a Zeiss-made interferometer, an Engelking-Hartung adaptometer, aSchmidt-Haensch photometer, and a precision-built Siemens electronmicroscope—with which to study night vision, blood circulation, g-forces, andthe bends. Even the low-pressure chamber from Georg Weltz’s research facility atFreising, near the Munich dairy farm, was brought to Heidelberg. This was thelaboratory where Dr. Leo Alexander had experienced his revelation that Nazidoctors had been freezing people to death.It was a precarious time for doctors who had previously worked for the Reich.With the Nuremberg trial under way, the international press had its attentionfocused on war crimes. German doctors were looked at with suspicion. Articlesabout Nazi doctors, including the November 1945 piece in the Washington Postabout the “science” of freezing humans, put a spotlight on German medicine. Manydoctors fled the country to South America through escape routes called ratlines.Others tried to blend in by offering their services in displaced-persons camps.Some killed themselves. Maximilian de Crinis, chief of the psychiatricdepartment at the University Charité in Berlin, swallowed a cyanide capsule inthe last days of the war. Ernst-Robert Grawitz, physician for the SS andpresident of the German Red Cross, killed himself and his family, including hisyoung children, by detonating a small bomb inside his house outside Berlin. TheReich Health Leader, Leonardo Conti, hanged himself in his cell at Nuremberg.Ernst Holzlöhner, the senior doctor at the University of Berlin who conductedthe freezing experiments at Dachau with Sigmund Rascher, committed suicide inJune 1945 after being interrogated by British investigators.The list of suicides was long, but the number of German doctors believed[endnotes.xhtml#en0660] to have been involved in war crimes was even longer. TheU.S. war crimes office for the chief counsel wrote up a list of doctors involvedin medical research that resulted in “mercy killings,” a euphemism used by theReich for its medical murder programs. The list was classified with a strictcaveat that access to it remain “restricted for 80 years from the date ofcreation.” This meant that, by the time the world would know who was on thislist, it would be the year 2025, and everyone named would be dead.A copy of the list was given to the commander of the Army Air Forces AeroMedical Center, Robert J. Benford. Five doctors working at the center startingin the fall of 1945 were on the list: Theodor Benzinger, Siegfried Ruff, KonradSchäfer, Hermann Becker-Freyseng, and Oskar Schröder. Instead of firing thesephysicians suspected of heinous war crimes, the center kept the doctors in itsemploy and the list was classified. The list remained secret from the publicuntil 2012, when the Department of Defense (DoD) agreed to declassify it forthis book."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter012]TOTAL WAR OF APOCALYPTIC PROPORTIONS [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter012]By the end of January 1946 [endnotes.xhtml#en0662], 160 Nazi scientists had beensecreted into America. The single largest group was comprised of the 115 rocketspecialists at Fort Bliss, Texas, led by Wernher von Braun. The men resided in atwo-story barracks [endnotes.xhtml#en0663] on the Fort Bliss reservation andworked in a laboratory that was formerly the William Beaumont General Hospital.They ate in a mess hall shared with Native American Indians, which only enhancedvon Braun’s perception that he was living life inside an adventure novel. “It issuch a romantic Karl May affair [endnotes.xhtml#en0664],” von Braun wrote in aletter to his parents in Germany. Karl May was a German novelist famous for hiscowboy and Indian westerns. Soon, von Braun would begin writing a novel of hisown, in the science fiction genre, about space travel to Mars.Von Braun loved the desert landscape, the cactus, the vast gypsum dune fields,and the long drives in open army jeeps. Rocket work was not perfect, but itprogressed. “Frankly we were disappointed [endnotes.xhtml#en0665] with what wefound in this country during our first year or so,” von Braun later recalled.“At Peenemünde, we’d been coddled. Here they were counting pennies,” he said ofthe U.S. Army. V-2 launchings would take place about eighty miles away, on theWhite Sands Proving Ground, and getting there meant a long and beautiful ride.An army bus took scientists around the Franklin Mountains, through El Paso, andalong the Rio Grande to Las Cruces. Next came the rugged journey over the SanAndreas pass and into the Tularosa Basin, where the army’s proving groundsbegan. Twelve to fifteen Germans were sent at a time to White Sands, where theylived in barracks alongside men from the General Electric Company and atechnical army unit. The actual rocket firings [endnotes.xhtml#en0666] tookplace inside a single forty-foot-deep pit, with the Germans watching thelaunches from a massive but rudimentary concrete blockhouse nearby. When thefirst V-2 was launched, in April 1946, it climbed to three miles. Although oneof the fins fell off [endnotes.xhtml#en0667], von Braun felt inspired to draft amemo to Robert Oppenheimer, director of Los Alamos, proposing the idea ofmerging his missile with the atomic bomb. The memo turned into a proposal, “Useof Atomic Warheads in Projected Missiles,” submitted to the army. In it, vonBraun discussed building a rocket that could carry a two-thousand-plus-poundnuclear payload a distance of one thousand miles.Two personal changes in von Braun were afoot. The first was that he joined anEvangelical Christian church and became “born again,” something he rarelydiscussed in public. The second was that he decided to marry his first cousin[endnotes.xhtml#en0668], Maria von Quistorp, the daughter of his mother’sbrother, Alexander von Quistorp. Von Braun was nearly twice her age—she had justturned eighteen in the summer of 1946—and she lived in Germany. From Texas, vonBraun began making plans to bring his future bride to the United States.Descriptions of life out west in America varied from scientist to scientist.“The conditions of employment [endnotes.xhtml#en0669] were considered to be fairand generous by all,” said Dieter Huzel, the engineer who’d stashed the V-2documents in the Dörnten Mine. Arthur Rudolph liked the fact that the swimmingpool [endnotes.xhtml#en0670] and the bowling alley were made available to theGermans exclusively one afternoon a week. He told his biographer, who did notwant to be publicly identified and wrote using the pseudonym Thomas Franklin,that he missed his family and his Bible. Von Braun’s brother, Magnus, was beinginvestigated by the FBI for selling a platinum bar he had illegally smuggledinto the United States. Interrogators with the Department of Justice foundMagnus von Braun to be “snobby” and “conceited” and said that he seemed to pose“a worse threat to security than a half a dozen discredited SS Generals[endnotes.xhtml#en0671].”For Army Ordnance there were many problems to overcome. Funding was scarce.Shrinking military budgets offered very little room for missile developmentimmediately after the end of a world war. Also at Fort Bliss the army discoveredthat not all the so-called rocket scientists had the talents they allegedlypossessed. Karl Otto Fleischer, Major Staver’s original lead for the Dörntenmine and the man who led him on the wild goose chase around the Harz and to theInn of the Three Lime Trees, claimed to have been the Wehrmacht’s businessmanager, when in reality he had been in charge of food services. In Texas,Fleischer was assigned the job of club manager [endnotes.xhtml#en0672] until hewas finally “repatriated” to Germany. Von Braun had also sold the army on hiringWalter Weisemann, a Nazi public relations officer who had done some work in thePeenemünde valve shop. Von Braun called him an “eminent scientist.” In reality,Weisemann learned engineering in America working for the army.Fifteen hundred miles across the country, in the winter of 1946, there were nowthirty German scientists at Wright Field. Colonel Putt considered this sum to beoffensively low. At least once a month, he wrote to Army Air Forces headquartersin Washington requesting more German scientists and inquiring why theimportation of these “rare minds” was happening at a snail’s pace. In fact,there was very little for the Germans to do at Wright Field, and many of themwere restless. The Air Documents Research Center, formerly in London, had alsomoved to the Air Material Command headquarters, at Wright Field. There, fivehundred employees sorted, catalogued, indexed, and put on microfiche some 1,500tons of German documents captured by Alsos, CIOS, and T-Forces after the war. Soabundant was the material that more than one hundred thousand technical wordshad been added to the Air Material Command’s English-language dictionary. Theplethora of information provided some work opportunities [endnotes.xhtml#en0673]for a predominantly idle group of German specialists who in turn resented thiskind of work. The Germans perceived themselves as inventors and visionaries, notlibrarians or bureaucrats.One of the Germans, a Nazi businessman named Albert Patin, had been keepingtrack of the groups’ complaints [endnotes.xhtml#en0674], which now made theirway to Colonel Putt’s desk. It was not just the lack of challenging work, saidthe Germans; it was the whole package deal. The Hilltop was a dump. Paymentswere slow. The mail to Germany was even slower. Dayton had no civilized culture.The laboratory facilities at Wright Field were nothing compared to the grandlaboratories of the Third Reich. In general, the Germans told Putt, they werebeginning to “distrust” their American hosts “based on promises broken by USAofficers.”Colonel Putt’s next move was a controversial one. He appealed to Albert Patinfor help. At fifty-eight, Patin was one of the more senior Germans at theHilltop. He was a wartime armaments contractor whose numerous factories producedequipment for the Luftwaffe under the Speer ministry. When Patin’s facilitieswere first captured by the U.S. Army, one of the American technicalinvestigators, Captain H. Freiberger, was so amazed by Patin’s industrial vision[endnotes.xhtml#en0675] that he called “the soundness of his principles arevelation.” For Colonel Putt, Albert Patin’s wartime innovations representedthe best and the brightest of Reich science. Putt coveted the scientificinventions that Patin’s factories mass-produced, which included navigation aids,in-flight steering mechanisms, and automatic control devices. This kind oftechnology would give the Army Air Forces a ten-year jump on anything theRussians had, Putt believed.Hiring Patin for a U.S. Army Air Forces contract meant ignoring his past. Hisarmaments factories used slave labor, which was a war crime. In anautobiographical report for Putt, Albert Patin admitted that many of the peoplein his six-thousand-person workforce were slave laborers supplied by HeinrichHimmler’s SS. Patin stated that he was not ashamed of this; he explained toColonel Putt that he had been one of the better bosses in the Third Reich. Hedidn’t encircle his factories in electric fencing like other industrialists did.Patin acknowledged that his wartime access [endnotes.xhtml#en0676] to Hitler’sinner circle benefited his businesses, but he did not see how this made him awar profiteer. He was just following orders. Patin took summer holidays with theGöring family and winter trips with Albert Speer’s munitions procurement chief,Dieter Stahl, but so did a lot of people. He was no better and no worse.During this slow period at Wright Field, Colonel Putt had Albert Patin surveythe other Germans. He told Patin to be alert to grudges so that Patin couldformalize his list of complaints. Putt would in turn forward this summary to hissuperiors at Air Materiel Command. Patin’s job, Putt counseled, was to emphasizehow the Germans had become depressed, even suicidal, without their families andwithout the promise of long-term work. Colonel Putt sent Patin’s summary ofcomplaints to Air Force Headquarters in Washington, to the attention ofBrigadier General John A. Samford. In his own cover letter, Putt requested thatimmediate action be taken to “improve the morale [endnotes.xhtml#en0677] [of theGermans] and save the existing situation.”The name Albert Patin had already caught General Samford’s eye. All mail sent tothe scientists at Wright Field was screened by army intelligence first. AlbertPatin regularly received letters from his staff back in Germany, many of whomalso sought work in the United States. A letter had recently been sent to Patinin which lucrative offers from French and Russian intelligence agents werediscussed. Brigadier General Samford’s office [endnotes.xhtml#en0678] was madeaware of this unwelcome development. Coupled with the summary of Germanscientists’ dissatisfaction, General Samford took action. He sent the complaintlist as well as Patin’s intercepted mail to the War Department. “Immediateaction in this situation is imperative if we are to divert the services ofvaluable scientists from France and Russia to the United States,” GeneralSamford warned his colleagues.The timing created a perfect storm [endnotes.xhtml#en0679]. The JointIntelligence Committee was in the process of implementing a major policy change.It had just warned the Joint Chiefs that the existing idea of using restraintwhen dealing with the Soviets needed to be reconsidered. “Unless the migrationof important German scientists and technicians into the Soviet zone is stopped,”read a JIC memo to the Joint Chiefs, “we believe that the Soviet Union within arelatively short time may equal United States developments in the fields ofatomic research and guided missiles and may be ahead of U.S. developments inother fields of great military importance, including infra-red, television andjet propulsion.” The JIC also stated, incorrectly, that German nuclearphysicists were helping the Russians develop a nuclear bomb and that “theirassistance had already cut substantially, probably by several years, the timeneeded for the USSR to achieve practical results.” In reality the Soviets hadgotten to where they were in atomic bomb development not because of any Germanrare minds but by stealing information from American scientists at Los Alamos.Not until 1949 would the CIA learn that the Russian mole was a British scientistnamed Karl Fuchs, who worked on the Manhattan Project.In response to the perception that the Soviets were getting all the “importantGerman scientists,” the Joint Intelligence Committee proposed to the JIOA thatthree changes be implemented in the Nazi scientist program, effectiveimmediately. The first was to do everything possible in Germany to prevent morescientists from working for the Russians. The second was that the U.S. Army wasto make sure that German scientists and their families were given whatever itwas they were asking for, including American visas. Third, a list was drawn upproposing that as many as one thousand additional Germans be brought to Americafor weapons-related research.For Samuel Klaus, the second proposed policy change was untenable. The Naziscientist program was originally defined as “temporary,” with scientists workingunder military custody. That was how the War Department was able to circumventimmigration law for all the scientists already here. Now the JIOA was demandingthat immigration visas be issued to scientists and their families. Even if thepolicy change were approved, Klaus argued, the visa process was a slow-goingone. The State Department was legally required to approve each scientist’s visaapplication individually. This was not an overnight task but a lengthyinvestigative process. The person requesting a visa was required to list on hisor her application contacts who would in turn be interviewed by a representativefrom State. The Office of the Military Government in Germany needed to compile asecurity report on each individual scientist. Nazi Party records would have tobe pulled from the Berlin Document Center. If the scientist had won an honoraryaward from the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP)—the Nazi Party—orwas a member of the SS or the SA, that needed to be explained. This was the law,Klaus said.With the new information about the Soviets, Robert Patterson, now secretary ofwar, shifted [endnotes.xhtml#en0680] from being weary of the Nazi scientistprogram to becoming its champion. Only a year earlier, Patterson had called theGerman scientists “enemies… capable of sabotaging our war effort,” and hadwarned the Joint Chiefs of Staff that “[b]ringing them to this country raisesdelicate questions.” Now he stated in a memorandum that “the War Departmentshould do everything possible to clear away obstacles that may be raised in theState Department.” This in turn caused Secretary of State James F. Byrnes,Samuel Klaus’s boss, to soften his opposition to Operation Overcast. Due to theemerging Soviet threat, Secretary of State Byrnes and Secretary of War Pattersonagreed informally that leaving German scientists unsupervised inside Germany,where they could be bought by the Russians, was too dangerous. If the StateDepartment required individual investigations, so be it, Byrnes said. Germanscientists and their families should be allowed to enter the country undertemporary military custody with an interim State Department blessing, Pattersonwrote. The logic was simple. If we don’t get them, the Russians will.The State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee, now acting as an advisory body toJIOA, confirmed agreement with the positions of the Secretaries of War and Statebut added another consideration to the argument. German scientists left to theirown devices [endnotes.xhtml#en0681] presented “serious military implications tothe future of United States Security,” according to SWNCC. In other words,Samuel Klaus’s argument could now be used against him in the military’s attemptto speed up the visa application process. Yes, the German scientists wereinherently untrustworthy—so much so that they could not be trusted if they wereleft unsupervised, let alone left available to competing powers.On March 4, 1946, SWNCC Paper No. 275/5 went into effect. German scientistscould now be admitted to the United States in a classified program that was inthe “national interest.” [endnotes.xhtml#en0686] This shifted the focus fromwhether or not someone was a Nazi to whether they were someone the Russianswould be interested in. The commander in chief of U.S. Forces of Occupation inGermany and commander of U.S. Forces, European Theater (USFET), General JosephT. McNarney, was told to draft a list of one thousand top scientists in Germanywho were to be brought to the United States at once so the Russians couldn’t getthem. A military intelligence officer named Colonel R. D. Wentworth was assignedto provide General McNarney with material support on behalf of ArmyIntelligence, G-2. The scientists’ families were to be given food and clothingand were to be housed in a secret military facility northeast of Munich calledLandshut until their visa applications were approved. It was a radical revisionof the initial terms of the German scientist program, and it was exactly whatthe JIOA had envisioned all along.The following month, the members of JIOA were called together to spend an entireday hammering out new program protocols [endnotes.xhtml#en0682]. Expertconsultants like Alsos scientific director Samuel Goudsmit were invited toattend. Expedite the German scientist program, said the Joint Chiefs of Staff.There were now 175 German scientists in America under military custody, none ofwhom had visas. The consensus, save Klaus, was that the application processneeded to be sped up. The thorniest issue had to do with getting the StateDepartment to approve certain individuals who had clearly been Nazi ideologues,including members of the SS and SA. Also at issue were those men who receivedhigh awards for their important contributions to the Nazi Party. These werepeople that by regulation were entirely ineligible for citizenship.The meeting resulted in a clever workaround. Army Intelligence officersreviewing the OMGUS security reports of certain scientists could discreetlyattach a paperclip to the files of the more troublesome cases. Those files wouldnot be presented to the State Department right away. Instead, those men wouldremain under military custody in America, most likely for a longer period oftime than some of their fellows. As a result, the Nazi scientist program got anew code name. Operation Overcast had apparently been compromised after thefamilies of the German scientists starting calling their U.S. military housingCamp Overcast. So from now on, the Nazi scientist program would be calledOperation Paperclip [endnotes.xhtml#en0683].Not everyone understood the discreet paperclip-attached-to-the-file protocol.The first major setback came just a few months later, on July 17, 1946. GeneralJoseph McNarney wrote to JIOA [endnotes.xhtml#en0684] stating that he had workedwith Colonel Wentworth to identify 869 German scientists who were ready to signPaperclip contracts. But there was an obstacle. “There is a large number offormer Nazis and mandatory unemployables among those shown on the list,” GeneralMcNarney wrote. “These [men] cannot now [endnotes.xhtml#en0685] or later beemployed in the United States zone of Germany except in the labor category.”McNarney was following USFET rules that said all members of the SS and the SAhad to go through mandatory denazification trials.Citing America’s “national interest,” the JIOA would now change the language ofthe core principle guiding Paperclip’s original charter. “No known or allegedwar criminals” and “no active Nazis” would become no persons who might try and“plan for the resurgence of German military potential.” Assistant Secretary ofWar Howard Petersen felt this new language would allow the JIOA to “bypass thevisa people,” as stated in a memo dated July 24, 1946. But this was meant to betemporary. Eventually, State Department officials like Samuel Klaus would takeumbrage at this language. What JIOA really needed was an endorsement fromPresident Truman.By the summer of 1946 the relationship between the United States and the SovietUnion was shattering. The legendary Long Telegram [endnotes.xhtml#en0687],written by George F. Keenan, America’s diplomat in Moscow, had been received atthe State Department, reviewed by the president and his advisers, and sent toevery U.S. embassy around the world. After analyzing the Soviet’s “neurotic viewof world affairs,” Keenan warned his bosses at the State Department that “in thelong run there can be no permanent peaceful coexistence” with the Soviet Union.The two nations were destined to become steadfast enemies, Keenan said.Influenced by Keenan’s insights, President Truman asked White House counselClark Clifford to prepare a study of the current state of affairs and the futureprospects regarding Soviet-American relations [endnotes.xhtml#en0688] from amilitary standpoint. To do so Clifford culled reports and briefings from theSecretaries of War, State, and Navy as well as the attorney general, the JointChiefs of Staff, various directors of military and civilian intelligence, andGeorge Keenan. The result was an alarming Top Secret analysis. The report’sconclusion was made clear in the introduction: “Soviet leaders believe that aconflict is inevitable between the U.S.S.R. and the capitalist states, and theirduty is to prepare the Soviet Union for this conflict.” Clifford warned thatSoviet leaders were on a path “designed to lead to eventual world domination.”The Russians were developing atomic weapons, guided missiles, a strategic airforce, and biological and chemical weapons programs. The idea of “peacefulcoexistence of communist and capitalist nations is impossible,” Clifford wrote.The only way to counter this threat was to use the “language of military power.”Not military force, but military threat.On August 30, 1946, the undersecretary of the State Department, Dean Acheson,asked President Truman to make a decision on Paperclip. If the president did notact quickly, Acheson wrote, many of the German scientists “may be lost to us.”After four days of deliberation Truman gave his official approval of the programand agreed that Operation Paperclip should be expanded to include one thousandGerman scientists [endnotes.xhtml#en0689] and technicians and allow for theireventual immigration to the United States. With presidential approval official[endnotes.xhtml#en0690], the attorney general was able to expedite the proposedchanges to the program. A new JIOA contract was drawn up, allowing scientistswho had been in the United States for six months to sign on for another year,and with the government maintaining the right to renew the contract for anotherfive years. Operation Paperclip was transitioning from a temporary program to along-term one. Former enemies of the state would now be eligible for covetedU.S. citizenship.In response to the Clifford Report, the Joint Intelligence Committee conductedits own classified assessment of the Soviet threat, JCS 1696. The Soviet Union,wrote the JIC, sought world domination and would begin by bringing other nationsinto Soviet control to isolate the capitalist world. JIC saw a future war withthe Soviet Union as being of apocalyptic proportion. In a war “with the SovietUnion we must envisage complete and total hostilities unrestricted in any way onthe Soviet part by adherence to any international convention or humanitarianprincipals,” noted JCS 1696. “Preparations envisaged on our part and our plansmust be on this basis.” In other words, for the United States to prepare for“total war” with the Soviets, America had to maintain military supremacy in allareas of war fighting, including chemical warfare, biological warfare, atomicwarfare, and any other kind of warfare the other side dreamed up.Copies of the classified report were sent out to thirty-seven or thirty-eightpeople, says CIA historian Larry A. Valero, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff.It was not known if President Truman received a copy of JCS 1696, as he was noton the distribution list.One of the scientists on the JIOA list of one thousand was Dr. Kurt Blome. TheAllies were unsure what to do with Hitler’s biological weapons maker. Clearly,no discreet paperclip attached to Blome’s file would be able to whitewash thereality of his inner-circle role as deputy surgeon general of the Third Reich.But if the United States were to go to war with the Soviet Union it would mean“total war” and, according to JCS 1696, would likely include biological warfare.America needed to “envisage” such a scenario and to plan for it, with both swordand shield. Dr. Blome had spent months at the Dustbin interrogation facility,Castle Kransberg, but had recently been transferred to the U.S. Army MilitaryIntelligence Service Center at Darmstadt, located eighteen miles south ofFrankfurt. In the summer of 1946, Dr. Blome was employed there by the U.S. Army“in the capacity of a doctor [endnotes.xhtml#en0691].”Dr. Kurt Blome’s expertise was in great demand, but his future was as yetundecided. In his Posen laboratory, Blome had made considerable progress withlive plague pathogens, including bubonic and pneumonic plague. How far thatresearch progressed remained vague, likely because it would put an unwantedspotlight [endnotes.xhtml#en0692] on human experiments many believed had takenplace there. Blome repeatedly told investigators that he had intended to conducthuman trials but never actually did.Blome’s American counterpart in wartime plague-weapon research was aleft-leaning bacteriologist named Dr. Theodor Rosebury. During the war, thebiological weapons work Rosebury conducted was so highly classified that it wasconsidered as secret as atomic research. He had worked at a research facilityoutside Washington, D.C., called Camp Detrick. It was like Posen, only bigger[endnotes.xhtml#en0693]. Detrick had 2,273 personnel working on Top Secretbiological warfare programs. Like Blome, Rosebury worked on bubonic plague.Rosebury’s colleagues worked on 199 other germ bomb projects[endnotes.xhtml#en0694], including anthrax spore production, plant and animaldiseases, and insect research, in an effort to determine which bugs were themost effective carriers of certain diseases.Almost no one in America had any idea that the U.S. Army had been developingbiological weapons until January 3, 1946, when the War Department released aslim, sanitized government monograph called the Merck Report. That is when theAmerican public learned for the first time that the government’s Top Secretprogram [endnotes.xhtml#en0695] had been “cloaked in the deepest wartimesecrecy, matched only by the Manhattan Project for developing the Atomic Bomb.”The rationale behind developing these kinds of weapons, the public was told, wasthe same as it had been with America’s wartime chemical weapons program. If theNazis had used biological agents to kill Allied soldiers, the U.S. militarywould have been prepared to retaliate in kind. Yes, the war was over, Americanswere now told, but unfortunately there was a new and emerging threat out there,the Merck Report warned, an invisible and insidious evil capable of killingmillions on a vast, unknowable scale. America’s bioweapons program needed tocontinue, the Merck Report made clear. America may have won the war with themighty atomic bomb, but biological weapons were the poor man’s nuclear weapon.Biological weapons could be made by just about any country “without vastexpenditures of money or the construction of huge production facilities.” Abioweapon could be hidden “under the guise of legitimate medical orbacteriological research,” the report said.The Merck Report was written by George W. Merck, a forty-eight-year-old chemistand the owner of Merck & Co., a pharmaceutical manufacturer in New Jersey. Merckhad served Presidents Roosevelt and Truman as civilian head of the U.S.biological warfare effort during the war. Merck & Co. made and sold vaccines[endnotes.xhtml#en0696], notably the first commercial U.S. smallpox vaccine, in1898, and, in 1942, it manufactured penicillin G, among the first generalantibiotics. During World War II, U.S. soldiers received smallpox vaccines. Theman diagnosing the bioweapons threat, George Merck, was also the man whosecompany might sell the government the solution to combat the threat. In 1946this was not looked upon with the same kind of scrutiny as it might have beendecades later, because America’s military-industrial complex had yet to bebroadly revealed.The Merck Report did not specify what kind of germ warfare had been researchedand developed by the United States, only that it took place at a Top Secretfacility “in Maryland.” Camp Detrick was a 154-acre land parcel surrounded bycow fields about an hour’s drive north of Washington, and under the jurisdictionof the former Chemical Warfare Service, then the Chemical Corps. After therelease of the Merck Report, and coupled with the ominous “total war” prospectsas outlined in the Clifford Report and the JCS 1696, Congress would grant vastsums of money to the Chemical Corps for biological weapons research and Detrickwould expand exponentially.Dr. Kurt Blome had information that was coveted by the bacteriologists at CampDetrick, and plans were being drawn up to interview him. And then, in the summerof 1946, a totally unexpected event occurred inside the Palace of Justice inNuremberg that would render hiring Dr. Kurt Blome for Operation Paperclip animpossibility, at least for now. In the tenth month of the trial, the Sovietspresented a surprise witness, putting an unforeseen and unwelcomed focus on Dr.Kurt Blome. The witness was Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber—the shield toBlome’s sword.On August 12, 1946, prosecutors for the Soviet Union stunned the tribunal byannouncing that a missing Nazi general and the former surgeon general of theThird Reich, Major General Walter P. Schreiber, was going to testify against hiscolleagues at Nuremberg.Schreiber was brought forth as a witness to show that, after the Nazis’ crushingdefeat at Stalingrad, the Third Reich was planning to retaliate by conducting amajor biological warfare offensive against Soviet troops. This was the firsttime information about biological warfare was being presented at the trial. TheAllies were not informed that Schreiber was going to be a witness. U.S.prosecutors asked to interview him in advance of his testimony, but the Sovietsdenied the request. The medical war crimes investigator, Dr. Leopold Alexander,appealed to speak with Schreiber himself, to no avail.During the war, Schreiber held the position [endnotes.xhtml#en0698] of wartimechief of medical services, Supreme Command, Wehrmacht. He was the Third Reich’shighest-ranking major general who was also a physician, and he held the title[endnotes.xhtml#en0697] Commanding Officer of the Scientific Section of theMilitary Medical Academy in Berlin. Most important, he was the physician incharge of vaccines. Schreiber had been in Soviet custody for sixteen months,since April 30, 1945, when he was captured by the Red Army in Berlin. Accordingto Schreiber, he had opened a large military hospital in a subway tunnel aroundthe corner from the Führerbunker and had been tending to “several hundredwounded” soldiers when the Soviets captured him. After being taken by train tothe Soviet Union, he was moved around various interrogation facilities[endnotes.xhtml#en0699], he said, until he ended up in Lubyanka Prison, thenotorious penitentiary located inside KGB headquarters in Moscow. Nuremberg wasSchreiber’s first public appearance since war’s end. No one, including hisfamily members, had any idea where he had been.That the former surgeon general for the Third Reich was now going to helpRussian prosecutors send his former Nazi colleagues to the gallows for theircrimes was as ironic as it was outrageous. Dr. Schreiber was on the U.S. Army’sCentral Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects list. Along with many ofthose colleagues, and since war’s end, Major General Walter Schreiber had beensought by the Allied forces for possible war crimes. If the Americans hadlocated him and had a chance to interrogate him, he might well have been in thedock at Nuremberg facing the hangman’s noose alongside his colleagues. Instead,here he was, testifying against them.It was Monday morning, August 26, 1946, when Dr. Schreiber took the stand[endnotes.xhtml#en0700]: Day 211 of the trial. Colonel Y. V. Pokrovsky, deputychief prosecutor of the Soviet Union, presented Schreiber to the court as awitness. German defense lawyer Dr. Hans Laternser, counsel for the General Staffand Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres, or OKH), objected, on thegrounds that the evidence was submitted too late. “The Tribunal is not inclinedto admit any evidence so late as this, or to reopen questions which have beengone into fully before the Tribunal,” said the tribunal’s president, LordJustice Sir Geoffrey Lawrence, “but, on the other hand, in view of theimportance of the statement of Major General Schreiber and its particularrelevance, not only to the case of certain of the individual defendants butalso, to the case of the High Command, the Tribunal will allow Major GeneralSchreiber to be heard as a witness.” In other words, Schreiber was ahigh-ranking Nazi general and the judges wanted to hear what he had to say. Withthat, Schreiber was brought to the witness stand.He stood five foot six and weighed 156 pounds. A long-sleeve shirt covered thesaber scars on his right forearm. At fifty-three years old, Schreiber had beenan active military doctor since 1921. He was an expert in bacteriology andepidemiology and had traveled the globe studying infectious diseases, from aplague outbreak in West Africa to a malaria epidemic in Tunisia. He claimed tounderstand medical aspects of desert warfare and winter warfare better thananyone else in the Third Reich. He was also an expert in biological and chemicalweapons, in typhus and malaria epidemics, and in the causes and conditions ofjaundice and gangrene. When war came Schreiber, an affable and ambitious son ofa postal worker, was catapulted to the top of the Wehrmacht’s medical chain ofcommand [endnotes.xhtml#en0701]. This was in part due to the Reich’s zealouslygerm-phobic core. Schreiber’s vast knowledge of and experience withhygiene-related epidemics made his expertise highly valuable to the Nazi Party.He was put in charge of the research to fight infectious disease, and also inremedial means to defend against outbreaks. In this way, he became privy toReich medical policy from the top down. In 1942, Hermann Göring also put GeneralSchreiber in charge of protection against gas and bacteriological warfare, whichis how he came to be in charge of the Reich’s program to produce vaccines.“I swear by God the Almighty and Omniscient that I will speak the pure truth andwill withhold and add nothing,” Schreiber promised when taking the oath. MajorGeneral G. A. Alexandrov, the Russian assistant prosecutor, asked Schreiber whatevent had compelled him to testify at Nuremberg.“In the second World War things occurred on the German side which were againstthe unchangeable laws of medical ethics,” Schreiber said from the stand. “In theinterests of the German people, of medical science in Germany, and the trainingof the younger generation of physicians in the future, I consider it necessarythat these things should be thoroughly cleared up. The matters in question arethe preparations for bacteriological warfare, and they give rise to epidemicsand experiments on human beings.” Schreiber was saying that the Reich had beenpreparing for offensive biological warfare and had used the Untermenschen—thesubhumans—as guinea pigs.General Alexandrov asked General Schreiber why he had waited so long to comeforth—if he had been coerced into making statements or if he had taken theinitiative himself.“I myself took the initiative,” Schreiber declared. “When I heard the report ofDr. Kramer and Professor Holzlehner [Holzlöhner] here in Nuremberg I was deeplyshocked at the obviously perverted conceptions of some of the German doctors,”he said. Holzlöhner and Schreiber had been close friends and colleagues. AfterSchreiber learned about Holzlöhner’s murderous freezing experiments—at theNuremberg conference of 1942, “Medical Problems of Sea Distress and WinterDistress”—he invited Holzlöhner [endnotes.xhtml#en0702] to come give the samelecture at the Military Medical Academy in Berlin.But how had Dr. Schreiber heard these revelatory reports if he was in prison inthe Soviet Union? Alexandrov asked. This had to have been a question on manypeople’s minds.“In the prison camp German newspapers were available in the club room,”Schreiber claimed, making the notorious Lubyanka Prison sound like anaristocratic men’s club as opposed to the draconian penal institution that itwas. “I had to wait and see whether this Court itself might not raise thequestion of bacteriological warfare,” Schreiber said. “When I saw that it didnot raise this question I decided in April to make this statement.”“Witness,” said General Alexandrov, “will you kindly tell us what you know aboutthe preparations by the German High Command for bacteriological warfare?”“In July 1943, the High Command of the Wehrmacht called a secret conference, inwhich I took part as representative of the Army Medical Inspectorate,” saidSchreiber. “A bacteriological warfare group was formed at this meeting. As aresult of the war situation the High Command authorities now had to take adifferent view of the question of the use of bacteria as a weapon in warfarefrom the one held up till now by the Army Medical Inspectorate,” Schreibertestified. “Consequently, the Führer, Adolf Hitler, had charged Reich MarshalHermann Goering to direct the carrying out of all preparations forbacteriological warfare, and had given him the necessary powers,” Schreibersaid. In this statement, Schreiber was contradicting the generally acceptednotion that Hitler had never authorized his generals to use chemical orbiological weapons against Allied troops. In fact, no chemical or biologicalweapons were ever used in World War II, which made it strange that Schreiber hadbeen brought all the way to Nuremberg to testify to something that wasultimately irrelevant to the war crimes trial. Why, then, was Schreiber reallythere?“At [this] secret conference it was decided that an institute should be createdfor the production of bacterial cultures on a large scale,” Schreiber said, “andthe carrying out of scientific experiments to examine the possibilities of usingbacteria [in warfare]. The institute was also to be used for experimenting withpests which could be used against domestic animals and crops, and which were tobe made available if they were found practicable.”“And what was done after that?” Major General Alexandrov asked rather pointedly.“A few days later, I learned… that Reich Marshal Goering had appointed theDeputy Chief of the Reich Physicians’ League, [Dr. Kurt] Blome, to carry out thework, and had told him to found the institute as quickly as possible in or nearPosen.”“And what do you know about the experiments which were being carried out for thepurpose of bacteriological warfare?” General Alexandrov asked.“Experiments were carried out at the institute in Posen,” Schreiber saidominously, referring to Blome’s institute for plague research. “I do not knowany details about them. I only know that aircraft were used for spraying testswith bacteria emulsion, and that insects harmful to plants, such as beetles,were experimented with, but I cannot give any details. I did not makeexperiments myself.”Alexandrov asked if the army high command knew about these experiments;Schreiber replied, “I assume so.”“Will you kindly tell us precisely what the reason was for the decision of theOKW to prepare for bacteriological warfare?” Alexandrov asked.“The defeat at Stalingrad,” Schreiber said, “led to a reassessment of thesituation, and consequently to new decisions. It was no doubt considered whethernew weapons could be used which might still turn the tide of war in our favor.”“So why didn’t the Reich use biological weapons?” Alexandrov asked.Instead of answering the question, General Schreiber went into minute detailregarding a meeting in March 1945 with Dr. Blome. “In March 1945, ProfessorBlome visited me at my office at the Military Medical Academy,” Schreiberrecalled. “He had come from Posen and was very excited. He asked me whether Icould accommodate him and his men in the laboratories at Sachsenburg so thatthey could continue their work there; he had been forced out of his institute atPosen by the advance of the Red Army. He had had to flee from the institute andhe had not even been able to blow it up. He was very worried at the fact thatthe installations for experiments on human beings at this institute, the purposeof which was obvious, might be easily recognized by the Russians for what theywere. He had tried to have the institute destroyed by a Stuka bomb but that,too, was not possible. Therefore, he asked me to see to it that he be permittedto continue work at Sachsenburg on his plague cultures, which he had saved,”Schreiber said.Dr. Blome wasn’t on trial. Why was Schreiber spending so much of his testimonytalking about Dr. Blome? “During his visit Blome told me that he could continuehis work at an alternative laboratory in [Geraberg,] Thuringia,” Schreiber said,“but that this was not yet completed. It would take a few days or even a fewweeks to complete it, and that he had to have accommodation until then. He addedthat if the plague bacteria were to be used when the military operations were sonear to the borders of Germany, when units of the Red Army were already onGerman soil, it would, of course, be necessary to provide special protection forthe troops and the civilian population. A serum had to be produced. Here againtime had been lost, and as a result of all these delays it had never beenpossible to put the idea into effect.”Was Schreiber’s testimony focused against Dr. Kurt Blome out of some kind ofpersonal rivalry or vendetta? On the witness stand, Schreiber also fingered anumber of other Reich medical doctors, none of whom was on trial. In addition tonaming Kramer and Holzlöhner as organizers of the freezing experiments,Schreiber said that a man called Dr. Ding “had artificially infected [KZprisoners] with typhus using typhus-infected lice” and that the “talentedsurgeon” Dr. Karl Gebhardt had “carried out cranium operations on Russianprisoners of war and had killed the prisoners at certain intervals in order toobserve the pathological changes.” Schreiber testified that the “DefendantGoering had ordered these experiments,” and that the “Reichsführer-SS Himmlerhad kindly made available the subjects for the experiments.” But in adisproportionate amount of his testimony Schreiber circled back to Dr. Blome’splague research [endnotes.xhtml#en0703] for the Reich.Dr. Hans Laternser was given an opportunity to cross-examine the witness.Laternser asked Schreiber if his testimony for the Russian assistant prosecutorwas prepared. Schreiber said no.“Was any advantage promised to you for making this report?” Laternser asked.“No, nothing was promised me. I would refuse to allow anybody to hold outadvantages to me,” Schreiber said.“Well, let us assume that such a devilish idea as actually to use bacteria didexist. Would that not have involved your troops in serious danger?” Laternserasked.“Not only our troops, but the whole German people; for the refugees were movingfrom East to West. The plague would have spread very swiftly to Germany.”“I have one more question, Witness. Did you ever write down your objections tothis bacteriological warfare?” Dr. Laternser asked.Schreiber said, “Yes, in the memorandum which I mentioned before.”Dr. Laternser asked, “When did you submit that memorandum?”“In 1942; may I now—”“That is enough,” Laternser interrupted. He’d caught Schreiber in a lie. “Theconference took place in July 1943!”Laternser had no further questions. The tribunal adjourned. Perhaps embarrassedby the fact that their star witness had been caught in a lie, the Russians didnot call Schreiber back to the stand. Dr. Alexander made yet another attempt tointerview him, again without success. The Russians said they were sorry, but Dr.Schreiber had already been transported back to Moscow. It was a curious event,but something did result from Schreiber’s bizarre testimony. Two days later, amilitary vehicle pulled into the U.S. Army Military Intelligence Service Centerat Darmstadt, where Blome had been employed by the army [endnotes.xhtml#en0704]as a post doctor. Dr. Blome was arrested and taken to the prison complex[endnotes.xhtml#en0705] at the Nuremberg Palace of Justice. A “confidentialchange of status report” [endnotes.xhtml#en0706] now listed him as a prisoner inthe custody of the 6850 Internal Security Detachment, Nuremberg, where ColonelBurton Andrus served as prison commandant.Circumstance had altered Blome’s future. He was off the Paperclip list andinstead placed on a list of defendants who would face prosecution at theupcoming Nuremberg doctors’ trial.One hundred and fifty miles from Nuremberg, at the Army Air Forces classifiedresearch facility in Heidelberg, the massive undertaking forged ahead. For anentire year now, day in and day out, fifty-eight German physicians[endnotes.xhtml#en0707] in white lab coats had been working on an array ofresearch projects in state-of-the-art laboratories studying human endurance,night vision, blood dynamics, exposure to bomb blast, acoustic physiology, andmore. They all reported [endnotes.xhtml#en0708] to Dr. Strughold, who reportedto the facility’s commanding officer, Colonel Robert J. Benford. High-rankingmilitary officers regularly visited the facility [endnotes.xhtml#en0709],including its two founders, General Malcolm Grow and Colonel Harry Armstrong.Grow was working in Washington, D.C., as the air surgeon (soon to be the firstsurgeon general of the U.S. Air Force). Harry Armstrong had returned to Texaswhere he was now commandant at the School of Aviation Medicine (SAM) at RandolphField.Working alongside the Nazi doctors in Heidelberg were dozens of army translatorspreparing English-language versions of the physicians’ reports. By September1946 there were over a thousand pages of documents completed. Soon everythingwould be compiled into a two-volume monograph [endnotes.xhtml#en0710] for theArmy Air Forces entitled German Aviation Medicine, World War II.Work progressed well for Strughold’s staff of doctors in Heidelberg until theinstitute was thrown into psychological chaos. On September 17, 1946, militarysecurity officers with the Counter Intelligence Corps, 303 Detachment, arrivedat the center with five arrest warrants [endnotes.xhtml#en0711] in hand. DoctorsTheodor Benzinger, Siegfried Ruff, Konrad Schäfer, Hermann Becker-Freyseng, andOskar Schröder were wanted by the International Military Tribunal, Nuremberg,for “War Crimes as suspect.” The men were arrested and taken to the prisoncomplex at the Nuremberg Palace of Justice, to the same wing where Dr. Blome wasalready incarcerated. If any of this were to come to light—that the U.S. ArmyAir Forces had been employing war crimes suspects and had them conductingmilitary research at a facility inside Germany, expressly prohibited by Alliedpeace agreements—Harry Armstrong’s institute would be shut down, OperationPaperclip would be exposed, and the U.S. Army would have an internationalscandal on its hands.The Nazi doctors’ trial was the first of the so-called subsequent trials to takeplace after the trial of the major war criminals at Nuremberg. It began onDecember 9, 1946. Unlike with the first trial, the twenty-three defendants[endnotes.xhtml#en0712] at the doctors’ trial—twenty doctors and three SSbureaucrats—were virtually unknown figures in the eyes of the American public.What was known, from earlier press coverage, was that these proceedings wouldput lurid Nazi science on trial. In the words of chief prosecutor GeneralTelford Taylor, Nazi doctors had become proficient in the “macabre science” ofkilling. Torturous medical experiments conducted on concentration camp prisonersincluded freezing experiments, high-altitude tests, mustard gas research,seawater drinkability tests, malaria research, mass sterilization, andeuthanasia. The New York Times called the doctors’ crimes “beyond the pale[endnotes.xhtml#en0713] of even the most perverted medicine” and cautioned thatsome details were difficult to report because they were impossible tocomprehend. The New York Times cited one particularly grotesque example.Perfectly healthy people, “Jews and Slavs,” had been murdered at the request ofSS physician Dr. August Hirt for a university skeleton collection of theUntermenschen. [endnotes.xhtml#en0714] This was the same anatomist named by Dr.Eugen Haagen in papers discovered by Alsos officers in Strasbourg in November1944. Hirt, an expert in dinosaur anatomy, had committed suicide before thetrial. The defendants ran the gamut from “the dregs of [endnotes.xhtml#en0715]the German medical profession” to doctors who had once been internationallyesteemed [endnotes.xhtml#en0716], like Dr. Kurt Blome.On October 12, 1946, the Stars and Stripes newspaper, which operated from insidethe Pentagon, listed the individual names [endnotes.xhtml#en0717] of the doctorscharged—a list that included the five Luftwaffe doctors who had been arrested atthe U.S. Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center: Theodor Benzinger, Siegfried Ruff,Konrad Schäfer, Hermann Becker-Freyseng, and Oskar Schröder. In a matter ofweeks, these physicians had gone from being employed by the U.S. Army to beingtried by the U.S. military for war crimes. The ultimate judicial punishment wason the line: Each doctor faced a possible death sentence.The following week, inside the prison complex at the Nuremberg Palace ofJustice, there was a strange occurrence involving Dr. Benzinger. In Benzinger’spretrial investigation he admitted being aware of the fact that medicalexperiments were taking place at concentration camps and that nonconsenting testsubjects had been murdered in the process. Benzinger also admitted that he hadattended the October 1942 conference [endnotes.xhtml#en0718] in Nuremberg,“Medical Problems of Sea Distress and Winter Distress,” where data from murderedpeople was openly discussed among ninety Luftwaffe doctors. During Benzinger’sNuremberg incarceration, prosecutors revealed to him that they had a new detailregarding his accessory to medical crimes, namely, the “motion picture of therecord of the [medical murder] experiments” that had been shown at a privatescreening at the Air Ministry. Benzinger did not deny that he had been one of aselect group of doctors invited by Himmler to attend this film screening[endnotes.xhtml#en0719]; nor did he deny that he was one of nine persons chosenby Himmler to host the event. Benzinger was part of an elite inner circle ofLuftwaffe doctors favored by the Reichsführer-SS, he conceded, but that was nota crime [endnotes.xhtml#en0720]. But prosecutors also had a document thatsuggested Benzinger was far more implicated in the crimes than he let on. “Afterthe showing of the film [endnotes.xhtml#en0721], most of the spectators withdrewand a small group of doctors remained behind [including] Benzinger. They askedRascher… for a verbal report on the experiments,” the document read. Benzingerinsisted [endnotes.xhtml#en0722] that all he did was listen. That there was noevidence of his having participated in any of the medical murders and that therewere no documents and no eyewitnesses that could prove otherwise.On October 12, 1946, Dr. Theodor Benzinger was announced as a defendant in theforthcoming doctors’ trial. And then, just eleven days later, on October 23,1946, Benzinger was released from the Nuremberg prison without furtherexplanation. He was returned directly to the custody of the Army Air Forces, asstated in his declassified Nuremberg prisoner file. After spending a little overa month in the Nuremberg jail [endnotes.xhtml#en0723], Benzinger was back inHeidelberg continuing his U.S. Army research work. There was no explanation asto why Benzinger was dropped from the list of defendants in the upcomingdoctors’ trial. It would take decades for an important clue to be revealed, byNuremberg trial expert and medical history professor Paul Weindling. As itturned out, in the fall of 1946, Benzinger had recently completed a paper onpilot physiology concerning stratospheric, or extremely high-altitude, aircraft.“The US [Army] Air Forces, Wright Field circulated his report[endnotes.xhtml#en0724] on this topic in October 1946—just weeks after hisdetention and release” from the prison complex at the Nuremberg Palace ofJustice, Weindling explains. The suggestion is that perhaps someone in the ArmyAir Forces felt Benzinger’s expertise was more in the “national interest” thanwas trying him for war crimes. One of the Nuremberg prosecutors, a Bostonattorney named Alexander G. Hardy, was outraged when he learned of Benzinger’srelease and insisted that the “interrogations were sloppy[endnotes.xhtml#en0725].”Back at the AAF Aero Medical Center in Heidelberg, the arrests of the fivedoctors on war crimes charges had everyone on edge. The classified programstaking place there began to quietly wind down. While Doctors Ruff, Schäfer,Hermann Becker-Freyseng, and Schröder faced judgment at Nuremberg, thirty-fourof the doctors remaining [endnotes.xhtml#en0726] at the center prepared forshipment to the United States under Operation Paperclip. One of the firstdoctors in the group to head to America for work, in February 1947, was Dr.Theodor Benzinger.At Nuremberg, while the doctors from Heidelberg remained incarcerated in onewing of the prison awaiting trial, preparations of another kind were also goingon. The trial of the major war criminals was over. On the morning of October 1,the judges took turns reading the verdicts: nineteen convictions and threeacquittals of the twenty-two accused major war criminals (one, Bormann, inabsentia). That same afternoon, the tribunal pronounced what sentences would beimposed [endnotes.xhtml#en0727]: twelve death sentences, three life sentences,and four lengthy prison terms. Albert Speer, the only defendant who pled guilty,was sentenced to twenty years.The doctors from Heidelberg were housed in a separate wing of the prison wherepretrial interviews would continue for another two months. Also in custodyinside the prison complex at the Palace of Justice was Dr. Otto Ambros. Ambroswould be tried in a subsequent trial, Case VI or the Farben trial, which wasscheduled to begin in the summer of 1947.As commandant of the facility, Colonel Burton Andrus was in charge of allprisoners, including those who were soon to be hanged. The condemned had roughlytwo weeks to live. Andrus described the surreal atmosphere of the last days atNuremberg for the Nazis who had been sentenced to death. Ribbentrop,Kaltenbrunner, Frank, and Seyss-Inquart took communion and made a lastconfession to Father O’Conner, the Nuremberg priest. Göring bequeathed hisshaving brush and razor to the prison barber. Streicher penned six letters.Ribbentrop read a book. Keitel requested that a German folk song be played onthe organ as he was hanged. “On the night of 14th October, I made arrangementsfor the tightest security to be put around the prison,” Colonel Andrus recalled.“I wanted the condemned men [endnotes.xhtml#en0728] to know only at the verylast minute that their time had come to be hanged.”The Nuremberg gymnasium was chosen as the location where the executions wouldtake place. Each night, the U.S. Army prison guards played basketball there toblow off steam. The night before the gallows were constructed Andrus allowed theusual game to go on. “Late at night,” remembered Andrus, “when the sweatingplayers had trotted off to their showers, the grim-faced execution team passedthrough a door specially cut into the catwalk wall, and began their tasks in thegymnasium. A doorway had been cut into the blind side of the building so that noprisoner would see scaffolding being carried in.” The condemned prisoners werealso shielded from seeing the stretchers that would soon carry their corpsesaway.While the gallows were being built, drama unfolded in the prison. Göring hadrequested death by firing squad instead of hanging—to be hanged was something heconsidered beneath him. His plea was considered by the Allied Control Commissionand rejected. The night before he was to be hanged, Göring swallowed abrass-and-glass vial of potassium cyanide that he had skillfully managed to keephidden for eighteen months. In a suicide note, he explained how he had managedto keep the vial hidden from guards by alternating its hiding place[endnotes.xhtml#en0729], from his anus to his flabby navel. War crimesinvestigator Dr. Leopold Alexander would later learn that it was Dr. Rascher ofthe notorious Dachau experiments who had originally prepared Göring’s suicidevial for him.Shortly after midnight in the early morning hours of October 16, 1946, threesets of gallows had been built and painted black. Each had thirteen stairsleading up to a platform and crossbeam from which a noose with thirteen coilshung. The executioner was Master Sergeant John C. Woods, a man whose credentialsincluded hanging 347 U.S. soldiers over a period of fifteen years for capitolcrimes including desertion. At 1:00 a.m. Colonel Andrus read the names of thecondemned out loud. After each name, a bilingual assistant said, “Tod durch denStrang,” or death by the rope.One by one the Nazis were hanged. At 4:00 a.m. the bodies were loaded onto twotrucks and driven to a secret location just outside Munich. Here, at what waslater revealed to be the Dachau concentration camp, the bodies of theseperpetrators of World War II and the Holocaust were cremated in the camp’sovens. Their ashes were raked out, scooped up, and thrown into a river[endnotes.xhtml#en0730].When asked by Time magazine to comment on the hangings, executioner John C.Woods had this to say: “I hanged those ten Nazis [endnotes.xhtml#en0731]… and Iam proud of it… I wasn’t nervous.… A fellow can’t afford to have nerves in thisbusiness.… The way I look at this hanging job, somebody has to do it.”So it went, just one year and a few months after the end of World War II.Some Nazis were hanged. Others now had lucrative new jobs. Many, like the fourGerman doctors from the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center at Heidelberg, nowawaiting trial at Nuremberg, were in the gray area in between. Was the oldGerman proverb true? Jedem das Seine. Does everyone get what he deserves?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEEN [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter013]SCIENCE AT ANY PRICE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter013]The same week that the major war criminals convicted at Nuremberg were hangedand their ashes thrown into a river, Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson calledSamuel Klaus into his office at the State Department to discuss OperationPaperclip. At issue was the fact that JIOA had circulated a new Top Secretdirective, JIOA 257/22. The way in which Paperclip participants’ would nowreceive visas had officially been changed. Instead of allowing State Departmentrepresentatives to conduct preexaminations in Europe prior to visa issuance, aswas required by law, that process would be completed here in America by thecommissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). “TheDepartment of State would accept as final [endnotes.xhtml#en0732], theinvestigation and security reports prepared by JIOA, for insuring finalclearance of individuals concerned,” wrote JIOA director Colonel Thomas Ford.Acheson and Klaus were both aware that JIOA had wrested control of how visaswere issued and had done so in defiance of U.S. law. But the president hadsigned off on the directive. Operation Paperclip was now officially a “denialprogram,” meaning that any German scientist of potential interest to theRussians needed to be denied to the Russians, at whatever cost.There were now 233 Paperclip scientists in the United States in militarycustody. The State Department was told to expect to receive, in the comingmonths, their visa applications and those of their family members. Theinformation contained within the scientists’ OMGUS security dossiers promised tobe the “best information available.” Samuel Klaus knew this vague new languagemeant military intelligence officers could withhold damaging information aboutcertain scientists from State Department officials. The pipeline to bring ardentNazis and their families into the United States was open wide.Three weeks later the New York Times reported for the first time that there wereNazi scientists living in America under a secret military program. Its sourceswere the Russian army’s Berlin-based newspaper [endnotes.xhtml#en0733], TäglicheRundschau, and the Russian-licensed East German newspaper Berliner Zeitung. In afollow-up article, an anonymous source told the newspaper that “one thousandadditional German scientists” were on the way. “All were described as volunteersand under contract,” the article reported. “Their trial periods are generallysix months, after which they can apply for citizenship [endnotes.xhtml#en0734]and have their dependents brought to the United States.” Newsweek magazinerevealed that the secret military program’s classified name was ProjectPaperclip.Rather than deny the story, the War Department decided to go public with asanitized version of its program [endnotes.xhtml#en0735]. They would also makeseveral scientists at Wright Field “available to press, radio and pictorialservices.” An open house was organized with army censors releasing details andphotographs that would foster the appearance that all of the German scientistsin the United States were benign. At Wright Field the “dirigible expert” TheodorKnacke gave a demonstration with a parachute. The eighty-year-old Hugo Eckener,former chairman of the Zeppelin Company, explained to reporters that thanks tohis army contract he was now working with Goodyear on a new blimp design.Alexander Lippisch, inventor of the Messerschmitt Me 163 jet fighter, wasphotographed in a suit holding up a scale model of a sleek, futuristic,delta-wing jet, his hawkline nose staring down the end of the airplane. Theemphasis on Lippisch was not that his jet fighter held records for Alliedshoot-downs in the war but that his aircraft set international records forspeed. Ernst Eckert, an expert in jet fuels, discussed high-speed gas turbinesin his thick German accent. It was by mistake that the War Department allowedEckert to chat with reporters, considering that his JIOA file listed him as aNazi ideologue and former member of the SS and the SA. The program was becomingunwieldy, and no matter how hard the JIOA tried to maintain control, they couldnot keep an eye on all things. One American officer, assigned as a spokesman forthe Germans, told reporters he so enjoyed working with German scientists, “Iwish we had more of them [endnotes.xhtml#en0736].”Other German scientists at Wright Field were kept away from reporters,particularly those men who had been members of Nazi Party paramilitary squadslike the SA and the SS. In aerodynamicist Rudolf Hermann’s intelligence file, itwas written that during the war, while working inside the wind tunnels inKochel, Bavaria, Hermann had held morning roll calls in his brown SA uniform,and that he often gave speeches in support of Hitler. The information inengineer Emil Salmon’s OMGUS security report was even more incriminating. At theaircraft factory where he had worked, Salmon had been known to carry a rifle andwear an SS uniform. “He also belonged to the Storm Troops [sic] (SA) from1933–1945 and held the position of Troop Leader (Truppfuehrer),” read one memo.When bringing him to America, the army stated, “This Command is cognizant[endnotes.xhtml#en0737] of Mr. Salmon’s Nazi activities and certain allegationsmade by some of his associates in Europe,” namely, that during the war EmilSalmon had been involved in burning down a synagogue in his hometown ofLudwigshafen. But Emil Salmon was now at Wright Field because the Army AirForces found his knowledge and expertise “difficult, if not impossible, toduplicate.” Emil Salmon built aircraft engine test stands.For various press events, the army provided photographs [endnotes.xhtml#en0738]of some of the more wholesome-looking German scientists—definitely no one with adueling scar. There were pictures of white-haired men playing chess,window-shopping outside a Dayton, Ohio, toy store, smoking cigarettes, andsunning themselves on army grounds. To be invited to the open house, a reporterhad to agree in advance to clear his or her story with army censors before goingto press. The military placed its own article in the Stars and Stripespurporting to tell the official story: None of the Germans had ever been Nazis;the men were under strict supervision here in the United States; they were alloutstanding scientists and technicians “vital to national security”; they weremoral family men.The news stories about the scientists [endnotes.xhtml#en0739] at Wright Fieldgenerated a flurry of response, including newspaper editorials and letters tocongressmen. A Gallup Poll the following week revealed that most Americansbelieved that bringing one thousand more German scientists to America was a “badidea.” Journalist and foreign affairs correspondent Joachim Joesten was outragedby the very idea of Paperclip, writing in the Nation, “If you enjoy mass murder,but also treasure your skin, be a scientist, son. It’s the only way, nowadays,of getting away with murder.” Rabbi Steven S. Wise, president of the AmericanJewish Congress, penned a scathing letter to Secretary of War Patterson that wasmade public. “As long as we reward former servants of Hitler, while leaving hisvictims in D. P. [displaced-persons] camps, we cannot even pretend that we aremaking any real effort to achieve the aims we fought for.” Eleanor Rooseveltbecame personally involved in protesting Operation Paperclip, organizing aconference at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel with Albert Einstein as honored guest.The former First Lady urged the United States government to suspend visas forall Germans for twelve years. When professors at Syracuse University learnedthat a new colleague, Dr. Heinz Fischer, an expert in infrared technology and aformer member of the Nazi Party, had been sent by the army to work in one oftheir university laboratories under a secret military contract, they wrote aneditorial for the New York Times. “We object not because they are citizens[endnotes.xhtml#en0740] of an enemy nation, but because they were and probablystill are Nazis.”The Society for the Prevention of World War III—a group of several thousandwriters, artists, scholars, and journalists—did not mince words in theirDecember journal. The group had been set up during the war to advocate for harshpunitive measures against a nation they perceived as inherently aggressive andmilitaristic, and against individuals they believed had substantially profitedfrom the Nazi regime. “These German ‘experts’ performed wonders for the Germanwar effort. Can one forget their gas chambers, their skill in cremation, theirmeticulous methods used to extract gold from the teeth of their victims, theirwizardry in looting and thieving?” The society, which counted William L. Shirerand Darryl Zanuck among its members, urged all fellow Americans to contact theWar Department and demand that Hitler’s scientists be sent home.One engineer at Wright Field actually was about to be sent home. But tunnelengineer Georg Rickhey’s downfall came not because of the demands made by thepublic but because of the actions by a fellow German.In the fall of 1946, of the 233 Nazi scientists in America, 140 were at WrightField. With that many single men living together in isolation, the Hilltopbecame divided into social cliques. The Nazi businessman Albert Patin continuedto serve as Colonel Putt’s ears and eyes among the Germans, reporting to Puttabout the Germans’ needs and complaints. In this arrangement Patin wielded powerat the Hilltop. With the arrival of former Mittelwerk general manager GeorgRickhey, in the summer of 1946, Albert Patin saw a business opportunity. Rickheywas a former employee of the Speer ministry. He served as the general manager ofthe Mittelwerk slave labor facility in Nordhausen where the V-2 rockets werebuilt. Colonel Beasley of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey hadevacuated Rickhey to London, and after that work was completed, Rickhey washired to work at Wright Field. When asked by military intelligence officers whathis job was, Rickhey said, “Giving my knowledge and experience in regard toplanning, construction and operating underground factories.”Georg Rickhey was a tunnel engineer, and his value to the U.S. military was theknowledge he had gained while overseeing vast underground building projects forthe Reich. A memo in Rickhey’s dossier, written by the army’s Office of theDeputy Director of Intelligence, kept his most powerful negotiating secret asecret: “He was in charge of all tunnel operations directly under Hitler’sheadquarters in Berlin.” Georg Rickhey had overseen the building of theFührerbunker, where Hitler lived the last three months and two weeks of hislife. With its more than thirty rooms [endnotes.xhtml#en0741], cryptlikecorridors, multiple emergency exits, and hundreds of stairs, all located morethan thirty feet under Berlin, the Führerbunker was considered an engineeringtour de force. The army was impressed by how well Hitler’s Führerbunker hadwithstood years of heavy Allied bombing and was interested in learning fromGeorg Rickhey how to build similar underground command centers of its own.As the Cold War progressed, the U.S. Army would begin the secret construction ofsuch facilities, notably ones that could continue to function in the aftermathof a chemical, biological, or nuclear attack. It would take decades forjournalists to reveal that, starting in the early 1950s, several sprawling,multifloor, underground command centers had been secretly built for thispurpose, including one in the Catoctin Mountains, called Raven Rock MountainComplex, or Site R [endnotes.xhtml#en0742], and another in the Blue RidgeMountains, called Mount Weather.Georg Rickhey’s expertise in underground engineering was not limited to theconstruction of the Führerbunker. During the war, he had also served as adirector of the Reich’s Demag motorcar company [endnotes.xhtml#en0743], where heoversaw the construction [endnotes.xhtml#en0744] of a massive undergroundfacility where tanks had been assembled. And as general manager of theMittelwerk, he oversaw the construction of the rocket assembly facility nearNordhausen. In his army intelligence dossier, it was noted that Rickhey hadoverseen the underground construction of more than 1,500,000 square feet ofspace. At Wright Field, Rickhey was meant to start consulting with Americanengineers on underground engineering projects for the army. But that work wasslow and Rickhey was given a second job. Despite poor English skills, Rickheywas put in charge of examining V-2 documents captured at Nordhausen and, in hiswords, the “rendering of opinions on reports.”In the late summer of 1946 Albert Patin and Georg Rickhey started running ablack market operation at the Hilltop, selling booze and cigarettes to theircolleagues at premium prices. Rickhey had years of experience in wartime blackmarket operations. Military intelligence would later learn that during the war,what little rations the slave laborers were allotted by the Speer ministry,Rickhey would sometimes sell off at a price. At Wright Field, Rickhey andPatin’s black market business [endnotes.xhtml#en0745] quickly expanded, and themen enlisted outside assistance from Rickhey’s sister, Adelheid Rickhey, who wasliving in a hotel in New Jersey at the time. Adelheid Rickhey agreed to move toOhio to help the men expand their black market business into Dayton and beyond.Because the Germans’ mail was monitored, it did not take long for the higher-upsat Wright Field to learn what was going on, but the Army Air Forces took noaction against either man. The business continued into the fall of 1946, when itcame to a head.In their private time Rickhey and Patin liked to gamble [endnotes.xhtml#en0746].They also liked to drink. The two men regularly hosted parties at the Hilltop,staying up late drinking and playing cards. One night, in the fall of 1946, asixty-three-year-old German aircraft engineer named Hermann Nehlsen decided hehad had enough [endnotes.xhtml#en0747]. It was a little after midnight duringthe second week of October when Rickhey, Albert Patin, and a third man wereplaying cards. The noise woke up Hermann Nehlsen, who knocked on the door andtold the three cardplayers to quiet down. After Nehlsen’s second request wasignored, he opened the door, walked into the room, and turned off the lamp onthe card table. Rickhey, by Nehlsen’s account, was drunk. As Nehlsen wasleaving, Rickhey lit a candle and laughed at his German colleague. A man “couldstill play cards with a good kosher candle,” Rickhey joked.The incident was a tipping point for Hermann Nehlsen, and he went to ColonelPutt to file a formal complaint against the two men. There was more to thestory, Nehlsen told Colonel Putt. Rickhey was a war criminal. He had been theprimary person behind a mass hanging at Nordhausen, the hanging by crane of adozen prisoners, and had bragged about it on the ship ride coming over to theUnited States. As for Albert Patin, Hermann Nehlsen told Colonel Putt he was anardent Nazi as well, a member of the SA. Patin’s companies used slave laborersfrom concentration camps. What Hermann Nehlsen did not know was that ColonelPutt was not interested in the past histories of the German scientists in theArmy Air Forces’ employ. Or that Putt had a gentleman’s agreement[endnotes.xhtml#en0748] with Albert Patin and had been using him to keep an eyeon the other Germans at the Hilltop. Colonel Putt said he would look into theallegations. Instead, Putt had Nehlsen watched for future security violations.Hermann Nehlsen remained angry about the incident and wrote so in a letter to afriend in New York City named Erwin Loewy. Perhaps Nehlsen knew that all of hismail was read by military screeners, or maybe he did not. Either way, whatNehlsen wrote to Loewy caught the eye of Wright Field mail censors[endnotes.xhtml#en0749]. Nehlsen’s letter was turned over to the intelligencedivision to be analyzed. Several weeks later, Hermann Nehlsen violated securityand left Wright Field for a weekend visit with a relative in Michigan. ColonelPutt reported the violation to Air Material Command headquarters and arranged tohave Nehlsen transferred to Mitchel Field, an air force base in New York.But Hermann Nehlsen’s letter to Erwin Loewy about Georg Rickhey had a life ofits own. It made its way to Army Air Forces Headquarters, in Washington, D.C.,where it was read by Colonel Millard Lewis, Executive Assistant Chief of AirStaff-2. The allegations were serious, Colonel Lewis decided. They involvedalleged war crimes. Lewis sent a memorandum to the director of intelligence forthe War Department General Staff summarizing the situation and advising that aninvestigating officer be assigned to look into the matter. “Mr. Nehlsen statedthat Dr. Georg Rickhey, age 47, specialist in the field of engineering andproduction of guided missiles, was employed in the underground plant atNordhausen as a strong Nazi Party member, where in 1944, twelve foreign workerswere strung up on a cross beam and raised by a crane in the presence of thegroup of workers,” and killed, read Colonel Lewis’s memorandum. “One of thegroup who acted [endnotes.xhtml#en0750] as an observer asserted that Dr. Rickheywas the chief instigator for the execution.” The Pentagon assigned[endnotes.xhtml#en0751] an Air Corps Major named Eugene Smith to look into theGeorg Rickhey case.Back at Wright Field, Colonel Putt likely believed that the allegations againstRickhey had fallen by the wayside. Meanwhile, Hermann Nehlsen had been banishedto Mitchel Field. In January 1947 Putt recommended that Rickhey be given along-term military contract for employment at Wright Field. That request wasauthorized, and on April 12, 1947, Georg Rickhey signed a new, five-yearcontract [endnotes.xhtml#en0752] with the War Department. Separately, andwithout Putt’s knowledge, the Rickhey investigation was moving forward. At ArmyAir Forces Headquarters in Washington, Major Eugene Smith made preparations totravel to various military bases for interviews. It was Smith’s job to talk toRickhey’s former colleagues from Nordhausen, to write up his findings[endnotes.xhtml#en0757], and to file a report. Colonel Putt did not learn aboutthis investigation until Major Smith arrived at Wright Field. Putt suggested[endnotes.xhtml#en0753] Major Smith discuss Rickhey’s case with Captain AlbertAbels, the officer in charge of the Paperclip scientists at the Hilltop, so thatAbels could clear things up. Abels told Major Smith that the stories were “pettyjealousy” between scientists. Just gossip among men. Major Smith wasunconvinced. He headed to Mitchel Field to interview Hermann Nehlsen and otherGerman scientists who might have knowledge regarding the Rickhey case.Hermann Nehlsen stood by his original story. “In 1944, twelve foreign workerswere simultaneously hanged by being strung up on a cross beam and raised by acrane in the presence of the workers,” Nehlsen swore [endnotes.xhtml#en0754] inan affidavit. “Dr. Rickhey was the chief instigator for the execution,” meaningit was Rickhey’s idea to hang the men. A second witness emerged at MitchelField, a former engineer on the Nordhausen rocket assembly lines named WernerVoss. Voss also testified [endnotes.xhtml#en0755] that Rickhey was involved inthe hangings, and he provided important new details that added context to theexecutions. Shortly before the hangings, Voss said, British airplanes haddropped leaflets urging the Nordhausen slave laborers to revolt. A group of themdid revolt, and those men were among the ones hanged. The execution was a publicevent, Voss said, meant to intimidate other slave workers into subservience.These were serious allegations of war crimes. Major Smith needed corroboration,and for that, he headed to Fort Bliss, Texas. Smith had been told by the armythat he would be able interview Wernher von Braun as well as some of the othermen who had worked closely with Georg Rickhey inside the Nordhausen tunnels.At Fort Bliss, in the evenings [endnotes.xhtml#en0756], the German rocketspecialists gathered in a clubhouse built in a grove of cottonwood trees. There,they played cards while drinking American cocktails and beer. They strunghammocks between the trees and enjoyed balmy desert nights. Once a month, mostof the Germans went into El Paso as a group to shop and have a restaurant meal.The nightmarish environment at Nordhausen, which the majority of the rocketengineers had participated in, must have seemed like another world—until MajorSmith arrived to take official depositions for the U.S. Army and ask the men torecollect what those days had been like.Major Smith’s first interviews would be with Wernher von Braun and his brotherMagnus von Braun. But after Major Smith arrived at Fort Bliss, he was told thatboth von Braun brothers were out of town. Smith interviewed Günther Haukohlinstead. Haukohl had been the original designer of the Nordhausen rocketassembly line and, like Wernher von Braun, was an officer with the SS. GüntherHaukohl told Major Smith that he had no clear memories about what happened inthe tunnels in the last months of the war, but, yes, prisoners were abused.Rickhey’s involvement is “probably a rumor,” Haukohl said. V-2 engineers HansPalaoro and Rudolph Schlidt seconded Haukohl’s position, repeating the idea thatthe end of the war was nothing but a blur. Engineer Erich Ball, who also workedon the rocket assembly lines at Nordhausen, told Major Smith that he hadwitnessed two sets of prisoner hangings in the tunnels but that Georg Rickheyhad not been involved in either of them. Major Smith accepted that the men mightnot be able to remember details about what had gone on, but surely as engineersthey could remember the layout of the facility. Smith asked Haukohl, Schlidt,Palaoro, and Ball to use their engineers’ precision and help him create anaccurate illustration of the work spaces inside the Nordhausen tunnels,including where the rockets were assembled and where the hangings occurred. Thiswas an important artifact for the investigation.Next, Major Smith interviewed the former Mittelwerk operations director ArthurRudolph. Like Georg Rickhey, Arthur Rudolph had authority over the Mittelwerk’sPrison Labor Supply office, which was the unit responsible for getting foodrations to the slave laborers. In his interview, Arthur Rudolph first deniedever seeing prisoners abused. Major Smith showed Arthur Rudolph the illustrationthat had been drawn by Rudolph’s Nordhausen colleagues Haukohl, Schlidt,Palaoro, and Ball. Major Smith pointed out to Arthur Rudolph that Rudolph’soffice was directly adjacent to where the twelve so-called political prisonershad been hanged from the crane. As Arthur Rudolph continued to deny ever seeingprisoners abused, Smith found his testimony increasingly suspicious. Everyoneelse interviewed admitted to having seen some prisoner abuse. Rudolph wasadamant: “I did not see them punished, beaten, hung or shot,” he told MajorSmith.Smith approached the question in a different manner. He asked Rudolph if hecould recall anything about the twelve men who had been hanged from the crane.This public execution, Smith said, had been confirmed by many of Rudolph’scolleagues, and Smith was trying to put together an accurate portrait of whathad happened, and when. Rudolph replied, “[O]ne [dying prisoner] lifted hisknees, after I got there.” In other words, Rudolph had witnessed the executions.Major Smith was now convinced that the truth about what happened at Nordhausenwas being covered up, collectively, by the group, and that Arthur Rudolph knew alot more than he let on. But as Smith noted in his report, the subject of theinvestigation was Georg Rickhey, not Arthur Rudolph. “Mr. Rudolph impressed theundersigned as a very clever, shrewd individual,” Smith wrote. “He did not wishto become involved in any investigations that might involve him in any way withillegal actions in the underground factory and as a result, was cautious of hisanswers.”Smith returned to Washington and advised U.S. Army Air Forces Headquarters ofhis findings. In Germany, a serendipitous incident occurred at this same time.William Aalmans, the Dutch citizen who had been working on the U.S. War CrimesInvestigation Team, had been hunting down SS officers from Dora-Nordhausen foran upcoming regional war crimes trial. Aalmans had managed to locate only elevenout of three thousand SS officers [endnotes.xhtml#en0758] who had run theconcentration camp. Aalmans was the man who had interviewed many of the newlyliberated prisoners back in April 1945, and he was also the individual who hadfound the Mittelwerk employee telephone list tacked to the tunnel wall. The twonames at the top of that list were Georg Rickhey and Arthur Rudolph. Aalmans hadno idea that both men had been recruited into Operation Paperclip. In Germany,no one Aalmans interviewed claimed to know the whereabouts of either man. Then,one afternoon in May 1947, Aalmans was taking a break from his Nazi huntingwork, reading the Stars and Stripes newspaper in the sunshine, when, as he toldjournalist Tom Bower decades later, “I just saw a tiny headline[endnotes.xhtml#en0759], ‘German Scientist Applies for American Citizenship.’ ”The name mentioned was Georg Rickhey, Aalmans explained. “I screamed for joy andrushed into the head office shouting, ‘We’ve found him!’ ” Within three days theGeorg Rickhey matter had been escalated to the attention of the Joint Chiefs ofStaff.On May 19, 1947, an arrest warrant was issued for Georg Rickhey on orders fromthe War Crimes Branch, Civil Affairs Division, in Washington. “Georg Rickhey iswanted as a principal perpetrator in the Nordhausen Concentration Camp Case,”the document read. Rickhey’s immediate reaction was to claim he was beingfalsely accused. This was a case of mistaken identity, Rickhey declared. Inresponse, the Office of the Deputy Director of Intelligence, Headquarters,European Command, had this to say: “The Dr. Georg Rickhey now employed at WrightField and the Georg Rickhey engineer at Nordhausen are one and the same person.Dr. Karl Rahr, chief physician at Nordhausen, has been interrogated and statesthat he knew Rickhey, that he is now in his late 40’s [or] early 50’s and thatthere was only one Georg Rickhey at Nordhausen. This Group is makingarrangements [endnotes.xhtml#en0760] to have Rickhey returned to Germany fortrial in the Nordhausen Concentration camp case.” The War Department’sIntelligence Division assigned the chief of security at Wright Field, MajorGeorge P. Miller, the role of escorting Rickhey [endnotes.xhtml#en0761] back toGermany. Rickhey’s five-year contract was terminated. He was instead going to bea defendant in the Dora-Nordhausen war crimes trial.On June 2, 1947, JIOA deputy director Bosquet N. Wev wrote to J. Edgar Hoover,the powerful director of the FBI, alerting him of the situation and sendingalong Rickhey’s classified dossier. If the public learned that an OperationPaperclip scientist had been returned to Germany to stand trial for war crimes,the JIOA, the Army, the War Department, and the FBI would all have a lot ofexplaining to do. It was in everyone’s interest to keep the Georg Rickhey fiascounder wraps.On August 7, 1947, Georg Rickhey appeared as one of nineteen defendants in theDora-Nordhausen trial. The Nazis were charged with the deaths of at least twentythousand laborers [endnotes.xhtml#en0762] who were beaten, tortured, starved,hanged, or worked to death while being forced to build V-2 rockets. The trial,which took place inside a former SS barracks [endnotes.xhtml#en0763] adjacent tothe Dachau concentration camp, lasted four months and three weeks. Theprosecution requested that Wernher von Braun be allowed to testify at the trial,but the army said it was too much of a security risk to allow von Braun totravel to Germany. The Russians could kidnap him, the U.S. Army said. They didnot say that von Braun had recently traveled to Germany to marry his cousin andbring her back to Texas with him. At the end of the trial, fifteen of thenineteen defendants were found guilty. Four, including Georg Rickhey, wereacquitted. “Then, in an unprecedented move [endnotes.xhtml#en0764], the Armyclassified the entire trial record,” explains journalist Linda Hunt. The recordwould remain secret from the public for another forty years. There was far toomuch at stake for the U.S. Army to allow the information about what had reallygone on in the Nordhausen tunnel complex to get out to the public. The trialrecord would call attention to the backgrounds of the 115 rocket scientists atFort Bliss. The future of the United States missile program was too important.The Russians had their rocket scientists and America needed hers, too.Shortly after Rickhey was acquitted, back in Washington, D.C., the office of thesecretary of the air force received a call from the State Department. Theofficial identified himself as Henry Cox. The air force captain who took Cox’scall [endnotes.xhtml#en0765] wrote up a memo of what was said.“After exchanged pleasantries, [Cox] inquired if we had ever returned aspecialist to Europe for trial. I thought a moment and, realizing that theRickhey case was in the public domain and in all probability facts known to theState Department since his sister made inquiries, I did not dare deny the story.I, therefore, told Mr. Cox that one Air Force case had been returned to Europeunder suspicion, that my recollection was he was cleared; that in any event wedid not desire to take further chances on the case and that he had not beenreturned to the United States.” The State Department appeared to have bought thestory.Rickhey was gone, but there was no shortage of Nazis coming to Wright Field towork. On August 22, 1947, one of the Reich’s top ten pilots, Siegfried Knemeyer,arrived. This was the daring pilot and engineer whom Albert Speer had hopedwould help him to escape to Greenland and whom Hermann Göring had called “myboy.”“Knemeyer is very popular with his fellow nationals since he is a good mixer andfree of vanity,” read a memo in his intelligence dossier. “He is a diligentworker with an inventive mind. He is absorbed [endnotes.xhtml#en0766] by hiswork and especially enthusiastic about participating in aerial tests.” SoonKnemeyer’s wife, Doris, and their seven children arrived in America to join himand to become U.S. citizens. The family moved into a large, drafty farmhouse onYellow Springs Road. Doris Knemeyer hated provincial life[endnotes.xhtml#en0767] in Dayton, Ohio. In Berlin, the Knemeyers had a grandhome in the Charlottenburg district, with many servants to help take care of theKnemeyer brood. Raising seven children by herself in America was not what DorisKnemeyer had in mind. The difficulties at home did not go unnoticed byKnemeyer’s supervisors at Wright Field.“Since the arrival of his family he seems harassed and neglectful of hispersonal appearance,” read an internal security report. But Knemeyer wasdetermined to succeed. Assigned to the Communication and Navigation Laboratoryat Wright Field, Knemeyer found his stride. He began to make significantcontributions [endnotes.xhtml#en0768] to navigational instruments for his newemployer, the U.S. Air Force—no longer part of the army anymore. Knemeyer is “agenius in the creation [endnotes.xhtml#en0769] of new concepts in flightcontrol,” wrote Colonel John Martin, Knemeyer’s superior at the lab.Knemeyer’s friend Werner Baumbach, Hitler’s general of the bombers, had beenscheduled to come to Wright Field to work alongside Knemeyer, but an entry inBaumbach’s intelligence dossier noted that there had been a last-minute change[endnotes.xhtml#en0770]: “Lt. Colonel Baumbach has since been substituted,” itread. Baumbach went to Argentina instead, to train fighter pilots for JuanPerón. Whether he had been dropped from Operation Paperclip or Juan Perón hadoffered him a better deal remains a mystery. Werner Baumbach died a few yearslater after an airplane he was testing crashed into the Río de la Plata, nearUruguay.Also arriving at Wright Field in the summer of 1947 was General WalterDornberger, newly released from England’s Special Camp XI, outside Bridgend,South Wales (formerly Island Farm). Before turning General Dornberger over tothe Americans, the British labeled him a “menace of the first order[endnotes.xhtml#en0771]” and warned their Allied partners of his deceitfulnature. While holding Dornberger for war crimes, British intelligence hadeavesdropped on him and recorded what he said. When the Americans listened tothese secret audio recordings, they, too, concluded that Hitler’s former “chiefof all rocket and research development” had “an untrustworthy attitude inseeking to turn ally against ally.” Still, Dornberger signed a Paperclipcontract, on July 12, 1947, just weeks after his release from prison.Dornberger’s skill at manipulation was put to use by Army Ordnance, which hadhim write classified intelligence briefs. America needed to develop missilesregardless of what any naysayers might think, Dornberger believed.“Russia strives now only for time to prepare for war before the United States,”Dornberger wrote in a classified budget pitch, financed by the OrdnanceDepartment, in 1948. “The United States must decide upon a research anddevelopment program that will guarantee satisfactory results within the shortestpossible time and at the least expense. Such a program must[endnotes.xhtml#en0772] be set up even if its organization appears to violateAmerican economic ideals and American traditions in arms development,”Dornberger wrote. At least it could be said that Dornberger remained true to histotalitarian-leaning principles—his belief that democratic ideals and traditionscould be ignored in the quest for military supremacy. That the U.S. Armycondoned Dornberger’s idea appears never to have been made public before; hispitch was presented to Ordnance Department officials at the Pentagon. A copy ofthe classified document was found in 2012 in Dornberger’s personal papers keptin a German state archive.Opposition to Operation Paperclip gained momentum with America’s scientificelite. On February 1, 1947, the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) met inNew York City to ask President Truman to put an end to it. The Americanscientists saw the Nazi scientist program as a “drastic step in the search formilitary power.” When it was learned that some of the one thousand additionalGerman scientists on the Paperclip recruiting list were being hired forshort-term military work followed by longer-term positions at Americanuniversities, many were outraged [endnotes.xhtml#en0773]. “Certainly not wishingto jeopardize the legitimate needs of the national defense, and not advocatingthe policy of hatred and vengeance toward our former enemies, we neverthelessbelieve that a large-scale importation of German scientists… is not in keepingwith the best objectives of American domestic and foreign policy,” the membersof FAS wrote. One American scientist was more forthright. “Certainly any personwho can transfer loyalties from one idealology [sic] to another upon theshifting of a meal ticket is not better than Judas!” he said.Albert Einstein was the most esteemed figure to publicly denounce OperationPaperclip. In an impassioned letter, written on behalf of his FAS colleagues,Einstein appealed directly to President Truman. “We hold these individuals to bepotentially dangerous.… Their former eminence as Nazi Party members andsupporters raises the issue of their fitness to become American citizens andhold key positions in American industrial, scientific and educationalinstitutions.”Another important figure among the opposition was the nuclear physicist HansBethe. Bethe had fled Nazi Germany in 1933 and had worked on the ManhattanProject during the war. In the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Bethe and Dr.Henri Sack, a colleague from Cornell University, posed a series of simplequestions about Operation Paperclip. “Was it wise, or even compatible with ourmoral standards to make this bargain, in light of the fact that many of theGermans, probably the majority, were die-hard Nazis?” Bethe and Sack asked. “Didthe fact that the Germans might save the nation millions of dollars imply thatpermanent residence and citizenship could be bought? Could the United Statescount on [the German scientists] to work for peace when their indoctrinatedhatred against the Russians might contribute to increase the divergency betweenthe great powers? Had the war been fought to allow Nazi ideology to creep intoour educational and scientific institutions by the back door?” Their finalquestion struck at the dark heart of the Nazi scientist program. “Do we wantscience at any price?”The condemnation of Operation Paperclip by these leading American scientists andothers had a ripple effect on the general public. Reporters began searching forleads about individual German scientists’ wartime activities, but this proved analmost impossible effort given the program’s classified nature. Frustrated bythe lack of information, some Americans sent threatening letters[endnotes.xhtml#en0774] addressed to the German scientists at Wright Field andFort Bliss. The army tightened security and surveillance. In Washington, D.C.,the War Department was rightly concerned that intense opposition and badpublicity had put the entire program in jeopardy of collapse, and in the winterof 1947 the War Department forbade the further release of information about theprogram.Despite the precautions, two individuals from the program at Fort Bliss wereexposed by an angry public as “real Nazis”: Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Axster. HerbertAxster, a former lieutenant colonel in the Wehrmacht, had been a Nazi Partymember since 1940. He was not a scientist but rather a patent lawyer and anaccountant. At Peenemünde he worked as General Dornberger’s chief of staff. Hiswife, Ilse Axster, was a leader of NS-Frauenschaft, a Nazi Party organizationfor women. During a routine investigation of the Axsters conducted for theirvisa applications, neighbors in Germany told army intelligence[endnotes.xhtml#en0775] officers that Mrs. Axster was a particularly sadisticNazi. On the Axsters’ estate, the neighbors said, the couple kept forty“political prisoners,” Russians and Poles, whom they used as slave laborers. Theneighbors said Mrs. Axster was known to use a horsewhip on her servants. Thisinformation was first passed on to Rabbi Stephen Wise of the American JewishCongress and then to the press. “These scientists and their families aresupposed to have been ‘screened,’ Wise wrote to the War Department. “The Axstersprove that this ‘screening’ is a farce and the War Department ‘screeners’ areentirely incapable of performing this task.” The Department of Justice withdrewHerbert Axster’s application for legal immigration, but the Axsters were notsent home. Eventually they left Fort Bliss and Herbert Axster opened a law firm[endnotes.xhtml#en0776] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.The War Department cabled USFET demanding an explanation [endnotes.xhtml#en0777]as to how the Axsters got through the screening process. A classified cable wassent back, stating that a few “ardent Nazis” may have slipped into the programbased on “unavailability of records” immediately after the war."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEEN [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter014]STRANGE JUDGMENT [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter014]The doctors’ trial was the first of twelve subsequent war crimes trials atNuremberg wherein the U.S. government prosecuted individuals in specificprofessions—including industrialists, lawyers, and generals—who had served theThird Reich. The first trial, called the trial of the major war criminals, wasprosecuted by the four Allied powers. When it ended, in October 1946, tensionsbetween the Soviet Union and the United States had escalated to the degree thatcooperation between the two nations was no longer possible. The subsequenttwelve trials took place at the Palace of Justice, as the others had, but withonly American judges and prosecutors. The twenty-three defendants in thedoctors’ trial were charged with murder, torture, conspiracy, and atrocity inthe name of medical science. “Mere punishment of the defendants[endnotes.xhtml#en0778],” said Brigadier General Telford Taylor in his openingstatement, “can never redress the terrible injuries which the Nazis visited onthese unfortunate peoples.” But General Taylor reminded the tribunal and theworld that one of the central purposes of the trial was to establish a record ofproof of the crimes, “so that no one can ever doubt that they were fact and notfable; and that this court, as agent of the United States and as the voice ofhumanity, stamps these acts, and the ideas which engendered them, as barbarousand criminal.”Dr. Leopold Alexander, the Viennese-born American psychiatrist who had firstlearned of the Luftwaffe freezing experiments, helped General Taylor write hisopening speech. Dr. Alexander’s official title was expert consultant to thesecretary of war, but in layman’s terms he was the most influential personinvolved in the doctors’ trial after Telford Taylor. Dr. Alexander workedtirelessly to supply information and answers for the prosecution team as theyprepared to go to trial. He conducted hundreds of hours of pretrialinterrogations with the defendants and interviewed scores of witnesses andvictims. He was able to converse in both German and English and he tookextensive notes in both languages [endnotes.xhtml#en0779]. Throughout the trialDr. Alexander delivered presentations of evidence and cross-examined witnesses.When the trial was over he would be given credit for writing the Nuremberg Code[endnotes.xhtml#en0780].Of the twenty-three defendants, no one outside a small group of American medicalmilitary elite had any idea that four of the accused had already worked for theU.S. Army under Paperclip. This fact would remain secret for forty years.Neither Siegfried Ruff, nor Konrad Schäfer, Hermann Becker-Freyseng, nor OskarSchröder mentioned this damning fact during the trial.Siegfried Ruff was one of the few physicians who admitted he’d overseen themedical murders at Dachau but said he did not perform any of the experimentshimself. In his defense, he said he didn’t believe that what he did was wrong.“It was understood that concentration camp inmates who had been condemned todeath would be used in the experiments, and as compensation they were to havetheir sentences commuted to life in prison,” Ruff told the judges[endnotes.xhtml#en0781]. “Personally, I would not consider these experiments asimmoral especially in war time.” This line of defense, that extraordinary timescalled for extraordinary measures, was also used by Schröder andBecker-Freyseng.The strange case of Konrad Schäfer played a unique role in Operation Paperclip.Having invented the Schäfer process to separate salt from seawater, Schäfer wasclearly aware that concentration camp prisoners were going to be used in thetesting process. Schäfer’s superior, Oskar Schröder, chief of medical servicesfor the Luftwaffe, confirmed this under oath, “In May 1944, in order to discusswhat further steps should be taken, Becker-Freyseng and Schäfer attended [a]meeting as representatives of my office. As a result of the meeting it wasdecided to conduct further experiments on human beings being supplied by theReichsführer-SS, Heinrich Himmler.” It was Becker-Freyseng who drew up theletter, which was sent to Himmler, requesting more prisoners to conductexperiments on. But Schäfer said he never actually went to Dachau and noevidence placing him there survived the war. As for eyewitness testimony, allbut one of the saltwater experiment victims had been killed. The sole survivor,Karl Höllenrainer, was located by Dr. Alexander and put on the witness stand.Höllenrainer did not recognize Konrad Schäfer but he recognized one of hiscodefendants in the dock. Höllenrainer’s testimony proved to be one of the mostdramatic events in the doctors’ trial.It was June 27, 1947, and Karl Höllenrainer stood trembling in the hushedcourtroom. Small in stature, dark-haired, and nervous, he was a broken man.“Now, witness,” asked U.S. Prosecutor Alexander G. Hardy, “for what reason wereyou arrested by the Gestapo on May 29, 1944?”“Because I am a Gypsy of mixed blood,” Höllenrainer said.Höllenrainer’s crime was that he had fallen in love with and married a Germangirl, a violation of the infamous Nuremberg law that prohibited a non-Aryan frommarrying or having sexual relations with a German citizen. After being arrested,Höllenrainer was sent to three different concentration camps, first Auschwitz,then Buchenwald, and finally Dachau, where he was selected to take part in theseawater experiments being performed by Luftwaffe.At Dachau, Höllenrainer was deprived of food, forced to drink chemicallyprocessed seawater, and then monitored for signs of liver failure and madness.One experiment among the many stood out in his memory. Without using anesthesia,a Luftwaffe doctor had removed a piece of Karl Höllenrainer’s liver in order toanalyze it. Now, from the witness stand, Höllenrainer was asked to identify theNazi doctor who’d performed this liver puncture on him.“Do you think you would be able to recognize that doctor if you saw him today?”Prosecutor Hardy asked.“Yes,” said Höllenrainer. “I would recognize him at once.”Höllenrainer stared across the courtroom, his eyes focused sharply on one of thetwenty-three defendants sitting in the dock, Dr. Wilhelm Beiglböck, 40, theLuftwaffe doctor in charge of the saltwater experiments. Beiglböck had deepcrevices at each side of his mouth and five pronounced dueling scars[endnotes.xhtml#en0782] running across his left cheek.As Höllenrainer stared at Dr. Beiglböck, “everyone in the courtroom waitedtensely,” recalls Vivien Spitz, a young American court reporter whose job it wasto take down the testimony. Spitz sat in front of the judges, within clear viewof the witnesses and defendants. Höllenrainer “was a little man and I watchedhim stand up,” she explains. The prosecutor asked Höllenrainer to proceed to thedefendants’ dock to identify the doctor who’d removed a piece of his liverwithout anesthesia.“He paused for just a moment,” Vivien Spitz remembers, “with his eyes seeming tobe fixed on a doctor in the second row of the prisoners’ dock. Then, in a[flash] he was gone from the witness stand!”Karl Höllenrainer sprang into action. To Vivien Spitz’s eye, Höllenrainer seemedto leap over the German defense counsels’ tables and “appeared to be almostflying through the air toward the prisoners’ dock.” In his right hand, stretchedup high in the air, Karl Höllenrainer clutched a dagger [endnotes.xhtml#en0783],Vivien Spitz recalls. “He was reaching [endnotes.xhtml#en0784] for Dr.Beiglböck, the consulting physician to the German Air Force.”There was shock in the courtroom [endnotes.xhtml#en0785]. Confusion and mayhem.The Nazis’ defense attorneys scrambled to get out of Höllenrainer’s way. ThreeAmerican military police rushed forward and grabbed Höllenrainer. Vivien Spitzremembers how security “subdued” Karl Höllenrainer just before he reachedBeiglböck, “preventing him from delivering his own brand of justice.”It took minutes for order to be restored in the courtroom. The military policeset Karl Höllenrainer before Presiding Judge Walter Beals, who was furious.Seventy years old, overworked and in failing health, Judge Beals clung to theidea that his primary role at Nuremberg was to educate the German people in theways of American democracy and due process.“Witness!” thundered the judge. “You were summoned before this Tribunal as awitness to give evidence.”“Yes,” Karl Höllenrainer meekly replied.“This is a court of justice,” roared Beals.“Yes,” said Höllenrainer, trembling worse than before.“And by your conduct in attempting to assault the defendant Beiglböck in thedock, you have committed a contempt of this court!”Karl Höllenrainer pleaded with the judge. “Your Honor, please excuse my conduct.I am very upset—”The judge interrupted and asked if the witness had anything else to say inextenuation of his conduct.“Your Honor, please excuse me. I am so worked up. That man is a murderer,”Höllenrainer begged, pointing to the expressionless Dr. Beiglböck. “He hasruined my whole life!”The judge told Höllenrainer that his statement did not make his conductforgivable. That he had insulted the court. That it was the judgment of thetribunal that he be confined in the Nuremberg prison for a period of ninetydays, as punishment for insulting due process.Karl Höllenrainer spoke in a tidy, pleading voice. The power and conviction thathad allowed him to almost fly across the courtroom with the intent of stabbingDr. Beiglböck with his dagger was gone. Now Höllenrainer was on the edge oftears. “Would the Tribunal please forgive me?” Höllenrainer asked. “I am marriedand I have a small son.” He pointed at Dr. Beiglböck. “This man is a murderer.He gave me salt water and he performed a liver puncture on me. I am still undermedical treatment.” Karl Höllenrainer pleaded for mercy from Judge Beals.“Please, do not send me to prison.”The judge saw no room for clemency. Instead, Beals asked a guard to remove KarlHöllenrainer from the courtroom, referring to him as a “prisoner” now.“My heart broke [endnotes.xhtml#en0786],” Vivien Spitz recalls. All she could dowas lower her head. She was a professional court reporter and it wasinappropriate for anyone to see that she was crying. Sixty years later, whenrecollecting the incident, she still wondered why Judge Beals did what he did.“It was impossible to be dispassionate.… Why ninety days? Why not one or twodays—just to make a point? After all the torture the witness had suffered itseemed to me to be an outrageous elevation of process over substance.”Karl Höllenrainer was removed from the courtroom. He was led down a long, securecorridor and into the prison complex, the same location where Dr. Beiglböck andall of the other Nazi war criminals were being held. It had been Dr. Alexanderwho had made the decision to put Karl Höllenrainer on the witness stand, and inhis journal he wrote about how conflicted he felt [endnotes.xhtml#en0787] abouthis decision. Dr. Alexander had spoken with Höllenrainer ten days before hetestified against Beiglböck and was aware how upset Höllenrainer was, noting ina report how his hands shook. Karl Höllenrainer shared with Dr. Alexander thathe suffered from a “tremendous feeling of inner rage [endnotes.xhtml#en0788]”whenever he thought about what had happened to him at the Dachau concentrationcamp. Höllenrainer felt powerless, he said. He could close his eyes and “see thedoctor in front of him who… had ruined his life and killed three of hisfriends.” Dr. Alexander knew how powerful Höllenrainer’s testimony would be. Hewas the only known victim of the saltwater experiments to have survived. Witnesstestimony was powerful, as his proved to be.The thought of him being confined in a prison with the very doctors who hadtortured him was unacceptable to Dr. Alexander, and that night he went to JudgeBeals to advocate on Höllenrainer’s behalf. The judge showed clemency andreleased him, on bail, into Alexander’s custody. Four days later, on July 1,1947, Karl Höllenrainer was allowed to continue his testimony[endnotes.xhtml#en0789]. He rose to the occasion and provided harrowing detailsabout what dying of thirst does to a man. He described how his friends “foamedat the mouth.” How “they had fits of raving madness” before succumbing to anagonizing death.One of the Nazi doctors’ defense lawyers, Herr Steinbauer, was given anopportunity to cross-examine Karl Höllenrainer. Steinbauer accused Höllenrainerof lying.“How can there be foam on a mouth which is completely dried out?” Steinbauerasked.Höllenrainer said he was telling the truth.“Listen, Herr Höllenrainer,” Steinbauer said, “don’t be evasive as Gypsiesusually are. Give me a clear answer as a witness under oath.”Höllenrainer attempted to answer.“You Gypsies stick together, don’t you? [endnotes.xhtml#en0790]” Steinbauerinterrupted.The exchange could have served as a metaphor for the whole trial. Through theeyes of a Nazi it was and always would be the Übermenschen versus theUntermenschen. It was why General Taylor’s opening remarks sent such a powerfulmessage. It wasn’t just the acts of the Nazi doctors that were “barbarous andcriminal” but the very ideas that had engendered such acts.Late at night, Dr. Alexander wrote a private letter to General Telford Taylor[endnotes.xhtml#en0791] stating how he felt about the Nazi doctors on trial. “Ifeel that all of the accused today, Schaefer, Becker-Freyseng and Beiglböck,would admit that this problem [seawater drinkability] could have been solved inone afternoon with a piece of jelly [and] a salt solution.” Instead, Dr.Alexander wrote, “All of these men on the dock slaughtered for gain ofscientific renown [and] personal advancement. They were like Tantalus, amythical, ambitious ruler who slew his own child for reward.”In a letter to his wife, Dr. Alexander penned a fascinating reveal: “Dr.Beiglböck from Vienna, turns out to have been in the same class with me duringour final year at medical school,” before the war. The way Dr. Alexanderremembered it [endnotes.xhtml#en0792], Beiglböck was caught cheating and had toleave the school. “He does not recognize me,” Dr. Alexander told his wife, “butI regularly recognize him.” Two men whose professional lives had begun sosimilarly had taken such radically diffent paths.There was another dramatic turning point in the doctors’ trial, and thatinvolved the case of Dr. Kurt Blome. Blome was admittedly the director ofbiological weapons research for the Reich, which was not in itself a crime. Butthere were scores of documents [endnotes.xhtml#en0793] in which Blome discussedthe need to conduct experiments on human beings so as to further plague researchat the Bacteriological Institute in Posen, where he was in charge. Blome’sdefense [endnotes.xhtml#en0794], some of which he argued himself, was that heintended to experiment on humans but that he never actually performed theexperiments. Intent, said Blome, was not a crime. The prosecution had beenunable to find any witnesses to testify against Blome, and Blome used this factin his defense. There was the testimony of Major General Walter Schreiberagainst Blome from the first Nuremberg trial, but the Soviets had refused to letDr. Alexander interview Dr. Schreiber himself, so the veracity of his testimonywas never independently verified. The prosecution presented many documents inwhich Blome discussed with Himmler his plans to experiment on humans. But therewere no documents showing Blome’s actual guilt. There was another element ofBlome’s defense that the prosecution was completely unprepared for, and that wasDr. Blome’s wife, Bettina, a physician and bestselling author. Frau Blomemeticulously researched experiments that were conducted by the U.S. Office ofScientific Research and Development (OSRD) during the war. This included malariaexperiments on Terre Haute federal prison inmates. She also uncovered Dr. WalterReed’s famous nineteenth-century yellow fever research for the U.S. Army, inwhich volunteer human test subjects had died. The defense counsel, RobertServatius, picked up on this theme of U.S. Army human experimentation whereBlome’s wife left off.Servatius had located a Life magazine article, published in June of 1945, thatdescribed how OSRD conducted experiments on eight hundred U.S. prisoners duringthe war. Servatius read the entire article, word for word, in the courtroom.None of the American judges was familiar with the article, nor were most membersof the prosecution, and its presentation in court clearly caught the Americansoff guard. Because the article specifically discussed U.S. Army wartimeexperiments on prisoners, it was incredibly damaging for the prosecution.“Prison life is ideal for controlled laboratory work with humans,” Servatiusread, quoting American doctors who had been interviewed by Life reporters. Theidea that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures, and that bothnations had used human test subjects during war, was unsettling. It pushed thecore Nazi concept of the Untermenschen to the side. The Nuremberg prosecutorswere left looking like hypocrites [endnotes.xhtml#en0795].On August 6, 1947, the verdicts were read. Seven defendants were given deathsentences, and nine were given prison sentences of between ten years and life,including Beiglböck (fifteen years), Becker-Freyseng (twenty years), andSchröder (life). Seven Nazi doctors were acquitted [endnotes.xhtml#en0796],including Blome, Schäfer, Ruff, and Weltz. Of Blome’s acquittal, the Nurembergjudges noted, “It may well be that defendant Blome was preparing to experimenton human beings in connection with bacteriological warfare, but the record failsto disclose that fact, or that he ever actually conducted the experiments.”Konrad Schäfer returned to work at the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center inHeidelberg where he assumed Dr. Strughold’s former position as chief of staff.Strughold had already set sail for America as part of Operation Paperclip andwas now in Texas, serving as “professional advisor [endnotes.xhtml#en0797]” toColonel Armstrong, the commandant of the School of Aviation Medicine at RandolphField. Armstrong had set up a new aeromedical research laboratory there and wasin the process of bringing dozens of Hitler’s former doctors to Texas to conductmedical research. Hubertus Strughold’s job description also included “overallsupervision of [endnotes.xhtml#en0798] the professional activities of the Germanand Austrian scientists [to be] employed by the School.” Meanwhile, the FBI washaving difficulty getting approval for Strughold’s visa application forimmigration into the United States. The Bureau had conducted a special inquiryinto Dr. Strughold back in Germany. “One informant, who had known the subject,”investigators learned, said that Strughold “had expressed the opinion that theNazi party had done a great deal for Germany. He [Strughold] said that prior toNazism, the Jews had crowded the medical schools [endnotes.xhtml#en0799] and ithad been nearly impossible for others to enroll.” To counterbalance thisderogatory depiction of Strughold, Dr. Konrad Schäfer was asked to write aletter of recommendation for his former boss. In a sworn statement written justa few weeks after Schäfer was acquitted at Nuremberg, Schäfer praised Dr.Strughold for his “ethical principles [endnotes.xhtml#en0800]” while conductingresearch work. “I also know that he strictly refused to take part [in] or permitscientific research work which was damaging to human health,” Schäfer wrote. Thefollowing year, Dr. Konrad Schäfer would be on a boat headed for America, anOperation Paperclip contract in hand.As for Dr. Blome, he was seen as a highly desirable recruit for OperationPaperclip. Blome allegedly knew more about bubonic plague research than anyoneelse in the world. But, given his former position in Hitler’s inner circle,coupled with the fact that Blome had worn the Golden Party Badge, bringing himto America as part of Operation Paperclip remained too difficult for the U.S.Army to justify. But as the Cold War gained momentum and intense suspicion ofthe Soviets increased, even someone like Kurt Blome would eventually be deemedeligible for Operation Paperclip."},{"pageContent":"PART IV [toc.xhtml#toc-part004]“Only the commander understands the importance of certain things, and he aloneconquers and surmounts all difficulties. An army is nothing without the head.”—Napoleon"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEEN [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter015]CHEMICAL MENACE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter015]It had been nearly a year since State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee Paper No.275/5 authorized JIOA to import one thousand Nazi scientists from Germany so asto deny them to the Russians. For the JIOA, things were not happening nearlyfast enough. The number of Operation Paperclip scientists who had come toAmerica in this time frame had nearly doubled, from 175 in March 1946 to 344 inFebruary 1947, but none of these scientists had been granted visas yet. JIOAofficials perceived State Department official Samuel Klaus to be the man mostresponsible for the holdup. On February 27, 1947, Klaus was called into ameeting in the Pentagon with his military counterparts. There, JIOA directorColonel Thomas Ford told Klaus that he had a list of German scientists alreadyin the United States whose visas needed to be expedited. He asked Samuel Klausto sign a waiver that would allow JIOA to begin this process.Klaus refused to rubber-stamp anything. “I told him that of course I could do nosuch thing and that certification presupposed that the Department should have anopportunity to pass judgment of some kind before affixing the signature,” hewrote in a State Department memo [endnotes.xhtml#en0801]. Colonel Ford remindedKlaus of the language in a recent JIOA directive dated September 3, 1946.According to the directive, the Department of State was to “accept as final theinvestigation and security reports [endnotes.xhtml#en0802] prepared by JIOA, forinsuring final clearance of individuals concerned.” Klaus told Ford that hewould not sign a document that was essentially a blanket waiver of anything—thathe would have to see the list of scientists first.Ford told Klaus that the list was classified and that he did not have theclearance to see it. Klaus still refused to sign off on it. “Ford stated invarious ways that if I did not accept the paper on behalf of the StateDepartment he would give the information to several senators who would take careof the Department,” Klaus wrote of Ford’s threat. Colonel Ford accused him ofstanding in the way of “national interest.”Colonel Ford’s request was likely influenced by information the JIOA hadrecently received from the Office of the Military Government in Germany. Aftermonths of negative press attention directed at Operation Paperclip, spearheadedby the Federation of American Scientists and given further momentum by theAmerican Jewish Congress’s having identified the Axsters, of Fort Bliss, as“real Nazis,” the War Department had asked OMGUS to conduct an internal reviewof the Operation Paperclip scientists working in the United States. It was OMGUSin Germany that oversaw the reports on all the German scientists issued by ArmyIntelligence, G-2. The War Department told OMGUS that it did not want to have todeal with any other exposés.In response, OMGUS sent the War Department 146 security reports that couldpotentially create scandals were the information contained in them to berevealed. One report pertained to rocket engineer Kurt Debus. Debus was anardent Nazi. He had been an active SS member who, according to the testimony ofcolleagues, wore his Nazi uniform to work [endnotes.xhtml#en0803]. Mosttroublesome was the revelation in his OMGUS security report[endnotes.xhtml#en0804] that during the war he had turned a colleague, anengineering supervisor named Richard Craemer, over to the Gestapo for makinganti-Nazi remarks and for refusing to give Debus the Nazi salute. From Nazi-erapaperwork, it was clear that Debus had initiated the investigation into Craemer.No one else had heard the conversation between the two scientists; Debus hadgone home after work and taken it upon himself to write up a report of what wasallegedly said, which he had then submitted, in transcript form[endnotes.xhtml#en0805], to the SS. The specifics of the incident made itimpossible for the European Intelligence Division of the U.S. Army to cast KurtDebus as an apolitical scientist trying to survive in a fascist world. Debus hadgone out of his way to have a colleague arrested by the Gestapo. Craemer wassubsequently prosecuted for treason. According to the report, and as a result ofDebus’s actions, on November 30, 1942, “Craemer [endnotes.xhtml#en0806] wascalled to Gestapo H.Q. and confronted with this damning evidence.” The armyintelligence officer assigned to the case, Captain F. C. Groves, explained whathappened next. On April 5, 1942, “he [Craemer] was dragged before a‘Sondergericht’ [a special Nazi court] and sentenced to 2 years imprisonment.”Groves’s lengthy summary and analysis of the incident was sent to the JointChiefs of Staff. Debus’s “deliberate and vicious denunciation [of] Craemer” wasnot something army intelligence could disavow, wrote Groves. It was a matter ofpublic record in Germany.An OMGUS report put von Braun on equally shaky footing, and army intelligencecautioned that, given his international profile, pushing the State Departmentfor a visa for von Braun could cause problems. The report revealed that not onlyhad von Braun been an SS officer with the high rank of SS-Sturmbannführer, orSS-Major, but his membership had been sponsored by Heinrich Himmler[endnotes.xhtml#en0807]. In response, JIOA director Colonel Ford proposedcontrary action to what was being advised. Ford believed that the best solutionwas to get these undesirables on an even faster track toward citizenship. IfKlaus signed the waiver, JIOA could expedite the process.With Klaus refusing to sign [endnotes.xhtml#en0808] the documents, the situationescalated into a standoff. Klaus left the meeting and did some investigativework on his own. In the months that followed, he learned what had transpiredwith Georg Rickhey at Wright Field—that Rickhey had been returned to Germany tostand trial for alleged war crimes. The information had purposely been withheldfrom the State Department. In a memo to the undersecretary of state, Klausdefended his opposition to the JIOA’s bullish requests to have him sign a blindwaiver. “That the department’s security fears were not baseless was recentlydemonstrated when a war criminal, wanted for war crimes of a bestial kind, wasfound here among these scientists, to be returned to Germany.” Klaus wasdetermined to hold his ground, but so was the JIOA. The difficulty for Klaus wasthat he was outnumbered.The same month that the standoff between the State Department and the JIOAbegan, the Chemical Corps finally imported its first German scientist, an expertin tabun nerve agent synthesis [endnotes.xhtml#en0809] named Dr. Friedrich“Fritz” Hoffmann. The U.S. Army had been interested in stockpiling tabun eversince it obtained its first sample from the Robbers’ Lair, in the British zonein Germany, in May of 1945. The man in charge of the tabun nerve agent programfor the Chemical Corps was Colonel Charles E. Loucks, commander of the ArmyChemical Center at Edgewood Arsenal, in Maryland.The fifty-one-year-old Colonel Loucks had dedicated his life[endnotes.xhtml#en0810] to chemical warfare. Born and raised in California,Charles E. Loucks received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Stanford Universityand first became fascinated by war gas while serving in World War I. During hisassignment with the first Gas Regiment at Edgewood Arsenal, in 1922, his life’spath seemed to have been set. While Loucks distinguished himself as an expertrifleman, competing in National Rifle and Pistol matches and winning awards,chemical weapons fascinated him the most. He went back to school, to theMassachusetts Institute of Technology, to study chemical engineering, and in1929 he received a Master of Science degree. By 1935 Loucks was the technicaldirector of Chemical Warfare Service, Research and Development, at Edgewood. Hehad served as an officer with chemical weapons ever since.Major Loucks spent the first year of World War II refining the U.S. military’sstandard-issue gas mask. He even worked with Walt Disney and the Sun RubberCompany to transform the spooky, apocalyptic-looking face protector into a morekid-friendly version with a Mickey Mouse face [endnotes.xhtml#en0811]. In August1942, Loucks was made commander of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, outside Denver,Colorado, where he was in charge of planning, building, and operating thelargest-capacity toxic manufacturing plant in the United States. Rocky Mountainproduced mustard gas and incendiary bombs [endnotes.xhtml#en0812] on anindustrial scale—incendiary bombs that were dropped on Germany and Japan. Louckswas awarded the Legion of Merit for his war service.During the war the U.S. Army had more than four hundred battalions[endnotes.xhtml#en0813] ready for chemical combat. If chemical warfare brokeout, the army expected it would involve mustard gas. Sixty thousand soldierstrained in chemical warfare were sent into battle with gas masks and protectivesuits, carrying a small card that explained what to do in the event of achemical attack. Fortunately, World War II ended without the use of chemicalweapons, but experts like Charles Loucks [endnotes.xhtml#en0814] were caught offguard when they learned just how outperformed America’s chemists had been byHitler’s. With the discovery that the Nazis had mass-produced previously unknownagents like tabun and sarin gas came the realization that if Germany hadinitiated chemical warfare it would have been a grossly uneven match. Sincewar’s end, the army’s Chemical Corps had received 530 tons of tabun, courtesy ofthe British, who had seized the Reich’s colossal cache from the Robbers’ Lair.But the Chemical Corps had yet to produce much tabun on its own, which is whyDr. Fritz Hoffmann had been brought to America under Operation Paperclip.Hoffmann arrived [endnotes.xhtml#en0815] in February 1947 and immediately got towork synthesizing tabun. Nerve agents were Hoffmann’s area of expertise; he hadsynthesized poison gas at the Luftwaffe’s Technical Academy, Berlin-Gatow, andalso at the chemical warfare laboratories at the University of Würzburg duringthe war.Fritz Hoffmann was a gigantic man, six foot four, with dark eyes, sharp, angularfeatures, and high cheekbones. He kept his hair combed back behind the ears,perhaps with the help of hair oil. Hoffmann was a gifted organic chemist and acontemplative man who also had a PhD in philosophy [endnotes.xhtml#en0816]. Hehad suffered from polio as a child. According to the State Department, he wasone of the minority of individuals recruited into Operation Paperclip who hadbeen anti-Nazi during the war. When Hoffmann was captured at war’s end hecarried with him an unusual document, an affidavit from the U.S. Embassy inZurich, Switzerland, signed by American Consul General Sam E. Woods. “The bearerof this document… Dr. Frederick Wilhelm Hoffmann [was] anti-Nazi during thewhole war,” the document stated. It further explained that Hoffmann’sfather-in-law, the German economist Dr. Erwin Respondek, had risked life andlimb [endnotes.xhtml#en0817] to work as a spy for the Americans during the war.Respondek “rendered extremely valuable services to the Allied war effort,” wroteConsul General Woods. “These services, which are known to the former Secretaryof State, the Honorable Cordell Hull, were rendered at great personal risk tohimself and family, were performed without compensation and were so valuable toour cause that… every courtesy and help should be accorded” to all members ofthe family, including Respondek’s son-in-law, Fritz Hoffmann, the affidavitread.After being interrogated by army intelligence in Germany, Hoffmann was found“fit for exploitation for the Office of the Military Government, United States.”He was sent to the Army Chemical Center in Berlin, where he started working forthe Chemical Warfare Service until his Operation Paperclip contract wasfinalized.When Friedrich Hoffmann arrived at Edgewood Arsenal in February 1947, America’spremier chemical weapons research and development facility had been producingwar gases for thirty years. The three-thousand-acre peninsula, thick with fieldand forest, was located twenty miles northeast of Baltimore, Maryland, on theChesapeake Bay. Because Fritz Hoffmann was the first German at Edgewood thusfar, he was quartered inside a barracks [endnotes.xhtml#en0818] with Americansoldiers. The Top Secret research and development division he had been assignedto was called the Technical Command, and it was there that he began work“synthesizing new insecticides [endnotes.xhtml#en0819], rodenticides andmiticides,” which meant tabun.Colonel Loucks had been ordered by the Chemical Corps to determine how toproduce tabun on an industrial scale under a classified program code-named AI.13[endnotes.xhtml#en0820]. Army intelligence believed the Soviets’ chemicalweapons program to be considerably ahead of its own, and the Chemical Corps wasunder pressure to catch up [endnotes.xhtml#en0821]. The Soviets had captured theentire IG Farben laboratory at Dyhernfurth and had since reassembled it outsideStalingrad, in the town of Beketovka, under the codename Chemical Works No. 91.In addition to having the laboratory and the science, the Soviets had alsocaptured some of the Farben chemists who had worked at Dyhernfurth. Throughtheir own version of Operation Paperclip, a parallel exploitation program calledOperation Osoaviakhim, the Soviets captured German chemist Dr. von Bock andmembers of his team. The group was taken to Chemical Works No. 91, where vonBock, an expert in air filtration systems, decontamination systems, andhermetically sealed production compartments, was put to work. Von Bock’sesoteric knowledge gave the Soviets access to critical technical aspects ofproducing tabun. The hope was that Fritz Hoffmann could bring the Americans upto speed at Edgewood [endnotes.xhtml#en0822].Indeed, Fritz Hoffmann proved to be a great asset for the classified program.Within months of his arrival at Edgewood he was delivering “work of a high order[endnotes.xhtml#en0823]” and had “shown considerable ingenuity and excellentknowledge,” according to a declassified internal review of his performance.Tabun work progressed. When military intelligence learned that the Soviets’Chemical Works No. 91 was also producing sarin, Edgewood was told to continueworking on tabun but also to redouble efforts [endnotes.xhtml#en0824] in sarinproduction, with a plan to start producing it on an industrial scale as soon aspossible. Project AI.13 was given even higher priority and a new code name,Project AI.13-2.1. In Germany, Nazi scientists with knowledge of tabun and sarinwere now being even more aggressively sought for recruitment into OperationPaperclip.Declassified documents reveal that the Chemical Corps wanted to employ OttoAmbros, but he was not available. Ambros was incarcerated inside the prisoncomplex at Nuremberg, awaiting a war crimes trial. Imprisoned alongside Ambroswere fellow Farben board members Fritz Ter Meer and Karl Krauch as well asHermann Schmitz, Farben’s powerful CEO and the man who kept the Auschwitzscrapbook hidden in a secret wall safe. SS-Brigadeführer Dr. Walter Schieber,Ambros’s liaison to the Speer ministry and the man who oversaw the work atDyhernfurth, was also high on the Paperclip target list, but recruitment ofSchieber would have to wait. Schieber was also being held at Nuremberg. The IGFarben trial, officially called United States of America v. Carl Krauch et al.,[endnotes.xhtml#en0825] was scheduled to begin in a few months, in the summer of1947. Time would tell who, if any, of Hitler’s chemists would become available.It had been a little over four months since the New York Times had broken thestory of Operation Paperclip, and the negative attention to the program had notsubsided. Then, on March 9, 1947, journalist Drew Pearson reported the mostoutrageous news story about Operation Paperclip to date. According to Pearson[endnotes.xhtml#en0826], the U.S. Army had offered Farben executive Karl Kraucha Paperclip contract while he was incarcerated at Nuremberg. Krauch was the leaddefendant in the upcoming war crimes trial. He had served as Göring’splenipotentiary for chemical production and had advocated for the use[endnotes.xhtml#en0827] of nerve agents against the Allies. Krauch was the manwho galvanized his fellow German industrialists to mobilize resources to helpthe Nazis go to war.Drew Pearson’s column, “Washington Merry-Go-Round,” was widely read and highlyinfluential, and the report about Krauch caused such a scandal that GeneralEisenhower, the U.S. Army chief of staff, demanded to know what was going onwith Operation Paperclip. The man who briefed Eisenhower [endnotes.xhtml#en0828]was chief of military intelligence Stephen J. Chamberlin. After what wasreported to be a twenty-minute meeting, General Eisenhower remained in supportof the Paperclip program. For the military chiefs inside the JIOA, the problemswith the public’s perception of Paperclip were almost universally blamed on theState Department. Dean Rusk, who worked in the office of the assistant secretaryof war, summed up JIOA’s attitude toward the State Department in a memorandumthe day after the Eisenhower briefing. “The public relations[endnotes.xhtml#en0829] people are feeling mounting pressure on the Germanscientist business.… Our position is inherently weak because the StateDepartment finds this whole program difficult to support.”The JIOA decided it was time to get rid of Samuel Klaus [endnotes.xhtml#en0830].Director Thomas Ford wrote General Stephen Chamberlin saying that Klaus was“obnoxiously difficult [endnotes.xhtml#en0831]” and needed to be removed. Withinthe week, Klaus was transferred from the visa section of the State Department tothe Office of the Legal Adviser. He no longer had any say over the policies andprocedures regarding Operation Paperclip. It remains a mystery if Klaus hadanything to do with the public’s perception of the program, but in years tocome, and as McCarthyism expanded, Klaus would be accused of having leakednegative stories about the German scientist program to the press. But even withKlaus banished from the program, for the first time since Paperclip’s inceptionin the spring of 1945, the entire operation was now in danger of collapse.Assistant Secretary of War Howard Petersen worried with colleagues that the WarDepartment would be buried in scandals [endnotes.xhtml#en0832] involving Naziscientists. Petersen predicted that the whole program would be shut down in amatter of months.Instead the opposite happened. With the signing of the National Security Act byPresident Truman, on July 26, 1947, America’s armed services and intelligenceagencies were restructured. The War Department was reconstituted into theDepartment of Defense, the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee became theNational Security Council, and the Central Intelligence Agency was born[endnotes.xhtml#en0833].A new age was dawning for the controversial Paperclip program. On the one hand,it struggled to hold up a false face of scientific prowess behind which lay atawdry group of amoral war opportunists, many of whom were linked to war crimes.But just as von Braun admitted to New Yorker writer Daniel Lang that what hereally cared most about was seeing “how the golden cow could be milked mostsuccessfully,” the newly created CIA saw the Paperclip scientists in similarquid pro quo terms. There was advantage to be had in using men who hadeverything to lose and were, at the same time, uniquely focused on personalgain.In Operation Paperclip the CIA found a perfect partner in its quest forscientific intelligence. And it was in the CIA that Operation Paperclip foundits strongest supporting partner yet.Sometime in the spring of 1947, scientists at Edgewood Arsenal began conductinghuman experiments with tabun nerve agent. All soldiers used in these experimentswere so-called volunteers, but the men were not made privy to the fact that theywere being subjected to low-level concentrations of tabun. Some of the teststook place in Utah, at the Dugway Proving Ground. Other tests took place insideEdgewood’s “gassing chamber for human tests,” a 9 x 9-foot tile-and-brick cubewith an airtight metal door. One of the people observing the tabun tests[endnotes.xhtml#en0834] was Dr. L. Wilson Greene, technical director of theChemical and Radiological Laboratories at the Army Chemical Center at Edgewoodand a close collaborator of Fritz Hoffmann’s. Greene was a short man[endnotes.xhtml#en0835] with a square jaw and a barrel chest. What he lacked inheight he made up for in vision. While observing the behavior of the soldiers inthe tabun gas experiments, L. Wilson Greene had a revelation.Greene noticed that, after soldiers were put in the “gassing chamber,” theybecame “partially disabled for from one to three weeks with fatigue, lassitude,complete loss of initiative and interest, and apathy.” What struck Greene mostwas that the men were wholly incapacitated for a period of time but notpermanently injured. The men recovered entirely on their own; the antidote wastime. Dr. L. Wilson Greene saw in this a new kind of warfare. He sat down andbegan outlining his idea for America’s war-fighting future in an opus that wouldbecome known as “Psychochemical Warfare: A New Concept of War.” In themonograph, Greene wrote, “The trend of each major conflict, being characterizedby increased death, human misery, and property destruction, could be reversed.”His seminal vision [endnotes.xhtml#en0836] for psychochemical warfare—a term hecoined—was to incapacitate a man with drugs on the battlefield but not to killhim. Greene believed that in this way the face of warfare could change frombarbaric to human. Incapacitating agents were “gentle” weapons; they knocked aman out without permanent injury. With psychochemical warfare, Greene explained,America could conquer its enemies “without the wholesale killing of people orthe mass destruction of property.”Greene was not proposing to use low levels of tabun gas on the battlefield. Hewas talking about using other kinds of incapacitating agents, drugs that couldimmobilize or temporarily paralyze a person, “hallucinogenic or psychotomimeticdrugs [endnotes.xhtml#en0837]… whose effects mimic insanity or psychosis.”“There can be no doubt [endnotes.xhtml#en0838] that their will to resist wouldbe weakened greatly, if not entirely destroyed, by the mass hysteria and panicwhich would ensue,” Greene explained.Greene proposed that an immediate “search be made for a stable chemical compoundwhich would cause mental abnormalities of military significance.” He soughtdrugs that made people irrational. In his monograph, Greene provided the armywith a list of “61 materials known to cause mental disorders.” These sixty-onecompounds [endnotes.xhtml#en0839], he said, should be studied and refined todetermine which single compound would be the best possible incapacitating agentsfor U.S. military use. Greene requested a budget of fifty thousand dollars,roughly half a million dollars in 2013, which was granted. Research began.Greene assigned his colleague and friend Fritz Hoffmann the job of researching amultitude of toxins for potential military use.Fritz Hoffmann was by now recognized at Edgewood [endnotes.xhtml#en0840] as oneof the most gifted organic chemists in the Chemical Corps. If anyone could findand prepare the ideal incapacitating agent for the battlefield, Hoffmann could.He began a broad spectrum of research on everything from well-known street drugsto highly obscure toxins from the third world. There was mescaline, obtainedfrom the peyote cactus and used by Native American Indians, with side effectsranging from divination to boredom. He studied fly agaric, a hallucinogenicmushroom found on the barren slopes of Mongolia and rumored to facilitatecontact with the spirit world, and piruri, a toxic vegetable leaf fromAustralia, used by Aborigines, that was found to suppress thirst. Yaxee andepena, from Venezuela, Colombia, and Brazil, caused people to see things thatweren’t really there. It was a drug that for centuries had been “used byprimitive tribes to escape the realities of their plight by using hallucinogenicproperties.” Soon Hoffmann would travel the world [endnotes.xhtml#en0841] insearch of these incapacitating agents on behalf of the Chemical Corps.Dr. Greene’s idea of psychochemical warfare would have a profound effect on thefuture of the U.S. Army’s Chemical Corps, but it would also greatly affect thedirection of the newest civilian intelligence organization in Washington, theCIA. The Agency had deep pockets and big ideas. For the CIA, using drugs toincapacitate individuals had many more applications than just on thebattlefield, and the Agency began developing programs of its own. Fritz Hoffmannand L. Wilson Greene were at the locus of a growing partnership being forgedbetween the Chemical Corps and the CIA. Soon, biological warfare experts fromCamp Detrick would also be brought into the fold. This particular biologicalweapons program, which would be run by a group called Special OperationsDivision, or SO Division, was fueled by Operation Paperclip and would developinto one of the most controversial and collaborative efforts in the history ofthe CIA.It had been a year and a half since the Merck Report on the biological weaponsthreat had been released, and an influx of congressional funding had transformedCamp Detrick into a state-of-the-art bioweapons research and developmentfacility. The army purchased 545 acres of land adjacent to what had been called“Area A” and created a new area, designated “Area B,” where some of Detrick’sfirst postwar field tests with crop dusters and spray hoses would occur. Duringthe war, dangerous pathogens like anthrax and “X” had been tested and culturedinside Detrick’s germ lab, a rudimentary wooden building covered in blacktarpaper and nicknamed the Black Maria [endnotes.xhtml#en0842] by scientists.During the war, an industrial-size boiler, used for fermenting, sat on the lawnoutside the germ lab. Now, given the scope of work planned for the immediatefuture, Detrick needed an aerosol chamber that was bigger and better thananything else like it in the world. The job of designing such a structure wasassigned to a bacteriologist named Dr. Harold Batchelor.Detrick’s British counterparts, at Porton Down, had an excellent chamber oftheir own, but it fit only two or three mice. What Batchelor came up with was amonstrous spherical one-million-liter chamber called the Eight Ball[endnotes.xhtml#en0843], shaped like a giant’s golf ball and held upright byiron “legs.” The Chicago Bridge and Iron Works was commissioned to build theEight Ball to specifications that made it airtight and bombproof. The Eight Ballwas to have portholes, doors, and hatchways and steel walls of one and a halfinches.Inside the Eight Ball, airflow would simulate weather systems, with scientistson the outside controlling temperatures on the inside within a range of 55 to 90degrees Fahrenheit. Humidity could be controlled inside the Eight Ball tofluctuate between 30 and 100 percent. This state-of-the-art environmentalcontrol would allow Detrick’s scientists to understand how aerosolizedbiological agents would work at different altitudes in the open air. The spherewould weigh more than 131 tons and would stand four stories tall. A catwalkaround its center would allow scientists to observe, through portholes, the testsubjects sitting inside as they were exposed to the world’s deadliest germs. TheChicago Bridge and Iron Works agreed to a delivery date of 1949.With the chamber’s design complete, Dr. Batchelor prepared to travel to Germany.There was an important German scientist who was just now becoming available foran interview. This was a man who knew more than almost anyone else in the worldabout biological weapons. He was particularly knowledgeable about weaponizedbubonic plague.The physician was Dr. Kurt Blome, the former deputy surgeon general of the ThirdReich. He had just been acquitted of war crimes at the Nuremberg doctors’ trial.Now he was back on the Paperclip list [endnotes.xhtml#en0844].The doctors’ trial had been over for forty-two days. It was October 2, 1947, anda message from Heidelberg, marked “Secret-Confidential,” [endnotes.xhtml#en0845]arrived on the desk of the chief of the Chemical Corps. It read: “Available nowfor interrogation on biological warfare matters is Doctor Kurt Blome.”A meeting was arranged for November 10, 1947, between Blome and Batchelor.Present alongside Dr. Batchelor were Detrick doctors Dr. Charles R. Phillips, aspecialist in desterilization, Dr. Donald W. Falconer, an explosives expert, andDr. A. W. Gorelick, a dosage expert. Lieutenant R. W. Swanson represented theU.S. Navy and Lieutenant Colonel Warren S. LeRoy represented the army’s EuropeanCommand Headquarters. An interpreter and a stenographer were also present. Dr.Blome was told in advance that everything discussed would be classified[endnotes.xhtml#en0846].Dr. Batchelor spoke first, setting the tone for the all-day affair. “We havecome to interview Dr. Blome personally as well as professionally,” Batchelorsaid. “We have friends in Germany, scientific friends, and this is anopportunity for us to enjoy meeting [Dr. Blome] and to discuss our variousproblems with him.” To begin, Batchelor asked, “Would it be possible for Dr.Blome to give us an overall picture of the information that he has? The natureof the world under discussion?”Blome spoke in English, pausing on occasion for the interpreter to help him witha word. “In 1943 I received orders from Goering for all the research ofBiological Warfare,” Blome explained, “all the research for BW[endnotes.xhtml#en0847] [would fall] under the name Kanserreseach.… CancerResearch had already started long before that, and I was already working all thetime but in order to keep this development secret [the Reich] disguised it.”Dr. Blome laid out the command structure of those involved in biological weaponswork under Himmler, and where the men were now. It was a surprisingly smallgroup of “around twenty” men. As head of the Reich Research Council, Blomeexplained, Göring was at the top, as the Reich’s dictator of science. There werethree men in equal positions directly under Göring, Dr. Blome explained. Blomewas in charge of all research and development of pathogens. Doctors andscientists working in this area reported to him. Major General Dr. WalterSchreiber—the Russians’ surprise witness at Nuremberg and the man who hadpointed the finger at Blome—was in charge of vaccines, antidotes, and serums forbiological weapons. All doctors and scientists working in these areas ultimatelyreported to Schreiber. Finally, Blome explained, Field Marshal Wilhelm Keiteloversaw the Lightning Rod Committee, Blitzableiter, the code name for theordnance experts who worked on delivery systems for biological bombs. Anyoneconducting tests with these kinds of weapons had to go through Keitel.Göring had committed suicide and Keitel had been hanged at Nuremberg after thetrial of the major war criminals. Major General Walter Schreiber was working forthe Russians now. It appeared that Dr. Blome was the last available man standingwith extensive inside knowledge of the Third Reich’s bioweapons program.Dr. Gorelick asked, “Can Dr. Blome give us actual locations of variouslaboratories?”Blome spoke of the Reich’s outpost on the island of Riems[endnotes.xhtml#en0848], a facility that specialized in “Sickness of Cattle”research, including rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease. Blome said thatbecause “the isle was completely isolated except by wire,” it was a perfectplace to conduct this kind of dangerous research. The scientist in charge of thelaboratory was Professor Otto Waldmann and his assistant was Erich Traub “ofinternational fame.” Blome was referring to the fact that before the war, Traubspent several years in America doing research at the Rockefeller Institute, inNew Jersey.Rinderpest was a terrible disease, Blome said. In many ways it was thebiological weapon he feared most. “Germany depended on milk and butter for 60%of her fat resources,” said Blome. “In 1944 it would have resulted in a greatcatastrophe if foot-and-mouth disease had been used against Germany. It wouldhave been the greatest catastrophe ever faced,” according to Blome, “[i]f acountry relies on all its fat resources to get milk and butter. Once the diseasestarts there is no stopping it.” The Detrick scientists were very interested tolearn more.How did the Reich acquire and develop the pathogen, Batchelor asked? Blome hadalready explained this to the Operation Alsos interrogators, but that was twoyears ago, before the doctors’ trial, and apparently these Detrick scientistswere not familiar with what Blome had said when he was at Dustbin. “Byinternational law it was prohibited to have the virus for this sickness inEurope,” Blome said. “The virus was in Turkey and Himmler ordered that for theIsle.” Blome confirmed that Dr. Erich Traub went to Turkey on direct orders fromHimmler and acquired a strain of the dangerous virus there. At Riems, Traub thensucceeded in producing a dry form of the virus. Dry forms were the deadliest ofall, said Blome. “After a period of seven months based on experimentation on theIsle, this virus was still effective. After seven months they still spread andthe cattle were all infected.”Blome then spoke of experimental tests conducted by Luftwaffe pilots in Russia,where the disease was sprayed from low-flying aircraft over fields of grazingcattle.“Positive results,” said Blome.Where were Dr. Traub and Dr. Waldmann now?“I believe that they have been taken prisoner of the Russians and they are stillactive in their research for the Russians,” Blome said.The conversation shifted to plague research at Posen, where Blome had set up aninstitute during the war. “Perhaps we would like to talk about the human angle,”Dr. Phillips asked, trying to veil the uncomfortable subject by using the royal“we.”Dr. Blome had been acquitted of war crimes charges five weeks earlier. Seven ofhis codefendants were to be hanged. Clearly, the subject of experiments onhumans was not something he was going to discuss. The question was rephrased:What did Blome believe was the most groundbreaking biological weapons workconducted by the Reich? Blome said that at Posen, he had been working atdispersing biological agents in a “combination with gas that [a]ffects thethroat. When membranes are hurt [that is, damaged]… bacteria have a betterchance to infect,” Blome said.Dr. Phillips rephrased his question again. Everyone wanted to know about thehuman experiments; it was the ultimate forbidden knowledge the Nazis possessed.“Perhaps we would like to talk about the human angle, which was, I think,Kliewe’s work,” he said.Blome was no fool. “Professor Kliewe has not worked himself with experiments,”Blome said. Heinrich Kliewe performed intelligence work. He was in charge ofkeeping tabs on the biological weapons programs being pursued by nations at warwith the Reich. “Kliewe investigated Polish and Russian sabotage,” Blome said.“The activity here was not to cause an epidemic amongst the population, merelyto kill certain people.”The Detrick doctors were intrigued by this line of conversation and asked Dr.Blome to explain further.During the war, Polish resistance fighters in Posen had succeeded inassassinating “about twenty people,” Blome said, most of whom were SS officers.“A lot of cases of Typhoid,” said Blome. “The waiters in restaurants tookfountain pens filled with the inoculum and injected the inoculum into the soupor the food on their way to and from the dining room. This has been proved.Polish resistance movement was heading all these activities. A German-Polishwoman doctor was working in the hospital and got hold of the bacteria andforwarded it to the other people.”“Were any preventative measures taken?” Dr. Phillips asked.Blome explained that there was an extensive and well-funded Reich researchprogram going on in the field of vaccines, antidotes, and serums—against manypathogens and diseases, from cholera to parrot virus to plague. But Blomeexplained that the holy grail of biological weapons research was the plague. “Ibelieve the only thing of danger to Germany would have been the plague. Becausefor propaganda reasons the plague got more attention tha[n] any others,”[endnotes.xhtml#en0849] Blome added. “People all over the world believe it isthe worst sickness there is.”Dr. Phillips wanted to learn more about the use of “live vaccines” in Blome’splague research.“Schreiber, as the head of the department [endnotes.xhtml#en0850] [epidemics]had very good vaccine material on hand for typhoid, paratyphoid, cholera,diphtheria and Ruhr,” Blome explained. “For the plague, they had serum on handbut the serum was not very powerful, it was very weak. They did not have anyvaccine so I started to build an institute which has never been completed.” Onoccasion, Blome said, he worked in concert with Schreiber’s vaccine researchlaboratory to provide them with “good vaccine material,” meaning the germs.“Which laboratories?” asked Dr. Falconer.“In the Medical Laboratory in Berlin,” said Blome. “There was an officialappointed only for research of epidemics. Prof. Schreiber.”“Was he under Kliewe?” Dr. Phillips asked, apparently still unaware thatProfessor Schreiber was the same Dr. Schreiber who had testified at Nuremberg.If, at Nuremberg, the Russians meant to send a message to American biologicalweapons makers with Schreiber’s testimony, this had gone over the head of thesebacteriologists from Camp Detrick.Blome repeated that Schreiber was “in the same position as I would be underGöring for my cancer researches, so this man was [directly] under Göring.”Meaning Blome and Schreiber were equals in the Reich’s chain of command. Theywere also archenemies. “Schreiber is a Russian PW [prisoner of war] andeverybody who knew Schreiber [endnotes.xhtml#en0851] is convinced he is workingfor them,” said Blome. In this world of intense suspicion, of deviance andtrickery, it was impossible to know who was lying and who was telling the truth.The time came to have a meal. “In closing this particular angle we express ourgratitude to Dr. Blome for his wholehearted cooperation,” Dr. Batchelor said. Hesuggested that they all have dinner together. Pleasant talk. “During that timewe will not discuss this matter,” Batchelor said. As if the Americans had notjust tried to hang Dr. Blome for war crimes. As if Blome had not been ahard-core Nazi ideologue and member of the inner circle, or had not worn theGolden Party Badge. Pleasantries were exchanged and the meeting was adjourned.After the meeting, the Detrick doctors requested from the Army Chemical Corpseverything they knew [endnotes.xhtml#en0852] about Dr. Erich Traub. That Dr.Blome said he was most afraid of an outbreak of cattle plague was serious news.Traub was the world’s leading expert in the disease. Now the U.S. Army wantedhim as their own.Dr. Traub was a virologist, microbiologist, and professor and a doctor ofveterinary medicine. He had been the second in command at the Reich’s StateResearch Institute at Riems since 1942. He was also an expert in Newcastledisease, a contagious bird flu, that he was rumored to have weaponized. TheChemical Corps knew Traub spoke fluent English, that he had dark brown hair,gray-brown eyes, and two pronounced saber scars on his face—on the forehead andupper lip. And they knew that from 1932 until 1938, Traub had been a staffmember at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, in New Jersey. Butafter meeting with Dr. Blome, the Chemical Corps wanted more information onTraub, and they tracked down two of his former American colleagues forinterviews. One of them, Dr. Little, described Traub as a “domineering Germanand a surly type individual with a violent temper.” Another colleague, Dr. JohnNelson, found that despite “long training in the care of animals, [Traub] wentout of his way to be cruel to animals.” This troubled Nelson, who felt that “anyperson who is cruel to animals shows little distinction and difference to histreatment of his fellow human beings.”Before the war, Traub was given the opportunity to stay in America and continuehis research full-time. He chose to return to Germany [endnotes.xhtml#en0853],citing loyalty to the Reich. In 1939, Traub was drafted into the Wehrmacht,Veterinary Corps, and in 1940, he was elevated to captain and fought in thecampaign against France. He was a member of several Nazi organizations,including the Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrerkorps (NSKK), or NationalSocialist Motor Corps; the National Socialist People’s Welfare (NSV); and theReichsluftschutzbund (RLB), or State Air Protection Corps. Dr. Traub’s talentsas a virologist had been identified, and he had been pulled back from the frontlines and assigned to biological weapons work. According to Blome, Traub was themost talented scientist working on anti-animal research—biological weaponsdesigned to kill the animals that a nation relies upon most for food. At the endof the war, when the Riems lab fell to the Russians, with it went Dr. Traub, hiswife, Blanka, and their three children. The laboratory was renamed the LandOffice II for Animal Epidemic Diseases and the Soviets put Traub back to work onbioweapons research. Now, in 1947, the Army began a plan to lure Traub away[endnotes.xhtml#en0854].As for Dr. Blome, the scientists from Detrick knew it was far too risky to offerhim a Paperclip contract just weeks after he’d been acquitted of capital warcrimes at Nuremberg. Drew Pearson’s reporting on the Paperclip contract offeredto Karl Krauch in prison had upset General Eisenhower and nearly brought theprogram to its knees. While Blome made clear his willingness to work for theArmy, the Detrick scientists knew he would have to remain an under-the-radarconsultant, relegated to the JIOA target list for potential hire at a futuredate.The army bacteriologist and biological weapons expert Dr. Harold Batchelorreturned to Camp Detrick with many new ideas to explore, includingassassination-by-poison techniques that had been shared with him by Dr. Blome[endnotes.xhtml#en0855]. The Reich had been researching biological weapons thatwould initiate epidemics but could also “kill certain people,” according toBlome. In 1947, however, with scientific frontiers opening up wide, there wouldbe hundreds of new ways to assassinate individuals using a single devicecarrying a biological or chemical agent. This was an area in which the CIA wasinterested. The Chemical Corps had the perfect scientist for the job ofexploring poisons that could be used for individual assassinations, FritzHoffmann. But Hoffmann had a backlog of work. He still had to figure out how tosynthesize tabun gas so the Chemical Corps could hurry up and begin producing iton an industrial scale."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEEN [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter016]HEADLESS MONSTER [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter016]In June 1948, Colonel Charles E. Loucks, the man who oversaw the Paperclipscientists at Edgewood, was made brigadier general [endnotes.xhtml#en0856] andtransferred to Heidelberg. Loucks now served as chief of intelligence collectionfor Chemical Warfare Plans, European Command. In Heidelberg, he had access to awhole new group of Hitler’s former chemists, from those who had been at the topof the chain of command on down. Within weeks of his arrival, Loucks formed aworking relationship with Richard Kuhn [endnotes.xhtml#en0857], the formerdirector of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg.Because Kuhn had an international profile before and during the war, he was aproblematic candidate for Operation Paperclip. Though Kuhn had once been reveredamong scientists, Samuel Goudsmit of Operation Alsos was never afraid to remindcolleagues that Kuhn had become an active Nazi during the war, and that he beganhis lectures with “Sieg Heil” and the Nazi salute. Kuhn had lied to Goudsmit ina postwar interview, swearing that he had never worked on Reich projects duringthe war. In fact Kuhn was a chemical weapons expert for the Reich and developedsoman nerve agent [endnotes.xhtml#en0858]. Soman was even deadlier than sarinand tabun but considered too delicate and therefore too costly to industrialize.Richard Kuhn began working with General Loucks in Heidelberg on chemical weaponsprojects for the Chemical Corps. General Loucks’s friendly relationship withRichard Kuhn drew ire from the British. When formally queried about hisprofessional partnership with Kuhn, Loucks replied, “I was under the impression[endnotes.xhtml#en0860] that Professor Kuhn had been cleared of his Nazicomplicity [endnotes.xhtml#en0859] or had suffered the penalty and is now in thegood graces of both the British and the Americans.” Further, wrote Loucks, “I amsure our people are certainly familiar with his background.” To General Loucks,moving forward on military programs considered vital to U.S. national securitywas more important than dredging up an individual’s Nazi past. Through the lensof history, this remains one of the most complicated issues regarding OperationPaperclip. When working with ardent Nazis, some American handlers appear to havedeveloped an ability to look the other way. Others, like General Loucks, lookedstraight at the man and saw only the scientist, not the Nazi.Richard Kuhn had a connection with a scientist in Switzerland with whom GeneralLoucks was particularly interested in working. The scientist had beeninvestigating a little-known incapacitating agent that was far more potent thananything the Chemical Corps was working on at the time. This Swiss chemist hadrecently given a lecture, “New Hallucinatory Agent,” to a gathering of the SwissSociety [endnotes.xhtml#en0861] of Psychiatry and the Association of Physiciansin Zurich. On December 16, 1948, General Loucks took a trip to Switzerland. Soas not to draw attention to himself or the U.S. military, he took the unusualstep of taking off his military uniform. This story does not appear in any knowndeclassified army record but is told in Loucks’s own words, in his personaldiaries that were left to the U.S. Army Heritage Center in Pennsylvania. “Wentback to the house [endnotes.xhtml#en0862] and put on civilian clothes,” Louckswrote in his diary. His wife, Pearl, took the plainclothed general to the trainstation. En route to his destination in Switzerland, Loucks shared a compartmentwith a “foreigner, dark, nationality unknown [endnotes.xhtml#en0863],” and a“Dutchman who acted Jewish in quizzing me all about myself.” The traincompartment, Loucks noted, provided a clean, comfortable, well-lit ride, andGeneral Loucks arrived in Bern at 8:55 that night. Before heading to bed, Loucksenjoyed a fire in the fireplace in his hotel room. General Loucks did not notein his journal any of the details of the meeting with the mysterious Swissscientist. The mission was classified.Loucks returned to Germany the following day, and he did note in his journalthat Richard Kuhn came over to his house for lunch with a special guest, Dr.Gerhard Schrader, the inventor of Preparation 9/91, or tabun gas. With snowcoming down outside the Louckses’ home in flurries, Richard Kuhn, Dr. GerhardSchrader, and General Loucks had a pleasant chat and “lunch of pork chops[endnotes.xhtml#en0864].”Decades later, in a speech prepared for the Amherst chapter of the Daughters ofthe American Revolution and the Sons of the American Revolution, General Loucksrevealed that this Swiss chemist referred to him by Richard Kuhn had beenProfessor Werner Stoll, a psychiatric researcher at the University of Zurich.The hallucinatory agent that Loucks was after in Switzerland would be theultimate “incapacitation chemical” also sought by L. Wilson Greene at Edgewood“to knock out not kill.” The chemical, said Loucks, was called “Lysergic AcidDiethylamide [endnotes.xhtml#en0865],” or LSD. Stoll did not discover LSD. Thatdistinction went to Albert Hofmann, a chemist for Sandoz pharmaceutical companyin Basel. Werner Stoll, a colleague of Hoffmann’s (and the son of Sandoz chiefchemist, Arthur Stoll), repeated Albert Hofmann’s original LSD experiment andconcluded, “modified LSD-25 was a psychotropic compound that was nontoxic andcould have enormous use as a psychiatric aid [endnotes.xhtml#en0866].” In 1947,Werner Stoll had published the first article on LSD [endnotes.xhtml#en0867], inthe Swiss Archives of Neurology. Stoll’s second paper, entitled “A NewHallucinatory Agent, Active in Very Small Amounts,” was published two yearslater, in 1949. But General Loucks did not see LSD as a psychiatric aid butrather as a weapon, an incapacitating agent with enormous potential on thebattlefield. Soon the army and the navy would all be experimenting with LSD as aweapon, and the CIA would be experimenting with LSD as a means of controllinghuman behavior, an endeavor that soon came to be known as mind control.Eventually, physicians and chemists from Operation Paperclip[endnotes.xhtml#en0868] would work on jointly operated classified programscode-named Chatter, Bluebird, Artichoke, MKUltra, and others. LSD, the drug thatinduces paranoia and unpredictability and makes people see things that are notreally there, would become a strange allegory for the Cold War.One day in the late summer of 1948 a call came in to Brigadier General CharlesLoucks’s new office in Heidelberg. A lieutenant answered the phone. The caller,a German, left a cryptic message to be relayed to General Loucks. It was shortand to the point.“I can help, [endnotes.xhtml#en0869]” the caller said.He left a return telephone number and his name, Schieber. General Loucks hadbeen in Germany since June. As chief of intelligence collection for chemicalwarfare plans in Europe, it was Loucks’s job to determine which Western Europeancountries were developing chemical weapons and to monitor their progress. Louckswas also working on unfinished business back at Edgewood, namely, the continuingfailure by the Chemical Corps to develop industrial-scale production of nervegas, an effort that by now had officially switched from the pursuit of tabun tothe pursuit of sarin. The American university professors Loucks had hired backin the U.S. were making very little progress. “We put samples [of sarin] infront of them [endnotes.xhtml#en0870] and everything, but yet they… could notcome up with any process to make some Sarin,” General Loucks explained decadeslater in an oral history for the U.S. Army. A fire in the sarin plant atEdgewood had set the program back even further.Along came the Schieber call.In 1947, a thick OMGUS security report had been compiled on SS-Brigadeführer Dr.Walter Schieber. He had been involved with the U.S. Army since the fall of theReich.Schieber was a Nazi Bonzen, a big wheel. He was unattractive, fat, and wore aHitler mustache and false teeth [endnotes.xhtml#en0871]. Since the 1920s he hadbeen regarded as one of Hitler’s Alte Kämpfer, the Old Fighters, trusted membersof Hitler’s inner circle [endnotes.xhtml#en0872] who wore the Golden PartyBadge. Dr. Schieber was also a loyal SS man and served on the personal staff ofHeinrich Himmler [endnotes.xhtml#en0873].SS-Brigadeführer Dr. Walter Schieber had been a dedicated and loyal member ofthe Nazi Party since 1931. He had also been frequently photographed alongsideHitler, Himmler, Bormann, and Speer as part of the inner circle. A number ofthese photographs survived the war, which made public dealings with Schieberimpossible. U.S. Army transactions with him were classified Top Secret. As headof the Reich Ministry of Armaments Supply Office (Rüstungslieferungsamt), firstunder Fritz Todt when the ministry was called the Munitions Ministry, orOrganisation Todt, and then under Albert Speer, Schieber was an engineer and achemist [endnotes.xhtml#en0874] and handled business in both areas for the ThirdReich. As an engineer, he oversaw many of the Reich’s underground engineeringprojects. “Designs for concentration camp [endnotes.xhtml#en0875] armamentsfactories remained almost the exclusive work of Schieber,” writes Michael ThadAllen, an expert on the SS and slave labor.Schieber also wore his chemist’s hat for at least one concentration campexperiment. In an attempt to save the SS money and address the growing problemof food shortages among slave laborers, Schieber designed a “nourishment”program [endnotes.xhtml#en0876] called Eastern Nutrition (Östliche Kostform). Itwas tested at the Mauthausen concentration camp. For a period of six months,starting in December 1943, a group of one hundred and fifty slave laborers weredenied the watery broth they usually received and instead were fed an artificialpaste designed by Schieber and made up of cellulose remnants, or pieces of usedclothing. One hundred and sixteen of the one hundred and fifty test subjectsdied. After the war, there was a judicial inquiry into Schieber’s EasternNutrition program. The West German courts determined that the resulting deathscould not necessarily be “attributed to nutrition” because there were so manyother causes of death in the concentration camp.Walter Schieber was further linked to the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands,of slave laborers through the various chemical weapons programs that werecarried out at Farben’s multiple production plants. Schieber was not tried atNuremberg but was used as a witness for the prosecution instead. During the war,with his expertise as a chemist, SS-Brigadeführer Dr. Walter Schieber was theSpeer ministry’s liaison to IG Farben and he oversaw the industrial productionof tabun and sarin gas. According to his intelligence file, one of his titleswas “confidential clerk of IG Farben [endnotes.xhtml#en0877] AG.” Dr. WalterSchieber and Dr. Otto Ambros worked together at the Dyhernfurth nerve agentproduction facility.By the late summer of 1948, Otto Ambros had been tried and convicted atNuremberg and was serving an eight-year sentence at Landsberg Prison for massmurder and slavery. Schieber had been released from his obligations as a witnessfor the tribunal and was a free man. Now, here he was on the telephone,requesting to speak with Brigadier General Loucks. Schieber was looking for workwith the U.S. Army Chemical Corps.“I’m free now [endnotes.xhtml#en0878],” Schieber told Loucks’s lieutenant duringthe call. “They have nothing against me.”It was, of course, more complicated than that.Four months prior, in February 1948, former SS-Brigadeführer Walter Schieber hadsigned a Top Secret Operation Paperclip contract [endnotes.xhtml#en0879] withthe JIOA. He had been recruited by Colonel Putt at Wright Field, nowWright-Patterson Air Force Base. Putt wanted to make use of Schieber’sunderground engineering skills—just as Georg Rickhey’s skills had been usedbefore Rickhey was returned to Germany to stand trial for war crimes. Hiring atop Nazi like Walter Schieber was risky, and the potential problems facing theU.S. Air Force for doing so were candidly discussed in an exchange ofmemorandums. A JIOA case officer wrote to military headquarters in Frankfurtsummarizing how things were progressing. “Subject is Dr. Walter Schieber[endnotes.xhtml#en0880]… requested priority shipment to Wright Field. Schieber’sability is outstanding and his potentialities believed invaluable to the UnitedStates.” For the past three months, the case officer explained, Schieber hadbeen working on “the underground factory project,” a massive undertaking, atU.S. military headquarters in Germany. The project was spearheaded by FranzDorsch, and Schieber had been working as Dorsch’s first assistant. In Germany,Schieber and Dorsch had supervised “150 scientists and technicians” who hadbuilt underground factories for the Reich. The result was a thousand-pagemonograph for U.S. Air Force. Schieber, the report explained, “has beenespecially cooperative and is agreeable to going to [the] United States. He iswell known to the Soviets and is desired by them. His exploitation in the UnitedStates is therefore believed highly desirable.”There was, however, a problem that needed to be addressed, wrote the caseofficer. “His party record is as follows: Entered party in June 31, BrigadeFuhrer in the SS, holder of the Golden Party Badge, member of SS, DAF [DeutscheArbeitsfront, or German Labor Front], NSV [NationalsozialistischeVolkswohlfahrt, or National Socialist People’s Welfare], and VDCH [VDCh, orAssociation of German Chemists].” There was no way to disguise that Schieber hadbeen in Hitler’s inner circle, but the JIOA also proposed a solution. “In orderto minimize the possibility of unfavorable publicity in the United States yourviews requested on advisability of shipping subject via air under escort[endnotes.xhtml#en0881] and or under an alias.” Schieber could be part ofOperation Paperclip as long as no one knew who Schieber really was. Unlikestandard operating procedure with Operation Paperclip applicants, there was tobe no photograph of SS-Brigadeführer Dr. Walter Schieber attached to hisintelligence file.The air force agreed with JIOA’s suggestions. “Ship Dr. Walter Schieber toWright Field [endnotes.xhtml#en0882] Dayton Ohio. Air Force requests case beexpedited and given top priority.” There was one caveat that JIOA and the airforce agreed upon. Dr. Schieber had to undergo a denazification trial first.“Trusting he would be placed [endnotes.xhtml#en0883] in Class 3”—the categoryfor individuals who were “less incriminated”—after his denazification trial, Dr.Walter Schieber packed his bags and awaited transport to the United States.Instead, on March 11, 1948, a different verdict came in: “the civilian InterneeDr. Walter Schieber, born 13-09-1897 at Beimerstetten, former Chief of ArmamentsDeliveries on the Reich Ministry for Armaments and War Production, Head of theCentral Office for Generators, Deputy Head of the Reich Organization Industry,SS-Brigadefueher [sic], PSt [presently] held at this enclosure,” read thedecree, “was tried by the Sonder-Spruchkammer for Hesse, Neustadt-Lager, andsentenced to Group II, 2 years Labor Camp and restriction to 5 years ordinarylabor.” The Group 2 designation meant that Schieber was in a category with“party activists, militarists, and profiteers.” His Paperclip contract wouldhave to wait.Five days after his trial, Schieber contacted the U.S. Army Counter IntelligenceCorps to relay to his Paperclip handler his version of events. “Herr Berbeth[the judge] had subject brought into the chamber and asked him about his trip tothe United States, to which Schieber replied that he did not think it would bewise for him to go to the U.S. as an offender. Herr Berbeth suggested that heshould immediately apply for a re-trial or ask the Minister for PoliticalLiberation for a pardon. Herr Berbeth also told Schieber that he would recommendsuch a pardon.” Schieber told his Paperclip handler [endnotes.xhtml#en0884]that, after leaving the courtroom, he had returned to the internee camp where hewas being held. Then, according to Schieber, something rather shocking happened:“Berbeth of the court joined Schieber and told him, contrary to his previousstatement, not to apply for another trial or a pardon, but to go to Frankfurtimmediately, contact the Russian Liaison Officer and ask for an Interzonal Pass.With this pass, subject [Schieber] was to enter the Russian Zone and proceed toone of his factories in the Schwarza/Saale [where] he could be assured of everypossible help, should he have the desire to work in his former position.” Inother words, according to Schieber, the judge at this trial worked for theRussians and was offering him a job. Schieber claimed to have told the judgethat his offer sounded impossible. Was he really being advised to ignore thecourt’s judgment, to flee the camp, get an interzonal pass, and begin workingfor the Russians “at a high pay grade” comparable to what he was paid during theHitler regime? “The President of the Spruchkammer assured [me] that arrangementswould be made,” Schieber said. Did this really happen? Was the judge a Russianmole? Or was Schieber playing the Americans with the proverbial Russian card?Schieber’s Counter Intelligence Corps handler asked him what he thought of thejudge’s black market offer. “Schieber believes that [endnotes.xhtml#en0885] the[Spruchkammern] sentence was imposed to prevent his contract with the UnitedStates and to make his residence in Germany so difficult as to force him toaccept the Russian Offers.” The handler had his own thoughts. “Cancellation ofSchiebers [sic] contract after he has possibly jeopardized his safety and afterhe has cooperated so whole-heartedly with intelligence agencies here is certainto have an adverse effect on the future contracting or exploitation ofspecialists and will only serve as another example of broken faith on the partof the United States.” The CIC officer felt that when “considering the magnitudeof Schiebers [sic] potential value to the United States either for military orcivil exploitation,” it was obvious that his contract needed to be honored oneway or other. The officer recommended that Schieber be paid as a consultant tothe U.S. Army in Heidelberg. In the meantime, he could appeal the judgment ofthe Spruchkammern trial and become part of Operation Paperclip after theattention died down.The air force had already soured on Schieber. At the Pentagon, his case had beenreviewed again. The air force now saw Schieber’s Nazi Party history in a whollydifferent light. In their eyes, Schieber had transformed from a brilliantengineer to a ruthless, greedy war profiteer. “Walther Schieber started hisbusiness career [endnotes.xhtml#en0886] at the Gustloff Werke in Weimar, acombine owned by the Nazi Party and comprising five industrial corporations,”read the air force response. “He soon became the leader in the German Celluloseand Rayon Ring, which was the second largest fiber combine in Germany. Hefounded Thuringische Zellwolle A.G. in Schwarza and subsequently gained controlof the French Synthetic Fiber combine,” meaning that with the help of SSofficers, Schieber had confiscated Jewish-owned businesses in France and madethem the property of the Third Reich. Synthetic fibers were imperative to theReich, used for everything from soldiers’ uniforms to blankets to parachutes.Photographs of Schieber displaying bolts of synthetic cloth to Hitler, Himmler,and Bormann show all parties smiling with pride.“Schieber was appointed by Speer to the position of Chief of the Office forDelivery of Armament Goods in the Ministry for Armaments and Munitions and wasnamed deputy leader of the National Group Industry by [Walter] Funk,” read theair force report. How he went from dealing fabrics to weapons productionremained unclear, but his ambition had to have come into play. “Described as atop-ranking figure in the Nazi war economy, he is said to have constantlyprofited from being a party man [endnotes.xhtml#en0887],” noted the air force.There was only one conclusion: “Cancel Air Force request [endnotes.xhtml#en0888]for Walter Schieber. Subject considered ineligible Paperclip.”United States European Command (EUCOM) headquarters in Frankfurt—variouscommands had different headquarters—cabled the JIOA office at the Pentagon tolet them know that cancellation of the request was an unsound idea: “It isbelieved here that these considerations outweigh the risk of possible criticismof his being sent to the United States, and if necessary, warrant an exceptionto present policy [endnotes.xhtml#en0889]. Further, it is considered advisablethat for Schieber’s future personal safety and for intelligence reasons, he notbe present… when and if official action against him occurs. Therefore it isstrongly recommended that reconsideration be given the decision to cancelSchieber’s contract and that he be sent to the United States regardless of theoutcome of his appeal.” EUCOM wanted Schieber moved out of Germany and sent tothe United States—now. Nothing happened for three months—until Brigadier GeneralCharles Loucks arrived in Heidelberg.After the second Schieber call came in to General Loucks’s office, Loucks toldhis lieutenant to set up a meeting [endnotes.xhtml#en0890] with the man. As of2013, their official meeting remains classified. But General Loucks wroteregularly in his desk diary, which fills in what the declassified OperationPaperclip case file on Schieber leaves out. On October 14, 1948, Dr. Schieberwas invited to attend a roundtable conference at Army Chemical Corpsheadquarters in Heidelberg. “Classified matters [endnotes.xhtml#en0891]” werediscussed, Loucks penned in his journal that night. Schieber told Loucks he hadbeen in on the Reich’s manufacturing of nerve gas “from the beginning.” Heappealed to General Loucks’s patriotic side. “I want you to know that if thereis anything I can do to help the West I shall do it,” Schieber said. Loucksliked Schieber’s willingness to help the cause so much that he invited Schieberto join him at his house for a drink.That evening Loucks recorded his thoughts [endnotes.xhtml#en0892]: “Attendedconf. with… Dr. Walter Schieber—classified matters. No particular info but hopefor more later, possibly when better acquainted. I’ll try to see him next timehe reports in to Div. of Intell. He directed the production of war gases on arather high echelon so doesn’t have the detailed knowledge that I want, butpossibly I can get the names of useful people from him. Took him to the housefor a drink.”Chemical weapons, like biological weapons, were perceived by some to be “dirtybusiness,” as President Roosevelt once said. But to men like General Loucks andWalter Schieber, to advance a nation’s arsenal of chemical weapons was achallenging and necessary job. It “was more interesting [endnotes.xhtml#en0893]than going down to Paris on weekends,” Loucks wrote in his journal.General Loucks asked to meet with Dr. Schieber again, this time to ask Schieberif he could assist with a “problem” the U.S. Army was having producing saringas. Schieber was happy to help. He told Loucks that during the war it was theFarben chemists who had produced sarin gas and that he knew all these chemistsvery well. They were his friends. “They worked with me during the war,” Schieberexplained.“We wouldn’t expect you to do this for free,” Loucks told Schieber, meaningprovide the U.S. Chemical Corps with secrets. The two men arranged to meet againin the following weeks.On October 28, 1948, Loucks and his wife, Pearl, hosted a dinner party in theirhome. Again, Schieber was a guest. Loucks had by now taken an extraordinaryliking to Dr. Schieber and wrote his impressions of the man in his diary thatnight. “Schieber is interesting [endnotes.xhtml#en0894]—an independent thinking,intelligent and very competent man. He related much of his experience with theRussians. A prisoner of war after the 1st World War for a year. He was anhonorary (?) Brigade Fuehrer of SS this last war. In confinement in Nurembergfor seven months. Quartered next to Goering until the latter killed himself. Wasan admirer of Todt, later worked for Speer, was directed to report to Hitlerfrequently. He has many anecdotes and is a loyal German. Is willing to doanything for the future of the world and Germany.” Why was General Loucks sowilling to overlook SS-Brigadeführer Dr. Walter Schieber’s criminal past and hiscentral role inside the Third Reich? A story that Charles Loucks told an armyhistorian decades later sheds light on this question.At the end of World War II, after the Japanese surrendered, Colonel Loucks wentto Tokyo, where he served as the chief chemical officer for the U.S. Army.Sometimes Loucks took day trips into the countryside. In the last five months ofwar in Japan, American bombers conducted a massive incendiary bombing campaignagainst sixty-seven Japanese cities that killed nearly a million citizens, mostof whom burned to death. Still, the Japanese refused to surrender, and it tooktwo atomic bombs to end the war. The incendiary bombs dropped on thosesixty-seven cities were produced at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal. Colonel Loucksoversaw the production of tens of thousands of them. In Japan, after thefighting was over, and when Loucks took day trips, he often brought his cameraalong and took photographs of the landscape, the damage, and the dead. WhenLoucks returned home to America, he compiled these photographs into an album ofmore than one hundred black-and-white snapshots. One photograph in the album[endnotes.xhtml#en0895], which is archived at the U.S. Army Heritage Center inPennsylvania, shows Colonel Loucks standing next to an enormous pile of deadbodies.Years later Colonel Loucks explained to the army historian what the photographmeant to him. “Driving one day in a Jeep [endnotes.xhtml#en0896] from Yokohamato Tokyo, I stopped along the side of a road. The incendiary attacks had donetheir work,” Loucks explained. The area “was all burned out; a wasteland all theway through. We dropped tens of thousands of them [incendiary bombs] on thewhole area between Yokohama and Tokyo.”Out there in the Japanese countryside, said Loucks, “I noticed a great stack ofincendiary bombs—small ones. I went over to take a look at them. They lookedlike something that we had made at Rocky Mountain. Sure enough, they were. Herein one place they had a great stack of them. They were burned out but the bodieswere still there because they didn’t burn. They stacked them up in this big highpile. I had a picture of me standing beside them, because I had been responsiblefor the manufacturing of them. That was just one of those incidents that didn’tmean anything [endnotes.xhtml#en0897], but I just happened to see what hadhappened to some of our incendiary bombs that were over there.”In describing the photograph—an enormous pile of dead bodies next to a stack ofincendiary bombs—Colonel Loucks expressed a peculiar kind of detachment. To thearmy historian interviewing him, Loucks made clear that what interested him inthe photograph was noting the effectiveness—or in this case ineffectiveness—ofthe bombs he had been responsible for manufacturing. Similarly, Loucks expresseddetachment as far as Dr. Schieber was concerned, as evidenced in his journalentries. It was as if Loucks could not, or would not, see Schieber in thecontext of the millions of Jews murdered on the direct orders of Schieber’sclosest wartime colleagues. What interested Loucks about Schieber was what aneffective chemical weapons maker he was.During the next meeting between General Loucks and Dr. Schieber, Loucks got veryspecific with Schieber in terms of what he was after. “Could you develop theprocess [endnotes.xhtml#en0898] and put it on paper with drawings,specifications and tables and safety regulations to make Sarin?” Loucks asked,as noted in his desk diary.“Yes, I could do that,” Schieber said.Loucks recalled the next conversation [endnotes.xhtml#en0899] the two men had.“He said they had a big works outside of Berlin that was just completed when thewar was over and made little token amounts but no production. When [the Reich]announced that the Russians were taking over, those engineers and chemists bothcame West into the American and British occupied zones.” Schieber was lying toGeneral Loucks. The nerve gas production plant outside Berlin to which Schieberreferred was Falkenhagen, and it was run by Otto Ambros’s deputy and the man whohad stashed the steel drum outside Gendorf, Jürgen von Klenck. By war’s end, thefactory at Falkenhagen had produced more than five hundred tons of sarin gas,hardly “little token amounts,” as Schieber claimed. If Loucks had read vonKlenck’s OMGUS security report, or any of the CIOS reports written by MajorEdmund Tilley, he would have learned that Schieber was lying to him. Instead,General Loucks asked Schieber if he could locate these chemists who knew so muchabout sarin production and bring them to Heidelberg. He held out to Schieber thepromise of a U.S. Army contract. Further, “We will pay all their [the chemists’]expenses [endnotes.xhtml#en0900] and give them something for their work,” Louckssaid.“Yes, I can do that.” Schieber replied. He said that he knew all of the Farbenchemists and could easily get them to tell the Americans everything. He listedtheir names for Loucks. One of the six Farben chemists on the list was Ambros’sdeputy and the man who ran Falkenhagen, Jürgen von Klenck.On October 29, 1948, Colonel Loucks wrote a memorandum to the chief of the ArmyChemical Corps [endnotes.xhtml#en0901]. The best, fastest way to get Germantechnical information on tabun and sarin gas was to hire Dr. Schieber, ColonelLoucks advised. In his diary, Loucks wrote, “Hope the chief will support us[endnotes.xhtml#en0902]. If he does, we’ll be able to get all of the German CWtechnical ability on our side and promptly. They know on what side they belong.All we need to do is treat them as human beings. They recognize the militarydefeat and the political and ideological defeat as well and accept it.”One week later, General Loucks told Schieber that he had been authorized to payhim 1,000 marks a month for consulting work. Schieber gave Loucks the contactinformation for the six chemists and technicians who would join him in hisefforts to explain precisely how to produce sarin gas. On December 11, 1948,Loucks hosted the first roundtable meeting of Hitler’s chemists in hisHeidelberg home, secrecy assured. For the next three months, the chemists metevery other Saturday at Loucks’s home. There, they created detailed,step-by-step reports on how to produce industrial amounts of sarin gas[endnotes.xhtml#en0903]. They drew charts and graphs and made lists of materialsand equipment required. Years later, Loucks reflected, “One of the team[endnotes.xhtml#en0904] [members] was a young engineer who had an excellentcommand of English which helped greatly and was his major contribution [and thatwas] Jurgend [sic] von Klenck.”When the work was finally compiled and sent to Edgewood, the results were theperfect recipe for the deadly nerve agent. According to General Loucks, withoutHitler’s chemists, the American program had been a failure. With them, it was asuccess. “That’s when we built the plant [endnotes.xhtml#en0905] out in RockyMountain Arsenal,” Loucks explained. The incendiary bombs that Colonel Loucksoversaw at Rocky Mountain Arsenal during World War II would now be replaced byM34 cluster bombs filled with sarin gas. The Top Secret program was code-namedGibbett-Delivery [endnotes.xhtml#en0906].A friendship between two brigadier generals, Loucks and Schieber, had beensolidified. The following summer, Schieber sent Loucks a thank-you note and agift, not identified in the records but described by Schieber as a piece of“equipment… that once stood at the beginning of the same work group.” Theunknown item [endnotes.xhtml#en0907] had been used by Schieber during the Naziera, when sarin gas was first developed for Hitler. Over the next eight yearsthe two brigadier generals exchanged Christmas cards [endnotes.xhtml#en0908].In January 1950, General Loucks was called to Washington, D.C., for severalmeetings at the Pentagon. According to Loucks’s desk diary, during his firstmeeting there he was reprimanded by a Pentagon official for cultivating friendlyrelationships with Hitler’s chemists.“ ‘I don’t like this, [endnotes.xhtml#en0909]” Loucks wrote that his superiorhad informed him. “ ‘I don’t want to be made a fool of over this. Everyone seemsto have cut them [the Nazis] off their list. To be friendly with them seems badform.’ ”But General Loucks noted in his diary that he had every intention of defyingthis superior’s request. He had become good friends with the German chemists. Heregularly had meals with Walter Schieber and Richard Kuhn, and, on at least oneoccasion, Schieber had spent the night [endnotes.xhtml#en0910] at Loucks’shouse. “I’ll see them anyhow,” he wrote, in a diary entry dated February 1,1950. The following day, Loucks was called back in to the Pentagon. “Went toPentagon,” he wrote, “long session with H.Q. Int. [endnotes.xhtml#en0911][headquarters, intelligence] people… seemed interested in what we are doing [inHeidelberg]—would give me money necessary to exploit the Germans for scientificand technical intelligence.” In other words, what some at the Pentagon refusedto condone, others were willing to support through covert means.General Loucks’s secret Saturday roundtable at his house in Heidelberg with theNazi chemists remained hidden from the public for six decades. Here was abrigadier general with the U.S. Army doing business with a former brigadiergeneral of the Third Reich allegedly in the interests of the United States. Itwas a Cold War black program that was paid for by the U.S. Army but did notofficially exist. There were no checks and no balances. Operation Paperclip wasbecoming a headless monster.The CIA’s working relationship with the JIOA and Operation Paperclip had begunwithin a few months of the Agency’s creation. Within the CIA, Paperclip[endnotes.xhtml#en0912] was managed inside the Office of Collection andDissemination, and one of the first things requested by its administrator, L. T.Shannon, was “a photostatted copy [endnotes.xhtml#en0913] of a set of filescompiled by Dr. Werner Osenberg and consisting of biographical records ofapproximately 18,000 German scientists.” By the winter of 1948, hundreds ofmemos were going back and forth between the JIOA and the CIA. Sometimes the CIAwould request information from the JIOA on certain scientists, and sometimes theJIOA would ask the CIA to provide it with intelligence on a specific scientistor group of scientists.Also in the first three months of the CIA’s existence, the National SecurityCouncil issued Directive No. 3, dealing specifically with the “production ofintelligence [endnotes.xhtml#en0914] and the coordination of intelligenceproduction activities within the intelligence community.” The National SecurityCouncil wanted to know who was producing what intelligence and how thatinformation was being coordinated among agencies. In the opinion of the CIA,“the link between scientific planning and military research on a national scaledid not hitherto exist.” The result was the creation of the ScientificIntelligence Committee (SIC), chaired by the CIA and with members from the army,the navy, the air force, the State Department, and the Atomic Energy Commission.“Very early in its existence the SIC undertook to define scientificintelligence, delineate areas of particular interest and establish committees tohandle these areas,” wrote SIC chairman Dr. Karl Weber, in a CIA monograph thatremained classified until September 2008. “Priority was accorded[endnotes.xhtml#en0915] to atomic energy, biological warfare, chemical warfare,electronic warfare, guided missiles, aircraft, undersea warfare andmedicine”—every area involving Operation Paperclip scientists. Eight scientificintelligence subcommittees were created, one for each area of warfare.Despite the urgency, the JIOA’s plan to make Operation Paperclip over into along-term program was still at a standstill. By the spring of 1948, half of theone thousand German scientists [endnotes.xhtml#en0916] bound for America hadarrived, but not a single one of them had a visa. Troublemaker Samuel Klaus wasgone from the State Department, but the JIOA could still not get the visadivision to make things happen fast enough. On May 11, 1948, militaryintelligence chief General Stephen J. Chamberlin, the man who had briefedEisenhower in 1947, took matters into his own hands. Chamberlin went to meet FBIdirector J. Edgar Hoover to enlist his help with visas. Cold War paranoia was onthe rise, and both men were staunch anti-Communists. The success of OperationPaperclip, said Chamberlin, was essential to national security. The FBI had theCommunists to fear, not the Nazis. Hoover agreed. Paperclip recruits needed thepromise of American citizenship now more than ever, Chamberlin said, before anymore of them were stolen away by the Russians. Chamberlin asked Hoover to putpressure on the State Department. J. Edgar Hoover said he would see what hecould do. What, if anything, Hoover did remains a mystery. Three months later,the first seven scientists had U.S. immigrant visas. Now it was time to put thetransition process to the test.For Operation Paperclip, moving a scientist from military custody[endnotes.xhtml#en0917] to immigrant status required elaborate and deviouspreparation, but in the end the procedure proved to be infallible. Scientists inthe southwestern or western United States, accompanied by military escort, weredriven in an unmarked army jeep out of the country into Mexico either at NuevoLaredo, Ciudad Juárez, or Tijuana. With him, each scientist carried two formsfrom the State Department, I-55 and I-255, each bearing a signature from thechief of the visa division and a proviso from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Section42.323 of Title 22, signifying that the visa holder was “a person whoseadmission is highly desirable in the national interest.” The scientist also hadwith him a photograph of himself and a blood test warranting that he did nothave any infectious diseases. After consulate approval, the scientist was thenlet back into the United States, no longer under military guard but as a legalU.S. immigrant in possession of a legal visa. The pathway toward citizenship hadbegun. If the scientist lived closer to the East Coast than the West Coast, hewent through the same protocols, except that he would exit the United Statesinto Canada instead of Mexico and reenter through the consulate at NiagaraFalls.It was an international crisis in June of 1948 that finally gave OperationPaperclip its long-term momentum. Early on the morning of June 24, the Sovietscut off all land and rail access to the American zone in Berlin. This actionwould become known as the Berlin Blockade, and it was seen as one of the firstmajor international crises of the Cold War. “The Soviet blockade of Berlin in1948 clearly indicated that the wartime alliance [between the Soviets and theUnited States] had dissolved,” explained CIA deputy director for operations JackDowning. “Germany then became a new battlefield [endnotes.xhtml#en0918] betweeneast and west.” The CIA presence in Germany was redoubled as its plans forcovert action [endnotes.xhtml#en0919] against the Soviets shifted into highgear. The CIA needed to hire thousands of foreign nationals living in Germany tohelp in this effort—spies, saboteurs, and scientists—many of whom had spent timein displaced-persons camps [endnotes.xhtml#en0920] and interrogation facilitiesoperated by the U.S. Army in the American zone of occupied Germany. Initially,the CIA and the JIOA worked hand in glove inside Germany to thwart Sovietthreats, but soon the two agencies would start competing for German scientistsand spies.The two agencies worked together inside a clandestine intelligence facility inthe American zone informally called Camp King. The activities there between 1946and the late 1950s have never been fully accounted for by either the Departmentof Defense or the CIA. Camp King was strategically located[endnotes.xhtml#en0921] in the village of Oberursel, just eleven miles northwestof the United States European Command (EUCOM) headquarters in Frankfurt.Officially the facility had two other names [endnotes.xhtml#en0922]: the U.S.Military Intelligence Service Center at Oberursel and the 7707th EuropeanCommand Intelligence Center. A small plaque in a park outside the officers’ clubexplained to visitors the significance of the informal name[endnotes.xhtml#en0923]. Colonel Charles B. King, an intelligence officer, hadbeen in the process of accepting the surrender of a group of Nazis on Utah Beachin June 1944 when he was double-crossed and slain by a “strong and concentratedbarrage of enemy artillery fire.” There was tragic irony in the name. Camp Kinghad become home to many well-intentioned American officers trying to make dealswith untrustworthy enemies. Many of these American officers would bedouble-crossed and at least one of them would be killed.A lot had changed at Camp King since John Dolibois had personally delivered sixNazi Bonzen here in August 1945. The interrogation facility had become one ofthe most clandestine U.S. intelligence centers in Western Europe, and for morethan a decade it would function as a Cold War black site long before black siteswere known as such. Camp King was a joint interrogation center and theintelligence agencies that shared access to prisoners here included ArmyIntelligence, Air Force Intelligence, Naval Intelligence, and the CIA. By 1948,most of its prisoners were Soviet-bloc spies [endnotes.xhtml#en0924].How the CIA used Camp King remains one of the Agency’s most closely guardedsecrets. It was here in Oberursel that the CIA first began developing “extremeinterrogation” techniques and “behavior modification programs” under the codenames Operation Bluebird and Operation Artichoke [endnotes.xhtml#en0925]. Theunorthodox methods the CIA and its partner agencies explored included hypnosis,electric shock, chemicals, and illegal street drugs. Camp King was chosen as anideal place to do this work in part because it was “off-site” but mainly becauseof its access to prisoners believed to be Soviet spies.When the Americans captured the facility in the spring of 1945, the Nazis hadbeen using it as an interrogation facility for Allied fliers. Camp King’s firstcommanding officer [endnotes.xhtml#en0926] was Colonel William Russell Philp,and through the fall of 1945, Philp shared the Military Intelligence ServiceCenter at Oberursel with General William J. Donovan, founding director of theOffice of Strategic Services. General Donovan oversaw an operation here wherebyhigh-ranking Nazi generals, including those dropped off by John Dolibois, werepaid to write intelligence reports on subjects [endnotes.xhtml#en0927] likeGerman order of battle and Nazi Party chain of command. Dolibois, fluent inGerman, acted as Donovan’s liaison to the Nazi prisoners during this time.General Donovan kept an office at Oberursel until the OSS was disbanded inSeptember 1945, after which he returned to Washington, D.C., and civilian life.Colonel Philp’s job was to handle the rest of the prisoners. In the months thatfollowed war’s end, the Camp King prisoner population grew to include Russiandefectors and captured Soviet spies. There was valuable intelligence to begained from these individuals, Philp learned, willingly or through coercion. ButPhilp also found that his officers lacked a greater context[endnotes.xhtml#en0928] within which to interpret the raw intelligence beinggathered from the Soviets. Russia had been America’s ally during the war. Now itwas the enemy. The Soviets were masters of disinformation. Who was telling thetruth? The Nazi prisoners claimed to know, and Colonel Philp began using severalof them to interpret and analyze information from Soviet defectors[endnotes.xhtml#en0929]. These Nazis were “experts in espionage against theRussians,” Philp later said. Two of them seemed particularly knowledgeable:Gerhard Wessel, who had been an officer in the German intelligence organizationAbwehr, and Wessel’s deputy, Hermann Baun. Philp put the men to work. Whatstarted out as a “research project using POWs” became a “gradual drift intooperations [endnotes.xhtml#en0930],” said Philp. He moved the Nazis into a safehouse on the outskirts of Camp King, code-named Haus Blue, where they oversawcounterintelligence operations against the Soviets under the code name ProjectKeystone. Philp found that working with Nazis was a slippery slope, and in amatter of months the Germans had transformed from prisoners to paid intelligenceassets of the U.S. Army.In the summer of 1946 a major event occurred that influenced the CIA’s futurerole in Operation Paperclip and Camp King. Major General Reinhard Gehlen, formerhead of the Nazis’ intelligence operation against the Soviets, arrived at CampKing. Gehlen had been in the United States under interrogation since 1945. Hereat Oberursel, Army Intelligence decided to make Gehlen head[endnotes.xhtml#en0931] of its entire “anti-Communist intelligenceorganization,” under the code name Operation Rusty. Eventually the organizationwould become known simply as the Gehlen Organization. A network of former Naziintelligence agents, the majority of whom were members of the SS, began workingout of offices at Camp King side by side with army intelligence officers.Colonel Philp was in charge of overall supervision. By late 1947, the GehlenOrganization had gotten so large it required its own headquarters. Armyintelligence moved the organization to a self-contained facility outside Munich,in a village called Pullach [endnotes.xhtml#en0932]. This compound was theformer estate of Martin Bormann and had large grounds, sculpture gardens, and apool. The two facilities, at Oberursel and Pullach, worked together. Gehlen andBaun claimed to have six hundred intelligence agents, all former Nazis, in theSoviet zone of occupied Germany alone. According to documents kept classifiedfor fifty-one years, relations between Gehlen and Philp declined and becamehostile as Philp finally realized the true nature [endnotes.xhtml#en0933] of whohe was dealing with. The Gehlen Organization was a murderous bunch,“free-wheeling” and out of control. As one CIA affiliate observed, “Americanintelligence is a rich blind man using the Abwehr as a seeing-eye dog. The onlytrouble is—the leash is much too long.”The army became fed up with the Gehlen Organization, but there was no way out.Its operatives were professional double-crossers and liars—many were alsoalleged war criminals—and now they had the army over a barrel. Decades later itwould emerge that General Gehlen was reportedly earning a million dollars a year[endnotes.xhtml#en0934]. In late 1948, CIA director Roscoe Hillenkoetter metwith army intelligence to discuss the CIA’s taking charge of the GehlenOrganization. The two parties agreed [endnotes.xhtml#en0935], and on July 1,1949, the CIA officially assumed control of Gehlen and his men.That same summer, the CIA created the Office of Scientific Intelligence[endnotes.xhtml#en0936] (OSI), and its first director, Dr. Willard Machle,traveled to Germany to set up a program for “special interrogation methods”against Soviet spies. The CIA had intelligence indicating that the Soviets haddeveloped mind control programs. The Agency wanted to know what it would be upagainst if the Russians got hold of its American spies. In an attempt todetermine what kinds of techniques the Soviets might be using, the CIA set up aTop Secret interrogation program at Camp King. The facility offered uniqueaccess to Soviet spies who had been caught in the Gehlen Organization’s web.Revolutionary new interrogation techniques could be practiced on these men underthe operational code name Bluebird.A limited number of official CIA documents remain on record from this program.Most were destroyed by CIA director Richard Helms. Initially the CIA envisionedOperation Bluebird as a “defensive” program. Officers from ScientificIntelligence were “to apply special methods of interrogation[endnotes.xhtml#en0937] for the purpose of evaluation of Russian practices.” Butvery quickly the Agency decided that in order to master the best defensivemethods it needed to first develop the most cutting-edge offensive techniques.This sounded like doublespeak and was indicative of the Cold War mind-set thatwas taking hold in intelligence circles and also in the military. The CIAbelieved it needed to develop the sharpest sword to create the strongest, mostimpenetrable shield. Operation Bluebird was just the beginning. Soon the programwould expand to include mind control techniques and Nazi doctors recruited underOperation Paperclip."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTEEN [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter017]HALL OF MIRRORS [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter017]In the fall of 1948, in Germany, one of the most unusual press conferences[endnotes.xhtml#en0938] of the Cold War took place. Major General WalterSchreiber, the former surgeon general of the Third Reich, had last been seen onthe stand at Nuremberg testifying against fellow members of the Nazi highcommand. Then, on November 2, 1948, he reappeared at a press conference. Afterthree years, five months, and three days in Soviet custody, Schreiber hadallegedly “escaped” from his Soviet captors. Now the vaccine specialist said hehad important news to share with the free world. The press conference openedwith Schreiber delivering a brief statement about what had happened to him—he’dbeen a prisoner of the Soviets since the fall of Berlin and had recentlyescaped—followed by a lengthy question-and-answer period with an Americanofficial acting as translator. The first question asked by a reporter was, Howdid Schreiber manage to escape?Schreiber said he had “broken free” of his Communist guards in “a life or deathsituation” but hesitated to say more. With him now, in the safety of U.S.protective custody, he said, were his wife, Olga, his fourteen-year-old son,Paul-Gerhard, and one of his two grown daughters.“How was it possible the Russians let him get out?” asked another member of thepress, a question on everyone’s mind. In the two years since General Schreiber’sstunning testimony at Nuremberg, he’d been made starshina, or elder, in theSoviet military. It was almost inconceivable that a major player like Schreibersimply slipped away from his Soviet guards. Yet here he was.“I’m not asking the details,” the reporter clarified, “but how was it possiblehe was able to escape?”In November 1948, Berlin was a city under psychological and physical siege. Formore than four months now, the Soviets had blocked all rail, canal, and roadaccess between East and West Berlin. To feed the civilians in the western zone,the Americans were flying in airplanes full of food. Schreiber’s “escape”happened during the height of the Berlin Blockade.“For reasons of security, [I] would not like to answer this question,” Schreibersaid.“I don’t want to ask any details,” repeated the newsman. “But is it possible forothers who are in the same position to get out?”“The question was answered,” said Schreiber.Pressed further, Major General Dr. Schreiber reconstructed some of the events inhis tale of escape. He’d been in Soviet Russia until the summer, he said. There,he and a group of other former Nazi generals lived together in a villa outsideBerlin. In July or August, six of the generals, including Schreiber, wereunexpectedly transported to a country house on the German-Polish border, nearFrankfurt on the Oder, east of Berlin (not to be confused with Frankfurt on theMain, located in the American zone, southwest of Berlin). With regard to thismysterious journey and its greater purpose, Major General Schreiber said, “Wewere not asked, but we were told that we were going to join the police.” Onlythen, Schreiber explained, did he learn he had been “appointed Chief Medicalofficer for the newly formed [East] German police.” Schreiber said he wasoffered “food, clothing, housing, furniture… for advantages.”Four of the Nazi generals agreed to take the job. Schreiber said he objected. Hewas a scientist, not a policeman, he claimed to have told his Soviet handlers.The group of generals was transported to a home in Saxony, close to theCzechoslovakian border. Finally, “The last day of September, the four [generals]who had agreed were sent to Berlin in order to start their jobs,” Schreibersaid. He and another general, who had by this time also voiced objection,remained “guarded by police.” Two days later Schreiber was sent to Dresden, inthe Soviet zone. “There we were very well received, and I was offered the chanceto become professor at the University of Leipzig,” Schreiber told the presscorps. “I demanded the University of Berlin. I had special reason for thisdemand. That was denied of me. For this reason, I made myself free.”So that was that. A chorus of West German reporters wanted more details. Howdoes one simply make oneself free of Soviet military police, especially if oneis the former surgeon general of the Third Reich? For the Soviets, turninghigh-ranking Nazi generals into Communist officials was an immense propagandacoup in the early days of the Cold War. One had to assume that Soviet militaryintelligence (Glavnoye Razvedyvatel’noye Upravleniye, or GRU) was keeping awatchful eye on each of the generals through their transition from Soviet Russiainto the East German zone. The GRU’s notorious official emblem[endnotes.xhtml#en0939] featured an omnipotent bat hovering above the globe. TheGRU kept radarlike track of people. They had eyes in the night. To allow Dr.Schreiber to get away sounded implausible.“[I] took off alone, by express train, on the railroad, from Dresden toBerlin—and it was a trip of life and death,” Schreiber said. And that was all hewas going to say about it.Next, Schreiber began to lecture his audience on the Soviet threat. He singledout a former colleague, Vincenz Müller, to blame, not unlike what he had donewith Dr. Blome before the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg.Lieutenant General Vincenz Müller was a dangerous man, exclaimed Schreiber. Nowthat he’d gone over to the Russian side, he was a threat to world peace.Lieutenant General Müller had recently been installed by the Soviet governmentas the new police leader in Berlin, Schreiber said. “He is a fanaticalcommunist,” promised Schreiber, “completely devoted to the Russians. This is allthe more astonishing as Müller comes from a very devout Catholic family.” TheRussians had plans to arm Müller’s new Berlin police force with “heavy weapons,tanks, [and] artillery.” The Soviets had only one goal, Schreiber promised, andthat was world domination. It was beginning right now with the rearmament ofEast Berlin.“Can you give us the names of the four other generals, outside of GeneralVincenz Müller?” a news reporter asked.“I don’t think it is necessary in the scope of this press conference to givethose names,” said Schreiber.“Could the Russians be selling you a bill of goods?” asked another reporter.“The Russians are animated by the idea of world revolution,” Schreiber said. Heexplained that in Russia, most people believe “the revolution is coming.”Another news reporter asked, “Were you wearing your [Soviet] uniform” when youescaped? It was a good question. If Schreiber had been wearing his Sovietuniform, then clearly he would have been noticed by border patrol guards,stopped, and questioned as he passed from the Soviet zone to the American zoneof occupation. If Schreiber had not been wearing his Soviet uniform, then theobvious next question was, Why not? Schreiber’s answer was convoluted. HisSoviet uniform happened to be at the tailors’ shop on the day of his escape, hesaid, getting new shoulder straps and embroidery on the collar. To emphasize hispoint, Schreiber even went so far as to re-create a conversation between himselfand his Soviet handler—a man named “Fisher”—regarding the missing uniform.“Fisher said [to me], ‘You are going to get [your uniform] later. For the timebeing, this is not yet possible.’ ”The explanation seemed implausible to at least one newsman. “Why didn’t you getyour uniform tailored [earlier]?” the reporter asked.Schreiber said that his measurements had been taken for the new uniform, but thetailoring was delayed.When Schreiber’s American handler moved to change the subject, another reporterasked for more information about the human experiments Dr. Schreiber had spokenof during the Nuremberg trial. “How did the Doctor obtain knowledge ofexperiments on human beings?” he queried.Schreiber insisted he had “never taken part in any such research work.… Theknowledge [I] gained about it, [I] either gained through documents [I] ranacross in [my] position or in medical conventions, where intellectuals could seethat something like that was being conducted in the background.”Every aspect of Schreiber’s escape story seemed unreasonable, which made itdifficult for the reporters to take seriously almost anything else he said. Yetthe press conference went on for more than thirty minutes, with Schreiberstanding his ground.As it turned out, Schreiber’s press conference was not impromptu but rehearsed.He had been discussing his testimony [endnotes.xhtml#en0940] with officers fromthe U.S. Counter Intelligence Corps for two weeks—since October 18, 1948, theday he had walked into the CIC’s Berlin office. CIC special agent Severin F.Wallach was Schreiber’s handler. Wallach had heard a much longer version of whathad allegedly been going on with Schreiber since his capture by the Red Armyduring the fall of Berlin.According to the thirteen-page report by Wallach in Schreiber’s intelligencedossier, “On the 5th of May Dr. Schreiber was sent, together with other capturedGerman Generals, back to Berlin. The Generals were put in a cellar of the ReichChancellery in Berlin and received orders to emerge from this cellar understrong Soviet guard. This whole scene was photographed by the Soviets, who wereengaged in putting together an ‘authentic’ documentary film of the capture ofBerlin.” On May 9, with the Reich’s surrender complete, Dr. Schreiber was sentwith other officers to a much larger prisoner of war camp, in Posen, where hestayed until August 12, 1945. A transport of generals to Moscow had beenorganized; Schreiber said he arrived there on August 29. “The transport was verybadly organized,” Schreiber said, according to the dossier report. “There was afood shortage because the cooks on the transport sold the food on the blackmarket or kept it for themselves.” Schreiber’s testimony was resplendent withdetails. “All generals were sent to the PW camp No. 7027 in Krasnogorsk, nearMoscow,” he recalled. Here, the food tasted wonderful because it came from theUnited States, in cans. Schreiber repeatedly told Wallach how much he lovedeverything about the United States.On March 12, 1946, Schreiber said he was transferred to the Lubyanka prison inMoscow. “Treatment not bad.” On March 20 he claimed to have been interrogated bythe Russians for the first time: “Subject was The German Preparation forBiological Warfare.” Wallach had to have known that this was highly improbable.Schreiber was one of the Third Reich’s highest-ranking medical doctors, and hewas a major general in the army. On March 20, 1946, he would have been in Sovietcustody for ten months. That this was his first interrogation was absurd.Schreiber told Wallach he was questioned by a lieutenant general named Kabulowfor three days. Kabulow didn’t believe his testimony, Schreiber said, and so hewas told, “Soviet interrogators are going to use now physical violence to break[you] and get the whole truth out of [you].” The next interrogation, recalledSchreiber, took place at three o’clock that same morning. “[I was] beaten by aSoviet officer who me knows as Lt. Smirnow [Smirnov]. Together with a Col.Walter Stern, who speaks German without the slightest accent and who [was] anexcellent interrogator.”Schreiber said he withstood three weeks of rough interrogation, at which pointhe finally broke down and “wrote the statement which later on was submitted bythe Soviet Government to the International War Crimes Tribunal in Nuremberg.” Hewas flown from Moscow to Berlin, then down to Nuremberg to testify at the warcrimes trial. During one of the flights Schreiber said his German-speakingSoviet interrogator, Colonel Stern, leaned over and whispered a warning to him.If Schreiber were to go off-book and say “anything detrimental to the interestsof the Soviet Union, he would be hanged on his return to Russia.”After testifying at Nuremberg, Schreiber said he was taken back to the SovietUnion, where he and three generals were set up in a two-story country house inTomilino, sixteen miles southeast of Moscow. One of the three generals was FieldMarshal Friedrich Paulus—the highest-ranking Nazi general to ever havesurrendered to the Soviets, which Paulus did during the Battle of Stalingrad.Paulus’s own story, of the events leading up to his capture and his finalcommunication with Hitler, was remarkable. The Soviets had also brought Paulusto testify at Nuremberg.As William Shirer explained in The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, the lastdays of Paulus’s command during the battle for Stalingrad were cataclysmic.“Paulus, torn between his duty to obey the mad Fuehrer and his obligation tosave his own surviving troops from annihilation, appealed to Hitler.” Paulussent an urgent message to the Führer that read, “Troops without ammunition orfood… Effective command no longer possible… 18,000 wounded without any suppliesor dressings or drugs… Further defense senseless. Collapse inevitable. Armyrequests immediate permission to surrender in order to save lives of remainingtroops.” But Hitler refused to allow Paulus [endnotes.xhtml#en0941] tosurrender. “Surrender is forbidden,” Hitler wrote in return, “Sixth Army willhold their positions to the last man and the last round and by their heroicendurance [endnotes.xhtml#en0942] will make an unforgettable contribution towardthe establishment of a defensive front and the salvation of the Western world.”“Heroic endurance” was a euphemism for suicide. Paulus was now supposed to killhimself. Hitler nudged him further in this direction by making Paulus a fieldmarshal in what he hoped would be the last hour of the general’s life. “There isno record in military history of a German Field Marshal being taken prisoner,”Hitler told Alfred Jodl, who was standing next to him at the time. Instead, at7:45 the following morning, Field Marshal Paulus surrendered. His last messageto Hitler: “The Russians are at the door of our bunker. We are destroying ourequipment.” He was taken prisoner shortly thereafter. What Paulus left behindwas, as described by Shirer, a terrifying scene: “91,000 German soldiers[endnotes.xhtml#en0943], including twenty-four generals, half-starved,frostbitten, many of them wounded, all of them dazed and broken, were hobblingover the ice and snow, clutching their blood-caked blankets over their headsagainst the 24-degrees-below-zero cold toward the dreary, frozen prisoner-of-warcamps of Siberia.” Of the ninety-one thousand Germans taken prisoner by theSoviets, only five thousand would come out of the prison camps alive. Paulus wasone of them.By 1947, he was living comfortably [endnotes.xhtml#en0944] in this two-storycountry house with Major General Dr. Schreiber, outside Berlin. Actually,explained Schreiber, there were a total of four former Nazi generals livingtogether under one roof. In addition to Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus, therewas Lieutenant General Vincenz Müller, captured outside Minsk in 1944, andGeneral Erich Buschenhagen, captured in eastern Romania in August 1944. For whatpurpose? Wallach asked. “Subject [Schreiber] is convinced Lt. Gen VincenzMueller was ordered by the Soviets to indoctrinate Professor Dr. Schreiber withcommunistic ideas.” Whatever the real reason, Schreiber said he and his fellowgenerals lived a relatively enjoyable life full of Soviet perks. At one pointGeneral Schreiber and General Buschenhagen were taken to live “in Moscow in anicely furnished private house.” Their Soviet handler, with them constantly,“acted as a guide and took them to the museum, opera and to play-housesstressing the fact that Soviet Russia has a highly developed culture.” ForSchreiber, the motive was clear. “This, too, was of course part of the plannedindoctrination program,” he told Special Agent Wallach [endnotes.xhtml#en0945].All the while, Schreiber feigned that he was a happy Communist.In July 1947, Field Marshal Paulus became sick and the group was “taken to asummer resort, Livadia, on the Crimea.” There was no shortage of irony here.This was the same palatial resort at which the Yalta Conference took place, inFebruary 1945. The dangerous Lieutenant General Vincenz Müller was with Paulusand Schreiber at the resort. The group stayed through the summer and returned toMoscow, by private jet, when the summer weather passed. For the next year, theformer Nazi generals resided again at the country house in Tomilino, Schreibersaid. Only now they were heavily engaged in antifascist courses that the Sovietsrequired them to take. Studying kept the generals occupied until September 7,1948. That’s when Schreiber said he learned that he and twenty-five other formerNazi generals would be leaving for East Germany at once. After Schreiber said noto the police job, he was brought to Dresden and put up in the Hotel WeisserHirsch, at Bergbahnstrasse 12. His handler, the man called Fisher, agreed torelease him from police work, Schreiber said. Fisher stepped away to work onarrangements regarding Schreiber’s teaching position. According to Schreiber,that was when he got away.Special Agent Wallach summarized the details. “Subject remained alone withoutanybody looking after him… Subject simply took a train in Dresden on the 17thand arrived in Berlin on the same day. After contacting his family in Berlin…subject established contact with this agent… and was since then under theprotection of U.S. authorities in Berlin. At the end of October subject wasevacuated with his family to the U.S. Zone for detailed exploitation by ECIC[European Command Intelligence Center],” Camp King.Was Schreiber a double agent? Was he a true-to-life James Bond? How was he ableto resist the Soviets’ notoriously brutal interrogation techniques when so manyothers—from hardened generals to civilians to spies—were beaten into human ruin?Was he a charlatan? Or a weasel of a man, uniquely skilled at saving his ownhide? What was he really doing in Soviet Russia for three and a half years?Special Agent Wallach drew his own conclusion. “Subject made an excellentimpression on the undersigned agent. It is not believed that subject is a Sovietplant,” wrote Wallach. He signed his name in black ink.Wallach’s interrogation report was sent to the director of the IntelligenceDivision of the U.S. Army, EUCOM, with a memo written by Wallach’s CIC superiormarked “Secret-Confidential.” It read: “Subject [Schreiber] claims to knoweverybody in his transport, their background, political attitude and new jobassignments… Will be ready for transfer to your headquarters for detailedinterrogation in about six days.” Schreiber had told Wallach he had informationon all the high-ranking Nazis now working for the East German police.On November 3, 1948, the director of the Intelligence Division of the U.S. Armysent a telegram marked “Secret” to JIOA headquarters at the Pentagon, with acopy also sent to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “If the Surgeon General repliesthat Schreiber is of importance to national security, his case should beprocessed under JCS procedure for immigration to the U.S.” Major General Dr.Prof. Walter Schreiber, the former surgeon general of the Third Reich, was aboutto become part of Operation Paperclip. In the meantime, he and his family weretaken to Camp King and put up in a safe house there. When General Charles E.Loucks learned that Schreiber was in U.S. custody, he traveled to Camp King tointerview him. Loucks was the man who had welcomed Hitler’s chemists into hishome in Heidelberg to work on the secret formula for sarin production. He wasparticularly interested in learning from Dr. Schreiber about vaccines or serumsproduced by the Reich to defend against nerve agents.Loucks found Schreiber [endnotes.xhtml#en0946] to be “cooperative in allrespects” and hired him to work for the U.S. Chemical Corps “in compiling dataconcerning the Nazi Chemical Corps.” To oversee the project, General Louckstraveled back and forth from Heidelberg to Camp King. Next, Schreiber was hiredto write a monograph for the U.S. Army about his experiences in Russia. WhenLoucks was finished working with Schreiber, he was asked by Camp King’scommanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Gordon D. Ingraham, if he would testifyas to Schreiber’s character for the doctor’s OMGUS security report. GivenSchreiber’s position as a general in the Nazi high command, it was going to takeserious effort on the part of JIOA to bring Schreiber into the United States.Loucks agreed but was uncharacteristically skeptical of the Nazi general’smotivations. “Loucks stated subject was energetic [endnotes.xhtml#en0947] and agood organizer of work projects.… Schreiber had apparently given accurateinformation [to Loucks] on all occasions [which has] been checked and confirmedby Technical Research experts in the United States.… However, Loucks stated thatSchreiber may also have given this same information ‘to the Russians.’ ” Louckstold Lieutenant Colonel Ingraham that he “believed that Schreiber could bepersuaded by any attractive offer.” In other words, Schreiber’s loyalty could bebought.At Camp King, Dr. Schreiber and his family were moved into a nice home providedby the U.S. Army. Despite General Loucks’s concern about Schreiber’strustworthiness, in November 1949 Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber was hiredby army intelligence to serve as post physician [endnotes.xhtml#en0948] at theclandestine interrogation facility that was Camp King. According to Schreiber’sdeclassified OMGUS security report, his new job involved “handling all themedical problems at Camp King [and] caring for internees.” This meant Schreiberwas in charge of the health and well-being of the Soviet prisoners held here,some of whom were being subjected to “special interrogation methods” by the CIA.Given the army’s obsession with Soviet spies and the possibility of doubleagents, hiring a Nazi general turned Soviet starshina was an unusual choice whenone considered the real possibility that Schreiber had not escaped from theRussians but was working for them. If Schreiber was a Soviet spy, it would havebeen very easy for him to learn everything that the CIA and militaryintelligence were doing at Camp King.On the other hand, if Schreiber really had escaped from the Russians, then therewas a lot to be exploited from his Soviet experience. Having been a prisoner ofthe Russians for the past three and a half years, he was familiar with at leastsome of the Soviets’ interrogation techniques. He spoke Russian fluently aswell. Lieutenant Colonel Ingraham was confident that Dr. Schreiber was atruth-teller. Ingraham kept him on as post doctor until August 1951. ColonelIngraham also hired Schreiber’s twenty-three-year-old daughter, DorotheaSchreiber, to serve as his personal secretary.While employed at Camp King, Schreiber told his Army handler that the Russianswere trying to capture and kill him and he asked to use the cover name of “DocFischer,” to hide his identity. It was a cryptic choice for an alias. “Fisher”had been the name of the Soviet handler [endnotes.xhtml#en0949] from whomSchreiber had allegedly escaped, in Dresden, and it was also the name of an SSdoctor who served as one of Schreiber’s wartime subordinates at the Ravensbrückconcentration camp. Dr. Fritz Fischer had performed medical experiments onPolish women and girls at Ravensbrück, crimes for which he had been tried andconvicted of murder at the Nuremberg doctors’ trial. Fritz Fischer was one ofthe few doctors who had accepted his guilt over the course of the trial. Afterhearing some particularly shocking witness testimony against him, Dr. Fischerconfided in war crimes investigator Dr. Alexander about how he felt. “I wouldhave liked to stand up [endnotes.xhtml#en0950] and say hang me immediately,”Fischer told Alexander.Looking at the whole scenario—Dr. Schreiber, Doc Fischer, the Soviet Mr. Fisher,and the SS doctor Fritz Fischer—was like seeing a man standing in a hall ofmirrors. But then again Operation Paperclip was a world marked by duplicity anddeception. It was impossible to know who was telling the truth.In September 1949, John J. McCloy became U.S. high commissioner of AlliedGermany, marking the end of more than four years of military rule of Germany bythe Allies. The day also marked the beginning of the end of the time Dr. OttoAmbros would spend in prison for war crimes. Soon he would be placed on theOperation Paperclip target list.Ambros, Hitler’s favorite chemist, had been incarcerated for roughly one year[endnotes.xhtml#en0951] of an eight-year prison sentence. On July 30, 1948,Ambros had been convicted of mass murder and slavery in Case No. VI of thesubsequent Nuremberg proceedings, the IG Farben trial, and sent to LandsbergPrison, also called War Criminal Prison No. 1. Located thirty-eight miles westof Munich, Landsberg was home to 1,526 convicted Nazi war criminals. The menwere housed in a central prison barracks inside individual cells, but thefacility itself was situated on a boarding school–like campus[endnotes.xhtml#en0952], with nineteenth-century buildings, leafy parks, and agrand, wood-paneled Catholic church. Adolf Hitler had been a prisoner here foreight months in 1924. Landsberg Prison was where Hitler wrote Mein Kampf.In prison Ambros taught “chemical technology” to other inmates as part of aprisoner education program. He penned letters to his mother expressing howunfair it all was. “Politic[s] is a bitter disease [endnotes.xhtml#en0953] andit is grotesque that I, as a non-political person, should suffer for something Ihave not done,” he wrote. “But one day, all this suffering will cease and thenit will not be long before I have forgotten all this bitterness.” Ambros’snineteen-year-old son, Dieter Ambros, wrote clemency appeals on his father’sbehalf. “My father is innocent as you know,” began one letter to Bishop TheophilWurm, a Protestant leader who regularly advocated for the war criminals’release. “Thank you for supporting our efforts… my father is [being] illegallyheld [endnotes.xhtml#en0954].” Ambros was a model prisoner. Only once was hewritten up for disciplinary action [endnotes.xhtml#en0955]: “Inmate Ambros,Otto, WCPL No. 1442 was standing and looking out the window at the women’sexercise yard [and] this is against the prison regulations,” reads a note in hisprison file.Otto Ambros had many lawyers working for him to secure an early release. He alsowrote petitions himself, requesting small items. In 1948, he asked the prisonboard for an extra pillow, softer than the one provided. In 1949, he requestedpermission [endnotes.xhtml#en0956] to keep his accordion in his cell. Each year,Ambros saw the Landsberg Prison doctor for a checkup. Convicted Nazi warcriminal Dr. Oskar Schröder, former chief of the Medical Corps Services of theLuftwaffe, checked Ambros’s vitals and wrote up his annual health report[endnotes.xhtml#en0957]. Schröder had been employed by the U.S. Army Air Forcesat the Aero Medical Center in Heidelberg before the doctors’ trial and was nowserving a life term at Landsberg. Also in the prison were HermannBecker-Freyseng and Wilhelm Beiglböck, serving twenty and fifteen yearsentences, respectively.The twelve subsequent war crimes trials at Nuremberg had ended just a few monthsprior to John J. McCloy’s becoming high commissioner of Germany. Most Americanshad long since lost interest in following any of the trials. The majority ofGermans disagreed with the whole war crimes trial premise, and many saw thoseconvicted as having been singled out by American and British victors and given“victors’ justice” [endnotes.xhtml#en0958] as punishment. At war’s end, U.S.occupation authorities had determined that 3.6 million Nazis in the Americanzone alone were “indictable” for political or war crimes. This enormous numberwas eventually whittled down to a more manageable 930,000 individuals, who werethen processed through 169,282 denazification trials. More than 50,000 Germanshad been convicted of various Nazi-era crimes, most in the Spruchkammern courtsbut also in Allied military tribunals. The majority of those convicted servedsome time in postwar detention camps or paid nominal fines. When McCloy tookoffice [endnotes.xhtml#en0960], 806 Nazis had been sentenced to death and sentto Landsberg Prison, with 486 executions carried out to date. By the fall of1949, the German press had begun referring to the convicted criminals held atLandsberg as the “so-called prisoners of war.” [endnotes.xhtml#en0959] This wasjust one of the sensitive issues that Commissioner McCloy was faced with when hearrived. Another was Operation Paperclip.McCloy had been a champion of the Nazi scientist program from its very firstdays, back in the late spring of 1945, when he served as assistant secretary ofwar. He was also the chairman of the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee atthe time, which put him in charge of making some of the first decisionsregarding the fate of the program. McCloy was a statesman and a lawyer but hewas also an economist. In between his tenure as assistant secretary of war andhigh commissioner of Germany, he was president of the World Bank. His servicethere came at a critical time in the bank’s early history. McCloy is credited inWorld Bank literature [endnotes.xhtml#en0961] as “defining the relationshipbetween the Bank and the United Nations and the Bank and the United States.” Nowhe was back in government service as a diplomat, having come to Germany to fillthe shoes of General Lucius D. Clay, exiting OMGUS chief. John J. McCloy was ashort, plump man, balding, with a banker’s bravado. When in public he almostalways wore a crisp suit. As high commissioner he traveled around Germany in theprivate diesel train that had belonged to Adolf Hitler [endnotes.xhtml#en0962].While power had been officially transferred to a new West German civiliangovernment, run by Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, McCloy remained in charge of manyaspects of Germany’s law and order as West Germany transitioned into becomingits own sovereign nation once again. One area that Chancellor Adenauer hadabsolutely no jurisdiction over was the Landsberg prisoners. Several hundred ofthese convicted war criminals had already been hanged in the Landsbergcourtyard. Eighty-six others faced death. When McCloy took office as highcommissioner, the rhetoric around the Landsberg prisoners was at an all-timehigh. Many Germans wanted [endnotes.xhtml#en0963] the prisoners released.In November of 1949, a group of German lawyers linked to the Farbenindustrialists, including Otto Ambros, requested a meeting with John J. McCloyat his office in the former IG Farben building, in Frankfurt. The IG Farbenbuilding had been taken over by the U.S. Army when troops entered Frankfurt inMarch of 1945 and had served as a home for the U.S. Army and various U.S.government organizations ever since. The massive complex—the largest officebuilding in Europe [endnotes.xhtml#en0964] until the 1950s—had panoramic viewsof Frankfurt, as well as parklands, a sports field, and a pond. In August 1949,OMGUS moved its headquarters from Berlin to Frankfurt, and shortly thereafterthe U.S. high commissioner’s office headquarters were set up in the IG Farbencomplex. In September 1949, McCloy settled in [endnotes.xhtml#en0965]. The CIAmaintained an office in the IG Farben building throughout the Cold War. It waslocated [endnotes.xhtml#en0966] just a few floors and a few doors down fromMcCloy’s office.It was a precarious time for an American civilian to be governing occupiedGermany. The Soviets had just detonated their first atomic bomb, years ahead ofwhat had been predicted by the CIA. The U.S. military was on high alert, perhapsnowhere more so than in West Germany. During the November meeting in McCloy’soffice at the IG Farben complex, German lawyers told McCloy that if West Germanyand the United States were going to move forward together in a united frontagainst the Communist threat, something had to be done [endnotes.xhtml#en0967]about the men incarcerated at Landsberg. These prisoners were viewed unanimouslyby Germans as “political prisoners,” the lawyers said, and they told McCloy thathe should grant all of them clemency.After the meeting, McCloy sent a memo to the legal department[endnotes.xhtml#en0968] of the Allied High Commission, inquiring if “aftersentences were imposed by military tribunal,” he, as U.S. high commissioner, hadany authority to review the sentences. The legal department told him that as faras the Landsberg war criminals were concerned, he had the authority to dowhatever he thought appropriate. In America, Telford Taylor, the formerNuremberg prosecutor general, caught wind of what was going on in the highcommissioner’s office in Frankfurt and was outraged. He wrote to McCloy toremind him that the Nazi war criminals at Landsberg “are without any questionamong the most deliberate, shameless murderers [endnotes.xhtml#en0969] of theentire Nuremberg List, and any idea of further clemency in their cases seems tome out of the question.” McCloy never responded [endnotes.xhtml#en0970],according to McCloy’s biographer, Kai Bird.McCloy established an official review board to examine the war criminals’sentences—the Advisory Board on Clemency for War Criminals, known as the PeckPanel [endnotes.xhtml#en0971], after its chairman, David W. Peck. A powerfulformer Nazi lieutenant general, Hans Speidel, appealed personally to McCloy.Speidel was one of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer’s chief advisers on rearmament, ahighly controversial subject but one being discussed nonetheless. Hans Speidel’syounger brother, Wilhelm Speidel, was a convicted war criminal at Landsberg.Speidel told McCloy’s adjunct in Bonn [endnotes.xhtml#en0972], “[If] theprisoners at Landsberg were hanged, Germany as an armed ally against the Eastwas an illusion.” In a similarly bullish manner, Chancellor Konrad Adenauer toldMcCloy the same thing, advising him that he should grant “the widest possibleclemency [endnotes.xhtml#en0973] for persons sentenced to confinement.”In June 1950, North Korean forces, supported by Communist benefactors, movedacross the 38th parallel, marking the start of the Korean War. The idea that theCommunists were also about to invade Western Europe took hold in the Pentagon.On July 14, 1950, the commander at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base sent anurgent memo to Operation Paperclip’s in-house champion, Colonel Donald Putt:“Due to the threat [endnotes.xhtml#en0974] of impending hostilities in Europeand the possibility that forces of the USSR may rapidly overrun the continent,this command is concerned with the problem of the immediate implementation of anevacuation program for German and Austrian scientists.” Were these scientists to“fall into enemy hands… they would constitute a threat to our nationalsecurity.” Air force intelligence recommended to JIOA that it initiate a “massprocurement effort” in Germany. JIOA agreed and began making formal plans withthe high commissioner’s office to effect this.The Korean War sparked a new fire under Operation Paperclip. Inside the highcommissioner’s office, McCloy maintained a group called the Scientific ResearchDivision that was specifically dedicated to the issue of German scientists. Thehead of the division was Dr. Carl Nordstrom, and ever since McCloy had takenoffice Nordstrom had been trying to expedite the procession of German scientiststo America. Dr. Nordstrom maintained a thick file [endnotes.xhtml#en0975]labeled “Allocation of German Scientists and Technicians” and had sent manyeyes-only memos to McCloy in “support of certain research projects” he foresawas valuable to national interest. Now, in light of the Korean War, Nordstrom gota new job from JIOA. He was assigned to be the German liaison to a new JIOAprogram being fast-tracked out of the Pentagon, named Accelerated Paperclip butcalled Project 63 in the field: A number of Germans had soured on the namePaperclip. The premise of the Accelerated Paperclip program was to move“especially dangerous top level scientists [endnotes.xhtml#en0977]” out ofGermany in a “modified Denial Program” that needed to be kept away from theSoviets at all costs. The high commissioner’s office began working with armyintelligence to “evacuate” 150 of these scientists, code-named the “K” list,from Germany to the United States. A group of American officers called theSpecial Projects Team would be dispatched to recruit the “K” list scientists.The Joint Chiefs of Staff approved a prodigious $1 million procurement budget tohelp entice these “especially dangerous top level scientists” to come toAmerica, the equivalent of approximately $10 million in 2013.Accelerated Paperclip, or Project 63, meetings [endnotes.xhtml#en0978] were heldat the high commissioner’s offices in Wiesbaden and Frankfurt, with Dr. CarlNordstrom keeping notes. Representatives from JIOA [endnotes.xhtml#en0979], thearmy, the air force, EUCOM, and the CIA attended. Because many on the “K” listdid not have a job offer already in place, the JIOA decided to set up aclandestine office in New York City, at the Alamac Hotel, where the scientistscould live while they waited for assignments. The Accelerated Paperclip projectdirector in America, Colonel William H. Speidel (no known relation to theWilhelm Speidel war criminal at Landsberg Prison or his lawyer brother),maintained an office there. An entire block of rooms was set aside in thenineteen-story hotel, on Seventy-first Street and Broadway, for a yet-unnamedgroup of German scientists scheduled to arrive at a future date. A welcomebrochure was printed up and kept on file at the high commissioner’s office. “Toinsure your comfort, convenience and interest in general,” it read, “a competentofficer, assisted by a carefully selected staff… will serve your interests fromthe time of your arrival until the time of your departure to enter employment.”The officer “will maintain an office at the hotel in which you reside and beprepared to complete, or make provisions for, all arrangements incident tohousing, restaurant facilities, securing medical services, and theadministrative details of the project.” The U.S. Army’s “primary interest,”[endnotes.xhtml#en0980] the scientists were told, “is in providing for yourcomfort, contentment, happiness and security [and] efforts will be directed tohelp you in attaining these goals with a minimum [of] friction, distraction, anddelay.”But the program did not take off like fire in dry grass, as Dr. Nordstrom hadhoped it would. Much to everyone’s surprise, the offers made under AcceleratedPaperclip were rejected by many of the German scientists who were approached.When JIOA requested an explanation from the high commissioner’s office as towhy, Nordstrom reported that some on the “K” list were simply “too old, toorich, too busy and too thoroughly disgruntled with past experiences withAmericans,” to see a free room at the Alamac Hotel in New York City as a careermove. Besides, Germany had its own chancellor now, and for the first time infive years, many German scientists saw that a prosperous scientific future waspossible in their own country.Others could not wait to come to America. With Accelerated Paperclip’s newestpolicy in place, Class I offenders could now be put on a JIOA list. Thisincluded Dr. Schreiber, still serving as post physician at Camp King. AnotherClass I offender was Dr. Kurt Blome, former deputy surgeon general of the ThirdReich and Hitler’s biological weapons expert. The sword and the shield.Finally, there was Dr. Otto Ambros, the war criminal convicted at Nuremberg ofslavery and mass murder. In the winter of 1951, Otto Ambros was placed on theJIOA list [endnotes.xhtml#en0981] for Accelerated Paperclip even though he wasstill incarcerated at Landsberg Prison.In January of 1951, John J. McCloy’s office announced that he had come to adecision regarding the war criminals incarcerated at Landsberg Prison. The PeckPanel had finished its review process and recommended “substantial reductions ofsentences” in the majority of cases involving lengthy prison terms. As for thosewho had been handed death sentences, the panel advised McCloy to consider eachcase individually. Also at issue was a financial matter. At Nuremberg, thejudges had ordered the confiscation of property of convicted war criminals whosemoney was so often earned on the backs of slave laborers, tens of thousands ofwhom had been worked to death. Now, the Peck Panel suggested[endnotes.xhtml#en0982] that this confiscation order be rescinded. For OttoAmbros, this would mean that he could keep what remained of the gift, from AdolfHitler, of 1 million reichsmarks [endnotes.xhtml#en0983], a figure that hasnever been revealed before. McCloy spent several months considering the panel’srecommendations [endnotes.xhtml#en0984]. During this time he was deluged withletters from religious groups and activists in Germany urging for the warcriminals’ release. McCloy sent a cable from Frankfurt to Washington asking forcounsel from the White House. The White House advised McCloy that the decisionwas his to make.John J. McCloy commuted [endnotes.xhtml#en0985] ten of the fifteen deathsentences. This meant that ten men condemned by International Military Tribunaljudges—including the commander of the Malmédy Massacre, considered one of thewar’s worst atrocities against prisoners of war, and several SS officers who hadoverseen the mobile killing units called Einsatzgruppen—would be released backinto society within one and seven years. Among the death sentences McCloy choseto uphold were those of Otto Ohlendorf, commander of Einsatzgruppe D,responsible for ninety thousand deaths in Ukraine; Paul Blobel, commander ofEinsatzgruppe C, responsible for thirty-three thousand deaths at Babi Yar, inKiev; and Oswald Pohl, chief administrator of the concentration camps. McCloyalso drastically reduced the sentences of sixty-four out of seventy-fourremaining war criminals, which meant that one-third of the inmates tried atNuremberg were freed [endnotes.xhtml#en0986]. On February 3, 1951, Otto Ambrostraded in his red-striped denim prison uniform [endnotes.xhtml#en0987] for thetailored suit he had arrived in. He walked out of the gates of Landsberg Prisona free man, his finances fully restored.General Telford Taylor was indignant. In a press release he stated, “Wittinglyor not, McCloy has dealt a blow to the principles of international law andconcepts of humanity for which we fought the war.” Eleanor Roosevelt asked inher newspaper column, “Why are we freeing so many Nazis?[endnotes.xhtml#en0988]”The will and wherewithal to punish Nazi war criminals had faded with the passageof time. “Doctors who had participated [endnotes.xhtml#en0989] in the murder ofpatients continued to practice medicine, Nazi judges continued to preside overcourtrooms, and former members of the SS, SD and Gestapo found positions in theintelligence services,” explains Andreas Nachama, curator of the NaziDocumentation Center in Berlin. “Even some leaders of the special mobilecommandos (“Einsatzkommandos”) [paramilitary extermination squads] tried topursue careers in the public service.”The following month, on March 27, 1951, Dr. Carl Nordstrom dispatched CharlesMcPherson, an officer with the Special Projects Team, to go locate and hire Dr.Kurt Blome. The Special Projects Team was now composed of a group of twentyagents, each with his own “K” list of scientists to find. McPherson learned thatBlome lived at 34 Kielstrasse, in Dortmund, and he traveled there to interviewthe doctor.During his first visit, Charles McPherson learned [endnotes.xhtml#en0990] thatDr. Blome lived in the apartment adjacent to Blome’s private physician’spractice in Dortmund during the week. On weekends he returned to his home inHagen, twelve miles away, to be with his family. “His English is excellent andno interpreter is necessary to carry on a conversation,” McPherson wrote in hisreport. The reason for the visit, McPherson told Dr. Blome, was to offer Blome acontract with Operation Paperclip. “He stated he would definitely beinterested.” Dr. Blome requested more details. “He feels he is too old to begina new type of work and would prefer to return to biological research or cancerresearch.” Blome alluded to the fact that he had already worked on Top Secretgerm warfare research for the British, under Operation Matchbox, the Britishequivalent of Operation Paperclip. Blome said that the British had helped securehis house in Hagen for him. McPherson left Dortmund with the impression that thefifty-seven-year-old was “very interested but would need a definite offer beforehe could make up his mind.”Approximately three months later, on Thursday, June 21, 1951, McPherson againinterviewed Dr. Blome. “I presented him with a copy of our contract form andinformed him that we were willing to pay him about $6400 per year for theduration of the contract.” Blome had additional questions. He asked McPhersonabout the buying power of this salary and the amount of taxes he would have topay. “He then had another request which I informed him that I could do nothingabout,” McPherson wrote. Blome said he had “some money which was tied up in aprofessional account because it had been determined that these are funds of theNazi Party.” Blome asked McPherson for his help in trying to release the moneyback to him, and to look into “the possibilities of transferring [the money]from Marks into Dollars,” in order to bring it to the United States. McPhersonexplained, “I informed him that there was no legal means at present of doingthis but that this could be transacted through Switzerland.”Blome said he needed some time [endnotes.xhtml#en0991] to read over the contractand to discuss the matter with his wife. He said he’d get in touch withMcPherson in about two weeks. In August it was official: “Professor Kurt Blomewas contracted under Project 63 on 21 August. Will be ready for shipment 15November,” McPherson wrote. The Blomes took their boys out of school[endnotes.xhtml#en0992] and began teaching them English. Dr. Blome turned hispractice over to another doctor in Dortmund. The couple traveled to the BerlinDocument Center and provided sworn testimony regarding their Nazi past. Thedocuments were reviewed by McCloy’s office. Per Accelerated Paperclip, a keydocument that would be used for a visa application, the Revised Security Reporton German (or Austrian) Scientist or Important Technician, was drawn up.The single most important element governing justification of AcceleratedPaperclip/Project 63 was now stated on page one: “Based on available records…Subjects have not been in the past and are not at the present time members ofthe Communist Party.” The issue of being an ardent Nazi had lost first positionand was relegated down to section six. There, the issue of Blome’s Nazi Partyrecord was addressed: “Kurt Blome entered the Party on 1 July 1931 with Partynumber 590233. He is also listed as a member of the SA since 1941 and is aholder of the Golden Party Badge since 1943. His wife, Dr. Bettina Blome,entered the Party on 1 April 1940 with Party number 8,257,157.” It was alsonoted, “The 66th CIC Central Registry contains a Secret dossier on Dr. KurtBlome.” Those details were separately classified.“Based on available records, Subjects were not war criminals but undoubtedlywere ardent Nazis,” wrote Lieutenant Colonel Harry R. Smith, an authorizedrepresentative of John J. McCloy. Blome was a Nazi ideologue and Smith statedso. He also wrote that Blome was not likely to become a security threat. “It isthe opinion of the United States High Commissioner for Germany that they are notlikely to become security threats to the United States.” The report was signedand dated September 27, 1951. Two weeks later, on October 10, 1951, Blome’ssecret Accelerated Paperclip [endnotes.xhtml#en0993] contract was approved. Buton October 4, 1951, the chief of Army Intelligence, G-2, a colonel by the nameof Garrison B. Coverdale, read the high commissioner’s security report on Dr.Blome and rejected Blome’s admission to Operation Paperclip. McCloy’srepresentative, Lieutenant Colonel Harry R. Smith, had failed to do the mostimportant thing necessary when it came to drawing up a Paperclip contract: tolie by omission about Nazi party loyalty. All kinds of phrases could be used toallow the State Department to turn a blind eye to its legal obligation to keepNazis out of the United States. Most OMGUS security officers knew to write “nota security threat” or “merely an opportunist” in the space that asked about thescientist’s Nazi Party record. After reading the report, Colonel Garrison B.Coverdale sent a confidential cable to the director of JIOA in Washington,stating, “Attention is invited to paragraph 6 of subject report.” In stating thetruth, Lieutenant Colonel Harry R. Smith made it impossible for Dr. Blome’sPaperclip contract to be approved.On October 12, 1951, the JIOA and Army Intelligence read the high commissioner’sreport. A confidential memo from the Department of the Army in Heidelberg wassent back marked urgent: “Suspend shpmt Dr. Kurt Blome [endnotes.xhtml#en0994]appears inadmissible in view of HICOG [High Commissioner of Germany].”McPherson would not readily accept this setback. “Blome contract signed andapproved Commander in Chief. Subject completing preparations for shipment lateNovember. Has already turned over private practice Dortmund to another doctor.In view of adverse publicity [endnotes.xhtml#en0995] which might ensue and whichmay destroy entire program this theatre recommend[s] subject be shipped forcompletion 6 months portion contract,” he wrote. The case was sent to theconsulate for an opinion. On October 24, 1951, the consulate in Frankfurt agreedwith army intelligence: “Frankfurt Consul states Blome inadmissible.”Charles McPherson saw Blome’s rejection as calamitous. It interfered with thecore mission of the Special Projects Team and jeopardized the success of theentire Accelerated Paperclip program [endnotes.xhtml#en0976], he believed.“Recommend Blome be shipped [endnotes.xhtml#en0996] and ostensibly occupied oninconsequential activities in the United States for 6 months,” McPhersonsuggested. But that idea was rejected, too.McPherson contacted Blome by telephone. They agreed to meet at the Burgtor Hotelin Dortmund. McPherson brought a colleague from the Special Projects Team alongwith him this time, Philip Park. McPherson’s job was “to explain to [Blome] thereasons why we were unable to send him to the United States at the presenttime.” Agent Park could back him up if uncomfortable questions arose.“Professor Blome was alone when we came in. I commenced by saying that I hadsome bad news to tell him,” McPherson wrote in a memo. “I then stated that dueto another change in our security laws we were forced to suspend our shipmentsto the United States.”Blome was no fool. This was a man who skillfully argued at Nuremberg that intentwas not a crime and was acquitted on these grounds. Now, at the Burgtor Hotel,Blome made clear to McPherson that he did not believe McPherson’s lies. Blomehad recently been in communication with his colleague and former professorPasqual Jordan and was entirely aware that Jordan was actively being preparedfor Accelerated Paperclip work. Blome told McPherson that he had recently beenin contact with one of his deputies in biological warfare research, therinderpest expert Professor Erich Traub. Blome told McPherson that he was wellaware that Traub had recently gone to America “under the auspices of thePaperclip Project.” Blome was particularly upset because Traub[endnotes.xhtml#en0997] had worked under him during the war.McPherson tried to placate Dr. Blome. “I then said that we were still ready toput his contract in effect and that we had a position for him at a military postin Frankfurt, probably as a post doctor.” McPherson suggested that Blome comehave a look at the facility, that it was a pleasant place and offered awell-paying job. “He and his wife agreed,” McPherson wrote in his report. Still,McPherson saw the situation with Dr. Blome as potentially disastrous. “Theundersigned wishes to point out that he did not tell the Blomes that theiropportunity to go to the United States is apparently nil and apparently willremain that way, but took the slant that our shipments have been suspended foran indefinite duration. This will leave the way open in the event something canbe done.”McPherson worried that the Blome affair was going to have an unfavorable effect“upon our project not only by the immediate individuals concerned but by thechain reaction produced by one individual telling the other that the Americanshave broken their word.” McPherson was actively recruiting other Germanscientists at the same time. He believed that he had a handle on how thescientists communicated among themselves. “The professional class of Germany istightly enough knit so that this word will be widely disseminated and the futureeffectiveness of our program will be greatly curtailed.”McPherson was wrong. Not all the former Nazis in the “professional class” talkedamong themselves. Dr. Blome was not aware that the reason a job offer as amilitary post doctor near Frankfurt was available to him was because theprevious post doctor, also a former high-ranking Nazi in the Reich’s medicalchain of command, had just been shipped to America under Accelerated Paperclip.There was irony in the fact that the shoes Dr. Blome was about to fill had, forthe past two years and four months, belonged to Major General Dr. WalterSchreiber, the man who had betrayed Dr. Blome in his testimony during the trialof the major war criminals at Nuremberg. The army post outside Frankfurt whereBlome would soon start working was Camp King. McPherson made arrangements withits new commanding officer, Colonel Howard Rupert, to meet the Blomes andarrange for them to have a nice house [endnotes.xhtml#en0998].Blome had been to Camp King before. He had worked for the U.S. government thereon a “special matter” during the Reinhard Gehlen era. When Dr. Blome’s wife,Bettina, learned more about Camp King, she declined the invitation to livethere. She was not interested [endnotes.xhtml#en0999] in having her childrenlive at an American military facility. The couple separated. Dr. Kurt Blomemoved to Camp King alone. On November 30, 1951, McPherson reported: “Dr. Blomeemployed by ECIC effective 3 Dec for 6 months. Contract placed in effect.”Meanwhile, halfway across the world, in the suburbs of San Antonio, Texas, CampKing’s former post physician, Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber, had arrived inthe United States and was working at the School of Aviation Medicine at RandolphAir Force Base (formerly Randolph Field). In addition to his U.S. governmentsalary, Schreiber had recently received a check [endnotes.xhtml#en1000] from theU.S. government in the amount of $16,000—roughly $150,000 in 2013—as asettlement for the alleged lost contents of his former Berlin home. (Schreiberclaimed that the Russians had stolen all his property in retaliation for hisworking for the Americans.) With the money, Schreiber bought a home in SanAntonio and a car [endnotes.xhtml#en1001], and he enrolled his son in the localhigh school. Even Schreiber’s eighty-four-year-old mother-in-law had beenbrought along to live in Texas, courtesy of the United States Air Force. Itcould be said that Dr. Schreiber was living the American dream. But in the fallof 1951 the dream was unexpectedly interrupted by a former war crimesinvestigator named Dr. Leopold Alexander, and a concentration camp survivornamed Janina Iwanska."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEEN [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter018]DOWNFALL [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter018]In the fall of 1951, Dr. Leopold Alexander’s life in Boston had returned tonormal. It had been four years since he had served as an expert consultant tothe secretary of war during the Nuremberg doctors’ trial. Since returning home,Dr. Alexander continued to speak out against medical crimes, nonconsenting humanexperiments, and medicine under totalitarian regimes. He coauthored theNuremberg Code, the set of research principles that now guided physicians aroundthe world. The first principle of the Nuremberg Code was that informed voluntaryconsent was required in absolute terms. Dr. Alexander gave lectures, wrotepapers, and practiced medicine. The doctors’ trial had affected him[endnotes.xhtml#en1002] deeply, as evidenced in nearly five hundred pages ofjournal entries. Whenever the occasion arose, he provided pro bono service tovictims of the Nazi regime.One day in the fall of 1951, Dr. Alexander was contacted by an aid group calledthe International Rescue Office. The group was organizing medical assistance forseveral concentration camp survivors who had been experimented on by Nazidoctors during the war and asked if Dr. Alexander could help. Dr. Alexander inturn contacted his friend and colleague at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, chiefsurgeon Dr. Jacob Fine, and the two men helped arrange for the camp survivors tocome to Massachusetts for medical treatment. One of the women wastwenty-seven-year-old Janina Iwanska, a former prisoner at the Ravensbrückconcentration camp. On November 14, 1951, Iwanska arrived at the Port of NewYork aboard a Greek ocean liner, the SS Neptunia.At the doctors’ trial, Janina Iwanska had delivered much of her testimony withDr. Alexander standing beside her, pointing to her injuries and providing thejudges with a professional medical analysis of what had been done to her by Nazidoctors during the war. Iwanska’s testimony was generally regarded as among themost powerful evidence presented at the trial. At Ravensbrück she had had herlegs broken by Waffen-SS surgeon Dr. Karl Gebhardt and pieces of her shinbonesremoved. Dr. Gebhardt then ordered that Iwanska’s surgical wounds bedeliberately infected with bacteria to cause gangrene, so he could treat themwith sulfa drugs to see if the drugs worked. It was nothing short of a miraclethat Janina Iwanska survived. Now, nine years later, she continued to suffer[endnotes.xhtml#en1003] great physical pain. She walked with a limp because ofthe decimation of her shinbones. The purpose of the trip to the United Stateswas to allow Iwanska to undergo surgery, at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, tohelp alleviate this pain.Dr. Gebhardt had been Major General Dr. Schreiber’s direct subordinate atRavensbrück. Gebhardt had been one of the twenty-three defendants tried at thedoctors’ trial. He was convicted, sentenced to death, and hanged in thecourtyard at Landsberg Prison in June, 1948. Dr. Schreiber was working for theU.S. Air Force in Texas.The same month that Janina Iwanska arrived in the United States, a brief noteappeared in a medical journal stating that a doctor from Germany named WalterSchreiber had just joined the staff of the U.S. Air Force School of AviationMedicine in Texas. As circumstance would have it, Dr. Leopold Alexander was aregular reader of this journal. When he came across Schreiber’s name—familiar ashe was with Dr. Schreiber’s testimony at the Nuremberg trial of the major warcriminals—Alexander was appalled. He wrote to the director of the MassachusettsMedical Society at once. “I regard it as my duty [endnotes.xhtml#en1004] toinform you that the record shows that Dr. Schreiber is a thoroughly undesirableaddition to American Medicine—in fact, an intolerable one,” Alexander explained.“He has been involved as an accessory before and after the fact in the worst ofthe Medical War Crimes which were carried out by the Nazi Government during thewar, and was a key person in perverting the ethical standards of the members ofthe medical profession in Germany during the war.” Dr. Alexander demanded thatDr. Walter Schreiber be barred from practicing medicine in the United States.When he did not get the response he’d expected, he took the matter to the BostonGlobe.It was shortly after 10:30 p.m. on December 8, 1951, in San Antonio, Texas, whenDr. Walter Schreiber heard the telephone ring [endnotes.xhtml#en1005]. He hadbeen in America for three months, and it was an unusual hour for him to receivea phone call. It was not as if Dr. Schreiber was a hospital physician on callwaiting to hear about a sick patient. In his capacity as a research doctor atRandolph Air Force Base, he spent most of his time lecturing about classifiedmatters to a small group of other doctors.Sometimes, he boasted to other doctors about how his area of expertise wasextremely rare [endnotes.xhtml#en1006]. He would tell colleagues that he wasparticularly valuable to the U.S. military because his knowledge was soesoteric. Dr. Schreiber knew everything there was to know about winter warfareand desert warfare. About hygiene and vaccines and bubonic plague. At theofficers’ club at the School of Aviation Medicine, where he gave lectures, hecould be loud and boastful, delivering a highly sanitized version of hiscolorful life. He enjoyed telling long-winded stories [endnotes.xhtml#en1007]about himself: how he had been a prisoner of the Soviets after the fall ofBerlin; how he’d spent years in the notorious Lubyanka prison, in Moscow; howhe’d doctored Field Marshal Paulus in a Russian safe house when Paulus got sick.But what Dr. Schreiber never discussed with anyone at Randolph Air Force Basewas what he did before the fall of Berlin—from 1933 to 1945.Schreiber answered the telephone and was greeted by a man who identified himselfas Mr. Brown [endnotes.xhtml#en1008].“I am calling from the Boston Globe,” Brown said.Mr. Brown did not ask Schreiber his name. Instead, Brown asked if he’d reached“telephone number, 61-210 in San Antonio, Texas.” Dr. Schreiber told Brown thenumber was correct.There was a pause. Later, Dr. Schreiber recalled to military intelligence thathe’d asked Mr. Brown what it was that he wanted at this time of night.“Are you the individual who performed experiments on the bodies of live Polishgirls who were interned in German concentration camps during World War II?”Brown asked.Schreiber told Brown he had never been connected in any way with experiments ofthat nature. “I [have] never worked in a concentration camp,” Schreiber said. “Ihave never in my entire life conducted, ordered, or condoned experiments onhumans of any nationality.”Brown told Schreiber he assumed he’d passed investigations before being broughtto America to conduct secret U.S. Air Force work.“I [have] been thoroughly investigated,” Schreiber said.Brown thanked Schreiber. He said he was just checking up on a story that hadbeen relayed to him by a physician in Boston, Dr. Leo Alexander.Dr. Schreiber hung up the phone. He did not tell anyone [endnotes.xhtml#en1009]that night about the call.The following morning, the Boston Globe published an explosive story with aneye-catching headline: “Ex-Nazi High Post with United States Air Force, saysMedical Man Here.” News reached Texas quickly. Dr. Schreiber was called into theOffice of Special Investigations (OSI) at Randolph Air Force Base to providedetails of the phone call with Mr. Brown the previous evening. Schreiberconfirmed that “during World War II he had held a position in the Wermacht [sic]similar to the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army.” But his story, his struggle,he told the investigating officer, was so much more than that. Schreiber relayedhis capture in Berlin, his life as a prisoner of war in Soviet Russia, and howhe’d “served as a prosecution witness during the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials.”Schreiber explained that owing to “feigned compliance” with the Russians he’dbeen “awarded a high position with the East German Politzei [sic].” Instead oftaking that job he’d escaped. Schreiber lied to the Office of SpecialInvestigations and said that he had met Dr. Leo Alexander at Nuremberg. That hehad been “given a clean bill of health by [Doctor] Alexander” himself.Schreiber told the air force investigator he was certain that the Russians werebehind all of this. He had recently written a manuscript called “Behind the IronCurtain,” Schreiber said, and while he hadn’t found a publisher yet, he believedthat the Russians had gotten hold of a copy of it. “He was of the opinion[endnotes.xhtml#en1010] that [Soviet Intelligence] is perhaps attempting toslander him by implying that he was engaged in atrocious experiments on humansubjects,” the investigating officer wrote in his report. Schreiber’s fullstatement was forwarded to air force headquarters. The security officers atRandolph Air Force Base did not have the kind of clearance that allowed themaccess to Dr. Schreiber’s JIOA file or his OMGUS security report. They had noidea who Schreiber really was. They most certainly had not been made aware thathe was a Nazi ideologue and the former surgeon general of the Third Reich. Allanyone at the School of Aviation Medicine would have known was that he was aGerman scientist who was part of Operation Paperclip. The facility had alreadyemployed thirty-four German scientists.On December 14, the FBI got involved [endnotes.xhtml#en1011] in the case. Dr.Leopold Alexander, Schreiber’s accuser in Boston, was an internationallyrenowned authority on medical crimes. His allegations had to be taken seriously.But the air force was unwilling to give up Dr. Schreiber right away. To garnersupport for him, a memo classified Secret was circulated among those involved,heralding the “Professional and Personal Qualifications of Dr. WalterSchreiber.” The memo stated, “He possesses an analytical mind, criticaljudgment, objectivity, and a wealth of well detailed, exact information.”Schreiber possessed “know how on preventative health measures, military andcivilian, under conditions of total war.” He had “detailed information ofmedical problems in connection with desert and ‘Arctic’ warfare,” and had“contributed to Zeiss Atlas of Epidemology” [sic]. He’d been “a ‘key’ prisonerof war in Russia for three and a half years [and] he is in a position to provideauthoritative information and serve as a consultant on vitally important medicalmatters in Russia.”With public outrage brewing over the Globe article, the situation escalatedquickly. The Pentagon became involved, and the matter was sent to the office ofthe surgeon general of the United States Air Force. That position was now heldby none other than Harry Armstrong, recently promoted to major general.Armstrong knew the situation could very quickly get out of control. And hardlyanyone had more to lose, personally and professionally, than he did. With theassistance of Dr. Hubertus Strughold, Harry Armstrong had personally recruitedfifty-eight former Nazi doctors for work at the U.S. Army Air Forces AeroMedical Center in Heidelberg, five of whom had been arrested for war crimes,four of whom were tried at Nuremberg, two of whom were convicted at Nuremberg,and one of whom was acquitted and then rehired by the U.S. Air Force to work inAmerica before being revealed as incompetent and fired. That said nothing of thethirty-four doctors who had since been hired to work at the School of AviationMedicine, many of whom were Nazi ideologues as well as former members of the SSand the SA. The Schreiber scandal could trigger a domino effect, shining anunwanted spotlight on the highly suspicious backgrounds of Dr. Strughold, Dr.Benzinger, Dr. Konrad Schäfer, Dr. Becker-Freyseng, Dr. Schröder, Dr. Ruff, andso many others.Major General Harry Armstrong wrote to the director of intelligence of the airforce regarding Major General Dr. Schreiber. “I have been advised[endnotes.xhtml#en1012] by the Commandant, USAF School of Aviation Medicine,Randolph Air Force Base, Texas, that they recently forwarded to your office arequest for a new contract [for] Doctor Walter Schreiber until June 1952,”Armstrong wrote. “Recent information indicated that Doctor Schreiber may havebeen implicated in the medical war crimes in Germany during World War II, andhis presence in this country has aroused a considerable amount of criticism. Asa consequence of this, it is the firm opinion of this office that the Air ForceMedical Service cannot associate itself with Doctor Schreiber beyond the sixmonths’ contract under which he is now employed.” Further, said Armstrong, “itmay be advisable to terminate this contract even prior to its expiration.”Armstrong promised that the commandant of the School of Aviation Medicine, MajorGeneral Otis Benson, “concurs with this recommendation.” General Benson hadequal reason to want the Schreiber scandal to quietly disappear. After the war,Benson had served as technical supervisor of the German scientists working atthe Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center in Heidelberg.Two weeks after the scandal broke, Dr. Schreiber was informed that his contractwould not be renewed. General Benson delivered the news in person. According toSchreiber, Benson also proposed a secret, alternative plan involving Schreiber’sfuture career in America. In an affidavit, Schreiber swore that General Benson“stated [endnotes.xhtml#en1013] that he felt sure my services could be utilizedin other branches of the government or in medical schools, and offered hisassistance in soliciting for a position for me.”In Boston, the matter continued to generate press. The Janina Iwanska story wasnews people were interested in reading about. Despite what had been done to herduring the war, Janina Iwanska was a vibrant, beautiful, credible young woman;it was almost impossible not to marvel at her resilience. After being liberatedfrom Ravensbrück, she had moved to Paris, where she had been working as ajournalist for Radio Free Europe. She also worked as the Paris-basedcorrespondent for several Polish newspapers in Western Europe.When Iwanska was experimented on at Ravensbrück she was only seventeen yearsold. While imprisoned there, she and several other female prisoners had takenremarkable steps to get word outside the camp about what was being done by Nazidoctors at Ravensbrück. With the goal of getting their message to the Vatican,the BBC, and the International Red Cross, Iwanska and four other women sentsecret messages [endnotes.xhtml#en1014] to their relatives outside the camp.Remarkably, a French prisoner named Germaine Tillion took photographs of thewomen’s wounds, then smuggled a roll of film out of the camp. The story wasprinted in the Polish underground press during the war, notifying the worldabout the Ravensbrück medical experiments. The story was eventually picked up bythe BBC, as the women had hoped.Now, with the Schreiber story gaining momentum, in January 1951, FBI agentsarranged to interview [endnotes.xhtml#en1015] Janina Iwanska in Boston. Underoath and from a photograph, she identified Dr. Schreiber as a high-rankingdoctor who had overseen the medical experiments at Ravensbrück.“How do you know that the Dr. Schreiber, whom you saw in the Concentration Campin Germany in 1942 and 1943, is the same Dr. Walter Schreiber who is now in SanAntonio?” an FBI agent asked her.“Three weeks ago, the journalist was coming from the Boston Post [sic] and theyshowed me about fifty (50) pictures and they asked me if I know [which one] isDr. Schreiber,” Iwanska said. She described how she had no trouble pickingSchreiber’s photograph out of fifty presented to her. “I saw this face in thedoctors’ group in Ravensbrück,” she said. “After, they asked me if I knewSchreiber’s name. I told them, ‘I know Schreiber’s name.’ ”Dr. Schreiber, in a separate interview, claimed that he had had nothing to dowith the Ravensbrück experiments, that he had never even visited a concentrationcamp, and that he had never met Janina Iwanska, who was accusing him ofoutrageous acts. In response, Janina Iwanska had this to say: “I had anoperation done on my legs by Dr. Gebhart [sic].… During the first dressing afterthe operations I spoke to him. I asked Dr. Gebhart why they did the operationand they gave the answer, ‘We can do the experiment because you are condemned todie.’ The number [tattooed on] my legs are T. K. M. III. If Dr. Schreiber cannotremember my name, I am sure perhaps he can remember the experiment [number].”Janina Iwanska said she was sure that Dr. Schreiber was at the concentrationcamp; she had seen him with her own eyes. After operations were performed onseventy-four women, she explained, there was a doctors’ conference at theconcentration camp.“Were you present at the Doctors’ Conference?” the FBI agent asked.“Yes, because every woman who had the experiment was taken in the [conference]room and Gebhart explained to the other doctors what he did.”“Do you remember the date of this conference by Dr. Gebhart and Dr. Schreiberabout your experiment?”“I think it was about three weeks after the [operation of] 15th of August 1942,”Janina Iwanska said.“Did any of the people who were experimented on die as a result of theexperiments?”“Yes. Five died 48 hours after the operation, and six were shot after theoperation,” Iwanska said.“Do you know the names of those who died as a result of the operation?”“I have the list at my house. I sent the names to the United Nations. They haveall the documents. It was seventy-four who had the experiment.”“Do you have any knowledge as to whether Dr. Schreiber ordered these experimentsdone?”“I don’t know if he gave the orders [endnotes.xhtml#en1016]. Only I know he wasvery interested in it,” she said.Back in Texas, Dr. Schreiber began plotting [endnotes.xhtml#en1017] his escapeto Argentina. He wrote to his married daughter, Elisabeth van der Fecht, who wasliving in San Isidro, in Buenos Aires. He asked her to get information about howhe could get a visa fast. The FBI intercepted Schreiber’s mail.“I will be able to get a visa for you all within fourteen days,” promisedSchreiber’s daughter. “To be honest, we always have feared something similar tocome.… Everything started so well and seemed to be wonderful. Your nice house,your new furniture.…” She assured her father that she could help get thepaperwork necessary to enter Argentina. “If, father, you wish us to take steps,send us the necessary documents,” Elisabeth wrote. “Anyhow the risk would bemuch less than if you must go to Germany. For Heaven’s sake do not go back.”By mid-January, the JIOA weighed in. The Joint Chiefs decided that it wasnecessary to repatriate Dr. Schreiber. “Reason for Requesting Repatriation: Dr.Schreiber is basically not a research scientist, and as such his usefulness isvery limited to the School of Aviation Medicine,” a memo read. “Recent criticismand adverse publicity [have] been directed against the School of AviationMedicine in that it has been charged that Dr. Schreiber, as a high ranking NaziMedical Officer, was connected with brutal experiments on concentration campvictims. The School of Aviation Medicine and the Surgeon General do not wish toassume responsibility for Schreiber… in view of the above criticism.”Army headquarters in Heidelberg, Germany, disagreed. On February 5, 1952, thearmy cabled a message marked “Secret” to JIOA, written in shorthand. “Recommendtake act[ion] to retain Schreiber in US. Subj has invaluable info ofintelligence nature regarding Russia and is outstanding [in] his professionalfield.”The Office of the U.S. High Commissioner weighed in: “All reparations of paperclip personnel unless voluntary have some adverse effect [on] JIOA programs,” amemo stated. “Request coordinate with G2 Army prior to final decision onrepatriation.” At air force headquarters, another idea was gaining support. Whynot help Dr. Schreiber “move” to Argentina? To this end, a major named D. A.Roe, from Army Intelligence, G-2, contacted Argentinean General Aristobulo FidelReyes to discuss “the utilization of the services of Dr. Walter Paul Schreiber,M.D.” Major Roe queried if “in any way possible… his talents could be used inArgentina.” The army had originally intended to allow the talented Dr. Schreiberto immigrate to the United States, Major Roe explained, but, unfortunately, thathad changed. “His admissibility, under current law, as an immigrate [sic] of theU.S. is questionable because of this close affiliation with the Nazi Army,”Major Roe clarified. Argentina did not have the same kinds of immigration lawsprohibiting entry of former high-ranking Nazis. It would be great if they couldhelp.Faced with pushback from High Commissioner John J. McCloy, JIOA retooled itsrepatriation position and instead made a case for extending Dr. Schreiber’sstay. “Schreiber family may be subjected to reprisals due to his previouslyreported escape from Russian control,” JIOA wrote. “If repatriation isinadvisable believe Schreiber may be retained here by issuance of visa. Above isadditional reason for desirability of entry with immigration visa.” But then anew document emerged, marked JIOA eyes only, and to be kept in Schreiber’sclassified dossier. Schreiber’s wife of forty years [endnotes.xhtml#en1018],Olga, was also an old-time Nazi. According to official NSDAP paperwork, she hadjoined the Nazi Party on October 1, 1931, years before Hitler came to power.Each week that passed brought more focus to the subject. The public was growingincreasingly outraged with the notion that an ex-Nazi general and alleged warcriminal was still living in the United States, and that his employment by theUnited States Air Force was still up in the air.The Physicians Forum, a group of doctors representing thirty-six states, wroteto the Senate. “Had Dr. Schreiber been found and apprehended at the time of theNuremberg Military Tribunal,” the doctors wrote, “it is virtually certain thathe would have been brought to trial along with his associates many of whom weresentenced to life imprisonment or hanged for their crimes. Instead thisindividual is now in the United States working for our Air Force.” Thephysicians unanimously recommended “[i]mmediate expulsion of Dr. Schreiber fromthe United States [and] a thorough investigation of the circumstances leading toDr. Schreiber’s entry into this country and his assignment to the Air Force.”The final demand was far more threatening to the air force than the PhysiciansForum doctors could have known. Were the Senate to hold hearings to investigate“similar appointments of German physicians formerly in important positions inthe German armed forces during World War II,” the whole Paperclip program couldbe revealed. Heads would roll. Schreiber’s story could travel all the way up tothe Joint Chiefs of Staff, the scandal all the way to the president of theUnited States.With an astonishing degree of hubris, Dr. Schreiber gave one media interviewafter the next, professing innocence and calling all the charges against him“lies.”“I am not fighting for a renewal of my contract,” Schreiber told the WashingtonPost, “I am fighting for justice [endnotes.xhtml#en1019], and I will continue todo so as long as I live.” He issued an egregiously false statement, declaring,“I never was a member of the staff of the supreme command of the Wehrmacht.” Inanother interview, he said, “I never worked in a concentration camp[endnotes.xhtml#en1020].” Later in the interview he clarified that he hadactually “visited” a camp once, in eastern Pomerania, without knowing it was aconcentration camp. His very brief job there was to inspect “a report for thedelousing treatment,” for a group of girls whose “linen was disinfected withDDT,” Schreiber said. “After I arrived there, four days later, the girls werefound clean and free of lice,” Schreiber said.Dr. Schreiber had the air force and the Joint Chiefs of Staff over a barrel, andhe likely knew it. If any one of these high-ranking U.S. government officialswas forced to admit what was really known about Schreiber—what had been knownall along—it would be a scandal of the first degree. Instead, the lie wasallowed to expand. “Until we come up with some basic facts,” JIOA directorColonel Benjamin W. Heckemeyer told Time magazine, in an exclusive sit-downinterview with a reporter named Miss Moran, “a man should be given[endnotes.xhtml#en1021] the all-American treatment here and not be given thebum’s rush.”Behind the scenes, Harry Armstrong, surgeon general of the air force, had beenspearheading Schreiber’s removal. But in statements to the press, he maintaineda façade of support. There is “no evidence he’s guilty other than serving hiscountry during war same as I did mine,” General Armstrong told the AssociatedPress. Legendary newspaper columnist Drew Pearson did not see things in the samelight. He pulled transcripts from the Nuremberg doctors’ trial and quoted fromthem in “Washington Merry-Go-Round.” “Here are the facts regarding the Nazidoctor [endnotes.xhtml#en1022] who escaped the Nuremberg war crimes trials andis now working for the Air Force at Randolph Field, Texas,” Pearson wrote,“kicking, screaming young Polish girls were held down by SS troops and forciblyoperated on.… Nuremberg document No. 619 also shows that Schreiber was second ona list of prominent medical officers detached to the SS for two days.… Humanvictims were also used in typhus experiments at Buchenwald and Natzweilerconcentration camps. Deadly virus was transferred from men to mice and back inan attempt to produce live vaccine.” Schreiber responded by saying, “TheNuremberg Military Tribunal has prosecuted and held those responsible for thecrimes.”That statement further incensed Dr. Leo Alexander and Boston attorney AlexanderHardy, the former chief prosecutor at the doctors’ trial. The two men drafted aten-page letter to President Truman [endnotes.xhtml#en1023]. “He was not adefendant [but] beyond a doubt he is responsible for medical crimes,” Hardy andAlexander explained. “He certainly had full knowledge that concentration campinmates were being systematically experimented on by doctors of the MedicalService in which he was a General.… Schreiber’s subordinates performedexperiments encouraged by Schreiber,” who in turn made “materials and fundsavailable [and] the holding of conferences.”Hardy and Alexander cited testimony from five of Schreiber’sphysician-colleagues who testified at the Nuremberg doctors’ trial thatSchreiber had overseen a host of “hygiene”-related Reich medical programs inwhich countless humans were sacrificed in the name of research. Included weredetails of yellow fever experiments, epidemic jaundice experiments,sulfanilamide experiments, euthanasia by phenol experiments and the notorioustyphus vaccine program “with its 90% death rate.” Alexander Hardy and Dr.Alexander’s letter to President Truman portrayed Major General Dr. WalterSchreiber not only as a war criminal of the worst order but as a sadist and aliar. Parts of the letter were made public. “Truman Is Urged to ExpelPhysician,” read a headline in the New York Times. Harry Armstrong wrote to thePhysicians Forum assuring them that Schreiber would be returned to Germany atonce.JIOA director Colonel Heckemeyer was asked by Time magazine what the air forcewas going to do if, after completing its investigation, it found Dr. Schreiberguilty of war crimes. “That I will have to get guidance from the Office of theSecretary of Defense on,” Heckemeyer said. Could Schreiber be prosecuted, theTime reporter asked?“We are not going to make [endnotes.xhtml#en1024] a Nuernberg [sic] trial threeyears after the trials are closed,” Heckemeyer said. Finally, the secretary ofthe air force, Thomas Finletter, made a public announcement stating that Dr.Schreiber would be dropped from his contract and put under military custody. Hewould leave the United States at once.But Dr. Schreiber refused to leave the United States. Instead, he packed up hisfamily, left Texas, and drove to San Francisco. There, the Schreibers moved inwith Dorothea, the couple’s married daughter, and her husband, William Fry, intheir home at 35 Ridge Road, in San Anselmo. Just as Dorothea had worked at CampKing when her father was post surgeon there, her new husband, William Fry, hadserved at Camp King, as an army intelligence investigator. Having moved toAmerica in July 1951, the two had lived in California since.More than a month passed. The Physicians Forum received new information aboutSchreiber, which they submitted to President Truman on April 24, 1952, alongwith a telegram marked “Urgent.” They attached a document that showed thatBrigadier General Otis Benson, commanding general at Randolph Field School ofAviation Medicine, “sought continued employment for Dr. Schreiber in the UnitedStates, preferably a ‘University Appointment,’ ” after the air force had alreadypromised that Schreiber would soon be leaving the United States.The outrageous part, said the physicians, was that the U.S. Air Force wascolluding to keep Schreiber in the United States. In their letter to PresidentTruman, they quoted General Benson from a letter he’d written to the dean of theMinnesota School of Public Health, seeking a new job for Schreiber in theprivate sector. “I like and respect the man [but] he is too hot for me to keephere using public funds,” General Benson said of Schreiber. He said that the badpress had been little more than “an organized medical movement against himemanating from Boston by medical men of Jewish ancestry.” The Physicians Forum’sboard of directors demanded that President Truman order the attorney general toopen an investigation into the case.A few days later, a lieutenant colonel named G. A. Little, representing theJoint Chiefs of Staff, flew to California to visit with Dr. Schreiber at hisdaughter’s house, “for the purpose of attempting to persuade Dr. Schreiber to goto Buenos Aires at once, regardless of job opportunities which might or mightnot be developed through [our] office.” According to Little, the visit wentwell.“We were very cordially received by Dr. Schreiber and spent approximately twohours in conversation with him,” Lieutenant Colonel G. A. Little wrote in aconfidential report for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In exchange for“transportation to South America” and “funds for travel,” and “travel allowancefor Schreiber Family Group,” Dr. Schreiber agreed to leave the United States atonce. “Schreiber’s voluntary and immediate departure for Buenos Aires willprovide a satisfactory solution for all concerned.” The amount Schreiber waspaid to leave was never disclosed and is not mentioned in his declassifiedOperation Paperclip file.On May 22, 1952, Dr. Schreiber and his family were flown by military aircraftfrom Travis Air Force Base, in California, to New Orleans, Louisiana. There,they boarded a ship bound for Argentina. When they arrived in Buenos Aires, theywere taken by car to the American consulate and given documents that allowedthem to stay. The arrangements were made by General Aristobulo Fidel Reyes[endnotes.xhtml#en1025]. The air force paid for police protection[endnotes.xhtml#en1026] for Dr. Schreiber and his family during the transition.It was important that the Schreibers’ resettlement in South America go smoothly.There were too many American officials whose reputations would never survive ifthe facts were revealed.The Senate hearings never happened, and the attorney general never opened acase. In Argentina, Dr. Schreiber bought a home and named it Sans Souci(“without a care”), the name of the summer palace in Potsdam, outside Berlin, ofFrederick the Great, king of Prussia. According to personal family documents,Schreiber’s final quest was to prove that he had been born a baron and wasdescended from Prussian royalty. “As a consequence of what the officialinvestigation turned up, in addition to his own extraordinary meritoriousachievements,” say the family documents [endnotes.xhtml#en1027], “Oberstabsarzt[Military Medical Doctor] Walter P. Schreiber was given ‘official’ permission toadd ‘von’ to his name.” The personal papers do not say who gave this officialpermission. Schreiber died in September 1970 in San Carlos de Bariloche, RíoNegro, Argentina."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETEEN [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter019]TRUTH SERUM [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter019]As Dr. Schreiber sailed for Argentina, the Operation Bluebird interrogationprogram at Camp King expanded to include “the use of drugs and chemicals[endnotes.xhtml#en1028] in unconventional interrogation.” Dr. Kurt Blome wasCamp King’s post doctor during this period. According to a memo in hisdeclassified foreign scientist case file, Blome worked on “Army, 1952, Project1975,” a Top Secret project that itself has never been declassified. Blome’sfile [endnotes.xhtml#en1029] becomes empty after that.“Bluebird was rechristened [endnotes.xhtml#en1030] Artichoke,” writes JohnMarks, a former State Department official and authority on the CIA’s mindcontrol programs. The goal of the Artichoke interrogation program, Marksexplains, was “modifying behavior through covert means [endnotes.xhtml#en1031].”According to the program’s administrator, Richard Helms—the future director ofthe CIA—using drugs was a means to that end. “We felt that it was ourresponsibility [endnotes.xhtml#en1032] not to lag behind the Russians or theChinese in this field, and the only way to find out what the risks were was totest things such as LSD and other drugs that could be used to control humanbehavior,” Helms told journalist David Frost, in an interview in 1978. OtherU.S. intelligence agencies were brought on board to help conduct thesecontroversial interrogation experiments. “In 1951 the CIA Director approved theliaison with Army, Navy, and Air Force intelligence to avoid duplication ofeffort [endnotes.xhtml#en1033],” writes Marks. “The Army and Navy were bothlooking for truth drugs while the prime concern of the Air Force wasinterrogation techniques used on downed pilots.” Since the end of the war, thevarious U.S. military branches had developed advanced air, land, and sea rescueprograms, based in part on research conducted by Nazi doctors. But the Sovietshad also made great advances in rescue programs and this presented a serious newconcern. If a downed U.S. pilot or soldier was rescued by the Russians, thatperson would almost certainly be subjected to unconventional interrogationtechniques, according to the CIA. The purpose of Operation Bluebird was to tryto predict what kinds of methods the Soviets might use against American soldiersand airmen. One of the so-called truth serum drugs the CIA believed the Sovietswere most heavily involved in researching was LSD. One CIA report, later sharedwith Congress, stated that “the Soviets purchased a large quantity of LSD-25from the Sandoz Company… reputed to be sufficient for 50 million doses[endnotes.xhtml#en1034].” Or so the CIA thought. A later analysis of theinformation determined that the CIA analyst working on the report made a decimalpoint error while performing dosage calculations. The Soviets had in factpurchased enough LSD from Sandoz for a few thousand tests—a far cry from fiftymillion.For its Operation Bluebird experiments involving LSD and other drugs, the CIAteamed up with the Army Chemical Corps. The initial research and development wasconducted by officers with the Special Operations Division who worked inside aclassified facility designated Building No. 439, a one-story concrete-blockbuilding set among similar-looking buildings at Camp Detrick so as to blend in.Almost no one outside the SO Division [endnotes.xhtml#en1035] knew about the TopSecret work going on inside. The SO Division was paid for by the CIA’s TechnicalServices Staff (TSS), a unit within the CIA’s Clandestine Service; many of itsfield agents were culled from a pool of senior bacteriologists at Detrick. Oneof these SO Division field agents was Dr. Harold Batchelor, the man behind theEight Ball who consulted with Dr. Kurt Blome in Heidelberg in 1947. Another SODivision agent was Dr. Frank Olson, a former army officer and bacteriologistturned Agency operative whose sudden demise in 1953 would nearly bring down theCIA. The two men were assigned to the program at Camp King involvingunconventional interrogation techniques.In April 1950, Frank Olson was issued a diplomatic passport. Olson was not adiplomat; the passport allowed him to carry items in a diplomatic pouch thatwould not be subject to searches by customs officials. Frank Olson began takingtrips to Germany, flying to Frankfurt and making the short drive out to CampKing. In one of the rare surviving official documents from the program, DeputyDirector of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles sent a secret memo to RichardHelms [endnotes.xhtml#en1036] and CIA Deputy Director for Plans Frank Wisnerregarding the specific kinds of interrogation techniques that would be used. “Inour conversation of 9 February 1951, I outlined to you the possibilities ofaugmenting the usual interrogation methods by the use of drugs, hypnosis, shock,etc., and emphasized the defensive aspects as well as the offensiveopportunities in this field of applied medical science,” wrote Dulles. “Theenclosed folder, ‘Interrogation Techniques,’ [endnotes.xhtml#en1037] wasprepared in my Medical Division to provide you with a suitable background.” CampKing was the perfect location to conduct these trials. Overseas locations werepreferred for Artichoke interrogations, since foreign governments[endnotes.xhtml#en1038] “permitted certain activities which were not permittedby the United States government (i.e. anthrax etc.).”The next trip on record made by Frank Olson occurred on June 12, 1952. Olsonarrived at Frankfurt from the Hendon military airport in England and made theshort drive west into Oberursel. There, Artichoke interrogation experiments weretaking place at a safe house called Haus Waldorf [endnotes.xhtml#en1039].“Between 4 June 1952 and 18 June 1952 [endnotes.xhtml#en1040], an IS&O [CIAInspection and Security Office] team… applied Artichoke techniques to twooperational cases in a safe house,” explains an Artichoke memorandum, writtenfor CIA director Dulles, and one of the few action memos on record not destroyedby Richard Helms when he was CIA director. The two individuals beinginterrogated at the Camp King safe house “could be classed as experienced,professional type agents and suspected of working for Soviet Intelligence.”These were Soviet spies captured by the Gehlen Organization, now being run bythe CIA. “In the first case, light dosages of drugs coupled with hypnosis wereused to induce a complete hypnotic trance,” the memo reveals. “This trance washeld for approximately one hour and forty minutes of interrogation with asubsequent total amnesia produced.” The plan was straightforward: drug thespies, interrogate the spies, and give them amnesia to make them forget[endnotes.xhtml#en1041].Another surviving memo from this otherwise unreported chapter of Cold Warhistory is from Dr. Henry Knowles Beecher, chief anesthetist at MassachusettsGeneral Hospital in Boston and a CIA-army-navy adviser on Artichoke techniques.Beecher traveled to Germany to observe what was happening at Camp King. He was acolleague of Dr. Leopold Alexander’s in Boston and, like Alexander, was anoutspoken advocate of the Nuremberg Code, the first principle of which isinformed consent. And yet in one of the stranger Cold War cases ofdissimulation, Dr. Beecher was a participant in secret, government-sponsoredmedical experiments that did not involve consent. Beecher was paid by the CIA[endnotes.xhtml#en1042] and the navy to consult on how best to produce amnesiain Soviet spies after they were drugged and interrogated so they would forgetwhat had been done to them.Dr. Frank Olson returned from Germany to his office in Detrick in a moral bind,according to his Detrick colleague the bacteriologist Norman Cournoyer. “He hada tough time after Germany [endnotes.xhtml#en1043]… [d]rugs, torture,brainwashing,” Cournoyer explained decades later, for a documentary for Germantelevision made in 2001. Cournoyer said that Olson felt ashamed about what hehad witnessed, and that the experiments at Camp King reminded him of what hadbeen done to people in concentration camps. Back in America, Olson contemplatedleaving his job. He told family members he was considering a new career, as adentist. Instead, he stayed on at the bioweapons facility, becoming chief of theSO Division for a while. He continued to work on Top Secret biological andchemical weapons programs in the CIA’s office at Detrick, Building No. 439.Unknown to Frank Olson, the CIA was expanding its Artichoke program[endnotes.xhtml#en1044] in new ways, including expanding its use of LSD in“unconventional interrogations” through covert means. Strapping a suspectedSoviet spy to a chair and dosing him with drugs, as was done at Camp King’s HausWaldorf, was one approach to getting a spy to spill his secrets. But the CIAwondered what would happen if an enemy agent were to be given an incapacitatingagent like LSD on the sly, without knowing he had been drugged. Would this kindof amnesia be effective? Could it produce loyalty? How much, if any, of theexperience would be remembered? These were questions the CIA wanted answered.The director of the Technical Services Staff, Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, a stuttererwith a club foot, decided that the first field tests should be conducted on menfrom the SO Division without them knowing about it. One of those targeted forexperimentation was Dr. Frank Olson.A week before Thanksgiving, in November 1953, six SO Division agents includingFrank Olson and the new SO Division chief, Vincent Ruwet, were invited to aweekend retreat at a CIA safe house in western Maryland called Deep Creek Lake.There, the men from Detrick were met by TSS director Sidney Gottlieb and hisdeputy, Robert Lashbrook, a chemist. One part of the agenda was to discuss thelatest covert means of poisoning people with biological agents and toxicsubstances, including those that had been acquired from around the globe byFritz Hoffmann, the Operation Paperclip scientist with the Chemical Corps. Thesecond goal was to covertly dose the six SO Division men with LSD and recordwhat happened. After dinner on the second night, Robert Lashbrook secretly addedLSD to a bottle of Cointreau. The unwitting test subjects were all offered adrink, and all but two of the SO Division officers drank the aperitif; one had aheart condition and the other abstained from alcohol. Frank Olson had a terriblereaction to having been drugged with LSD. He became psychologically unstable andcould not sleep. His boss, Vincent Ruwet, who had also been dosed, described hisown LSD poisoning experience as “the most frightening experience[endnotes.xhtml#en1045] I ever had or hope to have.” The CIA had at least one oftheir questions answered now; covert LSD poisoning did not produce amnesia.When Monday morning came around, Ruwet arrived for work at 7:30, as usual.Inside Detrick’s Building No. 439 he found a very agitated Dr. Frank Olsonwaiting for him. Olson told Ruwet that he was devastated by what had happened atDeep Creek Lake. He wanted to quit or be fired. Ruwet told him to give the issuesome time and to get back to work. But when Ruwet arrived for work the followingmorning at 7:30, he again found Frank Olson waiting for him. Olson’s mentalstate had deteriorated considerably, and Ruwet decided that he needed medicalhelp. He called Agency headquarters, in Washington, D.C., and told RobertLashbrook what was going on. Frank Olson was privy to the CIA’s mostcontroversial behavior modification and mind control programs. If he had apsychotic break in public he could inadvertently talk—terribly ironic, sincegetting a man to spill his secrets was what this LSD poisoning program was allabout. Were Frank Olson to talk, the Agency would have a nightmare on its hands.“Dr. Olson was in serious trouble [endnotes.xhtml#en1046] and needed immediateprofessional attention,” Lashbrook wrote in an after-incident CIA report.Lashbrook told Vincent Ruwet to bring Olson to headquarters immediately. Fromthere, the two men took Olson to a townhouse in New York City, at 133 EastFifty-eighth Street. There, Olson met with a doctor on the CIA’s payroll namedHarold Abramson. Abramson was not a psychiatrist. He was an allergist andimmunologist who worked on LSD tolerance experiments [endnotes.xhtml#en1047] forthe CIA, and he carried a Secret clearance of his own. Frank Olson told Dr.Abramson that he was suffering from memory loss, confusion, feelings ofinadequacy, and terrible guilt. Dr. Abramson noted that Olson seemed to have aperfectly good memory and could remember people, places, and events easily ondemand. In other words, Frank Olson’s problems were all in his mind[endnotes.xhtml#en1048].The next morning, Robert Lashbrook and Vincent Ruwet took Frank Olson on anothervisit, to another CIA contract employee, John Mulholland, a semifamous New YorkCity magician. Like Dr. Abramson, magician John Mulholland had a Secret securityclearance with the TSS. Mulholland taught CIA agents how to apply “themagician’s art to covert activities.” One of his specialties was “the deliveryof various materials [endnotes.xhtml#en1049] to unwitting subjects.” During thevisit, Olson became suspicious [endnotes.xhtml#en1050] of what was going on andasked to leave. By the next day, Frank Olson was hearing voices. He told Dr.Abramson that the CIA was trying to poison him, which they already had done atleast once. Vincent Ruwet returned to Maryland to be with his family forThanksgiving; Abramson and Lashbrook decided to have Frank Olson committed tothe Chestnut Lodge sanitarium, in Rockville, Maryland. Conveniently, the CIA haddoctors on staff there.Robert Lashbrook and Frank Olson spent one last night in New York City, in theStatler Hotel, on Seventh Avenue and Thirty-third Street. They were given room1018A [endnotes.xhtml#en1051], on the tenth floor. After eating in the hotelrestaurant, Olson and Lashbrook returned to their room to have a drink and watchtelevision. Olson called his wife for the first time since he had left home andtold her not to worry—that he’d be home soon. Then he went to sleep.At approximately 2:30 a.m. Olson crashed through the hotel window and fell morethan one hundred feet to his death on the street below. According to thecoroner’s report, Olson hit the ground feet first, as if standing up, fellbackward, and broke his skull. The Statler Hotel night manager, Armand Pastore,heard the impact and ran outside. He found Olson lying on the pavement, stillalive. His eyes were open, Pastore told the police, and he tried to saysomething. But no words came out, and after a few moments, Frank Olson took hislast breath.Pastore looked up to see which room Olson had come out of. He could see that oneof the window shades in a room high above was sticking out, as if the shade hadbeen down when Olson crashed through it. Pastore noted which room it might be.When the police arrived, he took them up to the tenth floor and into room 1018A,using the manager’s passkey to get inside. There, inside the bathroom, CIA agentRobert Lashbrook sat on the toilet seat in his underwear, holding his head inhis hands. Lashbrook had already made two telephone calls. The first call was tothe CIA’s director of the Technical Services Staff, Sidney Gottlieb, the man whohad, with Lashbrook, poisoned Frank Olson with LSD a little over a week before.The second call was to the hotel’s front desk, to report Olson’s suicide. WhenNew York City Police detective James W. Ward arrived on the scene, he askedRobert Lashbrook several questions, to which Lashbrook responded using only thewords “yes” and “no.” Lashbrook did not identify himself as a CIA agent.Dr. Lashbrook was taken in for questioning; homicide had not yet been ruled out.At the precinct, Detective Ward asked Lashbrook to empty his pockets[endnotes.xhtml#en1052]. Among the contents were papers with addresses for Dr.Harold Abramson, in New York City, and the Chestnut Lodge sanitarium, inRockville, Maryland. When asked about his profession, Lashbrook told DetectiveWard that he was a chemist with the War Department and that Frank Olson was ascientist at Camp Detrick—and that Olson was mentally ill. Detective Ward calledDr. Abramson, who verified Lashbrook’s story, leaving out that he also workedfor the CIA.Two days later, Detective Ward submitted Case Number 125124 to his stationchief. The death of Frank Olson was determined to be a suicide. The case wasclosed.If the Greek philosopher Heraclitus is right and war is the father of allthings, then America’s Nazi scientist program was a nefarious child of theSecond World War. Operation Paperclip in turn created a host of monstrousoffspring, including Operations Bluebird, Artichoke, and MKUltra. Before FrankOlson became involved in the CIA’s poisoning and interrogation programs, heconducted research and development of the airborne delivery of biologicalweapons. Olson had been working in the field of biological weapons researchsince 1943. He was recruited by Detrick’s first director, Ira Baldwin, duringthe war. After the war, Dr. Olson became a civilian scientist at Detrick. Hejoined the Special Operations Division in 1950 and was part of a team thatcovertly tested how a weaponized biological agent might disperse if used againstAmericans.In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Olson had traveled across the United Statesoverseeing field tests that dispersed biological agents from aircraft and cropdusters [endnotes.xhtml#en1053] in San Francisco, the Midwest, and Alaska. Somefield tests involved harmless simulants and others involved dangerous pathogens,as Senate hearings later revealed [endnotes.xhtml#en1054]. One such dangerousexperiment was conducted by Olson and his Detrick colleague Norman Cournoyer.The two men went to Alaska and oversaw bacteria being sprayed out of airplanesto see how the pathogens would disperse in an environment similar to that of aharsh Russian winter. “We used a spore, [endnotes.xhtml#en1055]” Cournoyerexplained, “which is very similar [to] anthrax, so to that extent we didsomething that was not kosher. Because we picked it up all over [the UnitedStates] months after we did the tests.” A third man involved in the covert testswith Cournoyer and Olson was Dr. Harold Batchelor, the bacteriologist wholearned airborne spray techniques from Dr. Kurt Blome, whom Batchelor consultedwith in Heidelberg. Olson and Batchelor also conducted covert field tests inclosed spaces across America, including in subways and in the Pentagon. Forthese tests, the Special Operations Division used a relatively harmless pathogenthat simulated how a deadly pathogen would disperse. A congressional inquiryinto these covert tests found them “appalling” in their deception.By being part of a team of covert poisoners, be it out in the Alaskan tundra orinside a safe house at Camp King in Germany, Dr. Frank Olson and his colleaguesviolated the Nuremberg Code, which requires informed consent. As circumstanceswould have it, the great tragedy of Frank Olson’s life and death was that hisown inalienable right to be protected from harm from his government and hisdoctor was violated on orders from the very same people to whom he had dedicatedhis life’s work.This new war, the Cold War, was now the father of its own dark events."},{"pageContent":"PART V [toc.xhtml#toc-part005]“War is the father of all things.”—Heraclitus"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter020]IN THE DARK SHADOWS [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter020]The Cold War became a battlefield marked by doublespeak. Disguise, distortion,and deception were accepted as reality. Truth was promised in a serum. AndOperation Paperclip, born of the ashes of World War II, was the incitingincident in this hall of mirrors.But in 1952, the heedless momentum of Operation Paperclip began to slow asconflicts emerged between the JIOA and the CIA over policies with the new WestGerman government. German officials warned High Commissioner John J. McCloy thatOperation Paperclip violated NATO regulations [endnotes.xhtml#en1056] and evenAmerica’s own policies for governance in Germany. On February 21, 1952, McCloysent a memo to the U.S. Secretary of State expressing his concern that ifPaperclip was not curtailed, it could result in a “violent reaction” fromofficials in West Germany. With McCloy no longer expressing unbridled enthusiasmfor Operation Paperclip, the JIOA began to lose its once indomitable grip on theprogram. But the CIA was not bound to the same NATO policies as were the JointChiefs of Staff, and so the CIA continued to do [endnotes.xhtml#en1058] what ithad been doing—namely, recruiting Nazi scientists and intelligence officers toact as advisers at Camp King. The five-year partnership between the two agenciesbegan to unravel.JIOA officials became furious as they watched the CIA poach German scientistsand technicians from the Accelerated Paperclip lists. In response, and in spiteof McCloy’s requests otherwise, in the winter of 1952 the JIOA prepared to senda twenty-man team to Frankfurt [endnotes.xhtml#en1059] on a recruiting trip.Delegates included JIOA’s new deputy director, Colonel Gerold Crabbe; GeneralWalter Dornberger; and five unnamed Paperclip scientists who were alreadyworking in America. When McCloy learned of the trip [endnotes.xhtml#en1060], heasked the State Department to intervene and cancel it, fearing it would draw theire [endnotes.xhtml#en1057] of German officials, which it did. The trip happenedanyway.A compromise was reached [endnotes.xhtml#en1061] between U.S. officials andChancellor Konrad Adenauer’s office whereby the JIOA and the CIA agreed to stoprecruiting new scientists but could continue to work with the scientists whoremained on the original, President Truman–approved, thousand-person list.Official numbers vary dramatically in different declassified record groups, butthere were approximately six hundred Paperclip scientists in the United Statesat this time, meaning some four hundred German scientists were still on thetarget list [endnotes.xhtml#en1062]. JIOA renamed Paperclip[endnotes.xhtml#en1063] the Defense Scientists Immigration Program, or DEFSIP,and the CIA renamed one vein of its involvement the National Interest program,but most parties still referred to it all as Operation Paperclip.It was a dwindling empire. In 1956 the CIA ceded control of the GehlenOrganization to the West German government, which renamed it the BND(Bundesnachrichtendienst). The former Nazi general and his men were spies forChancellor Adenauer’s government now. Then, in 1957, JIOA got a new officer inLieutenant Colonel Henry Whalen, a man whose actions would have a profoundeffect on the legacy of the Paperclip program. By 1959 Whalen was promoted todeputy director of JIOA, which meant he had access to highly classifiedintelligence reports from scientists working on atomic, biological, and chemicalweapons. Whalen had an office in the “E” Ring of the Pentagon, reserved forsenior officials, and enjoyed direct access to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Duringhis year-long tenure [endnotes.xhtml#en1064] as JIOA deputy director, no one hadany idea that Whalen was working as a Soviet spy [endnotes.xhtml#en1066]. Itwasn’t until 1963 that the FBI learned that he had been passing military secretsto Colonel Sergei Edemski, a GRU intelligence agent posing as a military attachéin the Soviet embassy in Washington. By then Henry Whalen had already left theJIOA.When the Justice Department began investigating Whalen, they seized all of theJIOA records that he had been working with. The FBI learned that Whalen[endnotes.xhtml#en1065] had destroyed or given away thousands of Paperclipfiles. In 1966, a grand jury was presented [endnotes.xhtml#en1067] with evidenceagainst Whalen behind closed doors. He was indicted and the trial was conductedunder a gag order, with the press denied access to what the FBI had learned andto Whalen’s confession. Journalists were prohibited from reporting on the trial,and no one made the connection between Whalen, the JIOA, and OperationPaperclip. The Nazi scientist program had long since faded from publicdiscourse. Whalen was sentenced to fifteen years at a federal penitentiary butwas paroled after six years. Most of the FBI’s investigation of Whalen remainsclassified, which likely explains why so few Paperclip files from that timeframe are housed at the National Archives.In 1962, the JIOA was officially disbanded. What remained of the Paperclipprogram was taken over by the Research and Engineering Department at thePentagon. Under the DoD Reorganization Act of 1958, this new office had beencreated to handle the military’s scientific and engineering needs under ascientific director who reported to the Secretary of Defense. The act also gavea home to the Pentagon’s new in-house, cutting-edge science agency—the AdvancedResearch Projects Agency, or ARPA, later renamed DARPA—with a D for defense. Thefirst director of the Research and Engineering Department was the nuclearphysicist Herbert York. York also served as the first scientific director ofARPA. He was one of the nation’s leading experts on nuclear weapons and onIntercontinental Ballistic Missiles, or ICBMs.The ICBM is the “truly revolutionary military offspring [endnotes.xhtml#en1068]”of Hitler’s V-2 rocket, says Michael J. Neufeld, curator of the Department ofSpace History at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum and author ofseveral books and monographs on German rocket scientists. The ICBM is capable ofcarrying, in its nose cone, a weapon of mass destruction and delivering it to atarget almost anywhere in the world. The ICBM became the centerpiece of the ColdWar—the ultimate sword. It also became the ultimate shield. “Total war” with theSoviets never happened. The Cold War never became a shooting war. Deterrenceprevailed.Today, the Research and Engineering Department at the Pentagon, renamed theDepartment of Defense Research and Engineering Enterprise, develops allnext-generation weapons and counterweapons of mass destruction—the twenty-firstcentury’s swords and shields. It is as true today as it was when World War IIended that America relies upon the advancement of science and technology[endnotes.xhtml#en1069]—and industry—to prepare for the next war. Thisrelationship is understood as America’s military-industrial complex. It wasPresident Eisenhower who, in his Farewell Address to the nation in 1961, coinedthis phrase. Eisenhower cautioned Americans to be wary of “the acquisition ofunwarranted influence [endnotes.xhtml#en1070], whether sought or unsought, bythe military-industrial complex.” Eisenhower’s famous warning is well known andoften paraphrased. But he also delivered a second warning in his farewellspeech, not nearly as well known. Eisenhower told the American people that,indeed, science and research played a crucial role in national security, “[y]et,in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we mustalso be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itselfbecome the captive of a scientific-technological elite.”Herbert York, as both ARPA chief and director of the Research and EngineeringDepartment at the Pentagon, worked closely with President Eisenhower on mattersof military science during the last three years of Eisenhower’s presidency. Hewas deeply troubled by Eisenhower’s words in his Farewell Address. “Scientistsand technologists had acquired [endnotes.xhtml#en1071] the reputation of beingmagicians who had access to a special source of information and wisdom out ofreach of the rest of mankind,” said York. In the mid-1960s, York went to visitEisenhower at the former president’s winter home, in the California desert. “Iasked him to explain more fully what he meant by the warnings, but he declinedto do so,” York said. “I pressed this line of questions further by asking himwhether he had any particular people in mind when he warned us about ‘the dangerthat public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technologicalelite.’ ” York was surprised when Eisenhower “answered without hesitation:‘(Wernher) von Braun and (Edward) Teller [father of the hydrogen bomb].’ ”York spent decades considering what the President had told him. “Eisenhower’swarnings [endnotes.xhtml#en1072][,] which were based largely on his intuition,pointed up very real and extremely serious problems. If we forget or downgradehis warnings, it will be to our peril,” York wrote in his memoir, Arms and thePhysicist, in 1995.The legacy of some of the Operation Paperclip scientists as individualsparallels the heritage of many of the Cold War weapons programs theyparticipated in. The biological and chemical weapons programs can now be lookedback upon as distinct failures and the product of vague and often wrongintelligence. So it was with the Chemical Corps’ relationship with formerSS–Brigadier General Dr. Walter Schieber. Declassified files reveal thatSchieber was double-crossing the Americans from the moment he began working forthe U.S. Army in Germany, including the entire time he worked for BrigadierGeneral Charles Loucks on the sarin gas project at Loucks’s private home inHeidelberg. It took military intelligence until 1950 to determine that somethingabout Hitler’s trusted servant was untoward, and even longer to fully realizethe extent to which Speer’s Armaments Supply Office chief was deceiving them.Almost immediately after Schieber was released from Nuremberg, he began usinghis old Nazi contacts to sell heavy weapons to at least one enemy nation througha Swiss intermediary. In 1950, military intelligence [endnotes.xhtml#en1073]intercepted a four-page letter addressed to Schieber, sent from Switzerland.There was no return address on the envelope and only an illegible signatureinside. The letter writer discussed with Schieber the sale of weapons to a thirdparty, describing the buyer as “A Prince of the Royal House,” which militaryintelligence surmised was a code name. “They are looking for everything, tanks,aircraft, etc., weapons, ammunitions in short everything that pertains toarmament. I can’t write all that in a telegraph,” stated the author, whorequested “PAK anti-tank guns… willing to pay $5,000 a piece; 75 mm weapons at$3,000-$4,000 a piece, and 50mm (about $2,000.00).” This was a “first classbusiness deal [endnotes.xhtml#en1074] if we could arrange it,” the intermediarypromised.Special Agent Carlton F. Maxwell, commander of a CIC Team in Heidelberg, wasassigned the task of analyzing the letter and the situation. Maxwell quicklydetermined that the letter was legitimate and its implications dangerous. “Dr.Schieber, described as an extremely valuable scientist in the employ of theChemical Division, EUCOM, where he possibly has access to Chemical Corpsinformation of a highly classified nature, appears to be one person whom theUnited States can ill afford to have involved in any sort of internationalscheme of the nature which the letter seems to imply,” Maxwell wrote. “Subject’sconnections during the Nazi regime with the armament industry, in his capacityas Armaments Supply Chief under Dr. Albert Speer, would make him valuable as aconsultant and intermediary in any sort of plan involving illegal sales andshipments of arms.” It is remarkable that despite many warning signs, the U.S.Army placed so much trust in Schieber in the first place, and that GeneralLoucks was allowed to make back-door deals with him.Special Agent Maxwell worried [endnotes.xhtml#en1075] that “in light of recentindication of revival of right-wing activity it is not impossible to image thatthese arms might be used in a possible German monarchist coup.” Schieber neededto be watched closely, Maxwell advised. The Counter Intelligence Corps put atail on him and followed him into the Soviet zone. In four months’ time, CICconfirmed, “Schieber has contacts with a Swiss Import-Export Agency in a dubioustransaction involving the sale and shipment of arms to a foreign power.” Butthere was even worse news [endnotes.xhtml#en1076] for U.S. national security.The CIC also learned that Schieber was working for Soviet intelligence. “Subjectis in some way involved with the MGB [Ministerstvo Gosudarstvennoi Bezopasnosti,or the Ministry of State Security, a forerunner of Komitet GosudarstvennoiBezopasnosti, or the KGB] in Weimar,” Maxwell learned.Maxwell advised his superiors that it appeared Schieber was a Soviet mole andsummarized the dangers involved. Schieber had been cleared to work with highlyclassified material for the U.S. Chemical Corps, including but not limited totabun and sarin nerve gas. He had worked on classified design projects involvingunderground bunker systems for the U.S. Air Force, ones that would supposedlyprotect the U.S. government’s greatest military assets in the event of a nuclearattack. And now he was meeting with Soviet agents who were connected to theintelligence service. Maxwell was told to notify the CIA. The response from theAgency was surprising. “Just forget it,” the CIA told Maxwell, and he wasinstructed to share this message with his colleagues inside the CounterIntelligence Corps. According to declassified memos in Schieber’s file, inaddition to working for the Chemical Corps, Schieber was also working for theCIA. The Agency told Special Agent Maxwell that they had Schieber under theircontrol. Whether that meant that Schieber was spying on the Soviets as part ofan Agency plan or that he was double-crossing both nations remains a mystery.Either way, he was also working on an illegal arms deal. According to adeclassified memo in Schieber’s foreign scientist case file, he remained on theOperation Paperclip payroll until 1956 [endnotes.xhtml#en1077].In America, Dr. Walter Schieber left an indelible mark on the future of the U.S.Chemical Corps. After he and his team of Farben chemists provided General Louckswith the secret of sarin gas, the United States began stockpiling the deadlynerve agent for use in the event of total war. The program was fast-tracked atthe start of the Korean War. On October 31, 1950, Secretary of Defense George C.Marshall authorized $50 million (roughly $500 million in 2013) for the design,engineering, and construction of two separate sarin production facilities, onein Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and another inside the Rocky Mountain Arsenal[endnotes.xhtml#en1080]. Most information on biological and chemical weapons wasclassified, and no one outside a core group of senior congressmen who portionedout money for these programs had a need to know about them. “Only five membersof the House Appropriations Committee, and no more than 5 percent of the entireHouse of Representatives, were cleared for information on chemical andbiological weapons,” writes chemical weapons expert Jonathan Tucker. “As aresult, a small clique of senior congressmen [endnotes.xhtml#en1078] was able toallocate money for these programs in secret session and then bury the line itemsin massive appropriations bills that were brought to the floor for a vote withlittle advance notice, so that few members had time to read them.”Sarin production took off [endnotes.xhtml#en1079] at a frenzied pace.Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, the two plantscranked out thousands of tons of sarin nerve agent each year. The facility atRocky Mountain Arsenal, code-named Building 1501, was a windowless five-storyblockhouse designed to withstand a 6.0 earthquake and 100-mph winds. It was thelargest poured concrete structure in the United States, and for years, no one inAmerica without a need to know had any idea what went on inside. The ChemicalCorps also fast-tracked its chemical warfare munitions program, developingstate-of-the-art weapons with which to deliver deadly nerve agents in battle. Atthe Rocky Flats munitions loading plant [endnotes.xhtml#en1081], sarin wasfitted into artillery shells, aerial bombs, rockets, and warheads for missiles,with the preferred method of delivery being the M34 cluster bomb, a 1,000-poundmetal cylinder with 75 sarin-filled mini-bombs sealed inside.Shortly after the Korean War ended with an armistice on July 27, 1953, theChemical Corps began releasing public service announcements to educate Americansabout chemical warfare. In November 1953, when Collier’s magazine published[endnotes.xhtml#en1082] “G-Gas: A New Weapon of Chilling Terror. We Have It—SoDoes Russia,” the public learned for the first time that World War III with theSoviets would most likely involve nerve agents. Journalist Cornelius Ryanpresented the information about sarin in the starkest of terms. “Right now, youand your family—all of us—are unprotected against the threat of a terror weaponwhich could prove more deadly than an atomic bomb.” The army described sarin as“an odorless, colorless, tasteless nerve gas designed to destroy people withparalyzing suddenness” and warned Americans of a possible “Pearl Harbor–typeattack.” Ryan described for readers a scenario wherein a Russian strategicbomber, the Tu-4, carrying seven tons of sarin bombs, would drop its load on anAmerican city, killing every unprotected human in a 100-square-mile radiuswithin four minutes of the attack. The chief of the Chemical Corps, MajorGeneral E. F. Bullene, promised the nation that the only defense was offense.“At this time the only safe course is to be prepared to defend ourselves andready to use gas in overpowering quantities.” Brinkmanship—the practice ofpushing dangerous events to the edge, or brink, of disaster—was the new Cold Warmentality.In 1957, after years of producing sarin and filling munitions around the clock,the Chemical Corps finally fulfilled the Defense Department’s stockpilerequirement. Later that same year, Edgewood chemists found an even more lethalkiller, “a toxic insecticide that penetrated the skin like snake venom,”explains Jonathan Tucker. This nerve agent was code-named VX (the V stood forvenomous)—a battlefield killer that was three times more toxic than sarin wheninhaled and one thousand times more lethal when it came in contact with theskin. Ten milligrams of VX could kill a man in fifteen minutes. VX would be muchmore effective on the battlefield than sarin ever would be; sarin dissipatedwithin fifteen or so minutes, but when VX was sprayed, it stayed on the groundfor up to twenty-one days. Now, in 1957, the Chemical Corps began producing VXby the thousands of tons [endnotes.xhtml#en1083]. Operation Paperclip scientistFritz Hoffmann moved over from synthesizing tabun at Edgewood to working on VXmunitions [endnotes.xhtml#en1084]. But Fritz Hoffmann’s more haunting legacylies in the work he performed for the CIA’s Special Operations Division and theChemical Corps’ antiplant division. Antiplant agents include chemical orbiological pathogens, as well as insects, that are then used as part of aprogram to harm crops, foliage, or other plant life.After the death of Frank Olson, the SO Division continued its LSD mind controlschemes. But Sidney Gottlieb, the man who had suggested poisoning Frank Olson atthe CIA safe house in Deep Creek Lake, Maryland, was assigned to also work onthe CIA’s assassination-by-poison program. Fritz Hoffmann was one of thechemists at the locus of this program. “He was our searcher[endnotes.xhtml#en1085],” Edgewood laboratory director Dr. Seymour Silver toldjournalist Linda Hunt. “He was the guy who brought to our attention anydiscoveries that happened around the world and then said, ‘Here’s a newchemical, you better test it.’ ”Hoffmann’s daughter, Gabriella, remembers her unusually tall, soft-spoken fatherregularly traveling the globe in the late 1950s and early 1960s, always with amilitary escort, gathering obscure poisons from exotic toads, fish, and plants.“He would send me postcards from places like Japan, Australia and Hawaii,” sherecalls. “He always flew military [endnotes.xhtml#en1086] and he was alwaysescorted by military staff. They would pick him up at our house and bring himback home on a Sunday night.” A teenager at the time, Gabriella Hoffmannremembers the unconventional items her father brought home. “He’d unpack hisluggage before he would go back to Edgewood on Monday and in his suitcase he’dhave all these little jars. They were filled with sea urchins and things. It allseemed very exotic to me.”The poisons Fritz Hoffmann sought for the CIA included substances like curare, aSouth American blowpipe poison that paralyzes and kills people. Curare was thepoison that the CIA’s U-2 pilots carried in their flight suit pockets, hiddeninside a tiny sheath inserted into an American coin. The SO Division had aDevice Branch [endnotes.xhtml#en1088], which was run by Herb Tanner, co-designerof the Eight Ball. The Device Branch was responsible for the hardware behind thedelivery systems, including fountain pens filled with poison projectiles,briefcases that spread bacterial aerosols, poisoned candies, invisible powders,and the “non discernible microbioinoculator [endnotes.xhtml#en1087],” ahigh-tech dart gun that injected a tiny, poison-tipped dart into the bloodstreamwithout leaving a mark on the body.In other situations it behooved the CIA to locate and weaponize a poison wheredeath came after a delay, sometimes with an incubation period of about eight ortwelve hours, sometimes much longer. The SO Division’s Agent Branch worked tofind poisons that could make a target mildly ill for a short or long period oftime followed by death, very ill for a short or long time followed by death, orany number of combinations, including mild to extreme illness followed by death.The rationale behind assassinating someone with a built-in time delay was toallow the assassin to get away and to deflect suspicion. SO Division targetsincluded Fidel Castro, whose favorite drink, a milkshake[endnotes.xhtml#en1089], the CIA tried to poison several times.Another CIA target was Patrice Lumumba, the first legally elected prime ministerof Congo, who the CIA believed was a Soviet puppet. Sidney Gottlieb, the man whopoisoned Frank Olson, was assigned the job of assassin. Gottlieb later toldcongressional investigators that for this job, he needed to locate a poison thatwas “indigenous to that area [Congo] and that could be fatal.” Gottlieb decidedon botulinum toxin. Armed with this toxin concealed inside a glass jar within adiplomatic pouch, Sidney Gottlieb traveled to Congo with the intention ofkilling Prime Minister Lumumba himself. On September 26, 1960, Gottlieb arrivedin the capital, Léopoldville, and headed to the U.S. embassy. There, AmbassadorLawrence Devlin was expecting him.Two days prior, Ambassador Devlin had received a Top Secret cable from CIAdirector Allen Dulles. “We wish give every [endnotes.xhtml#en1090] possiblesupport in eliminating Lumumba from any possiblity [sic] resuming govermentalposition,” Dulles wrote. Ambassador Devlin knew to be on the lookout for avisitor who would introduce himself as “Joe from Paris.” This was SidneyGottlieb. Gottlieb’s plan [endnotes.xhtml#en1091] was to inject the botulinumtoxin into Lumumba’s toothpaste tube with a hypodermic syringe. Ideally, Lumumbawould brush his teeth and eight hours later he’d be dead. But while inLéopoldville, Gottlieb could get nowhere near Prime Minister Lumumba, who wasliving in a house on a cliff high above the Congo River. Lumumba was constantlysurrounded by bodyguards. After several days, the botulinum toxin lost itspotency [endnotes.xhtml#en1092]. Gottlieb mixed it with chlorine, tossed it intothe Congo River, and left Africa. Patrice Lumumba died in January of thefollowing year, beaten to death—allegedly by Belgian mercenaries.“My father understood the risks [of] being a chemist at Edgewood,” GabriellaHoffmann says. “Because he never spoke of anything he did there is so much thatis unknown.” For Gabriella Hoffmann, memories of an unusual childhood includetrips to military bases. “Whenever we traveled, me and my mom and dad, it wasalways to a military installation. We went to White Sands in New Mexico. We wentto military bases in California, Arizona, North Dakota, and Dugway, Utah. Iremember dad giving a lecture at Dugway Proving Ground.” Hoffmann was a centralplayer in some of the most mysterious and controversial government programs ofthe 1950s and 1960s, but the record of most of his work was destroyed or, as of2013, remains classified. Gabriella Hoffmann is in the dark about her father’slegacy, as is most of the rest of the world.What remains are Gabriella Hoffmann’s memories of the company her father kept.Dr. L. Wilson Greene, the man who coined the term “psychochemical warfare,”lived down the street and was a colleague and family friend. During the late1950s and early 1960s, Greene continued his LSD research for the army and theCIA’s psychochemical warfare programs. LSD and other incapacitating agents weretested on thousands of U.S. soldiers [endnotes.xhtml#en1093] and sailors with aquestionable degree of informed consent. To Gabriella Hoffmann, Greene wassimply an eccentric neighbor. “I recall [going] to the Greenes’ house to see theamazing train garden, his hobby, that he built in the basement. It [had] hillsand towns and little people. Ponds and lights and trains that whistled andchugged along with wisps of smoke. My attention and interest was solely on thetrains.” Another unusual neighbor on the same street was Maurice Weeks, from theDirectorate of Medical Research at Edgewood. Weeks was chief of the VaporToxicity Branch, with expertise regarding “the inhalation toxicity[endnotes.xhtml#en1094] of combustion products,” and spent his time researchinghow biological and chemical agents became even more deadly[endnotes.xhtml#en1095] when smoke and gas were involved. This picked up whereDr. Kurt Blome’s research left off; it had been discussed by Blome in OperationPaperclip consultations in Heidelberg. “Maurice Weeks was a neighbor of ours,”recalls Gabriella Hoffmann [endnotes.xhtml#en1096]. “His son, Christopher, and Iwere the best of friends. There were all these monkeys in cages in Christopher’sbackyard. Christopher and I would amuse ourselves watching these monkeys forhours on end. Obviously it never dawned on me back then what they were for.”Gabriella only learned the true nature of her father’s job during interviews forthis book.The strange, tragic thing about Fritz Hoffmann and his legacy in OperationPaperclip is that during the war he was anti-Nazi—at least according to theaffidavit written by the wartime American diplomat Sam Woods[endnotes.xhtml#en1097]. And yet here in America, working for the Army ChemicalCorps and for the CIA, Fritz Hoffmann’s science projects took on a monstrouslife of their own. This includes what his daughter believes was a role in thedevelopment of Agent Orange, the antiplant weapon, or defoliant, used by theU.S. military during the Vietnam War.“During the Vietnam War, I remember one evening we were at the dinner table andthe war was on the news,” Gabriella Hoffmann explains. The family was watchingTV. “Dad was usually a quiet man, so when he spoke up you remembered it. Hepointed to the news—you could see the jungles of Vietnam, and he said, ‘Wouldn’tit be easier to defoliate the trees so you could see the enemies?’ That’s whathe said. I remember it very clearly [endnotes.xhtml#en1098]. Years later Ilearned one of Dad’s projects was the development of Agent Orange.”The army’s herbicidal warfare program during the Vietnam War started in August1961 and lasted until February 1971. More than 11.4 million gallons of AgentOrange were sprayed over approximately 24 percent of South Vietnam, destroying 5million acres of uplands and forests and 500,000 acres of food crops—an areaabout the size of the state of Massachusetts. An additional 8 million gallons ofother anticrop agents, code-named Agents White, Blue, Purple, Pink, and Green,were also sprayed, mostly from C-123 cargo planes. Fritz Hoffmann was one of theearliest known U.S. Army Chemical Corps scientists to research the toxic effectsof dioxin—possibly in the mid-1950s but for certain in 1959—as indicated in whathas become known as the Hoffmann Trip Report [endnotes.xhtml#en1099]. Thisdocument is used in almost every legal record pertaining to litigation by U.S.military veterans against the U.S. government and chemical manufacturers for itsusage of herbicides and defoliants in the Vietnam War.It is the long-term effects of the Agent Orange program that Gabriella Hoffmannbelieves would have ruined her father, had he known. “Agent Orange turned outnot only to defoliate trees but to cause great harm in children,” GabriellaHoffmann says. “Dad was dead by then and I remember thinking, Thank God. Itwould have killed him to learn that. He was a gentle man. He wouldn’t hurt afly.”Fritz Hoffmann’s untimely death came like something out of a Special OperationsDivision’s Agent Branch playbook. He suffered a serious illness that came onquickly, lasted for a relatively short time, and was followed by death. OnChristmas Eve 1966, Fritz Hoffmann was diagnosed with cancer. Racked with pain,he lay in bed watching his favorite television shows—“Cowboy westerns and RodSerling in The Twilight Zone,” Gabriella Hoffmann recalls. One hundred dayslater, Fritz Hoffmann was dead. He was fifty-six years old.“He did try, periodically, to go to work,” Gabriella Hoffmann remembers, “but hewas in too much pain. I do have a recollection of a lot of different men in darksuits always coming by the house to talk to him. At the time, Demerol as apainkiller had just come on the market. He had a prescription for it, from adoctor at Edgewood. During the time that [he was dying] there were a lot ofquestions asked of my mother and [me] that led me to think the FBI or the CIA,or whoever the men in the dark suits were, were worried that my father wouldstart talking about whatever it was that he did. He never did say anything. Hewas silent until the end.”Hoffmann’s antiplant work in herbicides was one element of Detrick’s three-partbiological weapons division, the other two being antiman and antianimal.Antianimal weapons were aimed at killing entire animal populations, with thegoal of starving to death the people who relied on those animals for food. Atthe locus of the U.S. antianimal program was Operation Paperclip’s Dr. ErichTraub, Dr. Kurt Blome’s deputy. Traub was recruited into the AcceleratedPaperclip program by Dr. Blome’s handler, Charles McPherson, and arrived inAmerica on April 4, 1949.Traub worked on virological research [endnotes.xhtml#en1100] at the NavalMedical Research Institute, in Bethesda, Maryland. Almost all of Traub’s workremains classified as of 2013. At the Naval Medical Research Institute, Traubbecame friendly [endnotes.xhtml#en1101] with the Luftwaffe physiologist andexplosive decompression expert Dr. Theodor Benzinger, whose early work for thenavy also remains classified. In addition to working for the navy, Traub workedat Camp Detrick on antianimal research. The agents and diseases being studied[endnotes.xhtml#en1102] by Detrick researchers at this time, meant to decimate aspecific animal population, included rinderpest, hoof-and-mouth disease (alsocalled foot-and-mouth disease), Virus III disease of swine (likely African swinefever), fowl plague, Newcastle disease, and fowl malaria. All of Traub’s CampDetrick work remains classified as of 2013.In 1948, Congress had approved a $30 million budget for antianimal weaponsresearch (roughly $300 million in 2013), but because this work was so dangerous,Congress mandated [endnotes.xhtml#en1103] that it needed to take place outsidethe continental United States, on an island and not connected to the nearestmainland by a bridge. Plans moved forward and the army chose Plum Island, a1.3-square-mile land parcel located off the coast of Connecticut in the LongIsland Sound. The obvious choice for a director [endnotes.xhtml#en1104] was theworld’s expert on antianimal research, Dr. Erich Traub. But the plan to activatePlum Island for biological weapons research languished for several years.Traub received his immigrant visa on September 7, 1951, and he worked onclassified programs for three more years. Then, under mysterious circumstances,in 1954, he resigned his position as medical supervisory bacteriologist at theNaval Medical Research Institute and asked to be repatriated to Germany. He toldthe navy he’d accepted a position [endnotes.xhtml#en1105] with the West Germangovernment, as director of the Federal Institute for Virus Research. This movealarmed the JIOA. “Dr. Traub is a recognized authority in certain fields ofvirology, particularly in hoof and mouth disease of cattle and in Newcastledisease of poultry,” read a declassified report. “It can be anticipated thatthis institution in Germany [where Traub was going] will become one of theleading research laboratories of the world in virological research.” In view ofthe “recognizable military potentialities in possible application of hisspecialty, it is recommended that future surveillance in appropriate measure bemaintained after the specialist’s return to Germany.” Traub needed to be keptunder surveillance, likely for the rest of his life.In Germany, throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, U.S. militaryintelligence spied on Dr. Traub at his new home [endnotes.xhtml#en1106] onPaul-Ehrlich-Strasse, in Tübingen. Agents stopped by the home of Traub’scolleague and friend Dr. Theodor Benzinger, in Maryland, to ask whetherBenzinger knew “of any associations retained by Dr. Traub outside the UnitedStates.” Benzinger said he did not. Whenever Traub traveled outside Germany,military intelligence kept a watchful eye on him.Dr. Traub was a man experienced in the illegal trafficking of deadly pathogens.During World War II, he was the trustworthy scientist chosen by Heinrich Himmlerto travel to Turkey to obtain samples of rinderpest to weaponize on Riems. Andafter the war, when Traub fled the Russian zone at great risk of personal harm,he managed to smuggle deadly cultures with him out of the Eastern bloc, which hethen stashed at an intermediary laboratory in West Germany until he was able tolocate an appropriate buyer. In the mid-1960s, according to Traub’s FBI file,Traub moved from Germany to Iran, with a new permanent address at the RaziInstitute [endnotes.xhtml#en1107] for Serums and Vaccines, in Hesarak, a suburbof the city of Karaj. When Traub traveled from Iran to the Shoreham Hotel inWashington, D.C., for a meeting with unknown persons, FBI agents watched him.What they learned about the mysterious Dr. Traub remains classified as of 2013.Through the lens of history, it is remarkable to think that U.S. biologicalwarfare and chemical warfare programs grew so quickly to the size they did. Butthe Pentagon was able to keep the scope and cost of these weapons programssecret from Congress in much the same way that it was able to keep the damagingdetails of Operation Paperclip secret from the public. Everything wasclassified.It took President Richard Nixon to realize that playing chicken with theRussians, using a huge arsenal of biological and chemical weapons, was puremadness. On November 25, 1969, Nixon announced the end of all U.S. offensivebiological warfare research and ordered that America’s arsenal was to bedestroyed. “I have decided that the United States of America will renounce theuse of any form of deadly biological weapons that either kill or incapacitate,”Nixon said. His reasons were simple and self-evident. The use of biologicalweapons could have “uncontrollable consequences” for the world. “Mankind alreadycarries in its hands too many of the seeds of its own destruction,” said Nixon.After twenty-six years of research and development, America’s biological weaponsprograms came to an end. For the first time during the Cold War, a presidentdecided that an entire group [endnotes.xhtml#en1108] of weapons was going to beunilaterally destroyed.The end of America’s chemical weapons program was not far behind[endnotes.xhtml#en1113]. Nixon reinstated the “retaliation-only” policy, whichmeant no new chemical weapons would be developed and produced. Over the next fewyears, Congress worked with the military to determine the best way to destroythis entire group of weapons. The original plan was to dispose of sometwenty-seven thousand tons of chemical-filled weapons in the deep sea. But uponinvestigation, it turned out that many of the sarin- and VX-filled bombs storedat the Rocky Mountain Arsenal were already leaking nerve agent. These munitionsneeded to be encased in steel-and-concrete “coffins” before they could be dumpedin the ocean [endnotes.xhtml#en1109]. The Pentagon also had thirteen thousandtons of nerve agent and mustard gas stored in secret on its military base inOkinawa, Japan, which now needed to be disposed of. In 1971, these munitionswere brought to an American-owned atoll in the South Pacific called JohnstonIsland in an operation called Red Hat. The plan was to store the sarin-andVX-filled bombs in bunkers on the atoll until scientists figured out how best todestroy them. But as it turned out, the sarin and VX bombs were not made to everbe dismantled [endnotes.xhtml#en1110]. So the army had a massive new scientificendeavor on its hands, for which it created the Johnston Atoll Chemical AgentDisposal System, the world’s first “full-scale chemical weapons disposalfacility.”It took another thirty-four years for America’s arsenal of chemical weapons tobe destroyed. “The numbers speak volumes [endnotes.xhtml#en1112],” says thearmy. “More than 412,000 obsolete chemical weapons—bombs, land mines, rocketsand projectiles—all destroyed.” The elaborate destruction process involves therobotic separation of the chemical agent [endnotes.xhtml#en1111] from themunitions, followed by incineration of the separated parts in three separatespecial types of furnaces. The army says it is “proud [of its] accomplishment,”which cost an estimated $25.8 billion as of 2006, or approximately $30 billionin 2013."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter021]LIMELIGHT [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter021]America’s Cold War biological and chemical weapons programs existed in theshadows, and the majority of the Nazi scientists who worked on them maintainedanonymity for decades. Their JIOA case files and OMGUS security reports wereclassified, as were the programs they worked on. But some of the OperationPaperclip scientists enjoyed the limelight for their work, notably in instanceswhere their work crossed over from weapons projects into space-relatedendeavors. In this manner, Walter Dornberger, Wernher von Braun, and HubertusStrughold attained varying degrees of prominence and prestige in the 1950s and1960s and onward.Within two years of his arrival in the United States, Dornberger had transformedfrom public menace to American celebrity. In 1950 he left military custody atWright-Patterson Air Force Base to work for Bell Aircraft Corporation in NiagaraFalls, New York, quickly becoming vice president and chief scientist. Hisvocation was now to serve as America’s mouthpiece for the urgent need toweaponize space. Dornberger was given a Top Secret security clearance and a jobconsulting with the military on rockets, missiles, and the future of space-basedweapons. In his desk diary, housed in the archives at the Deutsches Museum inMunich, he kept track of [endnotes.xhtml#en1114] his cross-country businesstrips with an engineer’s precision. He attended “classified meetings” at U.S.Air Force bases including Wright-Patterson, Elgin, Randolph, Maxwell, andHolloman, as well as at Strategic Air Command headquarters, in Omaha, Nebraska,and the Pentagon. He also became a consultant to the Joint Chiefs on OperationPaperclip, visiting the inner circle in the Pentagon to discuss “clearanceprocedures” and the “hiring of German Scientists.” As a Paperclip scout, in 1952Dornberger traveled with what he called “Pentagon Brass” to Germany to“interview German scientists and engineers [in] Frankfurt, Heidelberg,Wiesbaden, Stuttgart, Darmstadt, Witzenhausen.”In his desk diary Dornberger also detailed an ambitious schedule of publicappearances, carefully noting the places he traveled and the people he met with.They were the kinds of engagements usually reserved for congressmen. Throughoutthe 1950s, he jetted from one event to the next, lecturing at dinners andluncheons and sometimes weeklong events. His speeches were always aboutconquest, with titles like “Rockets—Guided Missiles: Key to the Conquest ofSpace,” “Intercontinental Weapons Systems,” and “A Realistic Approach to theConquest of Space.” He orated to anyone who would listen: the Men’s Club of St.Mark’s Episcopal Church, the Boy Scouts of America, the Society of AutomotiveEngineers. When the Rochester Junior Chamber of Commerce hosted GeneralDornberger for a women’s luncheon in the spring of 1953, the local press coveredthe event with the headline, “Buzz Bomb Mastermind to Address Jaycees Today.”Dornberger became so popular that his memoir about the V-2, originally publishedin West Germany in 1952, was published in America in 1954. In these pages,Dornberger was able to reengineer his professional history from that ofwarmongering Nazi general to beneficent science pioneer [endnotes.xhtml#en1115].According to Dornberger, the research and development that had gone into the V-2at Peenemünde was a romantic, science-laboratory-by-the-sea affair. There was nomention made of the slave labor facility at Nordhausen or the slaves atPeenemünde. The book was originally titled V-2: The Shot into Space (V-2: DerSchuss ins All). “It would be nice to know [endnotes.xhtml#en1116] who inventedthe subtitle,” says Michael J. Neufeld, “which so neatly captures thereinvention of a Nazi terror weapon as the space rocket it most certainly wasnot.”In 1957, Dornberger seemed to have found his true post-Nazi calling, attemptingto sell Bell Aircraft’s BoMi (bomber-missile) to the Pentagon. BoMi was arocket-powered manned spacecraft designed for nuclear combat in space.Occasionally, and behind closed doors, usually at the Pentagon, Dornberger facedchallenges. He was once pitching the benefits of BoMi to an audience of airforce officials when “abusive and insulting remarks” were shouted at him,according to air force historian Roy F. Houchin II. In that instance, Dornbergeris said to have turned on his audience and insisted that BoMi would receive alot more respect if Dornberger had had a chance to fly it against the UnitedStates during a war. There was “deafening silence,” [endnotes.xhtml#en1117] inthe room, Houchin noted.In 1958 the FBI opened an investigation into General Dornberger based on aninsider’s tip that he might be engaged in secret discussions with Communistspies. The special agent who interviewed Dornberger did not believe he wasspying for the Soviets but honed in on Dornberger’s duplicitous nature: “It isbelieved that subject [Dornberger] could carry on satisfactorily in the role ofa double agent [endnotes.xhtml#en1118].” Dornberger was a cunning man, and thisquality, coupled with his scientific acumen, served him. No matter what thecircumstances, Dornberger always seemed to come out on top.Wernher von Braun became the biggest celebrity of the Operation Paperclipscientists. By 1950, the army decided that it required a much larger facility toresearch and develop longer-range rockets, so the Fort Bliss rocket team moved[endnotes.xhtml#en1119] from Texas to the Redstone Arsenal, near Huntsville,Alabama. There, the German scientists began work on the army’s Jupiter ballisticmissile. The group had launched sixty-four V-2s from White Sands. At the sametime, von Braun was ambitiously developing a persona for himself as America’sprophet of space travel. Rockets, outer space, and interplanetary travel hadgained a foothold in American culture. It was the dream of many 1950s Americanchildren to fly into outer space, and von Braun and Dornberger became nationalspokesmen on this issue. They promised the nation that the army’s development ofa ballistic missile was the necessary first step [endnotes.xhtml#en1120] inreaching outer space.In 1952, von Braun experienced a breakthrough in his role of national spaceadvocate when Collier’s magazine paid him $4,000 (approximately $36,000 in 2013)to write the lead article in what would eventually become an eight-part serieson future space travel, edited by Cornelius Ryan. “Within the next 10 or 15years,” von Braun wrote, “the earth will have a new companion in the skies, aman-made satellite that could be either the greatest force for peace everdevised, or one of the most terrible weapons of war—depending on who makes andcontrols it.” This space satellite, or station, would also be a “terriblyeffective atomic bomb carrier,” von Braun added. From its earliest days, spacetravel would be intertwined with war making. It still is.In addition to earning von Braun a small fortune, the Collier’s magazine seriespropelled him into the national spotlight, increasing his fame and affording himadditional writing opportunities. Most important, this newfound limelightprovided von Braun with a platform to recast himself as a patriotic American. Inthe summer of 1952, American Magazine published a piece with von Braun’s bylineentitled “Why I Chose America,” in which he professed a deep love for America,Christianity, and democracy. In the article, von Braun claimed that during thewar he opposed Nazism and was never in a position to do anything but followorders. The piece earned him an award for “patriotic writing[endnotes.xhtml#en1121],” even though it had been written by a ghostwriter. Thearticle was reprinted in at least one book and, explains Michael J. Neufeld,would thereafter be “taken as a fundamental source [endnotes.xhtml#en1122] bymany later journalists and authors.”The national attention caught the eye of Walt Disney Studios, in Burbank,California, and an executive called von Braun to see if he wanted to film acouple of space-related shows for a new television series that Disney wasworking on. For over a year, von Braun had been trying to find a New Yorkpublisher for the science fiction novel he had written while living in the Texasdesert. By this time, the novel had been rejected by eighteen publishers. TheDisney contract offered a wider road to fame and von Braun signed on. The firstDisneyland TV broadcast [endnotes.xhtml#en1123] in which von Braun appeared, in1955, called Man in Space, had an estimated 42 million viewers and was reportedto be the second-highest-rated television show in American history at the time.The following month, on April 15, 1955, von Braun and many of his fellow Germanrocket scientists became U.S. citizens, in a public ceremony held in theHuntsville High School auditorium. In 1958, von Braun and his team launchedAmerica’s first successful space satellite, Explorer I, as a quick response tothe Soviets’ Sputnik. Kurt Debus was in charge of the launch.In 1960, von Braun and a group of approximately 120 Operation Paperclipscientists, engineers, and technicians were transferred from the army to thenewly established National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or NASA, with amandate to build the Saturn rockets designed to take man to the moon. Von Braunwas made director of the new NASA facility, the Marshall Space Flight Center,also located at the Redstone Arsenal, as well as chief architect of the Saturn Vlaunch vehicle, or “superbooster” rocket, as it would become known. Von Braun’sdeputy developer on the Saturn program was Arthur Rudolph, the former operationsdirector at the Mittelwerk slave labor facility.The Saturn V rocket would need its own launch complex and hangar. CapeCanaveral, on Florida’s east coast, was chosen as the perfect site. On July 1,1962, NASA activated its Launch Operations Center there, naming Kurt Debus asdirector. Debus was the ardent Nazi who, during the war and on his own volition,had turned an engineering colleague over to the Gestapo for making anti-Hitlerremarks. To house the giant Saturn rocket, NASA constructed the VerticalAssembly Building [endnotes.xhtml#en1124] on nearby Merritt Island. Thestructure would soon become the most voluminous building in the world—largerthan the Pentagon and almost as tall as the Washington Monument. It was designedby Bernhard Tessmann [endnotes.xhtml#en1125], former facilities designer atPeenemünde and Nordhausen, and one of the two men who, at war’s end, stashed theV-2 documents in the Dörnten mine.As had Dornberger, von Braun worked carefully to whitewash his Nazi past. Heknew never to speak of the fact that he had become a Nazi Party member in 1937.When a reporter once asked him, incorrectly, about his joining the party “in1942,” von Braun put his scientist’s precision aside and chose not to correctthe newsman [endnotes.xhtml#en1126]. Instead von Braun did what he always did—hesaid that he’d been coerced into joining the Nazi Party. Never did von Braunspeak of the SS cavalry unit he joined, in 1933, or that he was made an SSofficer in 1944 and wore the SS officer’s uniform, with its swastika on thearmband and its cap with the death’s-head image. With a revelation like that, hecould have been deported under the Internal Security Act of 1950, which wasmeant to keep Communists out of the country but also covered anyone who had heldmembership in a “totalitarian dictatorship.” Instead, the fact that he was anofficer with the SS remained a jealously guarded secret by all parties—vonBraun, the U.S. military, and NASA until CNN journalist Linda Hunt broke thestory in 1985.But the dark shadow of von Braun’s complicity in Nazi war crimes followed himaround. Sometimes it snuck up on him from behind. One day, while visiting theCollier’s offices, he was riding in the elevator with fellow Paperclip ScientistHeinz Haber, from the School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Air Force Base,and Cornelius Ryan, his editor. Also in the elevator were a few Collier’smagazine staffers, one of whom reached out to Haber, rubbed a piece of thescientist’s leather coat between his fingers, and said wryly, “Human skin, ofcourse? [endnotes.xhtml#en1127]”As man got closer and closer to the moon, Wernher von Braun enjoyed a parallelascent in fortune and in fame. Because von Braun was a public figure, his Nazipast was always there, but in shadow. By the 1960s, it was sometimes treated asa joke. One night, before an Apollo mission, von Braun stormed out of a pressconference after a reporter asked him if he could guarantee that the rocketwould not hit London [endnotes.xhtml#en1128]. Tom Lehrer wrote a song famouslysatirizing von Braun: “ ‘Once the rockets are up, who cares where they comedown? That’s not my department,’ says Wernher von Braun.” Filmmaker StanleyKubrick created a von Braun–inspired character in his black comedy Dr.Strangelove, in which a mad scientist famously gets out of a wheelchair andcries, “Mein Führer, I can walk!” But in 1963, in East Berlin, a popular authorand lawyer named Julius Mader wrote a book called The Secret of Huntsville: TheTrue Career of Rocket Baron Wernher von Braun. [endnotes.xhtml#en1129] On thedust jacket there was a drawing of von Braun wearing a blackSS-Sturmbannführer’s uniform. Around von Braun’s neck was the Knight’s Cross,bestowed upon him by Albert Speer at the Castle Varlar event. The book,published by Deutscher Militärverlag, portrayed von Braun as an ardent Nazi andincluded detailed pages about the murderous conditions at the slave laborfacility at Nordhausen, where von Braun oversaw work, and at the Dora-Nordhausenconcentration camp, which supplied the slave laborers.Several German-speaking U.S. citizens alerted NASA about the allegations againstvon Braun, as if NASA did not know. The space agency’s three top officials[endnotes.xhtml#en1130], James E. Webb, Hugh Dryden, and Robert Seamans,discussed the situation with von Braun and counseled him on how to handle it. Ifanyone were to ask him about this matter, NASA administrator James Webb told vonBraun pointedly, his answer was to be, “Everything related to my past activityin Germany… is well known to the U.S. Government.” In the end, nothing much cameof the book in the Western world. The narrative mixed “damaging facts” with“completely fabricated scenes,” explains von Braun’s biographer Michael J.Neufeld, which made the book easy to discount. When NASA learned that the book’sauthor, Julius Mader, worked as an intelligence agent for the East German secretpolice, the revelations lost their potential power. If need be, Mader’s bookcould be discounted as Soviet-engineered lies, meant only to damage the prestigeof the U.S. space program.The Secret of Huntsville: The True Career of Rocket Baron Wernher von Braun wasa success in the Eastern bloc [endnotes.xhtml#en1131]. It was also translatedinto Russian and sold half a million copies in the Soviet Union. The bookinspired a Soviet-sponsored film, Die Gefrorenen Blitze (Frozen Lightning), alsowritten by Mader and released by the East German state film studio, DEFA(Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft), in 1967. The same year, West Germanprosecutors opened a new Dora-Nordhausen trial, this one called the Essen-Doratrial [endnotes.xhtml#en1133]. An SS guard, a Gestapo official, and the chief ofsecurity for the V-2 were all charged with war crimes that took place whileV-weapons were being built in the Mittelwerk tunnel complex. Mittelwerk generalmanager and former Paperclip scientist Georg Rickhey was called as a witness, aswas Wernher von Braun. Rickhey, who lived in Germany, took the stand. Hetestified under oath that he did not know about the Dora-Nordhausenconcentration camp; that he learned about it after the war. “I don’t know muchmore [endnotes.xhtml#en1132] because they were secret [concentration] camps,”Rickhey told the court. “It was a secret commando group in charge. Eyes only.There were bad catastrophic conditions [at Nordhausen] but I learned about thisonly after the war.” This was an absurd misrepresentation of the truth.Back in America, NASA general counsel refused to send the star of their spaceprogram to Germany; this would open Pandora’s box. Instead, they allowed vonBraun to deliver oral testimony at a West German consulate in the United States.As a venue, NASA lawyers suggested New Orleans [endnotes.xhtml#en1134],Louisiana—a place about as far away from the media glare as there was.Representing the Soviet-bloc survivors of Dora-Nordhausen was an East Germanlawyer by the name of Dr. Friedrich Kaul. Upon learning that von Braun would notbe coming to Germany, Dr. Kaul arranged to travel to New Orleans to take vonBraun’s testimony himself. Kaul was a supremely skillful lawyer, and he hadinformation on von Braun that was damaging.According to Michael J. Neufeld, the U.S. government knew that Dr. Kaul hadserved as legal adviser on Die Gefrorenen Blitze, and that Kaul’s goal ininterviewing von Braun was “to broadcast the connection [endnotes.xhtml#en1135]between the rocket engineer, the SS and the concentration camps.” NASA’s moonprogram would never survive that kind of publicity, and the State Departmentdenied Dr. Friedrich Kaul a visa.Instead, at the courthouse in Louisiana, von Braun answered questions put to himby a German judge. As the U.S. Army had done with the 1947 Nordhausen trial, thegovernment sealed von Braun’s testimony. Word leaked to the news media that vonBraun had been deposed for a war crimes trial, causing von Braun to issue abrief statement on the matter. He said he had “nothing to hide, and I am notimplicated.” When a reporter asked if there had been any concentration campprisoners used as slave laborers at Peenemünde, von Braun said no[endnotes.xhtml#en1136].The judge prosecuting the Essen-Dora trial also took the testimony of GeneralDornberger, in Mexico, where the now-retired Dornberger spent winters with hiswife. Some months later, von Braun and Dornberger corresponded[endnotes.xhtml#en1137] about the matter. “In regards to the testimony,fortunately I too have heard nothing more,” wrote von Braun. No news was goodnews for both men.After the Apollo 11 moon landing in July 1969, columnist Drew Pearson—whosefierce exposés of Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber had helped to banish theman from America—wrote in his column that von Braun had been a member of the SS.But von Braun’s glory had reached epic proportions, and Pearson’s article wentby relatively unnoticed. Von Braun was an American hero. Citizens all across thenation showered him with praise, glory, and the confetti of ticker-tape parades.After the Apollo space program ended, von Braun moved into the private sector.In his new life as a defense contractor, he traveled the world and met itsleaders, including Indira Gandhi, the Shah of Iran, and Crown Prince Juan Carlosof Spain. In 1973, he decided to take up flying, and in June of that year heapplied to get his pilot’s license with the Federal Aviation Administration.This required a physical and a body X-ray, which revealed a dark shadow on hiskidney. Von Braun had terminal cancer but would live for another four years.The year before he died, there was a motion inside the Ford White House to awardWernher von Braun the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The idea almost passeduntil one of President Ford’s senior advisers, David Gergen, famously wrote, ina note passed to colleagues, “Sorry, but I can’t support [endnotes.xhtml#en1138]the idea of giving [the] medal of freedom to [a] former Nazi whose V-2 was firedinto over [sic] 3000 British and Belgian cities. He has given valuable serviceto the US since, but frankly he has gotten as good as he has given.” Von Braunwas awarded the Medal of Science instead. He died on June 16, 1977. Histombstone, in Alexandria, Virginia, cites Psalm 19:1, invoking God, glory,heaven, and earth.It would be another eight years before the intrepid CNN reporter Linda Huntbecame the first person to crack the pretense of Wernher von Braun. It took aFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) record release to reveal Wernher von Braun’sNazi past.Dr. Hubertus Strughold, though never as famous as Wernher von Braun, played anequally vital role in the U.S. space program—in the field of medicine. InNovember 1948, fifteen months after Strughold arrived at the School of AviationMedicine at Randolph Air Force Base, he and Commandant Harry Armstrong hostedthe first ever U.S. military panel discussion on biology [endnotes.xhtml#en1139]in space. Strughold served as professional adviser to Armstrong at the SAM, andhe oversaw the work of approximately thirty-four German colleagues underOperation Paperclip contracts there. Strughold’s broader vision, which he sharedwith Armstrong, was to create a space medicine program for the U.S. Air Force.In 1948 the notion of human space flight was still considered science fiction bymost. But Strughold’s team had recently conducted a groundbreaking experimentwith von Braun’s rocket team at White Sands, the results of which they desiredto make public. On June 11, 1948, a nine-pound rhesus monkey named Albert wasstrapped into a harness [endnotes.xhtml#en1140] inside the nose cone of a V-2rocket and jettisoned into space. Albert’s pressurized space capsule, itsharness and its cage, had been designed by Dr. Strughold and his team. The V-2rocket carrying Albert traveled to an altitude of 39 miles. Albert died ofsuffocation during the six-minute flight, but for Dr. Strughold, the monkey’svoyage signified the momentous first step toward human space flight.Armstrong and Strughold’s biology in space panel was cosponsored by the airsurgeon, the National Research Council, and the medical research laboratory atWright-Patterson Air Force Base, Wright Lab. For the first time ever in America,space medicine was now being looked at as a legitimate military science. Twomonths later, in January 1949, Armstrong and Strughold decided it was time[endnotes.xhtml#en1141] to seek funding for a new department inside the SAMdedicated solely to researching space medicine. For this, Armstrong laterexplained, “we needed much larger accommodations [endnotes.xhtml#en1142], morespace and facilities and much more sophisticated research equipment.”Armstrong traveled to Washington, D.C., to sell the idea to Congress[endnotes.xhtml#en1143] and to explain that he and Dr. Strughold needed betweenfifteen and twenty years’ lead time to do the necessary research to preparehumans for space travel. Congress approved Armstrong’s idea. “There were no wildheadlines,” Armstrong later explained. The Department of Space Medicine at theSAM opened with little fanfare on February 9, 1949. “I appointed myself Director[endnotes.xhtml#en1144] of the new aerospace laboratory… not Dr. Strughold sincethere were [sic] still some lingering enmity toward the Germans,” Armstrong toldan air force historian in 1976. But just a few months after the departmentofficially opened, Armstrong was transferred to the Pentagon to serve as surgeongeneral of the U.S. Air Force. The man he was replacing was his long-timementor, Major General Malcolm Grow. Back in Texas, Dr. Strughold was promoted tothe position of scientific director of the Department of Space Medicine at SAM.Strughold continued to oversee the professional activities of the Paperclipscientists. He also played an active role in further recruiting endeavors. Inthe fall of 1949, he traveled to Germany [endnotes.xhtml#en1145] to try tofacilitate the hiring of Dr. Siegfried Ruff, Strughold’s long-time colleague andone of the doctors tried—and acquitted—at the Nuremberg doctors’ trial.Siegfried Ruff was the Luftwaffe doctor who had overseen Rascher’s medicalmurder experiments at Dachau. Information about Ruff’s recruitment was leaked tojournalist Drew Pearson [endnotes.xhtml#en1146], who allegedly threatened totell the president if Dr. Ruff came to the United States as part of OperationPaperclip. Ruff’s contract never materialized.A second defendant acquitted at the Nuremberg doctors’ trial was able to securea Paperclip contract with Dr. Strughold’s help. Konrad Schäfer, the “thirst andthirst quenching” expert who had “participated in the planning and execution ofthe saltwater experiments” at Dachau, arrived at the School of Aviation Medicinein August 1949. In Texas, Schäfer’s military research was supervised by Dr.Strughold and an air force captain named Seymour Schwartz. During Schäfer’s timeat SAM, he worked [endnotes.xhtml#en1147] in three departments: internalmedicine, radiobiology and pharmacology. One of his research projects involvedan effort to make Mississippi River water drinkable [endnotes.xhtml#en1148].Konrad Schäfer’s American supervisor found him inept. “The scientist [Schäfer]has been singularly unsuccessful in producing any finished work and hasdisplayed very little real scientific acumen,” Captain Schwartz wrote. “Theexperience of this Headquarters [endnotes.xhtml#en1149] indicates that this manis a most ineffective research worker and on the basis of his performance herehis future worth to the U.S. Armed Forces is nil.”In a letter to the director of intelligence at U.S. Air Force headquarters inWashington, D.C., in March 1951, Captain Schwartz requested that Schäfer’sPaperclip contract be terminated and that he be sent back to Germany[endnotes.xhtml#en1150]. The air force terminated Schäfer’s contract, but theGerman doctor refused to leave the United States. Thanks to expedited protocolsput in place by the JIOA, Schäfer was already in possession of a valid U.S.immigration visa by the time it was determined that he was incompetent. He movedto New York City [endnotes.xhtml#en1151] to work in the private sector.In the early 1950s, the School of Aviation Medicine and its Department of SpaceMedicine swiftly gained momentum as formidable medical research laboratories.The Journal of Aviation Medicine began publishing articles on space medicine,including ones written by Paperclip scientists and covering topics likeweightlessness, urinating in zero gravity, and the effects of cosmic radiationon humans. There was also classified military research going on at the SAM,including experiments involving human test subjects. In January 1994, PresidentClinton created the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments toinvestigate and report on the use of human beings in medical research related toCold War atomic tests. The Advisory Committee found many of these experiments tobe criminal and to be in violation of the Nuremberg Code[endnotes.xhtml#en1152], including studies conducted by German doctors with theSAM [endnotes.xhtml#en1154].Starting in 1951, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and the Department ofDefense conducted aboveground nuclear weapons tests [endnotes.xhtml#en1153] inthe Nevada desert, at a facility called the Nevada Proving Ground and laterrenamed the Nevada Test Site. The experiments were designed to determine howsoldiers and airmen would perform on the nuclear battlefield. The AEC and theDoD agreed that subjecting soldiers to blast and radiation effects ofvarious-sized atomic bombs was required to accurately prepare for a nuclear war.Colonel John E. Pickering was the director of medical research at the SAM in theearly 1950s. In this capacity, Pickering oversaw the research of two Germandoctors working on a group of AEC studies involving “flashblindness”[endnotes.xhtml#en1155]—the temporary or permanent blindness caused by lookingat a nuclear weapon during detonation. According to testimony Colonel Pickeringgave to the Advisory Committee in 1994, one set of flashblindness studies hadbeen suggested by Dr. Strughold. Pickering said Strughold was interested inlearning about permanent eye damage based on the fact that he himself had beenpartially blinded in one eye as a boy after watching a solar eclipse with afaulty viewing glass. “That’s the thing that gave us curiosity[endnotes.xhtml#en1156],” Pickering recalled of Strughold’s accident.Among the Paperclip scientists who carried out the initial flashblindnessstudies were Heinrich Rose and Konrad Büttner. Both men had been working for theU.S. government since the fall of 1945, when Dr. Strughold first recommendedthem for employment at the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center in Heidelberg.And like so many of Strughold’s close Luftwaffe colleagues, Rose and Büttner hadbeen Nazi ideologues during the war. Both men were long-term members of the NaziParty and also members of the SA [endnotes.xhtml#en1157].For the first set of flashblindness studies, Rose and Büttner’s test subjectswere large pigs. The two doctors calculated that the flash of a 20-kilotonatomic bomb could produce retinal burns as far as forty miles from ground zero[endnotes.xhtml#en1158]. As the atomic tests progressed, the Atomic EnergyCommission sought more specific data regarding humans. In the fall of 1951, foran atomic test series called Operation Buster-Jangle, soldier volunteers[endnotes.xhtml#en1160] were asked to stare at a nuclear explosion from varyingdistances. Crew flying in C-54 aircraft approximately nine miles from groundzero were told to look out the windows of the airplane when the bomb went off.Some wore protective eye goggles while others did not. “No visual handicaps”were reported, according to Pickering. In the spring of 1952, for an atomic testseries called Operation Tumbler-Snapper, a trailer was set up on the Nevadadesert floor, with porthole-like windows [endnotes.xhtml#en1159] at viewingrange. Soldier volunteers were asked to sit in front of the windows and stare atthe nuclear explosion. The distance from ground zero was also approximately ninemiles, only this time the soldiers were at blast level. One of the volunteers inthe viewing trailer was Colonel Pickering, who said that some of the human testsubjects were given protective eye goggles to wear but others were asked toobserve the fireball with the naked eye. Two soldiers had their eyeballs burnedand the trailer tests were suspended.In the spring of 1953, for an atomic test series called OperationUpshot-Knothole, soldier volunteers were asked to perform duck-and-cover drillsinside five-foot-deep trenches that had been dug into the desert floor severalmiles from ground zero. The men were specifically instructed not to look at theatomic blast. But curiosity got the better of at least one young officer, atwenty-two-year-old lieutenant identified in declassified records as “S.H.”[endnotes.xhtml#en1161] Instead of facing away from the blast, the lieutenantlooked over his left shoulder in the direction of the atomic bomb when itdetonated with a force of 43 kilotons.“He didn’t wear his goggles and he looked,” Colonel Pickering told PresidentClinton’s Advisory Committee in 1994. Because light enters the eye through thecornea and is refracted when it hits the lens, Pickering explained, images areflipped upside down. As a result, the image of an inverted nuclear fireball wasseared on the lieutenant’s retina “forever,” leaving what Pickering described as“probably one of the most beautiful images of a fireball [endnotes.xhtml#en1162]you’d ever see in your life.” Pickering said that doctors at the SAM kept aphotograph of the man’s eyeball for their collection. The Advisory Committeedetermined that the SAM continued its classified flashblindness studies until atleast 1962 but that most of the records had been lost or destroyed.Dr. Strughold’s personal research efforts remained focused on space medicine.Monkey astronaut rocket tests [endnotes.xhtml#en1163] at White Sands progressed.On June 19, 1949, a monkey named Albert II was blasted off into space. Duringthat flight, Strughold and his team monitored Albert II’s vitals as the V-2carried him past the Kármán line—the point at which outer space begins—andreached an altitude of 83 miles. Albert II died back on Earth, on impact, whenhis parachute failed to open. By 1952, Strughold had succeeded in convincing theair force to fund the construction of a sealed chamber, or capsule, to be usedfor space medicine research on humans. The cabin was designed by fellowPaperclip scientist Fritz Haber, brother of Heinz Haber, and completed in 1954.The sealed chamber was one hundred cubic square feet, with a single seat and aninstrument panel, and was meant to duplicate the conditions that an astronautwould experience during a voyage to the moon. The first human test was conductedin March 1956, when an airman named D. F. Smith spent twenty-four hours insidethe chamber, performing various tasks while being monitored by Strughold and histeam. Approximately two years later, in February 1958, pilot Donald G. Farrell,a twenty-three-year-old native of the Bronx chosen from a pool of rigorouslyscreened airmen, stepped into the chamber for seven consecutive days and nights.This time period, Strughold explained, was inspired by Jules Verne’s predictionof how long it would take for a spaceship to get to the moon. During the test,Strughold and Hans-Georg Clamann, Strughold’s former assistant during theLuftwaffe years, as well as two air force colleagues, monitored Donald Farrell’svitals and his ability to perform tasks.The space capsule simulator test with airman Donald Farrell attracted all kindsof media attention. On the seventh and final day, Texas senator Lyndon B.Johnson stopped by the School of Aviation Medicine to personally escort Farrell[endnotes.xhtml#en1164] out of the chamber and join him at a press conference.Dr. Strughold stood by Farrell’s side, as did General Otis Benson—the man whohad tried, and failed, to find Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber a teachingposition so he could remain in America. Benson singled out Strughold[endnotes.xhtml#en1165] for his excellent work “in the name of medical science.”So excited was Lyndon Johnson by the event that he flew Dr. Strughold and histeam to Washington, D.C., to attend a luncheon with seventy congressmen, thesecretary of the air force, and a half-dozen four-star generals. Strughold laterrecalled the event: “After the soup, [Lyndon] Johnson asked me[endnotes.xhtml#en1166] to give a five minute talk about the scope of spacemedicine and the meaning of the experiment.” Hubertus Strughold, like Wernhervon Braun and Walter Dornberger, was now an accepted member of the U.S. militaryscientific elite.But there was a bump in the road. In May 1958, Time magazine featured a pieceabout Strughold, showering him with praise as America’s space medicine researchpioneer. In response, the widely read Saturday Review published an editorial byJulian Bach Jr., a former war correspondent for the Army Talks series ofpamphlets for GIs, and “the first American correspondent to report in thegeneral press on medical experiments on human beings by Nazi doctors duringWorld War II [endnotes.xhtml#en1167].” Bach’s editorial was called “Himmler theScientist.” In it, the war correspondent reminded the public of the humanexperiments that the Nazi doctors had conducted on prisoners in concentrationcamps. “The German doctors carving them up were medical men of stature in manycases,” wrote Bach. “Only the fewest were quacks.” Bach correctly linkedStrughold to the freezing experiments at Dachau, stating that, at minimum, he“had knowledge of them.” This was the first time the public had heard anythingabout Dr. Strughold having knowledge of the medical murder experiments, a facthe had previously been able to keep hidden.The article prompted an investigation at the federal level. Because Strugholdhad become a U.S. citizen two years prior, in 1956, the Immigration andNaturalization Service (INS) was now compelled to investigate. But afterchecking with the air force, the INS released a statement saying that Strugholdhad been “appropriately investigated” before becoming a U.S. citizen. The INShad not been shown Strughold’s OMGUS security report or his classified dossier.If it had been, INS would have learned that military intelligence had concludedthat Strughold’s “successful career under Hitler would seem to indicate that hemust be in full accord with Nazism.”In October 1958, the twenty-ninth meeting of the Aero Medical Association[endnotes.xhtml#en1168] convened in San Antonio, Texas, for a daylong symposium,“Aviation Medicine on the Threshold of Space.” The group’s first internationalconvention had taken place at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel twenty-one years before.Dr. Strughold and Harry Armstrong had both been in attendance. Here they weretogether again: Armstrong and Strughold were co-hosts of the event. GeneralDornberger delivered a speech. Eleven of the forty-seven scientists inattendance had been brought to America from Germany as part of OperationPaperclip. They were American citizens now.A prolific writer, Strughold authored papers and journals[endnotes.xhtml#en1169], sometimes more than a dozen in a year. He hadcontributed a piece about space cabins to the Collier’s magazine series. Hecreated new, space-related nomenclature, including the words “bioastronautics,”“gravisphere,” “ecosphere,” and “astrobiology.” He studied jet lag—how the bodyresponds to flight—and wrote a book about his findings, Your Body Clock. In1964, he was interviewed by the space writer and journalist Shirley Thomas forher eight-volume series Men of Space. Now, with nearly two decades of distancebetween himself and his Nazi past, and with so many accolades to his name,Strughold began to construct a fictional past for himself, one in which he hadactually been an opponent of the Nazis.“I was against Hitler and his beliefs,” Strughold told Shirley Thomas. “Isometimes tried to hide myself because my life was in danger from the Nazis,” hesaid. This was, of course, absurd. Strughold was among the highest-rankingdoctor-professors in the Luftwaffe.“Were you ever forced to join the Nazi Party?” Thomas asked.“It was tried,” Strughold said. “They tried it” but failed. Strughold toldThomas that the same went for the staff at his Aviation Medical ResearchInstitute in Berlin. “Only the janitor [endnotes.xhtml#en1170] and the man whotook care of the animals” were members of the Nazi Party, Strughold lied.It was as if his close colleagues from the Nazi era—Doctors Siegfried Ruff,Konrad Schäfer, Hermann Becker-Freyseng, and Oskar Schröder—did not exist.People began to look harder into the past. On September 3, 1973, SimonWiesenthal [endnotes.xhtml#en1171], a freelance Nazi hunter who had played arole in the capture of Adolf Eichmann, wrote to Dr. Adalbert Rückerl, directorof the Central Office of the State Justice Administration for the Investigationof National Socialist Crimes, in Ludwigsburg, Germany.“I have information that Dr. Hubertus Strughold participated in experiments withhuman beings in Ravensbrück,” Wiesenthal wrote. “We don’t have the name in ourarchive. The information states that the experiments were in context of theGerman Air Force.”Dr. Adalbert Rückerl told Simon Wiesenthal that he would look into it. A fewmonths later, Rückerl wrote back to Wiesenthal to say that a comprehensiveinvestigation had been done and that the Central Office could not find anydirect evidence of Strughold’s personal participation in the medical crimes.Rückerl provided Wiesenthal with a copy [endnotes.xhtml#en1172] of the documentspertaining to the conference, “Medical Problems of Sea Distress and WinterDistress,” at the Hotel Deutscher Hof in Nuremberg in 1942, including the travelexpenses that Strughold had submitted and the amount he was paid to attend. TheLuftwaffe doctors in attendance had discussed the medical data of murderedpeople. But knowledge was not a crime, and there was no further action for theCentral Office of the State Justice Administration to take, Rückerl said.A few months later, toward the end of 1973, the U.S. Immigration andNaturalization Service announced that it was investigating Strughold andthirty-four other long-dormant cases of Nazi war criminal suspects living in theUnited States. That Strughold’s name was on the list, which was published in theNew York Times, came as a shock to him. Strughold rehearsed a succinct responsefor reporters, the same as von Braun had when allegations arose. “I was clearedbefore I came here, before I was hired,” Strughold said.Leaders of Jewish groups sprang into action, and Charles R. Allen Jr., theformer senior editor of The Nation, writing for Jewish Currents, presentedevidence about Strughold’s knowledge of human experiments. Allen had acquiredthe first public copy of the proceedings of the Nuremberg medical conference atthe Hotel Deutscher Hof in 1942, which included a list [endnotes.xhtml#en1173]of those in attendance. On this list were five other Nazi doctors who had workedin America under Operation Paperclip—Major General Walter Schreiber, KonradSchäfer, Hans-Georg Clamann, Konrad Büttner, and Theodor Benzinger—but neitherCharles R. Allen Jr. nor anyone else involved in the Strughold exposé appears tohave recognized any of these names. Twenty years prior, Major General WalterSchreiber had been fired from the SAM and banished to Argentina, and KonradSchäfer had been fired from the SAM and moved to New York. But when this storybroke in 1973, Hans-Georg Clamann, Konrad Büttner, and Theodor Benzinger had allbeen gainfully employed by the U.S. government for decades and were now livingthe American dream.The cloud of suspicion hung over Strughold. Ralph Blumenthal wrote a follow-uparticle in the New York Times, in November of 1974, describing the freezingexperiments in detail [endnotes.xhtml#en1174]. “Victims were forced to remainnaked outdoors or in tanks of ice water. Tests were made periodically as theywere freezing to death… the victims suffered agonizing deaths, after which theywere dissected for data.” INS director Leonard Chapman made inquiries with theU.S. Air Force and was told that there was “no derogatory information” onStrughold. The case was closed, yet again.Now more than ever Strughold felt the need to promote the fiction that he wasanti-Nazi. In an air force oral history interview that took place two days afterBlumenthal’s piece ran in the New York Times, Strughold told interviewer JamesC. Hasdorff [endnotes.xhtml#en1175] that during the war he constantly feared forhis life. He said that he had been written up on Hitler’s “so-called enemylist.” [endnotes.xhtml#en1176] Strughold insisted that at one point, shortlyafter the attempted assassination of Hitler by Count Claus von Stauffenberg, inJuly 1944, he, Strughold, had to go into hiding because he was receiving deaththreats—that he went from farmhouse to farmhouse until it was finally “safe toreturn to Berlin.” This was an absurd distortion of reality[endnotes.xhtml#en1177]. In the months after the Stauffenberg incident, in thewinter of 1945, Hubertus Strughold had been promoted to full colonel in theLuftwaffe reserves.Three years passed. The spotlight moved away. In a ceremony on January 19, 1977,a bronze plaque bearing a portrait of Dr. Hubertus Strughold was unveiled in SanAntonio, Texas, in the foyer at the Aeromedical Library at the School ofAerospace Medicine. The library, which was the largest medical library in theU.S. Air Force, was being dedicated to Dr. Hubertus Strughold, the Father ofSpace Medicine. The air force promised that Strughold’s bronze plaque “will bepermanently displayed in the foyer of the library.” But permanence is impossibleto predict. Only time tells what lasts."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter022]LEGACY [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter022]In the 1960s, what Operation Paperclip left behind in the country it recruitedfrom reveals contradictory truths about the program’s legacy. A watershed eventoccurred in 1963 when the West German courts opened the Frankfurt Auschwitztrial. This was the first large-scale public trial [endnotes.xhtml#en1178] ofHolocaust perpetrators to take place inside Germany. There had been oneAuschwitz trial previously, in Cracow, Poland, in 1947, in which a number ofcamp functionaries were tried, including Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss, whowas sentenced to death and hanged. But before the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial,which ran through 1965, Germany had not conducted any major war crimes trials ofits own. The Nuremberg trials, of course, were presided over by the Alliedforces. At the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial, 360 witnesses from 19 countries,including 211 Auschwitz survivors, would confront the accused. The judgeshearing the case were all Germans.Throughout the 1950s, Germany’s political and legal elite had opposed holdingthese kinds of trials for a variety of reasons, but mostly because it wouldlikely generate additional trials. Just as it behooved U.S. militaryintelligence to keep the details of Operation Paperclip a secret, so it went formany German jurists. Thousand of their fellow citizens had committed heinouscrimes during the war and were now living perfectly normal and sometimes veryproductive lives.But in 1963, with the trial under way, for the first time since 1945 people inGermany were openly talking about gas chambers, death camps, and the Holocaust.“The trial was triggered [endnotes.xhtml#en1179] by a letter I received,”recalled Hermann Langbein, the secretary of the International AuschwitzCommittee. “It was mailed to me by an Auschwitz survivor. A German [named]Rögner.” At Auschwitz, where both Langbein and Rögner had been prisoners, the SSguards had made Rögner a kapo—someone who supervised slave laborers. “He was akapo in an electrical detail,” explained Langbein, “a decent kapo. There weresome decent kapos there [at Auschwitz].”In Rögner’s letter to Langbein he wrote, “I know where Boger is.”Boger was a loaded name to anyone who had survived Auschwitz. Survivors knewBoger as the Tiger of Auschwitz. Wilhelm Boger was a man of indisputable evil.Witnesses watched him murder children on the train ramps with his own hands. InRögner’s letter to Langbein, he said that he’d filed murder charges[endnotes.xhtml#en1180] against Boger with the German authorities in Stuttgart.In the spring of 1958, in his capacity as the secretary of the InternationalAuschwitz Committee, Hermann Langbein followed up on Rögner’s tip and discoveredthat Boger was working as an accountant in a town outside Stuttgart. There, theTiger of Auschwitz lived with his wife and children as a family man. “Bringingthe man to justice was one long obstacle course,” said Hermann Langbein. Butfinally, after several months of delays, Boger was arrested.There were twenty-two codefendants in the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial. With theexception of Richard Baer, the last commandant of Auschwitz, all of the formerAuschwitz functionaries had been leading normal lives [endnotes.xhtml#en1181]using their own names. Commandant Baer had been living as a groundskeeper on anestate near Hamburg under the alias Karl Neumann. Auschwitz adjunct Robert Mulkawas working as a merchant in Hamburg; at the death camp, Mulka had served asRudolph Höss’s right-hand man. Josef Klehr was living in Braunschweig, workingat an auto body shop called Büssing & Sons; Klehr had been a medical orderly atAuschwitz and had killed thousands with lethal injections to the heart. OswaldKaduk was living in Berlin working in a nursing home; at Auschwitz Kaduk beatpeople to death with his boot. SS pharmacist Dr. Victor Capesius was living inGöppingen, a wealthy pharmacy and beauty shop owner; at Auschwitz, Capesius hadassisted the notorious Dr. Mengele in selecting individuals for medicalexperiments and had managed the death camp’s supply of Zyklon B. With theactions of all these men under scrutiny at the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial,Germany faced its past through the lens of its own jurists, not American judges.Many young Germans paid attention and began to wonder how so many war criminalscould have gotten away with so many war crimes for so long.More important to the Operation Paperclip legacy is that when Rögner filed hiscivil suit, he named another name: Dr. Otto Ambros. Ambros was listed as acriminal in Rögner’s complaint because he had been general manager of IGFarben’s Buna factory at Auschwitz. German prosecutors looked into the Ambroscase and saw that Ambros had already been tried and convicted of war crimes atNuremberg and that he had served two years and five and a half months inLandsberg Prison. They decided not to press charges against him a second time.In December 1963, however, Ambros was called to testify at the trial, which washeld in the Römer, Frankfurt’s town hall. This brought Ambros into the limelightonce again.By 1964, Ambros had been a free man for thirteen years. He was an extremelywealthy, successful businessman. He socialized in Berlin among captains ofindustry and the professional elite. When the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial started,he was a board member of numerous major corporations in Germany, including AEG(Allgemeine Elekrizitats Gesellschaft), Germany’s General Electric; HiberniaMining Company; and SKW (Süddeutsche Kalkstickstoff-Werke AG), a chemicalcompany. On the witness stand at the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial, Ambros gavetestimony that contradicted statements he had made during his own trial atNuremberg in 1947. He also said that the conditions at the Auschwitz Bunafactory had been “cozy,” and that the workers had enjoyed “good hospitality,”which many Auschwitz survivors found appalling in its offensiveness. Whilecontradictory statements might have gone unnoticed by Frankfurt’s judges andjurors, there were a number of high-profile Israeli journalists in the courtroomwho had become experts on the subject and caught Ambros’s lies. Thesejournalists began at once to investigate Otto Ambros’s post-Nuremberg life. Herewas a man who had been convicted of slavery and mass murder and had served verylittle time, considering the crimes. The Farben slaves at Auschwitz numberedsixty thousand, approximately thirty thousand of whom had been worked to death.The journalists covering the trial were outraged by what they discovered. OttoAmbros now sat on the board of directors of numerous private corporations, buthe was also on the board of directors of five companies that were owned by theFederal Republic of Germany. The exorbitant fees Ambros commanded in thesepositions were being paid by the German taxpayer. An Israeli female journalist,identified in Bundesarchiv documents only as “Frau Deutschkren,” became soincensed by the arrogance and hubris she saw in Otto Ambros’s postwar life thatshe wrote a letter to the state minister of finance, Ludger Westrick. That theFederal Republic of Germany was paying a “consulting fee” of 12,000deutschmarks—about $120,000 in today’s dollars—to a convicted war criminal wasshameful, Frau Deutschkren said. She demanded that Finance Minister LudgerWestrick meet with her. He agreed.Frau Deutschkren could not have known that Otto Ambros and Finance MinisterLudger Westrick were business colleagues [endnotes.xhtml#en1182] and apparentlyon very friendly terms, as state archive correspondence reveals. After themeeting, Westrick promised to look into the matter. Instead, he told Ambros whatwas going on. In an effort to hold on to his lucrative and prestigious positionson company boards, Ambros produced a summary of the allegations against himselfand his Nuremberg codefendants, written by his attorney, a Mr. Duvall. Ambrosasked Finance Minister Westrick to circulate this apologia around the variousboards on his behalf. “As a short summary of our case [shows] you will clearlyfind out we are innocent,” Ambros explained, referring to charges of slavery andgenocide that he and his Farben colleagues were convicted of at Nuremberg. “Iand my colleagues are the victims of the Third Reich [endnotes.xhtml#en1183],”Ambros insisted. “The former government utilized the success of synthetic rubberwhich they used to make a profit. If there had been anything against me, then Iwould have never been released by the American military.” U.S. High CommissionerJohn J. McCloy had granted Ambros clemency under intense political pressure, afact now being used by Ambros to suggest that he had been wrongly convicted atNuremberg.In a letter dated April 25, 1964, Ambros reminded Finance Minister Westrick thatafter he had been released from Landsberg Prison in 1951, “You helped me getback on the boards.” For this, Ambros said he was grateful. “I see it as anhonor and a duty to [remain] there. I do this for pure altruistic reasons. Iappreciate anything you can do.” In turn, Finance Minister Westrick wroteletters to the various boards on Ambros’s behalf. “Ambros was chosen for theboard because of exceptional talent,” Westrick said. “In his field he is aswanted as Wernher von Braun. Everyone wants him. He can get a job anywhere hewants, anywhere in the world.”The Israeli journalists refused to let up on Otto Ambros. They continued towrite news stories about him, making it increasingly difficult for both theFederal Republic of Germany and the publicly traded companies on whose boardsAmbros sat to maintain business associations with him. “Former War Criminal[endnotes.xhtml#en1184] Found Refuge in Switzerland,” read a headline on June 6,1964. The story detailed time that Ambros spent in the Swiss village of Pura.Ambros, furious, submitted a “statement of facts” to Labor Ministry statesecretary, Ludwig Kattenstroth, in response. “I did not hide myself in Pura,”Ambros wrote. “It is my holiday home. And I have to say that when I bought theparcel there [in 1956] I informed the Swiss government by handing over thejudgment at Nuremberg. I am only there for holidays… my children go there, andmy friends. After consulting with my lawyer, I will never go back.” Then camethe blaming. “The whole affair [endnotes.xhtml#en1185],” wrote Ambros, “has tobe seen in the shadow of the Frankfurt trial. A certain faction of the press istrying to blame me.” The subtext was that “the Jews” were trying to blame him.In late summer of 1964, AEG’s board members met and decided that they could nolonger retain convicted war criminal Otto Ambros. Ambros then also quietly leftat least two of the five taxpayer-funded consulting positions he held on FederalRepublic of Germany boards.In separate letters to Finance Minister Ludger Westrick and Deputy FinanceMinister Dr. Dollinger, a new secret was revealed, though Ambros promised not tomake public a piece of the information they shared. “Concerning the firms abroadwhere I am a permanent co-worker advisor,” Ambros wrote, “I won’t name them[publicly] because I don’t want to tip off any journalists who might causetrouble with my friends. You know about W. R. Grace [endnotes.xhtml#en1187] inNew York… and I hope I can stay with Hibernia Company. Concerning the firms inIsrael,” Ambros wrote, “stating their names publicly would be very embarrassingbecause they are [run by] very public, well-respected persons in publicpositions that have actually been at my home and are aware of my position, how Ibehaved during the Reich [endnotes.xhtml#en1186], and they accept this.”The “well-respected” public figures in Israel to whom Ambros referred have neverbeen revealed. That Ambros also had worked for the American company W. R. Gracewould take decades to come to light. When it did, in the early 1980s, the publicwould also learn that Otto Ambros worked as a consultant for the U.S. Departmentof Energy, formerly the Atomic Energy Commission, “to develop and operate aplant for the hydrogenation of coal in a scale of 4 million tons/year at theformer IG Farben industrie.” That a convicted war criminal had been hired by theDepartment of Energy sparked indignation, and congressmen and journalists soughtfurther details about Ambros’s U.S. government contract. In a statement to thepress, the Department of Energy insisted that the paperwork had been lost.The scandal was brought to the attention of President Ronald Reagan. Letters onWhite House stationery reveal that Deputy National Security Adviser James W.Nance briefed Reagan about how it was that the U.S. government could have hiredOtto Ambros. Nance’s argument to the president was that many others hired him.“Dr. Ambros had contacts [endnotes.xhtml#en1188] with numerous officials fromAllied countries,” wrote Nance. “Dr. Ambros was a consultant to companies suchas Distillers Limited of England; Pechiney, the French chemical giant; and DowEurope of Switzerland. He was also the chairman of Knoll, a pharmaceuticalsubsidiary of the well known chemical corporation BASF.” President Reaganrequested further information from the Department of Energy on its Ambroscontract. Nance told the president, “The DOE and/or ERDA [The Energy Researchand Development Administration] do not have records that would answer thequestions you asked in the detail you requested. However, with Dr. Ambros’involvement in the company shown and his special knowledge in hydrogenation ofcoal, we know there were productive contacts between Dr. Ambros and U.S. energyofficials.” Even the president [endnotes.xhtml#en1189] of the United Statescould not get complete information about an Operation Paperclip legacy.In the midst of the scandal, a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicletelephoned Ambros at his home in Mannheim, Germany, and asked Ambros about his1948 conviction at Nuremberg for mass murder and slavery.“This happened a very long time ago,” Ambros told the reporter. “It involvedJews [endnotes.xhtml#en1190]. We do not think about it anymore.”The third act of Dr. Kurt Blome’s life contradicts the idea that the Sovietswere desperately trying to hire Hitler’s former biological weapons maker. InFebruary 1962, a group of Communist physicians from Karl Marx University, inLeipzig, East Germany, sent an open letter “to all the doctors and dentists[endnotes.xhtml#en1191] living in Dortmund,” as well as many widely distributednewspapers “regarding the matter of the Dortmund physician, Dr. Kurt Blome.” Theletter listed the war crimes Blome had been accused of at the Nuremberg doctors’trial and stated that everyone in the town of Dortmund should “know who he isand what he did to the Jewish people.” The Leipzig doctors identified the doctorin Dortmund as “the Deputy Surgeon General of the Third Reich.” They wrote thatWestern German medical colleagues should distance themselves “from this man whodares to call himself a doctor.” Blome was contacted by the East German radiostation, Radio Berlin International, for comment. He agreed, and an interviewwas arranged for February 22, 1962.“I have read the two pages you have presented to me,” Blome told his intervieweron the appointed day. “During the war I got the task to prepare a serum, avaccine, against a bacterial plague. This all started because [Major General]Dr. Schreiber told a lie. Schreiber is a pawn of the Russians. It’s a swornlie.” Blome spent the rest of his radio time blaming Schreiber for his ownmisfortunes. He ended by pointing out his innocence; Blome reminded the radioannouncer that he had endured a ten-month trial at Nuremberg. “I was acquittedon every point that there was,” Blome said. “The U.S. judges were not easy. Theyhanded out seven death penalties and five lifelong imprisonments. If I had beenguilty, they would have convicted me.”The allegations opened a subsequent investigation into Blome. Two weeks later,on April 4, 1962, the state’s attorney in Dortmund wrote to the Central Officeof the State Justice Administration for the Investigation of National SocialistCrimes to see if there was anything on Dr. Kurt Blome. The state’s attorney puttogether a dossier on Blome, with most of the focus on a letter Blome hadwritten on November 18, 1942, to Reich Governor (Reichsstatthalter) Arthur KarlGreiser, mayor of a Polish area near Posen and subsequently executed for warcrimes. The subject matter was Sonderbehandlung, [endnotes.xhtml#en1192] or“special treatment,” of Poles with tuberculosis. By now, in 1962, it had beenestablished that Sonderbehandlung was a Nazi euphemism for extermination. Inthis 1942 correspondence, Blome and Greiser agreed that the best way to dealwith this group of tubercular Poles being discussed was to give them “specialtreatment.” But Blome also raises “a problem” that had to be dealt with—namely,that if these tubercular Poles were to be exterminated, “[t]he generalperception by relatives would be that something unorthodox is going on.” Blomereminds Reich Governor Greiser that the group they are proposing specialtreatment for totals approximately thirty-five thousand people.Blome was called in to an interview with the state’s attorney. “I am aware thatthere is an investigation,” Blome said. “My position is that this has alreadybeen investigated by the Americans.” Dr. Blome then made the same argument hehad used at Nuremberg as a defendant in the doctors’ trial: that he may haverecommended the extermination of thirty-five thousand Poles as a course ofaction, but that there was no proof that that action ever took place. Intent,Blome maintained, is not a crime. “Furthermore,” Blome told investigators, “Iwant to add that I put the blame on [Major General Dr. Walter] Schreiber basedon what I learned at the trial.” Blome said that Dr. Schreiber was the truemurderer and that he had framed Dr. Blome to deflect the guilt away fromhimself. After several days of consideration, on May 21, 1962, the state’sattorney placed the investigation of Dr. Blome on hold. Blome continued topractice medicine in Dortmund and the case against him was never reopened. Threeyears later, Blome was dead. “He died of emphysema,” says his son, who alsoreports that, by the time of his father’s death, Dr. Kurt Blome was alone andestranged [endnotes.xhtml#en1193] from the world.Albert Speer served all twenty years of his sentence at Spandau Prison outsideBerlin, despite the efforts by John J. McCloy, as U.S. High Commissioner forGermany, to get Speer released earlier. In 1956 McCloy wrote to Speer’s wife,Margarete, “I have a very strong conviction [endnotes.xhtml#en1194] that yourhusband should be released and would be very happy if I could do anything toexpedite such a release.”In prison Speer secretly worked on the memoirs he would publish upon hisrelease. On pieces of toilet paper, cigarette wrappers, and paper scraps hejotted down recollections of his days working alongside Hitler and the innercircle. It was illegal to write and send unscreened notes out of Spandau, soSpeer had his writing smuggled out by two sympathetic Dutch Red Cross nurses[endnotes.xhtml#en1195]. The notes were delivered to Speer’s old friend andcolleague Rudolf Wolters, a diehard Hitler loyalist living in Berlin. Over thecourse of twenty years Wolters painstakingly typed up tens of thousands of theseindividual paper scraps that Speer continued to send to him. After twenty yearsthey amounted to a thousand-page manuscript, which Wolters turned over to Speerupon Speer’s release. With the advance payments Speer received on his memoirs—hewould write two, Inside the Third Reich and Spandau: The Secret Diaries—Speerbecame a wealthy man once again. He earned a reported 680,000 deutschmarks fromDie Welt for serialization rights, and a reported $350,000[endnotes.xhtml#en1196] (roughly $2.4 million in 2013) advance forEnglish-language book rights. Albert Speer bought a sports car and embarked on anew life as a successful author.He never thanked or acknowledged Rudolf Wolters for his twenty years of work, atleast not in his book and not publicly. A decade later, Speer defended thisdecision to his biographer, Gitta Sereny, saying “[I]t was for [Wolters’s] ownprotection.” Wolters’s son reported that when Wolters died, the last word heuttered was “Speer.”After Speer sent Wernher von Braun a copy of Spandau, von Braun wrote a letterto his old friend and former boss at the Reich’s Ministry of Armaments and WarProduction, pointing out how divergent their lives had been over the past twentyyears. While Speer had been at Spandau Prison, von Braun’s star had risensteadily. He thanked Speer for the book. “How often I thought of you[endnotes.xhtml#en1197] during those last twenty long years when so much washappening in my life,” wrote von Braun.When Siegfried Knemeyer learned that Albert Speer was out of prison, Knemeyertook a trip to visit his old friend in Germany. The last time the two men hadseen each other was in Berlin in April 1945, when Knemeyer was helping Speerplot his escape to Greenland. In the years that Speer had been in prison,Knemeyer had been working for the United States—formerly the sworn enemy of bothmen. As an employee of the U.S. Air Force in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s,Knemeyer worked on classified and unclassified projects, won awards, and rose upthrough the ranks. For the air force, he established the Pilot Factors Program[endnotes.xhtml#en1198], which coordinated technologies as aircraft went fromsubsonic to supersonic flight. Upon his retirement in 1977, Pentagon officialsawarded Knemeyer their highest civilian award, the Distinguished CivilianService Award. Knemeyer died of emphysema two years later, on April 11, 1979.His last wish was that his body be “immediately taken to a crematory[endnotes.xhtml#en1199]” and that no funeral be held. “He served his nativecountry, Germany, and his adopted country, America, with equal enthusiasm anddedication,” said his son Sigurd Knemeyer.To the end, Albert Speer denied that he had direct knowledge of the Holocaust.Sixty-seven years after interviewing Speer at the Ashcan interrogation facilityin Luxembourg, John Dolibois still takes umbrage at this. “I asked [Speer] if hewas at the Wannsee Conference at which Himmler announced the ‘Final Solution’for eradicating Jews,” Dolibois explains. “In my opinion, anyone who was at thatmeeting could not say he knew nothing about extermination camps—like Auschwitz,Sobibor, Birkenau. Speer first denied being at Wannsee, then admitted [to me] hewas there, but left before lunch and missed the important announcements. Othersalso asserted [Speer] was not telling the truth. I think he should have beenhanged.”Albert Speer died in a London hotel room in 1981. He was in town doing aninterview for the BBC. “One seldom recognizes when the Devil[endnotes.xhtml#en1200] puts his hand on your shoulder,” Albert Speer told JamesP. O’Donnell in a New York Times Magazine interview shortly after his releasefrom Spandau. He was referring to Hitler but might have been talking abouthimself."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter023]WHAT LASTS? [toc.xhtml#toc-chapter023]In the 1970s, several events led to a major shift in the American public’sperception of the Holocaust, Nazis, and the United States. A series ofcongressional oversight hearings were convened as a result of many high-profilecases of Nazi war criminals found living in America. The hearings drew attentionto the fact that the Immigration and Naturalization Service had been negligentin its investigations of these individuals and in turn led to the creation ofthe Justice Department’s Office of Special Investigations. Then came the 1978broadcast of NBC’s four-part miniseries Holocaust, which broke records forfamily viewing and made Americans who had never contemplated the Holocaust thinkseriously about what had happened in Nazi Germany and what the state-sponsoredmurder of six million people really meant. These events set the stage for asimple, fortuitous occurrence for a young Harvard law student named EliRosenbaum, the consequences of which would profoundly impact the Paperclipscientists who had something to hide.In 1980, Eli Rosenbaum was perusing book titles inside a Cambridge bookstorewhen he came across Dora: The Nazi Concentration Camp Where Modern SpaceTechnology Was Born and 30,000 Prisoners Died, written by a former Doraprisoner, the French Resistance fighter Jean Michel. The narrative is detailedand revelatory in its brutal honesty. Jean Michel called his book an homage tothe thirty thousand slave laborers who died building the V-2s. He comments onthe memoirs written by Wernher von Braun and General Dornberger, and thecountless interviews given by many of the other V-2 scientists who worked underOperation Paperclip. None of these Germans, notes Michel, utters a word aboutNordhausen.“I do not reproach [endnotes.xhtml#en1201] these men with not having made publicconfessions after the war,” Michel writes. “I do not hold it against thescientists that they did not choose to be martyrs when they discovered the truthabout the [death] camps. No, mine is a more modest objective. I make my standsolely against the monstrous distortion of history which, in silencing certainfacts and glorifying others, has given birth to false, foul and suspect myths.”In that same Cambridge bookstore, on that same day, Eli Rosenbaum came across asecond book about the V-2 rocket. This one was called The Rocket Team and waswritten by Frederick I. Ordway III and Mitchell R. Sharpe, with an introductionby Wernher von Braun. The book discusses and quotes the German scientistsinvolved in the U.S. rocket program. In one part of the book, engineer ArthurRudolph—praised as the developer of NASA’s Saturn V rocket program—shares histhoughts with the authors. Rudolph is not identified as having once beenoperations director at the Mittelwerk slave labor facility.Rudolph relates [endnotes.xhtml#en1202] an anecdote from the war, concerning hisdismay at being called away from a New Year’s Eve party in 1943–44 because of aproblem with some of the V-2 rockets. An accompanying photograph shows a POW instriped prisoner pajamas moving rocket parts. Eli Rosenbaum had spent theprevious summer working for the Department of Justice in its Office of SpecialInvestigations. He knew that the Geneva Convention forbade nations from forcingprisoners of war to work on munitions. He had also just read about what went onin the Nordhausen tunnels in Jean Michel’s book Dora. Rosenbaum later recalled[endnotes.xhtml#en1203] that he “was particularly offended by Rudolph’s takingumbrage at missing a gala party while slave laborers toiled.” The followingyear, after graduating from Harvard Law School, Rosenbaum started full-time workat the Department of Justice as a trial lawyer. He persuaded his boss, Neal M.Sher, to open an investigation into Arthur Rudolph.In September of 1982, Marianne Rudolph, the daughter of Arthur Rudolph, receivedan unexpected telephone call at her home in San Jose, California. It was theDepartment of Justice calling. They explained that they had been trying to reachher father, Arthur Rudolph, who apparently lived nearby, but that they had beenunable to do so. Marianne Rudolph, who worked as an artist for NASA, told thecaller that her parents were vacationing in Germany and would be back at the endof the month.The day after the Rudolphs returned, Arthur Rudolph received a registered letterin the mail from the Department of Justice, Office of Special Investigations.The letter stated that questions had been raised regarding Arthur Rudolph’sactivities [endnotes.xhtml#en1204] during the Second World War. Rudolph wasasked to meet with DOJ officials at the San Jose Hyatt on October 13 and tobring any documents with him that he owned covering the period between 1933 and1945. During this first meeting, which included Arthur Rudolph, OSI directorAllan A. Ryan Jr., Deputy Director Neal M. Sher, and trial attorney EliRosenbaum, the interview lasted five hours. There were two central questions thelawyers wanted answered: Owing to what set of principles had Rudolph decided tojoin the Nazi Party, which he did in 1933, and what exactly did he know aboutthe Nordhausen executions, specifically about the prisoners who had been hangedfrom a crane? DOJ lawyers Allen, Sher, and Rosenbaum had documents with themincluding the previously sealed testimony from the 1947 Dora-Nordhausen trial.These documents included pretrial investigative material regarding formerPaperclip specialist Georg Rickhey. Among the documents was the interview thatRudolph gave, on June 2, 1947, to Major Eugene Smith of the U.S. Army Air Force.In that testimony, Rudolph had first said that he never saw any prisoners beatenor hanged. Later in the interview with Major Smith, Rudolph changed his story tosay that he had been forced to watch the hangings but had nothing to do withthem.During the San Jose Hyatt interview in 1982, the three Justice Departmentlawyers presented Rudolph with the drawing made by his former Nordhausencolleagues from Fort Bliss, the rocket engineers Günther Haukohl, RudolphSchlidt, Hans Palaoro, and Erich Ball. This drawing illustrated the layoutinside the tunnels and had been used as evidence in the Dora-Nordhausen trial.The Justice Department lawyers pointed out to Rudolph that there was a cleardotted line, labeled “Path of Overhead Crane Trolly [sic] On Which Men WereHung.” The dotted line ran right by Rudolph’s office, which suggested that itwould have been impossible for Rudolph not to have seen the hangings. Thelawyers asked why he had lied. They also asked Rudolph about testimony from the1947 Dora-Nordhausen trial that revealed that, at the Mittelwerk tunnel complex,he received daily “prisoner strength reports which showed the number ofprisoners available for work, the number of ‘new arrivals,’ and the number ofpeople lost through sickness or death.’ ” They said that, clearly, Rudolph knewpeople were being worked to death and were being replaced by fresh bodies fromthe Dora-Nordhausen concentration camp.Back in Washington, D.C., the Justice Department put together its case. Fourmonths later, on February 4, 1983, a second meeting took place at the San JoseHyatt, and, shortly thereafter, Rudolph received a letter from the JusticeDepartment in the mail. “Certain preliminary decisions have now been made,”wrote Neal Sher. “I would be prepared to discuss these decisions, as well as theevidence amassed to date, with an attorney authorized to represent yourinterest.”The government stated intentions to pursue its case against Arthur Rudolph“showing that Mr. Rudolph enforced the slave labor system at Mittelbau[Mittelwerk] and aided in the transmission of sabotage reports to the SS.”Arthur Rudolph had two choices, the Justice Department said. He could hire alawyer and prepare to stand trial, or, alternatively, he could renounce his U.S.citizenship and leave the country at once.Thirty-eight years after coming to America as part of Operation Paperclip,Arthur Rudolph left the United States, on March 27, 1984. Neal Sher met ArthurRudolph at the San Francisco International Airport and made sure he got on theairplane.It was another seven months before the Justice Department made public thatArthur Rudolph had renounced his citizenship so as to avoid facing a war crimestrial. When asked to comment, Eli Rosenbaum said that Arthur Rudolph hadcontributed to “the death of thousands of slave laborers.” But Rosenbaum alsosaid that it was Rudolph’s “almost unbelievable callousness and disregard [for]human life” that surprised him most. The story became front-page news around theworld.Some individuals affiliated with NASA and other rocket-related governmentprograms remained staunch supporters of Arthur Rudolph, calling the JusticeDepartment’s actions against him a “witchhunt.” One of Rudolph’s leadingproponents [endnotes.xhtml#en1205], Hugh McInnish, an engineer with the U.S.Army Strategic Defense Command, helped promote the idea that Rudolph,Dornberger, and von Braun had all confronted members of the SS during the warand had tried to get better working conditions for the slave laborers. “Theirdefenders’ assertions must be regarded with the greatest skepticism, especiallyas there is not a single document [endnotes.xhtml#en1206] to back them up,” saysMichael J. Neufeld. “There is little doubt [endnotes.xhtml#en1207] in my mindthat Rudolph was deeply implicated.” The Rudolph exposé triggered keen interestin how it was that Arthur Rudolph came to America in the first place. This was aturning point in Operation Paperclip’s secret history.There is a broad misconception in America that there exists some kind ofautomatic declassification system that requires the government to reveal itssecret programs after thirty or fifty years. In reality, the most damagingprograms often remain classified for as long as they can be kept secret. TheFreedom of Information Act, signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson, allowsfor the full or partial disclosure of some documents, but a request must beinitiated by an individual or a group and is by no means a guarantee thatinformation will be obtained. After the Arthur Rudolph story broke, journalistLinda Hunt began reporting on Operation Paperclip for CNN and the Bulletin ofthe Atomic Scientists. She filed FOIA requests with the different militaryorganizations and intelligence agencies involved and received varied responses.“I obtained six thousand Edgewood Arsenal documents in 1987 but it took morethan a year, two attorneys and a threatened lawsuit to get the records[released],” says Hunt. When she arrived at the Washington National RecordsCenter in the late 1980s to inspect the documents, she was told that Edgewood’sown historian had checked out seven of the boxes and that another twelve weremissing. The army later agreed to look for the missing records and sent her abill for $239,680 [endnotes.xhtml#en1208] in so-called search fees (theequivalent of $500,000 in 2013). Eventually Linda Hunt was granted access to thedocuments, and in the early 1990s she published a book that unveiled many ofOperation Paperclip’s seemingly impenetrable secrets. It was now no longerpossible for the government to uphold the myth that Paperclip was a programpeopled solely by benign German scientists, nominal Nazis, and moral men.As if pushing back against the Office of Special Investigations, just a fewmonths after Arthur Rudolph was expelled from the United States, the TexasSenate passed a resolution declaring that June 15 was Dr. Hubertus StrugholdDay. Then Ohio State University’s medical college unveiled a portrait ofStrughold on its mural of medical heroes. But the attempts by one organizationto perpetrate a false myth can serve as a great motivator for anotherorganization, and to this end the World Jewish Congress discovered and releasedinformation on Dr. Strughold that army intelligence had managed to keepclassified for nearly fifty years. The New York Times verified that Dr.Strughold had been listed [endnotes.xhtml#en1209] as among those being sought onthe 1945 Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects, or CROWCASS,list. Strughold’s portrait was removed from the Ohio State mural, where heappeared, ironically, alongside Hippocrates.Citizens who were offended by the Strughold library at the Brooks Air Force Baseasked the air force when Strughold’s name was going to be removed from the U.S.government building. Library spokesman Larry Farlow told the Associated Pressthat there were no plans to remove the name from the Strughold AeromedicalLibrary. But growing pressure from the public forced the air force to reconsiderits position. In 1995 General Ronald R. Fogleman, chief of staff of theDepartment of the Air Force, issued a terse statement stating that afterreviewing Nazi-era documents, “the evidence of Dr. Strughold’s wartimeactivities is sufficient to cause concern about retaining his name in an honoredplace on the library.” The sign was removed from the building’s exterior brickwalls, and the Strughold bronze portrait was taken down. The permanence of thehonor had come to an end. Strughold died the following year, at the age ofeighty-eight. The Justice Department had been preparing a Nazi war criminal caseagainst Strughold in his final years.What does last? The desire to seek the truth? Or, in the words of Jean Michel,the ability to take a stand against “the monstrous distortion of history” whenit gives birth to “false, foul and suspect myths”? In 1998, Congress passed theNazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, which required various U.S. government agenciesto identify and release federal records relating to Nazi war criminals that hadbeen kept classified for decades. In accordance with the act, President Clintonestablished an Interagency Working Group—made up of federal agencyrepresentatives and members of the public—to oversee the interpretation of overeight million pages of U.S. government records and report its findings toCongress. The documentation revealed a vast web of profitable relationshipsbetween hundreds of Nazi war criminals and U.S. military and intelligenceagencies.In 2005, in a final report to Congress, U.S. Intelligence and the Nazis, theInteragency Working Group determined that “[t]he notion that[endnotes.xhtml#en1210] they [the U.S. military and the CIA] employed only a few‘bad apples’ will not stand up to the new documentation.” In hindsight, wrotethe Interagency Working Group, the government’s use of Nazis was a very badidea, and “there was no compelling reason [endnotes.xhtml#en1211] to begin thepostwar era with the assistance of some of those associated with the worstcrimes of the war.” And yet history now shows us that that is exactly what theAmerican government did—and continued to do throughout the Cold War.In the decades since Operation Paperclip ended, new facts continue to come tolight. In 2008, previously unreported information about Otto Ambros emerged,serving as a reminder that the story of what lies hidden behind America’s Naziscientist program is not complete.A group of medical doctors and researchers in England, working on behalf of anorganization called the Thalidomide Trust, believe they have tied the wartimework of IG Farben and Otto Ambros to the thalidomide tragedy of the late 1950sand early 1960s. After Ambros was released from Landsberg Prison, he worked asan economic consultant to German chancellor Konrad Adenauer and to theindustrial magnate Friedrich Flick, the richest person in Germany during theCold War. Like Ambros, Flick had been tried and convicted at Nuremberg, thenreleased early by John J. McCloy.In the late 1950s, Ambros was also elected chairman of the advisory committee[endnotes.xhtml#en1212] for a German company called Chemie Grünenthal.Grünenthal was about to market a new tranquilizer that promised pregnant womenrelief from morning sickness. The drug, called thalidomide, was going to be soldunder the brand name Contergan. Otto Ambros served on the board of directors ofGrünenthal. In the late 1950s, very few people knew that Grünenthal was a safehaven for many Nazis [endnotes.xhtml#en1213], including Dr. Ernst-GüntherSchenck, the inspector of nutrition for the SS, and Dr. Heinz Baumkötter, an SScaptain (Hauptsturmführer) and the chief concentration camp doctor inMauthausen, Natzweiler-Struthof, and Sachsenhausen concentration camps.Ten months before Grünenthal’s public release of thalidomide, the wife of aGrünenthal employee, who took the drug to combat morning sickness, gave birth toa baby without ears. No one linked the birth defect to the drug, and thalidomidewas released by the company. After several months on the market, in 1959,Grünenthal received its first reports that thalidomide caused polyneuropathy, ornerve damage, in the hands and feet of elderly people who took the drug. Thedrug’s over-the-counter status was changed so that it now required aprescription. Still, thalidomide was marketed aggressively in forty-sixcountries with a label that stated it could be “given with complete safety[endnotes.xhtml#en1214] to pregnant women and nursing mothers without anyadverse effect on mother and child.” Instead, the drug resulted in more than tenthousand mothers giving birth to babies with terrible deformities, creating themost horrific pharmaceutical disaster in the history of modern medicine. Many ofthe children were born without ears, arms, or legs and with reptilian,flipperlike appendages in place of healthy limbs.The origins of thalidomide were never accounted for. Grünenthal had alwaysmaintained that it lost its documents that showed where and when the first humantrials were conducted on the drug. Then, in 2008, the Thalidomide Trust, inEngland, headed by Dr. Martin Johnson, located a group of Nazi-era documents[endnotes.xhtml#en1215] that produced a link between thalidomide and the drugsresearched and developed by IG Farben chemists during the war. Dr. Johnsonpoints out [endnotes.xhtml#en1216] that Grünenthal’s 1954 patents forthalidomide cryptically state that human trials had already been completed, butthe company says it cannot offer that data because it was lost, ostensiblyduring the war. “The patents suggest that thalidomide [endnotes.xhtml#en1217]was probably one of a number of products developed at Dyhernfurth orAuschwitz-Monowitz under the leadership of Otto Ambros in the course of nervegas research,” Dr. Johnson says.The Thalidomide Trust also links Paperclip scientist Richard Kuhn to the medicaltragedy. “Kuhn worked with a wide range of chemicals in his nerve gas research,and in his antidote research we know he used Antergan, which we are fairly surewas a ‘sister drug’ to Contergan,” the brand name for thalidomide, Dr. Johnsonexplains.In 2005, Kuhn experienced a posthumous fall from grace when the Society ofGerman Chemists (Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker, GDCh) announced it would nolonger award its once-prestigious Richard Kuhn Medal in his name. Nazi-eradocuments on Kuhn had been brought to the society’s attention, revealing that in“the spring of 1943 Kuhn asked [endnotes.xhtml#en1218] the secretary-general ofthe KWS [Kaiser Wilhelm Society], Ernst Telschow, to support his search for thebrains of ‘young and healthy men,’ presumably for nerve gas research.” TheSociety of German Chemists maintains that “the sources indicate that thesebrains were most likely taken from execution victims,” and that “[d]espite hisscientific achievements, [Richard] Kuhn is not suitable to serve as a rolemodel, and eponym for an important award, mainly due to his research on poisongas, but also due to his conduct towards Jewish colleagues.”It seems that the legacy of Hitler’s chemists has yet to be fully unveiled.Because so many of these German scientists were seen as assets to the U.S. ArmyChemical Corps’ nerve agent programs, and were thus wanted as participants inOperation Paperclip, secret deals were made, and the many documents pertaining[endnotes.xhtml#en1219] to these arrangements were classified. PresidentClinton’s Interagency Working Group had access to eight million pages ofdeclassified documents, but millions more documents remain classified. In U.S.Intelligence and the Nazis, the Interagency Working Group’s authors write that“the truest reckoning with the official past can never be complete without thefull release of government records.”Part of the problem lies in identifying where records are physically located.For example, a 2012 FOIA request to the State Department, asking for the releaseof all files related to Otto Ambros, was denied on the grounds that no suchfiles exist. But it is a matter of record, owing to a May 1971 news article inthe Jewish Telegraphic Agency, that Otto Ambros traveled to the United Statestwice with the State Department’s assistance, despite his status as a convictedwar criminal. In an interview with State Department official Fred Scott, theJewish Telegraphic Agency learned, “Ambros came to the United States in 1967[endnotes.xhtml#en1220] after the State Department recommended to the JusticeDepartment a waiver on his eligibility, which was granted,” and that in 1969,Ambros received a second visa waiver and traveled to the United States again. Inthe spring of 1971 Ambros was attempting to get a third visa waiver from theState Department when the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported the story.According to Fred Scott, Ambros’s host for his May 1971 visit was listed as theDow Chemical Company. After the story was published, Jewish groups heldprotests, and Ambros allegedly canceled his trip. But none of this informationis contained in Ambros’s declassified U.S. Army files, FBI files, or CIA files.Otto Ambros was a convicted Nazi war criminal. In accordance with the Nazi WarCrimes Disclosure Act, all files about him should have been released anddeclassified. But records that cannot be located cannot be declassified. Whereare the Otto Ambros records hidden? And what secrets might be guarded therein?Names and dates continue to come to light, and researchers, journalists, andhistorians continue to uncover new facts. Fate and circumstance also inevitablyplay a part. In 2010 a cache of almost three hundred documents was found in theattic of a house being renovated in the Polish town of Oświȩcim, nearAuschwitz. The documents include information about several Nazi doctors andFarben chemists who worked at the death camp. “The sensational value[endnotes.xhtml#en1221] of this discovery is the fact that these originaldocuments, bearing the names of the main murderers from Auschwitz, were found somany years after the war,” says Adam Cyra, a historian at the Auschwitz museum.Otto Ambros lived until 1990, to the age of ninety-two. After his death, thechemical conglomerate BASF, on whose board of directors he had served, laudedhim as “an expressive entrepreneurial figure [endnotes.xhtml#en1222] of greatcharisma.” Is the old German proverb really true? Jedem das Seine. Does everyoneget what he deserves?Still, as of 2013, the Space Medicine Association in America continues to bestowits prestigious Hubertus Strughold Award to a scientist or specialist foroutstanding contribution to aviation medicine. It has done so every year since1963. On December 1, 2012, the Wall Street Journal ran a page-one story[endnotes.xhtml#en1223] about Dr. Strughold, presenting revelatory newinformation about his criminal activities during the war. German historian Prof.Hans-Walter Schmuhl had been researching another subject when he came acrossevidence [endnotes.xhtml#en1224] that showed that Dr. Strughold had allowedepileptic children to be experimented on inside the high-altitude chamber atStrughold’s Aviation Medical Research Institute of the Reich Air Ministry inBerlin. Rabbits had been put to the test first and had died. Next, Reich medicalresearchers wanted to see what would happen to young children with epilepsysubjected to those same conditions. Strughold authorized the potentially lethaltests on the children. “The head of the Institute is responsible,” says Schmuhl;“using this expensive equipment, the head of an institute had to have beeninformed about the use.” When the German Society for Air and Space Medicinelearned about Schmuhl’s discovery, they eliminated their prestigious StrugholdAward, which had been given annually in Germany since the mid-1970s.In America, the Wall Street Journal article renewed debate as to why the SpaceMedicine Association had not yet eliminated its Hubertus Strughold Award. Dr.Mark Campbell, a former president of the Space Medicine Association, insists theaward will not go away. Campbell blames the Internet [endnotes.xhtml#en1225] formaligning what he sees as Dr. Strughold’s good character. “I was a member of acommittee investigating Dr. Strughold to see if his name should be removed fromthe Space Medicine Association Strughold Award,” says Campbell. “I was amazed tofind that the facts that were uncovered were so different from the claims beingmade on the Internet.” But most of Dr. Campbell’s colleagues disagree. “Whydefend him? [endnotes.xhtml#en1226]” asks Dr. Stephen Véronneau, a researchmedical officer at the FAA’s Civil Aerospace Medical Institute in Oklahoma City,and a member of the Space Medicine Association. “I can’t find another example inthe world of [an institution] honoring Dr. Strughold except my own association.”The National Space Club Florida Committee, one of three committees of theNational Space Club in Washington, D.C., gives out a similarly prestigiousspace-related award called the Dr. Kurt H. Debus Award. This annual award isnamed in honor of Operation Paperclip’s Kurt Debus, who became the firstdirector of the Kennedy Space Center. Kurt Debus is the scientist who, duringthe war, was an enthusiastic member of the SS, wore the SS uniform to work, andturned a colleague over to the Gestapo for making anti-Nazi remarks and failingto give Debus the Nazi salute. Under Operation Paperclip, Kurt Debus worked onmissiles for the army and for NASA for a total of twenty-eight years—many ofwhich he spent alongside Arthur Rudolph and Wernher von Braun. Kurt Debusretired in 1974. In 2013, after the Strughold award debate resurfaced, Iinterviewed Steve Griffin, the National Space Club chairman, to determine whythe organization continues to give out an award that is named after someone whowas once an avowed and active Nazi.“Simple as it is, Kurt Debus is an honored American [endnotes.xhtml#en1227],”Griffin says. I read to Griffin information from Kurt Debus’s OMGUS securityreport. “It is a simple matter,” Griffin told me. “Kurt Debus was the firstdirector of the Kennedy Space Center.”Unlike the Strughold award, which was created in 1963 when Strughold’s foreignscientist case file was still classified, the Dr. Kurt H. Debus Award was firstbestowed in 1990, after Debus’s OMGUS security report had been declassified andthe revelation that he was an active member of Heinrich Himmler’s SS had beenrevealed. “It is not my purview to decide if we have an award or what it iscalled,” Griffin says. But Griffin conceded that he has been on the board of theNational Space Club since the Debus award’s inception, so technically it is, andalways has been, within his purview. Like so many of those involved in OperationPaperclip decades ago, Griffin looks past Debus’s former commitment to NaziParty ideology. He only sees the scientist.“What do you say when people ask you about Kurt Debus’s Nazi past?” I asked.“Not a single person has asked me this question in [twenty-three] years,”Griffin said.To report this book, I filed dozens of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)requests, some of which were honored, many of which were denied, and most ofwhich are still pending. I came across oblique references, circa 1945, regardinga supposed list of Nazi doctors whom the Office of U.S. Chief of Counsel, U.S.Army, sought for involvement in “mercy killings,” or medical murder crimes. FOIArequests for the list turned up nothing. Then, at the Harvard Medical Library, Ifound a collection of papers that once belonged to Colonel Robert J. Benford,the first commander of Operation Paperclip’s aviation medicine research programat the Army Air Forces Aero Medical Center in Heidelberg. Benford, with Dr.Strughold, oversaw the work of the fifty-eight Nazi doctors at the center; bothBenford and Strughold worked under Colonel Harry Armstrong. In Benford’s papersI came across a file labeled “List of Personnel Involved in Medical Research andMercy Killings,” but the access to the file was “Restricted Until 2015.” TheHarvard Medical Library informed me that the Department of Defense hadclassified the list and that only the DoD had the authority to declassify it.Harvard filed a FOIA request on my behalf, and the “mercy killings” list wasdeclassified and released to me.Included on this list, which had been in Colonel Benford’s possession, wereseven Nazi doctors hired under Operation Paperclip: Theodor Benzinger, KurtBlome, Konrad Schäfer, Walter Schreiber, Hermann Becker-Freyseng, SiegfriedRuff, and Oskar Schröder. The fact became instantly clear: U.S. Armyintelligence knew all along that these doctors were implicated in murder yetchose to classify the list [endnotes.xhtml#en1228] and hire the doctors forOperation Paperclip. Blome, Schäfer, Becker-Freyseng, Ruff, and Schröder wereall tried at Nuremberg. Schreiber’s public outing in 1951 and his subsequentbanishment from America are now on record. Dr. Theodor Benzinger seems to haveslipped away from accountability.From his New York Times obituary in 1999 [endnotes.xhtml#en1229], the worldlearned that Dr. Theodor Benzinger, 94, invented the ear thermometer, a nominalcontribution to the medical world. As for the military world, Benzinger’sresearch work for the navy was destroyed or remains classified as of 2013.Wernher von Braun, Arthur Rudolph, Kurt Debus, and Hubertus Strughold led theAmerican effort to get man to the moon. The question remains, despite a man’scontribution to a nation or a people, how do we interpret a fundamental wrong?Is the American government at fault equally for fostering myths about itsPaperclip scientists—for encouraging them to whitewash their past so that theirscientific acumen could be exploited for U.S. weapons-related work? When, for anation, should the end justify the means? These are questions that can only beanswered separately, by individuals. But as facts emerge and history isclarified, the answers become more suitably informed.In addition to the ear thermometer, Theodor Benzinger left the world with thePlanck-Benzinger equation, fine-tuning the second law of thermodynamics, whichstates that nothing lasts. Benzinger’s lifelong scientific pursuit[endnotes.xhtml#en1230] was studying entropy—the idea that chaos rules the worldand, like ice melting in a warm room, order leads to disorder.I prefer Gerhard Maschkowski’s take on what matters and what lasts. Maschkowskiwas the Jewish teenager fortuitously spared the gas chamber at Auschwitz becausehe was of use to IG Farben as a slave laborer at their Buna factory. I wasinterviewing Maschkowski one spring afternoon in 2012 when I asked him thequestion, “What matters, what lasts?” He chuckled and smiled. He pushed back thesleeve on his shirt and showed me his blue-ink Auschwitz tattoo. “This lasts,[endnotes.xhtml#en1231]” he said. “But it is also a record of [the] truth.”"},{"pageContent":"Book Title Page [images/Art_INS01.jpg]Major General Dr. Walter Schreiber was the surgeon general of the Third Reich.“The most sinister crime in which Schreiber is involved is the introduction ofintravenous lethal phenol injections,” explained war crimes investigator Dr.Leopold Alexander, “as a quick and convenient means of executing troublemakers.”Paperclip contracts: U.S. Army, Camp King, Germany; U.S. Air Force, Texas.(NARA)"},{"pageContent":"Book Title Page [images/Art_INS02.jpg]Dr. Kurt Blome was Hitler’s biological weapons maker and the deputy surgeongeneral of the Third Reich.

Byhis own admission, he spends a good deal of his time thinking philosophicallyabout concepts of “identity,” “science,” “time,” and “life.” When I first methim, Dirk Knemeyer shared with me that he had never before spoken publicly abouthis grandfather’s wartime activities, and that most members of his family go outof their way to maintain silence about Siegfried Knemeyer’s high ranking in theNazi Party. “For the most part the family’s position is: Do not discussSiegfried’s [past] with anyone, particularly not a journalist,” Dirk Knemeyersays. “But what do you do when you have documents in your attic, as I do,praising your grandfather and his excellent work, and signed by people likeHermann Göring and Albert Speer?”I find no easy answer to this question. The conundrum therein is one of thenotions that made me want to learn much more about Operation Paperclip.“Siegfried’s life is complicated,” Dirk Knemeyer says of his grandfather. “I amsomeone [who is] more interested in learning the truth about the past thandenying it. Besides, some things are unwise to ignore.”I asked Knemeyer if he would share with me some of his grandfather’s documentsthat were stored in boxes in his own attic. He said he would think about it.Eventually he agreed. Thank you, Dirk Knemeyer.I wish to thank Dr. Götz Blome, Gabriella Hoffmann, Paul-Hermann Schieber, andRolf Benzinger for their time and their transparency. The indomitable JohnDolibois, whom I admire: Thank you for taking the time with me on so manydifferent points. Dr. Jens Westemeier assisted me with all things German in thisbook and located some very difficult to find documents in numerous Germanarchives; thank you, Jens. I thank the author and historian Clarence Lasby forsharing his insights with me. Lasby first began his book Project Paperclip:German Scientists and the Cold War (1971) in the 1960s, as an extension of hiscollege thesis—decades before the truth about the German scientists’ Nazi pastwas revealed under the Freedom of Information Act. Lasby’s access to documentswas seminal. As we have seen, many of these documents have since disappearedfrom various collections—been destroyed or lost.In addition to interviews and oral history recordings, the foundations of thisbook are from military and civilian archives in the United States and Germany.Countless individuals were helpful, the following notably so: Lynn O.

Riot police commissioner Mathias Korn and police historian Anna Naab tookme around the expansive former SS training area grounds, which are adjacent tothe Dachau concentration camp, including areas not open to the public. Thanks tothem, I was able to go into the buildings used by the U.S. military to prosecutethe Dachau war crimes trials, and to see where Georg Rickhey was tried andacquitted. Dr. Harald Eichinger, the warden of Landsberg Prison, gave me acomprehensive tour of that famous facility (still in use today), where Hitlerwrote Mein Kampf and where the convicted Nuremberg war criminals were brieflyimprisoned—until they were either hanged or granted clemency by U.S. HighCommissioner John J. McCloy.An author is nothing without a team.

There exists afamous and controversial story about McCloy when he was the assistant secretaryof war (Bird, 214–23). Toward the end of the war, Nahum Goldmann, president ofthe World Jewish Congress, read in the New York Times that between July 7, 1944,and November 20, 1944, ten fleets with sometimes more than three hundred heavybombers had bombed targets within thirty-five miles of Auschwitz. Goldmann wentto see John McCloy at his office in the Pentagon to appeal to the assistantsecretary of war, who was able to bring recommendations to European commanders.According to Goldmann, he pleaded with McCloy for Auschwitz to be bombed, sayingsome would die but a hundred thousand lives might be saved. McCloy said therewas little he could do and instead passed off Goldmann to his Britishcounterpart in Washington, Sir John Dill. Goldmann met with Dill, who alsorejected the idea, arguing that bombs needed to be saved for important militarytargets. A second appeal was made to McCloy: to destroy “the execution chambersand crematories at [Auschwitz] Birkenau through direct bombing action.” McCloyturned the matter over to an American lieutenant general named John Hull forquick evaluation; no commanders in Europe were consulted. Hull rejected theappeal, claiming, “The target is beyond the maximum range of medium bombardment,dive bombers and fighter bombers located in the United Kingdom, France orItaly”—a statement, Bird reminds readers, that was contrary to the facts.Goldmann pointed out that the Royal Air Force had already targeted IG Farben’sBuna factory, which was four miles away from the gas chambers.deliberate, shameless murderers [chapter017.xhtml#ien0969]: Bird, 331.McCloy never responded [chapter017.xhtml#ien0970]: Ibid.Peck Panel [chapter017.xhtml#ien0971]: David W.

The scene was allegedly setin Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, in the days or weeks after the end of thewar. “This [American] General covered in full medals asked Dornberger, ‘Are youthe guy who was in charge of development of the V-2 rockets?’ ” Strughold quotedDornberger as saying. “He [Dornberger] said, ‘Ja wohl, Herr General. Yes,General.’ Then [Patton] gave [Dornberger] three cigars and said, ‘MyCongratulations. I could not have done it [myself]!’ Dornberger told me thisstory himself,” said Strughold (Hasdorff, 19–20).distortion of reality [chapter021.xhtml#ien1177]: RG 330 Hubertus Strughold,JIOA Form No. 2, Basic Personnel Record.CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO: LEGACYlarge-scale public trial [chapter022.xhtml#ien1178]: Pendas, 1–3.“The trial was triggered” [chapter022.xhtml#ien1179]: Hermann Langbein narratesthis story in Verdict on Auschwitz (2007), directed by Rolf Bickel and DietrichWagner.

The fate of Wilhelm Beiglböck is worth noting. Hewas the Nazi doctor who performed seawater experiments at Dachau, and he removeda piece of Karl Höllenrainer’s liver without anesthesia. Convicted and sentencedto fifteen years in Landsberg Prison, he was granted clemency by U.S. HighCommissioner John McCloy in 1951. Within a year, Beiglböck was back practicingmedicine, at a hospital in Buxtehude, Germany, thanks to a former SS colleague,August Dietrich “Dieter” Allers, who ran the hospital. Beiglböck publishedmedical papers and enjoyed prominence in the German medical community until1962, when he traveled to his native Vienna to give a lecture. In Austria, therewere open war crimes charges against Beiglböck, and he was arrested. Back inGermany, and likely as a result of attention from the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial,Dieter Allers was arrested around the same time. With no job to return to at thehospital, Beiglböck committed suicide on November 22, 1963. He was fifty-eightyears old. He left all of his money to Die Stille Hilfe, or Silent Help, aclandestine society that Allers ran. It provided aid to fugitive SS members(Weindling, 309, 315).CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE: WHAT LASTS?“I do not reproach” [chapter023.xhtml#ien1201]: Michel, 98.Rudolph relates [chapter023.xhtml#ien1202]: Ordway and Sharpe, 70–71, 77–79;Neufeld, Von Braun, 471.Rosenbaum later recalled [chapter023.xhtml#ien1203]: Feigin, 2.Arthur Rudolph’s activities [chapter023.xhtml#ien1204]: Feigin, 300–342.One of Rudolph’s leading proponents [chapter023.xhtml#ien1205]: Hunt,photographic insert opposite page 149.“not a single document” [chapter023.xhtml#ien1206]: Neufeld, The Rocket and theReich, 186–87, 227.“There is little doubt” [chapter023.xhtml#ien1207]: Telephone interview withMichael Neufeld, April 3, 2013.

On April 12, 1943, “Rudolph took atour of the Heinkel aircraft plant and returned to Peenemünde excited about theuse of slave labor,” says Neufeld, notably because it offered partnership withthe SS and “greater protection for secrecy.”a bill for $239,680 [chapter023.xhtml#ien1208]: Hunt’s book, Secret Agenda: TheUnited States Government, Nazi Scientists, and Project Paperclip, 1945–1990, waspreceded by a book by British journalist Tom Bower, The Paperclip Conspiracy:The Hunt for the Nazi Scientists, for which Bower accessed unreported storiesfrom both American and British archives.
