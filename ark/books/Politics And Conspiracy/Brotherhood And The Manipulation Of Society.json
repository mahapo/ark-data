Through no fault of ours or theirs, our parents begin the programming process as their views of life, shaped by their education, employment and the media are imposed on us. Formal education through schools, colleges and universities continues the systematic indoctrination where the 'correct' views and interpretations of science, history and society result in exam passes and the ability to 'get on' in life. Alternative views and the rejection of establishment education lead to supposedly lesser jobs and a struggle against economic poverty. Our entire understanding of the world and current affairs is filtered through the mass media, interpreted by journalists and so-called experts. Their views become our views simply because we are not offered any alternatives. To overcome daily problems within society we turn to elected representatives of our community. We give our decision-making abilities to these few people who are increasingly remote, as local council power is removed to national government and ever more to Europe. Our experience of life is determined by the framework around our society. The basic premise is that the goal of each individual should be to become a minute part in the global machine of consumerism led by Western multinational corporations and banks. Every other consideration is subordinate to the prime motivation of profit. Obviously, those in the positions of influence – politicians, bankers, corporate executives, media moguls – have been, according to their own definition, 'successful' within the System, so have an interest in maintaining the status quo at all costs. This framework shapes every aspect of our life through education, the media, health care, cultural and sporting events, religion etc. With these framing conditions in place, the System regulates itself: individuals with attitudes that suit the perpetuation of the System achieve status and influence within it; those who accept the establishment rules soon find ways to impose those rules; those who are blind to the exploitative realities of consumerism attain positions to promote it. Regardless of how the framework came to be imposed, the truth is that the same attitudes control education, media, governments and banks and therefore exert an irrepressible influence over every aspect of our lives, our thoughts and opinions."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The vast majority of the world's population are merely sheep happily following the herd. Whatever is broadcast in the media as being desirable to the masses suddenly and miraculously becomes desired by the masses. Whatever our neighbour owns or achieves becomes the object of great envy and we lust to acquire what we believe to be ours by right. Thus, when we are shown a solution to a problem, any old solution to anything which interferes with our need to follow the latest trends, we accept it without question and cease to seek any further for ourselves. Problems abound and so do solutions; but it is the easiest and most profitable proffered option which is seized by the majority whilst the minority are trampled underfoot in the stampede to acquire the latest object of idolatry. And just like sheep who follow blindly and without question the direction of the herd, we are led through the gates of a pen to be confined at the shepherds convenience until it is time for the final journey, once again without hesitation and happy in the knowledge that we are with the 'in-crowd', through the gates of the slaughterhouse However, this framework has not been constructed by chance or appeared by accident. It is a deliberate policy which has been implemented over the centuries and continues with ever more sinister repercussions today. It is the identities of these shepherds, their methods and motivation with which the following chapter is concerned. Since Biblical times, the esoteric knowledge, outlined briefly in this book, has been largely withheld from the majority of people throughout the world. Initially, this information was the remnant of Atlantean knowledge but was gradually dispersed and further diluted by cataclysmic events such as the Great Flood. Throughout the ages, lost information has been returned to the collective consciousness of mankind via prophets and channellers. Great Mystery Schools, such as the Essene order, set themselves apart in order to carry forward this knowledge via carefully selected initiates. These initiates were the mystics and magi as well as the scholars, healers and philosophers, such as Pythagoras, who, it is said, was very much influenced by the Druid culture. Secrecy was maintained by these orders to avoid persecution and to prevent the very powerful information from falling into the hands of those who would use it for imbalanced reasons. Knowledge was concealed within myth and fable, often passed between generations by word of mouth alone, as in the case of the Celtic Druids. Any written documents were careful ciphered, with the keys to the code known only to selected initiates. Covens formed throughout the world and maintained secrecy through secret signals and codes which would reveal their meeting places. This practice persists today amongst secret orders such as occultists and Freemasons etc.. Eventually, a large number of sects, which were initially sub-divisions of essentially the same orders, began to lose sight of the original purity of their doctrines. Gradual misinterpretation of codes and myths as well as the uprising of egotistical desires caused many of the groups to become separated in their intent; some of these have developed into cult organisations and religions. Luciferic influence has seen to it that most dogmatic religion owes more to misunderstanding of basic truths than anything else. Differences are amplified and seen as more important to followers of such creeds than the common ties between them – all due to misinterpretation of the same fundamental knowledge. All of the world's major religions share a pagan origin but have gradually moved their sights further and further to the left of the centre where Truth inevitably lies. Despite this, some of the purer mystery schools have survived through the ages in areas all over the world. The ancient Egyptian magicians, the ancient Greek philosophers, the Celtic Druids, American Indian shamen, Australian aboriginal shaman and oriental magicians have all possessed arcane knowledge pertaining to the true nature of Creation. Initiates were often revered as holy men by the laity and were spared the distractions of daily life in order to keep alive the flames of the inherent magic of life. However, within certain of the more secretive societies, the Luciferic consciousness has managed to take hold with disastrous consequences for mankind. For millennia, human history has been a chronicle of the power struggle of man against man and of man"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"against nature. In his over-physical five-sense-perception state, that which man could acquire for himself as an individual has been the main motivating factor, often seen as essential for survival. Survival has been perceived as for the fittest, the most powerful, the wealthiest and this has perpetuated imbalance all the way to its most bitter conclusions which are war, bondage and persecution. Domination through conflict and might over meekness has seen aeons of feudalism and social hierarchy in the worst possible expressions. To perpetuate their claim of deserved superiority over the masses, the rulers of the past have explored innumerable ways to achieve their goals, both subtle and violent. One method has been recognised as being the most effective and has been employed by the ruling aristocracy throughout the world since pre-history right up to the present day through governments, businesses and monarchies. That is, by keeping the masses in ignorance of their true potential and power; to keep them at a low level of education, preoccupying their minds away from who they truly are from birth; to manipulate them via a systematic education programme, in all areas of their existence, into channelling their lives in pursuit of handing over power to their rulers. If this can be done in such a way that the masses have no recourse and believe this condition to be the only way to live, then they will be highly unlikely to challenge the status quo. The present System has been engineered throughout the ages by these imbalanced secret societies in order to perpetuate their wealth and power. It is they who designed the System and it is only they who know every individual link in the chains which have kept us in bondage for millennia. Today we have a global network of secret societies, initiates into the 'Mysteries', whose only motivation is to serve the Luciferic consciousness. How many times have we heard such phrases as 'It's the money men who really rule the world', but how many of us realise the accuracy of this sentiment and its full implications? Armed with vast amounts of wealth and esoteric knowledge, the negative secret society network has flourished as the aristocracy of the world. Power, wealth and information has been gained and maintained via warfare, exploitation, and especially in the last century, through control of the world's economic systems. Collectively these organisations, led by the self-appointed global Elite, have become known as the 'Brotherhood'. These days, initiation into the various secret societies which form the Brotherhood is relatively easy. Potential initiates are hand picked and invited to join certain exclusive clubs, such as the Freemasons and certain mutually beneficial business cartels which are merely Brotherhood front organisations. Candidates are tempted with the promise that, once accepted into the organisation, many personal advantages would be on offer: improved career prospects with promotion easier to achieve, more prosperous lifestyles and obstacles to success would be made to disappear. In other words this mutually beneficial 'old-boy network' would take care of its own. The only way for the Brotherhood to prosper is to keep the world in ignorance of who they really are. By convincing people that they are little more than robots, they can use those robots to perpetuate their power base. Power always seeks power and will never stop until all power is focused solely in the hands of the most ambitious. In the last century, with the acceleration in technological development, particularly in terms of communication, the Elite have sought to realise their ambitions more swiftly with more blatant and definable aims: the creation of a World Government; a world currency and bank; a world army; the control of public opinion culminating in a microchipped population connected to a central computer; the destruction of any alternatives to their System; and to make huge amounts of money in the process. This sinister plan by the Elite has become popularly known by researchers as the New World Order. The situation within the hierarchy of the Elite is necessarily complex as the activities are concealed behind a large number of front organisations of varying degrees of secrecy. Everything is based upon the pyramid principle with the very few Elite at the apex as the All-Seeing-Eye and ultimate controllers right down to those at the bottom who, in the largest numbers, have no idea about the true agenda which is being ministered to them from above. Through the levels of initiation from the bottom to the top, only the most"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"ambitious and ruthless are filtered out to occupy more and more select positions of power and knowledge of the ultimate agenda. This is further enforced at each step of the pyramid by the process of COMPARTMENTALISATION which is the operation of the 'need to know' principle; this way even those upon the same level of the pyramid know very little of their fellow initiate's business and role within the overall plan. The vast majority of people working to further the Elite's aims of a New World Order, do so unknowingly but others whose names constantly recur will have a pretty good idea of what is happening. The USA was founded by the Elite for the very reason of executing the plan to control the world. It is this nation which is the hub of its wheel of influence. Christopher Columbus and his voyage was backed and financed by the Brotherhood, with his ships' sails bearing a red cross on a white background, the symbol of the Knights Templar (the chivalric order who went on to become the Freemasons etc., whose symbol is the red rose or cross upon a white background which represents blood and semen in Satanic ritual). Almost a century before Columbus, the Templars had reached North America and had already begun trading with and exploiting the native nations there. Since its 'discovery', the history of the USA has been the history of ethnic cleansing, imposition of power, slavery, mass exploitation and the worship of wealth. The U.S. president, generally accepted as the most powerful man in the world, is a slave to his prime allegiance, the Brotherhood. Even he is probably not a top-level member as it is wiser to hide behind the tools of corruption in anonymity and to pull the strings in this way. I do not seek to condemn these people for their beliefs – everyone should be free to develop their own belief system – but I feel that they are seriously misguided in the ways they seek to impose them on the majority and conceal the truth. They have allowed themselves to become slaves to and also the major implementers the Luciferic consciousness which has taken this planet to the brink of destruction. Presenting the information concisely is a difficult operation due to the complexity of the interconnections between people, organisations and events. I have attempted to simplify the situation into a manageable amount but it remains merely the tip of the iceberg. It should be remembered also that nothing is black and white, no one is 'good' or 'evil' – such simple distinctions are part of the manipulation which encourages us to judge our neighbours in order to create conflict. part 1 THE MAIN MANIPULATING GROUPS Freemasonry The basic recruitment of members to further the Elite's plans is through the secret society network of Freemasonry which is the latest incarnation of the Christian/military order known as the Knights Templars who gained staggering riches and a wealth of esoteric knowledge during the Crusades, in which the 'righteous' Christians were dispatched to the Holy Land with free reign to slaughter the Jews and Moslems in a series of campaigns between the 11 th and 13 th Centuries. The vast majority of members are on the first three rungs of the thirty-three level hierarchy and have no idea of the hidden agenda. Once initiated into the lowest level – the first of thirty three degrees – vows are taken to pledge allegiance to the society above all else. Most initiates are willing to do this as the temptation of power, wealth and knowledge is hard to refuse. It is hinted that there are penalties to pay for betraying their society and revealing its secrets but at this level the organisation is viewed by its members as little more than a secretive social club with a morality based upon chivalry. Certain of what appear to be esoteric secrets are revealed to them upon initiation as a 'taster' for what is to come as long as the initiate remains faithful to the order. Money is then paid by the initiate in order to progress to the second degree through a ceremony involving the revelation of yet further secret knowledge with the promise of more to come at each stage."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Initiation into higher degrees requires increasingly larger sums of money and still the clues keep coming; promises of wonderful arcane knowledge are continual yet the actual knowledge revealed remains encoded and only serves to whet the appetite. No one is ever given the full scenario, only pieces of what appears to be a picture of the most awesome significance. As more and more is revealed and the higher up the ladder the initiate is allowed, the greater are the personal perks provided and doorways opened in terms of career and social status. Moreover, the warnings against transgression of the secret society's rules become blatant and more sinister at each step. It is impossible to achieve high levels of initiation within Freemasonry unless one is hand picked by those of the higher degrees. In order to do this, one must meet their criteria of wealth, status, social class and character type. By the time the twentieth degree is reached a minimum of professional level income is required to fund progression through the system. The result of this financially dependent progression is that the top level members of the Brotherhood elite are among the richest, and most powerfully influential people in the world. They are also responsible, directly and indirectly for most of the money/power based crime such as the illegal drugs industry, political assassinations, Satanism and mind control which goes on every day, all round the world. At the apex of the pyramid of the Brotherhood are the select few who actually know the full agenda of the organisation. These privileged elite have become known as the 'Illuminati', which is Latin for 'illuminated ones'. All other members (nearly five million world-wide) are ignorant of the true purpose of their individual organisation as a front for the Illuminati. Only the most suitable are selected to rise in the ranks, those recognised as being wealthy, ambitious and corrupt enough to perpetuate the ultimate goal which is world domination. No one but the Illuminati actually knows anything of importance and therefore cannot betray the game plan. Everyone else provides a front, a smoke screen of ignorance and misinformation and all must offer complete obedience to the will of their organisation or be banished (or worse). The same thing also happens in our universities whereby particularly talented scholars are approached with magnificent offers of wealth and status in order to follow unofficial secret research programs into such topics as UFOs, psychic warfare and advanced energy sources. Betrayal of the Brotherhood is the worst crime possible in the eyes of its members and is ultimately punishable by death. The Brotherhood is all powerful: all top level members of the police and military forces around the world are placed there through the Brotherhood as Brotherhood tools. Judges and lawyers, media moguls, businessmen and politicians are recruited so that no member of the Brotherhood elite is ever in danger of being held accountable by the System for any crime or misdemeanour. The Brotherhood can, and quite literally does, get away with murder because it is also the law which opposes it. If a non-Brotherhood member should slip through the net and achieve high status then there are ways to ensure that such people are unable to achieve their full potential. For example, I doubt if Prince Charles will ever fulfil his right of kingship as he has publicly refused to enrol with the Freemasons. It infiltrates every area of our society at all levels, but at the top, in the highest social and monetary bracket, the Brotherhood prevails almost in total. It is the single largest vehicle for the perpetuation of the Luciferic consciousness on Earth. One of the ways by which the faithfulness of members is ensured, especially in the higher levels is by the insistence that the initiated give details of their most intimate secrets to the organisation, so that if any transgression of the rules were to occur then this information would be revealed and used to publicly destroy the individual concerned. As an example of this, one Masonic branch, the Skull and Bones Society, centred around the Harvard and Yale universities, was founded on opium money, is blatantly racist, has some particularly bizarre rituals including an initiation which includes lying in a coffin with a ribbon tied around the genitalia whilst masturbating and shouting out one's greatest sexual fantasies. It boasts amongst its members (who, remember, swear complete allegiance to the society above all other commitments) George Bush, Percy Rockefeller, Winston Lord (one time CFR chairman) and nine members of the board of the Morgan Guaranty Trust (see House of Rothschild). Also associated with Freemasonry within the Elite's own hierarchy are other esoteric societies such as the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Grand Orient Lodges, the Knights of Malta, the Knights Templar, P2 and the Black Nobility. The Brotherhood owns the law, they own the military, they own the oil companies, pharmaceutical companies and just about everything which provides fuel for the status quo. It sets the standards for education, it sets the curriculum, it plants seeds via the media and education systems of what will later become, through tender nurturing, power hungry, dis-satisfied, spiritually unaware slaves to their System. If it was not so sinister it would be purely perfect in its all encompassing design. While the first three degree Masons and Round Table members are raising money for charity and enjoying relatively harmless social events, their superiors in the Craft are organising wars, drug pushing, co-ordinating assassinations, mind-control, raping and murdering young children in Satanic abuse and formulating plans for world domination. History has convinced me that it is possible to get away with virtually any crime as long as it is on a large enough scale. The U.S. presidents, also thirty-third degree Masons, are financed into the position not as leaders of men but as a tool of the Brotherhood. All allegiance come secondary to the bonds within their secret society, on pain of death. Political systems are also a front for the Brotherhood elite. Not as representatives of the people, elected by the people, for the people, but as tools of and for the Brotherhood. Science is controlled to the benefit of the elite, wars are created and manipulated to the benefit of the elite. Every time a bomb is dropped or a tank built, ultimately it is the multi-national businesses who profit, especially the oil industries and world bankers. All is Brotherhood controlled. The scale of the manipulation in all areas of the status quo is almost immeasurable and for this reason virtually unbelievable to most prisoners of the System. The Round Table The Round Table was established in the 1891 as a Masonic-like secret society to manipulate events to lead to a centralised global government. The leading lights were Cecil Rhodes, whose wealth largely derived from the exploitation of South African diamond reserves, and Alfred Milner, a Rothschild agent who took over after the death of Rhodes. Financial backing also came from the Rockefellers. Groups were established throughout the world, working behind the scenes through a co-ordination of world banks in order to bring pressure on governments to promote the New World Order. As well as Milner, who effectively controlled Lloyd George's War Cabinet during the Great War, members in the first half of this century included Arthur Balfour (then Foreign Secretary, later Prime Minister and whose Balfour Declaration created the State of Israel); Lord Astor who owned The Times ; and Nathan Rothschild, Governor of the Bank of England. After WW1, the Round Table was instrumental in the formation of the League Of Nations, the forerunner of the Elite-controlled United Nations. Rhodes' legacy includes a bequeathal of funds for the financial sponsorship of selected overseas students who attend Oxford University to be sold the New World Order. These 'Rhodes Scholars' include Bill Clinton. The influence of the Round Table and that of the various groups it has spawned is prevalent today, although the majority of members will have no idea of what they are involved in. Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA) One of the more public Round Table creations is the Royal Institute of International Affairs which is based at Chatham House in London and was formed in 1920 by the Anglo/American delegations from the Treaty of Versailles meetings. Prominent in the British delegation was Alfred Milner. The RIIA's patron is the Queen of England. Supposedly, the RIIA is a 'think tank' but in effect it determines British policy. And yet, its membership list"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"is never divulged and it is shrouded in secrecy. Information that has been obtained reveals that its current joint presidents are Lord Carrington (former Foreign Secretary, director-general of NATO and close business partner of Henry Kissinger), Lord James Callaghan (former Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister) and Lord Roy Jenkins (former Chancellor of the Exchequer and president of the European Commission). Funding is derived from its corporate members which is a vast list including government departments, petrochemical companies (who also fund its Environment Programme!), merchant and high street banks, newspapers, television stations, the Church of England, Amnesty International ...etc.. Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) In 1921, funded by the Rockefellers, the RIIA founded its American wing – known as the Council on Foreign Relations. As its membership is marginally more public than its British counterpart it is clearly seen that anyone who has had any influence on American or global politics ever since has been a member of the CFR. This includes 14 of the last 18 US Secretaries of State; the previous eight CIA directors; the majority of presidential and vice-presidential candidates including Eisenhower, Nixon, Carter, Mondale, Ford, Nelson Rockefeller, Bush and Clinton. The Bilderberg Group (Bil) This was convened for the first time in May 1954 by Polish socialist Joseph Retinger, a major voice behind the European Union. Also instrumental in its creation was Prince Bernhard of the House of Orange in the Netherlands (former German SS officer an spy via chemical company I.G. Farben and who later became chairman of Shell Oil). It was to be a group of leading politicians and their advisors, executives from media, banking and multinational corporations, educationalists and military leaders who would meet to discuss the global future by addressing matters of critical importance in an off-the-record manner so that the distractions of politics could be kept out of the way.. The group has since met annually in strict secrecy and despite the considerable high level media representation in the group the meetings are never reported. Leading the group is an unelected steering committee, the chairman of which since 1991 has been Lord Carrington. Members outside this committee probably do not know the agenda towards which the group is working and are merely invited to be sold the public face of the New World Order for them to expound its virtues in their areas of influence. The Trilateral Commission (TC) Also known as the 'Child of Bilderberg', this group was founded by David Rockefeller in 1972-73 to covertly unify the policies of the US, Europe and Japan. Jimmy Carter's presidency was their first major coup with the president and many members of his administration being Trilateralists, including Zbigniew Brzezinski, his national security advisor and the first director of the Trilateral Commission. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" House of Rothschild | Rockefeller Empire | Dr Henry Kissinger part 2 THE MAIN PROTAGONISTS House of Rothschild The Rothschild empire was founded by Mayer Amschel Bauer (born 1743 in Frankfurt) with money embezzled from a German prince, William IX, who had in turn stolen the money from soldiers he was supplying to the British in the American War of Independence. Nathan, the son of Bauer (now Rothschild), set up the London branch and established the banking interest, N.M. Rothschild and Sons, which also had branches in Paris, Vienna, Berlin and Naples. Control passed through Nathan's son Lionel to Nathan Mayer Rothschild who became Governor of the Bank of England, was awarded a peerage in 1885 and was a member of the Round Table. At this time (1886-87) Randolph Churchill (Winston's father) was Chancellor of the Exchequer, funded by the Rothschilds and a close friend of Nathaniel Rothschild. Other notable family members include: Lord Victor Rothschild, the alleged '5th man' in the KGB spy ring, who was in charge of the 'Regulation 18b' prosecutions under Winston Churchill whereby a person could by arrested and imprisoned merely 'on suspicion'. He was head of Edward Heath's policy unit (1970-74) and allegedly head of an unnamed subversive organisation designed to manipulate the introduction of a Federal Europe. He was also once a governor of the BBC. l Baron Edmund de Rothschild was instrumental in the 'debt for equity' schemes whereby Third World countries gave up 'environmentally sensitive' land as a payment for debts. l Evelyn de Rothschild is the current chairman of N.M. Rothschild and is a member of the board of the Daily Telegraph , owned by the Hollinger Group. l Associated Companies/Families Since the late 1800s, business interests in America have been largely represented by Kuhn, Loeb and Co and controlling interests are often concealed by companies with 'City' or 'First City' in their names e.g. First City Financial Corporation of Vancouver, First City Development Ltd. The operation is largely co-ordinated through Rothschild Inc (New York) and PowerCorp, a Canadian company with strong links to the Hollinger Group. The Rothschilds are allegedly behind the Morgan Empire which derives from the London based George Peabody and Co which became J.S. Morgan and Co in 1864 on the death of Peabody (a Rothschild agent). Control passed to J.S. Morgan's son, John Pierpont Morgan, and the company acquired its present name of J.P. Morgan. The Morgan Empire now includes General Electric and all its subsidiaries, Morgan Guaranty Trust, National Bank of Commerce...etc.. The House of Rothschild also has strong connections with the Warburg banking family which includes Paul and Felix, who were instrumental in the setting up of the US Federal Reserve System, and their brother Max who ran the German interests."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Rockefeller Empire The Rockefeller Empire is based on oil, largely the Standard Oil company set up by John D. Rockefeller in 1853. (Part of this is now more familiar as Exxon and Esso.) Its influence on the political arena has been fairly open and obvious. J.D. Rockefeller III set up the Population Council in 1952 which, ever since, has been advocating zero population growth in the US. In 1972 this sentiment was echoed by Lawrence Rockefeller (CFR, Bil, TC) who was appointed by Nixon to lead a commission into population growth. When Ford became president as a result of Nixon's resignation in the aftermath of Watergate, Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller became vice-president (1974-77). A member of the CFR, he had formerly been part of the US delegation at the creation of the UN. A key family member is David Rockefeller who is head of the Chase Manhattan Bank, was chairman of the CFR (1946-53), is an omnipresent Bilderberger and creator of the Trilateral Commission. Percy Rockefeller is on the board of the Morgan Guaranty Trust and a member of the Skull and Bones Society. The Rockefellers donated money for the construction of the League of Nations headquarters in Geneva and donated the land in New York on which the UN headquarters are built. Associated Companies/Families The companies in which the Rockefellers have a controlling interest include Chase Manhattan Bank, Standard Oil (Esso/Exxon), National City Bank, Hannover National Bank, United States Trust Company, Equitable Life and Mutual of New York. Cousins of the Rockefellers are the Dulles brothers who were appointed to the US State Department during World War I, participated in the Treaty of Versailles meetings, became part of the RIIA/CFR network and had connections throughout US, English and German banking. John Foster Dulles, very much in favour of a 'super race' and a prominent supporter of Hitler, became Secretary of State at the same time as his brother Allen was head of the CIA. Dr Henry Kissinger A member of the Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, leading Bilderberger and head of Kissinger Associates (with Lord Carrington), Henry Kissinger is also connected with the RIIA, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the Rockefeller Foundation and is international advisor to the Hollinger Group. His public offices include being Head of the State Department and National Security Council under Nixon (1969). Kissinger was the leading international diplomat in the events that precipitated the Vietnam conflict and the Yom Kippur war between Egypt/Syria and Israel and yet was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973. He is also a member of the Alpine Freemasons Lodge in Switzerland and was (is?) possibly a leading figure in P2. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Steps towards a Global Bank part 3 ECONOMIC CONTROL Moves towards the New Word Order have been aided by the development of the current banking and economic system. As I have said before, it does not take a leap in imagination to realise that, at present, those who own the money in the world, control the world. And this is exactly how the Brotherhood has achieved its extensive influence. During the middle ages, when wealth was measured in riches, property and treasure – in gold especially – the Brotherhood, mainly in the guise of the Templars, managed to set themselves up as high level money lenders and repositories for wealth of the rich. Over time a system was devised whereby IOU tokens were supplied which represented the gold in store, instead of moving the cumbersome treasure itself. It was realised that vast sums could be made by the Brotherhood by lending out – in the form of paper representations of wealth – more than they actually had and charging interest on this wealth which did not exist. The returns were real wealth and gold as interest on worthless paper. Eventually, the world's gold reserves fell into the hands of the Brotherhood who initiated a now world recognised system of paper bartering which merely represented the wealth which lay in the vaults of these mega-wealthy few. Thus was created the system which rules the world today – known now as a respectable business it is the system called banking. Since Babylonian times usury – the lending of wealth at interest – has been one of the main causes of war and empire building. Nations such as Persia and Rome became great due to their massive debts incurred by lending money from wealthy nations. Later, unable to return the wealth, but rich and with great armies funded by this borrowed wealth, they soon realised a need to conquer these lending nations in order to nullify their debts. This was also the reason for the introduction of taxes, a global system which is in use right up to today. The charging of interest inflates the prices of goods as a large percentage of an item's cost is spent in servicing the debts of the suppliers/ manufacturers/distributors etc. The greater the debt, the higher the price. Banks use this high 'rate of inflation' to justify raising interest rates in order to discourage borrowing. This serves to create more debt on the existing loans and further reduce the amount of money in circulation. Economic depressions and booms are simply created by the banking institutions at will, by controlling the amount of money and credit in circulation. Banks extend their influence to every aspect of life by manipulating the stock markets to gain controlling interests in multinational companies. For example, a company seeking expansion is refused a loan by a bank. The value of the shares fall, the bank buys them before changing its mind and granting the loan. In order for a nation to prosper on a global economic basis it must borrow from private money lenders other people's money and money which does not exist in real terms, to pay for the implementation of its policies and then take real wealth back out of the nation's hands, plus interest, in order to pay back the debt. At the same time people are borrowing from the same banks to pay their taxes, their mortgages (other money lent at interest!) and to maintain the lifestyle they feel they deserve. This means that the banks can never lose. All wealth in circulation around the world, in effect, either belongs to them, is owed to them or will eventually be dragged into their vaults via the banking system. In 1993 the UK paid £24.5"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"billion in interest, more than twice that in the education budget! And yet, there is nothing to stop governments from printing their own money and lending it interest free. Abraham Lincoln did so – just before he was murdered by John Wilkes Booth (allegedly a Rothschild agent) and J.F. Kennedy had proposed to revive government printed money just before he too was removed in the same way. The Elite-controlled banking system is partly co-ordinated through the Bank of International Settlements in Switzerland and handled in individual countries by the national central banks which are either private banks (e.g. US Federal Reserve) or privately controlled banks under a facade of nationalisation. In England, the national bank was established in 1694 by the new King William of Orange, manoeuvred into place by the Orange Order which is directly controlled by the Black Nobility. It was a private venture under the House of Rothschild which has maintained its influence since nationalisation. The US Federal Reserve System was manipulated into place by the Elite bankers in 1910 through the efforts of Paul and Felix Warburg and Colonel House. The imposition of a Federal Income Tax required an amendment to the 16th constitution and therefore needed the agreement of 36 states. It was never actually ratified as only two states agreed but Congress was lied to and the bill was passed as 'law'. In 1985 the fact that all US Federal Tax collection has been illegal was acknowledged when a court granted a total refund to a businessman on this basis. As a letter from the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service to his regional directors says: '... every tax paid into the Treasury since 1913, is due and refundable to every citizen and business' . However, he advised that 'we will not publish or advertise this finding' and 'you are to destroy this memorandum'. Today we see the British government asset stripping in virtually every area of our society and promising great improvements in standards of living and health care whilst standards continue to fall and we wonder where all of the money is going to. The answer is simple, they are not selling the nation's assets to release money for the nation's good, they are taking it to pay the national debt. And why, in a world so rich in resources, are there people dying in their millions in second and third world countries through war and starvation? Again, it is because these private companies, the banks, would rather keep these nations in debt to the tune of billions of pounds than allow them the chance of developing their own societies to a healthy level. At present these nations need to borrow money to produce goods to sell to other nations in order to raise the money to pay back the banks at interest whilst their people starve and die. Many researchers have come to the conclusion with which I agree, that this is a deliberate policy of the Illuminati; to destroy the poorer nations through famine, disease and manipulated war in order to take total control of their lands which are often rich in mineral wealth. The penalty for not being able to pay debts is the loss of property and land, whether through an inability to pay one's mortgage or an inability to pay one's national debt. In reality, very few people are almost entirely responsible for the vast majority of negativity and suffering in the world. It is an ingenious system which has us all at its mercy. The great god 'Banking', together with its spin off deities of 'Economic Growth' and 'Gross Domestic Product', has seen to it that the majority of the world's nations are drowning in an ocean of debt whilst the minority elite are floating on staggering amounts of wealth. It makes little secret of its origins either: the symbol of the Illuminati for the Brotherhood, the 'All Seeing Eye' which sits inside a triangle/pyramid, is the symbol which adorns the U.S dollar bill. Whilst the world is controlled by the economics of banks and whilst survival depends upon lending money at interest, there will always be rulers and the ruled and a need for war. This is because there will always be vastly more money in circulation than there is actual wealth to back it up; and when the borrowers run"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"out of money to pay their lenders they have merely two choices: to become enslaved to their debtors or to conquer them. It is for this reason that the bankers must maintain their position of ownership over the military, law, oil, pharmaceuticals, media and education etc.. In order to maintain this position of absolute power, the world's borrowers must be kept in ignorance of the truth of the situation which is that they are little more than slaves to their lenders. True history, which is the story of billions of individuals, including their manipulation, must not be taught. Indeed, it most certainly is not. The history books are full of kings and queens, 'goodies' and 'badies', wars and conquered nations, when they should more accurately be described as the chronicles of greed and wealth. For the System to survive it must also suppress true science, true history and the full exploration of spirituality. Steps towards a Global Bank The World Bank This lends money to finance projects in the Third World to meet the needs of the multinationals. By financing projects which are totally irrelevant to the needs of the local people; the local economy is destroyed and rainforests are decimated. This conveniently adds to the environmental 'problem' (see later). Bill Clinton nominated the current president of the World Bank – James Wolfensohn from the Schroder Bank, Population Council, Bilderberg Steering Committee, CFR and business partner of the Rothschilds. International Monetary Fund (IMF) When poor countries get into Elite-engineered financial trouble, the IMF intervenes to offer more loans (thereby increasing the debt) on the condition that the Elite's policies are followed e.g. giving up land, which should be used to grow crops to feed the country's population, to produce luxury cash crops instead, which are exported at cut down prices to the multinationals. Free Trade Agreements such as GATT, NAFTA and APEC are promoted as 'good' things, showing close co-operation between the peoples of the world. In fact, 'free' trade serves to make all countries reliant on global consumerism dominated by the multinationals. With no tariff on imported goods there is no financial protection for home production, so Third World countries become dependent on imported goods. Land and people in the developing world are therefore open to exploitation by global companies, and industries in the developed countries can be undermined at will. European Monetary Union The most obvious stepping stone to a global bank and currency is the move by the European Union towards a centralised bank and single currency. Despite the apparent debate, this has already been decided upon with the UK's supposed opt-out clause in the Maastricht Treaty being over-ruled by another. Also in the Maastricht Treaty are details of the control of the European currency and the reserves of each member state by six members of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank who, through their eight years of guaranteed security of tenure, 'may not seek or take instructions from Community institutions...or any other body'. Control of Food One of the more unbelievable examples of corporate exploitation of particularly the Third World is the systematic destruction of natural agricultural seeds, replacing them with patented genetically engineered ones. According to UN estimates, 75% of genetic diversity in agricultural crops has been lost this century and in England, 1500 'unapproved' seed varieties have been withdrawn. The situation now is that, instead of using native seed varieties, Third World countries must pay"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"royalties to the multinational companies for genetically engineered seeds, which have been distributed and chemically produced by the same corporations, and which are useless in a Third World environment. As a result the same people control the actual food that we can eat – 90% of all food trade is in the hands of five multinationals: 50% are controlled by Unilever (who's chairman, Paul Rykens was at the heart of the formation of the Bilderberg Group) and Nestlé alone.

This manifests in many ways on different scales, e.g. the Cold War between Eastern communism and Western capitalism; managed conflicts in the oil rich Middle East (aided by the creation of Israel after World War I); the illusion of choice in apparent democracies. To achieve this, the same organisations finance and covertly encourage sides that are portrayed as being opposites. Wars are used to abruptly change political systems, so are seldom fought for the simplistic 'good versus evil' reasons declared publicly. Instead, they are deliberately engineered to further the progress to the New World Order. After all, as decided by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (one of the tax-exempt foundations established by the Carnegie, Rockefeller and Ford families) wars are the 'most effective way to alter the lives of an entire people'. They also make vast amounts of money for the armaments companies and the banks who lend money to governments. Such control has been going on for centuries through the Knights Templars who could 'make kings', the manoeuvring of particular Royal Houses into power throughout Europe in the 15th-17th centuries, the French Revolution, the American War of Independence etc.. In this century the manipulation is demonstrable but, because it is clandestine and apparently contradictory, the situation is very complex. However, a brief look at the events from the First World War onwards reveals the true motivation behind major events and the organisations/people behind them. Behind the First World War/Russian Revolution In 1914 the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand, who had received death threats from Freemasons, was killed (at the second attempt) by a Serbian secret society. This was used as an excuse for Austria, backed by Germany, to declare war on Serbia, backed by Russia and France. Rasputin (the peasant mystic who gained favour and thereby actual political power in the house of Nicolas II because of his apparent ability to heal the crown prince Alexis' haemophilia), who effectively ran the administration in Russia, could have averted the war but was temporarily removed by an assassination attempt which occurred at almost exactly the same time as the murder in Serbia. In Germany, Kaiser Wilhelm's Chancellor was Bethman-Hollweg, a cousin of the Rothschilds and his personal banker was Max Warburg. The German newsagency, Wolff, was owned by the Rothschilds who also had a controlling interest in Havas and Reuters, the French and British newsagencies. Britain entered the war against Germany and America did likewise in 1917, as was always planned; the ostensible reason of the sinking of the (arms carrying) Lusitania (which knowingly sailed into German patrolled waters) was merely a publicity stunt to 'outrage' the American people and so give them the impression that they had entered the war through choice. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace which, despite its name, had manipulated America into the war, consequently telegraphed the US President Woodrow Wilson requesting that he 'see that the war did not end too quickly'. To remove Russia from the war, Germany openly supported the Russian Revolution by funding Bolshevik"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"propaganda and safeguarding Lenin's passage through Germany. However, it was also co-ordinated by the Rockefellers and Rothschilds (via Kuhn, Loeb and Co) who funded both Trotsky and the anti-Bolshevik reaction in America. Trotsky himself was most probably a German who left the US in 1917 on a passport arranged by President Wilson. Final details were arranged in a 24 man Red Cross mission to Russia in 1917 – a 'medical' mission in which only seven were doctors, the others being leading financiers including William Boyce Thompson, head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. With the Bolsheviks successfully installed, media opposition in Britain and America was suppressed and agents dispatched to control diplomatic and intelligence reports. After the war, the treaty negotiations were held at Versailles, hosted by Baron Edmund de Rothschild. Accompanying Lloyd George was Alfred Milner and the US delegation with Wilson included Colonel House, Max and Paul Warburg, the Dulles brothers and Thomas Lamont of J.P. Morgan. The Treaty of Versailles served three main purposes: it spawned the League of Nations which was the first attempt at world government drafted by House with its Genevan headquarters built with Rockefeller money; it confirmed the State of Israel creating instability in the Middle East; and it created the financial situation to lead inevitably to a second war through which the New World Order could consolidate its position. This was achieved through setting German reparations at a level to cripple the new German republic and by returning all economies to a gold standard which affected all the European countries who were already in serious debt to the American banks, especially to J.P. Morgan. The Second World War Through the 1920s and '30s, loans from Wall Street financed German rearmament and the rise of Hitler. One German company which benefited substantially from these loans was I.G. Farben which by 1939 had become the biggest chemical manufacturer in the world, and enabled Germany to become self-sufficient in rubber, petrol, oil and explosives. (This company used the inmates of Auschwitz as slave labour at their massive chemical plant during the war and are estimated to have worked at least 25,000 inmates to death; others were killed in their drug testing program. In the Nuremberg Trials after the war twelve of I.G. Farben/Germany's top executives were sentenced to minor terms of imprisonment for slavery and mistreatment offences whilst many others were acquitted. None of the Americans who also sat on the same board as the convicted were ever tried as a war criminal). On the supervising board of I.G. Farben was Max Warburg and on the board of American I.G. Farben were US and German bankers, friends of Roosevelt and members of Nazi intelligence. Rockefeller's Standard Oil assisted I.G. Farben's programme of research into making oil from coal (which Germany had a plentiful supply of). I.G. Farben were Hitler's major financial backers along with US money channelled through the German subsidiaries of General Electric Company (GEC), International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT) and Ford. Having supplied the loans to rearm Germany, repayment was demanded in cash causing the German economy to crash, ensuring Hitler could seize power with popular support of his economic solution. In the same year, 1933, Franklin Roosevelt took the American Presidency in a remarkably similar situation, offering a 'New Deal' type solution in the wake of serious economic depression. Both Hitler and Roosevelt were advised by people connected with the American-German cartels and the Bank of International Settlements. Meanwhile, Britain had adopted a policy of appeasing Germany. This was promoted by the PM Neville Chamberlain as advised by Round Table members such as Lord Halifax, Lord Lothian, Leopold Amery and the Astors (who owned The Times). In order to be self-sufficient through a lengthy war, Hitler's Germany needed the resources of Czechoslovakia, so the British government continued promoting appeasement until Austria and then Czechoslovakia were taken in 1939. The Bank of England then relinquished the £6 million of Czech gold deposited in London to the conquering Nazis. The erstwhile appeasers (Milner, Lothian, Astor and Amery) turned on Chamberlain and on the ensuing wave of pro-war opinion Churchill swept to power. There is evidence to suggest that before Churchill became Prime"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Minister coded messages passed between him and Roosevelt which confirm that the war was a premeditated set-up. On taking office Churchill immediately appointed Victor Rothschild to implement 'Regulation 18b' to imprison, without trial, anyone suspected of opposing the war. Thus, the protagonists were in place – Roosevelt, otherwise known as the Knight of Pythias, a 33rd degree mason and member of the Ancient Arabic Order of Nobles of the Mystic Shrine; Churchill, a freemason who had several meetings with the esoteric guru Aleister Crowley; and Hitler who, with Himmler, Goering and Hess, were steeped in the esoteric traditions of groups such as the Thule Society, the Vril Society and the Edelweiss Society, all of which preached anti-Semitism and a Master Race. Occult symbolism and ritual pervaded Nazi Germany from the swastika to the Nuremberg rallies and the organisation of the SS. World War II was fought to the game plan laid down by the Elite. Despite Roosevelt's assurances to the contrary, American entry into the war was a foregone conclusion and was engineered by the Council on Foreign Relations who advised that the US adopt an anti-Japanese stance in the China-Japanese war, including a trade embargo and refusal of entry into the Panama Canal. Roosevelt knew Pearl Harbour was to be bombed from eight independent intelligence sources and 'fortunately' the cream of the US navy was not in the harbour on the day of the bombing. The invasion of Britain by Germany was not part of the plan so, despite having the ideal opportunity after Dunkirk, Hitler did not cross the channel. However, the Elite's script required the creation of an apparent east/west divide, so as the Allies swept victoriously into Germany, they allowed the Soviet Union to extend to and divide Berlin. During the war, the American-German cartels made fantastic amounts of money. Their German factories were left amazingly unscathed amidst the bomb devastation, and after the war the same people were appointed by Roosevelt to supervise the fate of German industry. These decided that German industry could only continue if the German people accepted full responsibility for Nazism, thus diverting public scrutiny away from the truth. At the farcical Nuremberg Trials only insignificant German directors of the cartels were tried and few found guilty. Elsewhere at the trials defendants were barbarically tortured and, due to a change made by a professor at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in April 1944, 'following orders' was not an admissible defence. The major Nazi leaders were probably smuggled out of Germany to South America and the scientists responsible for their advanced rocket and mind-control technology were re-situated in prestigious posts in major colleges, universities and NASA in the US. This relocation and infiltration spanned forty years and was known as Operation Paperclip. These scientists are still in positions of influence and are involved in covert high-tech mind-control experiments for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) which are under National Security Agency (NSA) known as Operation MK-Ultra (see Who We Are – Mind Manipulation). The outcome of this was just as planned by the Elite with the public crying out for any means to prevent future wars. Many of the solutions offered by politicians have been moves towards global government and the centralisation of power. The United Nations This was created to solve future disputes by words, not war, but was in fact one of the main reasons that the Second World War was fashioned. The UN had been created by the Council on Foreign Relations as early as 1941, four years before its official foundation by representatives of more than 50 countries. The US delegation to the founding meeting in San Francisco, June 1945, included 74 members of the CFR. The majority of people working for the UN are genuinely seeking to bring peace to the world. However, it is one of the main vehicles for world government and world army and all six UN Secretary Generals have promoted New World Order type attitudes."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"More and more areas of our lives are being globalised through UN organisations under different excuses for international jurisdiction—the World Health Organisation, UN Population Fund, UN Environment Programme, UNESCO (for education, science and culture). European Union The three trading blocks of Europe, the Americas and Asia-Australasia are the stepping stones through which government is being centralised before global control. NAFTA (North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement), which has recently been extended, and APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation) look set to follow the example of Europe which is developing from a trade co-operative to a United States of Europe. The European Economic Community (EEC) was largely the brain-child of Jean Monnet and Joseph Retinger (a founder of the Bilderberg group). It was funded by loans devised by Monnet and the CFR and was formally created in 1957 by the Treaty of Rome, drafted by Monnet and the CFR. If any country showed a reluctance to join, the US pro-Europe position was made very clear to the 'offending' country. The EEC has since become the European Community and now the European Union. Monetary union has been confirmed by the Maastricht treaty and the situation moves ever closer to a Federal Europe. In 1980, the EC drew up a map of regions within a proposed Federal Europe. England did not feature as an administrative unit and the regions defined in the former Yugoslavia are those which have since been created by the recent war. The public have always been kept in the dark about the extent of the union, with Prime Ministers Heath, Wilson and Callaghan all accepting the renunciation of sovereignty and incorporation into a Federal Europe. Margaret Thatcher served her economic purpose with Reagan in the 1980s but her resistance to European Union ensured her downfall in 1990. Her demise was decided upon by the 1989 meeting of the Bilderberg group. In the June 1995, Bilderberg meeting, attended by Norman Lamont and William Waldegrave, John Major was threatened with a similar fate if he didn't back a Federal Europe. The leadership challenge by John Redwood, supported by Lamont, was based on their alleged opposition to Federalisation. Major conveniently won and purged his Cabinet of anti-federalists. The Illusion of Democracy Centralisation of power would not be accepted by the public if it was imposed directly; but by offering an apparent choice in the democratic elections of Britain and the US, people are sold the illusion that actions of politicians are accountable to the majority. In America, presidencies are won through money, so those who control the financial resources dictate who becomes president and the president is then under obligation to those who funded him. The apparent differences between Republicans and Democrats are a façade as epitomised by George Bush, the Republican President 1989-1993, and Bill Clinton, the current Democratic President. Both are members of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission; both are 33rd degree masons; both support GATT, NAFTA, centralisation and economic growth at the expense of humanity and the environment; and both are heavily involved in drug trafficking, child abuse, murder and the Iran-Contra affair. In the British 'democracy' a person's allegiance to a political party is largely dictated by income and image. The majority of constituencies are 'safe seats' because due to the affluence, or otherwise, of an area the people automatically vote Conservative or Labour, respectively. Any candidate who toes the Elite line can be easily installed in parliament through these seats and subsequently MPs are instructed how to vote by their party. Those who attempt to be individuals and not support their party on certain issues face"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"sanctions, whereas those who are willing to do as they are told advance rapidly. MPs are bribed to ask questions on behalf of certain companies, they often have external directorships and consultancies and on leaving government they often move into top commercial posts. For example, Lord Wakeham, who was instrumental in the privatisation of the electrical industry, became a director of N.M. Rothschild who had made a fortune from the privatisation. Other directors of N.M. Rothschild include Norman Lamont (former Chancellor), Lord Armstrong (one of Thatcher's cabinet secretaries during privatisation), Clive Whitmore (Home Office permanent secretary) and Frank Cooper (Ministry of Defence permanent secretary). As early as 1940 Harold Wilson was preaching a centralised Federal Europe and outlined a plan of infiltration of the Labour and Conservative parties to form a centre party of moderates which could brand any genuine opposition as extremists. The plan also included the destruction of the British manufacturing industries. Between 1964 and 1975, Wilson (Labour) was Prime Minister, except when he was replaced in 1970-74 by his Bilderberg colleague Edward Heath (Conservative). The two of them ran down British industry, limited MI5 investigational powers and moved towards European Union. Wilson was aided by Lord Victor Rothschild as the head of his Central Policy Review Staff, and his Chancellor Denis Healey (Bilderberger, TC, RIIA). Today, all political parties agree on the major issues—Major, Blair and Ashdown are all in favour of European Union, a single currency and bank, Maastricht, GATT and Western consumerism.

Meanwhile, NATO is expanding to absorb more countries of the Eastern bloc and operate outside its designated areas. Eventually these will fuse to form a world army to enforce the New World Order. The Gulf War was a major step along the path, as it was fought with NATO funding under a UN banner. Just prior to the conflict, closer co-operation was called between the countries of the former Soviet Union and NATO in order to extend the alliance beyond the North Atlantic and Europe The Gulf War Iraq, in an attempt to recover from the expensive eight year war with Iran, had been seeking to control its own oil reserves – independence which the Western oil companies could not allow. So, as well as being of importance to the Elite's long term goals of a world army, the conflict was engineered to effectively destroy Iraq both economically and in terms of its population. Saddam Hussein had been installed in 1968 on the back of CIA support for his Baath party. In November 1989, US loans to Iraq were guaranteed providing that the money was used to buy US farm produce. Instead, as expected, Hussein used the money for arms and defaulted on the loans. The US taxpayer is now picking up the bill for rearming the 'enemy'. This US funding was done through the Atlantan branch of the Italian government bank, Banco Nazionale del Lavaro (BNL), which loaned $5 billion. Loans from the BNL to Iraq for arms purchases were organised as early as 1984 by Kissinger Associates. Some of the Iraqi arms were bought from Britain in illegal sales which implicate the British government. This possibly includes the Midland Industrial Trade Services, allegedly the secret arms running wing of the Midland Bank, which was introduced to the Iraqis by Kissinger Associates. Having armed Iraq, America needed an excuse to invade. This opportunity came through covertly supporting Kuwait's obstinate insistence to make economic recovery difficult for Iraq by over-producing oil and keeping prices low. In July 1990, whilst assuring Hussein that his administration had no interest in an 'Arab-Arab conflict, like your border disagreement with Kuwait', Bush reached agreement with Gorbachev that Russia would not intervene if America invaded Iraq. Kuwait was invaded by Iraq in August 1990 and Bush started talking about economic sanctions against Iraq. Saudi Arabia was convinced by the Americans that it was under threat and under this pretext US forces were dispatched to protect Saudi Arabia. These were later joined by British and French troops to create a UN army. One month before the UN invasion of Kuwait/Iraq, a US army report detailed the destruction of Kuwait, the firing of the oil wells and which companies would be involved in the lucrative rebuilding of Kuwait and extinguishing the fires. In the ensuing bombing, Iraqui industry, and therefore its post-conflict economy, was destroyed and hundreds of thousands of people have died, either as a direct result of indiscriminate bombing or in the ensuing poverty and deprivation. Through the Gulf conflict, the phrase 'New World Order', used by Bush in a victory speech, was used by all and sundry to describe this unprecedented global military co-operation. Public approval for this type of"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"intervention has been amplified by the manipulation of Yugoslavia to show inadequacies in the current UN Peacekeeping force, as first highlighted by their ineffectiveness in Rwanda and Somalia. As none of these trouble spots adversely effect the oil trade, an operation on the scale of the Gulf War is not required. Incidentally, there is already a joint UN/NATO Allied Rapid Reaction Corps whose existence was justified by the failure of the UN in Yugoslavia. The Supposed ET Menace The need for a world army is also being sold to the public as a defence against UFOs, for planetary security against aggressive extra-terrestrials. This has been achieved through a massive cover up of genuine ET contact and UFO sightings. ETs of both positive and negative intent for humanity are visiting this planet – they have been for millennia – and have possibly established underground bases on Earth. By working with these ETs, Elite science is far more advanced than conventional science would have us believe. Free energy, anti-gravity technology, advanced mass mind manipulation techniques are all under the control of the military in highly secretive and sinister underground centres like Area S-4 in Nevada, the Dulce facility in New Mexico, RAF Rudloe Manor (Wiltshire) and Mount Weather near Washington DC. The 'non-existence' of such technology enables the issue of UFO/ET interaction to be plagued with disinformation. The propaganda machine ridicules true sightings, while high publicity awaits encounters where people are subjected to terrifying experiments at the hands of ETs. However it is very probable that such incidents are in fact carried out by the military and intelligence services using technology the general public are unaware of in order to create the desired response of fear and the demand for global defence. However, I believe that a proportion of abductions are occurring to individuals who have agreed – perhaps before incarnation – to being involved in such ET experiments which are monitoring the human race in such areas as pollution effects on the body and genetic evolution etc.. Abductee reports include a programme of implantation and removal of foetuses for the purpose of cross-breeding humans and aliens. One further sinister twist to the tale of ETs is that certain people who have been victims of Satanic and paedophilic abuse have, as part of the process of regaining suppressed memories, uncovered images of ETs over-laid on the memories of abuse by people. Mind control is a central part of the process of Satanic abuse whereby the brain is compartmentalised through severe trauma, assisted by drugs and Electro-Convulsive-Treatment. In this way it is possible to bury memories of events a long way behind implanted ones. This is the same technique used by the intelligence agencies to create perfect lone assassins. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" Eugenics | Engineered Wars part 6 POPULATION CONTROL Eugenics One of the most alarming of the Elite's doctrines is that of eugenics – controlling human reproduction in order to reduce the number of those that the Elite perceive as inferior to create a 'master race' with 'desirable' genetic characteristics. Eugenics had its highest public profile in Nazi Germany but the policies began a long time before Hitler and are continuing to the present day. The philosophy was pioneered by Thomas Malthus in the 18th/19th centuries who sought to encourage disease and child mortality in the poor. So-called Malthusianism has since been adopted by different organisations for a variety of excuses. After various eugenics policies in the US states in the late 19th century, including the compulsory sterilisation of the mentally ill and 'undesirables' in Indiana, the Rockefellers established a eugenics research centre in New York. They were supported in this venture by the Harrimans, another family of manipulators. The First International Congress of Eugenics was held in London in 1912 and was attended by a certain Winston Churchill. By 1917, fifteen US states had eugenics laws to sterilise epileptics, the mentally ill and regular criminals. On the agenda of the Third International Congress in 1932 was the 'problem' of African-Americans which, according to the delegates, revealed a need to sterilise to 'cut off bad stock'. At this meeting were several Nazis, including Dr Ernst Rudin, who had been enabled to attend by the Hamburg-Amerika Shipping Line, owned by the Harriman and Bush families. On returning to Germany, Rudin, who was funded by the Rockefellers, supervised the policy of sterilising those who were retarded, deaf, blind or alcoholics. Between 1941 and 1943, at the same time as the 'master race' mentality in Hitler's Germany was being condemned by the rest of the world, 42,000 people were sterilised in the US. Five years later the Sterilisation League/ Birthright Inc. established a eugenics centre in North Carolina which began a project to forcibly sterilise young children who were considered to have a low IQ. This was part funded by the Gray family, close friends of the Bush's. After the war, John D. Rockefeller III and John Foster Dulles campaigned against the extension of the non-white populations and in 1952 launched the Population Council. This still exits and is still advocating zero population growth in the US, family planning in the developing sector and the expansion of the Club of Rome's 'Malthusianism'. (See later for details of the Club of Rome.) Eugenics policies are funded by the World Bank which, at the Rio summit, pledged to double the money available to population control. Birth control is now forced on the developing countries through fear of economic sanctions. The extent of the population control towards which the Elite are striving was revealed in the 1962/63 'Report from Iron Mountain' , a secret study group into controlling population without war. It sought completely artificial procreation to supersede the 'ecological function of war'. This was to include total control of contraception via water supplies and essential food stuffs so babies could only be conceived by those to whom a carefully controlled antidote had been administered. Such a system was apparently"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"already under development... 35 years ago! George Bush is a major voice in the eugenics movement and is surrounded by like-minded people – Boyden Gray (his legal advisor) and William Draper III (head of fundraising for his 1980 presidential campaign). Draper's grandfather had unsuccessfully urged eugenics policies on Eisenhower before convincing Johnson to adopt them. In 1969 Bush was involved in hearings into the 'dangers of too many black babies' and when he became ambassador to the UN in 1972 he arranged for the Association of Voluntary Surgical Contraception (formerly the Sterilisation League) to extend its policy of sterilising young children with 'low' IQ to non-white countries. This was further extended when Bush became president in 1988. Engineered Wars War is one of the most effective ways of culling an 'undesirable' population as Thomas Ferguson, a member of the Office of Population Affairs, explains: 'to reduce the population quickly you have to pull all the males into the fighting and kill significant numbers of fertile, child-bearing age, females.' From his position of 'shuttle' diplomat, Henry Kissinger has successfully engineered conflict throughout the world. In Vietnam, the war was caused by the movement of hundreds of thousands of people from the north to the south – a move forced on them by the Saigon Military Mission, created by the CIA in 1954. With no food, they resorted to theft, and by labelling the bands 'the Viet Cong' a problem was created. Under the pretext that they were controlled by the Khmer Rouge, the north Vietnamese were severely bombed. According to estimates, 30-500,000 Cambodians died in the bombings, when in fact China was the power behind North Vietnam, supported by Kissinger with US/China liaisons headed by George Bush. The Khmer Rouge reacted, as expected, and took Cambodia, murdering 32% of the population. During the war, the CIA station in Saigon co-ordinated Operation Phoenix which reportedly murdered 40,000 Vietnamese on 'suspicion' of working for the Viet Cong – that is, they could read and write . Two of the US commanders in the conflict were Maxwell Taylor and William Westmoreland, both members of the Population Crisis Council and Draper Fund. The Yom Kippur war and countless other 'civil wars' in Central America and Africa have been engineered by Kissinger to cull populations as even when it is not the prime aim; mass killings are perceived as a useful by-product of war. Kissinger is a member of the Club of Rome and in 1974 supervised the production of National Security Study Memo 200 about the implications of population growth. This stated that population growth in the developing world would lead to a desire for self determination of their economies. It continued that the population must therefore be controlled, but this fact must be withheld from the country's leaders. Amongst the countries specifically targeted were Ethiopia, Columbia, India, Nigeria, Mexico and Indonesia. Indonesia is an horrendous example of conflict creation for the purposes of eugenics and corporate control, while public bodies and the media remain obstinately silent. General Suharto took control of Indonesia in 1965 through a CIA-backed coup and has since been responsible for 500,000 murders in his own country. However, because his administration is subservient to Western corporations, allowing them to exploit the land and the people (e.g. Reebok), this appalling tragedy goes unchallenged in the media. In December 1975 Indonesia invaded the Portuguese colony of East Timor and, in the following years, proceeded to slaughter 200,000 people, a third of the Timorese population. This genocide (eugenics) has been carried out with arms from Britain (British Aerospace's Hawk Jets) and US, approval from the West (Kissinger and Ford were in Indonesia days before the invasion) and complete silence in the mass media.

People who consider themselves 'free' through the pursuit of their own dogmatic religion are amongst the most enslaved victims of the Illuminati's plan for total take over of mind, body and soul. Fear, guilt and a host of other negative emotions have been instilled into humanity in the name of religion – the Christian guilt due to the doctrine of 'original sin' and fear of the final judgement; Jewish feelings of divine punishment for failing Yahweh; Islamic aggression to convert the masses by the sword; the Hindu caste system in which 'untouchables' have no hope of salvation in this lifetime. Western Catholicism, with its control over all education for centuries and its intolerance of alternatives (usually condemned as heresies with the proponents ex-communicated, exiled or barbarically tortured and killed) successfully kept the masses in cringing subservience to their vengeful, yet supposedly loving, God. The Catholic Church, in turn, has been controlled and bled dry of wealth by an especially sinister organisation which is a combination of elements of Freemasonry and the Mafia, known as P2. Religions are also answerable to the banks. When scientific developments in the 18th and 19th centuries started disputing the orthodox theological interpretation of 'who we are', people's belief in the church started to wane and they threatened to start thinking for themselves. The Elite consequently hijacked this new science in order to switch the general belief from a judgmental God (which enabled control through fear etc.) to a denial of the existence of God and a belief that this life is all that there is (which enabled control through science and materialism). Darwin's theories on evolution was the first major coup on the mass mindset for the 'survival of the fittest/no God' belief system which has been prevalent in the last century. This theory, which did not originate with Charles Darwin, was essentially the work of the Lunar Society, a revolutionary organisation created to undermine God and overthrow monarchies, which Darwin's family was very involved in. By the end of his life Darwin himself did not believe the argument but the theories had taken hold and have since been taught as scientific fact. Once more our ideas about who and what we are have been programmed into us – beliefs which serve the Elite and their goal of complete control. Ideas which challenge the now orthodox belief in evolution or seek to publicise the eternal nature of the spirit are marginalised into groups which are subsequently labelled as 'cults' – a word which is instinctively interpreted as 'a dangerous group of slightly insane people'. The stigma has been deliberately attached to the word for this very reason by highly publicised cults and the behaviour attributed to them. For example, the Jonestown massacre in 1978, which research has shown was probably a CIA mind-control experiment, and the Waco 'mass suicide' by burning alive in 1993 when followers of David Koresh were attacked by the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) with tanks armed with flame throwers. Coincidentally, the BATF had contacted a local hospital before the raid to enquire about the availability of beds in the burns unit. Cults which promote a world government and whose belief system incorporates the New World Order are"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"supported by the Elite, e.g. the Moonies, the Church of Scientology and certain strands of the New Age movement. The 'opposite' side is also funded by the same people – the reactionary 'cult buster' groups, like the Cult Awareness Network set up by Dr West, a CIA asset which is heavily involved in Nazi-style mind control experiments. Education Conventionally taught and accepted history and science have a fundamental influence on the way that we perceive the world. Therefore, the control of education and the way that these subjects are presented has been of paramount importance to the Elite. This has been one of the main occupations of the Round Table, and in America the task was given to the Rockefeller Foundation by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace to prevent American life from returning to its pre-World War I state. The lessons taught in the schools of today are those of confusion (there is no meaning), hierarchical position (envy those above, despise those below), dependency ('success' is measured by the opinion of others and only 'experts' know the truth), obedience (do as others instruct in order to progress) and above all, conformity. A child is simply there to be filled with System-accepted 'facts', regimentally hurried from one lesson to the next to be bombarded with apparently unrelated information with any genuine enthusiasm or interest stifled in the boredom of classroom conformity. A child's intelligence is then measured by his or her meek receptivity to the systematic brainwashing and his or her ability to regurgitate these 'facts' in examinations, whilst the teacher's performance is evaluated by the speed and completeness of the indoctrination. The curriculum is very carefully controlled with standardised textbooks which teachers, whatever their personal feelings on the subject, have to teach in order to retain their jobs. Real questions about the nature of life, the reasons behind the contradictions in accepted historical absurdities, the dreams of self-expression have no part in the strait jacket of System education. People are 'consumers' and cogs in the corporate machine, and those who can accept this role are what the education process call 'successful'. If conformity is the price of 'success', those who seek alternative views and reject the indoctrination are made to experience shame and a sense of failure. We are taught that the Elite system of corporate-led consumerism has been freely created and that it provides the only answer for a meaningful, worthwhile life. Childhood happiness, enthusiasm and excitement for life are suffocated as we are taught to operate within a system which denies the very essences of humanity – love and the ability to question and search for the truth of our current existence. The Media Information about and interpretation of current affairs is gained exclusively through the media – newspapers, t.v. and radio. Newspapers are presented as being independent or having a known political leaning and t.v. is supposedly unbiased and independent. This is simply not the case. Information about events come from 'official sources' who can present the view that the Elite want the public to accept. Alternatively, news stories are derived from central news agencies (e.g. Reuters) who give everybody the same story. Newcomers to a media company are expected to toe the conventional line or suddenly their prospects become bleak. Journalists who analyse and think independently are dangerous and are few and far between. This is not to suggest that every single journalist from the boardroom down to the 'hack' is involved in some massive conspiracy and cover up. Once the framework has been set up (which it deliberately has been over the last few centuries) the system is self-regulatory simply through 'market forces'. Running a newspaper or television station is an expensive business which instantly limits those organisations which can operate one. Such businesses are obviously financially successful in the System, so have an interest in maintaining the status quo. Opinions and stories which challenge the establishment are therefore of no interest to these companies and are viewed as subversive. The media industry is also advertising-based"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"with prices of newspapers kept below the manufacturing costs by advertising income. Multinationals will not support those newspapers/magazines which are viewed as 'anti-business' so such publications are marginalised out of existence simply by market forces. Advertiser-friendly media companies keep their readership in a suitable 'buying' frame of mind by not being controversial, not presenting 'difficult' articles or programmes. The threat of withdrawal of advertising is generally sufficient to ensure the media companies vigilantly filter the stories they present but if one slips through, business organisations often combine forces to pressurise editors into reviewing their content. This is done through letters, law-suits and even parliamentary bills. An example of these so-called 'flak machines' is Accuracy in Media (AIM) a collection of corporate giants, including eight oil companies, whose function is to maintain a corporate-friendly media in the US. A look at the board members of media companies is revealing about their alleged independence. In America a large number of the directors of NBC, CBS and ABC all have common involvement with Rothschild/Rockefeller/Morgan companies, as well as being members of the Council on Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission. In Britain, the Daily Telegraph is owned by the Hollinger group who advisors/directors include Henry Kissinger, Lord Carrington, Brzezinski and Lord Rothschild. The current chairman of N.M. Rothschild, Evelyn de Rothschild, is on the board of the Daily Telegraph . A former board member, Andrew Knight (Bil), is now executive chairman of the 'rival' News International , which runs The Times and the Sun , and which is funded by the Oppenheimers and the Rothschilds. Regulatory bodies such as the Press Complaints Commission also have links with the same people e.g. the chairman Lord Wakeham who is a director of N.M. Rothschild. Most people form their opinions on the basis of newspapers whose political stance mirrors their own. As all media organisations are owned by companies with the same interests and have their content dictated by the advertisers and obtain their stories from the same sources, all 'sides' of public opinion are easily manipulated. This is used to divert attention away from the true agenda: Investigators getting near to the truth are branded as anti-Semitic so attention is focused away from their information onto their apparent racism. l 'Expose' books, such as Peter Wright's Spycatcher are publicly opposed by those in government to give credence to their revelations. Their 'exposure' of what are generally innocent people are then believed more readily. l Sensitive information is released when overshadowed by another news story, e.g. identity cards were announced by Michael Howard on the day of the Loyalist cease-fire in Northern Ireland. l Libya has been blamed for the Lockerbie bombing (among other things) to undermine Colonel Gaddafi, when all the evidence points to the CIA and other intelligence agencies. The Libyan leader is, in fact, one of the 'evil tyrants' the media so love to create as a simplistic 'bad guy' at which the public can direct their animosity. He is not exactly a saint but, in the 1980s, Gaddafi was responsible for 14 deaths (mostly Libyans), as compared with the 50,000 corpses at the feet of the regime in El Salvador – an administration installed by the US with a US trained army. l Assassinations are blamed on a lone person with no affiliation to any group. The murder of J.F. Kennedy, for example, was ascribed to Lee Harvey Oswald (who was subsequently murdered himself by a 'lone assassin') but investigations have shown that it could not have been Oswald but it is much more likely that the American President was removed by the intelligence agencies because he did not follow the Elite game plan and was threatening to expose it by 'smashing the CIA into a thousand pieces'. l 'Choice' Public opinion is sold the illusion of choice by maintaining groups in apparent opposition to each other. Again, the majority will believe that they are involved in a real battle for what they genuinely believe to be"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"correct, when in reality the funding and support is derived from the same sources as their opposition. As long as New World Order policies are being promoted it makes no difference to the Elite whether a group is Jewish, anti-Jewish, Left wing, Right wing, Christian, Moslem etc.... it will be used while it serves their purpose. Another vital tool is instilling a belief that the goals the Elite are striving towards are good and necessary things. This is often achieved by creating a 'problem', which the public react against and call for an official response. The 'solution' which is offered and which is accepted on a wave of public support is the very thing the Elite wanted in the first place. There are countless examples of these but I shall cite just three: The 'problem' of violent crime has elicited a wave of public feeling in favour of increased police powers. l 'New age' travellers were suddenly severely harassed by the police and received considerable media attention. When they reacted against their treatment an apparent 'problem' had been created which was met with the 'solution' of the Criminal Justice Bill. This restriction on personal freedom sailed through parliament and the media spotlight was focused away from the travellers to firstly give the impression of 'problem solved' and secondly, they had served their purpose. l The Oklahoma Bomb in April 1995 in which 168 men, women and children were killed was reported as being caused by a fertiliser bomb – despite the absence of any fertiliser at the scene – planted by a 'people's militia' group. In fact, the explosion was caused by a barometric bomb which has a security level on a par with nuclear weapon components. However public opinion had been mobilised against the 'problem' of the 'people's militia' movement and consequently accepted Clinton's 'solutions' of increased FBI powers to infiltrate and attack these groups, the military enforcement of domestic laws, and a media ban on so-called 'anti-government' extremists such as the People's Militia who are fully aware of the workings of America's secret government. l Environmental Movement A good example of both these methods of manipulation – problem-generating in order to have a solution accepted and control of both sides of the 'debate – is the way that environmental issues have been used in order to justify centralisation of power. Our planet is in environmental crisis and the vast majority of the Green movement is working positively for the good of the Earth, but when environmentalists can aid the New World Order the Elite have no compunction about leaping on the proverbial band wagon. The Elite's environmental stance is largely co-ordinated by the Club of Rome, launched by the Freemason Aurelio Peccei in 1968. Its purpose is to issue propaganda about the environmental crisis to justify centralisation of power, the suppression of industrial development in the Third World and eugenics. Under its influence the Global 2000 report was produced during Jimmy Carter's Trilateral administration which used untrue 'shock' data to paint a picture of overpopulation and food/resource shortages. The response document called for population control and the restriction of scientific development in the Third World. It is on the back of these documents that the genuine environmental movement is calling for a global solution to a global problem – a view the Elite wholeheartedly endorses. Highly involved in these documents were bankers and politicians who support the IMF and the World Bank which are causing the very devastation of the planet they profess to be concerned about. 'Debt for equity' schemes in which 'environmentally sensitive' land is given by the Third World as payment for debts (which in reality does not even reduce the debt) are the brainchild of David Rockefeller and Baron Rothschild. The same people were behind the Rio Summit in 1992 where the secretary-general was the millionaire oilman Maurice Strong, also a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation. All these 'problems' to which centralisation and eugenics are the proffered 'solutions' are caused by the existing policies of the banks, multinational corporations, the World Bank, the IMF etc.. Create the problem, offer the solution...?"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The environmental movement has also been used to prohibit the exploitation of nuclear power. (Personally I am not in favour of nuclear power, but I can still see how the issue has been manipulated to serve the Elite.). The oil and petrochemical industries form the backbone of the Elite's income and recruitment. The oil price shocks in the 1970s were manipulated by the 'Seven Sisters' oil cartel and the Bilderberg Group to massively inflate the price of oil. Conventionally, nuclear power forms the only credible alternative to fossil fuels so it had to de discredited. One of the Bilderbergers who agreed to the increase was Robert O. Anderson, owner of Atlantic Richfield Oil Co of the board of Kissinger Associates. He channelled huge sums of money into organisations to oppose nuclear fuel including a grant to establish a group which developed into Friends of the Earth. Research also suggests that the French arm of the House of Rothschild has been seeking to monopolise nuclear power technology and reprocessing technology in time for the predicted exhaustion of oil and gas supplies. The Rothschilds now control 80% of the world's uranium supplies. The manipulation has also occurred on an international stage. In the 1980s Pakistan, under Ali Bhutto, proposed independent expansion of its nuclear power programme. Kissinger's threats weren't sufficient to stop Bhutto so a Kissinger-inspired coup removed him from power and the world passively looked on as he was hanged. Mind Manipulation Mind control experiments, so-called Nazi science, has been on-going for decades using esoteric knowledge about the human psyche. By ridiculing any spiritual interpretation of life and mobilising the forces of conventional science the Elite have convinced the public of the non-existence of psychic, 'higher' levels so it is easy to keep hidden technology which manipulates these levels. Mass hypnosis is possible by the repetition of a basic theme until it is accepted as fact by the subconscious and then conscious mind. Such messages can be flashed during t.v. programmes or films and are not perceived by the eyes and conscious mind. Alternatively, the mesmerising and sedating effect of television puts the subconscious mind into an ideal state to receive messages sent to the psyche via carrier t.v./radio waves. It is understood by Elite science how, by broadcasting at certain frequencies, non-physical magnetic levels can be imbalanced to cause physical, emotional and mental illness. Technology also exists whereby thoughts can be induced by stimulating brainwaves. The most sinister and far-reaching mind control programme is Project MK Ultra, run on behalf of the CIA. During Operation Paperclip, Nazi scientists were moved to the US and given prestigious positions at the leading colleges, universities and NASA after World War II to continue their experiments in which thousands of 'lesser human beings' – prisoners, mental patients, victims of paedophilia and incest etc. – have been forced to participate. Experiments have included removing a person's existing personality by electrotherapy and then compartmentalising and programming new ones by psychic driving. This makes the 'subject' obsessed with certain ideas and is undoubtedly used to 'programme' so-called lone assassins. The CIA openly admit to having used this form of subversive technology for use against America's political enemies but flatly denies that it would ever be used on home territory. Project Monarch An integral part of MK-Ultra is Project Monarch – perhaps the most damning episode in the history of mind control – whereby the minds of women and children are brutally taken over in order to provide paedophiles, politicians, criminals and practising Satanists with willing sex slaves who could also double as covert operatives by having their personalities and memories switched on and off at will. (See also Further Examples of Manipulation – Satanists)"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The details of this horrific plan by the Elite to take over the planet through mass mind-control have come from the ex-CIA mind-controlled slave, Cathy O'Brien, and are described in harrowing detail in her book Trance Formation Of America. After a lifetime in the clutches of the MK-Ultra Project Monarch mind-control program she became what is known as a 'Presidential Model', a sex slave used specifically by the presidents for perverted abuse. Her abusers include the presidents Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and George Bush as well as a host of other key US politicians. These fiends would routinely torture and rape her and later her daughter, Kelly, for personal gratification whilst using drugs and electric shock trauma to further compartmentalise her memory of such events in order to hide their actions. Because of her status and entirely programmable mind Cathy was used in many major political/criminal covert operations and was used to pass on Top Secret information in such affairs as the Iran-Contra deals. Cathy's life began as the victim of multigenerational paedophilic incest. Her first memory in life is being choked by her father's penis in her throat. This initial trauma began to cause her mind to compartmentalise into separate personalities which could deal with traumatic situations – as a mental survival tool – whilst her 'normal' personality was left to deal with everyday events. Her mind dissociated from the memory of abuse whilst developing another personality which belonged to her father and was triggered on the sight of his arousal. This was the beginning of the creation within Cathy's psyche of a phenomenon known as Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), now known as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). One side-effect of MPD is the creation of a photographic memory. Since her rescue and de-programming in 1988, Cathy has been able to recall in stunning detail every encounter with her adversaries and their sordid plans for world domination. These were freely revealed to Cathy by leading US politicians and criminals over a number of years whilst presuming that their high-tech programming could never be interfered with and it was therefore safe to do so. Another side-effect of the programming is the development of a visual acuity which is 44 times that of the average person. Subsequent abuse came daily from her father and uncles who had also been victims of paedophile parents. Separate personalities were created for each situation, whilst Cathy was still little more than a toddler. Her Uncle Bob, a regular paedophilic abuser, often boasted to her that he was a pilot in Air Force Intelligence and worked for the Vatican. It was Bob who first introduced Cathy to child pornographer and head of the local Michigan Mafia, Gerald Ford (of the Warren Commission who investigated the death of JFK, and later became President of the US after Nixon). Ford had begun recruiting 'Multigenerational incest abused children with MPD for its genetic mind-control studies' , a Top Secret Defence Intelligence Agency project. By selling Cathy into this programme, her father gained immunity from prosecution having recently been caught selling pornography which involved Cathy and her pet boxer dog, Buster. Her father was soon enrolled on a two week course at Harvard where he was taught his role in preparing Cathy for the project. He then returned home to enthusiastically announce that the family would be having more children. Cathy now has two sisters and four brothers; each victims of paedophilic abuse. Preparation for The Project was based upon continual trauma, food and water deprivation, sensory deprivation and included constantly slave driving Cathy into exhaustion just like Cinderella. She was repeatedly prostituted to local Freemasons, police, a Catholic priest, Satanists and relatives in order that she further dissociated and enforced the realisation that there was no place to run and hide. She was also prostituted to Michigan State Senator, Guy VanderJagt (later US Congressman and chairman of the Republican National Congressional Committee which appointed George Bush as president) who gave her a Rosy Cross necklace and told her that he and her Uncle Bob had been to the Vatican where the secrets of other dimensions of existence were kept. On one occasion, both he and Ford brutally raped her in an horrific threesome backstage at a political parade; they then took the stage in front of the crowd which included all of Cathy's schoolmates to present her with a US flag which only moments previously they had inserted into her rectum."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Despite these daily horrors she excelled at her studies; due mainly to her photographic memory. No one had any idea that any of this was going on. In 1968, VanderJagt introduced Cathy to the Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau who then abused her and used her for porn involving a French poodle which he had given her as a pet. Once Cathy reached adolescence and began to develop breasts, VanderJagt found her less attractive and she was 'given' to US Senator and Ku Klux Klan affiliate, Robert C. Byrd who found pleasure in repeatedly torturing her in Sado-Masochistic sex and porn from which she still bears the scars all over her body. By now Cathy was unable to tell reality from dreams and vice versa. This was reinforced through an advanced form of mind-control known as 'Satanic reversals' whereby every sensory input was controlled and words and sentences perverted to always have sinister double or triple meanings pertaining to abuse. She was further prepared for Project Monarch when she was taken out of school and relocated at Muskegon Catholic Central High School, with other Monarch 'Chosen Ones' as they were referred to. The final event which literally drove Cathy out of her mind and destroyed her one remaining 'normal' personality happened in 1974 after a parade in Cedar Springs, Michigan when Ford brutally assaulted her and delivered electric shock treatment in order that she would forget the event. Now every compartment of her mind was associated with abuse. The programme soon began to involve high-tech military bases for further traumatisation and programming. For this they used centres such as the MacDill Airforce Base at Tampa; Fort Campbell in Kentucky; Fort McKlellen at Anniston, Alabama; Redstone Arsenal and Marshall Space Flight Centre in Huntsville, Alabama; the NASA Kennedy Space Centre, Cape Canaveral in Florida and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Centre near Washington D.C.. Cathy was sold and 'married' to her owner, Byrd in a contract which made her father a millionaire overnight. Although 'owned' by Byrd, Cathy was given 'handlers' to keep an eye on and further traumatise her. One such person was Wayne Cox, a Satanist and serial killer his calling card is to remove one hand of his victims which he calls the 'Hands of Glory') who had gained immunity from prosecution through his involvement in Project Monarch. He was introduced to Cathy whilst playing for a country music band at the Grand Old Opry in Nashville, Tennessee. According to Cathy, no one makes it in this town unless they are slaves or CIA operatives. Names of leading slave handlers and CIA operatives include Kris Kristofferson (described by Cathy as a 'Vatican based Project Monarch slave runner' ), Boxcar Willie (who has abused Cathy's daughter, Kelly, in three separate mental institutions) and Merle Haggard – whose song 'Freedom Train' is the code-word for this aspect of the mind-control plan. Project Monarch Slaves include the singer Barbara Mandrell and her sisters, who are also owned by Byrd, and Loretta Lynn who's handler is Neo-Nazi paedophile and CIA operative, Ken Riley. Cox involved Cathy in drug running and cannibalistic Satanism with his mother. He also caused her to conceive six times in order to use the foetuses in these rituals and became the natural father of Cathy's only daughter, Kelly, who was born in 1980. During one drug run with Cox to Tinker Air Force Base in Ouachita National Forrest near Hot Springs, Arkansas, Cathy met, then Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton. She was then cued to reveal to him a secret message from Senator Bennett Johnson of Louisiana and then handed over a particularly fine batch of cocaine (Clinton's drug of choice) for his personal use. In 1980, Cathy was programmed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky by Lt. Colonel Michael Aquino, a confessed neo-Nazi and founder of the Himmler-inspired Temple of Set (Satan), who holds Top Secret clearance in the DIA's Psychological Warfare Division (he was also once charge with ritual and sexual abuse of children at the Presidio Day Care Centre in San Francisco). He used atrocious trauma techniques using NASA technology on both Cathy and Kelly."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Perversely, Lucifarian religions are constitutionally protected in the USA and Britain! One sex slave training camp is known as the 'Charm School' in Youngstown, Ohio and is operated by the 'Governor', Dick Thornburgh (Governor of Pennsylvania, US Attorney General and secretary for the UN). Here he worked with Congressman Jim Trafficant using high-tech programming techniques. A further insight into the New World Order mentality comes from these passages from Trance Formation of America: (Byrd) often threatened me that I was considered 'disposable' because after all, \"The first Presidential Model, Marilyn Monroe, was killed right in front of the public eye and no one knew what happened\". ' Furthermore: ...he loved to hear himself talk and would often drone on and on in his famous long-winded recitations, while I was photographically recording every word he said. He detailed the inner operational structure of the world domination effort, including psychological warfare strategies, and explained how he had and would use his 'expert' knowledge of the Constitution to manipulate it and the so called US Justice System, and more. ...Byrd 'justified' mind-control atrocities as a means of thrusting mankind into accelerated evolution, according to the Neo-Nazi principles to which he adhered. He 'justified' manipulating mankind's religion to bring about the prophesied biblical 'world peace' through the 'only means available' – total mind-control in the New World Order. 'After all,' he proclaimed, ' even the Pope and the Mormon Prophet know this is the only way to peace and they co-operate fully with The Project . ' (my highlights added) ...He adhered to the belief that 95% of the (world's) people WANT to be led by the 5%, and claimed that this can be proven because the 95% DO NOT WANT TO KNOW what really goes on in government.' Byrd believed that in order for this world to survive, mankind must take a 'giant step in evolution through creating a 'superior race', Byrd believed in the Nazi and KKK principles of 'annihilation of underprivileged races and cultures' through genocide, to alter genetics and breed 'the more gifted – the blondes of this world'. Cathy's first position as a 'Presidential Model' was to Ronald Reagan – known to slaves as 'The Wizard of OZ'. One of his favourite pastimes was perverted porn – especially bestiality. He would instruct his personal pornographer, Larry Flynt (owner of Hustler magazine) to make pictures to his own specifications which became known as 'Uncle Ronnie's Bedtime Stories'. Reagan's personal attaché, Philip Habib's favourite pastime was to sodomise Cathy whilst electrocuting her to create the desired rectal spasm. Habib later introduced her to King Fahd of Saudi Arabia whose tastes were frighteningly similar. Fahd was to fund the Contras via Panamanian Dictator and CIA operative, Manuel Noriega for Reagan and Cathy was used as the messenger in 'Operation Carrier Pidgeon'. One of the most brutal of all of Cathy's abusers was Dick Cheney (White House Chief of Staff to Ford, member of the CFR and later Secretary of Defence to Reagan – despite having no military background). He would regularly organise an event known as 'A Most Dangerous Game'. This involved releasing Monarch slaves into the woods and then hunting them down with dogs and guns for sport as a means of further traumatising victims as well as for his own perversity. One operation, organised by Cheney and Ford was 'Operation Shell Game'. This involved Cathy being used as a 'Carrier Pidgeon': He (Ford) began talking as though I were a machine and he was dictating a message. 'Take this message to Dick Chaney, Pentagon. The Mob has agreed to transfer the $2.3 million"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"(porn profits) to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Let's pool our money now and we'll be swimming in it. This operation has been an enterprising success. Let's keep it that way. Cease agreement with Panama. All Mexican channels are implemented (cocaine and heroin). Hail to the chief'. As a replacement for Cox, Cathy was given a new handler; paedophile, ventriloquist and hypnotist, Alex Houston. (Cox now breeds goats for Satanic rituals and runs a trade in human body parts for Satanists.) In 1982, Houston dealt cocaine to Bill Clinton whilst Cathy was taken to meet his wife, Hilary Clinton. At the sight of Cathy's vagina (which had previously been mutilated without anaesthetic to resemble a demon's head – the head of Baphomet which is worshipped by the Templars and their offshoots) Hilary Clinton became aroused and performed oral sex upon her. In 1983, George Bush began sodomising and electrocuting Kelly, now merely three and a half years old. Her rectum usually bled for days after. Furthermore, constant threats were made by Bush on Kelly's life in order to keep Cathy in line. He also claimed to be an ET and could activate a holographic image within Cathy's mind in which he would change into a lizard-like alien creature. Bohemian Grove in California is an exclusive club where all sexual and satanic perversions are catered for – including necrophilia. Attendees are referred to as 'Grovers'. Reagan's Secretary of Education and later Legal Counsel to Clinton, Bill Bennett and his brother Bob assaulted Kelly here in 1988. Bennett has intimate knowledge of Catholic/Jesuit mind-control techniques and is using them to implement 'Education 2000' which is , 'designed to increase children's learning capacity while destroying the ability to think for themselves' . Bennett, like Bush, also claims to be an alien. Another plan known as World Vision is a Jesuit fund raising operation to implement world peace through mind-control. The Order of the Rose – a Templar derivative – is very prominent among the New World Order brigade. Many slaves have a red rose tattooed on their left wrists. The Canadian Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney is also part of this clique, as is VandrJegt and Madelaine Albright who, according to Bush, '...rose in the UN through me to implement the New World Order'. Among the Order of the Rose, George Bush is referred to as 'The Rose'. In 1986, Cathy and Kelly were taken to Mount/Lake Shasta in California under the guise of a music festival run by Merle Haggard. This is the base for a multi-juristictional police force which will be used to enforce the New World Order with an arsenal of black helicopters and an army of mind-controlled military personnel. Here, Bush and Cheney played the 'Most Dangerous Game' with Cathy. As a punishment for being caught, Bush (under the influence of his favourite drug – heroin) sodomised Kelly and burnt Cathy's thighs with a red hot poker. When Cathy was 29 she became aware that Presidential Models were not allowed to live much beyond the age of 30. Plans were formed and agreed with Reagan that she would meet her end in a Snuff Movie whereby she would be burned alive. At this point Senator Patrick Leahy (Vice Chairman on US Senate Intelligence Committee and close friend of Byrd) 'acquired' her for a time. At his own personal torture lab he abused Cathy which included slowly inserting a wire into her right eye whilst forcing Kelly to watch. In February 1988, two months after Cathy's thirtieth birthday, both she and Kelly were abducted from Alex Houston by his business partner and former CIA operative Mark Phillips – acknowledged by the US mental health and law enforcement officials as an expert in 'the most secret technology known to man: Trauma-based mind control' which is 'The only form of human control that is absolute' . He managed to smuggle them out of the clutches of their captors to Alaska with the aid of 'insider' assistance in the 'intelligence community' and began an intensive de-programming which has culminated in the recovery of Cathy's sanity as well as the information outlined in Trance Formation Of America . It was also discovered that Kelly had been 'programmed' by Wayne Cox to die by using a mind-control"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"technique known as 'hypnosleep'. This manifested in chronic and increasingly severe asthma. According to Phillips the present field of mental health is so backward that: In the present climate, referring mind-controlled victims to mental health professionals for treatment would be tantamount to subjecting a patient needing delicate surgery to a surgeon who was blind-folded and hand-cuffed. The subsequent lives of the threesome has been one filled with trauma, death threats and legal battles. Kelly is now effectively a political prisoner in a mental institution because of her suicidal tendencies and is not allowed to have contact with Phillips – one of the few people who could help her to regain her sanity. All requests for legal investigations into the claims made by them to the legal authorities have been prevented 'For reasons of National Security' , despite the mass of verifiable evidence which they have been able to uncover This is due to the loopholes created by the National security Act, 1947 and the 1986 Reagan Amendment, which means that the government can censor and/or cover up anything in the interests of National Security. The extraordinary bravery of Cathy, Kelly and Mark has seen to it that this abuse and its perpetrators will be held accountable for their actions. Through their mass publicity attempts in the face of death at every turn we now have a pretty clear picture of the mentality of the New World Order Elite operatives. It is now up to all of us to see that such sacrifice has not been in vain. According to my sources in Britain. The British counterpart to Project Monarch is Project Ultra Green and was initiated by a Nazi scientist named Grunenberg. One US security agency, the National Security Agency, which wields the power behind the CIA and is heavily involved in the Black Ops and Black Arts has a base in England at a place called Menwith Hill which is near Ilkley Moor in North Yorkshire. Here the Elite operate a covert surveillance operation of Britain which includes a mass phone tapping system (try dropping a few of the code names mentioned in this book into your conversations on the phone and you will hear the 'clicks' in the background as their recording machinery is activated by specific 'buzz words') and high-tech satellite surveillance operation which was developed under the cover of Reagan's 'Star Wars' Programme. Interestingly, George Lucas, the writer and director of the Star Wars movies is named by Cathy O'Brien as a NASA/NSA operative. Fluoride The apathy of the public towards their manipulation has also been influenced very deliberately by the addition of chemicals to food and water supplies. For example, this happened when sodium fluoride was introduced into our water supply and the majority of our tooth-pastes, supposedly to prevent dental caries in the under twelve-year-olds. What they did not tell the public was that sodium fluoride is a highly toxic by-product of the aluminium manufacturing process and the refining of phosphate rock (see Further Examples of Manipulation – The BSE Case) which was once used as rat poison and also pollutes the atmosphere and water environment due to overuse of the aerosol propellants Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Fluorine is a major component of most of today's major sedative drugs and even new supposedly less addictive drugs such as Prozac (Fluoxetine) and its derivatives. (Prozac also contains benzene which is, according to the World Health Organisation, 'a known carcinogen with no known safe level' . Prozac is currently the world's most popular anti-depressant despite having documented side-effects such as: suicidal ideation, violent behaviour, nervousness, anxiety, insomnia, anorexia and sexual dysfunction!) The following statement is extracted from 'Address in Reply to the Government's Speech to Parliament', as recorded in Victorian Hansard of 12 August 1987, by Mr Harley Rivers Dickinson, Liberal Party Member of the Victorian Parliament for South Barwon. Hence the title. At the end of the Second World War, the United States Government sent Charles Eliot"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Perkins, a research worker in chemistry, biochemistry, physiology and pathology, to take charge of the vast Farben chemical plants in Germany. While there he was told by the German chemists of a scheme which had been worked out by them during the war and adopted by the German General Staff. This was to control the population in any given area through mass medication of drinking water. In this scheme, sodium fluoride occupied a prominent place. Repeated doses of infinitesimal amounts of fluoride will in time reduce an individual's power to resist domination by slowly poisoning and narcotising a certain area of the brain and will thus make him submissive to the will of those who wish to govern him. Both the Germans and the Russians added sodium fluoride to the drinking water of prisoners of war to make them stupid and docile.' After the war, I.G. Farben was dismantled but later emerged in the many guises of the companies with whom they had signed cartel agreements including Procter and Gamble, the company who domesticated the word fluoride with official encouragement in 1958 with the 'Crest' fluoridated toothpaste campaign. Moreover, an adviser to the US Government on hypnotism and psychological behaviour control, Dr. George Estabrooks, later became Chairman, Department of Psychology, Colgate University. Internationally, Colgate was and remains the most ardent producer and advocate for the fluoridation of toothpaste. Fluoride is active in parts per million and acts as a potentiator for other drugs, i.e. it increases their effect. In 1954, Charles Elliot Perkins, scientist and author stated: 'The real purpose behind water fluoridation is to reduce the resistance of the masses to domination and control and loss of liberty' and, 'I can say this in all earnestness and sincerity as a scientist who has spent nearly twenty years research into the chemistry, bio-chemistry, physiology and pathology of fluorine: any person who drinks artificially fluorinated water for a period of one year or more will never again be the same person, mentally or physically'. Interestingly, the chemical industry now has a mass market for a once hard to dispose of toxic waste material and the Illuminati have a sedated and more easily controlled population. A Microchipped Population In the Elite's misguided judgement the ideal form of control will be via a microchipped population connected to a global computer. Money will be obsolete and all financial transactions will be carried out via a microchip inserted under the skin used in much the same way as a credit or smart card – swipe your wrist over the sensor to pay for your goods. Convenient, easy... and enables the Elite to have complete knowledge about you and your transactions. With no cash alternative if your 'wrist' is refused for some reason you can be prevented from buying anything and effectively ostracised from society. Moves to implement this are already underway and public opinion is being softened up to accept it: in the 1970s Swedish hospital patients were implanted without their knowledge; pets, new-born babies in maternity wards and criminals are being electronically tagged; a need for identity cards is being expressed (to combat crime); supermarkets are experimenting with bar-coded cards to keep a tally of purchases without the need for check-out assistants; the 'pay at the pump' systems recently introduced in some petrol stations; and in 1994 the Intel Corporation was given a five year contract to research into an under the skin microchip for identity/financial transactions. IBM have already developed an invisible bar coding system of three sets of six numbers which is painless and can be 'installed' on the skin by laser in a fraction of a second without the person being aware of its"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"existence and is currently in use on cattle. Watch out for gradual insistence on personal computerisation and electrical devices which could potentially be used to control us all. Remember, they create problems and then offer solutions . Dr. Carl W. Sanders is an electronics engineer, inventor, author and consultant with various government organisations as well as IBM and General Electric. He spent thirty two years developing microchip technology for use in medicine which resulted in the chip which he describes as 'the Mark of the Beast'. It is a tiny chip which is recharged by body temperature and whose prime location would, therefore, be in the forehead, just below the hairline, or alternatively on the back of the hand. This chip has been tested as a contraception device in India and as a behaviour modifier in Vietnam veterans, amongst other things. A specific identification chip was developed which contained details of a person's name, picture of their face, security number, finger print, physical description, family history, address, occupation, income tax information and criminal record. Dr. Sanders admits to attending many 'One World' meetings with Henry Kissinger and people from the CIA where it was discussed, 'How can you control people if you cannot identify them?' and, 'How do you make people aware of the need for something like this chip?' The answer was simple, 'Let's make them aware of lost children etc.' The CIA then came up with the idea of putting pictures of lost children on milk cartons, a procedure which ceased when the microchip became accepted. Bills have been put before Congress in the USA that will allow the government to microchip children at birth, The president of the USA, under the 'Control of Imigration Act of 1986', Section 100, has the authority to deem whatever type of identification is necessary. All of these sinister ploys are merely waiting in the wings to happen, and they have been manipulated into existence with the same problem/solution tactics which have been used for centuries to control the world's population. Indeed, this interesting passage from the book of Revelation in the Christian Bible does appear to prophesy something similar to the human bar/microchip coding system: 'And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number [is] Six hundred threescore [and]six.' Revelation 13:16-18 As well as messages from the chip to the computer, messages can also be sent the other way – in much the same way as satellite t.v. receivers can be programmed remotely. As long ago as 1966, a CIA psychologist was talking about brain control through two-way communication between an implanted brain and a computer. Once a chip has been inserted there will be no end to the aspects of our lives which can be controlled – birth control, programmed actions to create more 'problems' demanding 'solutions', etc. A robot society will have been created. "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" Watergate | Iran-Contra | The Drugs Trade | Satanism | The BSE Case part 8 FURTHER EXAMPLES OF MANIPULATION The abuse of power and exploitation for personal and corporate gain by the visible components of the Elite hierarchy is quite astonishing. In the following cases we have been duped into believing as truth the version of events portrayed by the mass media. Watergate In 1972, a Republican surveillance team working for Nixon's re-election committee, subsequently named the 'Plumbers', broke into the Democrat headquarters at the Watergate Buildings in Washington. This was engineered by Kissinger and his protégé George Bush to remove the final pretence of 'democracy' and hand complete control of the US administration to the Elite. As Head of the State Department and the National Security Council, Kissinger effectively ran the Nixon presidency. The 'Plumbers' were agents working for the White House Special Investigations Unit, created by Nixon (Kissinger) with money from the president of Bush-owned Pennzoil and other business associates of George Bush. At the time the Watergate story broke, Bush had been made chairman of the Republican National Committee yet claimed to have no knowledge of the situation. After the break-in became public knowledge, Nixon was eventually forced to resign on the release of recordings in which he discussed ways to frustrate the Watergate investigations. The recordings were done by David Young, who worked for the Rockefellers and was appointed by Kissinger, and they were revealed by Butterworth, the White House liaison with the Kissinger-led secret service. In the same recordings, Nixon implicated certain 'Texans' which referred to Bush and his associates, but Nixon was forced out of office before the trial at which this would have been revealed. Gerald Ford. a 33rd degree freemason and Rockefeller puppet, became president and pardoned Nixon so that the case never came to court. He appointed Nelson Rockefeller to be his vice-president and put him in charge of the Watergate investigations, which, unsurprisingly, discovered nothing of consequence. Iran-Contra In 1975, George Bush, who had been a CIA asset since the 1950s, became director of the CIA which, by a series of measures implemented by President Ford (Rockefeller), had increasing power over the US Intelligence services. As his associate deputy director for covert operations Bush named Theodore Shackley who, with Oliver North, had masterminded Operation Phoenix in Vietnam and ran an assassination and drugs operation throughout the 1970s with Donald Gregg and Felix Rodriquez. During the 1979-80 election campaign Shackley became Bush's speech writer (?!) and when Bush became vice-president under Reagan, Gregg, assisted by Rodriquez, was appointed as his main advisor on national security. Oliver North also became an official on the National Security Council. Working out of Bush's office this group co-ordinated the arms-for-drugs racket that has become known as Iran-Contra. The Sandinista regime in Nicaragua sought to pursue the interests of its own economy and people rather than US corporate interests so the rebel Contras were backed by the CIA. They were supplied with arms in"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"exchange for drugs which were flown on CIA chartered planes into Homestead Airforce Base using a CIA code signal. One trafficker flew weapons to the Contras in return for CIA help in flying cocaine into the US via an airstrip of one of North's CIA associates. Oliver North also co-ordinated the arms-for-hostages deals with Iran. The money was laundered through the Elite's banking headquarters in Switzerland. One reason for the deals with Iran was to pay back the Khomeini regime for it delaying the release of 51 US hostages to prevent Carter taking the credit. Once he had been replaced by Reagan/Bush the hostages were released as arranged at a meeting in Paris between Iranian officials and Bush, Gregg and John Tower. When the scandal became public Tower led the investigations into the affair which did not prosecute Bush or Reagan and those that were identified as being involved were pardoned by Bush before public trials. Tower was to die in a plane crash just when he was beginning to talk openly about the affair. The Drugs Trade The trade in hard drugs is very important to the Elite for a number of reasons: it provides a source of income to finance other covert operations; it creates a 'problem' for which the public demands a 'solution' of increased police powers and the erosion of personal freedom in an effort to stop the supply; and, by addicting large numbers of particularly the younger generation to hard drugs, self-respect and the ability to think independently are diminished. The background to many engineered conflicts is illuminated by analysis of the drug implications. In Vietnam a Pepsi Cola bottling plant was a drug distribution point with CIA helicopters supplying it with drugs from the fields. Drugs were also smuggled back to the US in the body cavities of carefully labelled corpses. In 1986, Bo Gritz, America's most decorated war hero was sent by the US government into Burma's infamous 'Golden Triangle' to report on missing US prisoners of war. He discovered a man named Khun Sa who is deemed to be the overlord of heroin in the world, sending an ever-increasing excess of 1000 tons of heroin into the 'free' world per year. He also discovered that the whole rescue mission of the prisoners was being prevented by the CIA because these soldiers knew too many details of the operation between Khun Sa and the CIA to traffic these drugs. Later, he was told by Jerry King, head of Intelligence Support Activity (ISA) in the CIA that '...we've been ordered to put operation Grand Eagle (the rescue mission) on the shelf as if it never existed. There are still too many beurocrats that don't want to see American prisoners of war come back alive.' The conflict between the US and Panama was a result of Bush turning against Noriega who was a CIA asset while Bush was director and who had been paid to run drugs. However, having seized power in 1984, despite losing the democratic election and yet still being officially recognised by President Reagan, Noriega incurred US wrath by refusing to bow to their pressure for his country to invade Nicaragua. The US suddenly turned against the Panama administration under the pretext of drugs, corruption and a lack of democracy. In 1988, Noriega was indicted on drug charges all bar one of which pre-dated 1984, to a time when he was still on the CIA payroll. In order to arrest one man the US invaded Panama in 1989, killing 3000 civilians. Allegedly the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) paid him $4.7 million to keep quiet about CIA involvement and at his trial no CIA documents were allowed to be examined. A new government was installed by the US, headed by a president and vice-president involved with banks known for drug money laundering and under this new administration drug trafficking from Panama has increased. Nixon and Reagan and George Bush (despite the latter two being regular heroin users), have led public campaigns against drugs which unsurprisingly have achieved little. In association with the major drug cartels, the CIA has arranged small 'busts' to lend credibility to the campaigns but these are usually to remove insignificant players or larger ones who have outlived their usefulness. In 1981, during the"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Reagan/Bush administration, the CIA convened a meeting of Columbian dealers to form the Medellin Cartel – an infamous group of 200 dealers. There is also evidence to suggest that the Zapata Oil Corporation is a CIA front and that Zapata Offshore is involved in drug smuggling. Both of these companies were set up and are headed by Bush. George Bush was succeeded in the White House by Bill Clinton, a Rhodes Scholar, whose drug credentials are on a par with his predecessor. Whilst Governor of Arkansas he created the Arkansas Development Finance Authority (ADFA) which was to finance drug trafficking. All loan applications were handled by the Rose Law Firm, run by Hilary Clinton, and those which were granted were to Clinton's business associates for use in trafficking. For example, one loan was given to Web Hubbel of Park-O-Meter which manufactured retrofit nose cones for drug shipping. The loans were not paid back, but large donations were given to Clinton's election fund. Web Hubbel became acting US attorney general under Clinton, and some think he still fulfils that role behind Janet Reno. During the Reagan/Bush anti-drug campaign, whilst Clinton governed Arkansas, the United State's biggest drug trafficking operation was set up in Mena Arkansas by a DEA pilot. Many people speaking out or investigating Bill Clinton have died in mysterious circumstances, for which the official cause of death is given as 'suicide'. Conveniently, in a law introduced into Arkansas by Clinton just prior to the first suspicious deaths no autopsy needs to be performed in cases of deaths attributed to suicide. Satanism One of the most sinister elements to the manipulation of society is the abuse of esoteric knowledge by the world's secret societies both for the purposes of political control and for sick personal pleasure. In the US each year 400,000 children are reported missing, and in the UK this number is 98,000. Not all are recovered. All over the world children are hijacked into a life of sexual abuse, psychological and physical torture. They are bought and sold by members of paedophile rings, often by their own parents, who act as 'recruiters' and 'handlers' in the lower echelons of the secret society network. They are systematically abused, tortured and murdered in ritualistic ceremonies by people who occupy places throughout the social hierarchy all the way to the top. Eye witness accounts, such as those given by a friend of mine named Patti who was 'recruited' as a child of three, have implicated members of the aristocracy, doctors, lawyers, members of the clergy, high level businessmen, media stars, members of the world's governments (see Who We Are – Mind Manipulation/Project Monarch). Sophisticated mind control techniques are used to compartmentalise the memories of the abused to prevent them from revealing the awful truth to the public. Patti has displayed many separate personalities whilst recounting her horrific experiences, displaying the classic symptoms of Multiple Personality Disorder. Often victims are too scared to even mention such things to each other, never mind to strangers. They are brought up in the certain knowledge that they can be easily picked up off the streets or from their beds and drugged for use in abuse at any time. They are fully aware also that their abusers are everywhere, including in the medical professions and police. Victims are ceremonially 'married' to the leaders of the cult and are given their own 'dark companion', a sinister thought-form who will be ever present in order to inform on them if they should ever step out of line. They are often forced to take part in the abuse, murder and disposal of other victims in order to ensure a total attack upon the psyche of the individual concerned and the victim is soon convinced that they have become at least as guilty of these crimes as their assailants. Therefore, they are ever paranoid and terrified of revealing the truth to anyone other that those who have themselves been victims."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Methods of abuse are truly horrendous and include: live burials with the uncertainty of being retrieved, physical mutilation, sexual abuse, the enforced killing of family members and animals which have previously been given as pets, the enforced pregnancy for the purpose of subsequent removal of the child for sacrifice, the enforced drinking of blood, eating of faeces and cannibalism upon bodies of sacrificial victims, general sustained humiliation etc.. The list is as long as the imagination of the perpetrators of such atrocities allows it to be. Many of the Satanic rituals are performed at the altars of out of the way and redundant churches for the purpose of generating terror and negativity within these sacred sites. The energy is then harnessed for personal power and the perpetuation of the Luciferic force upon the Earth (as well as to further traumatise their slaves for mind-control purposes such as Project Ultra Green/MK-Ultra Project Monarch/Freedom Train). In this way the Earth's energy matrix – the collective unconscious, which is continuous with the human psyche, is kept in a negatively imbalanced state – whilst the sickest members of the human race have an obscene outlet for their perverse fantasies.. The British intelligence agencies and the USA's CIA and NSA are well aware of such organised anathemata including the identities of those involved and the code names used for such operations, such as Ultra Green and Project Monarch. Patti herself has given her details to various agencies including England's Scotland Yard. However, this global underbelly is so deeply entrenched in the System that these people are left entirely untouched by the legal system. Many cult-busting and rescue organisations exist, most working in tandem with the police (who are rife with this problem), but are themselves kept a closely guarded secret, supposedly in order to minimise the problem of infiltration. This is yet another way of maintaining overall secrecy via compartmentalisation within the pyramidal structure in order to preserve the status quo. Even today, at the age of thirty seven, Patti is regularly picked up off the streets to be drugged, raped, tortured or made to actually perform in Satanic ceremonies in the role of one of her personalities which is a priestess within the cult. All of which further traumatises her and enforces the compartmentalisation of her personalities. Her assailants also have an intimate knowledge of black magic and are able to summon her remotely to various locations under the control of her various personalities in order to abduct her. One evening, Patti had paid Shona a visit whilst I was at work and spent the entire night flipping from one personality to another. These personalities ranged from the totally meek, 'Nothing', aged three, through variously aged 'Patricias' to the quite nasty and foul-mouthed 'Cathy'. In the early hours she became obsessed with leaving the house to take part in a ritual which she knew was taking place nearby and expressed an overwhelming desire to drink blood. This began at ten past three – the time which Satanists associate with Satan's greatest moment upon Earth – the time of the Crucifixion of Jesus. A little after five, when the ritual would have been completed, Patti began to normalise but revealed to Shona that she had taken a drugs overdose, though not enough to do any serious harm. This was entirely out of character for her as she has spent her life loving and protecting her three children from her 'Family' as she calls them. This did correspond, however, with threats which had been made to her merely a week earlier by five men who had abducted her during a visit to her home town of Darlington, that if she and we did not 'back off' then they would kill her via an injected overdose and make it look like suicide. They had explained to her that this could be prepared easily through a series of manipulated 'suicide attempts' which would give her the appearance of being in a suicidal state. The extensive information which Patti has revealed of the names, dates and methods of the British paedophile/Satanic ring are now in the hands of many individuals throughout Britain. If any 'accident' should 'mysteriously' befall Patti or anyone involved in this book and its distribution, these names along with a mass of evidence (including prominent members of the aristocracy, active politicians, a former British Prime Minister, eye witnesses, the ring leaders and 'lackeys' etc.) will be made public. Furthermore, I wish it to be known that both Shona and I are in perfect mental and physical health and are looking forward to being present throughout the transformation of the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Earth and on into a glorious future. The BSE Case In 1986, in Britain, the first recorded case was recognised of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), a new disease which was affecting the nervous systems of cattle, causing Parkinsonian/ dementia-like symptoms. The official cause was identified by the Ministry for Agriculture Fisheries and Food (MAFF) as cross-contamination of a previously known sheep disease called Scrapie via cattle feeds which contained meat and bone meal from sheep. By 1996, the numbers of cows said to have been infected with BSE had risen to 27,800 despite the ban on meat feeds for cattle in 1989. The increasing incidence of a similar disease in humans called Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease (CJD), in which the brain becomes mushroom-like and full of holes causing sufferers to become gradually more confused until death, has been blamed upon the consumption of infected beef products. Therefore, a mass slaughter of British cattle was initiated in 1996 in order to resolve the problem. BSE has also infected many other animals such as domestic cats, birds of prey and zoo animals given infected meat. Despite assurances that BSE was confined to very few cases, the number of cases of CJD has increased in England from 27 in 1985, to 42 in 1994, and 55 in 1995. Significantly, there are three recognised types of CJD (the types 1 and 2 being similar to Alzheimer's Disease with confusion and memory loss as the main symptoms) whereas the cases of CJD since 1985 have been mainly of a new type-3 (which is indicated by additional loss of muscle co-ordination and balance). This is essentially the story which has been fed to the mass public via the media and has caused a panic among consumers who have begun to avoid British beef products. It even initiated what was described in the press as a 'trade war' with Europe spearheaded by the British Prime Minister John Major in a typical 'white knight' fashion. The truth of the situation is far more sinister and has implications for everyone, meat eaters and vegetarians alike. The discovery was made by organic farmer, Mark Purdy. That is, BSE and type-3 CJD is caused not by an entirely new form of infection (called a prion by the investigating scientists) but is caused by poisoning by organo-phosphate fertilisers. Several inconsistencies have been conveniently overlooked by the 'experts' investigating this case: that no organic farmer (those not using chemicals such as pesticides) has had a case of BSE despite using the same meat/bone-meal feeds as everyone else, and 1. that despite virtually the whole of Europe using these same feeds, there have been very few cases of BSE on the continent. So it can hardly be the Scrapie-contaminated feed, can it? 2. During the Second World War, I.G. Farben (the Nazi chemical company responsible for Zyclon B which was allegedly used to gas the Jews in the Holocaust and who used the inmates of Auschwitz as slave labour and as guinea pigs for testing of chemicals) developed a fluorinated nerve gas known as Sarin which was also used by the Iraquis during the Gulf War. This is an organo-phosphate (OP) compound which is very similar to that used by farmers in low concentrations to spray crops and dip sheep to prevent tick infestation, but it is used in much higher concentrations to treat cattle against warble-fly infestation. In the 1980s, the MAFF began a war against the warble fly and imposed a mode of treatment upon Britain's farmers. This was that twice a year a preparation of OP concentrate be poured over the backs of all cattle. The OP is fat-soluble and is therefore absorbed by cow through the skin for a systemic effect to occur. Subsequently, an imprecise amount of OP is absorbed and the area most exposed to the compound is the spinal column i.e. directly into the central nervous system. The OP kills the warble fly by attacking the nervous system . The reported cases of BSE have been in the areas of warble fly infestation ."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"It has been established that, in cases of BSE, the prion protein in the brain becomes corrupted and mutates causing the familiar spongy brain situation. It has also been established that OPs bind to prion protein causing brain cells to mutate in a chain reaction. – as has been established in the case of the OP, Thalamide, a constituent of Thalidomide, which caused massive birth deformities in the late 60s and early 70s. Human brains also contain prion proteins! Cases of BSE have been significantly higher in Switzerland and Northern Ireland. These countries have one other thing in common with mainland Britain, that is: they also use OPs – predominantly the compound Phosmet – in a strength which is four times that of the rest of Europe . For several years now, many British farmers using OPs have been developing a severely debilitating condition which is not officially recognised despite the many claims and obvious links to OPs. The symptoms which are displayed in this syndrome are: severe malaise and fatigue, chest pain, Parkinson-like tremors and other nervous disorders. However, organic farmers are not affected by this 'mysterious' syndrome. Up to more than 25 times the allowed amounts of OPs have been found in conventionally grown carrots in England. The investigations by (MAFF) showed that, in 8% of carrots, the contents were higher than the international Maximum Residue Level (MRL) limit. OPs both attack the brain and weaken the immune system and are undoubtedly a major factor in the 20th Century disease process such as the increasing incidence of recurrent infections and the immuno-suppressive diseases such as AIDS. The most significant lab tests using this theory have been performed, initiated by Purdey's, research by the Government's Medical Research Council in Britain but have shown to be inconclusive. However, the MRC have admitted that they have not been using actual prion proteins for these tests, but have been experimenting on synthetic prion proteins! Could this be because it was the British Government, through MAFF, in the 1980s who made OPs compulsory and therefore caused BSE? If the truth were accepted then there would be grounds for the recovery of huge sums of money in damages claims both from the government and from the petrochemical producers of the OPs themselves, such as Wellcome and ICI. The Government has clearly been using the BSE crisis in Britain to achieve a political agenda. Meanwhile, the true cause of CJD is kept well hidden. "},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"What is AIDS? | Wellcome to Hell | AID Care and Treatment | Truth - A Cure for All Disease Vivisection - far more than an animal rights issue part 9 THE PHARMACEUTICAL RACKET In the early half of this century the petrochemical giants organised a coup on the medical research establishments, hospitals and universities. The Rockefellers did this by sponsoring research and donating monetary gifts to US universities and medical schools where research was drug based and further extended this policy to foreign medical establishments via their International Education Board. Those who were not drug based were refused funding and were soon dissolved in favour of the more lucrative pharmaceutical-based projects. In 1939 the 'Drug Trust' alliance was formed by the Rockefeller Empire and I.G. Farben. After the war, I.G. Farben was dismantled but later emerged in the many guises of the companies with whom they had signed cartel agreements. These companies include: Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), Borden, Carnation, General Mills, M.W. Kellogg Co., Nestle, Pet Milk, Squibb and Sons, Bristol Meyers, Whitehall laboratories, Procter and Gamble, Roche, Hoechst and Beyer and Co. (two extant pharmaceutical companies who initially employed convicted war criminals Friedrich Jaehne and Fritz ter Meer as board chairmen). The Rockefeller Empire – in tandem with the Chase Manhattan Bank now owns over half of the USA's pharmaceutical interests and is the largest drug manufacturing combine in the world. Since the war the drug industry has steadily netted an ever increasing profit from sales of drugs to become the second largest manufacturing industry in the world next to the arms industry (also owned by the self same Elite agencies). Today, health care is a multi-billion pound industry world-wide with ever increasing expenditure by taxpayers into the system which funnels the majority of this staggering profit into the hands of the drug manufacturers who are, as we have seen, headed by the major Elite manipulators of this century. These companies now control the vast majority of health care and set the standards for the practice of medicine in all developed countries. Doctors are no longer free to choose the most reliable and safe forms of therapy available but are at the mercy of their financial reliance on sponsoring (frequently bribing) drug companies. Once out of drug-company sponsored medical school, doctors embark on a career of increasing workloads and have ever increasing amounts of new pharmaceutical products to use and understand. The sheer volume of literature which a GP will receive from drug sales reps has resulted in the present situation whereby GPs are poorly educated about the chemicals which they are giving to their patients and are essentially gleaning most of their post-graduate training from the salesmen of private business. The moral implications of this are staggering. The number of available drug preparations is now well in excess of 200,000. In 1980, the World Health organisation advised that a mere 240 drugs are necessary in order to provide good health care in the Third World (which should be more than adequate for First World needs considering we are a significantly healthier proportion of the population) whilst in 1981 the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation stated that a mere 26 of these are considered 'indispensables'. Most of the many drugs which are now available are known as 'me-too' drugs, i.e. recombinations and exact reproductions of drugs already available but which are irresistible to other companies who wish to share in their market. For example, the standard analgesics Paracetamol and Aspirin come in a multitude of forms under a variety of"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"different brand names and yet these products can vary in price to a factor of ten or more times for the exact same formula depending on brand type chosen. Often the consumer erroneously presumes that increased price is equivalent to increased quality in this case and are entirely unaware that the drugs they are buying and those which they are rejecting are identical. Doctors are also often guilty of prescribing drugs by trade name and thus netting greater profits for the favoured company whilst cheaper versions are available to the unwary consumer/patient. Usually, before handing in a prescription it pays to consult the attending pharmacist if there is an equivalent and cheaper drug available. This can save some chronic drug users hundreds of pounds per year. Pharmaceutical companies rely upon ill health in the population to survive and reap their profits. No drug company has a vested interest in curing disease. They do, however, have a massive vested interest in maintaining ill-health, creating disease and manufacturing chemicals which will promote this under the guise of 'therapy' for the symptoms – rarely ever the cause – of disease. Dr John Braithwaite, now a Trade Practices Commissioner, in his expose, Corporate Crime in the Pharmaceutical Industry , states: 'International bribery and corruption, fraud in the testing of drugs, criminal negligence in the unsafe manufacturing of drugs – the pharmaceutical industry has a worse record of law-breaking than any other industry.' In the US in 1978 1.5 million people were hospitalised because of medication side-effects alone. In 1991 in the US, 72,000 people were killed due to iatrogenic – that is doctor-induced – causes whilst 24,073 died of victims of firearms shootings, which makes doctors nearly three times more lethal than guns! This has serious implications for other countries including Britain because the US are the foremost pioneers in the health care field and what occurs in health care in the US is usually implemented in Britain a decade later. The drugs industry has managed to sell to the majority of the world the idea that disease is largely an inevitable part of life, especially during the later years. Through its front-line representatives – the medical system – it has effectively reduced the range of choices of health care to which the public has access. Through funding and educational control it has seen to it that natural forms of treatment are largely ignored and grossly under-researched. Those organisations which do reveal the true causes of disease and promote effective forms of disease prevention, such as nutritional medicine, healing and naturopathy are regularly attacked in the mass media and publicly labelled as quacks by pharmaceutically-sponsored de-bunking organisations such as the Campaign Against Health Fraud, now called Healthwatch. They have also sold to us the idea that natural remedies and cures which have been successfully employed for centuries are 'alternatives' and to be treated with great scepticism and caution. Frequently, we are told of how one or two people have been injured or killed through the misapplication of a herbal remedy by dubious alternative practitioners but are not told at the same time of the thousands who are damaged by the conventional drugs which are handed out like sweets by our doctors. During their initiation into the Western medical tradition most of our young doctors are repeatedly informed by their superiors that therapies which are alternative to classic western medicine are fraudulent and quackish. They are told that there is no scientific evidence to support any of the claims of psychic healing, crystal therapy, colour therapy and the like and the whole area is dismissed with a superior grin and a wave of the hand. A mountain of study is then hurled at the junior doctors, on top of an already inhumane workload of practical hours, to be spent absorbing the biased views of their forebears. A junior doctor has not even enough time to explore the realms of stress-free relaxation never mind alternative thought and therapies. Much the same methods are used by certain religious organisations to indoctrinate the minds of their followers into a single belief system. The key tactics, to which most doctors will relate, are: maintenance of sleep deprivation so as to minimise resistance to teachings, isolation from the outside world until one is literally eating, breathing and sleeping the set doctrine of the cult, and maintenance of a fear of failure to conform through almost unachievably high level goal setting; often via frequent examinations."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"I believe that western medicine is as much a dogmatic cult as popular Christianity or the Moonies. It breeds its young on dogma to the exclusion of free will and reasoned thought in order to perpetuate itself. It is controlled by instilling into its members the fear of failure and it thrives by exploiting the initial motivation of its members, which is love and a desire to help and heal others. At the apex of the pyramid of medicine lie the controllers; not doctors, but the multinational pharmaceutical companies who exist, not for the benefit of others, but for the desire for money and power. And behind them lies the sinister organisation of global secret societies headed by the Illuminati. It is through this subtle mind control that the System maintains itself. Veiled in secrecy and fuelled by fear, the monster machine controls every aspect of our lives. The medical system is an integral part, but nevertheless only one aspect, of the overall design which seeks power and neither cares how this power is achieved, nor how many individuals are destroyed in the process. As an example of the fraud perpetuated by the pharmaceutical companies, the next section will take a close look at the AIDS scandal, which illuminates how these companies have infiltrated every area of the healthcare system are willing to endanger people, allowing them to be killed, for profit via the industry's tool of corruption and front organisation, our own medical system: What is AIDS? AIDS is defined as any one of twenty five unrelated diseases plus a positive test for the presence of antibodies to the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV). It is said to be transferred through intimate sexual contact via the transfer of bodily fluids such as semen and blood. It is also said to be passed on through intravenous means by needle-sharing drug users and infected blood transfusions. Nearly five hundred scientists world-wide, including eminent doctors such as leading University of California Professor of Molecular Biology, Peter Duesberg, and Australian biophysicist Eleni Papadopoulous-Eleopoulos, Dr Charles Thomas (former Harvard Professor of Biochemistry), Dr Kary Mullis (1993 Nobel Prize-winner for Chemistry), Dr Hank Loman (Professor of Biophysical Chemistry, Free University of Amsterdam), and Dr Steven Lomas (Professor of Preventative Medicine, State University of New York) are now convinced that AIDS is not caused by HIV. In simple terms, the facts just do not add up. For example, there are many people with AIDS but without HIV and vast numbers of people who are HIV positive are not developing AIDS. The tests for the presence of retrovirus HIV – the Western Blot Test and the ELISA Test – which show up HIV positive status, are so inaccurate that false positive tests can occur due to many diseases such as malnutrition, multiple infections, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, leprosy, having once had the 'flu' or measles and the bodies natural response to anal semen. Once diagnosed as HIV positive, patients are given regular blood tests to monitor their immunological responses, particularly for a drop in T-cell count. T-cells are released in the immune response to disease to attack invading antigens. A significant T-cell drop, in many clinics, is the indicator that active drug therapy should be commenced. However, using T-cell counts as an indicator of disease is entirely useless as the average T-cell count for a healthy person can range from 200 to 2000 over the course of a normal day. Professor Ian Weller, who co-ordinated the British arm of the Concorde AZT trial testing the drug on healthy HIV-positive volunteers, commented: 'The thing we have to remember about CD4 (T-cell) counts is they are very variable. They can vary in an individual over the time of day... lower in the morning and higher in the evening. They can be affected by things that you do such as walking to the clinic, as opposed to riding a bike... the amount of sunshine can affect them. Smoking as well.' This whole area of inaccurate testing in the area of AIDS and AIDS Related Conditions (ARC) has"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"accounted for many people being incorrectly diagnosed as HIV positive, such as in Africa where there is a supposed epidemic; there is also a massive amount of otherwise unrelated disease there too and it is this factor which is causing the false positives. Once diagnosed, patients are then initiated onto courses of highly toxic drugs such as AZT, DDI and Septrin, many of the side effects of which are the self same symptoms as those of AIDS. None of these AIDS defining diseases are new. What is new, however, is the HIV test. All research into this syndrome has been based upon the findings of Robert Gallo, the co-founder and patent holder of the test, which have since been found to be fraudulent. Gallo's partner and co-founder of the HIV theory, Luc Montagnier, declared in 1989: 'HIV is not capable of causing the destruction to the immune system which is seen in people with AIDS'. One medical doctor who has practised and lectured on medicine world-wide for over thirty five years, Dr. Robert E. Wilner has even publicly demonstrated that HIV does not cause disease by injecting himself with the blood of an HIV positive patient on Spain's most popular television show; yet this never made it to the press outside of Spain! In his book 'Deadly Deception: The Proof That Sex And HIV Absolutely Do Not Cause AIDS' , Dr. Wilner cites AZT as one of the major causes of AIDS, he also insists that 'HIV is simply a harmless piece of tissue, not unlike numerous other retroviruses that exist in our body' and that 'AIDS is not transmitted sexually nor is it contagious by any method!' Dr Duesberg, recognised as one of, if not the foremost retrovirus expert in the world, points out: 'AZT is A Random Killer Of Infected And Non-Infected Cells. AZT cannot discriminate among them. It kills T-cells, B-cells, red cells, it kills all cells. AZT is a chain terminator of DNA synthesis of all cells – no exceptions. It wipes out everything. In the long run it can only lead to death of the organism – and the cemetery. AZT is a certain killer! Who will be responsible for the death of patients (some 200,000 now being treated with AZT and countless thousands who have already died from it in the past decade) that results from AZT therapy – pharmacological homicide?' And furthermore, that: 'HIV does not cause AIDS... The point that everyone is missing is that all of those original papers, Gallo wrote on HIV have been found fraudulent... The HIV hypothesis was based on those papers.' It is my opinion that these scientists are correct and that HIV is not the cause of AIDS. AIDS is not a single viral disease but a collection of, in part, unrelated diseases which are caused by disharmonious energies in the fields of the holistic body, brought about by all sorts of reasons. Undoubtedly one of the major causes of death by AIDS-related diseases is the inability of the body to fight off the manifested disease because the body has been weakened by the very drugs given to suppress the disease. Tests have shown that the only effective treatments for AIDS are those which involve the cessation of conventional drugs in favour of unconventional natural therapies such as Essiac, Oxygen/Ozone Therapy and CanCell. However, these natural therapies share a common theme in that they have all been suppressed or withdrawn by governmental agencies and those with vested interests in the pharmaceutical industry. (To further support the fact that HIV is not transferred sexually, Cathy O'Brien in her book Trance Formation Of America , points out that, despite being prostituted to men in areas supposedly rife with AIDS, none of her political abusers ever wore protection during sex with her.)"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Wellcome to Hell Wellcome (Wellcome Burroughs in the US) began as a pharmaceutical company set up in 1880 by Henry Wellcome and Silas Burroughs. Its links to the Rockefeller Empire were apparent in Henry Wellcome's appointing of John and Allen Dulles of the Sullivan and Cromwell law firm as those responsible for any legal matters relating to the company and his own will. With Henry Wellcome's death in 1936, the Wellcome Trust was set up in conjunction with the company (now the Wellcome Foundation) and this has now become one of the largest funders of medical research in Europe. The Rockefeller connection was also strengthened in the late 50's when Wellcome took over the running of aspects of the Rockefeller funded London University College Hospital Medical School and their joint interests in tropical illness research via the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Over the following decades, Wellcome pursued several aspects of pharmaceutical healthcare with interests in general over-the-counter remedies, anti-virals, animal healthcare, genetic engineering and biotechnology. It strengthened its connections within the government, the media, medical academia and the various committees, societies and associations that were continuously being set up to review, regulate and control all aspects of scientific medical research and education. It did this by making donations to many of these organisations, such as the British Association for the Advancement of Science, the Parliamentary Science and Technology Foundation, the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, and the British Medical Association's Foundation for AIDS (to which it gave £144,000 between 1988 and 1992), and by placing its own trustees, researchers and 'experts' in prominent positions within them. For example: Sir Alastair Pilkington one time vice president of the Foundation for Science and Technology was a research scientist for Wellcome; Professor C. Gordon Smith, Dean of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine was a Wellcome trustee; Lord Swann, Director of the BBC in the 1980's was a Wellcome trustee; Sir Alfred Shepperd, a member of the Advisory Council on Science and Technology(ACST) was Chairman of Burroughs Wellcome and the Wellcome Foundation until 1985; Professor Roy Anderson, Head of Pure and Applied Biology at London Imperial College of Science, Technology and medicine and a member of ACST was also a Wellcome trustee. In the 1980's however, the company went through some major rationalisations. In 1986 the decision was made to sell shares in the Welcome drug company which had previously been owned in its entirety by the Wellcome Trust. In the following six years it also sold off several areas of business including Cooper Animal Healthcare – a joint venture with ICI producing organo-phosphate sheep dip – and its interests in vaccine production. Production of general cough and cold remedies was also reduced to a mere 14% of sales while it began concentrating its funds in the more profitable areas of genetics, biotechnology and anti-virals. AZT, marketed by Wellcome as Retrovir, had been developed in the 60s as a drug to treat cancer but it had proved to be highly toxic as well as ineffective as it appeared unable to distinguish between cancerous and healthy cells. However, tests in vitro appeared to show some anti-viral properties which was why, after being shelved in the 60s, AZT was re-tested for use in the treatment of AIDS in the 1980s. Human clinical drug trials, following extensive (though useless) animal testing, usually take place in two parts. Phase I tests for toxicity; Phase II concentrates on the long-term side-effects and efficacy, all of which can take several years. In the case of AZT the Phase II trials in America were halted after 4 months when only 1 of the AZT users as opposed to 19 of the control group had died and the drug was granted a license despite the fact that the patients in the trial were given regular blood transfusions to alleviate the possible side-effects (this should, under usual circumstances, have negated the results of the trial). This licensing of AZT so quickly was unprecedented and made Wellcome's profits double to £1132 million in the space of 4 years! As if this wasn't enough, subsequent licenses for other AIDS drugs were issued subject to the condition that they would have to be tested against AZT and then only prescribed in conjunction with it."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Incredibly, AZT was licensed in the UK without any clinical trials four weeks before it was licensed in the US. This, perhaps, may have been due to the fact that, of the 25 members of the Medicines Commission who are parliamentary advisers on medicine, 5 had interests in Wellcome; one prominent member being Professor Trevor M. Jones, Director of Research and Development at Wellcome. And of the 21 members of the Committee on the Safety of Medicines who grant the licenses, two had interests in the Welcome Foundation. Within a short space of time, AZT was licensed in 35 countries around the world and Wellcome were promoting it with media advertising, press releases and all-expenses-paid conferences to which they regularly invited the world's top scientists and physicians, all the while denying any suggestions that it caused harmful side-effects. Wellcome's influence on the media and the government continued with its donation of £10,000 to the All Party Parliamentary Group on AIDS (APOGA) as, with the Medical Research Council, Wellcome began the trials of AZT on asymptomatic HIV positive patients – the Concorde trials – in October 1988. From that point onwards most of the doctors presenting information and writing for APGOA were also involved in these trials. Not content with promoting their own research in the area of AIDS they also began to attack any alternative treatments or anyone who challenged the HIV=AIDS hypothesis. Wellcome had also cornered the British market in AIDS testing kits. With the help of Dr. Robin Weiss and Angus Dalgleish from the Institute of Cancer Research, a second generation kit was marketed based on the research by Campaign Against Health Fraud (now Healthwatch) member, Professor Vincent Marks, head of the Biochemistry Department of Surrey University – a department which has received over half a million pounds from Wellcome since 1985. In order to ensure that anyone found to be HIV positive was immediately directed towards 'help' from AZT-promoting doctors, GP's were given very limited access to the testing kits. They had no choice but to send their patients to Wellcome-infiltrated teaching hospitals and STD clinics in London while the promotion and sale of home testing kits was banned in the UK (in 1992), thereby ensuring Wellcome's complete monopoly in all aspects of AIDS treatment and diagnosis. Education about HIV and AIDS could also not be overlooked and Wellcome donated substantial funds to pay for a £150,000 package for GPs, produced by the British Medical Association. The Concorde trials themselves, instead of being independent, were almost totally under Wellcome's influence. The initial reason for the trials was to prove that AZT would be effective in preventing the development of ARC and AIDS in otherwise healthy HIV+ patients. Going against all established regulations for the independence of such trials, which in the past had the drug companies supplying the drug and paying the hospitals to do the trials, the Concorde trial was set up jointly between Wellcome, the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Department of Health. The MRC paid for the treatment and the Department of Health granted the use of six London hospitals, NHS staff and facilities. Anyone with an HIV positive test was encouraged to join the trial without discussion of any alternative treatments whilst being promised up to 3 years of free healthcare despite the fact that the AZT drug was to be administered at 1000mg per day – twice the dose recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration – and the recent reports of serious side-effects such as muscle wasting, anaemia and impotence. Wellcome's crowning glory in this deal, though, was to also insist that the contract gave them complete control over the writing of any reports about the trial. The only report which had to be agreed between all parties was the one for general publication, if indeed any published report was even deemed necessary. Just to make absolutely sure of obtaining the desired outcome, Wellcome had the help of several 'friends' in the MRC who had just as many, if not more, commitments to industry and business matters than they did to the medical establishment or the government. Lord Jellicoe, Chairman of the MRC's AIDS committee, was a director of the Rockefeller company Morgan Crucible as well as the sugar company Tate and Lyle and was later chairman of Booker Tate confectionery; Sir Donald Acheson worked for the Department of Health but left in 1991 to work in the Rockefeller funded School of Hygiene and Tropical"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Medicine; Sir Austin Bide was Chief Executive of Glaxo (now in partnership with Wellcome) and had been a director of J. Lyons & Co confectionery in the 70's. Sir David Crouch, MP for Canterbury until 1987, was director of Pfizer Ltd., a pharmaceutical company which was the only manufacturer of a synthesised ingredient of AZT at that time and also ran several public relations companies one of which, Kingsway Rowland, handled Wellcome's AZT account; Dr J. W. G. Smith, director of the Public Health Laboratory Service since 1985 used to be a Senior Lecturer at the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine before going to work for Wellcome as head of Bacteriology in 1969; Professor D. A. Warrell was a director of the Wellcome Tropical Research Unit and has also done malaria research funded by Wellcome and the Rockefeller Foundation; Professor C. N. Hales is a specialist in diabetes whose research is often funded by pharmaceutical companies including Wellcome. With the above as the only 8 members of the MRC Committee on AIDS and their Chairman Lord Jellicoe, it is not surprising that a drug once deemed to be too toxic, which has never been properly tested and whose side-effects, according to the British National Formulary, bear s striking resemblance to the symptoms of AIDS itself, has been allowed to become the AIDS drug of the 90's and has kept the profits rolling in for Wellcome to the tune of an estimated £400 million a year. 'I will give no deadly medicine to any one if asked.' (from the Hippocratic Oath) Walter's position as a staff nurse at Newcastle General Hospital's Infectious Disease Unit (ward 25), which is affiliated with the London School of Tropical Medicine, has given me an insight into the world of AIDS treatment which is rarely seen and it only serves to corroborate the research of the aforementioned enlightened scientists, whose numbers are ever increasing. The world of AIDS care and treatment at the NGH has some very sinister elements and I have no reason to suspect that it is isolated to this regional unit alone. Here is an outline of some of the information which Walter has provided: According to the code of conduct provided by the United Kingdom Central Council for nursing and midwifery, the nurse's role is to be the patient's advocate and is, therefore, entrusted to provide care in the best interest of the patient and to decline from doing anything which is detrimental to their well being. One of the major areas covered by this is in the administration of drugs; the nurse is responsible for ensuring the correct dosage of drug is given and is responsible also for being aware of the effects and possible side effects of the medication. However, in the NGH unit, nurses are expected to give all drugs prescribed by the doctor whether or not any information on the effects of the drug are available. Frequently the prescribing doctor is unaware of the true nature of the drugs and thus unable to inform the nursing staff of the effects and side effects of the drugs they are using. Many and varied substances appear and disappear periodically from the drugs cupboard, often named only as a series of numbers or letters. When challenged as to the reason why they have prescribed such unknown entities, the doctors usually reply that their consultant has ordered it to be given. The consultant is usually unavailable for comment. l The side effects of the drugs have been seen to be potentially harmful. For example, one commonly used drug, Foscarnet, which is given directly into the heart or eyes of a patient, when dropped on a nurse's tights dissolved them on contact. Common side effects of this drug include epilepsy, blindness and dementia. Many patients have entered the unit with minor symptoms such as weight loss and have, in a short space of time, become blind and epileptic through using it. Walter has frequently said to me, 'I'm poisoning people for a living', but if he refused to give the drugs as prescribed he would lose his job and someone would be found who would administer them. The same is true of the junior doctors who are afraid of the vengeance from above if they were to l"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"challenge the status quo. No challenge has yet been made, even after I presented the unit with detailed papers outlining the research which has negated the 'HIV equals AIDS' myth. Once diagnosed as HIV positive, many patients are then informed that the only chance they have for extended survival is to use the drugs provided. Obviously the majority of patients, many of whom show very few symptoms, are too afraid not to co-operate with the regime. They then suffer terribly and die a lingering and undignified death. As a response to many challenges Walter has made to the medical staff to justify their drugs regime, he has been branded cynical and defeatist; as not wishing to give the patients a chance for survival. In reply to this he has asked on many occasions for the doctors to give him even just one example of anyone whom they have cured of AIDS or significantly improved the quality of life. Not one of them has been able to give such an example. Even if we were extending people lives, in doing so we also inflict upon them such diseases as makes for little or no quality of life. What is the point of an extra year of life if that year is spent as a living vegetable? If we do have a prognosis of death, then surely it is better to live that remaining life to the full with our eventual demise being as gentle and as dignified as possible. l On one occasion, the unit exceeded its drugs budget and feared a crisis in care. At this point Wellcome stepped in and offered its services for free on the condition that they would supply the drugs as long as all research notes were given directly to them in return. It appears that the only figures who were aware of anything like the full picture were the consultants in charge and the research nurse appointed by the company, none of whom were willing to reveal anything of the results of these apparently blind drugs trials. In effect, this means that the patients on this unit are being treated by the pharmaceutical scientists as human guinea pigs, in order to test the various drugs supplied. How are we to know that these drugs are genuinely safe for the purpose of therapy? Might they simply be poisons or ineffectual chemicals thrown onto the research pot in a vain attempt to happen across some element of cure? Are they even actively seeking a cure, knowing what we do of their motivation? Some of the drugs which have been identified and are in regular use have long since been discontinued in other areas of medicine because they are ineffective and/or dangerous. For example, A.Z.T. was once considered too toxic to be given to terminally ill cancer patients! Interestingly, the official patient leaflet, 'HIV and AZT, the choices', as supplied to AIDS departments by Wellcome, gives merely three examples of side effects of the drug, i.e. anaemia, which they say effects up to 40% of users; headaches in 1-10% of users; and sickness in 25% of users which: 'almost always disappear after a few weeks of treatment' . The leaflet also states: Most people do not suffer side effects when they take AZT early. If they do occur, there are ways of coping with them. They may be reversed, if necessary by stopping treatment. If you thought that you may be facing death through an incurable disease would you stop taking the drug that has been hyped as giving an extension of lifespan, I wonder? Septrin is a combination of two antibiotics and has been shown to be far less effective and far more liable to dramatic side effects than either of the components when used individually (interestingly, it is also nearly three times more expensive than the more effective and less harmful constituent ingredient Trimethorprim). l"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Even Thalidomide is now being used on Ward 25 for its anti-emetic properties. Many patients diagnosed as terminally ill have drawn up living wills in which they often request a cessation of active treatment in the end stages of disease. These are frequently ignored by the doctors who continue to pump toxins into dying patients and claim to be simply following orders from above. The point of which escapes myself and Walter and quite often the doctors themselves. l When a patient dies, relatives are officially informed that their loved ones are deemed as dangerous waste and must, therefore, be sealed and cremated for hygiene reasons. No mention is made of autopsy or further experimentation and yet Walter has witnessed conversations amongst doctors regarding autopsy findings on such people who were supposed to have gone to cremation unmolested. Is this further pharmaceutical research? l One evening, in the absence of an available doctor from the unit, Walter had to call upon a consultant from another area to advise upon a matter. Whilst this covering doctor was attending to the issue Walter made known his concerns about the dangerous amounts of drugs a patient was prescribed. This consultant agreed with Walter that it was excessive and dangerous and complied with his request to discontinue the majority of the drugs. He also admitted to Walter that there was definitely something extraordinary and far reaching going on in this area which was beyond his jurisdiction. Furthermore, if he had his way, the majority of the drugs given on the unit would never have been prescribed in the first place. However, 'see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil' seemed to be the order of the day and that was the end of the matter. l All of this information is deeply disturbing. As more and more evidence mounts against the HIV theory, it seems that the only way to survive AIDS is to steer clear of the medical profession and its terrible drugs. If it is true of this one syndrome then how true is it of other areas of disease? Just how manipulated are we by these companies? And how much wheeling and dealing is going on behind the scenes between consultants and pharmaceutical companies which directly effects our well-being? AIDS is a huge money spinner providing millions of pounds of profit per day in drugs sales and its offshoot market of condom sales (Wellcome also has links with the London Rubber Company). It has instilled a fear in the heart of our society of free sexual expression and has given rise to much bigotry from the poorly educated who see AIDS as a judgement from God or a punishment for active homosexuality. It has created a huge charity industry, netting millions of pounds from the world population to fund further research to rid the world of this affliction. And how much misery and negativity has it generated? Further research means more experiments on both animals and humans. And the figures for economic growth just rise and rise. Truth – A Cure For All Disease As another example of the medical conspiracy; would it shock you to find out that there are, in use today, several medically proven cures for cancer? One such cure is Essiac and has been in use since at least 1922; it has no known adverse side effects. It is made from four common herbs and elevates the immune system. In 1937 it came within three votes of being legalised as a cancer treatment in Canada and was passed on to the British Cancer Campaign by its founder, Rene Caisse, via the Prince of Wales. And yet today, it is still only available through selected, virtually underground, outlets world-wide. I have many dozens of case studies which testify to the efficacy of this treatment (see Appendix IV). Furthermore, in the 1930s a man named Royal Raymond Rife developed a very high powered microscope,"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"almost seven times more powerful than those in use at the time, which could detect organisms which cause diseases such as infections and cancers. He did this by illuminating these organisms at their own specific frequency of light and could, therefore, examine them and their effects whilst they remained alive as opposed to killing them first using dye stains or high powered electron microscopy as was the norm. He then discovered that, by altering the frequency of their environment microbes could mutate and change their size and shape to resemble viruses and bacteria alike, thereby enabling the same microbe to cause many diverse diseases. For example, the same germs which cause pus – streptococci – could also become the germs which cause pneumonia – pneumococci – in response to an alteration in their environment. Rife also discovered that by bombarding these organisms with higher frequencies of light, he could destroy them. He demonstrated that it was possible to create and destroy cancers at will and succeeded in curing otherwise terminal patients of this disease, as well as others such as polio and typhus, in almost 100% of cases. Today, it is conventionally accepted that single specific germs are responsible for single specific forms of infection. This theory was advanced by the French scientist Pasteur but was disputed by his rival Bechamp who was in favour of the mutation theory known as pleomorphism. We are rarely informed in text books that, according to his co-worker, Dr Duclaux, Pasteur himself changed his mind and revoked his 'germ theory' in favour of one closer to that of pleomorphism. However, over 100 years later, Pasteur's original germ theory is still the standard working model for the understanding of the action of microbes in the body. Many types of bacteria exist in a symbiotic relationship with our bodies all of the time and only become symptomatic once the physical body begins to deteriorate due to an unhealthy lifestyle. Bacteria are then free to scavenge the 'soil' produced in the disease process, i.e. when the tissues degenerate to a similar frequency as the microbes, releasing dead organic matter similar to viruses upon which these microbes feed (remember Wilner's definition of the HIV retrovirus?). They then excrete this dead matter as waste products via the bloodstream, faeces or other exudates such as mucous. The extent to which the bacteria can multiply is limited to the amount of soil upon which they have to feed and could not be capable of invading the body to the extent to which science would have us believe unless there was already an adequate food supply. Furthermore, as has been demonstrated in Rife's vibratory work, it is possible for these microbes to mutate into other forms and even to cancer-causing agents according to their environmental conditions, defined by the degree of concentration of waste products and the vibratory rate. The subsequent systemic and metabolic reaction to these toxic excreted waste products, such as sore throat and high temperature (the body's natural way of eradicating the bacteria), are generally the symptoms of diseases which are given priority in day to day general medical practice, whereupon drugs are usually given to suppress them. In giving antibiotics we often succeed in killing the very microbes which are removing the diseased body's dead matter during the natural healing process. In doing so we also open up our bodies to other forms of disease such as fungal infections which are usually kept at bay by the natural presence of bacteria. Another effective cure for AIDS and cancer has been successfully employed in clinical practise all over the world for at least fifty years and is a cure for virtually all germ diseases. This is Oxygen/Ozone therapy. The principle behind it is simplicity itself and is the reason why the pharmaceutical companies and drug agencies are so afraid of it that they have conspired to suppress it also. It is conventionally accepted that the majority of germs are anaerobic, which means that they survive without oxygen. Therefore, if one floods the bloodstream with oxygen, these organisms cannot survive. Oxygen is one of the fundamental and most necessary elements to human survival. It exists as air, water and most of our food sources such as carbohydrates. The human race has evolved in levels of oxygen far higher than exist in today's polluted and tree-depleted world and we are all running on less than is desirable for optimum health; especially the city-dwellers. Foods and food supplements which release high levels of oxygen such as in the form of Hydrogen Peroxide are beneficial to our well-being. Indeed, Hydrogen Peroxide itself, when taken in dilute form or applied directly to wounds is one of the most effective antiseptics and healing"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"compounds there is. I believe disease is the result of disharmonious energy fields which can be caused by both physical and non-physical disharmony. Thus, dis-ease can be eradicated by oxygen therapy because it boosts the immune system by raising our vibratory rate, thereby making our bodies healthy. It is a simple fact that disease cannot exist in a healthy body . According to the testimonies of international MD's assembled at the May 1983 Sixth World Ozone (a concentrated form of Oxygen Therapy) Conference in Washington, D.C.: Ozone eliminates... viruses and bacteria from blood, human and stored... Medical ozone is successfully used on AIDS, Herpes, Hepatitis, Mononucleosis, Cirrhosis of the liver, Gangrene, Cardiovascular Disease, Arteriosclerosis, High Cholesterol, Cancerous Tumours, Lymphomas, Leukaemia... Highly effective on Rheumatoid and other Arthritis, Allergies of all types... Improves Multiple Sclerosis, ameliorate Alzheimer's Disease, Senility and Parkinson's... Effective on Proctitis, Colitis, Prostate, Candidiasis, Trichomoniasis, Cystitis; Externally, ozone is effective in treating Acne, burns, leg ulcers, open sores and wounds, Eczema and fungus. In 1976, the US FDA hindered the progress of this form of therapy by stating: Ozone is a toxic gas with no known medical uses . And yet, one doctor using ozone in his work with colonic cancer patients, Dr Hans Neiper, from Hanover, despite refusing to divulge the names of his cancer patients, stated in 1987: 'President Reagan is a very nice man.' And, 'You wouldn't believe how many FDA officials or relatives or acquaintances of FDA officials come to see me in Hanover. You wouldn't believe this, or directors of the American Medical Association (AMA), or American Cancer Association, or the residents of orthodox cancer institutes. That's the fact.' Oxygen/Ozone therapy researcher and ambassador, Ed McCabe states: Let's compare medical ozone therapy with prescription drugs. In 1978 the FDA reported 1.5 million were hospitalised in the USA due to the side-effects of medication. On the other hand, medical ozone has been legally used in clinics world-wide on a daily basis since the forties, and in Germany 644 ozone therapists were surveyed, and they reported 384,775 patients had received 5,579,238 ozone treatments. The side-effect rate was only 0.0007% during 5.5 million dosages! Yet, each year approximately 140,000 people in the US die from prescription drug usage. To this day researchers maintain that the exact causes of and cures for cancer are unknown whilst many others who claim that they do know are frequently the victims of a conspiracy of suppression by governmental agencies and corporate business interests. It is vital that we understand the true nature of disease if we are to be effective in its eradication. It is imperative that we use the total sum of our knowledge to combat disease and work together as a multi-disciplinarian society, not in isolated, self-interested units. We must open our eyes to the realities and seek the best of conventional and unconventional medicine. We must concentrate on why we are ill and not simply seek to eradicate symptoms of disorders which we often see as inevitable. Disease is not our natural state, it is not inevitable. It is an outward physical display of disharmony whose cause is far more significant than its symptoms. The responsibility for health lies with all of us, not only with doctors or governments. How many millions flock to the doctor and expect some treatment for a symptom, caring not for the cause but seeking only the relief of discomfort? And who is to blame them? They are victims of the pharmaceutical conspiracy too. According to these scientists, and medical practitioners who find"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"employment within the System, there is little evidence to give credence to any form of medicine other than their own. Or so they and we are told. They seem deaf to the testimonies of the healers and the healed who stand before them as living proof of the power of mind over matter, homeopathy and herbalism etc. It is healthy to be sceptical but there is a danger of sceptic thought becoming septic thought if it fails to reason with an open mind and allow for progress. Any doctor who fails to open their mind to the information such as is presented in this book is missing the opportunity to fulfil their true role as healers of the sick. There is without doubt a conspiracy of wilful ignorance amongst the cult of western medicine, as even scientifically verified proof of the healing power of channelled energy has been ignored by the majority of practitioners. One smoke-screen which is constantly employed by the major drug companies is the regular promise that they are 'currently working on a new form of treatment which could soon revolutionise the treatment of...'. Such stories are picked up by the press and t.v science programmes with great fervour. They are nearly always described in terms of 'miracle cure' and point out that adequate funding is necessary for the fulfilment of the prophecy in another 2 or 3 years time. However, when 2 or 3 years time finally arrives we have all conveniently forgotten about the promised miracle drug whilst anxiously awaiting the fulfilment of yet further promises of drugs which are 'hoped' will one day prove to be the end of yet another terrible disease. And this is the industry which denigrates the field of natural health for taking advantage of the sick and for so cruelly promising fake cures and providing false hope! The obvious lesson here is that to disguise your own sins you must accuse your enemies of them and to always do it before your enemy has a chance to formulate their defence. Mud usually sticks to the one it first lands upon. This a political trick which has been used to devastating effect by the key manipulators of this century in all areas and has been used to shift public opinion in favour of some of the greatest atrocities ever committed. The Elite via chemo-pharmaceutical companies and food and water production services penetrate all areas of health care and use it to promote and execute their policies of population control, mind control and 'divide and rule', whilst making vast sums of money into the bargain. Vivisection – far more than an animal rights issue! This section is intended to be read in order that the sinister implications of animal experiments upon the whole of mankind are thoroughly understood. I am aware, from personal experience of street campaigning for animal rights issues, that many people who care passionately about animals find it simply too distressing to see or read any form of evidence to this effect. Consequently, I have chosen not to give practical details about individual animal experiments in the coming discourse Instead I will focus upon the scientific fraud perpetrated by vivisectors and how their warped ethos that vivisection is a valuable scientific tool has corrupted the progress of medicine and upset the delicate balance of the minds of millions world-wide. I seek to show how vivisection is an integral part of the manipulation of society (the vivisectors themselves being amongst the most completely manipulated of all) by the very same consciousness and indeed the very same people I have already discussed. Nothing is worse than vivisection! No other single factor causes more pain, distress and death to humans and animals. Nor is there any less scientific or ethical method of research currently being employed in industry or educational establishments anywhere in the world. Unless you have read the books and seen the video footage which I and thousands of other anti-vivisection campaigners have been required to endure, nothing in your imagination can paint for you anything like the true picture of the hell of animal experiments. In fact, if you can conjure up the most heinous spectacle of"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"abuse within your mind, be assured that this is precisely what is being done today, but probably much worse, around the world in schools, universities and research labs owned by private companies – and then some. It is being done with our money, and in order to provide huge mega-wealthy pharmaceutical companies with staggering profit and as an excuse to provide jobs for vivisectors. It is also perpetuated to ensure that mankind never becomes learned about the true nature, cause and cure of disease. Two thousand animals per minute die as a result of gruesome experiments; that is 250 million per year; approximately 3.5 million per year in Great Britain alone. Over 75% of these experiments are done without anaesthetics, and when they are, they are often inadequately applied. Most experiments are done with public money. 0.2% of the animals used are for the testing of cosmetics. In Britain there are merely 19 Home Office inspectors to cover 20,000 licensed vivisectors. The practise of animal experimentation has been the mainstay of medical and biological research since the early 1800s even though it has brought about not one major breakthrough in medical science. And yet, every medical student, in order to pass his or her exam and advance in their chosen career must quote the results of animal experiments. How can respect for life, compassion and empathy be taught to and nurtured in our doctors through a practise which necessitates the ignorance of pain, suffering, anxiety terror and death, as is the case with the training process of US doctors who regularly dissect live animals as part of their training? The answer is simple: It can't. The animal experimenters are the cornerstone of the highly corrupt and manipulative pharmaceutical industry. These are a pseudo-scientific fraternity who earn vast amounts of money for their employers by performing unbelievably barbaric experiments which can be used to (falsely) substantiate claims that their drugs are safe for human use. Dr. James D. Gallagher, Director of Research of Lederle Laboratories in the Journal of the American Medical Association, March 14, 1964 stated: 'Animal studies are done for legal reasons and not for scientific reasons. The predictive value for such studies for man is meaningless – which means our research may be meaningless.' There is no British or European law which states that new drugs, chemicals or cosmetics must be tested on animals. However, animal testing ensures that vivisectors get the results they want in order to sell their dangerous chemicals to an unwary public. In numerous legal trials of drug companies who have caused fatalities and injuries, the most effective defence which has been used time and again is that: 'All of the usual and required testing had been done to establish the safety of the drug in question' . A standpoint which most legal authorities are not qualified to dispute. Indeed, the 'experts' upon whom they call for advice in such matters are invariably members of other drug companies or drug sponsored agencies and therefore the animal testing fraternity. Animal experiments have been cited in many court battles over drugs damages claims and have been used both to defend the idea that such disasters were unforeseen because adequate testing had been employed, but have also been successfully used, as in the Thalidomide case in December 1970, to admonish the drug company (in this case Chemie Grunenthal) who testified that animal tests could never be conclusive for humans. The very idea that a test or operation done on an animal will show results which are directly translatable to humans is plainly ridiculous. As has been stated by some of the greatest and most influential physicians in medical history: the anatomy, physiology and psychology of animals is entirely different to our own in many ways, and this difference is further exaggerated in the case of animals bred for and/or housed in laboratories. This can be plainly illustrated in many ways; here are just a few: The LD 50 (Lethal Dose 50%) test, which is the standard toxicity technique used to establish how much of a chemical toxin is required to kill half of a number of animals. These animals are specifically bred to be exactly identical in every way, i.e. genetically and physically they are the l"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"same size and weight. And yet, an equivalent dose of a toxin, in equal quantity and strength will succeed in killing merely half of the batch whilst leaving half to suffer varying degrees of disablement. These results are then haphazardly translated to give the figure for safe and fatal levels for humans. There are 12 different methods which determine statistically the safety of chemicals for humans from animal experiments. These may disagree by up to a factor of four. It is accepted that animal tests are successful in identifying cancer-causing agents in only 37% of cases. This means, in effect, that the results of the tests are more times wrong than right and are significantly statistically worse than tossing a coin. l As stated by Hans Ruesch in The Naked Empress or the Great Medical Fraud : 'Two grams of scopolamine kill a human being, but dogs and cats can stand hundred times higher dosages. A single Aminata phalloides mushroom can wipe out a whole human family, but is health food for the rabbit, one of the favourite laboratory animals. A porcupine can eat one lump without discomfort as much opium as a human addict smokes in two weeks, and wash it down with as much prussic acid to poison a regiment of soldiers. The sheep can swallow enormous quantities of arsenic, once the murderer's favourite poison. Morphine, which calms and anaesthetises man, causes maniacal excitement in cats and mice. On the other hand our sweet almond can kill foxes, our common parsley is poisonous to parrots, and our revered penicillin strikes another favourite laboratory animal dead – the guinea pig.' l It is fortunate for many that penicillin was never tested on guinea pigs at the outset where it would have immediately been discarded as dangerous. And if you want to prove that vitamin C is useless, withhold it from the diet of dogs – which produce vitamin C in the gut. Moreover, the whole discipline of surgery and post surgical recovery was hindered for hundreds of years after the Greek Galen (Second Century AD) showed through animal experimentation that the principle laid down by Hippocrates (Fifth century BC) was incorrect – that hygiene and a good diet (as well as establishing the simple fact that nature heals) was essential to good health and medicine. Galen maintained this standpoint, which seems bizarre by today's standards, because animals did not readily succumb to infections following childbirth and surgical procedures. Galen's animal experiments caused a rejection of Hippocratic values and a reduction in surgical asepsis. This destructive attitude was supported by the Catholic Church and was only substantially reversed in the 1800s following the discovery of the germ and how cleanliness and sterilisation could prevent bacterial infection. The following is a list of drugs which were passed as safe for human consumption on the back of animal tests and the damage which they subsequently caused: Eraldin (for heart disease) – Corneal damage including blindness. l Paracetamol (painkiller) – 1,500 people had to be hospitalised in Great Britain in 1971. l Orabilex – caused kidney damages with fatal outcome. l MEL/29 (anti-hypertensive) – caused cataracts. l Methaqualone (hypnotic) – caused severe psychic disturbances leading to at least 366 deaths, mainly through murder or suicide. l Thalidomide (tranquilliser) – caused 10,000 malformed children. l Isoproterenol (asthma) – caused 3,500 deaths in the sixties. l Stilboestrol (prostate cancer) – caused cancer in young women. l Trilergan (anti-allergic) – caused viral hepatitis. l Flamamil (rheumatism) – caused loss of consciousness. l Phenformin (diabetes) – caused 1,000 deaths annually until withdrawn. l Atromid S (cholesterol) – caused deaths from cancer, liver, gallbladder and intestinal disease. l"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Valium (tranquilliser) – addictive in moderate doses. l Preludin & Maxiton (diet pills) – caused serious damage to the heart and the nervous system. l Nembutal (insomnia) – caused insomnia. l Pronap & Plaxin (tranquilliser) – killed many babies. l Phenacetin (painkiller) – caused severe damages to kidneys and red blood corpuscles. l Amydopyrine (painkiller) – caused blood disease. l Marzine (nausea) – damaged children. l Reserpine (anti-hypertensive) – increased risks of cancer of the brain, pancreas, uterus, ovaries, skin and women's breasts. l Methotrexate (leukaemia) – caused intestinal haemorrhage, severe anaemia and rumours. l Urethane (leukaemia) – caused cancer of liver, lungs and bone marrow. l Mitotane (leukaemia) – caused kidney damage. l Cyclophosphamide (cancer) – caused liver and lung damage. l Isoniazid (tuberculosis) – caused liver destruction. l Kanamycin (tuberculosis) – caused deafness and kidney destruction. l Chloromycetin (typhoid) – caused leukaemia, cardiovascular collapse and death. l Phenolphthalein (laxative) – caused kidney damage, delirium and death. l Clioquinol (diarrhoea) – caused blindness, paralysis and death. l DES (prevent miscarriage) – caused birth defects and cancer. l Debendox (nausea) – caused birth defects. l Accutane (acne) – caused deafness and kidney destruction. l (Taken from Vivisection: Science or Sham by Dr. Roy Kupsinel, and Naked Empress by Hans Ruesch) Vivisectors often claim credit for many advances in medicine which have been brought about by non-vivisection methods. Frequently, they will quote animal experiments which show the same results without also disclosing the pioneering previous non-animal discovery. One example of this is the case of vaccinations. Whilst it is certainly true that many diseases which have decimated mankind for centuries, such as polio, smallpox, whooping cough, tuberculosis, diphtheria and tetanus have seen a dramatic decline over the last century or so, it is not because of the introduction of vaccinations. Figures show that such diseases were long in decline before the introduction of vaccinations and that the rate of fall was severely impeded once they were introduced. Advances in hygiene, sanitation, nutrition and wealth status are the obvious reasons for the improvement of the world's health overall. Vaccinations are responsible for causing many of the diseases they are supposed to cure as well as compromising the immune systems of the vulnerable, especially babies who are statistically more likely to suffer Sudden Infant Death Syndrome within weeks of having their initial standard vaccinations. The vivisectionists are master manipulators. They invest huge amounts of money in massive PR organisations such as the Research Defence Society in the UK. Furthermore, they have infiltrated many areas of the Anti-Vivisection (AV) movement and have created much confusion in the minds of the public as to the truth behind this barbaric trade in misery. An example of this was highlighted in possibly the greatest expose of vivisection industry ever written, The Slaughter of the Innocent by Hans Ruesch: An interesting case was the Animal Protection league of Basel. Its president, Dr Rudolph Schenkel, professor of ethology, criticised the revival of antivivisectionist feeling in Switzerland. Thereafter, the establishment press could write that 'even the animal defenders disapprove of the antivivisectionists' views.' A closer look at Schenkel revealed that:"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"His league had received a donation of 200,000 Swiss francs (about $100,000) from Hoffman-La Roche, 'for its animal shelter' – with no questions asked. 1. His own wife was experimenting on animals in the endocrinology department of Ceiba-Geigy. 2. When my CIVIS organisation brought about these facts, Schenkel dropped all pretence of being an animal protectionist: at the next convention of Swiss animal protection groups (SPCAs), he argued that 'since laboratory animals are a product of human enterprise, we can do with them as we please.' (My highlight added.) (This infiltration tactic is not solely within the realms of the AV movement but is widespread throughout the animal rights movement. This is exemplified at present by the large scale enrolment of blood-sports practitioners [fox and stag hunters etc.] with the RSPCA whereby they are steadily creating a significant policy influencing force by taking advantage of the apathy of many members who do not turn out to vote upon Society matters. The RSPCA also has financial investments in companies that support vivisection.) The smoke-screen perpetuated by vivisectors that it is preferable to test drugs on animals than on humans, and the emotive stance that 'it's your child or an animal', is probably the most effective way that they ensure public support for their industry. What they always fail to say is that all drugs are tested on humans immediately after the animal trials and often without the patient's knowledge or consent. Those that are informed of the trial are usually reassured to know that 'animal studies have shown the drug to be safe'. AV supporters are simply people who have come to realise the truth about this situation and have committed themselves to being a part of the process of change and reformation to abolish this massive and system of cruel fraud, both for the sake of the animals and humans. However, they are usually portrayed in the media as extremists; an inevitable side-effect of a necessary evil. Ordinary people who are deemed responsible enough to bear and raise children, minister to the sick, save lives, handle the nation's wealth, run for political seats etc., once they have made an AV stance, are immediately demoted to, at best 'irrational' and 'oversensitive', or, at worst, 'people-hating terrorists' with no right to express an opinion about such matters. Once branded as such they are given about as much regard as are the animals in the laboratory cages and are made largely impotent on the political scene because MPs do not consider it a wise career move or vote winner to consort with anyone considered to be extremist. In the case of vivisection, the public is all too willing to accept that it is a necessary part of modern progress and not really cruel at all. One reason for this is because the alternative, i.e. the truth, is almost too great a burden to accept. Such a stance is often taken in defence of one's own sanity as a mental survival technique in order that one does not go mad with the anger, sorrow, frustration and terrible empathy which the idea of vivisection evokes in us. Therefore, the vivisectors have yet another advantage over the masses in the battle to keep them convinced of the verity of their cause, whilst the AV organisations have to face a perpetual uphill struggle against the tide of wealth, mind control, tradition and human apathy which is forever on the side of the manipulators. As George Bernard Shaw once stated, 'Whoever doesn't hesitate to vivisect will hardly hesitate to lie about it' . By creating a 'healthcare' (more accurately termed 'ill-healthcare') system which relies upon the misleading results of animal experiments, the manipulators of this century have ensured that, within the system, the true causes and cures for disease will never be revealed. This in turn creates a self-perpetuating industry for the multinationals who, by creating disease via their drugs, can be assured of massive funding in order to discover a) the reason for the drug error, which is guaranteed to involve further animal studies, and b) further drugs to treat the results of the initial drug error. In the, by now, all too familiar pattern: the manipulators perpetuate the problem of a state of global ill health and therefore the need for the solution which is offered in the form of more and more pharmaceutical involvement."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"For the sake of your selves, your children and the animals: WAKE UP PEOPLE!

Jesus In 1975, a man called Dannion Brinkley was struck by lightning and had a near death experience which he recounts in his book 'Saved by the Light'. During the twenty-eight minutes while he was officially dead he was led by a spirit being through the dark tunnel to a crystal city. He was visited by thirteen beings who are described as light beings similar to classic ETs and angels. He recalls a total of 117 events showed to him on a screen which pertained to predicted events on Earth between 1975 and 2000. At the time of the release of his book in 1994, 95 of these events had occurred, including Ronald Reagan's presidency, the Gulf War, the Chenobyl disaster and the fall of the Soviet Union. Events which have not yet occurred include American bankruptcy, the development of chemical and biological weaponry to be used against France and mass destruction due to World War III. One of the final visions he was shown was computer chip technology slowly infiltrating every aspect of our day to day lives. Ultimately the controller/owner of this technology would become corrupt a see the potential for world supremacy. Eventually a computer chip would be inserted under the skin of every member of the Earth's population containing total information of everyone's medical history, social status and credit rating which could be read by a scanner and fed to a mainframe. Governments would use these chips to control the population and could also dissolve the chips to release a lethal virus in order to avoid the costs of an elderly population. Those who refused chips would be outcasts from society, unemployable and untouchable by the System's benefits. Dannion was informed by the Beings that if mankind did not deter from the projected future then these things would come to pass. If, however, action was taken now then it could all be avoided. They informed him that those who have decided to come to Earth are seen as adventurers and are the heroes and heroines who have come to co-create with God where no other spiritual beings have had the courage so to do. The parting message was that the answer lies in 'treating others the way they themselves want to be treated'. Dannion Brinkley's experience is not unique by any means. Every day people are becoming aware of our angelic hosts and are being given messages of guidance and hope for the future. I have seen such a being of light myself during astral projection and I know they exist all around us, within the higher vibrationary atmosphere of the Earth. We are being given our final warnings and opportunities to do all we can to emerge from the despair of the old dark order into the new future of light. The only way to achieve this is to recognise the pitfalls of the Luciferic influence and live our spiritual ideals in deed as well as in thought. Firstly, we have to be aware of the clues to the methods employed by the Brotherhood in their ultimate goal of centralised world control. The tools they use to fight their ultimate wars are ourselves. They program our thoughts, our very conception of who we are, what is right and wrong and we, in turn, give them what they wish in the belief that this is the right, or the only way to live long and prosper. We build the prisons in which to house ourselves and hand the keys to our gaolers who are the Brotherhood elite. The crazy part about all of this is that we do it willingly and because they ask us to. In order to facilitate the Transformation we must resist the urge to identify those who would seek to"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"control us as hopelessly 'evil'. We must recognise the System for what it is and seek to change it in a loving, positive and balanced way. Even at the highest levels of the Brotherhood elite, the most misguided of the Illuminati, are not immune from the effects of the global reawakening. It is those who are most imbalanced towards negativity who have the greatest positive potential. If just one of these elite Luciferic controlled minds is returned to its natural balanced state then virtually the entire process could be reversed over night. This is a potential, and any potential is possible. It all depends on how much energy we channel into that potential to make it a reality. Furthermore, it is essential that we take what we are being fed through the media and education with a pinch of salt for not all of it will be truth. Events are engineered on a global scale and then a version of it is transmitted to us in order to perpetuate certain states such as fear and apathy within the mass population. So much of little consequence to us is thrown our way to divert us from free thought and we are bombarded with sex, violence, sport and graphic horror. We are often more concerned with who is being transferred from which football team to another, or what the royal family had for tea than the fact that the planet is being destroyed around us and our neighbours are dying of cold, starvation and despair for the want of a little kindness and love. These are very effective diversionary tactics and manipulative devices. We must begin look at the world through new eyes if we are to really make a difference and take back the right to autonomy and free will which is ours by Divine law. This is a long term plot against humanity, a war of stealth and attrition; a war which the majority of us are not even aware exists because of its scale and slowly cumulative nature. By viewing all of these things on a large scale and by linking patterns and events which we are traditionally encouraged to see as separate, we can piece together the real agendas behind the Illuminati smoke screens. Nothing in the universe is truly separate from anything else. If we analyse just who it is in the world who benefit from the negativity and manipulation, we see that it is the same people over and over again. They represent a consciousness which is like a black hole and is sucking in our vitality with every passing day. This is the direction of the energy flow and its polarity is towards negativity. Wherever we see this trend and recognise it we can begin to work to reverse the polarity back towards the balance point. This relies on our ability to recognise Truth and be prepared to act on our knowledge. It takes you and me, and it takes love. These methods which they use to persuade us to imprison ourselves are very basic, yet awesomely effective. They engineer situations within our society up to the point where the public are so outraged that they insist on action from those in power. The powers that be (Brotherhood pawns) offer, as a solution, the very thing it wanted to impose in the first place. The public accept the proffered solution so the Brotherhood's desires are implemented with public support . For example, in order to give the police greater powers of arrest, detention and search-at-will to serve the Brotherhood, they manipulate society into creating more crime and despondency. The people cry out for a solution and the politicians come up with more government legislation to counteract the problem. What better way to gain greater control over a population than persuade its people that, for an improvement in their quality of life, they need a larger network of agencies such as MI5, CIA, FBI and the police, and with greater powers than ever before? We must always be on the alert for the hidden agendas behind legislation and economics before we subscribe to the suggested solution. Remember, these people kill or cause people to be killed for profit, pleasure and power. No one is inexpendable and most of the executors of these hidden agendas are entirely unaware or wilfully ignorant of what they are really being used for. Where we see terrorism, where we see wars, legislation against minorities to restrict their freedom, anywhere we see more powers given to the establishment and less to the free people we must ask ourselves the true reasons behind these actions. It has been shown how the bankers financed and helped to manipulate into existence the major wars of this century; how the same banks that were backing Hitler and the Nazi war machine during WWII were also behind the Allies. At the end of the war, with the world in chaos and the people's morale depleted, these same banks and their pawns, the politicians, were able to reassemble the world's economy right on target"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"for the New World Order. The future world army was initiated under the guise of a Peacekeeping force we now know as the United Nations. And the people were so grateful to these powers for ridding the world of such an evil menace that they entirely surrendered themselves, once again, to the policies and propaganda of the people who had created the war in the first place. And so, the process continues to this day. We must challenge automatic thought patterns and habitual life styles which are the weapons employed against us. We must constantly question and never betray ourselves to the power of thought-forms of the masses. The world is full of fashion victims, not only in the sense of clothing but in life-styles and thought patterns too. These fashions have been provided by, fed, watered and nurtured by the Brotherhood in order to feed their lust for money and power. Every penny we spend gets back to their banks in the end. Everything we work for and achieve will be theirs if we allow it. Moves are under way now to replace money entirely with credit. Credit cards, debit cards and smart cards are now being developed at such a runaway rate that soon we will all be rated as credit. Technology exists now to use chips in cards both for access to personal details and to transmit messages into the psyche of the carrier to control behaviour. More and more opportunities are being sought to use this micro-technology: as tags for criminals, as pet identi-chips, as surgical implants and as locators for potentially missing children and babies. It is a small step to the 'under-the-skin' control chip. Efforts are under way to centralise world government powers. Plans for a federal Europe under a single European government have been under way for years now. Step by step, power is taken away from the masses and delivered into the hands of the few. Watch out for calls for larger armies and greater powers. Have you noticed how the U.N. 'peacekeeping' forces are always too late and in too little numbers to actually be effective? Watch out for a call for a centralised world army on order to provide greater 'peacekeeping' potential, it would really be a double bluff to give more power to the Brotherhood elite. Watch out too for those situations which the ruling classes and governments vehemently oppose and be careful not to support something just because those whom you oppose are against it. This is one of the oldest, but most effective tricks in the book and it has duped millions time and time again. Don't allow the further decline or the consequences may be disastrous. Always be true to yourself first and foremost and see beneath the veil of deceit. The coming Transformation to a unified multidimensional Christ consciousness will affect everyone, the Brotherhood included. We can only be controlled if we allow ourselves to be so. Nothing is impossible. We are the vehicles for the Divine Consciousness, we are the creative hands of God. It is up to all of us, and that includes the Brotherhood, to re-evaluate our position, for we cannot escape ourselves and the karma we create. As Mark Phillips once explained to Cathy O'Brien: Good always prevails through positive application, whereas the bad guys are hindered and slowed in their criminal endeavours through having to cover-up their negative actions with lies to support lies. This inevitably allows the truth to emerge. "}]
