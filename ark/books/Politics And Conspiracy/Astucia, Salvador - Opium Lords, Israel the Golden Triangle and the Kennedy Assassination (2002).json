[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 1 INTRODUCTION Synopsis After President John F. Kennedy was killed in 1963, America became deeply involved in the Vietnam War. Within a few short yea rs, heroin addiction in America reached epidemic proportions. In the background, Is rael expanded its borders by force and became a colonial empire ruling a nation of hos tile Palestinian subjects. This book reveals how Israel exploited the Western power s’ long history of opium trafficking as a means of toppling the young Americ an president. The following points summarize the information presented: \u0001 Opium was the glue that held together the rivaling factions that conspired to kill JFK. \u0001 The main factions in the conspiracy were Zionist in stigators, the American Mafia (headed by Jewish mobster Meyer Lansky and hi s lieutenant, Santo Trafficante), French-Corsican crime syndicates in M arseilles, France and Southeast Asia, and the US military. \u0001 Heroin smuggling was first introduced to the Americ an Mafia in the 1920s by Jewish gangsters such as Meyer Lansky, \"Legs\" Diamond, and \"Dutch\" Schultz. \u0001 One of the reasons President Johnson escalated US i nvolvement in Southeast Asia was because the American Mafia and French-Cors ican heroin traffickers needed a new source of opium for their heroin facto ries. Turkey had been the main source, but its government was about to eradic ate opium production. \u0001 Joseph Kennedy, Sr’s three sons were viewed as a ne w American dynasty that threatened Israel’s plans to expand its borders. Th e Kennedy Dynasty would last until 1985 if each son served two terms in the White House. It is widely known that Joseph Kennedy Sr developed a strong loa thing of Jews from his business dealings with them in finance, Hollywood, and politics. \u0001 A decree was issued to kill JFK by Nahum Goldmann, founder of the World Jewish Congress and its president in 1963. \u0001 Louis Bloomfield of Montreal was assigned to set up the coup d’état. He was an influential international lawyer with an extensi ve espionage background (e.g., British intelligence, Haganah, OSS, CIA). \u0001 Martin Agronsky and other Jewish journalists and me dia moguls collaborated in the plot by pushing a false cover story that Lee Harvey Oswald alone killed JFK. \u0001 Right-wing extremists joined the coup initially but broke ranks and declared a holy war against Jews immediately after JFK was kil led. \u0001 The assassins were the lieutenants of French-Corsic an heroin trafficker and convicted Nazi collaborator, Auguste Joseph Ricord. He was living in Argentina at the time of the assassination. Later h e moved to Paraguay which became a major hub for smuggling heroin into the Un ited States. \u0001 The assassins were Lucien Sarti, François Chiappe, and Jean-Paul Angeletti— all French-Corsicans. \u0001 Nixon was driven from office because he destroyed R icord’s heroin cartel, established détente with the Soviet Union, withdrew forces from Vietnam, and ended the draft."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 2 \u0001 Under Nixon’s orders, police in Mexico City tried t o arrest Lucien Sarti—the man who fatally shot JFK in the head. When Sarti fl ed, Mexican police opened fire. He died in a hail of bullets on April 27, 1972. \u0001 JFK made enemies within the military establishment and Israel when he attempted to establish détente with the Soviet Unio n in the summer of 1963. He also wanted to prevent Israel from acquiring the Bomb. \u0001 JFK was viewed as a threat to Israel because of pro -Hitler statements he wrote in his 1945 diary (later published) and two books: Why England Slept and Profiles in Courage . \u0001 President Johnson aggressively supported Israel bec ause he and his wife were secretly Jewish. \u0001 Texas—a former Spanish colony—became a haven for Se phardic Jews expelled from Spain in 1492. Jewish migration conti nued from other countries in the 19 th and 20 th Centuries. Once Kennedy was out of the way, President Johnson began to shift America’s foreign policy dramatically. First of all, he incre ased military forces in South Vietnam from 16,000 non-combat advisors to over 500,000 dra ftees by the time he left office in January 1969. Secondly, he joined America and Is rael at the hip by increasing financial and military aid and becoming its ally du ring the Six Day War, an aggressive land-grab that was immediately labeled i llegal by the United Nations per Resolutions 242 and later 338. Since then, one pres ident after another has given Israel virtually everything it wants. During Kennedy’s las t year in office, in 1963, the United States provided a mere $40 million per year to Israel. Within only two years, President Johnson had increased that amount to $130 million per year, over three times Kennedy’s allowance. Most of the Johnson mone y was for military buildup. Since Kennedy’s death, the annual subsidy to Israel has grown into the billions (presently about $3 billion per year), but the John son administration marked a true turning point. 1 In fact, American aid to Israel has far exceeded t he total US payments to reconstruct postwar Europe under the Marshall Pl an. 2 The Truth About the Sixties From the day President Kennedy was killed, on Novem ber 22, 1963, until Lyndon Baines Johnson stepped down as President in January 1969, the United States government was under siege by hardened criminals, c arpetbagger politicians, war mongering generals, and ruthless friends of Israel. Their primary goals were threefold: firstly, to fill their pockets with illicit drug mo ney attained from the sale of heroin within the United States and other countries; secon dly, to prolong the Vietnam War as a means of smuggling opium from Southeast Asia for large-scale production of heroin which was ultimately smuggled back into the United States; and thirdly, to quietly support Israel’s expansion of its borders into Arab -occupied territories. These three things were the mainstay of American foreign policy throughout the 1960s. The implementers of this policy were the same forces wh o killed President Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Robert Kennedy, Malcolm X, and countless others. Ironically, the situation began to change by an unl ikely soul. He was a man hated by many for his awkward ways, his lack of charisma, ev en the way he looked and talked."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 3 He was not a handsome man or a skilled orator. He w as a streetwise man who often used vulgar language and privately expressed ethnic slurs in a seemingly bigoted manner. But despite his outward character flaws, de ep within his spiritual being this man believed strongly in God, loved his mother, his wife and children, and was extremely kind—on a personal level—to almost anyone in need. Unlike President Kennedy, this man was not born into wealth; but lik e Kennedy, his former adversary, this man had an innate understanding of right and w rong. Richard M. Nixon assumed the Presidency in January 1969. His campaign had included a war on drugs, 3 as many presidents have done since; but Nixon evid ently took his anti-drug campaign a bit farther than his successors. He went after Auguste Joseph Ricord, a French Corsican, former Nazi colla borator, and international heroin smuggler. 4 Ricord was protected by the hardened criminals, th e carpetbagger politicians, the war mongering generals, and the ru thless friends of Israel. 5 The same forces who had martyred America’s finest would stag e a bloodless coup against President Nixon for attempting to exorcise the demo ns from America’s possessed soul. 6 Nixon’s war on drugs was the impetus that led to Ri cord’s arrest in Paraguay on March 25, 1971. 7 A diplomatic tug of war ensued between Paraguay an d the United States over custody of the wily heroin kingpin. Con sequently, Ricord sat in a jail cell in Tacumbu Penitentiary in Asunción, Paraguay for a year and a half while the two governments disputed his custody. Finally in Septem ber 1972 Ricord was extradited to the United States and prosecuted for conspiracy to smuggle narcotics into America. 8 On December 16, 1972 he was convicted of that crim e, and on January 19, 1973, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison and fi ned $25,000. 9 Nixon’s pursuit of Auguste Ricord may have been par t of a broader plan to end the war in Vietnam. By breaking up the international he roin cartel, Nixon destroyed one of the main reasons for US involvement in Southeast Asia, but there were others. He also re-opened relations with China and used that a lliance as leverage to establish détente between the United States and the Soviet Union in May of 1972. 10 Nixon also increased foreign aid to Israel dramatically; he ga ve the Jewish State about $1.61 billion from 1971 through 1973. That was a huge inc rease—approximately the same amount that America had given Israel over its entir e 22 year history (from 1948 through 1970). 11 By doing this, Nixon divided his Jewish enemies. E ssentially he bought them off. Nixon further divided his enemies by pushing for a military victory in Vietnam. In December of 1972 he began a relentle ss bombing campaign of North Vietnam (known as the \"Christmas bombing\"). This ag gressive approach divided the military and was ultimately used to force North Vie tnam into serious negotiations in Paris for a peaceful solution to the war. As a resu lt, a peace agreement was soon reached. At that point Nixon withdrew American forc es from Vietnam and ended the draft. It is significant that Nixon’s visit to the Soviet Union occurred just one month before the Watergate burglary which occurred on June 17, 1 972. 12 The Soviet Union continued to exist until December 1991, but Nixon e ssentially ended the Cold War in May of 1972 when he and Soviet Premier Leonid Brezh nev signed of the SALT I (the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks) agreement."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 4 Although Nixon has been judged harshly by many, muc h about his character was revealed in his farewell address to the White House staff on August 9, 1974: ... the greatness comes not when things go always goo d for you, but the greatness comes when you are really tested, when you take some knocks, some disappointments, when sadnes s comes, because only if you have been in the deepest valley can you ever know how magnificent it is to be at the highest mou ntain. ... We want you to continue to serve in Government, i f that is your wish. Always give your best, never get discour aged, never be petty; always remember others may hate you, but those who hate you don't win unless you hate them, and then y ou destroy yourself. ... And so, we leave with high hopes, in good spirit and with deep humility, and with very much gratefulness in our he arts. I can only say to each and every one of you, we come from many faiths, we pray perhaps to different gods, but really the same God in a sense, but I want to say for each and every one of you, not only will we always remember you, not only will we alway s be grateful to you but always you will be in our hearts and you will be in our prayers. Thank you very much. (President Richard M. Nixon 13 ) The story about to be told is not merely about the death of President John F. Kennedy, it also answers many questions about President Rich ard M. Nixon, the Watergate Scandal, the Vietnam War, the Six Day War, the corr upt American news media, and the continuing Arab-Israeli conflict that ultimatel y led to terrorist attacks on America on September 11, 2001. The most troubling aspect of this book is the cynical business of opium smuggling by the Western powers, something that has been going on for nearly two centuries. In fact the West fought two O pium Wars with China in the 19 th Century to force China to import opium. ( Footnote 1 ) As a result, China developed a serious addiction problem which continued until the communists took over in 1949 and banned all narcotics. But the practice went und erground in the latter half of the 20 th Century. 14 Consequently, wealthy interests within the Western powers delegated the smuggling of narcotics to international crime s yndicates and espionage services. 15 Furthermore, heroin smuggling and prostitution were introduced in the United States in the 1920s by Jewish gangsters such as Meyer Lans ky, \"Legs\" Diamond, and \"Dutch\" Schultz. Those two enterprises had been ign ored by the Italian Mafia because of Sicilian traditions which forbade such practices . In the mid-1920s, heroin was banned in the United States. In 1930 a Mafia war br oke out regarding the illicit sale of narcotics. Over sixty gangsters were killed and a n ew generation of leaders emerged with little regard for the traditional code of hono r. The leader of the new American Mafia was the legendary Lucky Luciano who forged an alliance between the Italian Mafia and Meyer Lansky's Jewish gangs. This allianc e survived for almost 40 years"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 5 and became the dominant characteristic of organized crime in the United States in the 1960s and 70s. 16 This book demonstrates that Israel exploited Meyer Lanksy’s heroin smuggling connections in the United States and abro ad as a means of toppling President Kennedy. To some this book may seem like a painful view of r eality; to others it may seem like divine truth; still others may deny the facts compl etely. Whatever the case may be, I for one have learned that truth is indeed stranger than fiction. The Motives The primary motive behind the assassination was Ken nedy’s efforts to establish détente with the Soviet Union in the spring and sum mer of 1963; however, he was apprehensive about how American Jews and the US mil itary would react to a shift in Cold War policy. He reportedly told Soviet diplomat Andrei Gromyko that there were \"two groups of the American population which are no t always pleased when relations between our two countries are eased.\" One was \"ideo logical,\" the other \"of a particular nationality who think that, always and u nder all circumstances, the Kremlin will support the Arabs and be an enemy of Israel. T his group has effective means for making improvement between our countries very diffi cult.\" 17 In October of 1962 the United states discovered tha t the Soviet Union had been supplying Cuba with nuclear missiles. A war of nerv es ensued between the two superpowers known as the Cuban Missile Crisis . Kennedy insisted that the missiles be removed, and ultimately, he prevailed; however, he was not boastful about his victory. During the crisis the US generals wanted to attack Cuba, but Kennedy feared a US assault would escalate into nuclear war. There was a great deal of tension between Kennedy and the military at that time. In fact it i s generally accepted among scholars that one of the reasons that the nuclear stalemate ended peacefully is because both Kennedy and Khrushchev feared a military coup might arise against Kennedy if a settlement was not soon reached. 18 In the months that followed, a genuine friendship d eveloped between Kennedy and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. By the spring of 1 963, the two leaders had made great progress towards ending the Cold War, limitin g the nuclear arms race, and signing a nuclear test ban treaty. Right-wing eleme nts within the US military resisted détente for ideological reasons. 19 Israel opposed détente as well because they feared the Kremlin and Washington were more interested in Arab oil than a Jewish state located in a barren desert without natural resource s or strategic interests of value to either superpower. In short, détente would mark the beginning of the end for Israel as a world power because neither superpower had a stra tegic interest in Israel. 20 On June 10, 1963, President Kennedy delivered a spe ech, Strategy of Peace , before the graduating class at American University. Many r efer to it as \"The Peace Speech.\" The Manchester Guardian called the American University speech \"one of the greatest state papers of all time.\" The speech was the most eloquent and powerful of Kennedy’s career; it contained a spiritual ethos wi th a gripping message of hope for mankind, but it was also practical. Here are a few excerpts from the Peace Speech:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 6 ... What kind of a peace do I mean and what kind of a peace do we seek? Not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war. Not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave. I am talking about genuine p eace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living, the kind that enables men and nations to grow and to hope and bui ld a better life for their children—not merely peace for Americ ans but peace for all men and women—not merely peace in our time but peace for all time. ... ... I speak of peace because of the new face of war. Total war makes no sense in an age when great powers can main tain large and relatively invulnerable nuclear forces and refu se to surrender without resort to those forces. It makes no sense i n an age when a single nuclear weapon contains almost ten times t he explosive force delivered by all the allied air forces in the Second World War. It makes no sense in an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and water and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and t o generations yet unborn. ... ... I am not referring to the absolute, infinite conc ept of peace and good will of which some fantasies and fanatics drea m. I do not deny the value of hopes and dreams but we merely in vite discouragement and incredulity by making that our o nly and immediate goal. ... ...World peace, like community peace, does not requir e that each man love his neighbor—it requires only that they li ve together in mutual tolerance, submitting their disputes to a ju st and peaceful settlement. And history teaches us that enmities be tween nations, as between individuals, do not last foreve r. However fixed our likes and dislikes may seem, the tide of time and events will often bring surprising changes in the relation s between nations and neighbors. So let us persevere. Peace need not be impracticabl e, and war need not be inevitable. By defining our goal more c learly, by making it seem more manageable and less remote, we can help all peoples to see it, to draw hope from it, and to move irresistibly toward it. ... In short, both the United States and its allies, an d the Soviet Union and its allies, have a mutually deep interest in a just and genuine peace and in halting the arms race.

So, let us not be blind to our differences—but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved. And if we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help make the world sa fe for diversity. For, in the final analysis, our most bas ic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breat he the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are al l mortal. ... The United States, as the world knows, will never s tart a war. We do not want a war.

We are not helpless before that ta sk or hopeless of its success. Confident and unafraid, we must labor on—not toward a strategy of annihilation but toward a strategy of peace. [END] (JFK, American University, June 10, 1963) On June 16, 1963, six days after Kennedy’s American University speech, David Ben- Gurion resigned as prime minister of Israel. Michae l Collins Piper suggested in his book, Final Judgment , that Ben-Gurion resigned in order to go undergrou nd and carry out Kennedy’s assassination. It is my suspicion, ho wever, that Nahum Goldmann (president of the World Jewish Congress) issued the order to kill Kennedy immediately after the American University speech. I further suspect that Ben-Gurion was personally moved by Kennedy’s eloquent words an d refused to participate in the plot to kill him. Ben-Gurion may have had an epipha ny of sorts after hearing or reading Kennedy’s speech and was apparently overcom e with shame at the thought of plotting to kill such a wise man. In his later year s, Ben-Gurion renounced Zionism stating, \"I’m no longer a Zionist, I’m no longer a Socialist, I don’t belong to Histadrut , I resigned from the Knesset.\" 21 There were other motives for the assassination besi des Kennedy’s Cold War policy. To fully understand Israel’s motivation for killing Kennedy, it helps to understand Israel’s overall strategy. Israeli scholar and publ isher Simha Flapan explained that expansion was always Israel’s main objective. With respect to the original partition plan, in 1948, Flapan stated that \"acceptance of th e UN Partition Resolution was an example of Zionist pragmatism par excellance. It wa s a tactical acceptance, a vital step in the right direction—a springboard for expan sion when circumstances proved more judicious.\" 22 "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 8 In essence, Simha Flapan was saying that the foundi ng fathers of Israel had planned to violate UN treaties from the day Israel was founded in 1948. The breaking of vows— Jews recite a prayer called the Kol Nidre (all vows) on the eve of Yom Kippur which sanctifies the breaking of vows for the ensuing yea r 23 —has been a controversial part of the Jewish culture for centuries. In fact, most Rabbis omitted the Kol Nidre from Yom Kippur services in the 19 th Century because of its controversial nature, but i t was reinstated in 1945. 24 Having stated that, I believe most fair-minded stud ents of Middle Eastern history would agree that Israel had the following five-poin t strategy in 1963: 1. Israel planned to expand its borders by force. 2. Israel wanted the Cold War to continue (as Gromyko pointed out). In other words, Israel did not want détente between the two superpowers. 3. Israel wanted the Bomb. 4. Israel wanted to weaken Egyptian President Gamal Ab del Nasser because he was a lightning rod for Arab unity. 5. Israel wanted to divide the Arab nations. None of these five points could be achieved with a Kennedy in the White House. The Israelis distrusted President Kennedy because of hi s father. It is widely known that Joseph Kennedy Sr developed a strong loathing of Je ws from his business dealings with them in finance, Hollywood, and politics. And the elder Kennedy had groomed four sons for the White House, but his oldest—Joe, Jr—had been killed in World War II. President Kennedy’s inauguration in January 196 1 marked the beginning of a dynasty that would likely continue until 1985 (afte r the three surviving sons had each completed two terms). With this background information, it becomes clear that there was one primary motive for the assassination: to destroy the Kennedy Dynas ty. The reason Israel acted when they did was because Kennedy was on the verge of en ding the Cold War. He was also making plans to prevent them from acquiring the Bom b. This called for a drastic response. Destroying the Kennedy dynasty would allow Israel t o continue its annexation program, thereby acquiring more Arab land, somethin g that would be impossible while a Kennedy was in the White House. The culmina tion of Israel’s expansion was the Six Day War, in June 1967. Had the Kennedy Dyna sty not been destroyed, this could not have occurred until at least 1985. This i s not to suggest necessarily that precise planning for the Six Day Way was underway i n 1963; however, it is widely accepted that Israel planned to expand its borders since its founding in 1948, as Simha Flapan observed. This explains why Bobby Kennedy was assassinated, o n June 5, 1968, in a similar style as John. But despite stories that Bobby’s \"al leged\" assassin—Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian immigrant—hated him because of his loya lty to Israel, in reality Bobby Kennedy was not supported by American Jews in his 1 968 presidential campaign. 25 A year later Ted’s political career was nearly destro yed when he \"accidentally\" drove his car off an unmarked bridge on Chappaquiddick Is land, near Martha's Vineyard,"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" 9 Massachusetts, and his companion in the car, 28-yea r-old Mary Jo Kopechne, was drowned. In fact, Joe Kennedy Sr believed President Roosevel t was responsible for the death of his oldest son, Joe Jr. Kennedy believed that Roose velt reviewed the order to send his son on a high-risk bombing mission over France in w hich Joe Jr was killed. During the 1944 presidential campaign, Kennedy asked Senat or Harry S. Truman, Roosevelt’s running mate, \"Harry, what the hell are you doing campaigning for that crippled son of a bitch that killed my son Joe?\" 26 Truman responded, \"If you say another word about Ro osevelt, I’m going to throw you out the window.\" 27 Obviously there was no love lost between Truman an d Kennedy either. At this point, we have established two reasons why friends of Israel wanted to assassination President Kennedy: (a) to prevent dét ente between the United States and the Soviet Union, and (b), to destroy the Kennedy D ynasty. But there were several other motives. First of all, in 1945 a young Jack Kennedy wrote th e following words in his diary in praise of Adolf Hitler: After visiting these two places (Berchtesgaden and the Eagle’s lair on Obersalzberg), you can easily understand ho w that within a few years Hitler will emerge from the hatred that surrounds him now as one of the most significant figures who ever lived. He had boundless ambitions for his country which rendered him a menace to the peace of the world, but he had a myst ery about him in the way that he lived and in the manner of h is death that will live and grow after him. He had in him the stu ff of which legends are made. ( Prelude To Leadership - The European Diary of John F. Kennedy, Summer 19 45, Regnery Publishing, Inc., Washington DC, p. 74) Second point: In 1940 John Kennedy wrote a book, Why England Slept , which explored why Neville Chamberlain’s Britain was unpr epared for war with Hitler’s Germany. The book appears to be a fair-minded analy sis; however, it was a sensitive topic because Chamberlain was actually pro-Hitler. Consequently, even a balanced analysis of Chamberlain’s leadership would be frown ed upon by influential friends of Israel. In Why England Slept , Kennedy made the bold observation that Sir Arthur Balfour had essentially recanted the spirit the Balfour Declaration , a brief document officially authored by Balfour in 1917 and bore his name. ( Footnote 2 ) The Balfour Declaration stated the following: His Majesty's Government views with favor the estab lishment in"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" 10 Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existin g non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights and politica l status enjoyed by Jews in any other country. ( Balfour Declaration , November 2, 1917) In Why England Slept , Kennedy pointed out that that Sir Balfour’s opini on had changed considerably between 1917 and 1933. Kennedy wrote the following: In reading statements like that of Sir Arthur Balfo ur, Chairman of the Balfour Steel Company, made in 1933, \"One of th e gravest menaces to peace today is the totally unarmed condi tion of Germany,\" we should not dismiss it as being blindly stupid. We must remember that in the summer of 1939 a sufficie nt number of the Senate of the United States believed there woul d not be a war in Europe this year, and refused to repeal the embargo on arms. Every country makes great errors, and there i s usually a good reason for it at the time. We must also rememb er that we are looking at the problem from the vantage point o f 1940. In reading statements like Balfour’s we should try to realize that in 1933 the facts may have appeared to warrant an enti rely different interpretation. ( Why England Slept , JFK, 1940, Introduction, page xxv) Sir Balfour’s cited statement from 1933 indicates t hat he was obviously pro-German. This is significant because Hitler became chancello r (Kanzler) and Führer of Germany in 1933, and everyone knows that Hitler was anti-Jewish from the beginning. Therefore, by making pro-German statements the very year that Hitler rose to power in Germany, Balfour was in effect reneging on the t erms of the Balfour Declaration which committed Britain’s support to Palestine as a Jewish homeland. Kennedy had subtly pointed that fact out to informed readers of his book. ( Footnote 3 ) Third point: In 1956 then-Senator Kennedy indirectl y criticized the Nuremberg Trials by naming Senator Robert Taft as a courageous profi le in the acclaimed book, Profiles in Courage . Kennedy cited Taft for the \"courageous act\" of cr iticizing the Nuremberg Trials while they were in progress in 194 6. Fourth point: In July 1957, Senator Kennedy made th e front page of the New York Times when he delivered a speech on the Senate floor den ouncing French colonial occupation of Algeria. When Algeria was given indep endence in 1962, it became another Arab nation. In the eyes of Zionists, this posed yet another threat to Israel’s existence. In Kennedy’s speech, he also criticized French brutality in the French Algerian War. By supporting independence for Algeri a, Kennedy had indirectly aligned himself with Israel’s nemesis, Egyptian Pre sident Nasser. In the Arab world,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" 11 Nasser was as charismatic as Kennedy later became i n the West. Nasser openly promoted pan-Arab policies which garnered admiratio n among most Arab leaders and the Arab people. Nasser had publicly endorsed Alger ian independence from France, a position that would unite France with Israel agains t Egypt in the Suez Crisis of 1956. Fifth point: Both Kennedy and Khrushchev had strong er ties with Egyptian President Nasser than with Israel. Their befriending of Nasse r, a living icon symbolizing Arab unity, was a signal to Israel that both superpowers had more interest in the Arab world than in Israel’s continued existence as a Jewish ho meland, let alone its expansion into neighboring Arab territories. Sixth point: President Kennedy had voiced strong, a lbeit private, opposition to Israel’s development of the Bomb. The Kennedy Administration was well-aware of Israel’s nuclear reactor in Dimona. In fact, Kennedy and Ben -Gurion got into a heated personal exchange over that issue. Kennedy was conc erned about Israel’s nuclear capabilities and made a secret deal for regular Ame rican inspections of the nuclear reactor in Dimona in exchange for Hawk antiaircraft missiles, something that Ben- Gurion wanted. Ben-Gurion allowed an inspection onc e, but it was a deception. The Dimona facility was disguised to look like a nuclea r power plant, but the CIA advised Kennedy that this was not the case and advised the President to push for further inspections. Kennedy followed their advise. Histori an Michael Beschloss wrote that \"in the fall of 1963, Kennedy and Rusk were indeed casting about for some kind of cooperation with the Russians to keep Israel from g oing nuclear.\" 28 After Ben-Gurion resigned as prime minister in June 1963, he was replaced by Levi Eshkol. On July 5, 1963, President Kennedy sent a s trongly worded communiqué to Eshkol that American commitment and support of Isra el \"could be seriously jeopardized\" if Israel did not let the United State s obtain \"reliable information\" about Israel's efforts in the nuclear field. (Reference Appendix A for a transcript of the letter.) Seventh point: The Yemen War (the forgotten war) wa s another reason the Israelis disliked Kennedy. His strategy in that war was to m aintain Arab unity; however, part of Israel’s five-point strategy was to divide the A rab nations. The Yemen War is largely undocumented by Western historians, but Pre sident Kennedy became entangled in a civil war in Yemen which was still i n progress when he was killed. Initially, the Yemen War pitted Egypt and the Unite d States against Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Great Britain. Confusion erupted in Yemen following the death—of n atural causes—of its leader, Imam Ahmed, on September 18, 1962. Imam Ahmed was a n extraordinary but archaic man with the same values of rulers from the Middle Ages. He was succeeded by his son, Prince Mohammed al-Badr; however, the y ounger Imam was even more eccentric than his father. While on official delega tions, he would stop and climb trees and sit on a tree branch indefinitely. Clearly he w as not suited to rule a nation in the Twentieth Century. Within a week after the father d ied, the Prince was overthrown by Colonel Abdullah al Salal, a commander of the Royal Guard. The Colonel had been imprisoned for five years by the elder Imam and had endured inhuman living conditions while incarcerated. 29 "},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 12 Badr, escaped to the mountains and rallied loyal tr ibesmen to his cause, launching an armed struggle to regain the throne. He received ge nerous assistance from two monarchs, the kings of Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Sal al sent an emissary to Egypt who asked Nasser for help. Wanting to get Yemen out of the Middle Ages, Nasser sent troops to Yemen to support the new republican gover nment. Nasser’s support was important and understandable. He was not only the p resident of Egypt, but a charismatic advocate of the pan-Arab movement who s trove to maintain solidarity among Arab nations. 30 This made him the arch-enemy of friends of Israel since their goals were to divide and conquer Arab nations and e xpand its borders into their territories. Kennedy’s primary interest in Yemen was to hold the coalition of Islamic states together and deal with the conflict as a civil war. He encouraged the Yemenite government to resolve its problems internally witho ut support from outside nations. Consequently, he encouraged all Arab nations—Jordan , Saudi Arabia, and Egypt—to withdraw military forces from Yemen. 31 Kennedy’s policy of encouraging solidarity among Arab nations during the Yemen conflict was li kely another reason why friends of Israel wanted him killed. Israel has always want ed to divide, not unite, the Arab nations. With Kennedy out of the way, the Arab coal ition became much weaker as the Israelis planned their efforts to expand its border s. In addition, Nasser’s influence diminished greatly. This was largely due to Egypt’s prolonged involvement the Yemen War. The following is historian William Cleveland’s desc ription of how solidarity among Islamic States was obliterated by the Yemen War: By 1965 nearly 70,000 Egyptian troops were engaged on the side of the military regime in Yemen. Bogged down in dif ficult terrain and harassed by guerrillas, the Egyptian forces suf fered heavy losses and were finally withdrawn in 1968. In this case, Egypt’s intervention divided Arab loyalties instead of unif ying them; it presented the spectacle of Arab fighting Arab and o f the heads of state of Saudi Arabia and Egypt hurling insults at one another. (William Cleveland, A History of the Modern Middle East , p. 296) To summarize the motives, friends of Israel had no use for Joseph Kennedy, Sr or any of his sons because of the elder Kennedy’s well-kno wn dislike of Jews. And John Kennedy had displayed similar views throughout his adult life. But it was the young president’s efforts to end the Cold War, to prevent Israel from acquiring the Bomb, and his efforts to maintain Arab unity in the Yemen war that made pro-Israel forces decide to stage a coup d’état in the fall of 1963. The Plot Against Kennedy After years of research, I have developed the follo wing scenario of how the plot against President Kennedy was conceived and accompl ished:"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" 13 I believe the assassination was decreed by Nahum Go ldmann, founder of the World Jewish Congress and its president in 1963, after ta king counsel from influential friends of Israel. They likely included, but were n ot limited to the following individuals: \u0001 David Ben-Gurion, Prime Minister of Israel and head of the Mapai Party (1948-53 & 1955-63) \u0001 Levi Eshkol, Prime Minister of Israel and head of t he Mapai-Labour Party (1963-69) \u0001 Golda Meir, Prime Minister of Israel and head of th e Labour Party (1969-74) \u0001 Menachem Begin, former commander of the terrorist o rganization, Irgun Zvai Leumi (Hebrew: National Military Organization), Pri me Minister of Israel and head of the Likud Party (1977-83) \u0001 Yitzhak Shamir, former member of the terrorist orga nization known as the Stern Gang, also a former member of Irgun Zvai Leum i, Prime Minister of Israel and head of the Likud Party (1983-84 & 1986- 92) \u0001 Yitzhak Rabin, Prime Minister of Israel and head of the Labour Party (1974- 77 & 1992-95) \u0001 Samuel Bronfman, billionaire businessman, former bo otlegger, owner of Seagram-Distillers Corporation; resided in Montreal \u0001 Louis Bloomfield, international lawyer (and Bronfma n’s attorney), contractor for the CIA and FBI, formerly a British Intelligenc e officer who served in Palestine under the command of General Charles Orde Wingate training Haganah soldiers during the Arab Revolt in the 1930 s; resided in Montreal \u0001 Bernard Bloomfield (brother of Louis), influential businessman; resided in Montreal One can easily see Goldmann, speaking not only for himself, but as President of the World Jewish Congress that year, prophesing that Pr esident Kennedy should die for the nation of Israel. And his death would not only be for that nation, but for all friends of Israel scattered abroad. From that day forth they plotted to kill him. Louis Bloomfield was directed to manage the assassi nation. And he did so with the full knowledge and support of Lyndon Baines Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover. In 1963 the top underworld figure in the American M afia was Jewish mob leader Meyer Lansky. 32 In addition to heroin, Lansky had major interests in gambling, especially in Florida, pre-Castro Cuba, the Bahamas , and Las Vegas. 33 Santo Trafficante was one of Lanksy’s chief lieutenants 34 who controlled the Florida-Cuba- Bahamas corridor. Bloomfield met with Lansky about hiring assassins. It was agreed that the Guerini Family, a leading French-Corsican crime family, wou ld provide the hit men. 35 This was a logical choice since the CIA had a long histo ry with the Guerini Family since the late 1940s. 36 The assassins chosen were close associates of Augu ste Joseph Ricord, a French-Corsican gangster living in Argentina afte r being convicted of collaborating with the Third Reich and sentenced to death in abse ntia by the Permanent Military Court of Paris. Their names were Lucien Sarti, Fran çois Chiappe, and Jean-Paul"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 14 Angeletti; originally from Marseilles, France. A fo urth man, Christian David, was also offered the contract, but he refused. David an d the three hit men eventually became Ricord’s lieutenants when he emerged as the number one smuggler of heroin into the United States in the late 1960s and early 70s. 37 Bloomfield knew that the American Mafia and the Fre nch-Corsican syndicates of Marseilles were looking for a new source of heroin and morphine base because their previous source, the Mediterranean Basin, had devel oped insurmountable problems. 38 Faced with the prospect of either finding a new sou rce or going out of business, Bloomfield helped them establish Southeast Asia as a primary source. 39 Links had already been established between Corsican gangsters in Marseilles and those in Southeast Asia during the First Indochina War (1946 -1954), but the relationship needed to be strengthened. 40 A deal was apparently struck—brokered by Bloomfield —between the American Mafia and the Corsican crime syndicates. If the Cor sicans would supply the assassins, Bloomfield would have Kennedy’s replacement, Presid ent Johnson, escalate American involvement in the Vietnam War and allow t he Corsicans to re-enter the narcotics industry in Southeast Asia. Under the lea dership of General Edward G. Lansdale (then a Colonel), the Corsicans were drive n out of Vietnam in 1955 after the French had been defeated in the Indochina War. Lans dale did more than any single person to drive the Corsican drug smugglers out of Vietnam, depose the corrupt Prime Minister Bay Vien (head of Binh Xuyen) and put Ngo Dinh Diem in power. 41 Years later, Lansdale was implicated in the assassination of JFK by several so-called researchers in an apparent vendetta against the Gen eral for driving the Corsicans out years earlier. It appears that Bloomfield also assisted the heroin traffickers in laundering large sums of money generated from the criminal enterprise. Be ing a skilled lawyer, Bloomfield apparently set up fake corporations 42 in order to funnel heroin money into numerous banks throughout the world. 43 The proceeds from the narcotics enterprise would b e divided among the participants by channeling the il licit drug money to appropriate bank accounts. Bloomfield would also use this vast international criminal enterprise to finance assassinations of other political figures. Such targets included assassination attempts on French President Charles de Gaulle 44 and the murder of Moroccan political exile Mehdi Ben Barka. 45 Both men supported Algerian independence, 46 as did John Kennedy when—as a United States Senator—he made a controversial speech in support of Algerian independence. 47 Israel was opposed to granting Algeria its independence because it would mean the establis hment of another Islamic state. The Assassination In the fall of 1963, the three assassins were flown from Marseilles to Mexico City where they spent some three or four weeks at the ho use of a contact. They were then driven from Mexico City to the US border at Brownsv ille, Texas. They crossed the border using Italian passports. They were picked up on the American side of the border at Brownsville by a representative of the Ch icago Mafia with whom they conversed in Italian. They were then driven to Dall as and put up in a safehouse which"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" 15 had been prepared for them so as not to leave hotel records. They spent several days taking photographs of Dealey Plaza, and in the even ings at the safehouse they studied the photographs and they arranged a \"crossfire\" wit h three guns. 48 On November 22, shortly before the presidential mot orcade drove through Dallas, the assassins were driven to Dealey Plaza. Chiappe and Angeletti took their positions in two office buildings; one was high, one was low. Sa rti stood behind a picket fence on top of a hill near the middle of Elm Street, his ri fle loaded with exploding bullets. He was disguised as a policeman. As the limousine appr oached the center of Elm Street one shot was fired from a lower-level window of the Dal-Tex building directly behind the car; a bullet struck Kennedy in the back of the neck. 49 He clutched his throat with both hands, his elbows raised high. 50 Four seconds later, 51 a second shot rang out from an upper-level window of the Texas School Book Depo sitory, hitting Texas Governor John Connally in the back, 52 above his right armpit; his torso was turned to th e right as he was struck. 53 He sustained five wounds from one bullet, each wou nd being to the left and below the previous. He was sitting dir ectly in front of Kennedy. 54 One second later 55 Sarti fired from behind the picket fence hitting K ennedy in the right temple slamming his body backward and to the left, then slumping sideways in the seat. The bone in his right temple fell beside his ear as the back of his head exploded. 56 He was declared legally dead shortly thereafter. A fourth shot was fired that missed the car complet ely, but grazed onlooker James Teague in the cheek; 57 it was fired simultaneously with one of the other shots. 58 The Framing of Oswald Within hours a low-level intelligence officer who w orked for the United States government was arrested and subsequently charged wi th the murder of President Kennedy. His name was Lee Harvey Oswald; he was als o accused of shooting Dallas police officer Jefferson Davis Tippet shortly after Kennedy was killed. Oswald was completely innocent. 59 Bloomfield had used him as a patsy, a scapegoat to throw the public off the trail of the true assas sins. 60 Under Bloomfield’s direction, Oswald’s associates and handlers had given him assi gnments for months designed to self-incriminate. 61 While living in New Orleans in the summer of 1963, his handlers were Guy Banister 62 and Clay Shaw 63 (aka, Clay Bertrand) who reported directly to Bloomfield. 64 One of Oswald’s associates was David Ferrie, an ec centric homosexual and professional pilot. 65 Ferrie had flown the assassins from Dallas to Mont real in a private plane several days after the assassination. 66 From there Bloomfield arranged to have them flown back to Marseilles, France. 67 Two days after the assassination, Oswald was shot a nd killed by Jack Ruby, a Dallas clubowner with links to Meyer Lansky 68 and other mob figures; he had also worked as an FBI informant. Ruby was part of the conspiracy; eye-witnesses saw him in compromising situations on the day Kennedy was kill ed. Julia Ann Mercer testified before the Warren Commission—her testimony was late r illegally altered—that she saw a young man with a rifle dismount from a pickup truck driven by Jack Ruby at"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 16 Dealy Plaza about an hour before the assassination. 69 While in custody, Oswald had not cooperated with the conspirators and it was dec ided that he must be killed. Ruby’s handlers advised him to kill Oswald or be implicate d in Kennedy’s murder as well. 70 This was done under the direction of Bloomfield. The Warren Commission Upon assuming the presidency, Johnson immediately f ormed a commission ostensibly to investigate the assassination, but the real agen da was to cover-up the truth from the American public. It was named the The Warren Commission after its distinguished chairman, Chief Justice Earl Warren. After months o f research, the commission issued a report which concluded that Oswald had acted alon e and there was not a conspiracy. A large percentage of the commission’s members, how ever, were Jewish; not as ranking members, but as assistant counsel and staff members. The following is a complete listing of the members of the Warren Commi ssion: Ranking Members Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chairman Senator Richard B. Russell Senator John Sherman Cooper Representative Hale Boggs Representative Gerald R. Ford Mr. Allen W. Dulles (former CIA director, fired by Kennedy) Mr. John J. McCloy J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel Assistant Counsel Francis W. H. Adams Joseph A. Ball David W. Belin William T. Coleman, Jr. Melvin Aron Eisenberg Burt W. Griffin Leon D. Hubert, Jr. Albert E.

Weinreb "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 17 Commission Attorneys David Belin and Arlen Specter Two Jewish assistant counsels for the Warren Commis sion, David Belin and Arlen Specter, rose to prominence in the years following the assassination. Belin wrote books and made numerous talk show appearances endor sing the Warren Report. As assistant counsel, Belin had a gift for changing th e subject when questioning witnesses about to reveal important information. In other words, his task was apparently to prevent the crime from being solved. For example, Belin questioned Dallas Police officer, Sergeant D.V. Harkness, who told Belin (under oath) that he saw several strangers using a departing train to le ave the area where President Kennedy had just been murdered. Belin responded: \"I want to go back to this Amos Euins. Do you remem ber what he said to you and what you said to him when you first saw him?\" 71 Amos Euins was another witness who had nothing to d o with trains or the grassy knoll. Belin was clearly changing the subject. Arlen Specter authored the portion of the Warren Re port that critics call the \"Magic Bullet Theory.\" Years later Specter was elected US Senator representing Pennsylvania for the Republican Party. In 1994, Specter chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee after the Republicans had won control of the Senate in the fall elections. The Senate Intelligence Committee provides oversight of all US intelligence services including the CIA and FBI. In fact, Specter chaired the power ful oversight committee when the Murrah Building, in Oklahoma City, was bombed on Ap ril 19, 1995. There is strong evidence to suggest that Israel was behind the bomb ing of the Murrah Building as well. That act of terrorism was not unlike the bomb ing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem by Jewish extremists on July 22, 1946. Bo th topics are discussed later. The Means: Division Five and Permindex J. Edgar Hoover allowed Bloomfield to run what is k nown as FBI Division Five, an \"independent\" covert enterprise set up by Hoover an d William Sullivan. Division Five was not an official part of the government, althoug h many of its leaders held high- ranking official positions. This was the mechanism Bloomfield used to stage the coup against Kennedy. Lyndon Johnson was fully aware of Division Five and was an active participant with Bloomfield and Hoover in setting u p the coup. 72 It should be noted that William Sullivan, co-founde r of Division Five, was shot and killed with a high-powered rifle near his home in N ew Hampshire in November 1977. Sullivan had just completed a preliminary meeting w ith investigators for the House Select Committee on Assassinations. The man who sho t him was the son of a state policeman and claimed to have mistaken Sullivan for a deer. He was arrested, charged with a misdemeanor—\"shooting a human being by accid ent\"—and released into the custody of his father. No further investigation was ever done. 73 In addition, Sullivan was finishing an exposé on Hoover’s FBI, with journ alist Bill Brown, when he was killed. Two years later, Brown published Sullivan’s book entitled, The Bureau: My"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 18 Thirty Years in Hoover’s FBI . It was a major indictment of J. Edgar Hoover and Lyndon Johnson. Divison Five was apparently given that name because it managed spy networks within five different political/military groups. With Bloo mfield managing those five groups, a more accurate name would have been Division Six, because he added Israel’s interests to the overall agenda. He added a sixth l ayer, Permindex, a dummy trade corporation used to finance Israeli espionage and p olitical assassinations. In addition Permindex was a tool for laundering illicit heroin money for American and French- Corsican-Latino crime syndicates. By combining Permindex with Hoover’s Division Five, Bloomfield had control of the following six intelligence units: \u0001 The Security Division of NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) – This group represented the munitions industry. T hey were opposed to Kennedy because he was trying to make pe ace with the Soviets and end the Cold War. Since the Security Division w as in the war business, Kennedy was of no value to them. He was a threat to them financially. NASA was used mainly as a cover because the American pub lic associated it with space travel. In fact, the security division of NAS A was headquartered at the Defense Industrial Security Command (DISC) in Alaba ma and Ohio. DISC was the police and espionage agency for US munition s makers. \u0001 The Solidarists – This group represented Jewish exiles from Russia and Eastern Europe. \u0001 The American Council of Christian Churches – This group supported right- wing political agendas mixed with Evangelical Chris tianity. The latter supported the state of Israel for religious purpose s. The ACCC also had operatives in right-wing extremist groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the John Birch Society. The common thread who supported Isra el. \u0001 The Free Cuba Committee – This group consisted of anti-Communist extremists who opposed Castro. \u0001 The Syndicate – US mobsters with gambling casinos in Havana, Cub a and the Caribbean; headed by Meyer Lansky and his lieutenan t Santo Trafficante. \u0001 Permindex – A dummy trade corporation created by Bloomfield to finance covert activity internationally for the state of Is rael; also used to launder illicit heroin profits for American and French-Corsican-Lat ino crime syndicates. This was separate from the FBI’s Division Five, but since it was run by Bloomfield, it was a de facto leg of the Division F ive intelligence network. 74 Joseph Milteer Corroborated Jewish Conspiracy Joseph Milteer was a wealthy southerner from Georgi a with right-wing extremist political beliefs. He was an active member of the C onstitutional America Party and had acquaintances in the Ku Klux Klan. 75 His politics were a mixture of ultra-right extremism mixed with Evangelical Christianity which included the belief in Armageddon. Evangelicals believe Jews are needed to establish a Jewish state so that Jesus will return, gather all Jews in Israel, and b uild a Temple. The world would then"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 19 end and practically all the Jews would be killed at Armageddon. The few Jewish survivors would convert to Christianity. 76 Evangelical ministers Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwe ll are both big supporters of Israel because of their belief in Armageddon. Rober tson in particular is a big believer in Armageddon. The bizarre thing about Evangelicals is they do not hesitate to encourage Jewish conversion to Christianity; howeve r, they also feel that Jews are needed in order to fulfill the scriptures. When Menachem Begin was cautioned that Evangelical aid was provided to Israel only because they believed that a new Jewish state was needed for the second coming of Jesus, and the conversion of Jews to Christianit y, he reportedly responded: \"I tell you, if the Christian Fundamentalists support us in Congress today, I will support them when the Messiah comes tomorrow.\" 77 On November 9, 1963, Miami police informant William Somersett met with Joseph Milteer who proceeded to outline the assassination of President Kennedy. Milteer stated that Kennedy would be shot \"from an office b uilding with a high-powered rifle,\" and \"they will pick somebody up within hour s afterwards, if anything like that would happen, just to throw the public off.\" 78 This was thirteen days before Kennedy was assassinated. Milteer definitely knew what he w as talking about. On November 23, 1963, the day after Kennedy was sho t, Milteer met with Somersett again and stated that there was a \"Communist conspi racy by Jews to overthrow the United States.\" 79 He further stated that Martin Luther King and Atto rney General Kennedy were now unimportant, but the next move wou ld be against \"the big Jew.\" 80 This information is extremely important because Mil teer was clearly a man with prior knowledge about the plans to kill President Kennedy . Despite his extremist politics, Milteer was a person to be taken seriously. His com ment about Martin Luther King, Robert Kennedy, and \"the big Jew\" tells us three th ings. First, his reference to \"the big Jew\" corroborates my thesis that one Jewish individ ual—likely Louis Bloomfield— ran the coup against Kennedy. Second, it reveals th at right-wing extremists had broken ranks with the Jewish-led coup immediately a fter Kennedy was killed. Apparently, Milteer and his associates had made a p act with Bloomfield to support the coup while they secretly plotted to kill him—Bloomf ield—after Kennedy was executed. Third, it suggests that contingency plans were in place in 1963—by the right-wing extremists—to kill Martin Luther King an d Robert Kennedy. Further evidence indicates that Milteer personally declared a right-wing war on the Jews. On November 24, just two days after Kennedy w as killed, Milteer apparently delivered a speech before the Constitutional American Party at Columbia, South Carolina. He reportedly made the following statemen ts: ... to all Christians: The Zionist Jews killed Christ 2000 years ago and on November 22, 1963, they killed President Ken nedy. You Jews killed the President. We are going to kill you . 81 "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 20 Such an action against Jews was not surprising in l ight of the origins of the Ku Klux Klan. Originally formed in Nashville, Tennessee in 1867 by Confederate cavalry general Nathan Bedford Forrest, the Klan disappeare d by 1882 because its original objective—the restoration of white supremacy throug hout the South—had largely been achieved during the 1870s. In addition, Forres t had ordered it disbanded in 1869, because of the group's excessive violence. 82 The second wave of Klan activity began when it was reorganized in 1915, not because of strong anti-black sentiment, but because white P rotestants in small-town America felt threatened by the Bolshevik revolution in Russ ia and by the large-scale immigration of the previous decades that had change d the ethnic character of American society. 83 Milteer’s call to arms against Jews may have intens ified hatred by the Ku Klux Klan against Jews and blacks alike in its opposition to the Civil Rights movement. On June 21, 1964, three civil rights workers—Michael Schwer ner, Andrew Goodman and James Earl Chaney—were abducted and killed by the K u Klux Klan in Mississippi. Two of those men were Jewish; only one was African- American. Their abduction occurred just seven months after Kennedy’s assassin ation. As soon as the three workers turned up missing, Pre sident Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover launched a massive investigation. The fate o f the three men was uncertain, but their disappearance provided the final impetus need ed for the 1964 Civil Rights Act to pass. The bodies of Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney w ere found five weeks later, buried in a mud dam. Eventually, 19 men, including the county sheriff and a deputy, were convicted of federal conspiracy charges in con nection with the murders. On the surface, Johnson and Hoover seemed courageou s in their fight against right- wing extremists; but in reality, they had plotted j ointly with the same forces to kill Kennedy. The chickens had indeed come home to roost . George Wallace and Curtis LeMay Did Joseph Milteer have enough influence—even withi n his group of right-wing extremists—to declare a war against Jews? As it tur ns out, he may have had assistance from at least one prominent politician, namely Alabama Governor George Wallace who was friendly with right-wing General Cu rtis LeMay, a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Kennedy administration . LeMay was a hawkish adversary of Kennedy’s during the Cuban Missile Crisis. 84 Their animosity toward one another has been widely documented. The Constitutional American Party —the group that Milteer reportedly addressed on November 24, 1963 when he declared war on the Jews— later evolved into Wallace’s third-party, The American Independent Party , when he ran for president in 1968. 85 General LeMay was his running mate. George Wallace loathed the Kennedy brothers and Mar tin Luther King because they shamed him in June 1963 during a standoff at the Un iversity of Alabama where"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 21 Wallace stood in the doorway to block enrollment of black students. Under President Kennedy's direction, Bobby Kennedy called out the A labama National Guard who forced Wallace to step aside. Martin Luther King wa s in the middle of the conflict as well. In fact, he solicited the aid of the Kennedy brothers to deal with Wallace. Wallace wanted to be president badly, probably more than Lyndon Johnson. And he would not have a chance until 1985 when the Kennedy Dynasty was over (after John, Bobby and Ted had each served two terms). LeMay was one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during t he Kennedy administration. He was an ardent cold warrior, and partly for this rea son his tenure as chief was neither successful nor happy. LeMay found himself at consta nt odds with the management policies of Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and t he \"flexible response\" military strategy of Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman General Maxwell Taylor. 86 Kennedy’s relationship with the military was strain ed, 87 to say the least, but he and Lemay displayed mutual contempt for one another. Ke nnedy once remarked after one his many walkouts on the General, \"I don't want tha t man near me again.\" 88 LeMay was one of the generals who put heavy pressur e on Kennedy to attack Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Having been ill-ad vised once before by the Joint Chiefs during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Kennedy was not willing to make the same mistake twice. He remarked, \"Those sons of bitches with all the fruit salad just sat there nodding, saying it would work.\" 89 In his four years as chief, LeMay argued vigorously for new air weapons like the B70 bomber and the Skybolt missile, and against the swi ngwing \"fighter\" plane, the General Dynamics TFX (later named the F111). He los t all these battles. In addition, LeMay had strong feelings regarding American involv ement in Vietnam, arguing against the gradual response advocated by the Admin istration. Once again he was ignored. 90 Lemay was in effect arguing on behalf of the muniti ons industry. As previously stated, the munitions industry was represented in Hoover’s Division Five the powerful intelligence apparatus used by Louis Bloomfield to orchestrate the coup against Kennedy. More specifically, the munitions industry was represented within Division Five under the auspices of the Security Division of NASA which was headquartered at the Defense Industrial Security Command (DISC) i n George Wallace’s home state of Alabama and also Ohio. DISC was the police and e spionage agency for US munitions makers. This was all under the control of Louis Bloomfield through his control of the FBI’s \"free-lance\" espionage unit, D ivision Five. Joseph Milteer’s reference to the \"big Jew\" corrobo rates that there was in fact a Jewish conspiracy apparently headed by one Jewish i ndividual. That person was Louis Bloomfield. The Assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Lut her King"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 22 Division Five was apparently used to kill Martin Lu ther King and Robert Kennedy in 1968 and blame the murders on patsies, James Earl R ay and Sirhan Sirhan. Malevolent forces converged against King and Kenned y because the latter was about to assume the presidency and former was endorsing h im. Both wanted to end US involvement in the Vietnam War, but several interes ts would prevail over their wishes. First, the right-wing extremists hated both men bec ause of they—along with President Kennedy—had embarrassed George Wallace in June 1963 when the Alabama National Guard forced him to allow black students t o enroll at the University of Alabama. Second, Israel absolutely did not want the son of Joseph Kennedy to become president. None of the Kennedys could be cou nted on to support Israel’s annexation program of expanding its borders into ne ighboring Arab territories. Third, American and French-Corsican-Latino crime syndicate s wanted the Vietnam War to continue because they were reaping huge profits fro m the Golden Triangle from its production of opium. Those profits were apparently being shared with senior military personnel and various wealthy interests within the Western Powers. In March of 1967 Senator Robert Kennedy announced a peace plan for Vietnam and soon became an outspoken antiwar advocate. 91 Martin Luther King quickly followed the senator’s lead. On April 4, 1967, at Riverside Church in New York City and again on the 15th at a mammoth peace rally in that city, King committed himself irrevocably to opposing US involvement in the Vietn am War. Once before, in early January 1966, he had condemned the war, but officia l outrage from Washington and strenuous opposition within the black community its elf had caused him to acquiesce. 92 On Jan. 30, 1968, the Tet Offensive began. It was a massive attack launched by the North Vietnamese on the Tet (lunar new year) Vietna mese festival. It marked a new beginning of anti-war sentiment amongst many Americ ans. Gene McCarthy had been campaigning for the presidency on the Democratic ti cket. On March 16, 1968, Robert Kennedy announced his candidacy for the presidency; 93 Martin Luther King immediately endorsed him. On March 31, 1968, Presid ent Johnson startled television viewers with a national address that included three announcements: (1) he had just ordered major reductions in the bombing of North Vi etnam, (2) he was requesting peace talks, and (3) he would neither seek nor acce pt his party's renomination for the presidency. 94 On April 4 King was killed by a sniper's bullet wh ile standing on the balcony of a motel in Memphis, Tennessee where he a nd his associates were staying. On March 10, 1969, the accused assassin, James Earl Ray, pleaded guilty to the murder and was sentenced to 99 years in prison. 95 Ray later recanted his confession. By June 4, 1968 Robert Kennedy had won five out of six presidential primaries, including one that day in California. Shortly after midnight on June 5 he spoke to his followers in Los Angeles' Ambassador Hotel. As he l eft through a kitchen hallway he was fatally wounded by a Palestinian immigrant, Sir han Bishara Sirhan; at least that’s the official story. Robert Kennedy died the next da y on June 6, 1968. 96 The Coup Against Nixon"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 23 As it turns out, Watergate was not the only cover-u p in the Nixon White House. Joan Hoff, a research professor of history at Montana St ate University, recently wrote an article asserting that on December 21, 1971—six mon ths before the Watergate burglary occurred—Nixon approved the first major co ver-up of his administration; however, he was not covering up his own misdeeds. H e was covering up the Navy’s. Nixon had learned that Admiral Thomas Moorer, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had authorized his subordinates to spy on the White House’s National Security Counsel. For thirteen months, from 1970 to late 197 1, Navy Yeoman Charles E. Radford systematically stole and copied NSC documen ts from Alexander Haig, Henry Kissinger, and their staff. When Nixon learned of t his, he ordered it hushed up; but he let the military know he was aware of its spying. A pparently Nixon and his aides thought that approach would give them more leverage dealing with a hostile defense establishment. 97 To evaluate Nixon fairly, one must consider the tim es in which he served as President. He took office just six years after a coup d’état w hich pushed America deeply into a war in Southeast Asia, a conflict that evolved into an opium war. The aftermath of President Kennedy’s assassination was a highly unst able government in which a variety of carpetbaggers lined their pockets, profi teering from the sale of illicit heroin made from opium grown in the Golden Triangle. This volatile state of affairs created havoc within the US intelligence community. One set of federal agents worked desperately to stop the flow of heroin traffic from entering US borders while another group looked the other way. Vietnam was a cynical war run by a variety of inter ests. It became a continuation of opium smuggling that had been practiced by the West ern Powers for nearly two centuries. In the 1940s, opium trafficking went und erground and was handled secretly by international crime syndicates working jointly w ith various espionage services. Practically speaking, it was not within Nixon’s pow er to end the war by issuing an Executive decree. He did, however, manage to withdr aw American forces by first severely crippling Auguste Ricord’s drug cartel, th en establishing détente with the Soviet Union followed by relentless bombing of Nort h Vietnam (the Christmas Bombing, Dec. 1972). The latter effort was done to force North Vietnam back to the Paris peace talks where a cease-fire and peace agre ement was subsequently reached. Finally Nixon withdrew US troops from Vietnam and e nded the draft. In addition he dramatically increased financial aid to Israel, app arently an effort to divide his enemies in that country and supporters abroad. Within the context of history, many of Nixon’s acti ons regarding China, the Soviet Union, Vietnam, and the heroin war were indeed bold and courageous. Media Moguls The most important tool, however, to ensure success of the 1963 coup d’état was a non-government entity: the American news media. Thi s is where the ancient Jewish culture comes into play. A thorough analysis of the media’s coverage of President Kennedy’s assassination reveals a vast presence and relentless participation of Jewish journalists and correspondents supporting the cover story that Lee Harvey Oswald"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 24 alone shot and killed Kennedy. Examples include Mar tin Agronsky, Elie Abel, Irving R. Levine, Peter Hackes, Kenneth Bernstein, Lief Ed e, Gabe Pressman, and Walter Lippmann to name a few. It is difficult to believe that such widespread end orsement of the Oswald cover story could have occurred by chance. The sheer magnitude of Jewish participation within the news media leads to the logical conclusion that a clear signal must have been given by a central figure and symbol of authority w ithin the Jewish culture in 1963. I have concluded that the individual in question was Nahum Goldmann, founder of the World Jewish Congress and its president in 1963. I have further concluded that the World Jewish Congress is tantamount to the Sanhedri n, the Jewish Council in ancient Palestine under Roman rule that issued the order to kill Jesus. The high-priest of the Sanhedrin, Joseph Caiaphas, issued the decree to kill Jesus. Caiaphas was appointed by Roman procurator (governo r) Valerius Gratus, predecessor of Pontius Pilate. Caiaphas questioned Jesus before handing him over to Pilate for crucifixion. 98 As president of the World Jewish Congress, Nahum Goldmann was the 1963 equivalent of Joseph Caiaphas . Once a decree to kill Kennedy was issued by high-priest Goldmann, then Je wish individuals within the American news media became active participants in t he 1963 coup d’état. Today, seven Jewish Americans run the vast majority of US television networks, the printed press, the Hollywood movie industry, the bo ok publishing industry, and the recording industry. Most of these industries are bu ndled into huge media conglomerates run by the following seven individual s: 99 \u0001 Gerald Levin, ( Footnote 4 ) CEO and Director of AOL Time Warner \u0001 Michael Eisner, Chairman and CEO of the Walt Disney Company \u0001 Edgar Bronfman, Sr., ( Footnote 5 ) Chairman of Seagram Company Ltd \u0001 Edgar Bronfman, Jr, ( Footnote 6 ) President and CEO of Seagram Company Ltd and head of Universal Studios \u0001 Sumner Redstone, Chairman and CEO of Viacom, Inc \u0001 Dennis Dammerman, Vice Chairman of General Electric \u0001 Peter Chernin, President and Co-COO of News Corpora tion Limited Those seven Jewish men collectively control ABC, NB C, CBS, the Turner Broadcasting System, CNN, MTV, Universal Studios, M CA Records, Geffen Records, DGC Records, GRP Records, Rising Tide Records, Curb /Universal Records, and Interscope Records. Most of the larger independent newspapers are owned by Jewish interests as well. An example is media mogul is Samuel I. \"Si\" Newhouse, who owns two dozen daily newspapers from Staten Island to Oregon, plus the S unday supplement Parade; the Conde Nast collection of magazines, including Vogue , The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, Allure, GQ, and Self; the publishing firms of Rando m House, Knopf, Crown, and Ballantine, among other imprints; and cable franchi ses with over one million subscribers."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 25 NBC was founded by David Sarnoff, a Russian born Je w who studied the Talmud as a child, rose to prominence by picking up the sinking Titanic's distress signal, later served under Eisenhower in World War II, and was ma de a brigadier general. 100 Another Jewish media mogul in Kennedy’s time was Wi lliam Paley, president of Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). Paley was also a highly trained expert in psychological warfare, which is a military term for propaganda. The Encyclopedia Britannica provided some interesting facts about Pa ley’s World War II activity in the \"Mediterranean\": During World War II Paley served the US government as supervisor of the Office of War Information (OWI) i n the Mediterranean, and later as chief of radio in the O WI's Psychological Warfare Division (1944-45), finally b ecoming deputy chief of the Psychological Warfare Division. 101 One of the most influential and widely respected ne wspaper commentators in Kennedy’s time was Walter Lippmann, an ardent Zioni st. In 1917, Lippmann served briefly as an assistant to Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson sent Lippmann to France to take part in the negotiations for the Treaty of Versailles. The stated examples of behind the scenes political influence and manipulation may explain, to a degree, why Jews were expelled from v irtually every country in Western Europe from 1290 through 1551. With such control of American political institutions and the news media, Jewish political forces have th e ability to manipulate war and peace, crush nations, and topple sitting heads of s tate. This was the situation when Jesus walked the earth two-thousand years ago, 102 it is the situation today, and it was the state of affairs in President Kennedy’s time. Endnotes 1.

Jim Garrison, On the Trail of the Assassins , pp. 281-282) Each wound was below and to the left of the previous. Therefore, the shot was fired from above and to the right. Hence, the shot that hit Connally was fired from an \"upper-level window of the Texas School Book Depository.\" 53. The fact that Connally’s torso was turned to the ri ght was determined by viewing the Zapruder film. It also matches his description of the shots ( The Men Who Killed Kennedy ). His sitting position is critical because it establishes the dir ection from which the bullet was fired. Some researchers get confused on this point. (example, J .

Anyone with money can hire assassins, but covering up the crime is more diffic ult. This required the full cooperation of key people within the American news media. One such participant was correspondent for NBC television, the late Martin A gronsky. It’s interesting that Agronsky, a Jew, began his journalism career in 193 6 as a reporter for the Palestine Post , now the Jerusalem Post . 1 As it Happened , a four hour film showing NBC-TV’s live coverage o f President Kennedy’s assassination on November 22, 1963, revea ls that Agronsky aggressively promoted Lyndon Johnson as an able replacement for the slain Kennedy rather than merely report the tragic events. Agronksy’s behavio r suggests that he and Johnson were both active participants in the coup d’état of 1963 and therefore had prior knowledge of Kennedy’s murder. The raw NBC footage reveals how the media coup was executed. There were two types of news men: those \"reporting\" the news and t hose \"interpreting\" the news. Those reporting the news were almost exclusively ge ntiles. They included Frank McGee, Bill Ryan, Chet Huntley, David Brinkly, Robe rt McNeil, Charles Murphy (of WBAP-TV Fort Worth, Dallas), and Tom Whelan (also o f WBAP). In stark contrast, the ones interpreting the news—or \"correspondents\" as they called themselves—were almost all Jewish. They included Martin Agronsky, E lie Abel, Irving R. Levine, Peter Hackes, Kenneth Bernstein, Lief Ede, and Gabe Press man. The Oswald cover story and supporting propaganda/di sinformation was shaped and controlled by three factions: (1) the Jewish corres pondents, (2) the Dallas Police, and (3) the Associated Press. The Jewish correspondents ’ jobs were to promote Lyndon Johnson as Kennedy’s replacement, to prepare the pu blic for shifts in foreign affairs, and to generally control the flow of information by putting a spin on things as needed. The Dallas Police department’s job, from a propagan distic viewpoint, was to leak the cover story to the AP wire and other media outlets that Lee Harvey Oswald had killed Dallas Police officer J. D. Tippet and had shot and killed President Kennedy from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. Th e AP’s function was to flood all levels of the news media with a cover story that vi lified Oswald, portraying him as a lone gunner, a nut, an expatriate who moved to the Soviet Union and married a Russian woman, an unstable man who supported Commun ism and belonged to a pro- Castro group in New Orleans. As previously stated, Agronsky’s role was mainly to promote the new president, Lyndon Johnson. On November 22, 1963, Agronsky gave four brief commentaries aggressively supporting the new president. Transcripts of Martin Agronsky’s Commentaries"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 31 During his first commentary, Agronsky mentioned tha t House Speaker John McCormack would be next in line to the presidency i f something would happen to Johnson. That was a reasonably acceptable observati on, although it indicated that Agronsky had thought things through in a moment of crisis; clear thinking indeed. Agronsky’s comment was made only twenty minutes aft er Kennedy’s death had been announced to the world. Here is the transcript: Bill Ryan: The Capitol is now starting to react to what has ha ppened in Dallas, and for a report on that, we go now to Mart in Agronksy, NBC News in Washington. Martin Agronsky: ... Senator Mansfield has made no statement, the Sena te majority leader. Speaker McCormack, who is now in t he position in relation to President Lyndon Johnson that Lyndon Johnson was in relation to President Kennedy, has made no s tatement. ... ( As it Happened , NBC coverage of the Kennedy assassination) An hour later, Agronsky made a second commentary. I n the midst of a national crisis, he told a light-hearted anecdote about Lyndon Johns on and then Texas Governor Connally, who had been shot and gravely wounded whi le riding in the Presidential limousine with Kennedy. Agronsky told how he had be t fifty dollars with Texas Governor John Connally, in 1960, that Lyndon Johnso n would accept the number two spot on the Democratic presidential ticket if Kenne dy offered it to him. According to Agronsky, Connally was certain that Johnson would t urn down the number two position. As it turned out, Connally was wrong abou t his \"close friend,\" Johnson. Possibly Agronsky was merely sharing an innocent, p ersonal encounter with Connally as an attempt to lighten a stressful situation. On the other hand, Agronsky may have been insulating Johnson from charges that Johnson p articipated in a coup against Kennedy. After all, even if Johnson disliked Kenned y; how could he allow his \"good friend\" John Connally to be placed in harm’s way? H ere is the transcript: Agronsky: ... I think back to a night of the convention in nine teen hundred and sixty when Vice-President Lyndon Johnson accept ed the nomination. Governor John Connally was then the flo or manager for Lyndon Johnson. He was the man who was always h is closest assistant in all of his political campaigns. That i s Governor Connally of Texas who now lies wounded in a hospita l in Dallas. About two o’clock in the morning, when there was mu ch talk that Lyndon Johnson would be offered the vice-presidenti al nomination, John Connally told me that he was posit ive he would"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 32 never accept it. I had talked earlier to the late s peaker, to Sam Rayburn. He told me too that Lyndon Johnson would n ever accept the vice-presidency, would never give up the job of Senate majority leader to take it. And I bet John Connally then, fifty dollars that Ly ndon Johnson would take the vice-presidential nomination. And at two o’clock that morning, John Connally made that bet with me, clearly positive that his very close friend, Lyndon Johnson , would not accept it. This I suppose is the way that history i s made. Had Lyndon Johnson not accepted it, he of course would not be president of the United States today. No one could ever have believed or dreamed that a p resident so young would not conclude the term of office, that d eath would interrupt. There is very little else to report here in Washington, just the general reaction from – oh and a bulletin has just come in from Dallas: \"A sniper, armed with a high powered r ifle, murdered President Kennedy today,\" according to the Associat ed Press dispatch, \"barely two hours after President Kennedy ’s death, Lyndon Johnson has taken the oath of office as the thirty-seventh president of the United States.\" So it is President Lyndon Baines Johnson, fifty-fiv e years old, the new president of the United States. Now, back to Ne w York. ( As it Happened , NBC coverage of the Kennedy assassination) About two hours after Kennedy’s death was announced , Agronsky delivered his third commentary. At that point, he stepped up the pro-Jo hnson rhetoric quite a bit. He immediately attempted to cut to film footage of thr ee prominent Senators. Unfortunately there was a \"mechanical failure\" and the audience saw Senator Mansfield’s lips moving, but without sound. Agronsk y apologized for the malfunction, and proceeded to tell what appeared be a bald-faced lie—that the senators were \"rallying\" around the new President Johnson. Later he showed the footage again, in working order, but none of the three even mentioned Johnson by name. In fact, all three senators—Mike Mansfield, Everett Dirksen, and Wayne Morse ( Footnote 7 ) — praised the slain Kennedy and spoke only of the tra gic loss. Morse did state, however, that Americans should \"pray for the president, and pray for the country.\" I assume he meant to pray for President Johnson. Agronsky had planted a seed of disinformation that three prominent senators had quickly rallied around the new President Johnson. A gronsky used this false premise to shower Johnson with praise, stating that Johnson wa s a \"well-known intimate friend of all the members of the Senate of the United Stat es.\" Agronsky also stated that Johnson had \"a more vast governmental experience be hind him than any president we have ever had.\" It looks very much like Agronsky fa ked the mechanical failure which showed Senator Mansfield’s lips moving without soun d as a pretext for building the new president up in the eyes of the American public . This mysterious \"malfunction\""},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 33 allowed Agronsky to make the transition to his obvi ously prepared text which praised President Johnson immensely. Here is the transcript : Agronsky: The leaders of the Congress of the United States ha ve united in bipartisan unity in this tragic moment. Senate majo rity leader Mike Mansfield of Montana, a man who now occupies t he office last held by our new president, Lyndon B. Johnson, his Republican opposite Illinois’ Senator Everett Dirks en, the Republican minority leader in the Senate, and Orego n’s Democratic Wayne Morse speak now. [Video of Senator Mike Mansfield is shown on the sc reen for eighteen seconds, but no sound is heard. Agronsky r eturns and explains the \"mechanical failure.\"] Senator Mansfield was just speaking. Unfortunately, a mechanical failure has cut off the sound from the p icture. We’ll come back with the statements of Senator Mansfield, the majority leader; the minority leader, Senator Everett Dirkse n; and Democratic Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon later. The man around whom they are now rallying, Senator— President Lyndon Baines Johnson is a very, very close friend; a very, very, well-known intimate friend of all of the members of the Senate of the United States. Lyndon Baines Johnson, at the ag e of fifty-five, takes office as president of the United States with probably a more vast governmental experience behind him than a ny president we have ever had. He has been in the Hous e of Representatives for, I think, four terms. He was el ected twice to the Senate of the United States, served as the Sena te majority leader where his record was as an extremely able le gislative leader, a man who accomplished much in the office. His knowledge, his companionship with the members of th e Senate of the United States must certainly serve him in go od stead as they did his predecessor, John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Additionally, throughout the Kennedy administration , then Vice- President Lyndon Johnson, now President Lyndon John son served the president of the United States in many c apacities that gave him an intimate knowledge and insight into the duties of the office that he now assumes. He was on the National Security Council and the National Security Council Executive Committee. He served in every possible way, and had every poss ible experience that a man could have [known] intimately the workings of our government. He is eminently qualifi ed certainly in terms of experience to assume the terrible duties t hat await him"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 34 now. And now we are informed that the mechanical obstruc tion to hearing the words of the Senate leaders has been re moved, and we hear now first from Senator Mansfield of Montana , the majority leader, then from the Republican minority- -[cut to video] [film and voice of Senator Mike Mansfield] The passing of John Fitzgerald Kennedy is not only a tragedy for a nation which he so ably represented, but is I thi nk also a mark upon the respectability and the responsibility of s ome of our citizens. This good, this decent, this kindly man, this harassed man who had so much on his shoulders and received f rom some people, so little in the way of support in return; this man has now gone to his reward. And I will miss him as a person al friend, the nation will miss him as a great president, and the world will miss him as a great leader. [film and voice of Senator Everett Dirksen, sitting beside Mansfield] There are some things that are simply incredible, a nd leave one absolutely speechless. This is one of them. [film and voice of Senator Wayne Morse] In this dark, tragic hour, all I can say is what I said on the floor of the Senate. This is the time for every American to pray. Pray for the president, and pray for the country. [back to Agronsky] So the leaders of the Senate of the United States d emonstrated in these words the traditional and the central unit y that goes beyond party in this particular moment of national tragedy. There can be no doubt that the Congress of the United Sta tes will unite, and unite firmly, and will help in every possible w ay, their new president, Lyndon Baines Johnson. He is their close friend, as his predecessor was; and there is every certainty that the new president of the United States will receive every p ossible help that he possibly can, that can be afforded to him b y the Congress of the United States, regardless of party. The words you have just heard from Mr. Mansfield, t he majority leader; from Senator Everett Dirksen, the minority leader; from Wayne Morse of Oregon, all indicate what is truly a feeling that permeates the entire Congress of the United States today, and demonstrates the kind of essential unity that exist s now in the"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 35 Congress as it rallies behind the new president. And now, back to New York. ( As it Happened , NBC coverage of the Kennedy assassination) Agronsky’s fourth commentary was even more dramatic . At this point, the world had learned of Kennedy’s death slightly less than three hours earlier. Agronsky opened his fourth commentary by mentioning that Kennedy’s cabi net had been on a jet to Japan during the assassination, and had subsequently turn ed around to return home. Amazingly, Agronsky stated that it was traditional for cabinet members of a dead president to automatically submit their resignation s to the new president. One has to ask, Where did Mr. Agronsky find such a piece of tr ivia? After all, presidents don’t die in office that frequently. I doubt that a stand ard protocol had been established. Agronsky was apparently using his power as an opini on leader to allow Johnson to fire some of Kennedy’s cabinet members without crea ting a public controversy. In reality, Johnson kept some of Kennedy’s cabinet mem bers and other advisors, but Agronsky’s spin surely made it easier for a new gov ernment to be assembled. Agronsky then proceeded to heap more praise onto Pr esident Johnson, stating that Kennedy’s cabinet members would surely rally around the highly qualified and respected Johnson. Here is the transcript: Agronsky: The chief members of the cabinet of the United Stat es, that is the Secretary of State, Dean Rusk; the Secretary of Def ense, Mr. Macnamara; the Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Hodges; a nd the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Udall; are all on th e plane [to Japan], that Frank [McGee] has just mentioned, that has tur ned around and is trying to get back now to Washington. It is the custom, it is the tradition when a president dies that each membe r of the cabinet submits automatically his resignation. The incoming president then either accepts the resignation or in structs the cabinet officer to remain at his post. Automaticall y those resignations, we can assume, will be submitted at t his time, and President Johnson will then have to make up his min d whom he wishes to keep and whom he wishes to have go. ... [Agronsky then describes the pending funeral plans for JFK.] The members of the cabinet of course must rally aro und the new president, will, fully intend to, will offer all of the advice that they possibly can. This is a government that under John Fitzgerald Kennedy worked very closely together, not in the se nse of holding frequent cabinet meetings, they didn’t; but everyone else always knew what the other was doing. And Vice-Pres ident Lyndon Johnson, or President Lyndon Johnson—fortuna tely—"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 36 throughout the Kennedy term of office was included in all of the meetings with the cabinet, participated fully in ma ny of the major decisions—the state decisions, was a contributing m ember of the National Security Council, the chief advisory counc il which dealt with all of the great problems of state, and sat at the President’s right hand throughout all the moments of crisis, su ch as the Cuban emergency. He is fully familiar with all of t he duties that he is called upon to assume, and of course will get ev ery kind of help that he possibly can get from the members of t he cabinet. It is much too soon to speculate. No one wishes to, no one is in the mood to speculate as to which members of the ca binet President Johnson will keep, which he will ask to g o. This is a matter that will be decided much later I’m sure whe n the first shock of this terrible tragedy has warn off, and wh en President Johnson begins to function in his new office.

It’s a question now of waiting the arrival of President Lyndon Johnson who will make a statement to the nation when he arrives at the airport which will be in approximately fifty minutes or so from now if all g oes according to schedule. We will hear then the reaction of the new president to the terrible tragedy and to the enormous responsibi lity that has fallen upon his shoulders.

Here is the transcript: Bill Ryan: ... One of the changes will take place in the area of foreign policy. How much? Reported now by NBC state departm ent"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 37 correspondent, Elie Abel, in Washington. Elie Abel: All we can be sure about at the moment is the great shock wave felt around the world, not only among friends and a llies, and neutrals; but also, I suspect, in the Communist rul ed countries. The controlled Soviet press has much of the time be en sharply and automatically critical of US policy; but the pe rson of John F. Kennedy was treated with respect. Just a week ago, the Soviet people were told that [ name unclear], arrested as a spy, was being released because of th e President’s concern over the case. He had met Soviet Premier Kh rushchev in Vienna in 1961, resisted Soviet encroachments on Be rlin, played and won that deadly game of nuclear poker with Khru shchev over Cuba. He was also the man who agreed to a limited test ba n treaty and persuaded the US Senate to ratify that step. The gu ess here is that President Lyndon Johnson will carry on much th e same policy. He was certainly very much directly involve d in that policy. He showed the flag in many distant parts of the wor ld as President Kennedy’s personal emissary. But just as the Western allies may hesitate while p ledging full support to the new president, the Soviets presumabl y are not sure at the moment what to expect out of Washington . They have tended to place a certain faith in John Kennedy per sonally as a man they disagreed with, but a man who wanted peace . He was trying to defuse some of the explosive situations a round the world, who favored in the long run a policy based o n mutual recognition that nuclear war is no rational option for mankind in this day and age. The Russians know less about Lyndon Johnson, and th ey may well play a waiting game until they have a surer fe el of his reactions and attitudes. Elie Abel, NBC News, repor ting.

He was a graduate of McGill University and began his career in journalism at the Montreal Gazette in 1941. Another NBC Jewish correspondent, Irving R. Levine, also had an interesting background. Levine covered the violence that marked independence of the Islamic nation of Algeria. 2 As previously stated, Senator John F. Kennedy made a controversial speech in 1957 denouncing France for its occupation of Algeria. To put"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 38 it bluntly, Kennedy’s Algerian speech was not only a criticism of French policy, it was also a slap in the face to Israel and an endors ement of the Islamic states. Martin Agronsky’s conduct was by far the most aggre ssive of the Jewish correspondents at NBC, but it was merely the tip of the iceberg. As previously stated, immediately after Kennedy’s assassination, an Oswal d cover story was put out by the Dallas Police—and propagated by the Associated Pres s wire service—to confuse the public about the true nature of the crime. The cove r story portrayed Lee Harvey Oswald as the lone assassin, that he was a known Co mmunist, was pro-Castro, had lived in the Soviet Union, and was married to a Rus sian woman. NBC’s televised coverage of the assassination actually broadcast al l of these details less than two hours after announcing Kennedy’s death. Within that times pan, they also mentioned that Oswald had applied for Soviet citizenship on Novemb er 1, 1959. That was quite impressive detective work indeed.

Officer Tippit had been killed by a man answering t he description of Oswald in the neighborhood a short time before. A coincidence in the case is that Oswald worked as a stock man at the Texas Book Depository, the building from which the sniper shot President Kennedy.

The y looked like a swarm of locusts descending upon a cornfield. Witho ut any discussion, they encircled the casket and began esc orting the President's body down the hall toward the emergency room exit.

Just outside T rauma Room 1, Jacqueline joined the escort and placed her hand on the coffin as she walked along beside it. I followed directly beh ind them. When the entourage had moved into the main hall, Dr . Earl Rose, chief of forensic pathology, confronted the men in suits.

Garrison suggested in his book, On the Trail of the Assassins , that Shaw received instructions from Louis M. Bloomfield. 1 In addition, Garrison discovered that Shaw and Bloomfield were board members of two trade organiza tions, Permindex and Centro Mondiale Commerciale , both expelled from Italy in 1962 for subversive i ntelligence activity. 2 Clay Shaw was a tall distinguished man with silver hair and a polished manner; born in Kentwood, Louisiana on March 17, 1913. During th e 1930s, he worked in New York City as an executive for Western Union Telegra ph Company and later as an advertising public-relations consultant. By 1963 Sh aw had become a wealthy real estate developer in New Orleans. He was director of the International House—the World Trade Center, a \"nonprofit association foster ing the development of international trade, tourism and cultural exchange. \" 3 Researcher Jim Marrs wrote in his renowned book abo ut the Kennedy assassination, Crossfire , the following description of Shaw’s military back ground: By 1941, Shaw was with the U.S. Army and, while his official biography states simply that he was an aide-de-camp to General Charles O. Thrasher, Shaw later admitted he was wor king for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) as a liaison off icer to the headquarters of Winston Churchill. It was here that Shaw may have become entangled in the murky world of intelli gence. Although there is precious little reliable informat ion on exactly what Shaw’s wartime experiences included, he did re tire from the U.S. Army in 1946 as a major—later he was made a co lonel— with the Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit, France’s Croix de Guerre, and Belgium’s Order of the Crown. 4 It is significant that Shaw received France’s Croix de Guerre while serving as a Colonel in the US Army in the 1940s. There is stron g circumstantial evidence that Shaw may have also served as a Colonel in the Frenc h espionage organization, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre Es pionage (SDECE), under the aliases of a Colonel René Bertrand and Colonel Beau mont. This would tie Shaw directly to professional assassin Christian David w ho revealed in the late 1980s that French Corsican assassins were hired to kill Presid ent. Jim Garrison proved that Clay Shaw often used alias es Clay Bertrand or Clem Bertrand. Danish journalist, Henrik Krüger, wrote i n his 1976 book, The Great Heroin Coup , that a Colonel René Bertrand, alias Colonel Beaum ont, worked for SDECE in the 1940s. According to Krüger, Colonel Bertrand us ed his influence in 1949 to get French gangster Jo Attia’s prison sentence reduced from life to four years. Attia had"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 46 been convicted in France for illegal possession of weapons and involvement in the death/murder of another gangster, Pierrot le Fou. A ttia had saved Colonel Bertrand’s life during World War II and evidently asked Bertra nd to return the favor by getting his sentence reduced. 5 Jo Attia was one of France’s most colorful criminal s, and was the first gangster in that country to become an international spy. It was Jo A ttia who, according to Krüger, introduced heroin trafficker Christian David to int ernational espionage. Jo Attia also worked with French Corsican crime family, the Gueri ni brothers. 6 Christian David told an interviewer—in Nigel Turner's documentary, The Men Who Killed Kennedy — that Antoine Guerini, of the Guerini crime family, offered him the contract to kill President Kennedy; but David refused because it was too dangerous. Christian David and Jo Attia were both involved in the 1965 kidnapp ing and murder of Moroccan political activist Mehdi Ben Barka. They were also closely associated with, according to Henrik Krüger, the men who killed Patrice Lumumb a of the Congo. 7 Given that Clay Shaw was a Colonel in the US Army i n the late 1940s, that he admitted to working for the OSS, and given that he was awarded France’s Croix de Guerre , and given that Shaw resided in New Orleans which has a strong French heritage, and given Shaw’s known propensity to use aliases, it is possible that French SDECE officer, Colonel René Bertrand, alias Beaumon t, was actually Colonel Clay Shaw. This \"missing link\" about Shaw’s background c onnects the dots to many of Jim Garrison’s discoveries about Shaw’s past, his links to international espionage, and his involvement in the assassination of President Kenne dy. In addition, Henrik Krüger wrote that Colonel Bertrand, alias Beaumont, is one of the names most associated with SDECE espionage involving assassination, kidna pping, and other notorious scandals. 8 Dean Anderson Linked Clay Shaw to Oswald A major discovery in Garrison’s investigation was l inking Clay Shaw to Lee Harvey Oswald per the testimony of New Orleans attorney De an Andrews. Garrison had known Andrews well for years. They went to Tulane L aw School together, although they did not attend the same classes. They both pra cticed law in New Orleans for years, although Garrison was the District Attorney and Andrews had a private practice. 9 Andrews told FBI and the Warren Commission that a \" Clay Bertrand\" had contacted him on November 23, 1963 to provide legal represent ation to accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald. Clay Bertrand turned out to be an al ias used by Clay Shaw. Jim Garrison wrote the following description of stateme nts made by Andrews to the authorities: In my reading I had learned that, at the time of hi s first FBI interview shortly after the assassination, [Dean] A ndrews had described Clay Bertrand, his New Orleans caller, as a man approximately six feet two in height. He had gone o n to say that"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 47 Bertrand was a man who called him from time to time to help young friends of his who had become involved in min or scrapes with the law. Then—and later in more detail—he expl ained that in the summer of 1963, when Lee Oswald was living in N ew Orleans, Bertrand had called him and asked him to h elp Oswald with some citizenship problems his wife, Marina, wa s having. Oswald, consequently, had met with Andrews several times in his office. It had readily become apparent to me, however, that the more Andrews realized that his having received a phone c all to defend Lee Oswald was a potential danger to him, the foggi er the identity of Clay Bertrand became in his mind. By the time An drews appeared before the Warren Commission in July 1964, Bertrand’s height had shrunk from six feet two all the way down to five feet eight inches. Apparently in response t o subtle pressure from the FBI agents, Andrews told them, \"W rite what you want, that I am nuts. I don’t care.\" The agents obligingly wrote in their final report that Andrews had come t o the conclusion that the phone call from Bertrand had be en \"a figment of his imagination.\" This not only allowed the Bure au to conclude its investigation into Andrews but harmonized with its announced conclusion that Lee Oswald had accomplished Kennedy ’s assassination alone and unaided. (Jim Garrison, On the Trail of the Assassins , pp. 92 - 93) 10 Garrison read Andrews’ multiple testimonies in the volumes of the Warren Report. In early 1967, he decided to meet Andrews for lunch at Broussard’s Restaurant (in New Orleans). This is their exchange as documented by G arrison in his book, On the Trail of the Assassins , later depicted almost verbatim in Oliver Stone’s famous movie, JFK : Andrews: We’ve been friends since law school days. Why do yo u want to treat me like I have leprosy? Garrison: Because you keep conning me, Dean. You admitted to the Warren Commission that on the day after the assassi nation— while you were a patient at Hotel Dieu hospital—you were called on the phone and asked to fly to Dallas and to be L ee Oswald’s lawyer. When the Warren Commission asked you the ca ller’s name, you replied that it was ‘Clay Bertrand.’ Andrews:"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 48 That’s right. Garrison: Now, when I tell you I want to know who Clay Bertra nd is, you tell me he’s a client of yours but you really don’t know what he looks like because you never see him.

They were Mexi canos. He wanted to find out what could be done in connection with a discharge, a yellow paper discharge, so I explained to him he would have to advance the funds to transcribe whate ver records they had up in the Adjutant General's office. When he brought the money, I would do the work, and we saw him three or four times subsequent to that, not in the company of the gay k ids. He had this Mexicano with him.

Under oath, Andrews identified Clay Bertrand as the man who phoned him requesting legal representation for Oswald. Later it became known that Clay Bertrand was actual ly Clay Shaw, who was linked to international espionage activities with Louis Bloom field, one of Israel’s most influential supporters. Obviously Andrews had reaso n to fear serious reprisal if he revealed to the authorities that Clay Bertrand was in fact Clay Shaw. This is why he clearly backpedaled regarding Bertrand’s height and was eventually convicted of perjury for lying about the true identity of Clay S haw, the man who had asked him to represent Lee Harvey Oswald for the murder of Presi dent Kennedy. Garrison Proved That Shaw and Bertrand Were the Sam e Person Although Garrison lost the conspiracy case against Shaw, he proved in a separate proceeding that Clay Bertrand and Clay Shaw were in fact the same person. 11 In subsequent testimony before a grand jury in Louisia na, Andrews denied that Clay Bertrand and Clay Shaw were the same person. The gr and jury responded by convicting Andrews of perjury. Subsequently, in Aug ust 1967, Andrews was found guilty of perjury by a jury of New Orleans citizens . 12 As a result, Andrews was sentenced to five months in the Parish prison. 13 The stated perjury conviction linked Bloomfield directly to Oswald because Shaw was obvi ously Oswald’s handler, and Shaw and Bloomfield were linked to subversive intel ligence activity via Permindex and Centro Mondiale Commerciale. Garrison Linked Clay Shaw to Louis Bloomfield To my knowledge, Jim Garrison was the first to expo se Louis Bloomfield, Centro Mondiale Commerciale, Permindex, and Clay Shaw’s as sociation with them. This is what Garrison wrote in his book, On the Trail of the Assassins : It was not until much later, well after the Shaw tr ial when it could have been of any use to us, that we discovered Shaw ’s extensive international role as an employee of the CIA. Shaw’ s secret life as an Agency man in Rome trying to bring Fascism ba ck to Italy was exposed in articles in the Italian press which we obtained from Ralph Schoenmann, secretary to philosopher Ber trand Russell, who had been one of the earliest supporter s of our investigation. According to these articles, the CIA—which apparent ly had been conducting its own foreign policy for some time—had begun a project in Italy as far back as the early 1960s. Th e organization, named the Centro Mondiale Commerciale (the World Tr ade"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 58 Center), had initially been formed in Montreal, the n moved to Rome in 1961. Among the members of its board of dir ectors, we learned, was one Clay Shaw from New Orleans. The Centro Montiale Commerciale’s new headquarters, according to the Roman press, was elegant. Its publ icity, announcing the new, creative role it was going to p lay in world trade, was impressive. The Centro opened an additio nal office in Switzerland, also an impressive move. However, in 1967, the Italian press took a close lo ok at the board of directors of the Centro Mondiale Commerciale and found it consisted of a very curious collection of individua ls. The board contained at least one genuine prince, Gutierrez di Spadaforo, a member of the House of Savoy, whence came Umberto, the last of Italy’s kings. Spadaforo, a man of considerable wealth, with extensive holdings in armaments and petroleum, had once been the undersecretary of agriculture for Il Duce, Beni to Mussolini. Through his daughter-in-law, Spadaforo was related to the famous Nazi minister of finance, Hjalmar Schacht, w ho had been tried for war crimes in Nuremberg. Another director of the Centro was Carlo D’Amelio, the lawyer for other members of the former Italian royal family. A nother was Ferenc Nagy, the exiled former premier of Hungary a nd the former head of the leading anti-Communist political party. Nagy also was described by the Italian newspapers as the president of Permindex (ostensibly a foundation for a permanent exposition and an offshoot of the Centro Mondiale Commerciale) . Nagy, the Italian newspapers said, had been a heavy contribut or to Fascist movements in Europe. Yet another director was a man named Giuseppi Zigiotti, the president of something with the congenial title of Fascist National Association of Militia Ar ms. One of the major stockholders of the Centro was a M ajor L.M. Bloomfield, a Montreal resident originally of Ameri can nationality and a former agent with the Office of Strategic Ser vices, out of which the United States had formed the CIA. This then was the general makeup of the Centro Mond iale Commerciale, on whose board of directors Clay Shaw served. Judging from the background of its members and the fairly heavy activities in which they were engaged, the organiza tion could not be confused with the Shriners or the 4-H Club. The Centro was described in 1969 by writer Paris Flammonde in The Kennedy Conspiracy as apparently representative of the para military right in Europe, including Italian Fascists, the American CIA, and similar interests. He described it as \"a shell of superficiality...composed of channels through which m oney"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 59 flowed back and forth, with no one knowing the sour ces or the destination of these liquid assets.\" The Italian government had no problem distinguishin g the organization from the Shriners and the 4-H Club. Be fore 1962 was out, it had expelled the Centro Mondiale Commer ciale—and its half-brother, Permindex—from Italy for subversi ve intelligence activity. Perhaps because of its Montreal origin, the Centro aroused the interest of a Canadian newspaper, Le Devoir. Referr ing to Ferenc Nagy, one of the Centro’s director’s it wrote in ea rly 1967: \"Nagy...maintains close ties with the CIA which link him with the Miami Cuban colony.\" Nagy subsequently emigrated to the United States, making himself at home in Dallas, Te xas. With regard to Major Bloomfield, Le Devoir observed that although now ostensibly a Canadian, he had been inv olved in \"espionage\" in earlier years for the United States government. It went on to point out that Bloomfield was not only a shareholder of the Centro but of its affiliate group, Permindex, a s well. Summing up the fate of the two related enterprises, Le Devoir stated: \"Whatever the case may be, the Centro Comme rciale and Permindex got into difficulties with the Italian an d Swiss governments. They refused to testify to origins of considerable amounts of money, and they never seem to engage in actual commercial transactions. These companies were expel led from Switzerland and Italy in 1962 and then set up headq uarters in Johannesburg.\" The ultimate evaluation of Clay Shaw’s Centro Mondi ale Commerciale by the Paesa Sera stated: \"Among its po ssible involvements (supported by the presence in directiv e posts of men deeply committed to organizations of the extrem e right)...is that the Center was the creature of the CIA...set up as a cover for the transfer of CIA...funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities. It still remains to clear up the presen ce on the administrative Board of the Center of Clay Shaw and ex-Major (of the OSS) Bloomfield.\" Paesa Sera made an additional observation about the Centro. It was, the newspaper observed, \"the point of contact for a number of persons who, in certain respects, have somewhat equivocal ties whose common denomination is anti-communism so strong that it would swallow up all those in the world who have fought for decent relations between East and West, including K ennedy.\" That just happened, as well, to be the trenchant on e-line description of the parent organization, the Central Intelligence"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 60 Agency. As for Permindex, which Clay Shaw also served as a director, the Italian press revealed that it had , among other th ings, secretly financed the opposition of the French Secret Army O rganization (OAS) to President de Gaulle’s support for independ ence for Algeria, including its reputed assassination attemp ts on de Gaulle. (Jim Garrison, On the Trail of the Assassins , pp. 100-103) Garrison’s citing from Paris Flammonde’s book, The Kennedy Conspiracy , seems highly significant given what we have learned about Auguste Ricord’s involvement in the Kennedy assassination. Flammonde wrote that Cen tro Montiale Commerciale was \"a shell of superficiality...composed of channels thr ough which money flowed back and forth, with no one knowing the sources or the d estination of these liquid assets.\" The money Flammonde described was likely not genera ted by the CIA, the US government or any government per se. It was probabl y the profits from the illicit sale of heroin produced from opium grown in the Golden T riangle; hence, the Vietnam connection. This money was likely laundered by Cent ro and Permindex and distributed to all participants in a criminal enter prise which included drug traffickers, the CIA, Mossad, SDECE, and a host of other intelli gence services. Involvement of French Corsican heroin traffickers i n the Kennedy assassination also explains the presence of ex-Nazis and European fasc ists on the board of directors of Centro and Permindex even though both agencies were headed by a highly influential Jewish friend of Israel, Louis Bloomfield. Many Fre nch Corsican underworld figures like Auguste Ricord were Nazi collaborators during World War II. Such alliances were formed primarily for convenience rather than p olitical ideology. The mobsters were merely co-existing with the ruling power in Fr ance at the time. They dealt with Nazis and Jews alike if the alliances fulfilled the ir business plans. In that sense the mobsters were—and are—equal opportunity employers. This mindset is nothing new in the underworld culture. Permindex Funded Assassination Attempts on de Gaull e In 1962, French president Charles de Gaulle publicl y accused Permindex of channeling money to OAS (Secret Army Organization), 14 which made several attempts on de Gaulle’s life for liberating Algeria . Keep in mind that \"Senator\" John Kennedy publicly denounced France, in 1957, for its colonial rule over Algeria and for the brutality exhibited in the French-Algerian War. 15 It appears that Permindex may have financed the 196 5 kidnapping and murder of Moroccan exile leader Mehdi Ben Barka as well. 16 When Morocco and Algeria had a brief war in 1963, Ben Barka sided with Algeria and went into exile. 17 This is highly significant because it establishes an even stronger pattern that any head of state who openly supported Algerian independence was assassin ated—or an assassination was"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 61 attempted—by Israel via Permindex. De Gaulle, Kenne dy, and Ben Barka all supported an independent Algeria. Israel’s objectiv e was apparently to keep all Islamic nations oppressed. Danish journalist Henrik Krüger asserted in his 197 6 book, The Great Heroin Coup , that Christian David was involved in the kidnapping and murder of Ben Barka. 18 American journalists Evert Clark and Nicholas Horro ck made a similar suggestion in their 1973 book, Contrabandista . 19 All three writers agree that David was wanted for murdering French policeman Lieutenant Maurice Galib ert—on February 2, 1966— who was investigating the Ben Barka affair. 20 As previously stated in this Chapter, there is strong circumstantial evidence that Clay S haw may have established a relationship with Christian David from contacts Sha w made with the Guerini brothers—a French Corsican crime family—during Shaw ’s World War II intelligence service with the French intelligence agency SPECE u sing the aliases Colonel René Bertrand and Colonel Beaumont.

Bloomfield was an extraordinary individual in the sense that he operated behind the scenes influencing the highest echelons of power within many countries. He was a prominent Jewish philanthropist in Canada and Israel, 1 a well connected international lawyer, 2 a spy, 3 a soldier, 4 and a diplomat, 5 all rolled into one human being. A declassified document from the State Depar tment described Bloomfield as \"intense, more inclined to talk than to listen, but polite—almost courtly.\" 6 "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 63 I do not know if Bloomfield is still alive; however , he would be somewhere between ninety-three and ninety-seven years old as of this writing (2002).

Here i s that forward in its entirety: In 1902 my late father, Harry Bloomfield, and his b rothers made a pilgrimage from Canada to Palestine. As small boys my brother and I never tired of hearing his stories of the Hol y Land, and when he died of influenza during the epidemic in 19 18, we resolved, young as we were, to keep alive his devot ion to the ancient homeland of the Jews. The years that followed were exciting ones. The [Br itish] Mandate; the gradual dismemberment of the National Home to a quarter of its original area; the riots; the variou s Commissions culminating in the U.N.S.C.O.P.; partition; the Ame rican volt face; the Declaration of the State of Israel; the Arab in vasions; bloody battles and ultimate victory. The sacrifices of the Jews in Israel, the stirring and excitement accompanying the birth of the New State, the first painful stages of its growth, created in us a strong desire to see this phenomenon on the spot. On March 12, 1949, in a blinding snowstorm that del ayed our departure several hours while the runaways were bei ng cleared, we took off from Montreal’s Dorval Airport. Our jou rney to Israel was circuitous. My brother is an international lawy er and had certain matters to attend to en route. So we travel ed via London, Gibraltar, Tangier, Madrid, Rome, Athens and Nicosi a. On March 28 our plane landed at Haifa. We traveled extensive ly throughout Israel from Dan to Beersheba, and, through the cour tesy of the Israeli Army, across the Southern Negev Desert over the Scorpion’s Ladder with the first convoy of newspape rmen and photographers to reach the Gulf of Aqaba since the war’s end. I am a businessman and had never written for public ation. My wife is an ardent Zionist (her grandmother was a de legate to the"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 64 Second Congress at Basle in 1898), and wanting her to share my soul-stirring experiences in Israel, I wrote to her at length as I saw, heard, and thought. These letters, together wi th detailed notes I kept of our travels, form the basis of this diary. Its transformation into a book is due, in great measure , to the painstaking help and encouragement of my friend Abe Goldberg and my brother Louis. On the barren, eroded slopes of Neve Ilan, a French Maquis kibbutz in the Jerusalem Corridor, Louis and I plan ted, one bright spring morning, the Bloomfield Memorial Forest, in honor of the man who taught us to be loyal Canadians and good Je ws. We planted it in territory allotted to the Arabs under the Partition Plan, but won by the Jews after bitter fighting and many casualties. We did it as a symbol that this ground, stained by the blood of our heroes, must ever remain in Jewish hands. (B. Bloomfield, Israel Diary , pp. ix & x) Bloomfield, the Jewish Philanthropist As a Jewish philanthropist, Louis Bloomfield worked extensively with his brother, Bernard. They built the Bloomfield Stadium 9 in Tel Aviv which hosts Israeli and international soccer games even today. They also bu ilt the Sir Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General Hospital 10 in Montreal. I suspect that Sir Mortimer B. Davis was an uncle or other close relative of the Bloomfield bro thers. It is worth noting that Bloomfield’s mother’s maiden name was Sadie Davis. 11 Obviously, Bernard and Louis Bloomfield admired Davis a great deal since t hey named a hospital after him. In addition, Louis’ parents, Harry and Sadie, may have given Louis the same middle name, Mortimer, as Sir Davis. Sir Mortimer Barnett Davis was a whisky supplier to Sam Bronfman during prohibition. 12 Davis also made a fortune in the tobacco business. 13 He owned the Canadian Industrial Alcohol Company and operated Co rby and Wiser distilleries. 14 If Louis Bloomfield was in fact the nephew of Sir Mort imer Davis—the bootlegger and business associate of Sam Bronfman from the prohibi tion period, this would indeed explain Bloomfield’s extraordinary influence and po wer. In 1971, Louis and Bernard Bloomfield built a stude nt union building, named the Bloomfield Center, at Saint Francis Xavier Universi ty in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada. 15 In addition, Louis and Bernard Bloomfield were pri ncipals in Israel’s labor union, Histadrut . 16 In 1967, Louis Bloomfield was given a Histadrut aw ard for \"outstanding work in aid of pioneering Israel.\" 17 Previous recipients of the Histadrut award included Sam Bronfman, Arthur Goldberg, Harry Truman, and Eleanor Roosevelt. 18 "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" 65 Criticism of Histadrut by an Israeli Intellectual In my research, I found an article by a highly qual ified and disinterested source, Dr. Steven Plout, a senior lecturer in economics and bu siness at the University of Haifa. In his article, Plout asserted that Histadrut is nothing more than organized crime in Israel. Plout wrote the following: The main body of organized crime in Israel is an in stitution called the Histadrut. It is often thought that the Histadr ut is the Israeli version of the AFL-CIO in the US or the TUC in the UK, but it is in many ways more closely related to the Corleone crim e family. . . . The fact is that the Labor Party is behaving like t hose sandbox brats who say that if they cannot own the toy they will bust it, and if they cannot be in power in Israel, they will max imize the damage to the country by Histadrut syndicalism and Bolshevism.

Mr. Bloomfield received numerous honorary degrees, the Queen Elizabeth Medal and was made Grand Commander of the Star of Africa. The Queen honored him with the Order of the Knight of Justice and the Most Venerable Order of the Hospita l of St. John of Jerusalem. ( The Globe and Mail , newspaper, Toronto, Ontario; September 1, 1984) Bloomfield, the International Lawyer and Author As a lawyer, Louis Bloomfield was an expert on inte rnational boundary disputes. 19 In 1968, he was urged by the US State Department to go to Belize to learn about the situation there. 20 At that time, Belize was struggling for independen ce from Great Britain. 21 In 1970, Bloomfield was an unpaid advisor to the o pposition party in British Honduras. He authored at least three books on inter national law: The British Hondurus Guatemala Dispute (1953), Egypt, Israel and the Gulf of Aqaba (1957), and Crimes Against Internationally Protected Persons (1975). The latter book was co- authored with Gerald F. FitzGerald. In addition, Bl oomfield was a member of the committee that drafted the Helsinki Rules of the Uses of the Waters of Interna tional Rivers (1966). 22 Bloomfield’s Work at Phillips and Vineberg, a Montr eal Law Firm Bloomfield worked for years at the law firm of Phil lips and Vineberg in Montreal. 23 The firm’s founder, Lazarus Phillips, was a persona l friend of Sam Bronfman. 24 Phillips and Vineberg handled most of Bronfman’s le gal and financial affairs. 25 In 1968 Phillips was appointed to the Canadian Senate, 26 a position that Bronfman had sought but never gained. The political ambitions of Phillips had created a rift between the two men years earlier, but Phillips and Vineber g continued handling Bronfman’s affairs anyway; however, most of the work was done by Phillips’ partner and nephew, Philip Vineberg. 27 Today Phillips’ law firm—now Goodman, Phillips, Vi neberg—is one of the most prestigious international law firms in Canada. It is significant that Phillips and Vineberg opened a law firm in Paris in 1961. 28 This is important because it gave Bloomfield a legal pre sence near Marseilles, France, the heart of worldwide heroin production by the French Corsican underworld. Marseilles was also the city where professional assassins were recruited to kill Kennedy. Bloomfield, the Haganah Soldier Trained by General Wingate"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 67 As a spy and soldier, Bloomfield was first and fore most a Jew, a Zionist, and one of the principal founders of the modern Jewish state o f Israel. On May 4th, 1949, he and his brother Bernard, met Israeli Prime Minister Dav id Ben-Gurion at a garden party, hosted by Ben-Gurion, in celebration of Israel’s fi rst birthday. 29 At the age of about thirty-three, Bloomfield sought to help fulfill his father’s dream of establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine. 30 He joined the British military and served in Palestine as an Intelligence Officer unde r General Charles Orde Wingate. 31 Bloomfield and Wingate trained the Jewish army, Hag anah, from 1936 through 1939, during the Arab Revolt. 32 The British—who controlled Palestine at that time and had supported the Zionist movement under the British Ma ndate—were caught off-guard by massive Arab resistance. The British responded b y sending more than 20,000 troops into Palestine. 33 Bloomfield was one of those soldiers. To counter the onslaught of Arab attacks, General W ingate and Bloomfield trained Special Night Squads, comprised primarily of Hagana h fighters, the illegal Jewish army. 34 Their tactics were based on the strategic principl es of surprise, mobility, and night attacks, and they served effectively both as defensive and offensive units, successfully pre-empting and resisting Arab attacks . 35 By 1939 Wingate, Bloomfield and fellow Zionists had armed more than 15,000 Jews to defend the Zionist nationalist movement in Palestine. 36 Wingate was killed in an airplane crash in Burma i n 1944, and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Vir ginia. 37 When the O.S.S. was formed in the early 1940s, Bloomfield was recruited and given the rank of major. 38 More Espionage In 1947, the O.S.S. evolved into the CIA, and Bloom field continued doing contract work for them as well as the State Department/CIA t hrough 1970. 39 There is circumstantial evidence suggesting that Bl oomfield and Clay Shaw (using the aliases of Colonel René Bertrand and Colonel Beaume nt in the French spy agency, SDECE) solicited Antoine Guerini—leader of the Guerini Family , the top French- Corsican Mafia at Marseilles, France—to hire hit me n to assassinate President Kennedy. 40 The Guerini Family had extensive ties to the CIA s ince the late 1940s. 41 The men Antoine Guerini selected later became the l ieutenants for Auguste Ricord. Their names were Lucien Sarti, François Chiappe, an d Jean-Paul Angeletti. Guerini asked a fourth man to participate as well, but he r efused. His name was Christian David. Like the other three assassins, David later became one of Auguste Ricord’s top lieutenants. 42 The relationships between Sarti, Chiappe, Angelett i, David, and Ricord were documented by Evert Clark and Nicholas Horrock in their 1973 book, Contrabandista . Using the Paris law office of Phillips and Vineberg as a front, 43 Bloomfield was able to manage the legal affairs of the French-Corsican underworld figures and to set up European bank accounts—via Permindex—to launder ill icit heroin profits.

Rivele presented information that he obtained fro m interviewing French-Corsican hit man, heroin trafficker, and int ernational spy, Christian David. According to David, the contract to kill President Kennedy originated in Marseilles, France by Antoine Guerini, leader of the Corsican M afia in that city. Three hit men were hired—all members of the Corsican Mafia. Accor ding to David, the hit men were flown out of Dallas, after the assassination, to Montreal. From Montreal they were flown by private plane back to Marseilles, Fra nce. I found David’s account to be plausible because of the Montreal connection. After all, Louis Bloomfield, his brother Bernard, and Sam Bronfman all lived in that city. Equally intriguing, David’s description of the shot s fired at President was different from anything I had read or heard before. David lea rned from the gunmen that there were \"three guns, four shots, three hits, one miss. \" Kennedy was hit twice: once in the back/neck and once in the head. Connally was hit on ce, but the single bullet apparently caused five wounds in his body. A fourth shot missed the car completely. In addition, two shots were fired almost simultaneo usly. This explains why so many witnesses stated that they only heard three shots. David had aroused my curiosity. I got a copy of the Zapruder film and began studying it, comparing it with David’s description. Amazingl y, his description matched the film completely. Even more astonishing, David’s descript ion was completely different from that of acclaimed pathologist, Dr. Cyril Wecht , who also appeared in The Men Who Killed Kennedy . It became clear that Christian David was a man to be taken seriously, even if Dr. Wecht was not. I will critiq ue Dr. Wecht’s analysis later. At the moment, however, we will focus on the assassination of President Kennedy from the viewpoint of Christian David, as told to researcher Steve Rivele. Transcript of Rivele’s Interview From The Men Who K illed Kennedy The following is a transcript of Steve Rivele’s res earch as presented in the documentary, The Men Who Killed Kennedy : Steve Rivele: ... The initial turning point was the first meeting t hat I had with the French narcotics trafficker at Leavenworth Penitent iary. His name was Christian David [pronounced Dah-veed]. He had b een a member of the old French Connection heroin network. He had then been a leader of the Corsican drug trafficking network in South America known as the Latin Connection. And he had also been an intelligence agent for a number of intellig ence services around the world. In exchange for my help in findin g him an"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 72 attorney to represent him against the possibility o f his deportation to France after he finished his sentence at Leavenw orth, he agreed to give me a certain amount of information c oncerning the assassination based upon his own knowledge. The fir st thing that he told me, very reluctantly and only after four or five hours of my arguing with him, was that he was aware that there had been a conspiracy to murder the president, and indeed in M ay or June of 1963 in Marseilles [France], he had been offered th e contract to kill President Kennedy. That was the initial breakt hrough, if you will. He was eventually deported to France. I remai ned in contact with him. I went to Paris to interview him in two p risons in Paris. And in the fear that he would be either committed t o an asylum or that he would be convicted of an old murder charge, he gradually gave me additional information about the assassinat ion. NOTE: The \"old murder charge\" was the murder of Fre nch policeman Lieutenant Maurice Galibert on February 2, 1966. 1 Galibert had been investigating the kidnapping and murder of Moroccan political exile, Mehdi Ben Barka, and David was the prime suspect. 2 Rivele (continued): [David’s] position was that there were three killer s, and that they had been hired on a contract which had been placed with the leader of the Corsican Mafia at Marseilles, a man n amed Antoine Guerini. Guerini, he said, was asked to supply thre e assassins of high quality, experienced killers to murder the Pre sident, and that Guerini did so. In the course of one of the first s ignificant conversations I had with David on this subject, he told me that he had been in Marseilles in May or June of 1963, and that every evening he went to Antoine Guerini’s club on the ol d Port of Marseilles to meet people who owed him money. And o ne evening, Guerini sent for him, asked him to come to the office which was above the club. Guerini told him that he had an important contract, and he asked David if he were i nterested. David said, \"Who’s the contract on?\" Guerini said, \"an American politician.\" David asked, \"Well is it a congressman , a senator?\" And Guerini said, \"higher than that... The highest ve getable.\" At that point of course David knew who he was talking about. David asked him where was the contract to be carried out. And when Guerini said it would be done inside the United Sta tes, David refused on the grounds that that was much too dange rous. Now David initially would only give me the first na me of one of the three men on the grounds that two of the three were still alive and since they were members of this Corsican milieu , which has a code of silence and a code of vendetta, if he nam ed them, he himself would be murdered. However, he did agree to give me"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" 73 the first name of the third man who he said was dea d. And that man he said was named \"Lucien.\" I then spent a grea t deal of time in Paris and Marseilles trying to find out who this Lucien was. And through contacts that I made in the journa listic and police and intelligence communities, I was able to determine that this Lucien was in fact a Corsican drug trafficker and killer of the 1960s and 70s by the name of Lucien Sarti. Sarti ha d been killed in Mexico City in 1972. I confronted David with the name of Sarti, and he i n effect confirmed that that was the man he had referred to. He was an extremely reckless, very daring man, known and desp ised even by his colleagues for taking enormous chances. But that same recklessness made him one of the most successful co ntract killers and drug traffickers of his era. [Narrator’s voice:] Having identified Sarti, Christian David, fearing f or his life, refused to name the other two assassins recruited t o kill Kennedy. Nonetheless, in successive interviews, he slowly began to reveal how the contract placed ... in Marseilles, had been carried out. Steve Rivele: In the fall of 1963, the three killers were flown f rom Marseilles to Mexico City where they spent some three or four wee ks at the house of a contact in Mexico City. He said that the y were then driven from Mexico City to the US border at Brownsv ille, Texas. They crossed the border using Italian passports. He said that they were picked up on the American side of the bor der at Brownsville by a representative of the Chicago Mafi a with whom they conversed in Italian. They were then driven to Dallas and put up in a safehouse which had been prepared for them so as not to leave any hotel records. He said that they spent se veral days taking photographs of Dealey Plaza, and in the even ings at the safehouse they studied the photographs and they arr anged what he called a crossfire with three guns. On the question of the actual murder, he was reason ably specific that two of the assassins were in buildings behind the President’s limousine. He did not know which buildings. However , he did specify that one was high and one was low. In fact he said ...[in French]... \"almost on the horizontal.\" And he went on to add, \"You can’t understand the wounds unless you underst and that one of the men was almost on the horizontal.\""},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" 74 NOTE: I interpreted Christian David’s comments abou t \"the horizontal\" to mean that one of the assassins fired at Kennedy from behind o n the ground level, likely from the Dal-Tex Building. When David stated that \"You can’t understand the wounds unless you understand that one of the men was almost on th e horizontal,\" it seems that he was suggesting that Kennedy’s neck wound was caused by a gunman firing from the ground level. As I stated before, the bullet that h it Kennedy in the neck probably entered the back of the neck and exited the front. Again, this is corroborated somewhat by Connally’s immediate reaction—which was captured on the Zapruder film—when he turned and looked behind after hearing the first shot. Rivele (continued): In a separate conversation with David, I asked him based upon what I knew about Sarti’s penchant for changing his appearance, whether Sarti had ever said anything to him about h aving worn a disguise. And David said, \"What do you mean by a di sguise?\" I asked him, \"Did Sarti ever indicate that he wore cl othing other than he normally would have worn?\" And David though t about it for a moment and said, \"He wore a uniform.\" I asked him what kind of uniform and he refused to answer. But he di d add that on jobs like this, they were always in disguise. He sa id if, for example, there were a military post nearby, they wo uld dress in military uniforms. He said that there were four shots; that the first shot was fired from the rear and struck the president in the back. The second shot was also fired from the rear, and as David sai d, \"hit the other man in the car.\" The third shot was fired by Sarti from the front, struck the President in the head; and the fourth sh ot was fired from the rear and missed the automobile entirely. S o his scenario as he claims to have learned it from the gunmen was \"three guns, four shots; three hits, one miss.\" He also added at one point that two of the shots were fired almost simultaneously. He said that in the moment of panic which always fo llows an incident of this kind, they were able to get away f rom Dealey Plaza and go back to the safehouse. He made the spe cific point that the worst thing that you can do at a moment li ke that is to try to escape. And so they stayed in their safehouse fo r some ten days until things quieted down sufficiently, and th en they were flown by a private plane from Dallas to Montreal. He said that the people who met them in Montreal we re established contacts who were used to moving people in and out of the country. And that from Montreal they returne d to Marseilles. Now having told me all of this, I presented to him the obvious problem which was his personal lack of credibility. And I asked"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 75 him, \"Was there anybody in the world who could subs tantiate this story?\" And it was at that point, after thinking ab out it for a minute, that he advised me to go and look for a man named \"Michel\". [Narrator’s voice:] Michel Nicoli could have been anywhere in the world . A former narcotics trafficker turned government informant, h e had become a United States federally protected witness and had officially \"disappeared\". Steve Rivele: I searched for him in Europe, North America, Centra l America, South America. I traveled many thousands of miles, spoke to hundreds and hundreds of people. I was given a lot of false leads. I took out coded ads in newspapers all over the world addressed to him using language that he would under stand. And finally in June of 1986, I almost by accident found the one person in the US Government who knew where he was. He was a very high official of the Drug Enforcement Administratio n. I was able to persuade this man to put me in touch with him, with out telling him why I wanted to talk to Michel. And he agreed to do so. My DEA contact at one point said to me that in the thirty years that he had been in the business, Michel was the best witness h e’d ever had. He had never given the government false or misleadi ng information. And if he said something was true, as my friend said, \"You could go to the bank on it.\" Another DEA offic ial whom I spoke to in Marseilles who has known Michel as a wi tness said he’s always been, in his words, \"a dynamite witness \". [The scene changed to Michel Nicoli whose face was electronically blocked from view. The actual conver sation was in French. Interpreters translated to English.] Interviewer: Have you had any contact whatever with Christian Da vid recently? Nicoli: No, I haven’t. Interviewer: For how long?"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":" 76 Nicoli: Not since we were in Brazil together. I caught sigh t of him in prison. Only in passing, that’s all. We haven’t bee n in touch. Interviewer: So that’s how long it’s been since you have had any contact with him. Nicoli: In 1972 we came back from Brazil together. I met hi m in prison. Or rather I caught a glimpse of him in criminal cou rt. That’s all. I just caught sight of him. That’s all. Since then, I haven’t seen him. [Scene switches back to Steve Rivele interjecting a comment.] In the course of three subsequent conversations, am ong other things, Michel confirmed that Lucien Sarti was one of the three killers. And I went through with him the details th at David had given me. He confirmed all of the details with the exception of two, in which case he said he did not know those sp ecifics. But he did say that he had learned the details from the same source at the same time as David had. [Scene switches back to Michel Nicoli.] When we met in a bar in Argentina in 1966 I think. Christian David was present. There were four or five, five or six of us. I can’t remember exactly. NOTE: Nicoli may have been referring to a bar in Bu enos Aires, Argentina known as the Maison des Anciens Combattants Français. Journa lists Evert Clark and Nicholas Horrock wrote in their 1973 book, Contrabandista , that the Maison was frequented by Auguste Ricord during his post-war years in Argenti na, and that Christian David was \"one of his principal associates.\" Clark and Horroc k added that the Maison was a \"veritable haven for international gangsters.\" 3 Narrator’s voice: The final pieces of the puzzle were falling into pl ace. From the lips of Michel Nicoli, Steve now had the names of t he other two assassins. He now sought to confirm their participa tion from his first informant, still awaiting trial in his prison cell in Paris. Steve Rivele:"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 77 At that point I then went back to David. I gave him all three names, and in effect, he confirmed them. When I sho wed David an aerial photograph of Dealey Plaza, the first thi ng he said was, \"Show me where the railroad bridge is.\" I pointed o ut the bridge over Elm Street, and he said \"That was where Sarti wanted to be, but on the morning of the assassination, the bridge was guarded, and he was forced ... to move onto the little hill wi th the wooden fence.\" He took up a position from behind the woode n fence from which he fired one shot. And David specified that h e used an explosive bullet. He said that Sarti was the only o ne who used that kind of ammunition, a remark which he refused to explain, and which I didn’t understand at the time, until I put the question to Michel. When I asked Michel if it were true that Sarti had used an exploding bullet, Michel sighed and said \"Yes, t hat was what I had heard\". [Scene switches back to Michel Nicoli.] Nicoli: Oh yes, it’s Lucien Sarti. Me too. I sometimes carr ied them with me, but I didn’t used them. Interviewer: What was the advantage of having bullets like that? Nicoli: It makes a larger hole in the body. When the bullet flattens out, there aren’t any traces. No marks. Nothing. [Scene switches back to Steve Rivele.] On the question of payment, Michel agreed with Davi d that the assassins had been paid in heroin. And he went a bi t farther. In my first conversation with him, he indicated that a lthough he did not know it at the time, it was he who converted th e heroin payment into cash for the assassins. He indicated a t least initially, that the three men had appeared at his a partment in Buenos Aires in the months following the assassinat ion with, as he put it, \"a substantial quantity of heroin.\" He w as surprised because to his knowledge, it was the first time tha t any of the three of them had dealt in heroin. But given his re putation for not asking embarrassing questions, he simply agreed to convert the heroin into cash for them. [Scene switches back to Michel Nicoli and interview er.]"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 78 Interviewer: Did they ever give you any indication about who was behind this contract? Nicoli: No, they didn’t talk to me about that. It was Chris tian David who told me that it was someone in the Mafia, but I don ’t know who it was. Interviewer: But it was known more or less generally [accepted] in this circle of Frenchmen in South America that it was the Mafia that was behind it. Nicoli: Yes. [Scene switches back to Steve Rivele.] Steve Rivele: My own conviction at this point is that the contrac t probably originated with Carlos Marcello of New Orleans who placed it in Marseilles through his colleague Santo Trafficante, Jr. who had the closest relations with Antoine Guerini. Beyond that, it seems reasonable that Giancana of Chicago was involved if we accept David and Michel’s idea that the assassins were met at the border by representatives of the Chicago Mafia. And the fact that Sarti’s customers were primarily in New York, and t he fact that the assassins evidently moved out of the United Sta tes through the Montreal corridor, which was very closely linke d to the New York Mafia, also suggests that Gambino may have bee n involved. [Scene switches back to Michel Nicoli and interview er.] Interviewer: In your view, why would they go so far to find assa ssins for such a job? Nicoli: In my opinion, to obliterate any traces; to fool th e government. It’s"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 79 more difficult to find foreign killers. It’s more d ifficult, in my view. [Scene switched back to Steve Rivele.] Steve Rivele: The Mafia had to hire white men for the job since i t was to take place in the American South, which meant that they could not go to the other two centers where one found assassins at that time, namely Beirut and Hong Kong. Secondly, they needed highly experienced, skilled assassins. Thirdly, they neede d assassins who if they were caught could not directly be tied to the American Mafia, also who were not known to the American poli ce. And fourthly, once again, if they were caught, assassin s who could be counted on not to talk. [Scene switched back to Michel Nicoli and interview er.] Nicoli: When someone has a contract to kill someone, he is not rubbing out the name; he is rubbing out the person. You jus t have to kill him, that’s all. And according to who it is, you ge t paid more; according to who it is, and that’s all. Interviewer: But after all, it was the president of the United S tates they were talking about. Nicoli: If they did it, it’s because they didn’t give a dam n. There are people like David who refused to do it. There were others who didn’t refuse. Interviewer: But Sarti, would he have been capable of that? Nicoli: Oh yes. As a killer, he’s capable of anything. It’s not a question of sentiment. No sentiment with him. Portions are deleted. Steve Rivele explained how he went back to the DEA official who had put him in contact with Michel Nicoli. Rive le’s DEA contact subsequently referred the case to the FBI who essentially did no thing. In addition, Christian David refused to testify until he was freed from French p rison, but he wrote a letter of what"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 80 he knows about the Kennedy assassination and gave i t to his lawyer in a sealed envelope which was placed in a safe deposit box. Narrator: Christian David is still in Paris [prison] on the o ld murder charge, the shooting of a French policeman [Lieutenant Maur ice Galibert 4 ] in 1966. He vehemently protests his innocence. Hi s defense lawyer [narrator gave the lawyer’s French n ame, but it could not be discerned] has great faith in the cred ibility of his client and his extensive knowledge of the criminal underworld. Lawyer [has heavy French accent]: David is not anybody. He’s a serious man, and Ameri can authorities know that David is a serious man. David has been a long time in jail during his life but, anyway, he h as [done] a lot of things during his life. Then when David says someth ing, it’s serious.

Lawyer: He says, ‘Yes, I know certain things.’ ‘Could you tell me those things?’ I asked him. He told me, ‘No, I’ll talk when I’ll be free.’ But he told me, ‘I can, if you want, write to you w hat I know.’ I said, ‘All right.’ And then, he wrote to me a letter—a closed letter [ in a sealed envelope]. And on this letter it’s written [on the outside of the sealed envelope]: [The lawyer reads, in French, David’s note on the s ealed envelope. He then translates to English.] ‘This letter must be kept in [a safe] deposit by my lawyer until I am free.

I think there is in this envelope details important to find murderers; because I think there were murderers, no t only one murderer. That’s what ... is in this envelope. That’s what I think about that. [Final comments by Steve Rivele:] I’ve become convinced that Oswald had nothing to do with the assassination, and that he was very carefully chose n and very carefully set up to take the blame. Based upon what I’ve learned, it seems to me that all the principals involved in the plot to kill the President had ties of one kind or another with US i ntelligence agencies. There was Trafficante and Giancana who ha d been conspiring with the CIA to assassinate Fidel Castro ; Antoine Guerini who had had a relationship with both the OS S and the CIA dating from 1943; and there was Oswald whom I’m satisfied had been used as a low-level intelligence operative . So even though I don’t think that the CIA, for example, had anything directly to do with the assassination; on the day a fter the assassination, they found themselves in a horribly compromised position, a position in which they could very easil y have been blackmailed by the plotters into covering up whatev er they knew about the assassination. ( The Men Who Killed Kennedy , N. Turner) Criticisms of Steve Rivele’s Conclusions At this point, I must interject a note of sanity. I chose not to omit Steve Rivele’s conclusions about the Mafia because I felt it was f air to present his entire theory. Having stated that, I wish to publicly criticize hi s conclusions and his overall presentation of Christian David’s story. Furthermor e, I wish to state that I believe Christian David’s story is generally true; however, Rivele appears to be misleading the audience about certain key facts. First of all, Rivele omitted the important fact that Christian David and Lucien Sarti eventually became Auguste Ricord’s top lieutenants, along with Jean-Paul Angeletti and Francisco \"Franc ois\" Chiappe. In addition, Michel Nicoli worked for Christian David in Ricord’s heroi n cartel in South America. 5 Secondly, Rivele omitted the fact that Christian Da vid, Lucien Sarti, and Michel Nicoli are discussed at great length in two books: Contrabandista (1973), by Evert Clark and Nicholas Horrock; and The Great Heroin Coup (1976) by Henrik Krüger. Rivele gave the impression that he alone discovered Christian David; however, that is simply not true. This explains why Rivele has never published a book, in English, on the information he disclosed in The Men Who Killed Kennedy . Rivele has, however, authored a French book, The Murderers of John F. Kennedy , published in France in 1988. 6 To my knowledge that book was never translated to English or published in America. This is quite odd. Why wasn’t his book wri tten in English so Americans"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 82 could read it? After all, his expertise was the ass assination of an American president, not a French one. As far as I can determine, the on ly American work Rivele has authored is the screenplay for Oliver Stone’s movie , Nixon . I shall have a view things to say about Stone later. Thirdly, Rivele made a few comments that appear to be disinformation intended to disassociate linkage between the assassins and hero in trafficking which would point to Auguste Ricord. Rivele stated that the three ass assins \"appeared at [Michel Nicoli’s] apartment in Buenos Aires in the months following t he assassination with, as he put it, ‘a substantial quantity of heroin.’ He [Nicoli] was surprised because to his knowledge, it was the first time that any of the three of them had dealt in heroin.\" Nicoli reportedly converted the heroin to cash for the ass assins, although he claimed he did not know they had killed Kennedy at the time. He le arned that about three years later. Rivele’s claim that the French-Corsican hit men had never dealt in heroin is difficult to believe. How can that be? If they were gangsters from Marseilles, France, surely they must have dealt with heroin. Marseilles was a major production center of heroin at that time, and Turkey was its primary opium sour ce. When the Mediterranean supply became unavailable, the French-Corsican Mafi a in Marseilles migrated to Southeast Asia as their primary source. Rivele hims elf stated that Christian David had been a \"member of the old French Connection heroin network.\" If David dealt with heroin and he worked with the underworld figures wh o killed Kennedy, it seems difficult to believe that his \"colleagues\" would no t have dealt with heroin as well. You will recall that according to Rivele, Christian Dav id was offered the contract to kill Kennedy by Antoine Guerini, one of the Guerini brot hers—a French-Corsican crime family from Marseilles that was quite familiar with heroin trafficking. Rivele’s \"never dealt in heroin\" remark becomes som ewhat comical when you realize that Michel Nicoli was living in an apartment in Bu enos Aires, Argentina when the assassins looked him up in early 1964. Authors Ever t Clark and Nicholas Horrock indicated in their 1973 book, Contrabandista , that Auguste Ricord—the heroin kingpin—was living in Buenos Aires at that time. Fo r people who had never dealt in heroin before, these guys (the assassins) sure knew a lot a folks in that line of work. It is quite clear that Steve Rivele was protecting Aug uste Ricord. Fourthly, one has to question Rivele’s credibility when he made the following statement: \"I don’t think that the CIA, for example , had anything directly to do with the assassination.\" Like so many others, Rivele tri ed to blame the conspiracy solely on the Mafia. The CIA’s only crime, according to Rivel e, was that they had done business with the Mafia in the past. Therefore, the y had reason to cover-up the truth about the Kennedy assassination. Given Rivele’s obv ious knowledge of the Kennedy assassination, this conclusion is absurd. Rivele ad mitted that Antoine Guerini had a relationship with the OSS dating back to 1943, but he did not mention Louis Bloomfield—a well-known OSS/CIA operative and major supporter of Israel—who also had a law office, Phillips in Vineberg, in Par is. 7 Rivele should have mentioned Bloomfield since David stated that the assassins were flown, after the assassination, from Dallas to Mont real and from Montreal to Marseilles. Louis Bloomfield lived in Montreal. So did his brother Bernard Bloomfield and Sam Bronfman. All three men were hig hly influential Zionists. Given"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":" 83 that Bloomfield had been an OSS and CIA operative a nd was an ardent supporter of Israel, this points to Mossad as well. These facts point more to Israel than the Mafia, not to mention the CIA. And Christian David had a v ast background with French intelligence, specifically SDECE, which surely inte racts with the CIA. Obviously there was a strong presence of American and French- Corsican underworld figures in Kennedy’s murder. But in plain English, Rivele’s di smissal of CIA involvement was nonsense. Even Rivele’s statements about the Mafia were off-t rack. He stated that Santo Trafficante was likely involved, but he failed to m ention that Trafficante was a top lieutenant for Jewish Mafia chief Meyer Lansky. Lan sky’s involvement in heroin trafficking and opium smuggling from the Golden Tri angle was documented in Alfred McCoy’s 1972 book, The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia . 8 In addition, the 1979 House Select Committee on Assassinations linked Mey er Lansky to Jack Ruby. 9 Lastly, it is highly possible that Clay Shaw asked Antoine Guerini to recruit French- Corsican assassins to kill President Kennedy. Shaw also worked for the OSS in the 1940s and held the rank of Colonel. 10 As previously stated in Chapter 3, there is strong circumstantial evidence that Shaw also serve d as a Colonel in the French espionage organization, Service de Documentation Ex terieure et de Contre Espionage (SDECE), under the aliases of a Colonel René Bertra nd and Colonel Beaumont. 11 The French Colonel was close friends with Jo Attia who worked with the Guerini brothers—which included Antoine Guerini, the man wh o Christian David claimed offered him the contract to kill President Kennedy in May or June of 1963 in Guerini’s club in Marseilles. According to Danish j ournalist Henrik Krüger, it was Attia who first introduced Christian David to the w orld of espionage. 12 I suspect this information is in Christian David’s letter which is in a sealed envelope in a safe deposit box. The Three Assassins I have mentioned several times the 1973 book, Contrabandista , written by Evert Clark and Nicholas Horrock. Contrabandista corroborates much of Christian David’s story, and it reveals the identities of two other h it men who worked with Lucien Sarti that I believe were his accomplices—assassins—in mu rdering President Kennedy. Their names were Jean-Paul Angeletti and Francisco \"Francois\" Chiappe. Several facts point to them as the assassins. First of all, the book Contrabandista fits David’s description of the assassins like a glove. Although the book discusses David a great de al, it is really about Auguste Joseph Ricord—the French-Corsican underworld figure , Nazi collaborator, and heroin kingpin of Latin America. The book named five indiv iduals as Ricord’s main assistants. Of those five, three appeared in The Men Who Killed Kennedy . They were Christian David, Michel Nicoli, and Lucien Sarti (p osthumously). It was stated in the documentary that two unnamed French-Corsican hit me n assisted Sarti in the assassination. In Contrabandista , Clark and Horrock named two additional men—of the five top people in Ricord’s cartel—who fit the descriptions of the two unnamed assassins. They were Jean-Paul Angeletti and Franci sco \"Francois\" Chiappe. Those"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 84 two men, plus Sarti and David, became Auguste Ricor d’s top four lieutenants in the late 1960s. Michel Nicoli—another man who appeared in The Men Who Killed Kennedy —was one of two deputies who reported to Christian David. The other was William Perrin. 13 ( Footnote 8 ) Secondly, Angeletti and Chiappe were wanted for mur der, as were David and Sarti (according to Clark and Horrock). Contrabandista states that David, Sarti, Angeletti, and Chiappe were extremely violent men who carried guns constantly and did not hesitate to use them. 14 The authors specifically stated that Sarti and Chi appe were what Latins call \"pistoleros.\" 15 Thirdly, Henrik Krüger wrote in his 1976 book— The Great Heroin Coup —that François Chiappe’s nickname was \"Big Lips.\" 16 This is significant because several eye witnesses to the Kennedy assassination said the y saw a \"negro\" man with a rifle looking out of a window on the sixth floor of the T exas School Book Depository minutes before the assassination. 17 With a bit of dark make-up, a white man with big lips could easily pass for being black, especially from a distance. In addition, Christian David told Steve Rivele that \"on jobs lik e this [political assassinations], they were always in disguise.\" (Reference transcript fro m The Men Who Killed Kennedy .) Fourth point: Krüger wrote that Chiappe \"had worked for the Guerini mob\" 18 which means that Antoine Guerini very well might have off ered him the contract to kill Kennedy, just as he had offered it to Christian Dav id. Fifth point: Angeletti, Chiappe, and Sarti were ver y big players in the heroin business. They were also French-Corsicans with ties to The Gu erini Family of Marseilles. Alfred McCoy—primary author of The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia —linked the Guerini Family to heroin smuggling from Southea st Asia during the Vietnam War. In addition, Kennedy’s assassination has been linke d to escalation of the Vietnam War (reference Jim Garrison and other researchers). Angeletti, Chiappe, and Sarti all worked as lieutenants for Auguste Ricord who was a direct beneficiary of drugs produced in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. He smuggled narcotics made from opium grown in the Golden Triangle back into t he United States. Ricord was the number one smuggler of heroin into the United State s during the late 1960s and early 70s. Put it all together and this makes Angeletti, Chiappe, and Sarti prime suspects in the assassination of President Kennedy. Christian David Christian David was a French Corsican who eventuall y became Auguste Ricord’s bodyguard and headed one of Ricord’s five divisions . He was also a bold international criminal, highly respected and feared within the un derworld, who had lived with violence since his childhood in occupied France. Hi s criminal career swung like a pendulum, mostly doing mercenary work for both the French underground but often performing assignments for that country’s secret po litical police as well. 19 David was born in 1929 in the city of Bordeaux in t he south of France. 20 He was about 33 or 34 years old when President Kennedy was killed on November 22,"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 85 1963. 21 He was only 58 when he appeared in The Men Who Killed Kennedy 1988, although he looked like an old man in the documenta ry because he had endured severe torture in a Brazilian prison in 1972. 22 Of medium height and slender physique, a swarthy co mplexion common among Corsicans, a younger healthier Christian David walk ed with the firm, assured stride of a warrior, preferred elegantly tailored Continental -style clothes, and always carried a weapon. He was carrying a pistol with a silencer an d a grenade when the Brazilian police arrested him in 1972. Danish journalist Henrik Krüger wrote the following description of Christian David in his book, The Great Heroin Coup : [Christian David has] been a pimp, robber, hired as sassin for French intelligence, hatchet man in Algiers torture chambers, arms trader, spy, narcotics trafficker and true to form, lover of beautiful women. He’s one of the few alive who know s the truth about the Ben Barka affair that shook France in 196 5; he knows details of the brutal power struggle within French intelligence agency SDECE; of SDECE collaboration with the Corsi can Mafia; and of the secret CIA operations in Latin America. Ample grounds for anyone’s paranoia. But David is cunning and tough, and that is why he’s still alive. 23 David liked to gamble; he loved the casinos in Rio, Buenos Aires, Asunción, and Montevideo. Although he was Corsican—known for thei r code of silence—David had a reputation as a talker. He once boasted that in 1 969 Ricord’s organization had moved 1,000 kilograms of heroin into the United Sta tes in one big load. The heroin had been concealed in bags of money, placed in an a rmored truck, driven from Mexico to Houston, Texas, where it was stored in a warehouse then later distributed to buyers in Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles, and N ew York. 24 Often using aliases, Jean-Pierre, Eduardo, and Beau Serge, 25 David was often seen with Auguste Ricord at the Maison des Anciens Comba ttants Français, a well-known haven for international gangsters in Buenos Aires, Argentina. David was an international criminal at that time. In the 1960s h e was wanted by the French authorities for murdering Paris Policeman Lieutenan t Maurice Galibert 26 —who, when he was shot, was investigating the kidnapping and m urder of Moroccan political exile, Mehdi Ben Barka. 27 This indicates that Christian David was likely inv olved in Ben Barka’s death. Mehdi Ben Barka was a Moroccan revolutionary politi cian who lived in exile in Paris in the early Sixties. It was widely viewed that Ben Barka would soon be president for the Republic of Morocco. When Morocco and Algeria h ad a brief war in 1963, Ben Barka sided with Algeria and went into exile. He wa s subsequently accused of high treason for an alleged plot against King Hassan II and was sentenced in absentia to death. He moved to Paris and became leader-in-exile of the opposition to Hassan. On October 29, 1965, Ben Barka disappeared. He was nev er found, and investigators concluded that gangsters were paid to kidnap and mu rder him. It was suggested"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 86 several times that the plot was headed by General M uhammad Oufkir, Hassan's minister of the interior. The Ben Barka affair crea ted a political crisis for the government of French President Charles de Gaulle an d led to ruptured diplomatic relations between France and Morocco for almost fou r years. 28 In the spring, summer, and fall of 1972, the govern ments of South and Central American were working with the Nixon administration to stop heroin from being smuggled into the United States. In October 1972 th e Brazilian federal police arrested David and Nicoli along with several other Brazilian underworld figures. Most of them were using false identity papers. David, Nicoli, an d another Frenchmen were transported by air to federal police headquarters i n Brazilia, the nation’s capital, where Brazilian police interrogated them in a manne r that has made Brazil notorious throughout the world. 29 David was stripped of his clothing and hung upside down in the interrogation cell. He claimed he was tortured with electric shocks applie d to his testicles and the head of his penis. Evidently he did not talk; however, the torture became so severe that he attempted suicide by swallowing a light bulb rather than undergo more. He later cut his wrists with glass fragments. After that he walk ed bowlegged from the pain. 30 This was the Christian David that the world saw in Nigel Turner’s documentary, The Men Who Killed Kennedy —a man of 58 using a walker who appeared to be close r to 80. Ultimately David was extradited to the United State s, along with Auguste Ricord, for heroin smuggling. This was part of the Nixon admini stration’s war on drugs. David was taken to a Brooklyn courthouse where his bail w as set at $2.5 million. Within two weeks federal judge Jacob Mishler sentenced David t o twenty years in prison for smuggling half a ton of heroin into the United Stat es. In addition, the trial revealed David’s ties to the French intelligence service kno wn as Service d’Action Civique (SAC). His tri-colored SAC ID was placed on display as he explained: \"I was taken from prison in 1961 to work for an organization cal led SAC. It was arranged by someone with connections in the highest political c ircles.\" He also commented on his incarceration in Brazil: \"I was tortured by the Bra zilians for thirty days and fed nothing for twenty-six days. They stole my money. T oday I can’t afford a lawyer, I haven’t a cent.\" 31 Michel Nicoli Michel Nicoli was the man who corroborated Christia n David’s claim, in The Men Who Killed Kennedy , that Lucien Sarti and two other \"unnamed\" Corsica n assassins shot and killed President Kennedy; and that Sarti, while dressed as a police officer standing behind the picket fence on the grassy knol l, shot Kennedy in the head using an exploding bullet. Michel Nicoli was the same age as Christian David; born in about 1929. He was about 33 or 34 years old when President Kennedy was kille d on November 22, 1963. 32 He was Christian David’s deputy in Auguste Ricord’s dr ug cartel. David, as stated before, was Ricord’s personal bodyguard and became one of R icord’s top four lieutenants as well."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 87 Nicoli was quite different from Ricord’s violent li eutenants, Christian David, Lucien Sarti, François Chiappe, and Jean-Paul Angeletti, i n that he was far less lethal; although he carried a gun from time to time for pro tection. In his line of work, this was not unwise; however, Nicoli was quite sophistic ated and a smooth convincing talker, which made him an excellent witness as Stev e Rivele pointed out in The Men Who Killed Kennedy . Although he was obviously a criminal, he had the reputation among narcotics agents for giving truthful and cons istent information when he talked. Corsican criminals in particular are taken seriousl y because they have an ancient tradition of not talking when captured, even when t ortured. Consequently, when one of them talks, people listen. But capturing Nicoli in a compromising situation where it was beneficial for him to talk was no small task. As a drug trafficker, Nicoli exemplified the qualit ies that confounded and frustrated narcotics agents to no end. He was a master at chan ging identities. He used several aliases: Abraham Goldman, Miguel dos Santos, and Ra niers, to name a few. 33 Frank DeSantis, an American Customs agent said of N icoli in the early 1970s: \"It’s fantastic. These people are not jerks. We’ve ripped off a thousand of their couriers and this group doesn’t founder. It perseveres. They change identities like we change shirts.

Like David, Nicoli was also tortured; stripped, hung upside down and tortured w ith electric shocks. Like Christian David he apparently did not talk, which intensified and prolonged the torture. He became depressed, began banging his head into the c ell walls. Later he was examined by American authorities who observed bumps and brui ses on his head, and found indications of permanent nerve damage. 36 Obviously he recovered by 1988 when he appeared in The Men Who Killed Kennedy . At least he appeared to be in much better physical condition than his old friend Christian David, who was the same age, 58 at the ti me. Auguste Joseph Ricord, the Heroin Kingpin Auguste Joseph Ricord was a French Corsican born in Marseilles, France on April 26, 1911. 37 He was 52 years old when President Kennedy was kil led on November 22, 1963. He was 62 when he was convicted of drug traff icking in the United States in 1973.

By the early 1970s his hair wa s gray-white, although not much was left of it. 38 Marseilles is the largest commercial seaport in Fra nce and the second largest city. Founded more than 2,500 years ago, it is located on the Mediterranean’s Gulf of Lion within a semicircle of limestone hills. Although a colorful city, Marseilles has a history of vigorous independence and criminal activ ity. 39 Most law-enforcement people familiar with Auguste Ricord believe it was the sinister influences within the ancient city of Marseilles that led Ricord not only to a life of crime, but developed him into a tough con artist, a master of deception. 40 A cunning, hardened man, Ricord acquired a skill for slipping out of trouble as eas ily as he slipped into it. 41 Two weeks before his sixteenth birthday, Ricord was convicted of theft and extortion. Within a few months the Marseilles authorities had added another entry to his record: \"violence, unauthorized possession of a firearm.\" 42 At that point Ricord left Marseilles and became a fugitive living on the run. While in Paris, on November 15, 1927, another entry was added to his criminal recor d: \"possession and sale of stolen property.\" 43 On January 3, 1939 the police in Paris arrested hi m for unauthorized possession of a side arm. 44 After that the Paris police reported that he \"live d from the proceeds earned from prostitution but was never arr ested for it.\" 45 When the Nazis marched through Paris in June of 194 0 they formed alliances with various elements within the criminal underworld. Au guste Joseph Ricord was one of those people. 46 It is not known precisely what role he played with the Nazis, but in July 1950, he was convicted of collaborating with t he Third Reich and sentenced to death in absentia by the Permanent Military Court o f Paris. A year later the civilian court of Eure-et-Loir reduced his sentence to twent y years hard labor and ten years banishment from France; the latter sentence was for a theft conviction several years earlier. 47 After World War II Ricord knew he would soon be dec lared an enemy of France because of his Gestapo connections. Consequently, h e fled the country, first going to Germany and Austria, then settling in Milan, Italy for a time. In 1948 he moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina, thereby escaping the Frenc h death sentence in 1950. 48 Somewhere along the way Ricord left behind a wife, probably in Paris. In Buenos Aires he remarried a shapely German-born nightclub stripper named Ingebord Gabski. Together they had a daughter, Josephine Brigette (o r Josefina Brigita in Spanish), before separating in 1960. 49 While living in Paris, Ricord reportedly owned a re staurant, called the Navarin, with his half-sister, Maria Traversa Bonsigour. They sol d it for $40,000 before fleeing the country. 50 Ricord later boasted from his jail cell in the Tacu mbu prison—the largest prison in Asuncion, Paraguay—that he had left France for Ital y and South America \"with more than $100,000 in my pockets.\" 51 After moving to Argentina Ricord operated several r estaurants and night clubs, with help from Maria. First he bought two night clubs, L e Fetiche and Lido. At various"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 89 times he owned and operated six restaurants: El Nid o, Chez Danielle, L’Etoile, the Bar el Sol (later renamed L’Auberge Provençale), th e M. André, and the Pompitor. 52 Ricord’s business soon turned into a vast underworl d enterprise. He used several aliases: M. André, Cori, Dédé, 53 Lucien Darguelles. 54 He also used variations of his real name: Auguste José Gallese (his parents’ name) , and variations on existing aliases: Lucien Dorguelle, Lucio Maria Darguelles, or Lucien Gegelles. 55 Maintaining multiple identities was a con-trick he learned as a young man in Paris. 56 Although ostensibly a restaurateur and nightclub ow ner, the bulk of his income came from his interest in prostitution. According to som e estimates, revenues from Ricord’s enterprise ran as high as $3 million a year. His bu siness was based in Buenos Aires but spread into Brazil, Uruaguay, and Caracas, Vene zuela. 57 Much of his fast-growing power was attributed to his expertise at harboring international criminals—many of them were ex-Nazis or Nazi collaborators from Franc e when Germany occupied that country—by channeling them into his prostitution sy ndicate. 58 Many \"trusted men\" within the underworld were sent to Ricord from Mars eilles, Algiers, Milan, Casablanca, Rome, and Barcelona. These fugitives wo uld meet Ricord, or his designee, at the Bar el Sol at 380 Marconi Street i n the suburb of Olivos. 59 In addition, Ricord used to frequent the Maison des Anciens Comb attants Français, a well-known haven for international gangsters. 60 In 1957 Ricord was arrested by the Argentine police for corruption and criminal association after Interpol—the international police information-swapping organization—learned of his prostitution network. T he French quickly learned of his arrest and requested that Argentina hand him over f or previous convictions which included, primarily, collaborating with the Nazis. Interpol, however, did not recognize that as a crime. In addition, Argentina refused to extradite Ricord. Like Uruguay, Argentina was populated by many European immigrants who fled their homelands to escape political oppression. As a result, the Argen tine government turned the French down and released Ricord. He immediately fled to Mo ntevideo, Uruguay and used the alias, Lucien Darguelles. In Uruguay, France sought his extradition again, but Uruguay followed Argentina’s lead and refuse to han d him over to the French authorities. Ricord was soon released and quickly w ent underground but surfaced in Caracas, Venezuela in 1958 as the owner of Le Domin o, a nightclub that was very active in prostitution. 61 In 1967 François Chiappe accompanied Auguste Ricord to his lawyer’s office (at 1800 Calle La Valle, Buenos Aires, Argentina) when Ricord gave Jacob Grodnitzky, alias Jack Grosby, $20,000 to pay the bail for Rico rd’s nephew, Louis Bonsignour, alias Felipe Spadaro. Louis was the son of Ricord’s half-sister, Maria Traversa Bonsignour. Louis had been arrested in the United S tates and indicted, in May 1967, for conspiring to smuggle heroin into the country. 62 Grodnitzky had been solicited by Louis’s girlfriend to fly to Argentina and get $20, 000 for his bail. Also present at Ricord’s lawyer’s office were Christian David, Mich el Nicoli, among others. 63 The stated meeting is significant because it would eventually be used by US narcotics agents to reveal Ricord’s South American involvemen t in heroin trafficking. Prior to 1967, US narcotics agents thought that most of the heroin smuggled into the US came solely from a French smuggling ring. Ricord’s nephe w, Louis Bonsignour, was"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 90 French and, consequently, the US narcotics agents h ad incorrectly assumed that France was the source of the smuggling ring. The fa ct that Louis’s bail money came from his uncle in Argentina would eventually be use d to build a case against Ricord as the kingpin of a Latin-based heroin cartel. Around 1968 Ricord returned to Argentina. Almost im mediately he helped two old acquaintances, Lucien Sarti and Francisco \"François \" Chiappe, both fugitive Corsican murderers on the run. Sarti was wanted for murderin g a Belgian policeman and Chiappe had been sentenced to death for another mur der. Shortly after arriving in Argentina, and being given safe haven by Ricord, th e two fugitives held up a money order exchange. The police arrested them and Ricord . A search of Ricord’s restaurant near the Rio de la Plata Football Stadium in Buenos Aires turned up a cache of arms, including machine guns. Ricord was declared persona non grata and kicked out of Argentina. Ironically, none of them went to jail fo r the crime. 64 It was the machine guns and other arms found after their arrest that g ot Ricord ousted from Argentina, not the armed robbery by Sarti and Chiappe. 65 Ricord then moved to Asunción, Paraguay. 66 It is not known for certain exactly when Ricord beg an trafficking narcotics, but a French intelligence report indicated that it began between 1957 and 1968, flourished after his arrival in Paraguay. 67 Paraguay was the perfect location to manage a larg e- scale heroin cartel. It was basically uninhabited—t wo and a half million people crowded around Asunción. The Chaco Boreal ( Footnote 9 ) is two-thirds of the land area but only 100,000 people live out there, and it is f ull of landing fields unmonitored by governmental authorities. 68 By 1969—at the age of 59—Ricord’s health began to w eaken. He suffered from diabetes and was frequently struck by terrible wear iness or bursts of listlessness and dissatisfaction. He felt under pressure because he was a fugitive in many countries; Argentina had thrown him out twice; Uruguay once; h is homeland France wanted him back but only to put him in jail. 69 His four younger lieutenants—Christian David, Lucien Sarti, Francois Chiappe, and Jean-Paul Angel etti—had strong ambitions and were greedy to establish themselves. All four had c ome to him from Europe fleeing police warrants. Although he gave them political sa fety, false documents, and responsibilities within his criminal enterprise, Ri cord sometimes feared that his leadership was being eroded by these aggressive you nger men. 70 One of the few things that gave him pleasure was th e construction of Le Paris-Niza, an inn and restaurant in Asunción, Paraguay. It end ed up costing over $100,000, but it was more than a restaurant. It was his Franco-Medit erranean island in Latin America. He took particular pride in the restaurant. He hire d an expatriate French couple to manage it and insisted that the waiters be taught t he Gallic manner of serving. 71 When President Nixon took office in January 1969, h e stepped up the war on drugs and focused on heroin smuggling. Under Nixon’s dire ction the Ricord Case became a joint effort between the US Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (USBNDD) and the Bureau of Customs. 72 In the late Sixties narcotics agents realized that heroin shipments were being sent to the United states by way of South America, although rumors of the Latin route had"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 91 been around since 1964 and 65. 73 Customs agent Albert W. Seeley—the man who built the case against Ricord—said that in 1962, th e amount of heroin being smuggled into the United States was \"no big deal.\" 74 Special Agent Bill Knierem, with the Bureau of Customs, stated the following in a 1973 i nterview: From ’62 to ’67 it was all bodies and suitcases. [T he term \"bodies\" means that individual smugglers/couriers s trapped packets of heroin to their bodies.] They get it in France, they go to the US, Canada, Mexico. We are getting beat. The y also begin to ship from Europe in freezers, in oscilloscopes. Automobiles get knocked off. They are full of it. The French must h ave been saying, ‘You Customs guys got no imagination at all .’ ’60 to ’68 was still a good period for federal law enforcement. Then the red lines (he points to the smuggling rout es marked in red on his flip chart) begin to fan out. Fort Laude rdale, Boston, Washington, et cetera. It’s no longer just New York and Montreal—they’re coming in everywhere. We are looking at Marseilles and Barcelona and New York and Montreal and they were hitting us underneath, from Latin America. We ought to be ashamed there. We were look ing the wrong way. It was basically a failure in law enforc ement.\" 75 The observations of narcotics agents Seeley and Kni erem are significant because they indicate that heroin did not become a problem until around the time of President Kennedy’s assassination in 1963, and it slowly incr eased thereafter until becoming an epidemic in 1968. That was the year that Richard Ni xon campaigned for the Presidency. The war on drugs became a major campaig n issue for him. In 1969 the \"demand\" for heroin in America had incr eased so dramatically that Ricord decided to use Contrabandistas —a network of light aircraft that flew cigarettes, whisky, wigs, and Levis from Miami into various Sou th American countries. This was the only way he could send the high-volumes needed for the US market. 76 Ricord used the Contrabandista network in a three tiered approach. Firstly, a pil ot— and usually an assistant—flew a small airplane to a n appointed place and waited for instructions. They did not know the buyer of the ca rgo and without this \"connection\" they were powerless to hijack the load even if they had wanted to double-cross the system. Secondly, a couple of men were sent to meet the pilot et al and shepherd them to the delivery point. At that point, the shepherds knew where the heroin was and they would transport it to a contact man in New York. Th is contact man was the \"third tier.\" 77 The third tier person knew where to drop off the he roin to the buyer. Even the third tier did not know much information about the buyer— not even his/her name. Only Ricord knew that. The third tier was only given a l ocation where the goods would be delivered. Often the third tier would be advised to walk along a certain street at a specified time with a suitcase full of heroin. A ca r would stop and someone would"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 92 quickly snatch it and drive away. They would then m eet the third tier in 30 minutes or so to drop off a suitcase full of cash if they felt the quality of the goods was sufficient. Ricord insisted on using a Frenchman, Pierre Gahou, as the third tier contact man with the buyer because he obviously needed someone he co uld trust. The first two tiers did not have to be as trustworthy because his system wa s essentially fool-proof at those levels. 78 On March 15, 1971 a federal grand jury in Manhatten returned a secret indictment against Ricord, charging him with conspiracy to smu ggle heroin into the United States. 79 Paraguay’s President General Alfred Stroessner sub sequently ordered Ricord’s arrest. 80 The arrest order was carried out March 26, 1971, b ut President Stroessner had second thoughts about extraditing Ri cord to the United States to face conspiracy charges for smuggling heroin. Stroessner had cultural issues with the extradition request. In Paraguay, smuggling was a w ay of life; and conspiracy laws did not exist. Consequently, Ricord sat in a jail c ell in Tacumbu Penitentiary in Asunción, Paraguay for a year and a half while Para guay and the United States engaged in a diplomatic tug of war over custody of the wily heroin kingpin. 81 Finally in September 1972 Ricord was extradited to the Unit ed States and prosecuted for conspiracy to smuggle narcotics into America. 82 On December 16, 1972 he was convicted of that crime, and on January 19, 1973, h e was sentenced to 20 years in prison and fined $25,000. 83 Lucien Sarti Lucien Sarti was the man who shot President Kennedy in the head with an exploding bullet from behind the picket fence on top of the g rassy knoll in Dealey Plaza. Sarti was identified as the stated assassin by Christian David whose assertion was corroborated by Michel Nicoli in The Men Who Killed Kennedy . Sarti was a lieutenant for Auguste Ricord. Sarti was a French Corsican born in about 1931 and was about 32 years old when President Kennedy was killed on November 22, 1963. 84 Sarti had been an \"enforcer\" for criminal elements in Europe. He had killed a po liceman in Belgium—a crime that hit men normally avoided lest they incur the wrath of all other policemen in the world. 85 In December 1967, Sarti managed a heroin smuggling network based in Montreal, Canada for Auguste Ricord. The network consisted of at least 15 couriers who smuggled heroin into New York City from Montreal. 86 As previously stated the Nixon administration inten sified its war on drugs in the spring, summer, and fall of 1972, and the governmen ts of South and Central American worked closely with the United States gove rnment to bring down Auguste Ricord and his heroin cartel. In the spring of 1972 the Mexican authorities were closing in on Lucien Sarti and his younger colleague, Jean-Paul Angeletti. The two men were arrested in La Paz, Bolivia, but were released before the police realized their true identities. Shortly thereafter,"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 93 American narcotics agents set up a trace on them. T he pair traveled northward, through Peru and across South and Central America, finally stopping at Mexico City forty-five days later. The Americans quietly alerte d the Poliçia Judicial Federal, the equivalent of Mexico’s FBI. 87 April 27, 1972 was a muggy evening in Mexico City. At about 8:40 pm, a glistening European car stopped quietly at the curb in front o f 107 Temistocles Street in an upper-class residential area of Mexico City. The au tomobile was driven by a beautiful, thirtyish woman in casual, stylish attire. She was later identified as Lucien Sarti’s wife, Liliane Rous Vaillet. Shortly after the lovel y young lady parked the car, and waited behind the wheel, Sarti walked quickly from the house moving toward the automobile on the driver’s side. 88 Just before he opened the car door, two Mexican age nts advanced from the shadows. Instinctively, Sarti drew a .38-caliber Colt Cobra ( Footnote 10 ) and ran away as fast as he could. A few seconds later he was killed in a hail of bullets when ambushed by several Mexican agents hidden close to the house. 89 That night another group of Mexican policemen storm ed Angeletti’s hideout and surprised him while he was having sex. Being caught off-guard probably saved his life. The police officers quickly restrained him be fore he could grab the pistol on the table nearby. 90 The Mexican authorities seized fourteen false passp orts, an abundance of jewels, firearms, cash, and \"several notebooks ... with notes on large and small narcotics distributors.\" The Mexican police determined that A ngeletti, Sarti, and their wives had landed in Mexico from Panama aboard a smuggler’ s small aircraft. In addition, the Mexican agents determined that the group had be en planning to smuggle 100 kilograms of cocaine into the United States. 91 Sarti’s body was never claimed and was buried in Me xico. Angeletti, his wife, Sarti’s widow, and another drug smuggler arrested with Ange letti that night were eventually extradited to France and Italy. 92 Around the same time that Sarti was killed, his for mer mistress—Héléne Ferreira, a sexy Brazilian model—was arrested in Peru and quest ioned about Sarti and his Corsican friends. She refused to cooperate at first , so the Peruvian authorities turned her over to the Brazilian police who were infamous for torturing suspects in order to extract information. Whatever they did to her is un certain, but she began to talk immediately. She told them the whereabouts of an ar my of Brazilian, Corsican, and Italian underworld figures—including Christian Davi d and Michel Nicoli. 93 In October 1972 the Brazilian federal police arrest ed David and Nicoli along with several other Brazilian underworld figures based on information supplied by Héléne Ferreira—Lucien Sarti’s former mistress. Once arres ted David and Nicoli were subjected to relentless torture by the Brazilian au thorities. 94 Jean-Paul Angeletti"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 94 I have concluded that Jean-Paul Angeletti was one o f the three hit men who fired a rifle at President Kennedy’s motorcade.

Angeletti was a French Corsican born in about 1941 and was about 22 years old when President Kennedy was killed on November 22, 1963. 95 He was fairly tall for a Corsican, a thin man with a thin face and dark, str aight hair. The heavy bags under his eyes were put there by nature, but they added to hi s reputation as a swinger, a man who lived it up at the Carnival in Rio every year a nd frequented gambling casinos in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. His crimi nal record was quite extensive. 96 Angeletti and Francois Chiappe ran Ricord’s heroin cartel while he was incarcerated in a Tacumbu Penitentiary cell in Asunción, Paragua y for over a year—after being arrested in March 1971—pending extradition to the U nited States. 97 As previously stated, Angeletti had been traveling with Lucien Sarti when, on April 27, 1972, Sarti was ambushed and killed by Mexican police after resisting arrest and brandishing a firearm. Later that evening Angeletti was arrested by Mexican authorities, caught in the act of making love. Ange letti, his wife, Sarti’s widow, and another drug smuggler arrested with Angeletti that night were eventually extradited to France and Italy. 98 François Chiappe I have concluded that Francisco \"François\" Chiappe was one of the three hit men who fired a rifle at President Kennedy’s motorcade. He likely took his position in either an upper floor in the Texas School Book Depository or the ground floor of the Dal-Tex Building. Chiappe was a lieutenant for Auguste Rico rd. Chiappe’s precise age is not known, although he was considerably younger than Auguste Ricord—presumably within the age-range of h is collegues, Lucien Sarti, Jean-Paul Angeletti, and Christian David. 99 That means he was born between 1930 and 1941, and consequently, was between 22 and 33 w hen President Kennedy was killed on November 22, 1963. Chiappe, a burly, bulky 6-foot French Corsican who weighed about 210 pounds (in 1971), was under sentence of death for two murders in Paris. 100 Chiappe and Jean- Paul Angeletti ran Ricord’s heroin cartel while the latter was incarcerated in a Tacumbu Penitentiary cell in Asunción, Paraguay for over a year—after being arrested in March 1971—pending extradition to the U nited States. 101 Chiappe and Michel Russo (another leader within Ric ord’s syndicate) were arrested by Argentine police in Buenos Aires while attemptin g to transport over 100 pounds of pure heroin. 102 As previously stated, it is worth noting that accor ding to author Henrik Krüger, François Chiappe’s nickname was \"Big Lips.\" 103 This is significant because several"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" 95 eye witnesses to the Kennedy assassination said the y saw a black man with a rifle looking out of a window on the sixth floor of the T exas School Book Depository minutes before the assassination. 104 With a bit of dark make-up, a white man with big lips could easily pass for being black, especially from a distance.

The Mafia Comes to Asia Alfred McCoy, et al, described in his 1972 book, The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia , how the American Mafia and the Corsican crime syn dicates of Marseille turned to Southeast Asia in the 1960s as their main suppli er of opium. This is critical information because it reveals how the underworld b enefited from opium production in Southeast Asia shortly after Kennedy’s death. It also reveals that the US military knew of drug trafficking activity in Vietnam but lo oked the other way. Here is an excerpt from McCoy’s book: The flourishing heroin traffic among Vietnam-based GIs was undoubtedly the most important new market for Indoc hina's drug traffickers, but it was not the only one. As we hav e already seen, increasingly insurmountable problems in the Mediter ranean Basin had forced the American Mafia and the Corsican synd icates of Marseille to look to Southeast Asia for new sources of heroin and morphine base. Faced with the alternative of findin g a new source of morphine base or going out of business, t he Corsican syndicates of Marseille turned to their associates in Southeast Asia for help. \"There are people who think that onc e the problem in Turkey is cleaned up, that's the end of the traf fic,\" explains John Warner, chief intelligence analyst for the U.S . Bureau of Narcotics. \"But the Corsicans aren't stupid. They s aw the handwriting on the wall and began to shift their mo rphine base sources to Southeast Asia.\" 105 The Corsican narcotics syndicates based in Saigon a nd Vientiane had been supplying European drug factorie s with Southeast Asian morphine base for several years, an d links with Marseille were already well established. During the First Indochina War (1946-1954) Corsican gangsters in Mar seille and Saigon cooperated closely in smuggling gold, curren cy, and narcotics between the two ports. In 1962 Corsican g angsters in Saigon reported that Paul Louis Levet, a Bangkokbas ed syndicate leader, was supplying European heroin lab oratories with morphine base from northern Thailand. 106 Furthermore, at least four Corsican charter airlines had played a k ey role in Southeast Asia's regional opium traffic from 1955 t o 1965. Although they were forced out of business when the Laotian generals decided to cut themselves in for a bigger share of the"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":" 96 profits in 1965, most of the Corsicans had remained in Southeast Asia. They had opened up businesses or taken jobs i n Vientiane and Saigon to tide themselves over until something new opened up. 107 When Gen. Edward G. Lansdale of the CIA returned to Saigon as a special assistant to Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge in 1965, he quickly learned that his old enemies, the Corsic ans, were still in town. During the fighting between the French 2èm e Bureau and the CIA back in 1955, the Corsican gangsters ha d been involved in several attempts on his life. \"So I wou ldn't have to look behind my back every time I walked down the st reet,\" Lansdale explained in a June 1971 interview, \"I dec ided to have a meeting with the Corsican leaders. I told them I wa sn't interested in doing any criminal investigations; I wasn't in V ietnam for that. And they agreed to leave me alone. We had some kind of a truce.\" General Lansdale can no longer recall much of what transpired at that meeting. He remembers that a lar ge-busted French-Vietnamese named Helene took an active role in the proceedings, that the affair was amicable enough, b ut not much else. Lansdale later learned that the Corsicans wer e still heavily involved in the narcotics traffic, but since this w as not his responsibility, he took no action. 108 Most of what Lansdale knew about the Corsicans came from his old friend Lt. Col. Lucien Conein, the CIA agent wh o had helped engineer President Diem's overthrow in 1963. As a f ormer OSS liaison officer with the French Resistance during W orld War 11, Conein had some experiences in common with many of Saigon's Corsican gangsters. During his long tours of duty i n Saigon, Conein spent much of his time in fashionable Corsic an-owned bars and restaurants and was on intimate terms with many of Saigon's most important underworld figures. When Co nein left Vietnam several years later, the Corsicans presente d him with a heavy gold medallion embossed with the Napoleonic E agle and the Corsican crest. Engraved on the back of it is P er Tu Amicu Conein (\"For your friendship, Conein\"). Conein prou dly explains that this medallion is worn by powerful Corsican sy ndicate leaders around the world and serves as an identific ation badge for secret meetings, narcotics drops, and the like. 109 Through his friendship with the Corsicans, Conein h as gained a healthy respect for them. \"The Corsicans are smarte r, tougher, and better organized that the Sicilians,\" says Cone in. \"They are absolutely ruthless and are the equal of anything w e know about the Sicilians, but they hide their internal fightin g better.\" Conein also learned that many Saigon syndicate leaders had relatives in the Marseille underworld. These family relations pl ay an important role in the international drug traffic, C onein feels,"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" 97 because much of the morphine base used in Marseille 's heroin laboratories comes from Saigon. Corsican smugglers in Saigon purchase morphine base through Corsican contacts in Vientiane and ship it on French merchant vessels to relatives and friends in Marseille, where it is processed into heroin. 110 \"From what I know of them,\" says Conein, \"it will be absolutely impos sible to cut off the dope traffic. You can cut it down, but you can never stop it, unless you can get to the growers in the hills.\" 111 This pessimism may explain why Conein and Lansdale did not pass on this information to the U.S. Bureau of Narc otics. It is particularly unfortunate that General Lansdale deci ded to arrange \"some kind of a truce\" with the Corsicans during th e very period when Marseille's heroin laboratories were probably beginning the changeover from Turkish to Southeast Asian morphine base. In a mid-1971 interview, Lieutenant Colonel Conein said that power brokers in Premier Ky's apparatus contacted the lea ders of Saigon's- Corsican underworld in 1965-1966 and agre ed to let them start making large drug shipments to Europe in exchange for a fixed percentage of the profits. By October 1 969 these shipments had become so important to Marseille's he roin laboratories that, according to Conein, there was a summit meeting of Corsican syndicate bosses from around th e world at Saigon's Continental Palace Hotel. Syndicate leader s from Marseille, Bangkok, Vientiane, and Phnom Penh flew in for the meeting, which discussed a wide range of internatio nal rackets but probably focused on reorganizing the narcotics traffic. 112 According to one well-informed U.S. diplomat in Sai gon, the U.S. Embassy has a reliable Corsican informant who claim s that similar meetings were also held in 1968 and 1970 at the Continental Palace. Most significantly, American Ma fia boss Santo Trafficante, Jr., visited Saigon in 1968 and is believed to have contacted Corsican syndicate leaders there. Vi etnamese police officials report that the current owner of t he Continental Palace is Philippe Franchini, the heir of Mathieu F ranchini, the reputed organizer of currency- and opium-smuggling rackets between Saigon and Marseille during the First Indoc hina War. Police officials also point out that one of Ky's st rongest supporters in the Air Force, Transport Division Com mander Col. Phan Phung Tien, is close to many Corsican gangster s and has been implicated in the smuggling of drugs between L aos and Vietnam. From 1965 to 1967 Gen. Lansdale's Senior Liaison Of fice worked closely with Premier Ky's administration, and the g eneral himself was identified as one of the young premier's strong er supporters among U.S. mission personnel. 113 One can only wonder whether Conein's and Lansdale's willingness to grant the Co rsicans a"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 98 \"truce\" and overlook their growing involvement in t he American heroin traffic might not have been motivated by pol itical considerations, i.e., their fear of embarrassing Pr emier Ky. Just as most of the Corsican gangsters now still ac tive in Saigon and Vientiane came to Indochina for the first time as camp followers of the French Expeditionary Corps in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the American Mafia followed the U.S. a rmy to Vietnam in 1965. Like any group of intelligent inve stors, the Mafia is always looking for new financial \"frontiers,\" an d when the Vietnam war began to heat up, many of its more entr epreneurial young members were bankrolled by the organization a nd left for Saigon. Attracted to Vietnam by lucrative construct ion and service contracts, the mafiosi concentrated on ordi nary graft and kickbacks at first, but later branched out into nar cotics smuggling as they built up their contacts in Hong Kong and In dochina. Probably the most important of these pioneers was F rank Carmen Furci, a young mafioso from Tampa, Florida. Although any ordinary businessman would try to hide this kin d of family background from his staid corporate associates, Fra nk Furci found that it impressed the corrupt sergeants, shad y profiteers, and Corsican gangsters who were his friends and ass ociates in Saigon. He told them all proudly, \"My father is the Mafia boss of Tampa, Florida.\" 114 (Actually, Frank's father, Dominick Furci, is only a middle-ranking lieutenant in the powerful Fl orida-based family. Santo Trafficante, Jr., is, of course, the Mafia boss of Tampa. 115 Furci arrived in Vietnam in 1965 with good financi al backing and soon became a key figure in the systema tic graft and corruption that began to plague U.S. military c lubs in Vietnam as hundreds of thousands of GIs poured into the war zone. 116 A lengthy U.S. Senate investigation later exposed the network of graft, bribes, and kickbacks that Furci and his fellow profiteers employed to cheat military clubs and the ir GI customers out of millions of dollars. At the bottom of the system were 500,000 bored and homesick GIs who found Vietn amese rice too sticky and the strong fish sauce repugnant . The clubs were managed by senior NCOs, usually serg eant majors, who had made the army their career and were considered dedicated, trustworthy men. While the of ficers were preoccupied with giving orders and running a war, t he sergeants were left with responsibility for all of the minor details involved in managing one of the largest restaurant and night cl ub chains in the world—ordering refrigerators, hiring bands, sel ecting liquor brands, and negotiating purchasing orders for every thing from slot machines to peanuts. Accounting systems were s hoddy, and the entire system was pathetically vulnerable to we ll-organized graft. Seven sergeants who had served together in t he Twenty-"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" 99 fourth Infantry Division at Augsburg, Germany, duri ng the early 1960s had discovered this weakness and exploited it fully, stealing up to $40,000 a month from NCO clubs. 117 In 1965 these seven sergeants started showing up in Vietnam as mess custodians and club managers at the First Infa ntry Division, the American Division, and U.S. army headquarters a t Long Binh. 118 Most important of all, the group's ringleader, Sgt William 0. Wooldridge, was appointed sergeant major of the army in July 1966. As the army's highest-ranking enlisted man, h e served directly under the army chief of staff at the Penta gon, where he was in an ideal position to manipulate personnel tr ansfers and cover up the group's activities. 119 At the top of the system were the civilian entrepre neurs—Frank Furci and his competitor, William J. Crum—who worke d as agents for a host of American companies and paid th e sergeants lavish kickbacks on huge Army purchase orders for k itchen equipment, snacks, liquor, etc. Furci was also heavily involved in the currency bla ck market. A U.S. Senate investigation of illegal currency manip ulations in Vietnam later showed that he had exchanged $99,200 through a single unauthorized money changer at the black mark et rate of 300 or 400 piasters to the dollar, considerably mor e than the official rate of 118 piasters. 120 Unfortunately for Furci, his competitor, William J. Crum, was also aware of these illegal transactions, and he decided to use this knowledge to force Furci out of business. Frank Fur ci was simply outclassed by the crippled, half-blind William Crum , an old China hand who has made a profit on almost every war in A sia since 1941. Attracted by the economic potential of the gr owing Southeast Asia conflict, Crum came out of his milli ondollar retirement in Hong Kong and moved to Saigon in 1962 . 121 While the massive U.S. military buildup in 1965 had attracted other commercial agents as well, Crum seemed partic ularly resentful of Furci, whose competing line of liquor brands, slot machines, and kitchen equipment had \"stolen\" $2.5 m illion worth of his business. 122 Crum passed on information about Furci's illegal currency transactions to the Fraud Repressi on Division of the Vietnamese customs service through a U.S. army general whom Crum was paying $1,000 a month for protection. 123 Vietnamese customs raided Furci's offices in July 1 967, found evidence to support the accusations, and later fine d him $45,000. 124 Unable to pay such a large fine, Furci left Saigon . Crum later bragged that he had \"paid for\" the raid that had"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" 100 eliminated his competitor. 125 Furci moved to Hong Kong and in August opened a res taurant named the San Francisco Steak House with nominal ca pital of $100,000. 126 More importantly, Furci was instrumental in the formation of Maradern Ltd., a company that the Augs burg sergeants who managed NCO clubs in Vietnam used to increase illegal profits from the military clubs. Although F urci's name does not appear on any of the incorporation papers, it s eems that he was the \"silent partner\" in the classic Mafia sense of the term. 127 Maradem Ltd, was not a wholesale supplier or retail outlet, but a broker that used its control over NCO clubs and bas e mess halls to force legitimate wholesalers to pay a fixed perc entage of their profits in order to do business. 128 Maradem's competitors were gradually \"squeezed out\" of business, and in its fi rst year of operation the company did $1,210,000 worth of busin ess with NCO clubs in Vietnam. 129 By 1968 Frank Furci had gained three years of valua ble experience in the shadow world of Hong Kong and Ind ochina; he was friendly with powerful Corsican syndicate leade rs in Saigon and had the opportunity to form similar relationshi ps with chiu chau bosses in Hong Kong. 130 Thus, perhaps it is not too surprising that the boss himself, Santo Trafficante , Jr., did Furci the honor of visiting him in Hong Kong in 1968. Acc ompanied by Frank's father, Dominick Furci, Trafficante was que stioned by Hong Kong authorities regarding the purpose of his visit, and according to a U.S. Senate investigation, he explai ned that \"They were traveling around the world together at the tim e. They stopped to visit Furci, Frank Furci in Hong Kong an d to visit his restaurant .... 131 After a leisurely stopover, Trafficante proceeded t o Saigon, 132 where, according to U.S. Embassy sources, he met wi th some prominent Corsican gangsters. 133 Trafficante was not the first of Lansky's chief lieutenants to visit Hong Kong. In A pril 1965 John Pullman, Lansky's courier and financial expert, pai d an extended visit to Hong Kong, where he reportedly investigate d the narcotics and gambling rackets. 134 Although the few Mafia watchers who are aware of Tr afficante's journey to Asia have always been mystified by it, t here is good reason to believe that it was a response to the cri sis in the Mediterranean drug traffic and an attempt to secure new sources of heroin for Mafia distributors inside the United States. With almost 70 Percent of the world's illicit opium supp ly in the Golden Triangle, skilled heroin chemists in Hong Kong, and entrenched Corsican syndicates in Indochina, Southeast Asia wa s a logical"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 101 choice. Soon after Trafficante's visit to Hong Kong, a Fili pino courier ring started delivering Hong Kong heroin to Mafia distri butors in the United States. In 1970 U.S. narcotics agents arrest ed many of these couriers. Subsequent interrogation revealed t hat the ring had successfully smuggled one thousand kilos of pur e heroin into the United States—the equivalent of 10 to 20 percen t of America's annual consumption. Current U.S. Bureau of Narcotics intelligence repor ts indicate that another courier ring is bringing Hong Kong heroin i nto the United States through the Caribbean, Trafficante's territo ry. From Hong Kong heroin is usually flown to Chile on regular fl ights and then smuggled across the border into Paraguay in light, private aircraft. 135 In the late 1960s Paraguay became the major transi t point for heroin entering the United States from La tin America; both Hong Kong and Southeast Asian heroin smuggled across the Pacific into Chile and European heroin smuggled across the Atlantic into Argentina are shipped to Paraguay bef ore being forwarded to the United States. Argentina and Parag uay are popular refuges for Marseille gangsters wanted in F rance for serious crimes. The most prominent of these is Augu ste Joseph Ricord, a Marseille-born gangster who worked with t he Gestapo during World War 11. Using a variety of means rangi ng from private aircraft to stuffed artifacts, Ricord is be lieved to have smuggled some 2.5 billion dollars' worth of heroin into the United States from Argentina and Paraguay in the last five years. 136 Although law enforcement officials have always assu med that Ricord and his associates were being supplied from Marseille, current reports of shipments from Hong Kong and Sou theast Asia to Paraguay have raised the possibility that their sources may have shifted to Asia in recent years. 137 (Alfred W.

In mid-April 1971 a Panamanian government official, Joaquim Him-Gonzales, was apprehended by American narcotics agents and tried in the Federal Court in Dallas, Texas for conspiracy to smuggle heroin into the Uni ted States. Also tried in the same case were J. D.

Robertson had a mysterious background. He had been president of the Robertson Aircraft Company of Dallas and had been an executiv e of the major international airline for eleven years. But many people in Dallas believed that Robertson may have been a CIA operative. This was never established, b ut in Dallas circles, it was observed that Robertson and the two or three compan ies he had formed in recent years flew some unusual trips into Latin America. 139 As the government prosecutors built cases against H im-Gonzales, Vicars, and Robertson, the latter became hysterical. On Friday, April 23, 1971, Robertson fell apart on the witness stand and ran from his seat sh outing, \"I can’t tell the truth under these conditions.\" Federal Judge Sarah T. Hughes re sponded sternly, \"No! You get back on the stand. You are just putting on a show f or the jury. Now you collect yourself and get back up here on the stand.\" She la ter had Robertson undergo a psychiatric examination, which found him fully capa ble to stand trial. 140 The following Monday Robertson seemed even more unb alanced, babbling over and over again, \"I am Judge Sarah T. Hughes ... I am John F. Kennedy. I was assassinated in Dallas, Judge Sarah T. Hughes, on November 23, 1 963 ... I am a sinner, I am a sinner.\" 141 Despite Robertson’s erratic behavior, the jury foun d the threesome—Robertson, Him- Gonzalez, and Vicars—guilty two days later; however , Robertson was never sentenced. He died in his cell at the Dallas County jail four days after he was convicted. April 26, 1971 a deputy marshal gave swo rn testimony that Robertson had told him, \"I will be dead in five days.\" He was off by one day. 142 Transcript of Colonel Prouty’s Interview From The M en Who Killed Kennedy Colonel Fletcher Prouty made some interesting comme nts about the techniques employed to kill President Kennedy and how the crim e was covered up afterwards. Here is the transcript of his remarks from The Men Who Killed Kennedy : Narrator: But the Mafia could hardly have acted alone, given the intricacy of the assassination plot and the strength of the c over-up for twenty-five years. Colonel Fletcher Prouty was Chie f of Special Operations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during Kenn edy’s presidency. He believes even more powerful forces w ere ultimately responsible. [Scene switches to Colonel Prouty:]"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" 103 Colonel Prouty: I think without any question, it’s what we called \" the use of hired gunmen.\" And this isn’t new. In fact, this little m anual here [Prouty holds up a manual entitled Clandestine Operations M anual for Central America] which is called the Assassination Manual for Latin America contains a line which says, talking a bout Latin America [reading] \"If possible, professional crimin als will be hired to carry out specific selective ‘jobs.’ \" --- Jobs in quote which means murders. Well, if this manual for Latin Ameri ca, printed within the last few years in a government manual sa ys that, there’s no question but what the application of the same technique was dated back in Kennedy’s time. In fact I know from my own experience. You know I was in that business in those days. So, with that knowledge, you begin to realize that hired criminals, the way this book says, can be hired by anybody in power with sufficient money to pay them, but more importantly with sufficient power to operate the cover-up ever after. Because y ou see it’s one thing to kill somebody. It’s another thing to c over-up the fact that you did it, or that you hired somebody to do i t; and that’s more difficult. So they used the device of the Warr en Commission Report to cover-up their hired killers. Now who wou ld hire the killers, and who has the power to put that Warren C ommission Report out over the top of the whole story? You see you’re dealing with a very high echelon of power. It doesn ’t necessarily reside in any government. It doesn’t necessarily re side in any single corporate institution. But it seems to resid e in a blend of the two. Otherwise, how could you have gotten peopl e like the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to participate i n the cover-up? The police in Dallas to participate in the cover-up ? Et cetera. And the media. All the media , not just one or two newspapers; but none of them will print the story other than Oswald killed the President with three bullets, which is totally untr ue. ( The Men Who Killed Kennedy – The Forces of Darkness , N. Turner) The \"high echelon of power\" to which Colonel Prouty referred is not as mysterious and elusive as he made it seem. It is merely Jewish political forces and friends of Israel within the United States and other governmen ts. Those were the forces who sponsored the assassination of President Kennedy. It must also be noted that Colonel Prouty’s final c omment about the media is no longer valid. He stated that the news media will on ly report that \"Oswald killed the President with three bullets.\" That was a factual s tatement when he made it in 1988. But since then, the news media has retreated from t he official lie for fear of losing credibility—a small victory, but a victory nonethel ess after thirty-plus years.

Garrison eloquently summarized his feelings about Oswald in an intervie w included in Nigel Turner’s 1988 documentary, The Men Who Killed Kennedy : Lee Oswald was totally, unequivocally, completely i nnocent of the assassination. And the fact that history—or in the rewriting of history and disinformation—has made a villain of th is young man, who wanted nothing more than to be a fine Marine, i s in some ways the greatest injustice of all. 1 Buell Wesley Frazier, Oswald’s friend and co-worker at the Texas School Book Depository, made the following comments, in The Men Who Killed Kennedy , about his deceased young friend: The individual that I know as Lee Harvey Oswald, I don’t think had it in him to be a person capable of committing such a crime as murdering the President of the United States. I’ ll always believe that. The side I saw [of] him was a very ki nd and loving man. And that’s the way I’d like to remember him. 2 Garrison gave extensive interviews for The Men Who Killed Kennedy . That same year, 1988, Garrison wrote and published a book, On the Trail of the Assassins , which thoroughly exonerated Oswald through presentation o f facts and deductive reasoning. The book focused on Garrison’s prosecution of Clay Shaw in 1969 and it provided many new facts about the assassination never before released to the public. Garrison was philosophical about the 1969 verdict that acqui tted Shaw of conspiracy to murder President Kennedy. The following is an excerpt from the introduction of On the Trail of the Assassins : History has a way of changing verdicts. Twenty-five years ago most Americans readily accepted the government’s co ntention that the assassination was a random act of violence . A lonely young man, his mind steeped in Marxist ideology, ap parently frustrated at his inability to do anything well, ha d crouched at a warehouse window and—in six seconds of world class shooting—destroyed the President of the United Stat es. ... The assassination was an enormously important event . But even more important, in my view, is what happened after— ratification by the government and the media of an official stor y that is an absurd fairy tale. Immediately after the assassination, the federal go vernment and"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 109 the major media adopted the posture of two giant os triches, each unyielding to reason, each with its head firmly lod ged in the sand. Having ratified the lone assassin theory, they refu sed to acknowledge any facts that might discredit it and a ttacked anyone who offered a different explanation. (Jim Garrison, On the Trail of the Assassins , pp. XII - XIII) On the Trail of the Assassins was a best seller and became the basis for a Holly wood movie, JFK (1991), by Oliver Stone. Garrison’s words were pro phetic indeed. History does have a way of changing verdicts. By the mid-19 90s, the American news media essentially stopped blaming Oswald for the assassin ation. In fact, most modern documentaries about President Kennedy no longer men tion Oswald at all. Few journalists or scholars will openly admit that they believe the Warren Report any longer for fear of losing credibility. Garrison pro vided so many facts exonerating Oswald that it became impossible for the various me dia outlets to continue supporting \"the great lie.\" Consequently, the media adopted a paradoxical position regarding the assassination. While most media outlets no longer o vertly endorse to the Warren Commission’s conclusion that Oswald alone killed Ke nnedy, they still support it indirectly by promoting \"non-journalists\" who write , disseminate, and proselytize archaic propaganda in support of what Garrison accu rately labeled \"an absurd fairy tale.\" Gerald Posner is a prime example. ( Footnote 11 ) Posner appears regularly on television and radio ta lk shows, and is often quoted in major newspapers. His primary claim to fame is his strong opinion that the Warren Commission was correct in its conclusion that Oswal d alone killed President Kennedy. According to Posner, Americans have been confused a nd brainwashed by people like Jim Garrison and Oliver Stone who filled their head s with silly conspiracy theories. It is interesting, however, that Posner himself suppor ts the biggest conspiracy theory of the Twentieth Century—that Adolf Hitler had a maste rplan to exterminate six million Jews in gas chambers. Posner would have us believe that some conspiracies—ones chosen by him—are acceptable, but believing \"unsanc tioned\" conspiracy theories is tantamount to having a mental breakdown. The media’s support of people like Posner is a cyni cal form of damage control. Media moguls and journalists are fully aware that the Ame rican public no longer believes the Warren Report, but rather than admit they actively supported a lie, they get Posner and other non-journalists to support their old posi tion. By using this approach, the lie continues to propagate, but if a backlash occurs ag ainst the messengers of that lie, then the media outlets have a layer of deniability. After all, Posner is technically an independent writer, not a journalist. And like most proselytizers of the Warren Report, Posner is Jewish. This supports my overall thesis t hat Kennedy’s murder was in fact a worldwide Jewish conspiracy sponsored by the World Jewish Congress and actively supported by friends of Israel in all nations. I will have more comments about Gerald Posner later . For now, we will focus on the exoneration of Lee Harvey Oswald. Several facts poi nt to Oswald’s \"total, unequivocal, and complete innocence,\" to quote Garr ison."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" 110 First of all, Garrison revealed that Oswald had bee n trained to speak Russian while in the Marines. Oswald also received training from the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). In fact, Oswald took a Russian examination w hile stationed at El Toro Marine base. 3 Oswald had been stationed there from November 1958 through September 1959. 4 The mere fact that Oswald was trained to speak Rus sian strongly suggests that he was an intelligence operative, probably working for Naval Intelligence. He was apparently carrying out orders given from his super iors that would ultimately be used to implicate him in the murder of President Kennedy . In other words, Oswald was set up as a \"patsy.\" Second point: Garrison revealed that Oswald’s defec tion to the Soviet Union was extremely suspicious and was likely sponsored by th e CIA and/or the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). While in the Marines, Oswald wo rked at Atsugi Air Base in Japan in 1957. Atsugi was the base where all daily super- secret U-2 intelligence flights over China originated. Oswald’s unit—which required a hi ghly classified security clearance—guarded the U-2 hangar. In the summer of 1959, Oswald applied for a dischar ge from the Marines. In September of that year he was given an honorable di scharge. He then visited his mother briefly in Fort Worth, Texas, then went to N ew Orleans. From there he departed for the Soviet Union by steamship to Engla nd; his ticket had been obtained by the Lykes office of Clay Shaw’s organization—the International Trade Mart in New Orleans. From England he flew eastward to the H elsinki, Finland although the exact air service is unknown. From Helsinki, Oswald took a train to Moscow, arriving on October 16, 1959. He immediately made a series o f contacts with Soviet officials and underwent extensive interrogation by the Soviet s. Two weeks later, Oswald went to the American Embassy in Moscow and handed over h is passport and a letter renouncing the United States and declaring allegian ce to the Soviet Union. In April of 1961, Oswald married Marina Prusakova, the niece of a lieutenant colonel in the Soviet Union’s domestic intelligence service . About three months earlier, Oswald had applied at the American Embassy in Mosco w to return to the United States. Unbelievably, both governments agreed that Oswald and his new Russian bride could return to America. This was at the heig ht of the Cold War. Even though Oswald had defected to the Soviet Union, the US Sta te Department did not consider him a threat. In fact, it authorized the American E mbassy in Moscow to loan him some money—$436, to be exact—for his return. In June of 1962, Lee and Marina Oswald arrived in N ew York with their young daughter. They were not required to meet with FBI a gents, or any law enforcement officers or employees of any agency. Keep in mind t hat prior to defecting to the Soviet Union, Oswald had performed highly classifie d work at Atsugi Air Base in Japan in 1957—guarding the U-2 hangar where U-2 air craft was launched for spy missions over China. The fact that he was allowed t o re-enter the United States with no questions asked strongly suggests that his stay in the East was sponsored by the US intelligence community. Although the Oswalds were n ot questioned by government authorities when they re-entered New York in 1962, they did, however, meet with Spas T. Raikin, head of the American Friends of the Anti-Bolshevik Nations, Inc., a private anti-communist group with extensive intelli gence connections. 5 "},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" 111 Third point: Garrison and others revealed that Oswa ld was friends with George de Mohrenschildt—of Dallas—and his wife, Jeanne. After the Oswalds returned to the United States from the Soviet Union in June of 1962 , they moved to Fort Worth, Texas where Lee worked at the Leslie Welding Compan y until October 7, 1962. That evening, the Oswalds were visited by Mr. And Mrs. d e Mohrenschildt. The next day, Lee packed up and moved to Dallas. De Mohrenschildt was apparently an intelligence operative and had given Oswald instructions to move . 6 De Mohrenschildt was both a friend and apparently a CIA \"babysitter\" to Oswald during his stay in Dallas. A babysitter is a term used by American Intelligence agencies to describe an agent assigned to attend the needs of a particular indivi dual important to the completion of a mission. 7 This is the only plausible explanation for how two men of such vastly different backgrounds could have been friends or ac quaintances. De Mohrenschildt was a Russian-born immigrant who c ame to the United States with his parents after the Russian Revolution in 1917. D e Mohrenschildt was born on April 17, 1911 in Mozyr, a small Baltic town in czarist R ussia near the Polish border. 8 His father, Baron Serguis de Mohrenschildt, had been go vernor of the province of Minsk for Czar Nicholas Romanov. George De Mohrenschildt spoke Russian, German, Spanish, French, and Polish. In World War II he wor ked for French intelligence. 9 His connection with French intelligence is highly signi ficant given the information presented in Chapter 5 about the French-Corsican un derworld and French intelligence. De Mohrenschildt, a refined member of the jet set, held a doctorate in international commerce and a masters degree in petroleum engineer ing and geology. He became a consulting geologist and was a member of the exclus ive Dallas Petroleum Club. There he made contacts with extremely affluent people in the business world. 10 De Mohrenschildt apparently provided sensitive info rmation to Warren Commission investigators in 1964. His statements were document ed and classified as \"secret\" (reference Commission Document 1222). 11 On March 29, 1977, de Mohrenschildt was found dead of a gunshot blast to the head at his sister-in-law’s fashionable home in Manalapa n, Florida. His death was ruled suicide. 12 He died three hours after arranging to meet invest igator, Gaeton Fonzi ( Footnote 12 ) , from the House Select Committee on Assassinations . 13 Earlier that day, de Mohrenschildt had met with author Edward Ja y Epstein. 14 Epstein is a highly suspicious individual. In 1969, he wrote Counterplot which attacked Garrison and his prosecution of Clay Shaw. Epstein wrote another propagandistic book, Legend (1978), which pushed the cover story that the Sovi et KGB sponsored the Kennedy assassination, and that O swald was working for them. In 1966, Epstein wrote Inquest , a mild critique of the Warren Report. Author Mich ael Collins Piper wrote the following critique of Inquest : Interesting, Epstein also wrote the book Inquest that was hailed by the media as an important critique of the Warren Commission Report. However, I’ve always felt that this volume was an Establishment \"cover story\" suggesting that while t here were problems with the way the Warren Commission conduct ed its"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 112 investigation, there was nothing to worry about in the end. In any case, none of Epstein’s books are of any real value . 15 Given Epstein’s propensity to write propaganda, his apparent ethnicity, and the fact that he met with de Mohrenschildt shortly before th e latter’s death, it seems highly possible that de Mohrenschildt may have inadvertent ly told Epstein of his plans to meet with an investigator— Gaeton Fonzi—with the Ho use Select Committee on Assassinations. Epstein apparently passed this info rmation to the criminal elements who killed Kennedy. Given de Mohrenschildt’s prior history of talking to the feds in 1964, a quick decision was apparently made to silen ce him permanently. Researcher William Torbitt made an interesting obse rvation about de Mohrenschildt in his article entitled, Nomenclature of an Assassination Cabal . The following is an excerpt from that article: Many examiners of the case have concluded that Geor ge DeMohrenschildt was a part of the conspiracy becaus e of his close association with Oswald during the fall of 19 62, and winter and early spring of 1963, but a close reading of th e Russian exile's testimony before the Warren Commission show s that DeMohrenschildt was being used by the Solidarists t he same as Oswald was being used, and was to have been tied in with Oswald; in connection with the assassination. Howev er, DeMohrenschildt, a highly polished professional geo logist, saved himself by moving to Haiti in April of 1963 in conn ection with a contract with the government of Haiti, where he sti ll resided on the day of the assassination of President Kennedy. DeMohrenschildt, in retrospect, knew that Division Five of the FBI and the Solidarists had intended to use him as a sc apegoat along with Oswald, and he did not hesitate to name the sm all group within the Federal Bureau of Investigation as the i nstigators of the assassination of President Kennedy. 16 Fourth point: Garrison and others revealed that Osw ald performed top-secret work for \"Jagger-Stovall-Chiles\" while living in Dallas duri ng the Cuban Missile Crisis (October 1962). As previously stated, Oswald moved to Dallas on October 8, 1962. Before the month was over he had secured a job at J agger-Stovall-Chiles, a Dallas company under contract with the Pentagon to produce maps and charts for military use. The job required an extremely high security cl earance. Oswald was given access to various classified materials. Writer Henry Hurt observed that \"part of the work appeared to be related to the top-secret U-2 missio ns, some of which were making flights over Cuba.\" 17 Fifth point: Garrison demonstrated that Oswald had an association with Guy Banister, a retired FBI agent with ONI experience who lived i n New Orleans working as a private detective. During the summer of 1963, Oswal d handed out pro-Castro leaflets on the streets of New Orleans. Oswald’s organizatio n was called \"Fair Play for Cuba.\""},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" 113 On August 9, 1963, Oswald was arrested during a scu ffle with anti-Castro Cubans. The pro-Castro leaflets that Oswald handed out that day—and that day only—had the address \"544 Camp Street\" (New Orleans) stamped on them. Garrison revealed that 544 Camp Street was an entrance to the same buildin g where Guy Banister had worked as a private detective, but the entrance to Banister’s office was 531 Lafayette Street. Oswald had apparently stamped 544 Camp Stre et on his pro-Castro leaflets by mistake on August 9, but Banister—or one of his ass ociates—apparently stopped him from continuing the practice. It was obviously emba rrassing for a retired FBI agent to be linked to pro-Castro activity. Oswald had appare ntly worked closely with Banister, who died of a heart attack in 1964, about nine mont hs after the assassination. 18 Sixth point: Garrison demonstrated that Oswald had an association with Clay Shaw. As previously stated, Garrison proved that Shaw had called New Orleans attorney Dean Andrews on November 23, 1963 and asked him to represent Oswald. Andrews testified before a grand jury and denied that Bertr and and Shaw were the same person. The grand jury subsequently indicted him for perjur y. In August 1967, he was convicted of perjury by a jury of New Orleans citiz ens. 19 This was a significant victory for Garrison because the true identity of C lay Bertrand/Shaw was one of the main points that caused the jury to acquit Shaw of conspiracy to murder President Kennedy. Another point that Garrison failed to show was Shaw’s CIA connections, but in 1979, Richard Helms—the CIA’s director for c overt operations in 1963— admitted under oath that Shaw had Agency connection s. 20 Although Garrison lost the case against Shaw, truth had ultimately prevailed. Seventh point: Garrison and others proved that othe r men murdered Dallas policeman J. D. Tippet. This is an important point because it refutes much of the rationale behind the Warren Commission’s conclusion that Oswald kill ed Kennedy. A member of the Warren Commission’s legal staff asked the following rhetorical question and supplied the answer: \"How do we know that Lee Harvey Oswald killed President Kennedy? Because he killed Officer Tippet.\" Garrison pointed out that the reverse is also true: \"Only a man who had just killed the President and k new he was being hunted down would have any reason to shoot a police officer in a quiet suburb at mid-day.\" 21 Garrison proved through deductive reasoning that th ere was not enough time for Oswald to have left his rooming house at 1:00 pm an d shot Tippet at 1:06 or 1:10 pm. The housekeeper/landlady at the rooming house obser ved Oswald standing by the northbound Beckly Avenue bus stop at 1:04. The loca tion where Tippet was killed was in the opposite direction, about a mile south. The Warren Commission ignored the time discrepancies. Witnesses to the Tippet kil ling gave conflicting testimony about the physical appearance of the shooter. In fa ct, Acquilla Clemons stated that she saw two men working together, although only one was the trigger-man. Neither man fit Oswald’s description. 22 Eighth point: Garrison revealed that Oswald was a p oor marksman in the Marines. As previously stated, Oswald closest colleague in the Marines, Nelson Delgado, stated that Oswald was not sharpshooter material. The foll owing is an excerpt of Delgado’s testimony before Warren Commission attorney Wesley J. Liebeler: Liebeler: You told the FBI that in your opinion Osw ald was not a"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" 114 good rifle shot, is that correct? Delgado: Yes. Liebeler: And that he did not show any unusual inte rest in his rifle, and in fact appeared less interested in weap ons than the average Marine? Delgado: Yes. He was mostly a thinker, a reader. He read quite a bit. 23 Ninth point: Garrison demonstrated that the gun Osw ald allegedly used could not have been a Mannlicher-Carcano, as the government c laimed. First of all, the government claimed that Oswald—a poor marksman—fire d three shots in 6 seconds, killing President Kennedy and gravely wounding Gove rnor Connally. But no ammunition clip was ever found for the Mannlicher-C arcano. The clip feeds cartridges into the rifle’s firing chamber. Without a clip, the cartridges would have to be loaded manually, making fast shooting impossible . In addition, the Mannlicher- Carcano produced as the murder weapon had a badly m isaligned sight. It needed an adjustment before government riflemen could complet e their test firing. Even with the adjustment, no rifle expert was able to duplicate O swald’s alleged shooting prowess. 24 Garrison also made some interesting comments about the rifle found at the School Book Depository by Dallas police: Officer Seymour Weitzman, part of the Dallas police search team, later described the discovery of the rifle on the a fternoon of November 22. He stated that it had been so well hid den under boxes of books that the officers stumbled over it m any times before they found it. Officer Weitzmann, who had an engineering degree and also operated a sporting goods store, wa s recognized as an authority on weapons. Consequently , Dallas Homicide Chief Will Fritz, who was on the scene, as ked him the make of the rifle. Weitzman identified it as a 7.65 Mauser, a highly accurate German-made weapon. Deputy Sheriff Roger Craig was also there and later recalled the word \"M auser\" inscribed in the metal of the gun. And Deputy Sheri ff Eugene Boone executed a sworn affidavit in which he descri bed the rifle as a Mauser. As late as midnight November 22, Dalla s District Attorney Henry Wade told the media that the weapon found was a Mauser. ... when the smoke cleared and all the law enforcemen t authorities in Dallas had their stories duly in ord er, the official position was that the rifle found on the sixth floo r of the Depository was the Mannlicher-Carcano, which allege dly was linked to Oswald under an alias, and not the Mauser , which disappeared forever shortly after it reached the ha nds of Captain"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" 115 Fritz. But even this revision of the official story did no t explain the third rifle. A film taken by Dallas Cinema Associates, an independent film company, showed a scene of the Book Depository shortly after the assassination. Police officers on the fir e escape were bringing down a rifle from the roof above the sixth floor with the tender care you might give an infant. When the poli cemen reached the ground, a high-ranking officer held the rifle high for everyone to see. The camera zoomed in for a close-u p. Beneath the picture was the legend, \"The Assassin’s Rifle.\" When I saw the film, I noted that this rifle had no sight moun ted on it. Thus it could not have been either the Carcano or the vanis hed Mauser, both of which had sights. I was not surprised to find that this third rifle, like the Mauser, had disappeared. But its existence confirmed my hypothe sis that Lee Oswald could not have killed John Kennedy as the Am erican public had been told. Setting aside the evidence of two other weapons on the scene, the incredibly accurate shoot ing of an incredibly inaccurate rifle within an impossible ti me frame was merely the beginning of the feat we were asked to b elieve Oswald had accomplished. (Jim Garrison, On the Trail of the Assassins , pp. 113 - 115) The government disregarded the testimony of several witnesses in order to link Oswald to the murder weapon. One such witness was B uell Wesley Frazier, a friend of Oswald’s and co-worker at the Texas School Book Depository. On November 21 Oswald got Frazier to drive him to the home of Ruth and Michael Paine—in Irving, Texas—where Marina Oswald was living (they were sep arated ( Footnote 13 ) ). Oswald told Frazier that Marina had made some curtains for him to put in his apartment and she had some curtain rods for him to pick up. Oswald sp ent the night at Paine’s house and caught a ride to work with Frazier the next morning . Under his arm he carried a brown paper package. The Warren Commission conclude d that the package contained the rifle (Mannlicher-Carcano) used to kill Preside nt Kennedy. Frazier testified about the package before the Warren Commission. Years lat er he described it in The Men Who Killed Kennedy : Frazier: The first time I saw the package it was on the back seat of my car and I had just glanced at it. And I asked, ‘What’s that, Lee?’ And he said, ‘That’s curtain rods. Remember, I was goin g to bring them.’ The length of the package that I saw that mo rning was roughly two foot long, give or take an inch or two. And it was made out of same type of packing material that you would find in any company that packed materials for shipment. It was just"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" 116 brown paper and the tape that you would normally fi nd, nothing unusual. ... I parked in the parking lot at the Texas School Boo k Depository. Lee got out of the car, took the package that he sa id contained curtain rods and he put one end of the package in t he cup of his hand and the other [end] up under his armpit. He pu t the package under his arm that way and he walked off toward the Texas School Book Depository up on Elm Street. Narrator: The package could not have contained Oswald’s rifle . Even when dismantled it was three feet long. The Warren Commi ssioners, who investigated the assassination, ignored Frazier ’s unswerving testimony, insisting the weapon had been smuggled i nto the Depository in Oswald’s brown paper parcel. 25 Tenth point: Garrison revealed that Oswald took a \" nitrate\" test which indicated he had not fired a rifle on November 22, 1963. This is the most compelling evidence that exonerated Oswald. He was given the nitrate test on the evening of the assassination. Had he fired a rifle that day, the test would have revealed deposits of nitrate on his cheek. This information was kept secret for ten mon ths but was revealed in the Warren Report. 26 The government had trouble linking the Mannlicher-C arcano rifle directly to Oswald. But a smudged palm-print was discovered on the murd er weapon hours after Federal agents made a mysterious visit to the funeral home where Oswald’s body had been taken by mortician Paul Grudy. Grudy explained what happened in an interview shown in The Men Who Killed Kennedy : I had gotten to the funeral home with his body some thing in the neighborhood of eleven o’clock at night and it is a several hour procedure to prepare the remains. And after this ti me, some place in the early, early morning, agents came. Now I say agents because I’m not familiar, at the moment, with wheth er they were Secret Service or FBI or what they were. But agents did come. And when they did come, they fingerprinted. And the only reason that we knew they did, they were carrying a satchel and equipment and asked us if they might have the prepa ration room to themselves. And after it was all over, we found ink on Lee Harvey’s hands showing that they had fingerprinted him and palm-printed him. We had to take that ink back off in order to prepare him for burial and to eliminate that ink. 27 Eleventh point: Garrison and others provided compel ling arguments that the government manufactured fake photographs of Oswald holding a Mannlicher-Carcano rifle as a means of linking him to the murder weapo n. ( Footnote 14 ) In Garrison’s 1988"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" 117 book, On the Trail of the Assassins , he cited Robert Groden’s \"dissent\" to the House Select Committee on Assassinations that challenged the authenticity of the photographs of Oswald. The HSCA had concluded that the photos were genuine. Groden was the photographic consultant to the HSCA. His dissent was hidden from public view until Garrison revealed it to the world in his 1988 best seller. Here is an excerpt of Groden’s dissent: ...in my opinion, no matter what the panel members co ncluded, the backyard photographs are beyond question fakes... For the record, the method used here was, almost without do ubt, simply posing a man... in the backyard with a rifle, pistol and publications as part of this original picture. The only item added was the head of Lee Oswald from the middle of the c hin up... 28 It should be emphasized that although Groden wrote his dissent in the 1970s, he did not publish any books about the Kennedy assassinati on until after Jim Garrison wrote On the Trail of the Assassins in 1988. A year later, in 1989, Groden published a book entitled High Treason . In 1994, Groden published The Killing of a President . A year after that, in 1995, Groden published The Search for Lee Harvey Oswald . Although technically Groden challenged the authenticity of t he photographs of Oswald in the 1970s, he sat on this critical information for year s (apparently it was deliberate). But through Jim Garrison’s 1988 book, Groden’s dissent was finally read by millions. I shall have more comments about Robert Groden later. Garrison also noted that in the photographs of Oswa ld, his head did not match his neck and body. Furthermore, Oswald’s facial \"portra it\" was exactly the same in several photographs, but his posture and the distan ce from the camera changed from picture to picture. In addition, if one uses Oswald ’s face as a standard of measurement, then Oswald was significantly taller in one picture . 29 The photographs of Oswald holding the murder weapon were found in Ruth Paine’s garage in Irving, Texas. As previously stated, Mari na Oswald had been living with Paine—apart from her husband, Lee—at the time of th e assassination. Garrison checked Ruth Paine’s background and discovered that she and her husband Michael Paine had strong ties to the intelligence community . Lee and Marina Oswald had met Ruth Paine in February 1963 at a party in Dallas. T he Oswalds were taken to the party by George de Mohrenschildt and his wife. This is hi ghly significant. Most researchers agree that de Mohrenschildt was one of Oswald’s CIA /ONI handlers. Given that, it seems probable that Ruth Paine was involved in the conspiracy as well. She supplied the authorities with incriminating photographs—like ly fakes—of Oswald holding the murder weapon. Michael Paine was a design engineer who performed h ighly classified worked for Bell Helicopter, ( Footnote 15 ) a major defense contractor. Ruth Paine was an inte lligent woman who constantly wandered around the country and the world for one reason or another. One of her many interests was the Russian language. Naturally this made her fast friends with Marina Oswald, a Russian immigrant. Pa ine’s father had been employed by the Agency for International Development, regard ed by many as a CIA front"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":" 118 organization. Her brother-in-law worked for the sam e agency in the Washington, DC area. 30 Twelfth point: Garrison established that Oswald was not a Marxist as the Warren Commission concluded. Garrison summarized his feeli ngs about Oswald’s political leanings as follows: The more I thought about it, the more the great dis parity gnawed at me. There had been the Lee Harvey Oswald who, th e government told us, was close to being the most rab id communist since Lenin. On the other hand, at our very doorste p, there had been a flesh-and-blood Oswald who used as the headq uarters for his pamphleteering the office of Guy Banister—forme rly of the FBI and Naval Intelligence and, more recently, the Anti- Communist League of the Caribbean. As if that were not enough, Oswald had been on a first-name basis with that swa shbuckling anti-communist soldier of fortune, David Ferrie, a man who had trained anti-Castro pilots for the Bay of Pigs in 1 961 and by 1963 was giving guerilla training to more Cuban exiles f or some new venture against the island. (Jim Garrison, On the Trail of the Assassins , p. 50) John E. Donovan (a first lieutenant at El Toro when Oswald was there) testified before the Warren Commission stating emphatically t hat Oswald did not have leftist political leanings. Donovan stated the following: \" I never heard him in any way, shape or form confess that he was a Communist, or t hat he ever thought about being a Communist.\" 31 Nelson Delgado was closest to Oswald in the Marine s. They bunked next to each other for about 11 months. Delgado tol d the Warren Commission that Oswald \"never said any subversive things... and he di dn’t show [any] particular aspects of being a sharpshooter at all.\" 32 Garrison provided mountains of additional evidence demonstrating that although Oswald distrib uted pro-Castro leaflets, he was not truly a Marxist; but was merely a low-level int elligence operative—an agent provocateur —playing the role of a Marxist. 33 Several other friends and associates of Oswald’s at the El Toro Marine base gave similar testimony before the Warren Commission that Oswald was not a Marxist. They included Donald Peter Camarata, Peter Francis Connor, Allen Graf, John Rene Heindel, Mack Osborne, and Richard Dennis Call. Onl y one man—Kerry Thornley— stated that Oswald had exhibited Marxist leanings. Consequently, the Warren Commission ignored the testimonies of the other men and released Thornley’s statements to the media. 34 Garrison provided circumstantial evidence that Thor nley had doubled as Oswald doing things to incriminate the latter. Thornley bo re a striking resemblance to Oswald and they were about the same height, although Oswal d was slightly taller. Garrison observed that Thornley had lied to the Warren Commi ssion about Oswald’s height. Thornley told the Warren Commission that Oswald was about five inches shorter than himself—who was five feet ten inches—when in realit y Oswald was taller. In 1968,"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" 119 Garrison had a Grand Jury subpoena Thornley who was living in Tampa, Florida at the time. Thornley admitted that he lived in New Or leans from February 1961 through the end of November 1963, shortly after the assassi nation. He also admitted to meeting Guy Banister and David Ferrie while in New Orleans, but denied meeting Oswald during his stay in New Orleans. In addition, Thornley lived in the heart of the New Orleans intelligence community during his time in that city. 35 Thornley also told Garrison that in the late spring of 1963, around early May, he took a bus trip to California to visit his parents, and had visited Dallas briefly during that journey. In late April, the Oswalds had just moved from their Neely Street apartment in Dallas to New Orleans leaving the rent still pai d for. Consequently, Oswald’s apartment was unoccupied for a few days. Garrison s uggested that during that time, Thornley may have posed for the incriminating \"fake \" photographs of Oswald holding a rifle and pistol. The incriminating photos were t aken of someone with a build similar to Oswald’s standing in the backyard of the Neely Street apartment. 36 Thirteenth point: Garrison demonstrated that Oswald did not make trips to Mexico City, but the CIA had provided the Warren Commissio n with a fake photograph of him at the Cuban Embassy in that city. The Warren C ommission used the alleged trip to Mexico City from September 16 through October 3, 1963 as further proof that Oswald was a communist. The Warren Report stated th at Oswald \"embarked on a series of visits to the Soviet and Cuban Embassies\" in Mexico City, that his objective was \"to reach Cuba by way of Mexico, and that he ho ped to meet Fidel Castro after he arrived.\" The Warren Report further stated that Sil via Tirado de Duran, a Mexican employee at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City, recal led an American named Lee Harvey Oswald trying to obtain a visa to Cuba in th e latter part of September or the early part of October. The Warren Commission includ ed an extensive statement from Duran in its final report. 37 Garrison wrote the following devastating response t o the Warren Commission’s assertion—a tale apparently manufactured by the CIA —that Oswald had visited the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico City: Early in the official inquiry, the CIA informed the Warren Commission of Oswald’s alleged activities in Mexico City before the assassination. Uncharacteristically, the Commis sion asked for more evidence. Perhaps the Commission members, aware that the Agency had 24-hour photographic surveillan ce of the Cuban and Soviet embassies in Mexico City, were hop ing for a good picture to shore up their sparsely documented account of Oswald’s trip to Mexico. Initially, the Agency ignored the Commission’s requ est. But after more pressure, the CIA finally handed over a murky snapshot of a portly, graying gentleman almost old enough to be Oswald’s father. This, the Agency claimed, was Lee Harvey Os wald at the Cuban Embassy. The Agency also produced a statement from Silvia Du ran, a"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 120 Mexican who worked at the Cuban Embassy, alleging t hat Oswald had appeared there. However, the circumstanc es under which the statement was obtained were tainted, to s ay the least. On the day of the assassination, the CIA ordered au thorities to arrest Duran and keep her in isolation. ( Footnote 16 ) The Agency cable said: \"With full regard for Mexican interests , request you ensure that her arrest is kept absolutely secret, t hat no information from her is published or leaked, that a ll such info is cabled to us...\" Duran was not released until she ide ntified Lee Oswald as the visitor to the Cuban Embassy. After h er release, the CIA ordered her jailed again. These circumstanc es were not known to the Commission. Moreover, in 1978 Duran to ld author Anthony Summers that the man who came to the embass y was blond and about her own height (five feet three)—ha rdly Oswald. (Jim Garrison, On the Trail of the Assassins , pp. 73 - 74) 38 Fourteenth point: Garrison revealed that Oswald was set up as a scapegoat. Garrison introduced a new term to the American public: \"shee pdipping.\" Sheepdipping is an intelligence term for manipulating someone into doi ng things to create a desired image that can be used later to implicate them in a crime. He described it as follows: It had always puzzled me why Oswald had left Dallas in April 1963 to spend the summer in New Orleans, only to re turn to Dallas again in October. But given what I had learn ed, this began to make sense. Clearly, if Oswald was being set up as a communist scapegoat, his close association in Dalla s with the anti-communist White Russians had to be severed. Li kewise, a summer of ostentatiously handing out pro-Castro lea flets in New Orleans reinforced the image of a crazed communist assassin. In the intelligence community, there is a term for thi s kind of manipulated behavior designed to create a desired i mage: sheepdipping. It seemed to me that Oswald had been in New Orleans to be sheepdipped under the guidance of Guy Banister and that he had been sent back to Dallas when the m ission was accomplished. (Jim Garrison, On the Trail of the Assassins , pp. 70 - 71) A final point—not addressed by Garrison but needs t o be refuted—is the Warren Commission’s assertion that Oswald had attempted to kill Major General Edwin A. Walker on April 6, 1963 using the same Mannlicher-C arcano rifle that the government claimed was used to kill Kennedy. 39 The Commission made a feeble attempt to link the bullet found in Walker’s house to the Mannlicher-Carcano, but eventually this was discredited. At one point, the Warren Report referred to the testimony of FBI ballistics expert Robert A. Frazie r. The following is an excerpt from the Warren Report regarding Frazier’s attempt to li nk the Kennedy murder weapon to the Walker shooting incident:"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 121 Frazier testified, however, that he found no micros copic characteristics or other evidence which would indic ate that the bullet was not fired from the Mannlicher-Carcano ri fle owned by Lee Harvey Oswald. 40 In crimes where a gun is fired, law enforcement inv estigators normally look for evidence linking the bullet found at the crime scen e to a weapon owned by the suspect. When the FBI investigated the Walker shooting, they were apparently satisfied to make their allegation first—that the bullet came fr om Oswald’s weapon—then conclude that the allegation was correct because no evidence was found to refute it. This rationale—which was stated in the Warren Repor t—is so ridiculous that it deserves no further comment. In addition, the government’s allegation that Oswal d shot at Walker’s house with a Mannlicher-Carcano rifle—allegedly, the same murder weapon that killed Kennedy— was further weakened by critics, such as Garrison a nd others, who demonstrated that the Mannlicher-Carcano was not the murder weapon us ed in the assassination. One of the incriminating pieces of evidence which i mplicated Oswald in the Walker shooting incident were three photographs of the Gen eral’s home found in Oswald’s belongings at the home of Ruth Paine (the Irving-ba sed woman with a strong intelligence background, introduced to the Oswalds through George and Jeanne De Mohrenschildt, who allowed Marina Oswald to live wi th her and her husband Michael while the Oswalds were separated). One of the photo graphs was of a 1957 Chevrolet—reportedly owned by General Walker and pa rked in the General’s driveway. There was a hole punched in the photograp h that prevented the license plate of the Chevrolet from being read. Dallas police and the FBI concluded that Oswald had punched the hole in the photograph in order to prevent anyone from linking the General’s automobile to him. This evidence has sinc e been discredited. 41 Furthermore, much of the evidence implicating Lee O swald in the Kennedy assassination, the Walker shooting, and even an all eged attempt on Richard Nixon’s life 42 came from the testimony of Oswald’s widow, Marina. Although Marina Oswald has recanted her statements against her husband, it should be noted that any testimony against him would not have been admissible in a tri al had he lived. This point alone shows the injustice of the Warren Commission. Havin g stated that, we should also remember that Marina first told the authorities tha t Lee was innocent. It was only after she had been held for weeks by the federal authorit ies that her story began to change. But she spoke little English at the time and was co mpletely intimidated by the federal investigators. Since then she has acquired a better command of the language and began publicly defending her deceased husband. In a 1988 interview published in Ladies’ Home Journal , Marina made the following statements: When I was questioned by the Warren Commission, I w as a blind kitten. Their questioning left me only one way to g o: guilty. I made Lee guilty. He never had a fair chance... But I was o nly 22 then, and I’ve matured since; I think differently. 43 "},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 122 Researcher Jim Marrs wrote in his 1989 book, Crossfire , that Marina reversed her 1963-64 statements against her husband, plus she pr ovided additional information. Marina’s assertions and views are as follows (per J im Marrs): \u0001 The federal authorities forced her Warren Commissio n testimony by threatening her with deportation. They also ordered her not to read or listen to anything pertaining to the assassination. \u0001 Marina believes there was a conspiracy to kill Kenn edy. \u0001 Marina stated that Lee Harvey Oswald was an agent w ho \"worked for the American government\" and was \"caught between two po wers—the government and organized crime.\" \u0001 Marina believes her husband was \"killed to keep his mouth shut.\" \u0001 Marina stated that someone impersonated her husband to incriminate him and \"that’s no joke.\" \u0001 Lee Harvey Oswald \"adored\" President Kennedy. 44 These and other facts have indeed changed public op inion about Lee Harvey Oswald in recent years. There can be no doubt—as Garrison correctly stated— that he was totally, unequivocally, and completely innocent of the assassination of President Kennedy. Jack Ruby’s Filmed Interview An interesting fact pointing to Israeli involvement in President Kennedy’s assassination is a filmed statement by Jack Ruby, t he man who shot and killed accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald. Ruby was Jewish . His real name was Rubenstein. In March 1964, Jack Ruby was found guilty of murder ing Lee Harvey Oswald and was sentenced to death. After the verdict and sente nce, Ruby requested several times to be moved to Washington, DC to testify before the Warren Commission. Each request was denied. Although most of the Commission ’s work was done in secret, they did visit Dallas on one occasion where they in terviewed Ruby. He made the following statement: Ruby: Everything pertaining to what’s happening has never come to the surface. The world will never know the true facts o f what occurred – my motives. The people had so much to gain, and h ad such an ulterior motive to put me in the position I’m in, w ill never let the true facts come above board to the world. Questioner: Are these people in very high positions Jack?"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 123 Ruby: Yes. ( The Men Who Killed Kennedy – The Coup D’etat , N. Turner) Less than three years later, in January 1967, Jack Ruby died in prison of lung cancer. He told his family he had been injected with cancer cells. 45 In 1979 the House Select Committee on Assassination s linked Ruby to Jewish Mafia chief, Meyer Lanksy (aka, Maier Suchowljansky). Kee p in mind that both men were Jewish. The Encyclopedia Britannica states the foll owing about Lanksy and Ruby: [Meyer Lanksy was] one of the most powerful and ric hest of U.S. crime syndicate chiefs and bankers, who had major i nterests in gambling, especially in Florida, pre-Castro Cuba, L as Vegas, and the Bahamas. ... In 1979 the House of Representatives Assassinatio ns Committee, ending its two-year investigation of the Warren Commission report, linked Lansky with Jack Ruby, th e nightclub owner who killed presidential assassin Lee Harvey O swald. (Encyclopedia Britannica - Meyer Lansky) Julia Ann Mercer Saw Ruby Drop off a Gunman at Deal y Plaza Jack Ruby had worked for the Mafia for years. He li kely worked for Meyer Lansky’s top lieutenant, Santo Trafficante who handled mob b usiness in Florida and Cuba. ( Footnote 17 ) Ruby participated in the assassination by performi ng ad hoc assignments for the hitmen and their handlers. After Oswald was arrested, the conspirators obvious ly decided he needed to be eliminated. They likely made Ruby an offer he could n’t refuse. \"Either kill Oswald,\" they must have said, \"or we’l l implicate you in the murder of President Kennedy instead of Oswald. We have a resp ectable witness who saw you drop off a man with a rifle near Dealy Plaza shortl y before Kennedy was killed.\" Julia Ann Mercer identified Jack Ruby as a man driv ing a pick-up truck who dropped off another man carrying a rifle near Dealy Plaza s hortly before the assassination. The following is a description of Mercer’s story from J im Garrison’s book, On the Trail of the Assassins : Some of the best witnesses to the assassination fou nd their way"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" 124 to us after it became apparent to them that the fed eral agents and the Dallas police really were not interested in what they saw. Julia Ann Mercer was just such a witness. In fact, no other witness so completely illuminated for me the extent of the cover- up. Mercer had been but a few feet away when one of the riflemen was unloaded at the grassy knoll shortly before the arrival of the presidential motorcade. Consequently, she was a wit ness not only to the preparation of President Kennedy's murd er but also to the conspiracy involved. She gave statements to the FBI and the Dallas Sheri ff's office, and then returned to the FBI and provided additiona l statements, but she was never called by the Warren Commission—n ot even to provide an affidavit. Much earlier, I had read Julia Ann Mercer's stateme nts in the Warren Commission exhibits, but I had never had a c hance to talk to her. Then one day in early 1968 her husband called me at the office. He said that he and his wife were in Ne w Orleans on business and had some things to tell me. I agreed t o meet them at the Fairmont Hotel, where they were staying. Arriving at their suite, I found a most impressive couple. A middle-aged man of obvious substance, he had been a Republican member of Congress from Illinois. Equall y impressive, she was intelligent and well-dressed, t he kind of witness any lawyer would love to have testifying on his side in front of a jury. After he had departed on business, I handed her copies of her statements as they had been printed i n the Warren Commission exhibits. She read them carefully and th en shook her head. \"These all have been altered,\" she said. \"They have me saying just the opposite of what I really told them.\" About an hour before the assassination she had been driving west on Elm Street and had been stopped—just past t he grassy knoll—by traffic congestion. To her surprise (becau se she recalled that the President's parade was coming soo n), she saw a young man in the pickup truck to her right dismou nt, carrying a rifle, not too well concealed in a covering of some sort. She then observed him walk up \"the grassy hill which forms p art of the overpass.\" She looked at the driver several times, got a good look at his round face and brown eyes, and he looke d right back at her. Mercer also observed that three police officers wer e standing"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" 125 near a motorcycle on the overpass bridge above her and just ahead. She recalled that they showed no curiosity a bout the young man climbing the side of the grassy knoll wit h the rifle. After the assassination, when Mercer sought to make this information available to law enforcement authoritie s, their response was almost frenzied. At the FBI office—whe re she went the day after the assassination—she was shown a num ber of mug shots. Among the several she selected as resemb ling the driver was a photograph of Jack Ruby. On Sunday, wh en she saw Ruby kill Oswald on television, she positively recognized him as the driver of the pickup truck and promptly noti fied the local Bureau office. Nevertheless, the FBI altered her st atement so it did not note that she had made a positive identific ation. She laughed when she pointed this out to me. \"See,\" she said, \"the FBI made it just the opposite of what I really told them.\" Then she added, \"He was only a few feet away from me. Ho w could I not recognize Jack Ruby when I saw him shoot Oswald on television?\" The Dallas Sheriff’s office went through the same l aborious fraud and added an imaginative touch of its own. Although Mercer had never been brought before any notary, the Sheriff's office filed a sworn affidavit stating that she did not identify t he driver, although she might, \"if I see him again,\" and significantly changing other facts. \"See that notarized signature?\" she asked me. \"That 's not my signature either. I sign my name with a big ‘A’ lik e this.\" She produced a pen and wrote her name for me. It was cl ear that the signature the Dallas Sheriff’s office had on its al tered statement was not even close to hers. Julia Ann Mercer then wrote on the side of my copie s of the FBI and the Dallas Sheriff fabrications the correct ver sion of what she had seen then. That version had not been acceptable in Dallas, but it was more than welcome to me. Conscious of th e sudden deaths of some witnesses who appeared to have seen too much for their own survival, I thought that she should s ign her maiden name as she had back in Dallas right after the assa ssination. At my suggestion she did so. When I got back to my office, I thought about Julia Ann Mercer. She had been only a few feet away from one of the m ost crucial incidents of the assassination and had tried in vai n to tell the federal and Dallas law enforcement authorities the simple truth. The implications of her experience were profound. F irst of all, Mercer's observations provided further evidence tha t there was"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" 126 another rifleman on the knoll ahead of the Presiden t. But to me the responses to her statements were even more chilling. They proved that law enforcement official s recognized early on that a conspiracy existed to kill the Pres ident. Both local and federal authorities had altered Mercer's statem ents precisely to conceal that fact. I already had concluded that parts of the local Dal las law enforcement establishment were probably implicated in the assassination or its cover-up. But now I saw that t he highly respected FBI was implicated as well. After all, th e Bureau had to have known on Saturday, November 23, when it showed Jack Ruby's photo to Mercer, that Ruby might have been i nvolved in a conspiracy. This was the day before Ruby shot Oswal d. (Jim Garrison, On the Trail of the Assassins , pp. 251 - 254) House Select Committee on Assassinations Ignored Me rcer’s Testimony Garrison made the following comments about the Hous e Select Committee’s deception regarding Julia Ann Mercer’s eye-witness account of Ruby: There was a coda to the Julia Ann Mercer story. In the late 1970s when I was in private law practice, the House Selec t Committee on Assassinations convened. Because I had seen too much critical material disappear in the hands of federal investigators, I was not enthusiastic about sending the committee an ything. However, Mercer's observations, as well as the gove rnment's alteration of them, were of overriding importance. There was no evidence more conclusive of the frontal shooting of Kennedy, of the conspiracy and of the subsequent cover-up. Cons equently, I sent the committee copies of Mercer's statements to the FBI and the Dallas Sheriff's office as they appeared in the Warren Commission exhibits, with her description of the al terations written on the sides of each. Because of the exceptionally high casualty rate amo ng important assassination witnesses, I described her only by he r maiden name, which she had signed on her statements. In an accompanying letter, I explained the reason to the committee and said that if they intended to call her as a witness and would assure me that there would be a serious effort to p rotect bar, I"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 127 would be happy to send her married name and present address. I never received a reply from the House Committee. Some years later I happened to be thumbing through the publish ed hearings of the committee when I stumbled on an interesting passage.

The House Committee's investi gators, the report continued, \"had been unable to locate her.\" (Jim Garrison, On the Trail of the Assassins , pp. 254 - 255) Ruby’s Association With the FBI Garrison provided additional information about Ruby ’s association with the FBI in the 1950s: Jack Ruby had a special relationship with the Dalla s office of the FBI In 1959. Ruby met at least nine times with one of the Dallas Bureau's agents. At that time he also purchased a m icrophone- equipped wrist watch, a bugged tie clip, a telephon e bug, and a bugged attaché case. These facts suggested that Jac k Ruby was probably a regular informant with the local Bureau office. But Ruby may well have been working for the CIA als o. Individuals on the payroll of one agency are someti mes hired as contract employees for another agency within the in telligence community. During 1959, the same year in which Ruby was meeting with the FBI agent, he took two flights to Cuba. One was for eight days. The other was an overnight turn-aro und flight. Earlier in the 1950s he had consulted a war supplie s dealer about the purchase of 100 jeeps, one of the most valuable items for the rebels in Cuba whom the CIA was supporting at that time. On a later occasion, he was deeply involved in gun runni ng for the Cuban rebels supported by the Agency. (Jim Garrison, On the Trail of the Assassins , p. 254) Ruby Tried to Save Oswald After Oswald’s arrest, Ruby apparently tried to sav e Oswald by phoning the Dallas Police Department and warning them not to move Oswa ld through the basement.

At around 9:00 pm, he received an anonymous but urgent call from someone who turned out to be R uby. In an interview years later, Bremer described the phone call. I thought I recognized the voice, but at the time I could not put a face or a name with the voice. And as we talked, he began telling me that we needed to change the plans on moving Osw ald from the basement – that he knew of the plans to make th e move, and if we did not make a change – the statement he made precisely was \"We are going to kill him.\" Bremer reported the call, then went home and went t o sleep when his shift was over that night. The next morning, he saw on television that Ruby had shot Oswald. No sooner then I had turned it on, they were tellin g that Jack Ruby had killed Oswald. Then I suddenly realized, k nowing Jack Ruby the way I did, this was the man I was talking to on the phone last night. At that time, I put the voice wit h the face. And I knew within myself that Jack Ruby was the one that made that call to me the night before. And I think it was obv ious because he knew me, and I knew him, and he called me by my nam e over the telephone. And seeing this, and knowing what I knew and what he had said, then to me, it had to be Jack Rub y. ( The Men Who Killed Kennedy – The Coup D’etat , N. Turner) General Charles Cabell and Brother Earle, Mayor of Dallas General Charles Cabell was a key figure in the assa ssination. His brother, Earle Cabell, was mayor of Dallas when Kennedy was killed . This fact was uncovered by Jim Garrison. The Cabell brothers were likely enlis ted in the Israeli-born coup during or shortly after the Cuban Missile Crisis. General Charles Cabell had been fired by President Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961. A key contribution to the coup—apparently made by t he aforementioned Cabell brothers—was to change the motorcade route on the d ay of the assassination. The motorcade was apparently changed in order to pass b y the Texas School Book Depository, thereby implicating Oswald as the assas sin because he worked there. The following is Garrison’s description—from his book, On the Trail of the Assassins —of how he discovered the Cabell brothers: One morning I was in my office reading and rereadin g a newspaper. I did not hear Frank [Klein] enter."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" 129 \"I have never seen you so preoccupied,\" said Frank. \"It's not just any paper, son,\" I said. \"This is th e front page of the Dallas Morning News for November 22, 1963.\" \"Well, what's got you so hypnotized?\" I gestured to the large diagram on the paper's fron t page, indicating the route of the presidential parade. \"H ave I ever shown you this before?\" I asked. He shook his head. I turned the paper around facing his way so that he could read the diagram of the motorcade. It covered almost fiv e-sixths of the front page. \"Frank,\" I said, \"I want you to follow the parade r oute with me. Let's pick it up right here as it comes down Main a pproaching Dealey Plaza. Are you with me?\" \"Yes,\" he said, his finger following the thick line indicating the motorcade. \"And here is where it reaches Dealey Pla za. . .\" He stopped. \"What's the matter?\" I asked. \"This diagram indicates that the President's parade was supposed to continue on Main Street through the cen ter of Dealey Plaza-without even leaving Main.\" He stared at it in disbelief. \"So what's wrong with that?\" I asked. His finger was moving off of Main, inches downward to Elm until he found the Depository area where the President ha d been shot. \"if that was the presidential parade route up there on Main . . .\" I finished the question for him. \"How did he get wa y down here on Elm?\" Frank looked up at me with a slight frown, then loo ked back at the diagram. He moved his finger back along Main St reet to where it reached Houston. \"The motorcade turned rig ht on Houston and went down onto Elm,\" he said. \"Where the motorcade made that sweeping 120-degree left turn you are looking at, which had to slow the President 's car down to"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 130 about ten miles an hour.\" Frank looked up again at the thick line indicating the motorcade route continuing on Main through the center of Deal ey Plaza as it headed for the Stemmons Freeway. \"Here on Main street, continuing through the open m eadow,\" he said, \"they couldn't have hit him. Are you telling me that at the last moment they just moved the President of the Un ited States off of his scheduled route to here where the Deposi tory is?\" He pushed back his chair and stood up. \"Hell, I haven' t read a damned word about that anywhere. How can they keep something like that a secret for three years?\" I leaned back in my chair. \"Now you see why I didn' t hear you knock when you came in.\" \"Where the hell were the Dallas police when they ma de that last- minute change in the route?\" he asked. \"Where indeed?\" I asked. \"And the Secret Service. A nd the FBI\" \"And the city administration of Dallas,\" he added. \"Don't they have a mayor over there in that damned place?\" \"Yes, they do. The mayor when this happened was Ear le Cabell.\" I buzzed the intercom and my secretary, Sharon Herk es, came in. I asked her to take a cab to the public library and find the latest volume of Who's Who in the Southwest. \"I'm s ure you'll find Earle Cabell in there. See if his article indicates any connections with Washington.\" \"With Washington?\" Frank asked. \"Of course,\" I replied. \"You can't tell me it's pos sible to hijack the President—with the whole world watching—unless ther e's some kind of cooperation between the city administration and the federal government.\" Frank grabbed the front page of the Dallas Morning News and pointed to the diagram. \"Hell,\" he said, \"was the W arren Commission blind? Didn't they see this?\" \"Oh,\" I said. \"Would you like to see the front page that was introduced to the Warren Commission?\" I pulled open my middle desk drawer and took out a copy of the Dallas Morning News front page that had been introd uced as a"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" 131 Commission exhibit. I handed it to Frank and lit my pipe. I had hardly taken the first puff on it when he yelled. \"Those bastards! They just removed the entire motor cade route from the front page.\" That was true. On five-sixths of the Dallas Morning News page where the diagram of the motorcade route was suppos ed to be was nothing but a large square of solid gray. \"And this has been printed as an official, exhibit by the Warren Commi ssion?\" he asked. I nodded. \"And just what in the hell are we supposed to call this?\" he asked, waving the nearly blank exhibit. I took a puff or two on my pipe. \"This is what you call,\" I replied, \"a coup d'etat.\" An hour or so later Sharon walked in the door with a large photostat in her hand. \"They, didn't have anything about Mayor Cabell in the Who's Who,\" she said. \"But there's a lot of stuff here about a General Charles Cabell.\" I glanced down at the article. Right away it jumped out at me from the page that this Charles Cabell had been the depu ty director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Now I found myself looking at that last name with real fascination. It took one p hone call to an attorney friend in Dallas to determine that General Charles Cabell was the brother of Earle Cabell, former mayor of Da llas. Now the eleventh-hour change in the President's mot orcade route was even more intriguing to me, and I immedia tely headed for the public library. Before sunset I had become the leading expert in New Orleans on General Charles Cabell, wh o, it turned out, had been fired as the CIA's number two man by President Kennedy. General Cabell had been in charge of the A gency's disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion. In the final hours , while Castro's small air force was tearing the landing effort apar t, Cabell had managed to get through a call to President Kennedy in an attempt to halt the disaster. Just over the horizon , by something less than happenstance, lay aircraft carriers with fighter planes on their decks, engines warming up. General Cabell informed the President that these fighters could reverse the cou rse of disaster in minutes and secure the success of the invasion. All that was needed was the President's authorization. On the preceding day Kennedy had assured the assemb led"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 132 media that if anyone invaded Cuba (and the air had become rife with invasion rumors) there certainly would be no h elp from the US armed forces. He flatly turned Cabell down. With that the invasion's chances sank, as did the general's intel ligence career. President Kennedy asked for Cabell's resignation an d the general was subsequently replaced on February 1, 1962, as t he CIA's deputy director. General Cabell's subsequent hatred of John Kennedy became an open secret in Washington. In most countries, a powerful individual who had be en in open conflict with a national leader who was later assas sinated would receive at least a modicum of attention in the cour se of the posthumous inquiry. A major espionage organization with a highly sophisticated capability for accomplishing m urder might receive even more. Certainly a powerful individual who also held a top position in a major espionage apparatus and h ad been at odds with the departed leader would be high on the list of suspects. However, General Cabell, who fit that description p erfectly, was never even called as a witness before the Warren Co mmission. One reason may have been that Allen Dulles, the for mer CIA director (also fired by President Kennedy), was a m ember of the Commission and handled all leads relating to the Ag ency. During the nine years that Dulles had been the CIA's chief , General Charles Cabell had been his deputy. (Jim Garrison, On the Trail of the Assassins , pp. 117 - 121) Former CIA Director, Allen Dulles Allen Dulles was CIA director during the Eisenhower administration, and Kennedy allowed him to continue serving in that capacity un til after the Bay of Pigs invasion, after which Kennedy asked Dulles to resign. Accordi ng to historian Michael Beschloss, the Kennedy administration \"stripped\" Du lles of \"certain of his CIA retirement privileges\" in the spring of 1962, about six months before the Cuban Missile Crisis. The following is an excerpt from The Crisis Years by Michael Beschloss: In March 1962, Nixon's memoir Six Crises , charging that Kennedy had subordinated national security to polit ical ambition, caused a public sensation. Nixon wrote that Dulles had told the Democratic nominee that for months the CIA had \"not only been supporting and assisting, but actually training Cub an exiles for the eventual purpose of supporting an invasion of C uba itself.\""},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 133 . . . The President also asked Dulles to issue a st atement saying \"that the President never knew about it.\" But Dulle s told reporters only that Nixon must be victim of an \"honest misund erstanding.\" Soon thereafter, he was stripped of certain of his CIA retirement privileges. (Michael Beschloss, The Crisis Years , p. 29) Beschloss also wrote that Dulles began studying Pre sident Kennedy’s psychological profile while Kennedy was still President-Elect. Before meeting [with the newly elected President Ke nnedy, CIA director Allen] Dulles evidently studied an assessm ent of Kennedy’s personality by CIA psychologists using fi les dating to the 1930s, including material from British surveill ance of Joseph Kennedy’s London Embassy as well as his son’s warti me service in the Navy. Such assessments predicted how the sub ject would respond when informed of the full range of CIA oper ations, showing Dulles the most effective method of appeal. (Michael Beschloss, The Crisis Years , pp. 102-103) Garrison made the following observations of the CIA ’s study of President-Elect Kennedy: I do not know precisely when the planning and prepa ration for the coup began. In a sense, it may have been as early a s late 1960 when the CIA prepared a dossier analysis on the Pre sident-elect. Such a psychological profile surely would not have contemplated assassination of the President, but its purpose was to help the CIA, or some elements within it, further its goal o f manipulating policy.

According to David, ther e were \"three guns, four shots, three hits, and one miss.\" Two shots hit Kennedy, o ne hit Connally, and one missed the car completely. Furthermore, two shots were fir ed simultaneously which explains why witnesses heard three shots. After studying the Zapruder film, I have concluded that David’s version is absolutely correct. Not only is it correct, I realized that th e Zapruder film alone proves in a legal sense that there was a conspiracy. All one has to d o is look at the Zapruder film. I highly recommend that anyone interested in the Ke nnedy assassination go to the nearest video store and rent the Zapruder film. Bef ore viewing it, purge your mind of any pre-conceived notions. Forget what the so-calle d experts have told you and look at it with an open mind. You will see—as I did—two important things rarely discussed by the so-called assassination experts. F irst of all, it is quite obvious that Kennedy’s neck wound was caused by a different bull et than Connally’s wounds because there was a four second delay between the t ime Kennedy grabbed his neck and the time Connally reacted to being hit. The War ren Commission concluded that one bullet hit Kennedy in the neck and caused all o f Connally’s wounds. This is known as the \"Single Bullet Theory.\" Simply stated, the Warren Commission’s Single Bullet Theory is impossible. Secondly, the Zapruder film shows that there must h ave been at least two gunmen because there was only a one-second delay between t he time Connally reacted to being hit in the back and the time Kennedy was shot in the head. That simply was not enough time for one gunman to fire two shots. The W arren Report stated that a minimum of \"2.3 seconds\" is \"necessary to operate t he [Mannlicher-Carcano] rifle\" to fire two consecutive shots. 1 Using the government’s own logic, there had to hav e been two gunmen because Kennedy was hit in the head less than 2.3 seconds after Connally was hit. According to the government, this would be impossible for one gunman. Using this logic, the shot that caused Kenn edy’s head wound could have come from the front or the back, but two gunmen wou ld still have been required because of the one second delay between Connally’s shot in the back and Kennedy’s shot in the head. The one-second delay between the second and third s hots was corroborated by the eye-witness account of Mary Woodward, a junior repo rter on the Dallas Morning News at the time of the assassination. In fact she wrote an article describing the assassination before it was even announced that Ken nedy had died. The following is Woodward’s description— from an interview years lat er for The Men Who Killed Kennedy —of the shots she observed: ...One thing I am totally positive of in my own mind is how many shots there were. And there were three shots. The s econd two"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 137 shots were immediate. It was almost as if one were an echo of the other, they came so quickly. The sound of one d id not cease until the second shot. ... ( The Men Who Killed Kennedy: The Cover-up , N. Turner) We have an eye-witness account and a film of the as sassination; both clearly indicate that the second and third shots were immediate. As Mary Woodward stated, \"It was almost as if one were an echo of the other.\" Again, the Warren Report stated that a minimum of 2.3 seconds delay is required between tw o consecutive shots from the alleged murder weapon, a Mannlicher-Carcano. Keep in mind that Woodward’s observation that she h eard three shots does not refute Christian David’s claim that there were actually fo ur shots fired. David also stated that two shots were fired almost simultaneously. He nce, witnesses heard only three shots. These facts are not complicated. They do not requir e an expert’s analysis. Any reasonable person of average intelligence can under stand them. Yet the sponsors of Kennedy’s murder have trained the public to rely on expert \"interpretation\" of these simple facts. After viewing the Zapruder film for y ourself, it will become clear that most of the so-called assassination researchers hav e confused the public for years on the notion of conspiracy. The sponsors of Kennedy’s murder have created a general state of public confusion by expressing from all si des so many complex opinions that the public has decided to have no opinion of any ki nd in matters of conspiracy. John Connally’s Wounds The nature of John Connally’s wounds are another to pic of debate among the so- called critics of the Warren Report. The facts I am about to present will show that John Connally generally told the truth about his wo unds. It will also become obvious that one bullet struck Connally wounding him in fiv e places. In addition, the individual who shot Connally was standing in the vi cinity of the upper floors of the Texas School Book Depository. This does not refute the previously described proof of conspiracy. Remember, the Warren Commission conclud ed that one bullet hit Kennedy in the neck and also wounded Connally in fi ve places. My position is that one bullet hit Kennedy in the neck, and a separate bullet hit Connally. A third bullet hit Kennedy in the right temple and killed him. Als o, the fact that the individual who shot Connally fired from the vicinity of the upper floors of the Texas School Book Depository does not prove that Oswald was the shoot er. Here are the facts. The position in which Connally was sitting when he was struck is critical to understanding the direction the bullet was travelin g. I have also discovered that Connally’s physical position at the moment he was h it is an area in which disinformation abounds. The nature of Connally’s wo unds is equally important. The combination of these two things—the physical positi on he was in when he was hit and"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":" 138 the nature of his wounds—makes it fairly easy to as certain the general location from which the shot was fired. I have seen at least one hand-drawn diagram, in a p opular assassination book, where Connally is sitting in the wrong position when he w as hit. In that diagram, Connally is facing forward, but if you view the Zapruder film, you will see that Connally was actually sitting sideways, facing to his right when he was hit. His torso was twisted to the right because he turned to look behind after he aring gunfire from the back. His legs may have pointed forward, but his torso was de finitely twisted to the right. This is a critical point. All of Connally’s wounds were to the left and below the previous wound, but this only makes sense if you understand that his torso w as twisted to the right and his legs were facing forward. More specifically, a bullet en tered Connally’s back at his right armpit, continued in a straight line exiting the ri ght side of his chest (at the right nipple), entering and exiting his right wrist, and hitting his left thigh. 2 The bullet was obviously traveling downward and to the left in a s traight line. This means that the individual who shot Connally had fired from a high position, from behind the Presidential limousine, and to the right of it (fro m the riders’ perspective). In other words, the individual who shot Connally had fired f rom the vicinity of the upper floors of the Texas School Book Depository. Transcript of Connally’s Interview From The Men Who Killed Kennedy The facts I have just described match Connally’s te stimony which states that he turned to look over his right shoulder immediately after hearing the first shot. As he began to turn back around, he was hit. He was not f acing forward, as so many of the \"false critics\" would have us believe. The followin g is Connally’s description of the shots from The Men Who Killed Kennedy : Nellie [Connally’s wife] turned to the President an d said, \"Mr. President, you can’t say now that they don’t love y ou here in Dallas. Within a matter of a few seconds after that, we tur ned on Elm Street to go down to get on the Stemmons Freeway to go out to the Trade Mart where the luncheon was being held. T hat’s when the shots occurred. I heard what I thought was a rifle shot. I immediat ely reacted by turning to look over my right shoulder because that ’s where the sound came from. I didn’t see anything out of the ordinary and was i n the process of turning to look over my left shoulder when I felt a blow in the middle of my back as if someone had hit me with a d oubled up"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" 139 fist, about like that. [As he was speaking, he hit his hands together hard , three times, one hand balled in a fist hitting the open palm of the other.] The blow was of such force that it bent me over [le aning forward to indicate it bent him over in the forward directi on] and I immediately saw that I was covered with blood – and I knew I’d been hit. And I said, \"Oh my God, they’re gonna kil l us all!\" And I heard another shot that was a loud shot almos t like that [a gunshot noise is heard as a picture of the Zapruder film shows Kennedy being shot fatally in the head], and immedi ately I saw blood and brain tissue all over the back of the lim ousine. I knew then that the President had been fatally hit becaus e Mrs. Kennedy, then, I heard her say, \"My God. I’ve got h is brains in my hand.\" (John Connally, The Men Who Killed Kennedy – The Coup d'état , N. Turner) Connally’s description of the assassination was con sistent with Zapruder film with one exception. I do not believe he said, \"Oh my God , they’re gonna kill us all.\" The reason I don’t believe it is because he only had on e second to get those eight words out before the next shot was fired. There simply wa s not enough time. Again, look at the Zapruder film. Connally claimed he uttered thos e words after the second shot hit him in the back. After making the alleged statement he said he heard a third shot, the one that hit Kennedy in the head and killed him. Th e Zapruder film reveals a one- second delay between those two shots. I don’t belie ve those eight words—or any eight words—can be uttered in just one second. Try it. For anyone who might argue that the Zapruder film i s tainted in some way, recall the eye-witness account of Mary Woodward who made the f ollowing observation of the second and third shots: \"...there were three shots. T he second two shots were immediate. It was almost as if one were an echo of the other, they came so quickly. The sound of one did not cease until the second sho t.\" We have film footage and an eye-witness account. Bo th clearly refute Connally’s claim that he shouted \"Oh my God, they’re gonna kil l us all!\" after being hit. Connally may have been coached into telling that wh ite lie, or maybe he made the statement in his mind—thought it, but didn’t actual ly say it. In either case, critics had a field day analyzing his alleged remark. It fed th e ridiculous notion that he was part of the conspiracy because by stating \"they’re gonna kill us all,\" he must have known that there were multiple shooters. I use the word \" ridiculous\" because I do not believe he, or any rational person, would have put themselv es in harm’s way to help kill someone. But I could definitely believe he was enco uraged to lie about this subtle point for two reasons. First of all, it wasn’t the kind of lie that he could easily be convicted of perjury for telling. Secondly, it crea ted a smokescreen by encouraging nonsensical debates amongst critics."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" 140 Summary of Shots Fired Here is my analysis of the shots fired: 1. Four shots were fired. 2. Only three shots hit Kennedy and Connally. 3. One shot missed the car completely, ricocheted off the curb far ahead of the car and a fragment grazed bystander, James Teague, in the cheek. 3 4. The first shot was fired from the rear, hitting Ken nedy in the neck. We know Kennedy was probably hit in the neck because he was seen clutching his throat in the Zapruder film. Furthermore, we know the shot was likely fired from behind because Connally reacted immediately by turn ing around. \"I immediately reacted,\" Connally stated, \"by turning to look over my right shoulder because that’s where the sound came from.\" His filmed reaction and his testimony are consistent with Kennedy’s neck/ba ck wound being caused by someone firing from the rear. 5. Four seconds after Kennedy was hit in the neck, a s econd bullet hit Connally in the back causing five wounds (right back, right chest, entry and exit wounds on right wrist, and one wound on left thigh). The b ullet that hit Connally was obviously fired from the direction of the Texas Sch ool Book Depository because each of Connally’s wounds was downward and to the left from the previous one. 6. One second after Connally was hit, a third shot was fired fatally hitting Kennedy in the head. The timing alone proves there was a second gunman because, according to the Warren Report, 2.3 second s are required to fire two consecutive shots from a Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, the type of weapon Oswald was alleged by the government to have used. If there was a second gunman, then by definition there was a conspiracy. 7. The chronology in which the \"missed\" shot was fired cannot be determined; however, Christian David stated that it was the fou rth of four shots fired, that it was fired from the rear, and that two shots were fired almost simultaneously (reference Chapter 5 ). Given that the Zapruder film clearly shows Kenne dy and Connally reacting to three separate shots, and given that most eye witnesses claim to have heard only three shots, we can conclude that the shot which missed the limousine was fired simultaneously with one of the other three shots that hit Kennedy and Connally and that it was fired from the rear. The sequence in which it was fired is a moot point because conspiracy has already been proved by Point No. 6. Kennedy’s Neck/Back Wound Much has been made about the direction of the shot to Kennedy’s neck. As previously stated, we know that Connally’s immediate reaction after hearing the first shot—the one that caused Kennedy to grab his neck—was to loo k to the rear. My description of Connally’s response is corroborated in the Zapruder film and in Connally’s testimony."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 141 Hence, we can conclude that the wound to Kennedy’s neck/back was caused by someone firing from the rear. In my opinion, many of the so-called critics who ma ke a fuss about the direction of the bullet that hit Kennedy in the neck are intenti onally creating a smokescreen to divert people away from noticing and discussing tim e delays between shots. Joseph Milteer Corroborated Jewish Conspiracy Joseph Milteer was an individual with first-hand kn owledge of the conspiracy to kill Kennedy. Thirteen days before the assassination, Mi lteer told a Miami police informant that Kennedy would be killed with a high- powered rifle from an office building. After the assassination, he told the same informant that a Jewish conspiracy was behind the assassination. An FBI report was sub sequently filed on the entire incident. Joseph Milteer was a wealthy southerner from Quitma n, 4 Georgia with ultra- conservative extremist political leanings. He was a n active member of the Constitutional America Party and had acquaintances in the Ku Klux Klan. 5 His politics were a mixture of right-wing extremism mix ed with Evangelical Christianity and the belief in Armageddon. Evangelicals believe Jews are needed to establish a Jewish state so that Jesus will return, gather all Jews in Israel, and build a Temple. The world would then end and practically all the Je ws would be killed at Armageddon. The few Jewish survivors would convert to Christian ity. 6 On November 9, 1963, a Miami police informant named William Somersett met with Milteer who outlined the assassination. Somersett w as a union organizer with extensive right-wing political ties. President Kenn edy was scheduled to come to Miami on November 18, 1963. As a security measure, the local police were monitoring known subversives like Milteer. A tape r ecorder and microphone was placed in Somersett’s apartment where the two men m et. 7 The following is a transcript of the conversation b etween Milteer and Somersett on November 9, 1963 nearly two weeks before Kennedy wa s killed: Somersett: I think Kennedy is coming here on the 18th, or some thing like that to make some kind of speech . . . Milteer: You can bet your bottom dollar he is going to have a lot to say about the Cubans. There are so many of them here. Somersett:"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" 142 Yeah. Well, he will have a thousand bodyguards, don 't worry about that. Milteer: The more bodyguards he has the easier it is to get him. Somersett: Well, how in the hell do you figure would be the be st way to get him? Milteer: From an office building with a high-powered rifle. Somersett: Do you think he knows he’s a marked man? Milteer: I’m sure he does. I’m sure he does. Yes. Somersett: They are really going to try to kill him? Milteer: Oh yeah, it’s in the working. Somersett: Hitting this Kennedy I’ll tell you is going to be a hard proposition, I believe. Now you may have it figured out to get him from an office building and all that, but I don’t know how the Sec ret Service— they’d ... cover all them office buildings and anywhe re he’s going. Do you know whether they’d do that or not? Milteer: If they have any suspicions, they will of course. B ut without suspicions the chances are they wouldn’t. You would n’t have to take a gun up there. They’d take it up in pieces, a ssemble it and take it out in pieces. All those guns come knocked down and you can take them apart."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" 143 Somersett: Boy, if that Kennedy gets shot, we have to know whe re we are at. Because you know that will be a real shake if they do that. Milteer: They wouldn't leave any stone unturned there, no wa y.

Turner 8 ) Miami Detective Everette Kaye was in charge of the surveillance operation on Milteer. Prompted by Milteer’s prophecy, security was tighte ned when Kennedy visited Miami on November 18 th . The following is Kaye’s recollection of the chang e in security, from The Men Who Killed Kennedy : ... There was no particular city mentioned [by Milt eer] nor was there any particular person mentioned that was to d o the assassination. ... The tape was made on November 9 th , and President John F. Kennedy was due in Miami on the 18 th of November 1963. So the close proximity of the tape being made and his visi t made quite a few changes in his security. They changed the motor cade—I believe that he was helicoptered in rather than hav e a motorcade. Additional men were secured. Everyone was made awar e that there may be a problem. So there was a drastic chan ge in the procedures. He wasn’t as accessible in this city as he might have been in the past. ( The Men Who Killed Kennedy: The Cover-up , N. Turner) FBI Report Stated Assassination was a Jewish Conspi racy After the assassination, Milteer told the same info rmant, William Somersett, that it was a Jewish conspiracy that sponsored Kennedy’s mu rder. In fact, Milteer referred to the person in charge as \"the big Jew.\" According to an FBI report, Milteer told Somersett that Martin Luther King and Attorney Gene ral Kennedy were now unimportant, but the next move would be against \"th e big Jew.\" Milteer described the assassination as \"a Communist conspiracy by Jews to overthrow the United States government.\" 9"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" 144 This information is extremely important because Mil teer was clearly a man with prior knowledge about the assassination. Despite his extr emist politics, Milteer was a person to be taken seriously. His comment about Mar tin Luther King, Robert Kennedy, and \"the big Jew\" tells us three things. F irst, his reference to \"the big Jew\" corroborates my thesis that one Jewish individual—l ikely Louis Bloomfield—ran the coup against Kennedy. Second, it reveals that right -wing extremists broke ranks with the Jewish-led coup immediately after the assassina tion. Apparently, Milteer and his associates had made a pact with Bloomfield to suppo rt the coup but secretly plotted to kill him—Bloomfield—upon completion of the deed. Th ird, it suggests that contingency plans were in place in 1963—by the righ t-wing extremists—to kill Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. Further evidence indicates that Milteer personally declared a right-wing war on the Jews. On November 24, just two days after the assas sination, Milteer reportedly made a speech before the Constitutional American Party i n Columbia, South Carolina. According to an FBI report, he made the following s tatements: ... to all Christians: The Zionist Jews killed Christ 2000 years ago and on November 22, 1963, they killed President Ken nedy. You Jews killed the President. We are going to kill you . 10 The following FBI report, dated November 27, 1963, 11 documented Milteer’s subsequent conversations with Somersett on November 23 th and 24 th . Although the report was written in a cryptic manner, it clearly stated that Milteer believed a Jewish conspiracy was behind the assassination of Presiden t Kennedy. It also indicated that Milteer’s right-wing extremists had declared war on the Jews. Here is the complete text of the FBI report: 11-27-63 - 6 p.m. Howard Trent, FBI HQ, passed the following informat ion to us per suggestion of Orrin Bartlett: On Nov. 10 and 11 information came to the FBI from an informant [William Somersett] concerning J.A. Milte er, active in the Constitutional American Party, which informatio n was furnished early the morning of Nov. 11 to Agent Sco tt Trundle of our Washington Field Office. Plans, he alleged, wer e being made to kill the President at some future date. He thoug ht it might be done from some place near the White House with a hi gh powered rifle. Subsequently, Mr. Trent continued, the Secret Servi ce in Miami contacted the informant [Somersett] and interviewed him and had access to a recording of interview with him. The same informant [Somersett] has just furnished a dditional"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" 145 information which in many instances cannot be verif ied. In this instance he is speaking of Milteer again. S ays he met Milteer in Jacksonville, Florida, November 23, at w hich time Milteer was jubilant over the assassination and sai d \"everything ran true to form -- I guess you thought I was kiddi ng you when I said he would be killed from a window with a high-p owered rifle.\" Source then asked Milteer whether he was guessing w hen he gave the original information about the plan. Milte er replied \"I don't do any guessing.\" Then Milteer allegedly said on the 23rd that he had been in Ft. Worth and Dallas, as well a s other southern cities, but did not indicate the date he v isited these cities. Milteer allegedly had contact with Robert S helton who is a KKK leader but he thought Shelton could not be depe nded upon as he opposes violence. Milteer was quoted as sayin g Martin Luther King and Attorney General Kennedy are now un important, but the next move would be against \"the big Jew.\" M ilteer alleyed [sic] that there is a Communist conspiracy by Jews to overthrow the United States.

The latter has a history of loyalty to Israel because of its belief in Armageddon. Evangelical ministers Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwe ll are both big supporters of Israel. Robertson in particular is a big believer i n Armageddon. The bizarre thing about Evangelicals is they do not hesitate to encou rage Jewish conversion to Christianity; however, they also feel that Jews are needed in order to fulfill the scriptures. When Menachem Begin was cautioned that Evangelical aid was provided to Israel only because they believed that a new Jewish state was needed for the second coming of Jesus, and the conversion of Jews to Christianit y, he reportedly responded: \"I tell you, if the Christian Fundamentalists support us in Congress today, I will support them when the Messiah comes tomorrow.\" 13 As previously stated, Milteer and his right-wing as sociates apparently made a pact with the Jewish forces—namely Louis Bloomfield—who organized the coup against Kennedy. Such an alliance seems highly plausible fo r several reasons. First of all, Evangelical Christians supported Israel for religio us reasons mentioned before. Secondly, Milteer and his right-wing associates wer e racists and surely detested Kennedy for supporting American \"negroes\" in the bu rgeoning civil rights struggle. Thirdly, Milteer and his associates likely gave Lou is Bloomfield a green light to step up heroin smuggling into the United States—as payme nt to the assassins—by Auguste Ricord et al so long as narcotics sales wer e confined to blacks in the inner cities, thereby making them a permanent underclass. Lastly, Milteer and his associates were ardent anti-communists and felt that Kennedy w as getting too friendly with the Soviets. Apparently Milteer and his associates learned that many of the Jews sponsoring the assassination had leftist leanings even stronger th an Kennedy’s. Louis Bloomfield and Sam Bronfman, for example, were active members of t he leftist Israeli labor union, Histadrut . Whatever the motivation, Milteer clearly indicate d—in the cited FBI report—that he was declaring war on the Jews. Such an action against Jews was not surprising in l ight of the origins of the Ku Klux Klan. Originally formed in Nashville, Tennessee in 1867 by Confederate cavalry general Nathan Bedford Forrest, the Klan disappeare d by 1882 because its original objective—the restoration of white supremacy throug hout the South—had largely been achieved during the 1870s. In addition, Forres t had ordered it disbanded in 1869, because of the group's excessive violence. 14 The second wave of Klan activity began when it was reorganized in 1915, not because of strong antiblack sentiment, but because white Pr otestants in small-town America felt threatened by the Bolshevik revolution in Russ ia and by the large-scale immigration of the previous decades that had change d the ethnic character of American society. 15 Milteer’s call to arms against Jews may have intens ified hatred by the Ku Klux Klan against Jews and blacks alike in its opposition to the Civil Rights movement. On June"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 147 21, 1964, three civil rights workers—Michael Schwer ner, Andrew Goodman and James Earl Chaney—were abducted and killed by the K u Klux Klan in Mississippi. Two of those men were Jewish; only one was African- American. Their abduction occurred just seven months after Kennedy’s assassin ation. As soon as the three workers turned up missing, Pre sident Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover launched a massive investigation. The fate o f the three men was uncertain, but their disappearance provided the final impetus need ed for the 1964 Civil Rights Act to pass. The bodies of Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney w ere found five weeks later, buried in a mud dam. Eventually, 19 men, including the county sheriff and a deputy, were convicted of federal conspiracy charges in con nection with the murders. On the surface, Johnson and Hoover seemed courageou s in their fight against right- wing extremists; but more than likely, Johnson, Hoo ver, and the extremists had been partners in treason. Milteer and George Wallace Did Joseph Milteer have enough influence—even withi n his group right-wing extremist—to instigate a war against Jews? As it tu rns out, he may have had assistance from at least one prominent politician, namely Alabama Governor George Wallace who was friendly with right-wing General Cu rtis LeMay, a hawkish adversary of Kennedy’s during the Cuban Missile Cri sis. 16 Their animosity toward one another has been widely documented. The Constitutional American Party—the group that Mi lteer reportedly addressed on November 24, 1963 when he declared war on Jews—late r evolved into The American Independent Party, Wallace’s party when he ran for president in 1968. 17 General LeMay was his running mate. Wallace loathed the Kennedy brothers and Martin Lut her King because they shamed him in June 1963 during a standoff at the Universit y of Alabama where Wallace stood in the doorway to block enrollment of black student s. Under President Kennedy's direction, Bobby Kennedy called out the Alabama Nat ional Guard who forced Wallace to step aside. King was in the middle of th e conflict as well. In fact, he solicited the aid of the Kennedy brothers to deal w ith Wallace. Wallace wanted to be president badly, probably more than Lyndon Johnson. And he would not have a chance until 1985 when the Kennedy dynasty was over (after John, Bobby and Ted had each served two terms). LeMay was one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during t he Kennedy administration. He was an ardent cold warrior, and partly for this rea son his tenure as chief was neither successful nor happy. LeMay found himself at consta nt odds with the management policies of Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and t he \"flexible response\" military strategy of Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman General Maxwell Taylor. 18 "},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 148 Kennedy’s relationship with the military was strain ed, to say the least. 19 He and Lemay displayed mutual contempt for one another. Ke nnedy once remarked after one his many walkouts on the General, \"I don't want tha t man near me again.\" 20 During the Cuban Missile Crisis, LeMay and the othe r generals wanted to attack Cuba after it was learned that the Soviets had been supp lying Cuban leader Fidel Castro with nuclear missiles. Having been ill-advised once before by the Joint Chiefs during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Kennedy was not willing t o make the same mistake twice. He remarked, \"Those sons of bitches with all the fr uit salad just sat there nodding, saying it would work.\" 21 Kennedy feared that a US assault on Cuba would esca late into nuclear war. In fact it is generally accepted among scholars that one of th e reasons that the nuclear stalemate ended peacefully is because both superpowers feared the possibility of a military coup against Kennedy if a settlement was not reached. 22 In his four years as chief, LeMay argued vigorously for new air weapons like the B70 bomber and the Skybolt missile, and against the swi ngwing \"fighter\" plane, the General Dynamics TFX (later named the F111). He los t all these battles. In addition, LeMay had strong feelings regarding American involv ement in Vietnam, arguing against the gradual response advocated by the admin istration. Once again he was ignored. 23 False Critics and Opposing Propagandists A powerful tool in covering up crimes is the use of false critics. Two examples are Dr. Cyril Wecht and Oliver Stone. Both are left-wing, b oth appear interested in the truth, but neither will look in the direction of Israel. B oth have consciously deceived the public. In addition, opposing propagandists are emp loyed to overtly promote the Warren Report. The end result is often a form of pr ofessional wrestling where both sides pretend to be at odds with each other, but in reality, they report to the same employer. Robert Groden On January 2, 2002 assassination researcher and aut hor Robert Groden gave a lecture at a law office, in Severna Park, Maryland, that of fers classes on the Constitution. About midway through his slide presentation, Groden mentioned Joseph Milteer (the right-wing extremist). As Groden was talking, he sh owed the following slide without comment: Milteer was quoted as saying Martin Luther King and Attorney General Kennedy are now unimportant, but the next m ove would be against \"the big Jew.\""},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" 149 Again, Groden did not comment on Milteer’s \"big Jew \" remark. He merely planted a seed of anti-semitism in people’s minds. The way he presented the excerpt, Groden gave the distinct impression that Milteer was calli ng Kennedy a \"big Jew.\" I discussed this with two other people in the audience. Both ag reed that they thought Milteer’s reference to \"the big Jew\" was President Kennedy. W hen I pointed out the Milteer made the statement on November 23, 1963, the day af ter Kennedy had been killed, they both agreed that Groden was obviously deceivin g the audience. Dr. Cyril Wecht Dr. Cyril Wecht is one of the world’s leading patho logists and a so-called critic of the Warren Report. After closely studying Wecht’s state ments in a filmed interview, which appeared in The Men Who Killed Kennedy , I have concluded that Wecht misled the public about the wounds suffered by President K ennedy and Governor John Connally. Wecht gave a convoluted explanation about a \"magic bullet\" zigzagging in mid-air. Yet the world’s leading pathologist neglec ted to mention the four second delay between the time Kennedy reacted to being hit in the neck (he clutched his throat) and the time Connally reacted to being hit in the back, as displayed in the Zapruder film. Wecht made the following statements in Nigel Turner’s documentary: The infamous magic bullet. We have that bullet exit ing from President Kennedy’s neck, moving forward, and leftw ard, and downward. It now stops in mid-air. It turns to the right. It comes back a full eighteen inches, stops again, and then slams into John Connally’s back. It continues downward and it goes through his wrist, and somehow, they get that right wrist o ver to the left thigh. If you look at the Zapruder Film, you’ll see in the individual frames, that John Connally’s right wrist is not nea r John Connally’s left thigh. The significance of this, the importance cannot be exaggerated. It is impossible to overstate it. Why? Because the Sin gle Bullet Theory is the [mainstay] of the Warren Commission R eport. It’s not a matter of how much weight and credibility do you give to it. It’s a matter of whether or not you have a Single B ullet Theory that permits you to conclude that there was only on e person firing, whether it was Oswald, or anybody else in t he world. If you don’t have a Single Bullet Theory, then you cannot have a sole assassin. And if you move to that point, then you’r e into conspiracy by definition. And that’s why it had to stop with Oswald as a sole assassin. And that’s why they came up with the Single Bullet Theory. There’s no question in my min d that that 26 volume set [the Warren Report] should be taken from the shelves of all the libraries where they now rest in the Uni ted States, from non-fiction and placed in the fiction shelves along with Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Fin, and Gulliver’s Travels bec ause that’s where they belong."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":" 150 (Dr. Cyril Wecht, The Men Who Killed Kennedy , N. Turner) Wecht made an issue out of something that is truly irrelevant: the zigzagging of the single bullet in mid-air. As previously stated, he ignored the four second time delay between the time Kennedy clutched his throat and th e time Connally was obviously hit. The most ridiculous statement Wecht made was when h e described John Connally’s wounds. Here is a repeat of what he said on that to pic: [The Magic Bullet] comes back a full eighteen inche s, stops again, and then slams into John Connally’s back. It continues downward and it goes through his wrist, and somehow , they get that right wrist over to the left thigh. If you loo k at the Zapruder Film, you’ll see in the individual frames, that Joh n Connally’s right wrist is not near John Connally’s left thigh. (Dr. Cyril Wecht, The Men Who Killed Kennedy , N. Turner) Let’s focus on Wecht’s last statement: \"John Connal ly’s right wrist is not near John Connally’s left thigh.\" That was a subtly deceptive statement. As a pathologist, Wecht is fully aware of the nature of Connally’s wounds. As previously stated, Connally was apparently shot by an individual in the vicinity of the upper floors of the Texas School Book Depository. Consequently, it makes perfect sen se that the bullet would have entered Connally’s left thigh because it was travel ing downward and to the left. Remember, his torso was twisted to the right when h e was shot. If Connally’s right wrist was anywhere within a straight-line path betw een his right armpit and his thigh, it would have been hit, and it was. To state that \"John Connally’s right wrist is not n ear John Connally’s left thigh\" was a masterful display of deception by Wecht. If the bul let was traveling on a downward angle, Connally’s right wrist would not need to be near his left thigh for them both get hit by the same bullet. Wecht gave a finale performance that would have mad e Dr. Irwin Corey proud. Wecht cynically continued to pontificate as a bugle sounded towards the end of his diatribe. I think it’s extremely important for the American p eople to know that there can be the overthrow of a government, th at there can be a coup d’etat in America, that that in fact did happen through the assassination of President Kennedy. In order to prevent that kind of thing from happening again, in order to EXP OSE [emphasis] the forces that were responsible for tha t kind of murder and the kind of cover-up that has ensued in the following twenty-five years, it’s necessary to expose it.

[A bugle sounds in th e background.] As painful as it may be, as disruptive as it might be in a transitory nature, as embarrassing as it might be to certain i ndividuals and organizations in the United States government, that has to be uncovered. If they were able to do it to John F. Ke nnedy then; they could do it to some other president in the fut ure. (Dr. Cyril Wecht, The Men Who Killed Kennedy , N. Turner) Oliver Stone One has to wonder how a movie like JFK was made when the American news and entertainment media is almost completely controlled by friends of Israel. But how honest was Stone’s movie, particularly in the area of Israeli/Jewish involvement? Eleven and a half minutes into the movie, the chara cter of Guy Banister (played by Ed Asner) made the following comment as an expression of contempt for Kennedy immediately after hearing of the assassination: That’s what happens when you let the niggers vote. They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart. Those two sentences played an enormous psychologica l trick on the audience. It shielded Jewish groups by giving the false impressi on that Kennedy and Jews were the best of friends. Nothing could have been farthe r from the truth. Stone’s objective was apparently to deceive the public by telling onl y half the story about who killed Kennedy. As I stated earlier, Kennedy was more pro-Hitler th an many people realize. He praised Hitler in his diary in 1945. Later he was s ubtly critical of the Nuremberg Trials in his 1957 book, Profiles in Courage , when he named Senator Robert Taft as a courageous profile for publicly criticizing the Nur emberg Trials while they were in progress in 1946. I believe Stone intentionally add ed the line about \"niggers\" and \"Jews,\" which is pure disinformation, as a means of getting the picture financed by AOL-Time Warner, which is run by Jewish mogul Geral d Levin. ( Footnote 18 ) By adding that one line early in the film, Stone created a ps ychological barrier in the audience’s collective mind which prevented them from entertain ing the possibility that Jewish political interests may have been involved in the a ssassination. Furthermore, I noticed that Stone made no mention o f Permindex, but did quickly mention the Centro Mondiale Commercial (World Trade Center) in the scene where"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" 152 New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (played by actor Kevin Kosner) summoned Clay Shaw (played by actor Tommy Lee Jones ) to his office on Easter Sunday for questioning about his involvement in the Kennedy assassination: [Garrison holds up an Italian newspaper with the he adline \"Clay Shaw - ha lavorato a Roma.\"] Garrison: Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article sayi ng that you were a member of the board of the Centro Mondiale C ommercial in Italy; that this company was a creature of the C IA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political es pionage activity.

(Transcript from JFK , the movie, Oliver Stone) That was an explosive scene, but slightly inaccurat e. The article in the Italian newspaper— Paesa Sera —was real, but Garrison never showed it to Shaw or asked him about it because Garrison himself did not find out about the article until well after the trial of Shaw was over. Had Garrison known of t he article during the trial, the jury likely would have convicted Shaw of conspiracy to m urder President Kennedy. Jurors told researcher and attorney Mark Lane that Garriso n had indeed convinced them that there was a CIA conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy, but that Garrison was unable to link Shaw to the CIA. That article might have chang ed the jurors’ minds had they seen it during the trial. Although it was an error on Stone’s part to state t hat Garrison knew of Shaw’s involvement in Centro Mondiale Commercial prior to indicting Shaw for conspiracy to murder President Kennedy, I can forgive Stone he re because the mention of Centro Mondiale Commercial was barely detectable by most m ovie-goers. I saw the movie JFK twice in the theater and did not pick up on Garris on’s mention of Centro Mondiale Commercial. It likely didn’t register with me because Centro Mondiale Commercial is an Italian name which I had never hea rd of at that time. When I first saw the movie JFK , I had not read Garrison’s book, On the Trail of the Assassins , which explains Centro Mondiale Commercial and its h alf-brother corporation Permindex in more detail."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" 155 It wasn’t until after I read Garrison’s book, then rented a video cassette of JFK the movie, that I picked up on the dialogue which menti oned Centro Mondiale Commercial only one time. I doubt that one-tenth of one percent of the people who watched JFK the movie recall the mention of Centro Mondiale Commercial. This poses an interesting question. Why did Stone p ut it in the movie? It is completely worthless to the plot since it is essentially undet ectable? The topic of Centro Mondiale Commercial is a sensit ive area that gets into the uncomfortable area of Jewish political interests in volved in the Kennedy assassination. In my opinion, Stone likely mentioned Centro Mondia le Commercial to gain credibility among serious researchers of the Kenned y assassination, but without jeopardizing distribution by Jewish controlled AOL- Time Warner. Nevertheless, Stone’s script accurately described t he article in the Italian newspaper, Paesa Sera, but no mention was made of Louis Bloomf ield from Montreal who was also mentioned in the article as \"Major Bloomfield. \" According to Garrison’s book, On the Trail of the Assassins , which Stone cited as the basis of the movie—along with Jim Marrs’ Crossfire , this is what the article in Paesa Sera actually stated about Shaw and Bloomfield: Among its possible involvements ...is that the Center was the creature of the CIA...set up as a cover for the trans fer of CIA...funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities. It still remains to clear up the presence on the administrat ive Board of the Center of Clay Shaw and ex-Major Bloomfield. (Jim Garrison, On the Trail of the Assassin , p. 103) Why did Oliver Stone omit the article’s mention of Louis Bloomfield, a lawyer for billionaire Jewish Zionist Sam Bronfman? Garrison’s book did not mention that Bloomfield was Bronfman’s lawyer, but Jim Marrs’ bo ok, Crossfire , did. Here is what Marrs wrote about Bloomfield and his connection to Sam Bronfman: The Italian media reported that [Ferenc] Nagy was p resident of Permindex and the board chairman and major stockhol der was Maj. Louis Mortimer Bloomfield, a powerful Montreal lawyer who represented the Bronfman family as well as serving U.S. intelligence services. (Jim Marrs, Crossfire , p. 499) At this point, there is little doubt that Oliver St one was intentionally directing viewers of the movie JFK away from Israel, even though the two books— On the Trail of the Assassins and Crossfire , which he credits as the basis for the movie—did i n fact point to Israel when they mentioned Louis Bloomfield and the Bronfman family. "},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" 156 Noam Chomsky Noam Chomsky, the prestigious left-wing Jewish inte llectual, is not a fake critic of the Warren Report. On the contrary, he endorses it wholeheartedly. Although his field is linguistics, he often strays into political disc ussions. In 1993, Chomsky wrote a book, Rethinking Camelot , which gave a backhanded endorsement to the Warren Commission’s conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald alon e killed President Kennedy. One of Chomsky’s weakest arguments is to belittle c onspiracy theories in general. Either Kennedy was killed by a lone assassin or he wasn’t. If you believe the former, then you essentially believe the Warren Report. If you believe the latter, then a conspiracy is a likely alternative. One can disbeli eve the Warren Report without knowing what really happened or why. The mere fact that a so-called intellectual would engage in bashing all conspiracies reveals a hidden agenda and discredits him as a truth seeker. The following is an excerpt from Chapter 9, The Kennedy Revival , of Chomsky’s 1993 book, Rethinking Camelot , which gives tacit endorsement of the Warren Repor t: The Kennedy revival involves disparate groups. One consists of leading intellectuals of the Kennedy circle. What i s interesting in this case is not their rising to Kennedy's defense, but the way they seized upon the idea that Kennedy was planning to withdraw from Vietnam, the timing of this thesis, and the co mparison to the version of these events they had provided before th e war became unpopular among elites. Among this group, few if an y credit the belief that the alleged withdrawal plans, or other planned policy reversals, were a factor in the assassination. A second category includes segments of the popular movements that in large part grew from opposition to the Viet nam war. Their attitudes toward the man who escalated the war from terror to aggression are perhaps more surprising, though it s hould be recalled that the picture of Kennedy as the leader who was about to lead us to a bright future of peace and justice was carefully nurtured during the Camelot years, with no little s uccess, and has been regularly revived in the course of the critiqu e of the Warren report and the attempts to construct a different pi cture, which have reached and influenced a wide audience over th e years. Within both categories, some have taken the positio n that JFK truly departed from the political norm, and had bec ome (or always was) committed to far-reaching policy change s: not only was he planning to withdraw from Vietnam (the core thesis), but also to break up the CIA and the military-industria l complex, to end the Cold War, and otherwise to pursue direction s that would indeed have been highly unpopular in the corridors of power. Others reject these assessments, but argue that Ken nedy was perceived as a dangerous reformer by right-wing ele ments (which is undoubtedly true, as it is true of virtually eve ryone in public"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" 157 life). At this point, the speculations interweave w ith questions and theories about the assassination. Some take the pos ition that Kennedy was assassinated by a high-level conspiracy determined to make sure that their own man, the haw kish LBJ, would take the reins. It is then necessary to assum e further that a conspiracy of quite a remarkable character has conc ealed the awesome crime. There are other variants. Of all of these theories, the only ones of any gene ral interest are those that assume a massive cover-up, and a high-le vel conspiracy that required that operation. In that ca se, the assassination was an event of true political signif icance, breaking sharply from the normal course of politics and exer cise of power. Such ideas make little sense unless coupled with th e thesis that JFK was undertaking radical policy changes, or perc eived to be by policy insiders. The scale of the presumed conspiracy should be appr eciated. There is not a phrase in the voluminous internal re cord hinting at any thought of such a notion. It must be, then, tha t personal discipline was extraordinary among a huge number of people, or that the entire record has been scrupulously saniti zed. There has not been a single leak over thirty years, though a high-level conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy and conceal the c rime would have to involve not only much of the government and the media, but a good part of the historical, scientific, and medical professions. An achievement so immense would be utt erly without precedent or even remote analogue. The conviction that JFK was assassinated by a high- level conspiracy, and that the crime has since been conce aled by a conspiracy awesome in scale, is widely held in the grassroots movements and among left intellectuals. Indeed, it is often presented as established truth, the starting point for further discussion. Across this broad spectrum, there is a shared belie f that history changed course dramatically when Kennedy was assass inated in November 1963. Many believe that the event casts a shadow over all that followed, opening an era of political illegitimacy, with the country in the hands of dark forces. Given the strong reactions that these issues have r aised, perhaps it is worthwhile to make clear just what is and is not under consideration in what follows. This discussio n addresses the question of the assassination only at the polic y level: is there any reason to believe that JFK broke from the gener al pattern and intended to withdraw US forces from Vietnam eve n if that would lead to \"impairment of the war effort\" and un dermine the"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":" 158 \"fundamental objective of victory\"? Ancillary quest ions arise concerning the further beliefs about impending poli cy changes. These questions are addressed below. The issue of the assassination is only obliquely to uched by these considerations. They imply nothing about the thesis that JFK was killed by the Mafia, or by right-wing Cubans, or ot her such theories. They bear only on the thesis that Kennedy was killed in a high-level conspiracy followed by a cover-up of r emarkable dimensions. Serious proponents of such theses have recognized that credible direct evidence is lacking, and have therefore sought indirect evidence, typically holding that JF K's plans for withdrawal from Vietnam (or some of the broader pol icy claims) provide the motive for the cabal. If serious, the c laim must be that the high-level conspirators knew something not publ icly available, or had beliefs based on such material; hence the im portance of the internal planning record for advocates of such theses. This line of argument has been at the core of the reviva l of the past few years. Currently available evidence indicates t hat it is entirely without foundation, indeed in conflict with substan tial evidence. Advocates of the thesis will have to look elsewhere , so it appears. The available facts, as usual, lead us to seek the institutional sources of policy decisions and their stability. In dividuals and personal whim doubtless make a difference; one migh t, for example, speculate that the notorious Kennedy macho streak might have led to dangerous escalation in Indochina , or that he might have leaned towards an enclave strategy of th e type advocated by his close adviser General Maxwell Tayl or, or a Nixonian modification with intensified bombing and murderous \"accelerated pacification\" but many fewer US ground combat forces; while at home, he might not have committed himself to \"great society\" and civil rights issues to the exte nt LBJ did. Or one might make other guesses. They are baseless, an d hold little interest. In the present case, there is a rich reco rd to assist us in understanding the roots of policy and its implement ation. People who want to understand and change the world will do well, in my opinion, to pay attention to it, not to engage in g roundless speculation as to what one or another leader might have done. (Noam Chomsky, Rethinking Camelot , excerpt from Chapter 9, The Kennedy Revival ) I wish to make a few specific points about Chomsky’s anti-conspiracy diatribe . Much of his argument against conspiracy theories centers around the inaccurate use of the word \"thesis\" when referring to Kennedy’s plans to withdraw from US military forces South Vietnam. It is not a thesis, an opinion, or a proposition; it is a verifiable fact. The following is a transcript—from a press conferen ce on October 31, 1963—of"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" 159 Kennedy’s announcement to withdraw a thousand men f rom South Vietnam by the end of 1963: [REPORTER:] Mr. President, back to the question of troop reductions, are any intended in the far east at the present time – particularly in Korea and is there any speedup in t he withdrawal from Vietnam intended? [PRESIDENT KENNEDY:] Well as you know, when Secreta ry McNamara and General Taylor came back, they announc ed that we would expect to withdraw a thousand men from Sou th Vietnam before the end of the year. And there has b een some reference to that by General Harkins. If we’re able to do that, that will be our schedule. I think the first unit, the f irst contingent, would be 250 men who are not involved in what might be called front-line operations. It would be our hope to less on the number of Americans there by a thousand as the training in tensifies and is carried on in South Vietnam. (from JFK’s press conference, October 31, 1963) Although Chomsky avoided stating overtly that he be lieved the Warren Report, he came pretty close with the following statement: \"Th ere is not a phrase in the voluminous internal record hinting at any thought o f such a notion [conspiracy].\" I assume the phrase \"voluminous internal record\" mean s the 26 volumes of the Warren Report. If Chomsky had truly read all 26 volumes, a s he suggests he did, he would know that they contain plenty of phrases which do m ore than merely hint at a conspiracy. A good example is Volume 11 of the Warren Commissio n Hearings, pp. 325 - 339, where Dean Andrews was interviewed—on July 21, 1964 —by Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the Warren Commission (excerpt of transcript is in Chapter 3). Under oath, Andrews identified Clay Bertrand as the man who phoned him requesting legal representation for Lee Harvey Oswald. After a close reading of the cited transcript, it becomes apparent that Andrews realiz ed he was in potential danger after telling the FBI that he received a phone call to de fend Oswald. Consequently, he began to have memory lapses about Bertrand’s appear ance. The cited transcript indicates that Bertrand had shrunk six inches—from six feet two (per Andrews’s original description in an FBI report) all the way down to five feet eight inches which is how he described Bertrand to Liebeler. In fact, Liebeler grilled Andrews extensively about the discrepancy between his confl icting descriptions of Bertrand’s height. Later it became known that Clay Bertrand was actual ly Clay Shaw, who was linked to international espionage activities with Louis Bloom field, one of Israel’s most influential supporters.

Later, in August 1967, Andrews was found guilty of perjury by a jury of New Orleans citizens. 25 As a result, Andrews was sentenced to five months in the Parish prison. 26 The stated perjury conviction linked Bloomfield directly to Os wald because Shaw was obviously Oswald’s handler, and Shaw and Bloomfield were link ed to subversive intelligence activity via Permindex and Centro Mondiale Commerci ale. This is just one example of how the \"voluminous int ernal record\" indicates that there was a conspiracy, thereby refuting Chomsky’s statem ent to the contrary. Another example of conspiracy is the Zapruder film which I described in great detail at the beginning of this chapter. Frankly, the timing of Chomsky’s support of the War ren Report was unfortunate for his image as an outspoken intellectual. His book, Rethinking Camelot , was published in 1993—around the time that most media outlets sto pped endorsing the Warren Report. Michael Kazin & Maurice Isserman In 2000, Jewish authors, Michael Kazin and Maurice Isserman wrote a book, America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s . In the fall of that year, Kazin and Isserman gave a joint lecture at a book signing event in Washingt on, DC to promote their new book. I attended the event which was held at \"Politics an d Prose,\" a well-known bookstore in Washington, DC. In their book, I noticed that th ey aggressively supported the official explanations of the murders of Robert Kenn edy and Martin Luther King; however, they steered clear of making a similar end orsement of the Warren Report. Regarding Robert Kennedy, they inaccurately stated that his assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, was a \"psychotic\" Palestinian immigrant. During the question and answer session, I asked if they had any evidence that Sirhan Sirhan w as psychotic because I had always heard that he was a model prisoner. Kazin admitted that it was an exaggeration. I followed up by asking him why they did not take a s imilar position regarding President Kennedy’s assassination after clearly sta ting that they accepted the government’s explanation for the murders of RFK and MLK. In fact I put a direct question to Kazin: \"Do you believe the Warren Repor t?\" He responded: \"Yes I do, but I didn’t put it the book in because the conventiona l wisdom these days is not to believe it.\" Kazin’s oral answer summed up the general position of the news media today regarding the Kennedy assassination. They secretly endorse the Warren Report but won’t put it in writing because few people believe it anymore. Hence, they would lose their audience if they supported it directly.

The Bronfman family— based in Montreal, Canada—is one of the most influe ntial behind the scenes power brokers in the world today. Sam Bronfman (1891 - 19 71) was the patriarch of the family dynasty, the son of Russian Jews—Mindel and Ekiel Bronfman—who migrated to the Americas seeking refuge from pogrom s of Czarist Russia. 1 His son, Edgar Bronfman, has been the president of the World Jewish Congress for years. Edgar’s son—Edgar Bronfman, Jr—is head of Universal Studios. Sam Bronfman—a billionaire—was one of attorney Loui s Bloomfield’s wealthiest clients. Bronfman made his fortune as a bootlegger during US prohibition. He bought Seagram’s and built it into a liquor dynasty. In 19 63, former bootlegger Bronfman plunged into an unfamiliar business venture by aggr essively purchasing huge oil holdings. He acquired Texas Pacific Oil and its sub sidiaries in India, Malaysia, Guatemala, Indonesia, and Italy; 2 plus Ranger Oil. Bronfman biographer Michael Marrus summarized Sam B ronfman’s sudden interest in oil as follows: In 1963, when production was about 10,000 barrels a day, Sam made his biggest plunge with the purchase of Texas Pacific, a major producer—\"the venerable Texas Pacific Coal an d Oil Company, founded in 1888 and possessing one of the oldest of Texas charters,\" said Sam about the pedigree, speak ing as if it were a famous distillery. While it is doubtful that Sam foresaw the energy crisis of subsequent decades as he later cla imed, there is no question that his acquisition was a remarkable f inancial coup—at a time when \"leveraged buyouts\" were a conc ept of the future. With a Seagram working capital of $382 mill ion and earnings of $34 million a year, Sam borrowed $75 mi llion from institutional investors, in 25-year promissory note s. He put $50 million of that as a downpayment on the Texas Pacif ic purchase price of $266 million, and undertook to pay the bal ance out of future revenues—a strategy then facilitated by US t ax laws. The key player in these arrangements was Mark Millard, a partner in Loeb, Rhoades and Co. and the man who had recommend ed the appointment of Carrol Bennett. Millard convinced Sa m of the wisdom of the oil payment scheme and nudged him to make a Seagram bid. By 1975, Texas Pacific had paid off its debt, while in the process its oil and gas reserves expanded phenomenally. A h andsome legacy to Seagram, the company proved to be one of Sam’s shrewdest moves; bought with only $50 million in bo rrowed cash, it was sold in 1980 to the Sun Oil Company for a gr and total of"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":" 164 $2.3 billion. Here too, Mark Millard played a major role. A decade after Sam’s death, Seagram used this capital to acq uire a 20 percent interest in Dupont, taking the company that Sam had built from being a large wine and spirits company to a ma jor diversified corporation. (Michael Marrus, Samuel Bronfman , pp. 372-373) Kennedy’s Oil Tax It’s interesting Sam Bronfman invested heavily in f oreign subsidiaries of Texas Pacific in 1963. Kennedy had placed a heavy tax bur den on foreign subsidiaries of US oil companies. Once Kennedy was removed from office , Bronfman’s oil investments began to increase. The following is researcher Jim Marrs’ description of Kennedy’s oil tax: When John F. Kennedy became President in 1961, the oil industry felt secure. But President Kennedy then be gan to assault the power of the oil giants directly, first with a law known as the Kennedy Act, and later by attacking the oil depleti on allowance. The Kennedy Act, passed on October 16, 1962, remove d the distinction between repatriated profits and profits reinvested abroad. Both were now subject to US taxation. The m easure also was aimed at preventing taxable income from being h idden away in foreign subsidiaries and other tax havens. While this law applied to industry as a whole, it particularly aff ected the oil companies, which were greatly diversified with larg e overseas operations. By the end of 1962, oilmen estimated their earnings on foreign investment capital would fall to 15 percent, compar ed with 30 percent in 1955. One of the most sacred of provisions in the eyes of oilmen was the oil depletion allowance, which permitted oil pr oducers to treat up to 27.5 percent of their income as tax exempt. I n theory this was to compensate for the depletion of fixed oil re serves but, in effect, it gave the oil industry a lower tax rate. Under this allowance, an oilman with a good deal of venture ca pital could become rich with virtually no risk. For example, a speculator could drill ten wells. If nine were dry holes and o nly the tenth struck oil, he would still make money because of ta x breaks and the depletion allowance. It was estimated that oilmen might lose nearly $300 million a year"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":" 165 if the depletion allowance was diminished. Attempts to eliminate or reduce the depletion allow ance were rebuffed year after year by congressmen, many of wh om were happy recipients of oil-industry contributions. Speaking of his tax reform act of 1963, President K ennedy pointed the finger at the oil companies, saying: \"... no one industry should be permitted to obtain an undue tax advantage over all others.\" Included in Kennedy’s tax package were provisions f or closing a number of corporate tax loopholes, including the de pletion allowance. Needless to say, oilmen both in Texas an d elsewhere felt threatened by Kennedy and his policies. Kenned y’s use of his personal power against the steel manufacturers had shown them that the young President meant the enforce his will in these matters. (Jim Marrs, Crossfire , pp. 276-277) Was Sam Bronfman’s acquisition of Texas Pacific Oil truly a \"shrewd move\" as biographer Michael Marrus described, or was it a pe rk for participating in President Kennedy’s assassination? ‘Suicide’ of Bronfman Biographer, Terrence Robertso n Other strange events followed the Bronfman family. In 1970, Bronfman biographer Terrence Robertson committed \"suicide\" after he \"fo und out things they don’t want me to write about,\" as he confided to an associate. Canadian writer Peter Newman wrote of Robertson’s death in his 1978 biography of Sam Bronfman, King of the Castle . Newman wrote the following: Terence Robertson, the only writer known to have pr eviously attempted a Bronfman biography (it was never publis hed), took his own life after completing a rough draft of the manuscript. During a 1977 trial in which the Toronto publishing firm of McClelland and Stewart Ltd sued Mutual Life Assuran ce Co. to collect the $100,000 for which Robertson’s life had been insured, Roderick Goodman of the Toronto Daily Star’s editor ial department testified that on January 31, 1970, the author had telephoned him from a New York hotel room to explai n that he had been commissioned to write the history of the B ronfman family but that he had \"found out things they don’t want me to write about.\" Graham Murray Caney, another Star edi tor, testified that Robertson had told him his life \"had been thre atened and we"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" 166 would know who was doing the threatening but that h e would do the job himself.\" While he was still on the telepho ne, Caney had the call traced and alerted the New York Police Dep artment. Detectives burst into Terence Robertson’s hotel roo m just minutes before he died of barbiturate poisoning. ... (Peter Newman, King of the Castle , p. ix.) Israel’s History of Terror Israel’s history is filled with terror and murder. In 1948, Jewish terrorists shot and killed UN peace mediator in the Mid-East, Count Fol ke Bernadotte of Sweden. It is widely accepted that Bernadotte was assassinated by a Jewish terrorist group known as the Stern Gang. Former Israeli prime minister Yi tzhak Shamir was a member of the Stern Gang. Shamir’s predecessor, Menachem Begin, w as the commander of another Jewish terrorist group, Irgun Zvai Leumi (Hebrew: N ational Military Organization), from 1943 to 1948. On July 22, 1946, the Irgun blew up the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, killing 91 soldiers and civilians (Briti sh, Arab, and Jewish). The objective of the bombing was to drive the British from Palest ine, thereby setting the stage for Israel to become an independent nation in 1948. 3 On April 9, 1947, Irgun commandos assaulted the Ara b village of Dayr Yasin, killing all 254 of its inhabitants. 4 The objective of the Dayr Yasin massacre was to se nd a message to all Palestinians who had lived in the re gion for centuries: Get out. Years later, Israel rewarded terrorists Begin and Shamir by making them prime ministers. In my opinion, electing Shamir and Begin as prime mini sters of Israel would be like electing Timothy McVeigh as president of the United States. The only difference is that one may legitimately question McVeigh’s centra l role in the Oklahoma City Bombing. With Begin and Shamir, there is no doubt o f their leadership roles. In 1995, Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was a ssassinated because he wanted to give land back to the Palestinians. Ironically, in 1997, John Kennedy, Jr ran a story in George Magazine by Guela Amir, mother of Yigal Amir, the man who a ssassinated Rabin. In that article, Guela Amir charged that her son Yigal was goaded into assassinating Rabin by Avishai Raviv, an agent prov ocateur working for Shin Bet, one of Israel’s intelligence services. In the editor’s note of that same edition of George Magazine, the younger Kennedy essentially acknowledged that he did not believe th e Warren Report. Referring to representatives of Guela Amir’s family’s efforts to contact him about running her story in George Magazine, he wrote, \"They were, no doubt, hoping that my own family history would bring added attention to their story, and they probably were right.\" In July 1999, John F. Kennedy, Jr was kille d when his private plane crashed. Guela Amir’s article, \"A Mother’s Defense,\" is pres ented in Appendix B . It was published in the March 1997 edition of George Magazine ."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" 167 Israel’s Political Parties & Prime Ministers There have been three major political parties in Is rael since its founding in 1948. They are as follows: \u0001 Mapai Party : Early political party in Palestine/Israel that in 1930 became the central partner in the Labour Party. 5 \u0001 Labour Party : Political party formed in January 1968 by uniting three socialist-labour parties—Mapai, Labour, and Rafi. 6 \u0001 Likud Party : (Hebrew: Consolidation, or Unity) An ultra-right political party, founded in 1973, with roots in terrorism. Likud is an alliance of several right- wing parties—the major constituent being the Gahal bloc consisting of the Herut party and the Liberal Party. The Herut origin ated from the Russian Jewish Zionism of the 1920s and ‘30s, was formally organized in the year of Israel’s independence (1948), and was merged with o rganizations like Irgun Zvai Leumi—a terrorist organization—and the Haganah . 7 The following is a list of Israel’s prime ministers since its founding in 1948: Term Name Party 1948-53 David Ben-Gurion Mapai 1953-55 Moshe Sharett Mapai 1955-63 David Ben-Gurion Mapai 1963-69 Levi Eshkol Mapai/Labour 1969-74 Golda Meir Labour 1974-77 Yitzhak Rabin Labour 1977-83 Menachem Begin Likud 1983-84 Yitzhak Shamir Likud 1984-86 Shimon Peres Labour-Likud coalition government 1986-92 Yitzhak Shamir Likud 1992-95 Yitzhak Rabin Labour 1995-96 Shimon Peres Labour 1996-99 Binyamin Netanyahu Likud"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":" 168 1999-01 Ehud Barak Labour 2001- Ariel Sharon Likud In 1977 the Israeli government took a turn to the e xtreme right with the election of Menachem Begin, head of the radical right-wing Liku d party. Begin, a former terrorist, was succeeded by another former terroris t, Yitzahak Shamir. These two men ran the Israel government for 15 years, from 1977 u ntil 1992; however, Shimon Peres was prime minister and head of the Labour party fro m 1984 until 1986 in a Labour- Likud coalition government with Shamir serving as t he number two man, deputy prime minister and foreign minister. In other words , Israel was ruled for fifteen years—from 1977 until 1992—by the same terrorists ( i.e., Begin and Shamir) who assassinated Count Folke Bernadotte, blew up the Ki ng David Hotel in Jerusalem, and assaulted the Arab village of Dayr Yasin. In 1992 the fifteen-year Likud reign ended with the election of Yitzhak Rabin as prime minister who began negotiating with the PLO. This infuriated the right, and Rabin was assassinated on November 4, 1995 by Yigal Amir, an Israeli of Yemenite origin. Rabin’s assassination was similar to Presid ent Kennedy’s wherein the official government explanations for both murders were ident ical. In both instances, the government determined that the victim was murdered by a loan gunman and there was no conspiracy. Like Kennedy’s death, many people do not believe the official story regarding Rabin’s assassination. In fact evidence h as been revealed showing that Rabin’s assassin, Yigal Amir, was goaded into killi ng the prime minister by Avishai Raviv, ( Footnote 19 ) an agent provocateur working for Shin Bet—also kno wn as the General Security Service (GSS)—an Israeli version o f the FBI and Secret Service combined. 8 A Peculiar Offer An interesting fact pointing to Israeli involvement in President Kennedy’s assassination was Israel’s proposition to candidate Kennedy, in the 1960 presidential campaign, that he allow Jews to run Middle-Eastern affairs, if elected, in exchange for a huge campaign contribution. The following is an e xcerpt from Richard Reeves’ book about JFK: The day in New York also gave him a chance to meet for the first time Israel's prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, who was also in New York on a fund-raising trip, meeting American J ews whose generosity was critical to the survival of his twel ve-year-old state. They met against a background of suspicion. Jewish Democrats, particularly in New York, did not yet fully trust t he son of a man who had been accused of being both anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi. Nor did John Kennedy, comfortably surrounded by Jew ish staff members, trust all Jews, particularly New Yorkers. \"I had the damnedest meeting in New York last night,\" he had s aid to his"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":" 169 friend Charlie Bartlett one day in the early fall o f 1960. \"I went to this party. It was given by a group of people who w ere big money contributors and also Zionists and they said to me, 'We know that your campaign is in terrible financial shape!'...Th e deal they offered me was that they would finance the rest of this campaign if I would agree to let them run the Middle Eastern policy of the United States for the next four years.\" Kennedy greeted Ben-Gurion with talk of gut-level p olitics. It usually worked, politician to politician. This time it didn't. \"You know I was elected by the Jews,\" Kennedy said. \"I w as elected by the Jews of New York. I have to do something for th em. I will do something for you.\" Ben-Gurion was offended. He was the founder and leader of a nation, not a politician fr om Brooklyn. (Richard Reeves, President Kennedy: Profile of Power , pp. 143-144) Apparently every president after Kennedy was given a similar offer that Kennedy received – to let Jews run US Middle Eastern policy in exchange for financing a presidential campaign. For any doubters, ask yourse lves this question: How could US Middle Eastern policy have been more pro-Israel, wh ether Zionists had been running it or not? Israel has no strategic advantage to the United States whatsoever. Yet we support them over the oil-producing Arab nations. AIPAC’s Control of US Politicians The most influential power broker in the United Sta tes—and likely the world—is the powerful Jewish lobby, the American Israel Public A ffairs Committee (AIPAC). Politicians who oppose Israel, or take fair minded views on Mid-East affairs, must answer to the aggressive lobby group. Former Congre ssman Paul McCloskey and former senators George McGovern, James Abourezk, Jo hn Glenn, Charles Percy, and countless other politicians have felt the wrath of AIPAC for not showing the proper respect to Israel. AIPAC uses two tactics to destro y its perceived political enemies. They openly charge that the target politician is an ti-semitic, or they block funding to his/her campaign. 9 Both tactics are tantamount to blacklisting. Endnotes 1.

Every president after Johnson h as totally capitulated to Israel and ignored the plight of Palestinians. But Johnson mar ked the turning point. The reason he was so loyal to Israel lies within his own ethni city. It appears that he and his wife were secretly Jewish. To many, this may seem laugha ble at first, but in reality Jews were an integral part of Texas history throughout t he nineteenth century. 1 Jacob and Phineas De Cordova sold land and developed Waco. Si mon Mussina founded Brownsville in 1848. Michael Seeligson was elected mayor of Galveston in 1853. Morris Lasker was elected to the state Senate in 18 95. 2 The list goes on. The first Jewish settlers of note in Texas were Sam uel Issacks (1821) followed by N. Adolphus Sterne (1826). 3 By 1838, Jews were living in Galveston, San Antoni o, Velasco, Bolivar, Nacogdoches, and Goliad. 4 In the early part of the twentieth century, a large of number of Russian Jews migrated to Texas to escape persecution from the Russian Czar. Between 1900 and 1920, the Jewish pop ulation in Texas grew from 15,000 to 30,000. Major cities, Dallas, Houston, Fo rt Worth, and San Antonio, experienced enormous growth in Jewish populations. 5 The overall number of Jews in Texas has steadily increased ever since. After Worl d War II, the abundance of Jewish residents grew from an estimated 50,000 in 1945 to 71,000 in the mid-1970s and 92,000 in 1988. 6 Before 1821, Texas was still a Spanish colony where only Catholics could take up residence. Jews who openly acknowledged their ethni city could not legally live there. 7 Originally, Jews migrated to Texas to seek fortune and freedom. The earliest Jews, who arrived with the conquistadors, came from Sepha rdic (Spanish-North African- Israel) communities. 8 After the Mexican period, Jewry in Texas was essen tially populated by immigrants from Germany, eastern Europ e, and the Americas. 9 Lyndon Johnson’s maternal ancestors, the Huffmans, apparently migrated to Frederick, Maryland from Germany sometime in the mi d-eighteenth century. Later they moved to Bourbon, Kentucky and eventually sett led in Texas in the mid-to-late nineteenth century. 10 According to Jewish law, if a person’s mother is Je wish, then that person is automatically Jewish, regardless of the father’s et hnicity or religion. The facts indicate that both of Lyndon Johnson’s great-grandp arents, on the maternal side, were Jewish. These were the grandparents of Lyndon’s mot her, Rebecca Baines. 11 Their names were John S. Huffman and Mary Elizabeth Perri n. 12 John Huffman’s mother was Suzanne Ament, a common Jewish name. Perrin is also a common Jewish name. Huffman and Perrin had a daughter, Ruth Ament Huffm an, 13 who married Joseph Baines 14 and together they had a daughter, Rebekah Baines, 15 Lyndon Johnson’s mother. The line of Jewish mothers can be traced ba ck three generations in Lyndon Johnson’s family tree. There is little doubt that h e was Jewish. To recap, the following is Lyndon Johnson’s materna l family tree:"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":" 171 \u0001 Mother: Rebekah Baines (married Sam Johnson, Lyndon ’s father) \u0001 Maternal grandparents: Ruth Ament Huffman and Josep h Baines \u0001 Maternal great-grandparents (parents of Ruth Huffma n): Mary Elizabeth Perrin and John S.

Huffman, II 17 o Maternal great-great-great grandparents (parents of John Huffman, II): Cathrine Lyter and John Huffman 18 As previously stated, many Jews migrated to Texas f rom Germany. A Johnson family friend, Cynthia Crider, observed that Lyndon’s moth er, Rebekah Baines (Johnson), often boasted of her Baines ancestry, but rarely me ntioned the maternal side, the Huffmans. In fact, Crider recalled that Lyndon’s fa ther, Sam Johnson, used to tease his wife occasionally about her German heritage. Wh en she would get stubborn about something, Sam would say, \"That’s your German blood again. German blood! Look at your brother’s name. Huffman! Probably was Hoffm ann once—in Berlin.\" Rebekah would respond, \"Sam, you know it’s Holland Dutch.\" 19 As far as I can determine, Rebekah’s German ancesto rs, the Huffmans, came to America in the mid-1700s and had a son, John Huffma n, in about 1767 in Frederick, Maryland. I cannot find records of John Huffman’s p arents. They were probably German immigrants. Huffman married Catherine Lyter in 1790 in Frederick, Maryland. 20 At some point Huffman and Lyter moved to Bourbon, Kentucky and had a son, John Huffman, II, who married Suzanne Ament. Huffman, II and Ament had a son, John S. Huffman, III, born on May 7, 1824 in B ourbon, Kentucky; and died on June 22, 1865 in Collin, Texas. John Huffman, III w as Rebekah’s great-grandfather. He married Mary Elizabeth Perrin. Huffman and Perri n had a daughter, Ruth Ament Huffman, who married Joseph Baines. Huffman and Bai nes were Rebekah’s parents, Lyndon’s grandparents. As a young adult, Lyndon Johnson taught school in C otulla, a poor \"Mexican\" community south of San Antonio. 21 Many of his former students marvelled at his spirit, dedication and self-discipline. 22 Lyndon strongly encouraged the young Mexicans to learn English in order to get ahead. 23 Possibly he truly had a yearning to help those in need; however, that does not fit most historical accounts of Lyndon Johnson the man. From early adulthood, virtually al l of his actions were calculated. Given Lyndon’s Huffman, Perrin, Ament family line, it is more likely that he was assisting descendants of Sephardic Jews who migrate d to Texas from Spain centuries earlier. Recently it was disclosed that there are many hispa nic Jews living in the San Antonio area. Richard Santos, a hispanic Jew and native of San Antonio, wrote a book entitled Silent Heritage: The Sephardim and the Colonization of the Spanish North American Frontier, 1492-1600 . 24 Santos spoke of his \"crypto-Jewish\" heritage at th e Texas Jewish Historical Society’s 22nd conference on May 11, 2001. Crypto-Jews are Sephardic groups of families who secretly retained their religion and culture after the 15th-century Spanish royal decree deemed it punisha ble by death. Santos has spent"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" 172 his entire adult life trying to educate the masses about the secret history of his bloodline. 25 Stan Hordes, a former New Mexico state historian an d professor at the University of New Mexico, described his observations at the same conference. \"One person told me, ‘My family just doesn’t eat po rk—we’re allergic to pork,’\" Hordes said, explaining the pockets of crypto-Jews who maintain Jewish traditions without even realizing it. 26 Among the crypto-Jews that Hordes described, some o f the women light menorahs without realizing what they’re doing. 27 Given this new information about crypto-Jews, plus Johnson’s heritage; it is highly plausible that he began his early adult life as a t eacher at Cotulla not merely to help disadvantaged hispanics students, but rather to hel p descendants of Sephardic Jews— crypto-Jews—from Spain who migrated to Mexico and w hat is now southern Texas. And the reason he felt obliged to help these crypto -Jews was because of his own secret ethnicity. This information about Sephardic Jews in southern T exas sheds new light on the ethnicity of Lyndon Johnson’s wife, Claudia Alta Ta ylor Johnson (aka, \"Lady Bird\"). She is apparently a Sephardic Jew of Mexican origin . Although her facial features are consistent with Semitic origin, that alone is not d efinitive proof. Claudia’s mother, Minnie Lee Pattillo, was likely a Sephardic Jew fro m Mexico. Pattillo is a common Spanish/Mexican name; however, there are no records of Minnie Pattillo’s parents so it is entirely possible that they were immigrants. It is quite odd that a first lady—one who lived in the White House less than 40 years ago —has maternal grandparents whose identity is unknown and undocumented. Minnie Pattillo died in 1918 when Claudia was only five. 28 Minnie was born in about 1890 in Karnack, Texas (Harrison County); 29 however, she apparently lived in Alabama when Thomas Taylor married her. 30 All that is known about Minnie Pattillo is that she had a \"spinster\" sister, Effie Pattillo (also from Alabama), who helped raise Claudia. 31 Claudia Taylor’s father was Thomas Jefferson Taylor , II, a prosperous businessman and philanthropist. 32 He was the son of Thomas Jefferson Taylor and Emma Louisa Bates. 33 Historian Robert Caro wrote that Claudia’s father was the \"richest man in [Karnack, Texas].\" 34 Caro also indicated that Johnson’s previous two gi rlfriends— Carol Davis and Kitty Clyde of San Marcos and Johns on City, respectively—were also daughters of the richest men in town. 1931: Johnson Came to Washington as Congressman Kle berg’s Assistant Lyndon Johnson began his career in 1931 as the legi slative assistant of Congressman Richard M. Kleberg, a wealthy Jewish politician rep resenting the 14 th District of"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":" 173 Texas. Kleberg was not a serious politician, rather an outwardly friendly man who inherited vast wealth. \"A sweeter man that Dick Kle berg never lived,\" a friend said. \"But he was a playboy. As for work, he had no inter est in that whatsover.\" 35 Richard Kleberg was one of the wealthiest men in Te xas. He inherited twenty percent interest in the King Ranch, the largest ranch in th e continental United States; 36 a 2,000-square-mile estate with influence extending b eyond its borders. 37 In fact, Richard Kleberg’s father, Robert Kleberg, turned mu ch of South Texas into \"Kleberg County.\" 38 Although the ranch dealt in cattle and horses, as well as in sorghum and wheat, 39 it also built entire towns, railroads, harbors, co lleges, and banks. 40 In the 1940s, it contracted oil and gas leases to provide additional income. By the mid-1970s, the ranch owned millions of acres of land in such c ountries as Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, and Morocco; but falling market prices caused them to sell off much of this land in the 1980s. 41 The King Ranch was founded in 1852 by Richard King (Richard Kleberg’s grandfather), and was expanded significantly by Kin g’s son-in-law, Robert Kleberg (Richard Kleberg’s father). 42 In 1922 Robert Kleberg suffered a stroke and Richa rd was put in charge of the King Ranch. But Richard’s lack of business skills soon caused the King empire to fall into serious financi al difficulties. In 1927, the executors of his father’s estate removed Richard fr om authority and put his younger brother in charge of managing the Ranch. Soon the e mpire was back on its feet. This did not bother Richard because he did not relish th e notion of being a businessman. 43 Richard Kleberg ran for an open congressional seat merely as a favor to friend, Roy Miller, former \"boy mayor of Corpus Christi\" and lo bbyist for the gigantic Texas Gulf Sulphur Corporation. 44 Kleberg replaced Harry Wurchbach who died on Novem ber 6, 1931. At that time, Wurchbach was the only Republic an Congressman from Texas. 45 With Kleberg’s election, the Democrats gained contr ol of the House. The new Speaker of the House of Representative was John Nan ce Garner ( Footnote 21 ) of Texas. Miller was a Garner ally, and in Miller’s view, the main qualification for the Democratic nominee to replace Wurchbach was electab ility. And no one was more popular in the 14th District than a member of the K leberg family. 46 After easily winning the election, Kleberg gave Mil ler, the lobbyist, carte blanche permission to use his Capitol Hill office as if it were his own. Often Kleberg never went to the office at all. In essence, Miller was t he unelected congressman for the 14 th District and Kleberg was merely a figurehead; 47 however, the work of the Kleberg’s constituency was left to his legislative assistant, Lyndon Johnson. 48 Under Miller’s tutelage, Johnson learned to play ha rdball politics. When Kleberg’s bid for re-election was challenged in the 1932 Demo cratic primary by a more liberal candidate, Carl Wright Johnson; Lyndon Johnson, Roy Miller and another Texas politician, Welly Hopkins, maligned the challenger’ s character, calling him a \"communist,\" guilty of \"radicalism\" and \"similar fi lth and slime.\" 49 Carl Johnson didn’t have a chance in a district so thoroughly co ntrolled by the King Ranch. Newspapers gave him limited coverage. 50 Needless to say, the challenger lost. 51 Ironically, Kleberg won ten of eleven counties in h is district; but the one he lost was Lyndon Johnson’s home county of Blanco. Some reside nts of the county felt that"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" 174 Kleberg lost in Blanco because many of the voters d isliked the congressman’s legislative assistant. According to Johnson’s aid, Gene Latimer, \"He worked hard—he just broke his back—to get those people to like him , but they just didn’t.\" 52 Johnson’s Mentor, Senator Alvin Jacob Wirtz Alvin Jacob Wirtz was a lawyer and legislator, firs t a state senator from Texas, then a United States Senator for the same state. In 1935, Wirtz came to Washington and helped organize the Lower Colorado River Authority. He specialized in oil and water law and was appointed general counsel to the newly established LCRA. Working closely with United States Representative Lyndon Jo hnson, he helped the river authority secure grants and loans from the Public W orks Administration, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and the Rural E lectrification Administration. 53 More than any one person, Alvin Wirtz helped pave L yndon Johnson’s early rise to power. Ed Clark, a colleague of Wirtz’ for years sa id of him, \"What he wanted was P- O-W-E-R—power over other men. He wanted power, but he didn’t want to get it by running for office. He liked to sit quietly, smoke a cigar. He would sit and work in his library, and plan and scheme, and usually he would get somebody out in front of him so that nobody knew it was Alvin Wirtz who was doin g it. He would sit and scheme in the dark. He wasn’t an outgoing person. But he w as the kind of person who didn’t want to lose any fights. And he didn’t lose many.\" 54 As an attorney, Wirtz had a reputation among colleg ues for being ruthless. A San Antonio attorney observed that he was \"a conniver—a conniver like I never saw before or since. Sharp, cunning.\" Another attorney commented that \"He would gut you if he could. But you would probably never know he did it. I mean, that was a man who would do anything—and he would still be smiling when he slipped you the knife.\" 55 In 1917 Wirtz moved his family to Seguin, where he continued his law practice until 1934. From 1922 to 1930 Wirtz served as state senat or from Guadalupe County. During his time in the legislature, Wirtz became in volved with a group of citizens interested in the development of the Guadalupe Rive r as a source of hydroelectric power. 56 As someone driven by a need to obtain power over m en, Wirtz viewed dams as a means of acquiring it. 57 In 1934 Wirtz moved to Austin after being run out o f Seguin by disgruntled farmers who believed his dam projects had cheated them out of their land. This was result of his dealings with businessman Samuel Insull of Chic ago. Insull had retained Wirtz to procure land from farmers along the Guadalupe River for the purpose of building six small dams for irrigation. The farmers were unwilli ng to sell, but through legal maneuvering, Wirtz got the government to purchase t he farmers’ land at low prices. On February 26, 1934, Tom Hollamon, Sr—a sixty-seve n-year-old farmer and former Texas Ranger—walked into Wirtz’s office, where he w as meeting with Insull representatives, and began shooting. Before being d isarmed, one Chicago financier was dead. Hollamon was arrested for murder, but Wir tz was quickly run out of town by the locals. 58 "},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" 175 In Austin Wirtz organized the law firm of Powell, W irtz, Rauhut, and Gideon. Things seemed bleak for awhile, but Roosevelt’s New Deal g ave him a chance to revive his dream of becoming a power mogul. During Roosevelt’s \"Hundred Days\" portion of the New Deal, $3.3 billion of federal money was slo wly released into the economy for public works which included dams. Eventually a $10, 000,000 dam project, the Marshall Ford Dam, became the vehicle by which Wirt z could acquire the power he sought. The contract was awarded to one of Wirtz’ c lients, Brown & Root. 59 Brown & Root: Johnson’s Primary Financial Supporter Throughout Lyndon Johnson’s career, Brown & Root wa s his biggest financial supporter. Today the company is a huge defense cont ractor. It was founded by Herman Brown in the 1920s. The son of a Belton, Tex as shopkeeper, Herman’s career had a humble beginning. But Alvin Wirtz and Lyndon Johnson helped Brown & Root acquire huge defense contracts from President Roose velt in the late 1930s. The company prospered a great deal after America’s entr y into World War II. Brown & Root returned the favor by giving Johnson virtually any financial help he requested. Brown & Root continued to grow as the primary contr actor for building military bases. When Johnson got America into the Vietnam War, Brow n & Root made a fortune constructing military bases in Southeast Asia. They built the Tan Son Nhut Air Base and reportedly built many of the infamous tiger cag es used to brutalize and torture suspected enemies of the Saigon regime. 60 Tiger Cages were cells constructed below ground with just enough room to fit one person. Pri soners were put in these as punishment for various infractions of the rules. As of this writing (2002) Brown & Root is owned by the Halliburton Company, a prestigious defense contractor based in Dallas, Tex as. Until July 25, 2000, Vice- President Dick Cheney was CEO and chairman of the b oard of the Halliburton Company.

(Yahoo, ticker: HAL, profile, December 2001) The Rags to Riches Story of Brown & Root At the age of sixteen (1909), Herman Brown got a jo b earning two dollars a day carrying a rod to assist surveyors. For ten years, he lived in a crowded tent for members of the construction crew. In fact, when he got married in 1917, he and his wife, Margaret Root, spent their wedding night in a tent, and a tent was their first home. 61 At the age of twenty-one, Herman became a contracto r. At that time, successful contractors had to know how to handle mules and men . Herman quickly gained a reputation for getting the maximum amount of work f rom men working on construction contracts. Later, he took on two partn ers. As a favor to his wife, Margaret Root, Herman made her brother, Dan Root, a partner; along with Herman’s brother George. When Dan Root died, the firm’s name remained unchanged out of affection to Herman’s wife. 62 After the success of the Marshall Ford Dam, Herman Brown was looking for even bigger projects for his construction company. Somet hing big was about to happen. In 1938, Congress, at President Roosevelt’s request, h ad authorized the expenditure of a billion dollars on a \"two-ocean\" Navy. By early 193 9 it had become clear that a substantial portion of that billion would be spent on the construction of naval bases and training stations for a greatly expanded Navy A ir Force. On April 26, 1939, Roosevelt had signed into law a bill authorizing th e expenditure of $66,800,000 for the first of such bases. Brown’s attention was alre ady focused on the Navy because Lyndon Johnson was a member of the Naval Affairs Co mmittee. He decided to bid on one of the bases—in San Juan, Puerto Rico—authorize d in the April bill. Unfortunately, Johnson did not have enough influenc e within the White House, and Brown was not awarded the San Juan contract. 63 An important political dynamic had developed betwee n President Roosevelt and his Texan Vice-President John Garner. In 1937 the conse rvative Garner broke with liberal Roosevelt over the latter's plan to enlarge the Sup reme Court. In 1940 Garner challenged Roosevelt for the Democratic presidentia l nomination but lost. 64 "},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":" 177 Meanwhile, there was talk of another naval air base for Texas, on the Gulf of Corpus Christi. Obviously Brown wanted that contract, but he had been a Garner supporter for years. So had Corpus Christi’s Congressman, Ric hard Kleberg. In fact, Kleberg’s primary handler, Roy Miller, was Garner’s campaign manager. Lyndon Johnson too, had long supported Garner. All parties knew that in order to get the Corpus Christi contract, they would have to unilaterally endorse R oosevelt over Garner. The Texans chose to drop Garner by sending a subtle political signal to Roosevelt rather than overtly pledging their support to him. 65 In the midst of this turmoil, George Brown wrote a letter to Johnson pledging his support: In the past I have not been very timid about asking you to do favors for me and hope you will not get any timidit y if you have anything at all that you think I can or should do. Remember that I am for you, right or wrong, and it makes no differe nce if I think you are right or wrong. If you want it, I am for it 100%. 66 In Houston, where Brown & Root’s headquarters were located, Herman Brown’s political influence was growing, and the city’s Con gressman, Albert Thomas, a junior Representative with negligible clout in Washington, was known to take Herman’s orders unquestionably. In August, Congressman Thoma s had said, \"Of course every member of the Texas delegation is for Vice Presiden t Garner.\" In December 1939, Thomas made another statement. He was not for Garne r after all, he said. He was for Roosevelt. 67 This was a signal to Roosevelt, sent by Johnson et al, that they had dumped their longtime political ally, John Garner. Roosevelt responded positively with two reciprocal signals. First, on January 2, 1940, he appointed Alvin J. Wirtz as Under Secretary of t he Interior. Wirtz was the attorney for Brown & Root and had been recommended by Lyndon Johnson. Wirtz would be second in command only to Harold Ickes. Second, the White House went out of its way to cite Representative Lyndon Johnson as the pe rson who \"presented Wirtz’s name.\" Presidential Secretary Stephen Early stated that \"neither Texas Senator was consulted,\" nor was Speaker of the House Sam Raybur n or Secretary of Commerce Jesse Jones. To readers of political signals, it wa s clear that Lyndon Johnson had become a key White House ally. 68 In addition, the Navy Department was quietly inform ed by the White House that Lyndon Johnson was to be consulted—and advice taken —on the awarding of Navy contracts in Texas. 69 Consequently, Brown & Root began obtaining coveted Navy Department contracts. The Corpus Christi Naval Air Station was awarded to Brown & Root without competitive bidding. Instead it was awarded on a \"n egotiated basis.\" Because the contract was so big, Brown & Root was directed by t he Roosevelt administration to share the profits with another contractor, Kaiser. 70 "},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":" 178 Friendship With J. Edgar Hoover It has been well documented that Hoover and Johnson had been friends since 1945 when a young Senator Johnson and his family moved o nto the same block of Washington’s Thirtieth Place where Hoover lived. 71 John Edgar Hoover (1895 - 1972) was born in Washing ton, DC—the youngest of four children—and rarely left the city his entire life. He lived with his mother at 413 Seward Square until her death in 1938. Afterward he continued living there with his companion and associate director at the FBI, Clyde Tolson. 72 It is common knowledge that the two were homosexual lovers . In 1917, Hoover entered the Department of Justice a s a file reviewer. Within two years he became special assistant to Attorney Gener al A. Mitchell Palmer in the Woodrow Wilson administration. In that position, he oversaw the mass roundups and deportations of suspected Bolsheviks (Communists) a fter World War I. In May of 1924, he was named acting director of the Bureau of Investigation (as it was then called) and confirmed as director seven months late r. Finding the Bureau in disarray because of the scandals of the Harding administrati on, he reorganized and rebuilt it, establishing a fingerprint file, which became the w orld's largest; a scientific crime- detection laboratory; and the FBI National Academy, to which selected law enforcement officers from all parts of the country were sent for special training. 73 By the early 1930s, the Bureau was involved in the pursuit of Bonnie and Clyde and the Ma Barker Gang, the shooting and killing of not orious bank robber John Dillinger, investigating the kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh’s infant son, and countless other sensational stories. 74 In the summer of 1936, Hoover began to have secret meetings with President Roosevelt where the FBI was granted executive autho rity to expand into intelligence gathering—particularly in areas of subversive activ ities in America, including Communism and fascism. With Roosevelt’s support, th e FBI grew from 391 agents in 1933 to nearly 5,000 by the end of World War II. 75 After war, the Hoover exploited anticommunist hyste ria of the Cold War to intensify the FBI’s intelligence activities. It is widely kno wn that Hoover leaked derogatory material on Martin Luther King in the 1960s as part of his secret counterintelligence (COINTELPRO) program. Former assistant FBI Director William Sullivan commented on Hoover’s surveillance of Kennedy and K ing in a book, The Bureau , published posthumously in 1979. ( Footnote 22 ) The following is an excerpt from that book: Hoover was always gathering damaging material on Ja ck Kennedy, which the President, with his active socia l life, seemed more than willing to provide. We never put any tech nical surveillance on JFK, but whatever came up was autom atically funneled directly to Hoover. I was sure he was savi ng everything he had on Kennedy, and on Martin Luther King, Jr., too, until he could unload it all and destroy them both. He kept this kind of explosive material in his personal files, which fil led four rooms on"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" 179 the fifth floor of headquarters. (William Sullivan, The Bureau , p. 50 76 ) Hoover’s view of organized crime was astonishing, t o say the least. As late as January 1962, Hoover denied its existence in the United Sta tes. He stated that \"No single individual or coalition of racketeers dominates org anized crime across the nation.\" It was not until gangster Joe Valachi was brought to W ashington by Attorney General Robert Kennedy’s Justice Department to testify befo re the Senate that Hoover was forced to admit that his opinion about organized cr ime in American needed some serious re-thinking. 77 In January 1964, shortly after Hoover’s 69 th birthday (Jan. 1 st ) and less than two months after Kennedy’s assassination, President Joh nson signed an Executive Order exempting Hoover from retiring on his 70 th birthday, which was mandatory at that time. It should be noted that Johnson was also gear ing up the Warren Commission to investigate Kennedy’s death in that timeframe. Cons equently, it is not implausible to think that Johnson’s Executive Order may have been an incentive to Hoover not to conduct a serious investigation of the assassinatio n. It might have been a reward as well, since many of the FBI’s cover-up activities h ad already been accomplished by January. 78 Sullivan also observed that the relationship betwee n Johnson and Hoover changed after Johnson assumed the presidency. The following is an excerpt from Sullivan’s posthumous book, The Bureau : They remained close when Johnson served as Vice Pre sident, but there was a change in their relationship when J ohnson became President. The Director was over 65 by that time, past retirement age for federal employees, and he stayed in office only because of a special waiver which required the Pres ident’s signature each year. That waiver put Hoover right i n Johnson’s pocket. With that leverage, Johnson began to take a dvantage of Hoover, using the Bureau as his personal investigat ive arm. His never-ending requests were usually political, and s ometimes illegal... And Hoover hot-footed it to Johnson’s dema nds... he found himself very much in the back seat, almost a captive of the President ... (William Sullivan, The Bureau , pp. 60 - 61 79 ) Endnotes 1.

Washing ton advised citizens of the new republic to renounce any \"passionate attachment\" ( Footnote 23 ) with another nation, and also to repudiate \"inveterate hatred\" toward anothe r country. In the Twentieth Century, the United States failed to heed Washington’s warni ngs on both counts. Shortly after World War II, we developed an \"inveterate hatred\" o f the Soviet Union and formed a \"passionate attachment\" to Israel, although the lat ter accelerated dramatically under the Johnson Administration. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was the last America n president in the Twentieth Century to successfully stand up to the pressures a nd unyielding annoyances of the Israeli government and its American supporters. Alt hough President Kennedy shared his predecessor’s views intellectually, he entered the White House after an extremely close election. Consequently, he had to assume a mo re cautious approach. The Eisenhower administration’s Middle East policy is important for two reasons. First of all, it demonstrated that a strong America n president can stand up to Israel. Secondly, it reveals that Lyndon Johnson—then Senate Majority Leader—was Eisenhower’s most influential political adversary r egarding Israel. Two major incidents occurred on Eisenhower’s watch where Israel acted as an aggressor toward its neighbors and toward Palestini ans living in the region. The first incident occurred in 1953 and involved Israel’s eff ort to secretly divert waters of the Jordan. The second incident occurred in 1957 when I srael conspired with France and Britain to attack Egypt and overthrow that country’ s leader, President Gamal Abdel Nasser, after he nationalized the Suez Canal in def iance of Israel and the Western powers. In the latter incident, Lyndon Johnson used all of his political muscle as Senate Majority Leader to prevent the UN from impos ing sanctions on Israel—the sanctions were fully supported by the Eisenhower ad ministration—for its flagrant disregard for international law. In both instances, Eisenhower forced Israel to behave by temporarily cutting off American aid. 1953: The Jordan River Diversion Israel secretly planned to use the Palestinian vill age of Banat Ya’qub for a major water diversion project that would move waters of t he Jordan Valley to central Israel and the North Negev. The UN, the US, and the Palest inians who lived in that area were unaware of Israel’s plans. Earlier, the Eisenh ower administration had offered to implement an American-sponsored regional water-usag e plan, and Israel had promised to cooperate in that effort. But in realit y, Israel secretly wanted complete control of the flow of water in the region, despite its commitments to the Americans. Consequently, a dispute ensued over the control of Palestinian territory near Banat Ya’qub."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":" 183 Unaware of Israel’s hidden agenda, UN Representativ e, Dr. Ralph Bunche, worked out a truce agreement where disputed lands would be evacuated by Syrian forces. The agreement stipulated that Israel must allow Arab in habitants to continue farming there. Israel also agreed that it would not occupy the dis puted area, but would allow it to be a neutral zone. Immediately after the Syrian troops withdrew, the I sraelis broke their promise and drove the Palestinian farmers from the land. The Sy rian troops responded by opening fire to drive out the settlers. Israel responded by complaining that the Syrians had violated the truce and asserted a right to occupy t he areas. UN Truce Observers immediately cited Israel as the instigator and esse ntially stated that the Syrian troops were justified in retaliating against Israel for vi olating the truce agreement. The Israelis took the strategy that if they complet ed the water diversion project at Banat Ya’qub, then the UN would back down because t he work simply could not be undone. So the Israelis began working aggressively on the project. They worked non- stop, twenty-four hours a day using searchlights at night to hasten completion. But secrecy was still key. They omitted appropriations for the project from their published budget. In addition, they did not mention it to Ame ricans working with them on other water projects; however, US intelligence soon detec ted their activity. President Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Fo ster Dulles realized that Israel had openly deceived them and had no intention of ke eping its earlier promise to cooperate in the American-sponsored regional water- usage plan. To show its displeasure, the Eisenhower administration withheld $26 million under the Mutual Security Act and suspended economic aid until Israe l agreed to cooperate with UN observers. In addition, President Eisenhower direct ed the Treasury to prepare an Executive Order removing tax-deductible status from contributions by Jewish Americans to such Zionist organizations as the Unit ed Jewish Appeal (UJA). Eisenhower did not make these actions public becaus e he did not want to humiliate the Israelis; however, the Israelis interpreted his magnanimous gesture as a sign of weakness. As a result, they continued work on the p roject—convinced that the Americans would back down. Israel’s strategy might have worked had Israel not launched a bloody raid on the village of Kibya on the night of October 14, 1953. In that attack, twenty-five-year-old Ariel Sharon and his three hundred Israeli commando s, known as Force 101, massacred fifty-three Palestinian civilians. Accord ing to a UN report, Sharon’s forces drove the villagers into their homes then blew them up. The Eisenhower administration condemned the raid an d, for the first time, publicly revealed that it had already suspended construction funds for Israel’s water supply. Their was a huge backlash against Eisenhower. The U S government was denounced by Hadassah, a Jewish charitable organization. An a ttaché at the Israeli Embassy attempted to divert attention from the water contro versy by claiming—in a widely publicized speech—that the Kibya raid was in respon se to Jordanian aggression. Pro- Israeli congressmen and David Ben-Gurion accused Ei senhower and his advisers of anti-Semitism."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" 184 But Eisenhower stood firm and continued to withhold funds from Israel. Fearing a financial burden, Israeli representatives informed President Eisenhower—on October 19—that work had ceased on the water diversion proj ect and that Israel would cooperate with the Security Counsil’s efforts to so lve the Jordan River Development problem. Within twenty-four hours, America restored aid to Israel. Eisenhower demonstrated that Israel responded faste r to cutting off the money flow than anything else; however, the Israelis interpret ed America’s quick restoration of aid as proof that they could manipulate the superpo wer by applying adequate pressure. Ultimately, Israel completed the project in a sligh tly altered manner. 1 Nov. 1956: The Suez Crisis The stage was set for the Suez Crisis in 1955 when the Eisenhower administration began pressuring Israel to demonstrate its commitme nt to peace in the Middle East. On February 28, 1955, President Gamal Adbel Nasser made a speech full of warnings against Israeli atrocities. He emphasized a bloody raid on the Gaza Strip by the Israelis, allegedly a retaliation for raids made fr om Gaza. Nasser was also upset with the United States for denying his request for arms a few months earlier. In his speech he repeated the request for Egypt to buy arms but w as ignored. On September 4, 1955, Egypt announced that it had r eceived a proposal from the Soviet Union for an arms sale. The Eisenhower admin istration treated this as an idle threat which angered Nasser. As a result, he broker ed a cotton-for-arms barter agreement with Czechoslovakia on September 27 in wh ich Egypt received $200 million worth of arms—tanks, MiG planes, artillery, submarines, and small arms. Israel immediately renewed its joint arms agreement with the United States, France, and Britain. In addition, Israel requested a treaty guaranteeing its security, but it was denied by the Western powers because they knew that Israel’s military strength was vastly superior to the neighboring Arab nations. On August 26, 1955, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles made a speech before the Council of Foreign Relations in New York in which h e outlined terms for peace in the Middle East. He stated that the problem of Palestin ian refugees could be solved, but Israel should not be expected to assume the full co st. He proposed that Congress approve an international loan to finance the resett lement or repatriating of Palestinian refugees. The loan would also help develop irrigati on projects to assist refugees in cultivating their land for growing crops. The Israelis were somewhat agitated by Dulles’s spe ech because he mentioned a possible boundary revision. Dulles promptly respond ed to clarify the American position. He stated in no uncertain terms that if S harett and Ben-Gurion (Israeli leaders) wanted American diplomatic, political, and military aid, they would have to demonstrate their peaceful intentions by helping re solve the sensitive problems of Palestinian refugees and boundary disputes. On Nove mber 9, President Eisenhower—"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" 185 who was in a Denver hospital convalescing from a he art attack—confirmed Dulles’s position in a formal statement made from his hospit al bed. 2 At that point, it became clear that the United Stat es could no longer be counted on to support Israel’s continuing efforts to expand its b orders. Consequently, Israel turned to the European powers for support. Over the next y ear, trouble began to arise over the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal is a sea-level waterway running nort h-south across the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt to connect the Mediterranean and the Red seas. The canal separates the African continent from Asia, and it provides the sh ortest seagoing route between Europe and the lands lying around the Indian and we stern Pacific oceans. It is one of the world's most heavily used shipping lanes. 3 On July 26, 1956, Egyptian President Nasser angered Israel and the European powers when he nationalized the Suez Canal. He took this b old action because he felt that friends of Israel in America had cheated him out of US aide for the Aswan Dam that Egypt needed for irrigation and power. The dam cost $1.3 billion and Nasser had been given the impression by the Eisenhower administrati on that US aide would be forthcoming; however, friends of Israel in America pressured the Senate Appropriations Committee into blocking funding for the dam. On July 16, 1956, funding was officially denied—much to the chagrin of President Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. To make matt ers worse, the State Department issued a statement, on July 19, critically appraisi ng Egypt’s international credit. Nasser felt that this was a ruse created by friends of Israel in America, and he responded by seizing control of the canal and natio nalizing the Suez Canal Company in order to obtain funds for the dam. 4 On October 29, 1956, Israel attacked Egypt and adva nced toward the Suez Canal. On November 1, British and French forces also invaded Egypt and began occupation of the canal zone, but growing opposition from Preside nt Eisenhower, Secretary of State Dulles, UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld, and Soviet threats of intervention put an immediate stop to British and French support , but Israeli troops still occupied the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gaza Strip in defiance of a UN resolution. 5 Eisenhower was so angered by European involvement in the attac k that he telephoned British Prime Minister Anthony Eden and gave him such a ton gue-lashing that the Prime Minister was reduced to tears. 6 ( Footnote 24 ) Eisenhower told Dulles: \"Foster, you tell’em, godda mn it, we’re going to apply sanctions, we’re going to the United Nations, we’re going to do everything that there is to stop this thing.\" He later explained, \"We jus t told the Israelis it was absolutely indefensible and that if they expect our support in the Middle East and in maintaining their position, they had better behave... We went to town right away to give them hell.\" UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld shared Eisenh ower’s view that Israel needed to learn to behave. Consequently, Hammarskjö ld and Ben-Gurion engaged in some heated exchanges after the UN Secretary Genera l publicly condemned Israel for its retaliatory actions against Palestinians. In 19 56 Ben-Gurion complained that"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" 186 Hammarskjöld’s remarks had encouraged assaults on I srael by Egypt and Jordan. Hammarskjöld replied as follows: You are convinced that the threat of retaliation ha s a deterrent effect.

You are convinced that acts of retaliation will stop further incidents. I am convinced that th ey will lead to further incidents....You believe that this way of cre ating respect for Israel will pave the way for sound coexistence with the Arab people. I believe that the policy may postpone inde finitely the time for such coexistence.... I think the discussion of this question can be considered closed since you, in spi te of previous discouraging experiences, have taken the responsibi lity of large- scale tests of the correctness of your belief. 7 On February 2, 1957, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution demanding Israel’s withdrawal from the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gaza Strip, but Ben-Gurion refused. Fed up with Israel’s treachery, Eisenhower wrote a strong letter to Ben- Gurion demanding Israel’s withdrawal. Still Ben-Gur ion refused. 8 Feb. 1957: LBJ Rescued Israel From UN Sanctions It had been rumored that UN Secretary-General Dag H ammarskjöld of Sweden was quietly pushing for sanctions—with the full support of the Eisenhower administration—against Israel if it continued to ma intain troops in the Gulf of Aqaba and Gaza in defiance of US and UN demands for immed iate withdrawal. In response, Lyndon Johnson—then Senate Majority Leader—wrote a letter to Secretary of State John Foster Dulles urging the Eisenhower Administra tion not to support UN sanctions against Israel. Johnson’s letter to Dulles appeared in the New York Times on February 20, 1957. The Senate Majority Leader’s arg ument was that it was an unfair double-standard to punish a small country like Isra el when large countries like the Soviet Union were allowed to openly defy UN resolut ions without being punished. 9 In addition, Johnson rallied Senate Democrats to op pose Israel sanctions. ( Footnote 25 ) He used partisan politics to pressure Eisenhower into retreating from principle, but Eisenhower stood his ground and kept applying press ure to Israel by cutting off or delaying financial assistance. When Israel began to run out of money, in March 1957, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion finally agreed to w ithdraw troops from the occupied territories. President Eisenhower triumphe d, but Johnson had protected Israel from the humiliation of UN sanctions. Sadly, Eisenhower was the last US president to stand up to the Israeli government and it’s American supporters. At least he proved it could be done. 10 Ironically, one of the best accounts of Lyndon John son’s involvement in the Suez Crisis was written by Louis Bloomfield in his 1957 book entitled Egypt, Israel and the Gulf of Aqaba . In the ensuing years, Johnson’s involvement in th at conflict has"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" 187 been erased from history. Although his pro-Israel s tance appeared on the front page of the New York Times on February 20, 1957, his name i s not mentioned in Western history books about the Suez Crisis (none that I ha ve found anyway, except Bloomfield’s). The power elite within the book publ ishing industry have apparently been concealing Johnson’s loyalty to Israel as a me ans of preventing inquiries by historians, researchers, and investigators about a possible Jewish conspiracy behind the assassination of President Kennedy years later. This is how Bloomfield described Johnson’s pro-Isra el stance during the Suez/Gulf of Aqaba Crisis: On February 11th, 1957, Mr. John Foster Dulles, Uni ted States Secretary of State, submitted certain Proposals to the Israeli Government which were, in effect, that: \"Israel should withdraw her troops from the Gulf of Aqaba region and the Gaza Strip, in accordance with the recommen dations of the United Nations General Assembly. The United States should use all its influence to e stablish the Strait of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba as an interna tional waterway for the innocent passage of all nations, including Israel. Meanwhile the United States should do everything it could to see that United Nations troops replaced the Israeli tro ops in the Gaza Strip and that that area should become a kind of de facto United Nations trusteeship where United Nations officials would watch and if possible stop any fighting between Israel an d Egypt.\" Subsequent discussion between the United States Sec retary of State and Mr. Abba Eban did not bring about the wit hdrawal of the Israeli forces from these two areas and rumours began to circulate in the American press that the Afro-Asian bloc would introduce resolutions calling for economic and mili tary sanctions to force Israel to comply with the withdrawal resol utions. On February 19th, 1957, Senator Lyndon B. Johnson, the Senate Majority Leader, wrote to Mr. John Foster Dulles ur ging that the United States oppose imposing of economic sanctions against Israel by the United Nations. The letter was endors ed by the Senate Democratic Policy Committee.

Kennedy—then a US Senator— made a speech, \"Facing Facts on Algeria,\" which denounced France’s colonia l occupation of Algeria and the brutality of the French-Algerian War. The speech al so demonstrated an understanding of Indochina that would likely have prevented him f rom escalating US military involvement in Vietnam had he not been killed. Historian Richard Mahoney summarized the speech and events that preceded and followed it: Early in 1957, Kennedy decided to make a major crit ique of the [Eisenhower] administration’s position on France’s colonial war in Algeria. By 1957, the French had committed over 500 ,000 troops to the effort to suppress the nationalist rebellion . Torture, atrocity, and terror on both sides had turned the pride of Fr ance’s empire into a chamber of horrors. ...the Eisenhower administ ration had been maintaining a policy of strict silence in Alge ria – at least until Kennedy’s attack, which The New York Times ca lled \"the most comprehensive and outspoken arraignment of Wes tern policy toward Algeria yet presented by an American in public office.\" On July 2, 1957, Kennedy accused the Eisenhower administration of courting disaster in Algeria. He charged that Eisenhower’s policy of non-involvement in Africa an d Asia was really made up of \"tepid encouragement and moraliza tions to both sides, cautious neutrality on all the real iss ues, and a restatement of our obvious dependence upon our Euro pean friends, and our obvious dedication nevertheless to the principles of self-determination, and our obvious desire not t o become involved.\" The result, Kennedy said, was that, \"We have deceived ourselves into believing that we have thus pleased both sides and displeased no one ... when, in truth, we have ear ned the suspicion of all.\" The previous decade had proven that the tide of nat ionalism in the Third World – from Indochina to India to Indone sia – was \"irresistible,\" Kennedy declared. It was time for F rance to face the fact that Algeria had to be freed. When would the W est learn, he asked, that colonies \"are like fruit that cling to the tree only till they ripen?\" Didn’t the French debacle in Indochina , which ended at Dien Bien Phu, serve as a warning of what lay ah ead for France in Algeria if something were not done? [Referring to lessons that should have been learned from France’s Indochina debacle, Kennedy stated,] \"Did that tragic episode not teach us whether Franc e likes it or not, admits it or not, or has our support or not, t hat their overseas territories are sooner or later, one by one, going to break free and"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" 189 look with suspicion on the Western nations who impe ded their steps to independence? ... Nationalism in Africa cann ot be evaluated purely in terms of the historical and leg al niceties argued by the French and thus far accepted by the S tate Department.

Most prominent Democrats were equally scornful. Adlai St evenson dismissed Kennedy’s speech as \"terrible.\" Dean Ache son described the speech as \"foolish words that wound ... a dispirited ally.\" In France, the speech provoked an even more furious outcry. Paris’s largest daily, \"Le Figaro,\" remarked: \"It i s shameful that our business is so badly directed that we are force d to endure such idiocies.\" U.S. News and World Report noted th at \"An American has unified France – against himself!\" Res ponding to Kennedy’s speech, French President Rene Coty told t he French Senate that France would \"never negotiate with cutt hroats since independence would give the 1,200,000 Europeans liv ing in Algeria one alternative – leaving their homeland or living at the mercy of fanaticism.\" French Defense Minister Andre Morice publicly wondered whether Kennedy was \"having night mares.\" Talk of independence, Morice said, \"will cost many more innocent lives,\" Harvard historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr . reported to Kennedy from Paris that summer that \"Algeria is beg inning to poison France.\" In Algeria itself, feeling among the European colon ists against the speech ran so high that French authorities warned A merican newsmen and residents to stay off the streets to av oid reprisals. Two days after the speech a bomb exploded outside t he American consulate in Algiers. The French Resident Minister in Algiers, Robert Lacoste, called the bomb \"a Communi st joke\" and challenged Kennedy to come to Algeria. The senator declined. ...Practically no one in the American foreign-policy establishment regarded the Algeria speech as anything more than a partisan political blast designed to attract attention.

In a lette r to the editor of The New York Times, Pierre wrote: \"Strangely eno ugh, as a Frenchman I feel that on the whole Mr. Kennedy is m ore to be commended than blamed for his forthright, frank and provocative speech.\" Although Le Monde opposed Kennedy’s call for Algeri an independence, it identified the senator as one of t he few serious students of history in American politics: \"The most striking point of the speech of Mr. Kennedy is the important docum entation it revealed and his thorough knowledge of the French m ilieu.\" (Richard Mahoney, JFK: Ordeal in Africa , pp. 19-22) Kennedy, Eisenhower, and Algeria In his 1957 speech about Algeria, \"Senator\" Kennedy was highly critical of the Eisenhower administration; however, the political d ynamic involved must be considered. Kennedy’s views about Israel and the Mi ddle East in general were closer to Eisenhower’s than Johnson’s. Having stated that, it is significant to understand that Kennedy’s public endorsement of an independent Alge ria was a subtle criticism of Israel. It is widely known that Israel opposed Alge ria’s independence because it (Israel) wanted to oppress or dominate all Muslim/A rab states. Although Eisenhower had not publicly supported Algerian independence, i t seems plausible that he may have agreed with Kennedy but lacked the political c ourage to denounce France as the young Senator had boldly done in his speech. Upon r eflection, Eisenhower may have secretly admired Kennedy for publicly denouncing Am erica’s World War II ally. After all, France had recently betrayed Eisenhower by secretly conniving with Israel and Britain to attack Egypt after President Nasser had nationalized the Suez Canal. ( Footnote 26 ) Kennedy surely understood how much he and Eisenhowe r agreed on Middle Eastern issues, but Eisenhower belonged to the opposing pol itical party; and Kennedy and Johnson both had their eyes on the White House in t he upcoming 1960 presidential campaign. Consequently, one of Kennedy’s objectives when making the Algerian speech was likely to differentiate himself from the sitting Republican President and his Democratic adversary, Johnson. Although Kennedy and Johnson held opposing views about Israel, they could not openly criticize each other because they were both Democrats. But since Eisenhower was a Republican, i t made sense politically for a Democratic Senator to criticize him for not support ing Algerian independence. The speech also sent a message to informed political ob servers that unlike Johnson, Kennedy would not be a minion for Israel if elected president. Even more important, Kennedy’s Algerian speech made the front page of the New York Times which put him in the same league as Sena te Majority Leader Johnson.

Jun. 5, 1967: The Six Day War Ten years after the Suez Crisis, Israel attacked Eg ypt again; but this time with success. The event is known as the Six Day War which began o n June 5, 1967. Things had changed a great deal over the ten years leading up to the Six Day War. Israel’s most influential adversaries had either died or left pub lic office. Eisenhower had retired years earlier and was in failing health. John Foste r Dulles had died of cancer in 1959. Dag Hammarskjöld had been killed in a mysterious pl ane crash in the Congolese province of Katanga in 1961. President Kennedy of c ourse had been assassinated in Dallas in 1963. And Israel’s old ally, Lyndon Johns on, had become Commander-in- Chief of the United States. In July of 1965, Presid ent Johnson had appointed Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg as US ambassador to t he UN. Goldberg—a Jew and ardent supporter of Israel—replaced Adlai Stevenson as US delegate to the UN after Stevenson died suddenly of a heart attack on July 1 4, 1965. ( Footnote 27 ) The Yemen War had been eroding Arab unity since the conflict bega n in 1962. ( Footnote 28 ) By 1967, Egyptian forces had suffered heavy losses and were weakened after five years of military involvement in the Yemen War. Whether these events were random or planned is anyo ne’s guess, but they were definitely advantageous to Israel by the time the S ix Day War occurred in 1967. The Six Day War was a watershed event that transfor med Israel from a small nation into a colonial empire. Although Israel became a na tion in 1948, it expanded dramatically after the Six Day War. Israel took fro m the Arabs—through military force—the Old City of Jerusalem, the Sinai and the Gaza Strip, the Jordanian territory west of the Jordan River known as the West Bank, an d the Golan Heights, on the Israeli-Syrian border. 11 In addition to acquiring new land, Israel gained c ontrol of an additional 900,000 Arabs who became the discontente d subjects of the new Israeli empire. Since 1967, the number of Arabs under Israe l’s military control has grown to over 1.75 million. 12 Amnesty International has documented Israel’s inhum ane treatment of its Palestinian subjects citing arbitrary arrests, torturing detain ees, destroying or sealing the homes of Arab suspects and their relatives, confiscating lan d, destroying crops, and diverting precious water from thirsty Palestinians in the des ert to fill the swimming pools and water the lawns of Israeli settlers. 13 This conduct is condoned, embraced, and encouraged by the United States through its steadfa st financial and military support of Israel. Today, US tax payers spend approximately $3 billion annually to subsidize, support, and arm Israel. Although Israel is a wealt hy country by western standards, it receives the highest amount of American foreign aid money, 28 percent. 14 Jewish scholars Michael Kazin and Maurice Isserman described in their book, America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s , the passion ignited within American Jews by the Six Day War. They wrote the following:"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" 192 The swift, complete victory was followed by a long and wrenching occupation of Palestinian lands. For many American Jews, the 1967 conflict awakened and inspired passions that d id much to transform the meaning of their identity. No longer was Israel just a reason for Jewish pride, a desert miracle of oran ge groves and thriving kibbutzes, whose creation was romanticized in Exodus-a popular novel and film of the late '50s and early ' 60s. Israel was now the homeland of fellow Jews who had fought alon e for their survival and were resigned to living in perpetual d anger. The threat came not just from Arab militants but from c ommunist powers, their Third World allies, and a good many A merican leftists who were eager to prove their \"anti-imperi alist\" credentials. In the face of extinction, Israel beca me \"the ultimate reality in the life of every Jew living today,\" as a young professor at Brandeis University put it, \"In dealing with tho se who oppose Israel, we are not reasonable and we are not ration al. Nor should we be.\" 15 Those are troubling words, but they reflect the tru e agenda of those who support the Jewish state of Israel. Background on the Six Day War Understanding the Six Day War requires some backgro und regarding the politics of the Middle East in 1967. The following men were hea ds of state for the countries involved in the Six Day War: Nation Head of State Egypt President Gamal Abdel Nasser Sryia General Salah al-Jadid Jordan King Hussein [ibn Talal] Israel Prime Minister Levi Eshkol US President Lyndon Baines Johnson USSR Chairman Aleksey Nikolayevich Kosygin UN Secretary General U Thant (of Burma, now Myanmar ) Egyptian President Nasser was a key figure in Middl e Eastern affairs for seventeen years. In 1954 he became prime minister of Egypt, a nd in 1956 he became that country’s president—remaining in that position unti l his sudden death in 1970. 16 Nasser had been Israel’s primary enemy because he w as a charismatic Muslim leader who advocated Arab unity (also known as pan-Arabism )."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":" 193 Egypt has no oil of any consequence, but it has a m ore advanced culture than the other oil-producing Arab nations. It was the home o f one of the principal civilizations of the ancient Middle East. It is also one of the e arliest urban and literate societies. 17 Consequently, the other Arab nations have historica lly looked to Egypt for leadership. The original antagonist of Israel in the Six Day Wa r was Syria, led by General Salah al-Jadid, head of the Ba‘th regime. 18 Although Syria—under the Ba‘th regime—was an aggressive enemy of Israel, Syria’s erratic beha vior toward other Arab nations actually helped Israel. In fact, Israel used Syrian raids along the its border as a pretext for attacking Egypt and starting the Six Day War. In March 1963 Ba‘thist supporters seized power from the \"secessionist\" regime in a military coup. With the Ba‘th in power, Nasser had three Arab nations against him. Those nations were Saudi Arabia and Jordan (because they supported the ousted Imam in the Yemen war) and Syria. In April 1967 Syrian bombardments of Israeli villag es had been intensified. When the Israeli Air Force shot down six Syrian MiG planes i n reprisal, Egypt mobilized its forces near the Sinai border. 19 Egypt had a mutual defense agreement with the Syri ans, who now felt themselves in danger. As an advocate o f pan-Arabism, Nasser felt obliged to help Syria. He ordered part of the Egypt ian Army to move into Sinai. He thought that the presence of Egyptian forces would discourage the Israelis from attacking Syria. It was a purely defensive move des igned to draw off Israeli forces from Syria. If Israel had attacked Syria, then the Egyptian Army would have carried out operations in support of the Syrians. But no of fensive operations against Israel were consider. 20 A standoff between Egypt and Israel ensued, and ten sions mounted between the superpowers. The Soviet Union supported Egypt and t he United States supported Israel. This raced the stakes considerably because it introduced the possibility of nuclear war. 21 Historians now know that Israel secretly launched a n attack against Egypt, but lied about it claiming that Nasser had launched the atta ck first. In fact Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin made this admission in a speech on August 8, 1982 before the National Defense College in Jerusalem. He stated that the Si x Day War was not a \"war of necessity\" but rather a \"war of choice... Nasser did not attack us. We decided to attack him.\" 22 This was a major admission by Begin. On June 3, 1967, just two days before the Israelis attacked, the United States sent the aircraft carrier Intrepid through the Suez Canal wi th all its planes lined up on deck. Nasser thought this was an unnecessary show of forc e. The Egyptian people became furious. They lined the bank of the Canal and threw old shoes at the carrier. At the same time the Sixth Fleet flexed its muscles and pr epared for a war situation. It was an excessive show of force by the United States. 23 After Israel’s victory, Nasser was disgusted with J ohnson. He felt that Johnson was dishonest and had colluded with Israel to strike fi rst and blame it on Egypt. He was"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" 194 suspicious of America’s UN ambassador Arthur Goldbe rg, an ardent Zionist. Goldberg had immediately backed Israel in the UN wh en it claimed that Egypt \"fired the first shot.\" Nasser accused Johnson of collusio n, broke off diplomatic relations with the United States, and ordered all Americans o ut of Egypt. Several other Arab states did the same. Soon Johnson, already angered by the charge of collusion, had to watch the humiliating spectacle of twenty-four thou sand American men, women, and children being thrown out of the Middle East. Johns on never forgot and never forgave. 24 After Egypt’s humiliating defeat in the Six Day War , Nasser attempted to resign, but massive street demonstrations and a vote of confide nce by the National Assembly induced him to remain in office. The Soviet Union i mmediately began replacing all the destroyed war equipment and installed surface-t o-air missiles along the Suez as a cover for Egypt’s artillery installations. 25 An important footnote to the Six Day War is an inci dent that occurred in Yemen months earlier. In early 1967, fighting in Yemen st ill continued. One day there was shooting in Taiz (in Yemen). Direction finders indi cated that two bazooka shots came from the headquarters of the United States Point Fo ur Aid Program—which was the CIA's cover organization. Yemeni government forces attacked the building and arrested the four people inside. The safes were ope ned and an enormous number of documents were found and subsequently photographed by Egyptian intelligence experts. ( Footnote 29 ) The United States was furious at the attack on the building and demanded the documents. They were returned three we eks later, but by that time their secrets were known. Many people within the United S tates military became extremely hostile toward Nasser because of this event. Some b elieve the Six Day War was a form of retribution. 26 UN Resolution 242 Within six months after the Six Day War, the UN Sec urity Council issued Resolution 242 which called for \"withdrawal of Israeli armed f orces from territories occupied in the recent conflict.\" In theory the UN should enfor ce the resolution itself, but unfortunately, reality is much different. The sad t ruth is the UN is unable to enforce much of anything without the support of the United States, and the United States has maintained a \"passionate attachment\" to Israel ever since President Johnson was in office. Ironically, Resolution 242 was issued on the fourth anniversary of President Kennedy’s death, November 22, 1967. 27 It is an extremely important document because virtually all disputes between Israel and t he Palestinians and neighboring Arab states could be resolved by its enforcement. In addition, the Israelis managed to secure ambiguo us, legalistic wording for Resolution 242 which makes even more difficult to e nforce; 28 however, the resolution remains a highly sensitive area for American presid ents and politicians to roam.

George Ball wrote a riveting account of Israel’s at tack on the USS Liberty on June 8, 1967. Ball’s comments are significant because he wa s undersecretary of state in the Johnson and Kennedy administrations. The following text is an excerpt from Ball’s book , The Passionate Attachment: America’s Involvement With Israel, 1947 to the Present : During the [Six Day] War, Israel attacked the USS Liberty . The Liberty was an American intelligence-gathering vess el, then cruising in international waters near Egypt and rea ding the radio transmissions on both sides. It flew the American f lag and was painted in US Navy colors, complete with number and name. On the fourth day of the war [June 8, 1967], with b oth Jordan and Egypt routed, the Israelis turned their attention t o Syria, the original cause of all this trouble. Guns mounted on the Golan Heights had subjected Galilee to sporadic bombardme nt for years and the Israelis had every intention of captu ring those Heights before hostilities were over. Meanwhile, th e United Nations had adopted a cease-fire resolution and the y feared there might not be enough time to accomplish this o bjective without, as it were, going into overnight. The Liberty’s presence and function were known to Israeli leaders. They presumably thought it vital that the Liberty be prevented from informing Washington of their intent ions to violate any cease-fire before they had completed their occu pation of the Golan. Their solution was brutal and direct. Israel aircraft determined the exact location of th e ship and undertook a combined air-naval attack. Apprised of Israel’s plans from various sources, the US Navy Department faced a delicate problem. Due regard for the lives of America’s nava l personnel should have impelled the Navy to urge the State Dep artment to warn off Israel in no uncertain terms; meanwhile, t he Navy have alerted the Liberty to its danger and dispatched ships or planes for its protection. But none of these actions was t aken in time. There has, for years, been a continuing argument ab out the tragic lapse. Some say that a warning to Israel mig ht have"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" 197 exposed U.S. sources of secret intelligence. Whatev er the motive, the President or one of his aides took the decision to risk the ship and its crew, and merely ordered them, wit hout explanation, to steam west at top speed. Unhappily, that notice was too little and taken too late. Israeli ships an d planes attacked, killing 34 American sailors, wounding 75, and leaving 821 rocket and machine-gun holes in the Liberty . It was only when the Israelis were preparing to board the ship that American planes belatedly appeared from the west and forced them to retire. The sequel was unedifying. The [Johnson] administra tion tried vigorously to downplay the whole matter. Although i t silenced the crew, casualties to the sailors and damage to the s hip could not possibly be concealed. Thus, an elaborate charade w as performed. The United States complained pro forma t o Israel, which reacted by blaming the victims. The ship, the y rejoined, had not been clearly marked but looked like an Arab ship—which was definitely untrue. Nor did the Israelis even pr etend that they had queried the American Embassy in Tel Aviv regard ing the status of the well-marked ship. In the end, the Isr aelis tendered a reluctant and graceless apology; indemnities for th e victims and damaged ship were both parsimonious and slow in com ing. The sordid affair has still not been erased from the hi story books; an organization of devoted survivors has kept the caus e alive over the years by publishing a newsletter and holding we ll-advertised meetings. Yet the ultimate lesson of the Liberty attack had far more effect on policy in Israel than America. Israel’s leaders concluded that nothing they might do would offend the Americans to the point of reprisal. If America’s leaders did not have the cou rage to punish Israel for the blatant murder of American citizens, it seemed that their American friends would let them get away with almost anything.

Arthur Goldberg was a Supreme Court Justice app ointed by Kennedy to a traditionally Jewish slot in the high court. ( Footnote 30 ) At President Johnson’s request, Goldberg resigned from his position as Supreme Cour t justice to take the lower position of US ambassador to the UN. 30 This was an extraordinary move."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":" 198 Goldberg was an interesting figure. In addition to serving on the Supreme Court and as a UN diplomat, he had an impressive background i n the world of espionage. During World War II, he worked with Haganah and OSS in Palestine. After the events of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 194 1, President Roosevelt created the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), a military spy agency and precursor to the CIA. 31 New York attorney William Donovan was appointed to run the newly formed agency. With Donovan in charge of the OSS, Roosevel t had created the first civilian- run spy organization in modern US history. Donovan immediately recruited another New York attorney, Allen Dulles, to help establish the organization. Goldberg was given the rank of major and he assisted Donovan and Dulles establish an OSS field office in New York. Shortly thereafter, Goldberg be came—for all intents and purposes—an international spy working for the OSS. He was assigned various spy missions in Sweden, Germany, Spain, and Morocco. 32 With the experience he acquired in espionage, he re turned to Washington, DC and created an intelligence gathering operation. After that, he was sent on a secret mission in Palestine where he met with leaders of the illeg al army of Jewish settlers, Haganah. This operation meant a great deal to Goldberg perso nally because he had become a Zionist rather late in life. The Haganah worked wit h him to coordinate a joint OSS- Haganah parachute mission into Italy to gather crit ical intelligence information. After the Palestine encounter, Goldberg was sent to Londo n to recruit anti-Nazi Germans, who had been captured as spies when the allies inva ded France. 33 Endnotes 1.

Alfred McCoy made the following o bservation in his book, The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia : At first the American Mafia ignored this new busine ss opportunity [heroin trafficking]. Steeped in the traditions of the Sicilian \"honored society,\" which absolutely forbade involve ment in either narcotics or prostitution, the Mafia left the heroi n business to the powerful Jewish gangsters—such as \"Legs\" Diamond, \"Dutch\" Schultz, and Meyer Lansky —who dominated organized crime in the 1920s. The Mafia contented itself with the subs tantial profits to be gained from controlling the bootleg liquor in dustry. 1 However, in 1930-1931, only seven years after heroi n was legally banned, a war erupted in the Mafia ranks. Out of th e violence that left more than sixty gangsters dead came a new gene ration of leaders with little respect for the traditional cod e of honor. 2 The leader of this mafioso youth movement was the l egendary Salvatore C. Luciana, known to the world as Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano. Charming and strikingly handsome, Luciano must rank as one of the most brilliant criminal executives of the modern age. ( Footnote 31 ) For, at a series of meetings shortly following the last of the bloodbaths that completely eliminated t he old guard, Luciano outlined his plans for a modern, nationwide crime cartel. His modernization scheme quickly won total support from the leaders of America's twenty-four Mafia \"families,\" and within a few months the National Commission was functioning smoothly. This was an event of historic proportions: almost s ingle-handedly, Luciano built the Mafia into the most powerful crim inal syndicate in the United States and pioneered organizational t echniques that are still the basis of organized crime today. Lucia no also forged an alliance between the Mafia and Meyer Lansky's Je wish gangs that has survived for almost 40 years and even toda y is the dominant characteristic of organized crime in the U nited States. (Alfred McCoy, et al, The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia , pp. 17 - 18) Lucky Luciano died on January 26, 1962. Therefore h e was not directly involved in President Kennedy’s assassination. A more likely ca ndidate is Meyer Lansky. As previously stated, in 1979, the House Select Commit tee on Assassinations linked Jack Ruby to Meyer Lansky. 3 This supports my overall thesis that President Ken nedy’s assassination was ultimately a Jewish conspiracy in to which various underworld elements were lured by the promise of opium smuggli ng from Southeast Asia for heroin production in Marseilles, France and Hong Ko ng."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":" 201 China’s Vietnam Strategy in 1965 On June 23, 1965, Chinese Premier Chou En-lai dined with Egyptian President Nasser in Alexandria, Egypt. The two men reportedly enjoye d each other’s company. According to Arab scholar Mohamed Heikal, ( Footnote 32 ) Chou made the following comments to Nasser about American involvement in Vi etnam: \"We are afraid some American militarists may press for a nuclear attack on China and we think that the American invo lvement in Indochina is an insurance policy against such an at tack because we will have a lot of their flesh close to our nail s. \"So the more troops they send to Vietnam, the happi er we will be, for we feel that we will have them in our power, we can have their blood. So if you want to help the Vietnamese, you s hould encourage the Americans to throw more and more sold iers into Vietnam. \"We want them there. They will be close to China. A nd they will be in our grasp. They will be so close to us, they will be our hostages. ... \"Some of them are trying opium. And we are helping them. We are planting the best kinds of opium especially for the American soldiers in Vietnam. Do you remember when the West imposed opium on us? They fought us with opium. And we are going to fight them with their own weapons. We are going to use their own methods against them. We want them to have a big ar my in Vietnam which will be hostage to us and we want to demoralize them. The effect this demoralization is going to ha ve on the United States will be far greater than anyone reali zes. (Mohamed Heikal, The Cairo Documents , pp. 306 - 307) Premier Chou’s comments are highly significant beca use they indicate that the Chinese had a keen interest, in 1965, in the Golden Triangle and the opium produced there. In my observation, Chou’s thinking was flawe d regarding his belief that the presence of American soldiers in Vietnam would prot ect China from nuclear attack. Also, his strategy of \"helping\" the American soldie rs get hooked on opium/heroin as means of weakening the resolve of the American mili tary was somewhat naïve. My research has convinced me that the last thing the l eaders of the American military cared about during the Vietnam was the personal wel fare of its soldiers, particularly during the Johnson administration. This mindset, ho wever, changed a great deal when President Nixon came into office. "},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":" 202 History of Opium Wars The opium that Premier Chou planned to supply to Am erican soldiers in Vietnam was grown in the Golden Triangle, a mountainous area of northeastern Burma, northern Thailand, and northern Laos regarded as one of the world’s most important sources of illicit opium, morphine, and heroin. Chou also made references to two Opium Wars of the Nineteenth Century. The first opium war (1839-4 2) was between Britain and China. The second (1856-60) involved Britain and Fr ance against China. Both wars originated from China’s efforts to limit opium trad e. Early in the 19th century, British merchants began smuggling opium into China which resulted in social and economic turmoil in the coun try due to widespread addiction. In 1839, China began enforcing its prohibitions on the importation of opium. At one point, the Chinese government confiscated and destr oyed a large quantity of opium warehoused by British merchants at Guangzhou (Canto n). Britain responded by sending gunboats to attack several Chinese coastal cities. The two countries were at war for about three years. Eventually China was def eated and forced to sign the Treaty of Nanjing (1842) and the British Supplement ary Treaty of the Bogue (1843). These provided that the ports of Guangzhou, Jinmen, Fuzhou, Ningbo, and Shanghai should be open to British trade and residence. The agreements also gave Hong Kong to the British. Within a few years other Western po wers signed similar treaties with China and received commercial and residential privi leges, and the Western domination of China's treaty ports began. In 1856 a second opium war broke out following a Ch inese search of a British- registered ship, the Arrow , in Guangzhou. British and French troops took Guan gzhou and Tianjin and forced the Chinese to accept the tr eaties of Tianjin (1858), to which France, Russia, and the United States were also par ticipants. China begrudgingly agreed to open eleven more ports, permit foreign le gations in Beijing, sanction Christian missionary activity, and legalize the imp ort of opium. There was a brief peace, but China continued to res ist British efforts to import opium. In 1859, hostilities were renewed when China attemp ted to block the entry of diplomats into Beijing. This time the British and F rench occupied Beijing and burned the imperial summer palace (Yuan ming yuan). The Be ijing conventions of 1860, by which China was forced to reaffirm the terms of the Treaty of Tianjin and make additional concessions, marked the end of the secon d Opium War. 4 The Golden Triangle As previously stated, the Golden Triangle is a moun tainous area of northeastern Burma, northern Thailand, and northern Laos. Alfred McCoy described—in his book, The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia— how most of the world’s illicit opium was grown in that region of the world in 1972: Almost all of the world's illicit opium [in 1972] i s grown in a narrow band of mountains that stretches along the southern rim of the"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" 203 great Asian land mass, from Turkey's and Anatolian plateau, through the northern reaches of the Indian subconti nent, all the way to the rugged mountains of northern Laos. Withi n this 4,500- mile stretch of mountain landscape, peasants and tr ibesmen of eight different nations harvest some fourteen hundr ed tons a year of raw opium, which eventually reaches the world's heroin and opium addicts.\" A small percentage of this fourteen hundred tons is diverted from legitimate pharmaceutical producti on in Turkey, Iran, and India, but most of it is grown expressly for the international narcotics traffic in South and Southe ast Asia. Although Turkey was the major source of American na rcotics through the 1960s, the hundred tons of raw opium it s licensed peasant farmers diverted from legitimate production never accounted for more than 7 percent of the world's il licit supply. 5 About 24 percent is harvested by poppy farmers in S outh Asia (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India). However, most o f this is consumed by local opium addicts, and only insignifi cant quantities find their way to Europe or the United S tates. 6 It is Southeast Asia that has become the world's most imp ortant source of illicit opium. Every year the hill tribe farmers of Southeast Asia's Golden Triangle region-northeaster n Burma, northern Thailand, and northern Laos-harvest approx imately one thousand tons of raw opium, or about 70 percent of the world's illicit supply. 7 (Alfred McCoy, et al, The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia , p. 9) McCoy’s description of the region where most opium was grown is intriguing. He portrayed it in geographic and visual terms, rather than merely a division of man- made nation states. Again, this is how he described it: \"4,500-mile stretch of mountain landscape...in a narrow band of mountains that stretc hes along the southern rim of the great Asian land mass, from Turkey's and Anatolian plateau, through the northern reaches of the Indian subcontinent, all the way to the rugged mountains of northern Laos.\" From that description, it becomes obvious wh y the Western powers were so interested in dominating that area of the world. McCoy also implied that market forces were causing \"peasants and tribesmen of eight different nations to harvest some fourteen hundred tons a year of raw opium\" which was ultimately sold to heroin and opium addicts acr oss the world. Given that the world’s opium supply was grown in a central geographic region over which several nations ruled, it becomes significant that by the mid-1960s, the countries of Southeast Asia were the only ones left where opium production was still legal. In 1955, the Iranian government announced th e complete abolition of opium growing. 8 In 1967, the Turkish government announced plans to follow suit. 9 It apparently became known within the worldwide her oin cartel that Turkey and Iran would eventually abolish opium production. Conseque ntly, the CIA began supporting opium and heroin production in Southeast Asia in th e 1950s and 60s. Alfred McCoy"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":" 204 described—in his book, The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia— how Cold War politics influenced heroin trafficking from World W ar II through the Vietnam era. The cold war was waged in many parts of the world, but Europe was the most important battleground in the 1940s an d 1950s. Determined to restrict Soviet influence in western Europe, American clandestine operatives intervened in the i nternal politics of Germany, Italy, and France. In Sicily, the forer unner of the CIA, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), formed an alliance with the Sicilian Mafia to limit the political gain s of the Italian Communist party on this impoverished island. In Fra nce the Mediterranean port city of Marseille became a major battleground between the CIA and the French Communist party duri ng the late 1940s. To tip the balance of power in its favor, th e CIA recruited Corsican gangsters to battle Communist strikers and backed leading figures in the city's Corsican underworld w ho were at odds with the local Communists. Ironically, both th e Sicilian Mafia and the Corsican underworld played a key role in th e growth of Europe's postwar heroin traffic and were to provide most of the heroin smuggled into the United States for the next two decades. However, the mid-1960s marked the peak of the Europ ean heroin industry, and shortly thereafter it went into a sud den decline. In the early 1960s the Italian government launched a c rackdown on the Sicilian Mafia, and in 1967 the Turkish governm ent announced that it would begin phasing out cultivati on of opium poppies on the Anatolian plateau in order to depriv e Marseille's illicit heroin laboratories of their most important source of raw material. Unwilling to abandon their profitable nar cotics racket, the American Mafia and Corsican syndicates shifted their sources of supply to Southeast Asia, where surplus opium pr oduction and systematic government corruption created an ideal c limate for large-scale heroin production. And once again American foreign policy played a rol e in creating these favorable conditions. During the early 1950s the CIA had backed the formation of a Nationalist Chinese guerr illa army in Burma, which still controls almost a third of the w orld's illicit opium supply, and in Laos the CIA created a Meo mer cenary army whose commander manufactured heroin for sale t o Americans GIs in South Vietnam. The State Departmen t provided unconditional support for corrupt governments openl y engaged in the drug traffic. In late 1969 new heroin laborator ies sprang up in the tri-border area where Burma, Thailand, and Laos converge, and unprecedented quantities of heroin started floo ding into the United States. Fueled by these seemingly limitless supplies of heroin, America's total number of addicts skyrocket ed. (Alfred McCoy, et al, The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia , pp. 7-8)"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" 205 It should be noted that the group of Americans hit hardest by heroin addition was poor blacks living in the inner cities. Given that right -wing extremists like Joseph Milteer apparently joined the coup against Kennedy (referen ce Chapter 7), the targeting of black communities for illicit heroin sales was like ly no accident. Origins of the Vietnam War The Vietnam War began in 1955 and ended in 1975. Du ring the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, American involvement in Vi etnam was limited to clandestine espionage and training the South Vietna mese army. Kennedy increased the number of \"military advisors\" from about 800 to 16,000; however, this was done primarily as a show of strength to the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War. As tensions eased between the two superpowers in th e spring, summer, and fall of 1963, Kennedy announced plans to withdraw forces fr om South Vietnam, starting with a thousand men by the end of 1963. Immediately after Kennedy’s death, President Johnson rescinded the withdrawal plan and began sending more troops to that country. On August 2, 1964, North Vietnamese patrol boats fi red on the U.S. destroyer Maddox in the Gulf of Tonkin, and, after President Johnson asserted that there had been a second attack on August 4—a claim later show n to be false—the U.S. Congress almost unanimously endorsed the Gulf of To nkin Resolution authorizing the president to take \"all necessary measures to repel attacks . . . and prevent further aggression.\" The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in effec t gave the president carte blanche to wage war in Southeast Asia without Congressional approval. This marked the beginning of full-scale American involvement in the Vietnam War. When Johnson left office in January 1969, there were about 540,0 00 10 American soldiers—mostly draftees—in Vietnam in sharp contrast to the 16,000 military advisers—non- draftees—present when Kennedy was killed in 1963. Reasons for the War There are three popular explanations for the Vietna m War. Western diplomats, politicians, and historians state that it was an un successful effort by South Vietnam and the United States to prevent the communists of North Vietnam from uniting South Vietnam with North Vietnam under their leadership. The Vietnamese government would have us believe it was merely a civil war tha t occurred after Vietnam declared its independence from Japan ( Footnote 33 ) at the end of World War II. But in Alfred McCoy’s book, The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia , he suggested that the war was as much about the illicit export of opium as an ything else. My research indicates that it was a combination of all three, but was int ensified by the assassination of President Kennedy. Furthermore, historical evidence indicates that the Vietnam War was a continuation of the two Opium Wars of the Nineteenth Century in whi ch the Western powers forced China to import opium. As governments learned more about the dangers of opium and"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" 206 heroin, it became unnacceptable—purely for public r elations reasons—for the Western powers to overtly export narcotics to China and other countries. Over time, drug trafficking continued but its management shift ed to international espionage services and organized crime which were secretly sa nctioned by the Western governments. Eventually drug smuggling began to dri ve the foreign policies of the Western powers, and vice-versa. This entanglement, in my view, became the impetus behind Western involvement in the Vietnam War. It a lso appears that this situation was exploited by friends of Israel as a means of se tting up the assassination of President Kennedy. As previously stated, it was Jewish gangsters—such as \"Legs\" Diamond, \"Dutch\" Schultz, and Meyer Lansky—who introduced the heroin business to the American Mafia in the 1920s. In addition, the American Mafia —which was primarily of Sicilian origin in the 1920s—forbade involvement of either n arcotics or prostitution. Such activity was left to the Jewish gangsters. 11 This is a critical fact that further supports my conclusion that a Jewish conspiracy as the ultim ate sponsor of the Kennedy assassination. Vietnam History, From 1941 to 1963 In 1941, the League for the Independence of Vietnam —generally known as the Viet Minh—was organized as a nationalistic party seeking Vietnamese independence from France. On September 2, 1945, less than a month after the J apanese surrendered in World War II, Ho Chi Minh, leader of the Viet Minh, formally declared Vietnam's independence. The Viet Minh had a strong base of popular support in northern Vietnam. The French wanted to reassert control in Indochina, however, a nd would recognize Vietnam only as a free state within the French Union. In the mid-1950s, Vietnam became openly communist. In 1946, fighting between the French and the Viet Minh broke out—and continued un til 1954—when the French were badly defeated in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. An international conference in Geneva in 1954 negotiated a cease-fire. To separate the warring forces, the conferees decided that the French and the Vietnamese fighting under French command would move south of the 17th parallel and the Viet Minh w ould go north of the 17th parallel, which was established as a military demarcation lin e surrounded by a demilitarized zone (DMZ). Thousands of people accordingly moved n orth or south away from their homes, and the French began their final departure f rom Vietnam. The agreement left the communist-led Viet Minh in control of the north ern half of Vietnam, which came to be known as North Vietnam, while the noncommunis t southern half became South Vietnam. Ngo Dinh Diem became South Vietnam's prime minister during the armistice negotiations. The Geneva Accords stipulated that free elections b e held throughout Vietnam in 1956 under the supervision of an International Cont rol Committee with the aim of reunifying North and South Vietnam under a single p opularly elected government.

But Diem, who had solidified his control over South Vietnam, refused in 1956 to hold the sch eduled elections. The United States supported his position. In response, the Nor th Vietnamese decided to unify South with North Vietnam through military force rat her than by political means. U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, fearing the spread of communism in Asia, persuaded the U.S. government to provide economic a nd military assistance to the Diem regime, which became increasingly unpopular wi th the people of South Vietnam. Diem replaced the traditionally elected vi llage councils with Saigon- appointed administrators. He also aroused the ire o f the Buddhists by selecting his fellow Roman Catholics (most of whom had moved to S outh Vietnam from the North) for top government positions. Diem’s government beg an mistreating the Buddhists to the point that there were riots in the streets; Bud dhists monks publicly committed suicide by setting themselves on fire. Guerrilla warfare spread as Viet Minh soldiers who were trained and armed in the North—the Viet Cong—returned to their homes in the South to assassinate, ambush, sabotage, and proselytize. The Diem government aske d for and received more American military advisers and equipment to build u p the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and the police force, but it could n ot halt the growing presence of the South Vietnamese communist forces, or Viet Cong . 12 From 1962 until 1963, President Kennedy increased t he number noncombat military advisers from 800 to 16,000. 13 Vietnam was a Divisive Issue Within JFK’s Governmen t The Vietnam War was obviously a divisive issue duri ng the Johnson and Nixon years, but few people realize how divisive it was while Ke nnedy was still president. Historian Michael Beschloss wrote that Vietnam was tearing Kennedy’s government apart in the summer of 1963: Kennedy later told Charles Bartlett, \"My God, my go vernment’s coming apart!\" Robert Kennedy recalled that week [e nd of August 1963] as \"the only time, really, in three years tha t the government was broken in two in a disturbing way.\" He later sa id, ‘Diem was corrupt and a bad leader... but we inherited him.\" He thought it bad policy to \"replace somebody we didn’t like with somebody we do because it would just make every other country n ervous as can be that we were running coups in and out.\" (Michael Beschloss, The Crisis Years , p. 653) Oct. 31, 1963: Kennedy Announced Withdrawal From Vi etnam"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":" 208 On October 31, 1963 in a press conference, Kennedy publicly announced his intention to withdraw a thousand men from South Vietnam by th e end of 1963.

And there has b een some reference to that by General Harkins. If we’re able to do that, that will be our schedule. I think the first unit, the f irst contingent, would be 250 men who are not involved in what might be called front-line operations. It would be our hope to less on the number of Americans there by a thousand as the training in tensifies and is carried on in South Vietnam.

Kennedy Library, audio-visual departmen t, Columbia Point, Boston, MA 02125.] Nov. 1, 1963: Diem Assassinated in CIA Backed Coup The very next day, on Nov. 1, 1963, South Vietnames e President Ngo Dinh Diem was killed in a CIA backed coup. As previously stated, Diem—a Roman Catholic—had upset the Buddhists by selecting fellow Roman Catho lics (most of whom had moved to South Vietnam from the North) for top government positions. There was a public backlash—riots in the streets; Buddhists monks publ icly committed suicide by setting themselves on fire. Diem became an embarrassment to the United States and was encouraged to resign, but he refused. Diem’s assassination pulled the US deeper into the Vietnam conflict, a conflict Kennedy was trying to pull away from. There is a qu estion as to whether Kennedy had approved the coup. Some historians claim that h e knew of it; however, he was extremely upset at hearing of Diem’s murder. Here a re some cites: The news of Diem’s death outraged Kennedy. General [Maxwell] Taylor wrote that he \"leaped to his feet and rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his face which I had never seen before.\" George Smathers remembered that Jack Kennedy"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" 209 blamed the CIA, saying \"I’ve got to do something ab out those bastards;\" they should be stripped of their exorbit ant power. Mike Forrestal called Kennedy’s reaction \"both personal and religious,\" and especially troubled by the implication that a C atholic President had participated in a plot to assassinate a coreligionist. Every account of Kennedy’s response is in complete agreement. Until the very end he had hoped Diem’s life could b e spared. (Herbert Parmet, JFK: the Presidency of John F. Kennedy , p. 335.) I saw the President soon after he heard that Diem a nd Nhu were dead. He was somber and shaken. I had not seen him so depressed since the Bay of Pigs. (Arthur Schlesinger, A Thousand Days , p. 997] In the Situation Room, Kennedy was monitoring the c oup when told of the murders. He rushed out of the room. For restal felt that the assassination \"shook him personally\" and \"bothe red him as a moral and religious matter. It shook his confidence , I think, in the kind of advice he was getting about South Vietnam.\" (Michael Beschloss, The Crisis Years , p. 657) Over the next year, countless CIA backed government s rose and fell in South Vietnam. 14 Nov. 24, 1963: Johnson Rescinded Kennedy’s Withdraw al Order On November 24, 1963, two days after Kennedy’s assa ssination, President Johnson quietly rescinded Kennedy’s order to withdraw a tho usand men from Vietnam by the end of the year. On Sunday afternoon, November 24, [1963], Lyndon Jo hnson kept the dead President’s appointment with [U.S. Am bassador Henry Cabot] Lodge and told him that he was not wil ling to ‘lose Vietnam.’: ‘Tell those generals in Saigon that Lynd on Johnson intends to stand by our word.’ (Michael Beschloss, The Crisis Years , p. 680) Aug. 2, 1964: Gulf of Tonkin Incident Occurred.

T his was the beginning of large- scale military involvement in Vietnam. Here is a su mmary of the Gulf of Tonkin incident: [On August 2, 1964,] three North Vietnamese boats f ired torpedoes at [U.S. destroyer Maddox]. Maddox gunner s and jets from the nearby Ticonderoga fired back, crippling t wo of the vessels and sinking the third. President Johnson rejected further reprisals. Using the hot line to Moscow for the first time, he cabled Khruschev that he did not wish to widen the conflict but hoped that North Vie tnam would not attack other American vessels in international wate rs. The Maddox and another destroyer, the C. Turner Joy , were ordered to sail eight miles off the North Vietnames e coast, four miles off the offshore islands. The commandos from the South resumed their operations. On Sunday evening, interc epted radio messages gave the Maddox commander, Captain John He rrick, the ‘impression’ that Communist patrol boats were a bout to attack. With air support from the Ticonderoga, the Maddox and Turner Joy began firing. Maddox officers reported twenty-two enemy torpedoes , none of which scored a hit, and two or three enemy vessels sunk. But when the firing stopped, Herrick warned his superio rs that the ‘entire action leaves many doubts’; no sailor on th e destroyer had seen or heard enemy gunfire. An ‘overeager’ young s onar operator who had counted torpedoes may have been mi sled by ‘freak weather effects.’ Nevertheless the President ordered bombing of North Vietnam for the first time and unveiled the document now ch ristened the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. Language was broadened t o authorize Johnson to ‘take all necessary measures’ to protect American forces and ‘prevent further aggression.’ The Senate passed it [on August 7, 1964] with only two dissenters. (Michael Beschloss, The Crisis Years , p. 694) Johnson also made a false claim—supported by the ne ws media—that on August 4, 1964, the North Vietnamese attacked US destroyers a second time. 15 Here is a transcript of President Johnson describin g the Gulf of Tonkin Incident to Robert Anderson, former Secretary of Treasury in th e Eisenhower administration, the day after the attack."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" 211 [MONDAY, AUGUST 3, 1964:] There have been some covert operations in that area that we have been carrying on – blowing up some bridges and things of that kind, roads and so forth.

(Michael Beschloss, Taking Charge , pp. 529-531) As we know, Johnson changed his mind, was re-electe d in 1964, and served four more years as president. Nevertheless, it is import ant to remember that Johnson got cold feet just 18 days after Congress ratified the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution which was basically a declaration of war against North Vietna m after we had clearly provoked them into attacking us (or not attacking us as some believe). While Johnson complained mostly about racial problems and not bei ng able do deal with Southern whites or Negroes in general, he also mentioned Ton kin Gulf. Clearly it was on his mind. Oct. 14, 1964: Khrushchev Toppled It is interesting that Khrushchev was toppled from power on October 14, 1964, less than a year after Kennedy was killed. Equally inter esting, Khrushchev’s political demise occurred less than two and a half months aft er the Gulf of Tonkin incident and the subsequent ratification of the Gulf of Tonkin R esolution by Congress (August 2-7, 1964). Another point of interest is that the term \"Cold Wa r\" was coined by Bernard Baruch, 16 an influential Wall Street financier, top advisor t o President Roosevelt, and ardent Zionist. I am intrigued that two other world leaders mention ed by Kennedy in the American University speech left their positions as heads of state within a close proximity in time to Kennedy’s assassination. ... Chairman Khrushchev, Prime Minister Macmillan, an d I have agreed that high-level discussions will shortly beg in in Moscow looking toward early agreement on a comprehensive t est ban treaty.

Health problems notwiths tanding, Macmillan lived another twenty-three years. He died on December 29, 1986. It seems must intriguing that three heads of state who framed the nuclear te st ban treaty stepped down or were removed from power within a year. Johnson Escalated the War After 1965 U.S. involvement in the war escalated ra pidly. On the night of Feb. 7, 1965, the Viet Cong attacked the U.S. base at Pleik u, killing 8 soldiers and wounding 126 more. Johnson in response ordered another repri sal bombing of North Vietnam. Three days later the Viet Cong raided another U.S. military installation at Qui Nhon, and Johnson ordered more aerial attacks against Han oi. On March 6, two battalions of Marines landed on the beaches near Da Nang to relie ve that beleaguered city. By June 50,000 U.S. troops had arrived to fight with the AR VN. Small contingents of the North Vietnamese army began fighting with the Viet Cong in South Vietnam, which they reached via the Ho Chi Minh Trail west of the Cambodian border. The government in Saigon was now headed by Air Vice -Marshal Nguyen Cao Ky, but he was unable to check the rapidly deteriorating mi litary situation. NLF forces were gaining control of more and more areas of the count ryside, and a communist victory seemed imminent. President Johnson's response was t o pledge the United States to defend South Vietnam and to send more troops. By th e end of 1965, 180,000 Americans were serving in South Vietnam under the c ommand of General William C. Westmoreland. After mid-1966 the United States and the ARVN initi ated a series of new tactics in their intensifying counterinsurgency effort, but th eir efforts to drive the Viet Cong from the countryside and separate them from their c ivilian supporters were only partly successful. The U.S. troops depended heavily on sup erior firepower and on helicopters for rapid deployment into targeted rura l areas. The Viet Cong depended on stealth, concealment, and surprise attacks and ambu shes. U.S. troop strength in South Vietnam rose to 389,00 0 men in 1967, but, despite their sophisticated weapons, the Americans could not erad icate the skillful and determined insurgents. More North Vietnamese troops arrived to bolster the NLF forces in the South. A presidential election, in which all candid ates who favored negotiating with the NLF were banned, was held in South Vietnam in S eptember, and General Nguyen Van Thieu became president, with Ky as vice preside nt. On January 30, 1968, the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong launched a massive surprise offensive during the Tet (lunar new year) Vietnamese festival. They attacked 36 major South Vietnamese cities and towns. The fig hting at this time was especially fierce in Saigon and in the city of Hue, which the NLF held for several weeks. The NLF suffered heavy losses (33,000 killed) in the Te t Offensive, and the ranks of the Viet Cong were so decimated by the fighting that, f rom 1968 on, the majority of the"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":" 216 insurgents in South Vietnam were actually North Vie tnamese soldiers who had infiltrated into the South. Although the general up rising that the NLF had expected in support had not materialized, the offensive had an important strategic effect, because it convinced a number of Americans that, contrary t o their government's claims, the insurgency in South Vietnam could not be crushed an d the war would continue for years to come. In the United States, sentiment against U.S. partic ipation in the war mounted steadily from 1967 on and expressed itself in peace marches, demonstrations, and acts of civil disobedience. Growing numbers of politicians and or dinary citizens began to question whether the U.S. war effort could succeed and even whether it was morally justifiable in a conflict that some interpreted as a Vietnamese civil war. General Westmoreland requested more troops in order to widen the war after the Tet Offensive, but the shifting balance of American pub lic opinion now favored \"de- escalation\" of the conflict. On March 31, 1968, Pre sident Johnson announced in a television address that bombing north of the 20th p arallel would be stopped and that he would not seek reelection to the presidency in t he fall. Hanoi responded to the decreased bombing by de-escalating its insurgency e fforts, and in October Johnson ordered a total bombing halt. During the interim th e United States and Hanoi had agreed to begin preliminary peace talks in Paris, a nd General Creighton Abrams became the new commander of U.S. forces in South Vi etnam. 17 When Johnson stepped down from the presidency in Ja nuary 1969, there were about 540,000 18 U.S. military personnel in South Vietnam. The Assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Lut her King Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy were likel y killed because the latter was about to assume the presidency and former was endor sing him. Both wanted to end US involvement in the Vietnam War, but several inte rests would prevail over their wishes. First, the right-wing extremists hated both men because of they—along with President Kennedy—had embarrassed George Wallace in June 1963 when the Alabama National Guard forced him to allow black st udents to enroll at the University of Alabama. Second, Israel absolutely di d not want the son of Joseph Kennedy to become president. None of the Kennedys w ere considered friends of Israel. Consequently, the Irish-American family cou ld not be counted on to support Israel’s annexation program of expanding its border s into neighboring Arab territories. Third, American and French-Corsican-Latino crime fa milies wanted the Vietnam War to continue because they were reaping huge profits from the Golden Triangle from its production of opium. Those profits were apparently being shared with senior military personnel as well. In March of 1967 Senator Robert Kennedy announced a peace plan for Vietnam and soon became an outspoken antiwar advocate. 19 Martin Luther King quickly followed the senator’s lead. On April 4, 1967, at Riverside Church in New York City and again on the 15th at a mammoth peace rally in that city, King committed himself irrevocably to opposing US involvement in the Vietn am War. Once before, in early"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":" 217 January 1966, he had condemned the war, but officia l outrage from Washington and strenuous opposition within the black community its elf had caused him to acquiesce. 20 On Jan. 30, 1968, the Tet Offensive began. It marke d a new beginning of anti-war sentiment amongst many Americans. Gene McCarthy had been campaigning for the presidency on the Democratic ticket. On March 16, 1 968, Robert Kennedy announced his candidacy for the presidency; 21 Martin Luther King immediately endorsed him. On March 31, 1968, President Johnson startled telev ision viewers with a national address that included three announcements: (1) he h ad just ordered major reductions in the bombing of North Vietnam, (2) he was request ing peace talks, and (3) he would neither seek nor accept his party's renomination fo r the presidency. 22 On April 4 King was killed by a sniper's bullet while standing on t he balcony of a motel in Memphis, Tennessee where he and his associates were staying. On March 10, 1969, the accused assassin, James Earl Ray, pleaded guilty to the mur der and was sentenced to 99 years in prison. 23 Ray later recanted his confession. By June 4, 1968 Robert Kennedy had won five out of six presidential primaries, including one that day in California. Shortly after midnight on June 5 ( Footnote 35 ) he spoke to his followers in Los Angeles' Ambassador H otel. As he left through a kitchen hallway he was fatally wounded by a Palesti nian immigrant, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan; at least that’s the official story. Robert Kennedy died the next day on June 6, 1968. 24 1968: LBJ Attempted to Appoint Abe Fortas as Chief Justice One of the last things President Johnson attempted while in the White House was to nominate a Jewish American, Abe Fortas, as Chief Ju stice of the Supreme Court. In 1965, President Johnson appointed Fortas—a longtime political crony—to the Jewish slot in the Supreme Court, replacing Arthur Goldber g. As previously stated, Goldberg had resigned from the high court—at Johnson’s reque st—to serve as US delegate to the UN following the death of the Adlai Stevenson w ho held that post until his untimely demise. Stevenson had died unexpectedly of a heart attack on July 14, 1965. Three years later, in 1968, Johnson nominated Forta s to replace retiring Chief Justice Earl Warren. When the nomination came to the Senate floor, a filibuster ensued. On October 1, 1968, the Senate failed to vote because of the filibuster and Johnson then withdrew the nomination. With that, Fortas became t he first nominee for that post since 1795 to fail to receive Senate approval. 25 ( Footnote 36 ) After sending 540,000 26 U.S. military personnel to South Vietnam, then dec lining to run for a second term, one of the last things the l ame duck President Johnson attempted was to appoint Abe Fortas—a Jewish crony— as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. This incident, combined with his lon g-standing passionate attachment to Israel (Chapter 10), further supports my earlier assertion that the 36 th President of the United States, and his wife, were both secretly Jewish (Chapter 9).

Nixon later disputed its labeling as \"secret.\" In a speec h before the Veterans of Foreign Wars in New Orleans on August 20, 1973, he explained tha t the decision was made only two months after he became president. He further st ated that the decision was made in a meeting attended by Secretary of Defense, Melvin Laird; National Security Advisor, Henry Kissinger; Secretary of State, William Rogers ; and head of the CIA. He also stated that the bombing plan was \"disclosed to appr opriate Government leaders\" and the \"appropriate Congressional leaders, those in th e Military Affairs Committee like Eddie Hebert.\" ( Footnote 37 ) He added that \"there was no secrecy as far as Gove rnment leaders were concerned, who had any right to know o r need to know.\" Nixon had apparently been led to believe by his adv isors that the lives of American soldiers were at risk because the North Vietnamese were setting up sanctuaries and staging areas in Cambodia. \"If American soldiers in the field today were simil arly threatened by an enemy,\" he explained, \"and if the price of protecting those so ldiers was to order air strikes to save American lives, I would make the same decision toda y that I made in February of 1969.\" He admitted that the military action was kept secre t from the American public, but only because \"the bombing would have had to sto p\" 1 if the public had been informed. Nixon’s description of the decision to bomb Cambodi a—which he made as a new president—was surprisingly similar to Kennedy’s ind octrination as a new president when faced with the Bay of Pigs ordeal in April of 1961. To fully appreciate Nixon’s plight, it is important to remember that President Johnson had escalated the number of American soldiers in South Vietnam from 16,000 ( Footnote 38 ) when Kennedy was killed to 540,000 when Johnson left office in January of 1 969. Johnson had abdicated his leadership—by announcing in March of 1968 that he w ould not seek re-election— thereby leaving his successor with the nightmare of Vietnam, a foreign policy disaster in a colossal state of senseless confusion and disc ontinuity. Unfortunately, this is what Nixon’s critics selectively forget when denouncing him for the so-called \"secret\" bombing campaign in Cambodia. Nixon’s critics tend to forget that he stepped into the presidency with half a million soldiers—mostly eighteen year-old boys—placed in harm’s way on foreign soil. Nixon was obviously concerned for the safety of tho se half-million soldiers, and as the new president, was probably pressured by his ad visers to make a bad decision as Kennedy was pressured eight years earlier regarding the Bay of Pigs. Both made the wrong decision, but neither did so in a vacuum. Bot h kept the decision secret from the American public, but not a secret from the appropri ate people within government. I would venture to state that most \"informed\" Ameri cans today have been led to believe that Nixon’s \"secret\" bombing campaign in C ambodia was literally a \"secret\" in every sense of the word. Most people believe Nix on somehow managed to initiate a"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" 221 military campaign against a foreign country without informing anyone in government because this is the spin that has been pushed by pr opagandists within the news media and the bookpublishing industry for years. But Nixo n’s explanation seems perfectly believable. Thinking rationally, how would he have kept such a program a secret within the United States government? Did he persona lly fly a plane to Cambodia and drop the bombs himself? Obviously this is absurd. H e made a command decision in the middle of a war with the full knowledge of his advisors and the appropriate leaders in Congress. The reason he made the decisio n was to save the lives of half a million American soldiers put in harm’s way by his predecessor. Nixon’s Eight Point Strategy to end the Vietnam War When Nixon campaigned for the presidency in 1968, h e pledged repeatedly that he had a \"secret plan\" to end the Vietnam War. As the years passed, people forgot about his pledge. But it begs a question now as it in 196 8. Why did the plan have to be secret? He was president, why couldn’t he just with draw? The Vietnam War was a major liability for him politically. Few Americans would have objected, not even supporters of the war. What prevented Nixon from us ing his constitutional power as Command-in-Chief of the military to withdraw forces as he saw fit? In Oliver Stone’s movie, Nixon , it was suggested that the 37 th president did not have authority to make such a dramatic decision. There was a scene in the movie where Nixon agreed with a young female protester who described the government al forces keeping American troops in Vietnam as a \"wild animal.\" Upon reflecti on, her description seems accurate. Nixon’s plan apparently needed to remain secret in order to tame the wild animal. If one accepts the premise that the Vietnam War was merely a continuation of the two opium wars of the Nineteenth Century (Chapter 11), then logic would dictate that it was not within a sitting US president’s power to me rely withdraw military forces from South Vietnam by issuing an executive order. A lso, Nixon may have known who killed the Kennedys and Martin Luther and why. No one knows for certain if Nixon’s foreign policy was part of a well-conceived strategy to end the Vietnam War, or if it was a series of random decisions made with out a grand purpose. Nevertheless, he performed the following eight tasks which ultima tely achieved peace—albeit a short-lived one—in Southeast Asia. 1. He dramatically increased aid to Israel. 2. He reduced American forces in South Vietnam from 54 0,000 (June 1969) to 160,000 (Dec. 1971) through a program called \"Vietn amization.\" 3. He established diplomatic relations with China. 4. He used his new friendship with China as leverage t o establish détente between the United States and the Soviet Union. 5. He broke up Auguste Joseph Ricord’s heroin cartel. ( Footnote 39 ) 6. He intensified US bombing of North Vietnam in order to get that government to participate in the Paris peace talks. 7. He withdrew American forces from Vietnam. 8. He ended the draft."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" 222 The first point was to dramatically increase Americ an aid to Israel. In a word Nixon bought them off. By doing so he created division am ong friends of Israel. He gave Israel about $1.61 billion from 1971 through 1973. That was a huge increase— approximately the same amount the United States had given Israel over its entire 22 year history (from 1948 through 1970). 2 If Nixon believed that US involvement in the Vietnam War and President Kennedy’s assassination w ere the results of a Jewish conspiracy, then his colossal increase of foreign a id to Israel was completely understandable. He was dividing his enemies. The second point was to initiate a program called \" Vietnamization\" which reduced American forces in South Vietnam from 540,000 in Ja nuary 1969 to 335,000 by late 1970, then to 160,000 by late 1971, and finally a c omplete withdrawal by the end of 1973. In addition, Vietnamization gradually made th e South Vietnamese army assume all military responsibilities for their defense whi le being abundantly supplied with US arms, equipment, air support, and economic aid. US commanders in the field were instructed to keep casualties to \"an absolute minim um,\" and losses decreased appreciably. The third point was to establish diplomatic relatio ns with China. Nixon personally visited China in February 1972 after a 21-year estr angement with the United States. This was a bold diplomatic move for an American pre sident. But his new friendship with China gave him leverage to negotiate with the Soviet Union which would lead to an era of détente between the two superpowers. 3 The fourth point was to establish détente with the Soviet Union. In May of 1972 Nixon paid a state visit to Moscow to sign 10 forma l agreements, the most important of which were the nuclear-arms limitation treaties known as SALT I (based on the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks conducted between t he United States and the Soviet Union beginning in 1969) and a memorandum, the Basi c Principles of U.S.-Soviet Relations, summarizing the new relationship between the two countries in the new era of détente. 4 Although the Soviet Union continued to exist for 1 9 more years, ( Footnote 40 ) Nixon ended the Cold War—for all intents and purpos es—in May of 1972 when he and Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev signed the SALT I agreements. It is significant that the Watergate burglary occurred just one month later, on June 17, 1972. The fifth point was to break up Auguste Joseph Rico rd’s heroin cartel. Nixon’s war on drugs reached a zenith with the extradition of R icord from Paraguay which occurred around the same time of his trip to China followed by his meeting with Brezhnev in Moscow in the spring of 1972. ( Footnote 41 ) By going after Ricord, Nixon was assaulting the top underworld figure responsibl e for smuggling heroin into the United States at that time. The profits from Ricord ’s heroin smuggling efforts were apparently divided among international crime syndic ates and various espionage organizations which funneled the illicit drug money to the power elite in Israel and the Western Powers (i.e., United States, Britain and Fr ance). Nixon was indeed tangling with a \"wild animal\" when he went after Ricord. The sixth point was to intensify US bombing of Nort h Vietnam in order to get that government to participate in the Paris peace talks. By doing this Nixon created division within the military, many of whom actually wanted to win the war and had no interest in drug smuggling."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":" 223 The seventh point was to withdrew American forces f rom Vietnam. By the time Nixon did this, he had done several other things—th e first six points—to set the stage for the seventh point. The eighth point was to abolish the draft completel y. This made it extremely difficult for succeeding presidents to get involved in anothe r Vietnam War. Before starting another full-scale war, the next president would fi rst have to reinstate the draft— something the American public would resist. Ending the draft was perhaps Nixon’s greatest contribution to world peace. The Conclusion of the Vietnam War In March 1972 the North Vietnamese invaded the demi litarized zone (DMZ) ( Footnote 42 ) and captured Quang Tri province. President Nixon re sponded by ordering the mining of Haiphong and other North Vietnamese ports and an intense bombing of the North. Peace talks resumed in July, but the talks broke do wn in mid-December with each side accusing the other of bargaining in bad faith. Nixon responded by subjecting Hanoi and other North Vietnamese cities to 11 days of intensive U.S. bombing (later called the \"Christmas bombing.\") The relentless Christmas bombing forced the North V ietnamese back to the Paris peace talks which resulted in a cease-fire agreemen t on Jan. 27, 1973. A cease-fire would go into effect the following morning througho ut North and South Vietnam, all U.S. forces would be withdrawn and all its bases di smantled, all prisoners of war would be released, an international force would kee p the peace, the South Vietnamese would have the right to determine their own future, and North Vietnamese troops could remain in the South but would not be reinforc ed. The 17th parallel would remain the dividing line until the country could be reunited by \"peaceful means.\" This pact was augmented by a second 14-point accord sign ed in June. In August the U.S. Congress proscribed any further U.S. military activ ity in Indochina. By the end of 1973 there were few U.S. military personnel left in South Vietnam. But the fighting continued in spite of the cease-fi re agreements, and North and South Vietnam each denounced the other for numerous viola tions of the truce. Casualties, both military and civilian, were as high as they ha d ever been. The year 1974 was characterized by a series of smal l offensives as each side sought to seize land and people from the other. The North Vie tnamese began preparing for a major offensive to be launched in either 1975 or 19 76, while the South Vietnamese tried to hold all of the areas under their control, although they lacked the strength to do so. South Vietnam's difficulties were compounded when the United States drastically cut its military aid in August 1974. ( Footnote 43 ) The morale and combat effectiveness of South Vietnam’s army—aka, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN)—plummeted as a result. In December 1974 the North Vietnamese attacked Phuo c Binh, a provincial capital about 60 miles (100 km) north of Saigon. Their capt ure of this city in early January 1975 convinced the North Vietnamese that a full-sca le invasion of the South was now"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":" 224 practicable. Accordingly, in early March, North Vie tnamese forces began a large- scale offensive in the central highlands. When Pres ident Thieu ordered a withdrawal of all ARVN forces not only from the central highla nds but from the northernmost two provinces of the country as well, general panic ensued, and the South Vietnamese military machine began to come apart. The withdrawa ls rapidly became routs as large ARVN units disintegrated into columns of refugees. One by one the coastal cities were abandoned, and by early April the ARVN had aba ndoned the northern half of their country to the North Vietnamese forces. The t roops of the ARVN began to melt away, and the remaining Americans escaped by air an d sealifts with Vietnamese friends and coworkers. On April 21, President Thieu resigned and flew to Taiwan. On April 30 what remained of the South Vietnamese gove rnment surrendered unconditionally, and North Vietnamese tank columns occupied Saigon without a struggle. A military government was instituted, and on July 2, 1976, the country was officially united as the Socialist Republic of Viet nam with its capital in Hanoi. Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City. The Watergate Burglary (June 17, 1972) Near the end of President Nixon’s first term, on Ju ne 17, 1972, five men were arrested breaking into the Democratic national headquarters in the Watergate office- appartment building in Washington, DC. It was quick ly learned that the arrested burglars had been hired by the Committee to Re-Elec t the President (CRP). Immediately, attorney general John Mitchell resigne d as director of the CRP. Clearly, this was an embarrassment for President Nixon, but the incident did not impact the ensuing fall elections which Nixon won by a landsli de. The Democrats retained majorities in the House and Senate. A few days after the break-in, charges of burglary and wiretapping were brought against the five men arrested at the scene, plus tw o additional officials within the Nixon administration. They were E. Howard Hunt, Jr. , a former White House aide, and G. Gordon Liddy, general counsel for the Commit tee for the Re-Election of the President. Investigation into the scandal continued for the ne xt two years and culminated with the resignation of President Nixon on August 9, 197 4. 6 As previously mentioned, the Watergate burglary occ urred a month after the SALT I agreements were signed by Nixon and Breshnev. SALT I and accompanying agreements marked a new era of détente between the two superpowers. Division Between Nixon and the Military As it turns out, Watergate was not the only cover-u p in the Nixon White House. Joan Hoff, a research professor of history at Montana St ate University, recently wrote an article asserting that on December 21, 1971—six mon ths before the Watergate burglary occurred—Nixon approved the first major co ver-up of his administration;"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":" 225 however, he was not covering up his own misdeeds. H e was covering up the Navy’s. Nixon had learned that Admiral Thomas Moorer, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had authorized his subordinates to spy on the White House’s National Security Counsel. For thirteen months, from 1970 to late 197 1, Navy Yeoman Charles E. Radford systematically stole and copied NSC documen ts from Alexander Haig, Henry Kissinger, and their staff. When Nixon learned of t his, he ordered it hushed up; but he let the military know he was aware of the spying. A pparently Nixon and his aides thought that approach would give them more leverage with a hostile defense establishment. 7 Bob Woodward and Naval Intelligence The news media slowly began to cover the Watergate burglary. Several major newspapers investigated the possible involvement of the White House in the break-in. Leading the pack was The Washington Post and its two young reporters, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, whose stories were base d largely on information from an unnamed source called \"Deep Throat\"; the mysteri ous identity of Deep Throat became a news story in its own right and continues to be speculated on to this day. The journalistic integrity of Yale graduate Bob Woo dward became tainted and comprised years later when it was revealed, by auth ors Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin, that prior to working at the Washington Po st, Woodward had worked at the Pentagon for the Office of Naval Intelligence as a Naval Lieutenant. Silent Coup —a 1991 book by Colodny and Gettlin—reveals that in 19 69, the twenty-six-year-old Lieutenant was the briefing officer for Admiral Moo rer, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who had authorized his subordinates to spy on the White House’s National Security Counsel. A briefing officer sees, hears, r eads, and assimilates information from one of several sources and passes it on to mor e senior officers. This is a coveted position for young officers seeking career advancem ent. The work is often Top Secret. Colodny and Gettlin asserted that Admiral Moorer se nt Lieutenant Woodward to the basement of the White House to act as a briefer for Alexander Haig. 8 The ramifications of this information are staggering. Nixon’s War on Drugs On June 17, 1971 Nixon declared that heroin addicti on was \"Public Enemy No. 1,\" ( Footnote 44 ) and he targeted Auguste Joseph Ricord for extradit ion from Paraguay and prosecution in the US for managing large-scale hero in smuggling into America. 9 This may have been the straw that broke the camel’s back . Nixon had become too bold, too independent. His war on drugs even led to the demis e of Lucien Sarti—the French- Corsican assassin who fatally shot President Kenned y in the right temple with an exploding bullet—when Mexican agents shot and kille d him in Mexico City on April 27, 1972. 10 "},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":" 226 In his first three and a half years as president, N ixon got Congress to increase the Bureau of Narcotics’ annual budget from $14 million to $74 million and expanded its agent force from 600 to 1,600. The Bureau of Custom s—the agency that monitored drug-trafficking into the United States from other countries—grew from 9,000 to 15,000. 11 The Nixon administration determined that the primar y smuggler of heroin into the United States was Auguste Ricord. Consequently, in March 1971 the United States government attempted to extradite Auguste Ricord fr om Paraguay, but there was a breakdown in protocols and it did not happen; 12 although Ricord remained in jail in Paraguay. Over the next year and a half, Nixon turn ed up the heat on Paraguay to release Ricord to the United States. On June 14, 19 71 Nixon met with ambassadors to all countries that grew opium poppies or converted opium gum to morphine and morphine to heroin. He had called them home to impr ess upon them the seriousness of the situation and to order each of them to make heroin a daily, personal, and official concern. Nixon advised the team of ambassa dors in the \"problem countries\" to influence, even exert pressure on, the heads of sta te to help break up the international heroin cartel. 13 In effect, the US ambassadors became Nixon’s foot s oldiers on his war against heroin. 14 Under his leadership, US Customs and narcotics age nts were encouraged to \"exploit\" investigative techniques of Latin and Eur opean countries that were legally unacceptable in the United States. Such practices i ncluded unauthorized wiretaps, bugging, even torture. In other words, the US agent s did not use these techniques themselves, but they would not discourage other cou ntries from acquiring information by whatever means was acceptable. This approach all owed US agents to be somewhat agressive in building a case against Ricord as a ci tizen of Paraguay, but without violating his rights in the United States after he was arrested, extradited, and prosecuted. 15 In September 1971, a newly created Cabinet Committe e on International Narcotics Control held its first formal meeting in the White House. It was chaired by Attorney General John Mitchell, the secretaries of Defense, Treasury, and Agriculture; and the Director of the CIA. The committee fought the war o n heroin through diplomatic channels. Their objective was to convince heads of state—through pressure from US ambassadors—that President Nixon was serious about stopping the flow of heroin into the United States. 16 On July 4, 1972 the American Embassy in Asuncion, P araguay did not hold an Independence Day party for the Paraguayan officials . This had been an annual tradition for 111 years. Nixon’s message was loud a nd clear: Send us Ricord. 17 Around this time the Cabinet Committee on Internati onal Narcotics Control held another meeting to discuss the Ricord case, the con tinuing difficulties with drug smuggling from Panama, and similar problems in Thai land, Burma. 18 It is significant that the Committee was discussing two countries tha t make up the Golden Triangle. In September 1972 the government of Paraguay announ ced they would extradite Ricord to the United States to face prosecution for heroin trafficking. 19 "},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":" 227 On December 16, 1972 Auguste Ricord was convicted o f conspiring to smuggle narcotics into the United States. 20 On January 29, 1973 Ricord was sentenced to 20 years in prison and fined $25,000. 21 On July 1, 1973, President Richard Nixon created th e Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) by merging its predecessor age ncy, the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) with various law enforce ment and intelligence gathering agencies. DEA has been charged with the r esponsibility of enforcing the nation's federal drug laws and works closely with l ocal, state, federal and international law enforcement organizations to identify, target a nd bring to justice the most significant drug traffickers in the world. 22 Dealing With Israel When President Nixon took office in January 1969, L evi Eshkol was prime minister of Israel and was head of the Labour party. ( Footnote 45 ) Eshkol had been prime minister since June 16, 1963 after David Ben-Gurion stepped down from that position. Consequently, Eshkol was Israel’s prime minister wh en President Kennedy was assassinated. He was also prime minister during the Six Day War, during Johnson’s escalation of the Vietnam War and during the assass inations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King. On February 26, 1969, Eshkol di ed in office. He was replaced by Golda Meir, foreign minister to Eshkol and Ben-Guri on. Meir had also been a member Histadrut ( Footnote 46 ) since she and her husband migrated to Palestine fr om Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1921. Her real name was Gol die Mabovitch, later Goldie Myerson, finally changed (Hebraized) to Golda Meir. 23 As Prime Minister, Meir headed the Labour party. During Nixon’s first term, he was not indebted to I srael or its allies in America for winning the election. Most of the American Jewish c ommunity had supported Democratic candidate Hubert Humphrey in the 1968 pr esidential race. 24 According to Henry Kissinger, Nixon often boasted to collegues t hat the \"Jewish lobby\" had no power over him. 25 Initially, Nixon felt that National Security Adviso r Henry Kissinger’s Jewish background disqualified him from deep involvement i n Middle Eastern affairs. Consequently, Nixon gave those responsibilities to his first Secretary of State William Rogers. Around the time of the Watergate burglary, June of 1972, a power struggle developed between Kissinger and Rogers. ( Footnote 47 ) Ultimately Kissinger won and replaced Rogers as secretary of state in the fall o f 1973. Kissinger was completely pro-Israel whereas Rogers had been even-handed and was liked by the Arabs but disliked by Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir. 26 Nixon was distrustful of Jewish political influence s within American politics. He made the following observations in his memoirs: One of the main problems I faced...was the unyielding and shortsighted pro-Israel attitude in large and influ ential segments"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":" 228 of the American Jewish community, Congress, the med ia and in intellectual and cultural circles. In the quarter c entury since the end of World War II this attitude had become so dee ply ingrained that many saw the corollary of not being pro-Israel as being anti- Israeli, or even anti-Semitic. I tried unsuccessful ly to convince them that this was not the case. 27 In addition, both Nixon and Kissinger made the mist ake of approaching Middle East issues within the framework of the Cold War. Nixon might have been more effective had he viewed Arab-Israeli problems as an ongoing r egional conflict which ultimately entangled both America and the Soviet Union. 28 The War of Attritution (1969-70) The years 1969 through 1970 was a period in which t he Egyptians tried unsuccessfully to pressure Israel and the United St ates into implementing UN Resolution 242 29 (reference Chapter 10 for text of the Resolution). The high point of this period was marked by a direct clash between So viet personnel and the Israeli Defense Forces. This conflict was the result of Egy pt’s humiliating defeat in the Six Day War combined with Israel's flaunting of its mil itary might at the Egyptians. 30 In late 1968, Egypt began shelling IDF troops regul arly. Israel responded by firing back, plus it built a fortified defense across the east bank of the Suez Canal. To minimize casualties from Egyptian fire, Israel laun ched massive bombing raids that extended to deep penetrations of Egyptian air space . At the end of the year, Defense Minister Moshe Dayan boasted that Israel had destro yed twenty-four missile sites, an estimated one third of Egypt’s front-line combat pl anes. Rubbing salt in the wound, Israel’s pilots flagrantly displayed their air supe riority by creating sonic booms to shatter windows in Cairo. 31 Nasser requested military aid from the Soviet Union , and in January 1970, the Soviets furnished him with a powerful air defense system. B y March 17, 1970, Soviet troops in Egypt were armed with an assortment of impressiv e weapons, including SA-2s. On the same day, it was announced that 1,500 Soviet te chnicians and a stockpile of SAM- 3 missiles—weapons not even supplied to North Vietn am by the Soviets—had arrived in Egypt. By April 24th, a month later, 10,000 Sovi et technicians were in Egypt and Egyptian planes planes were being flown into combat by Soviet pilots. The Nixon administration was soon under political pressure to counter the Soviets by supplying Israel with 125 additional fighter planes; however, diplomatic avenues were explored instead. 32 UN Resolution 242 was discussed again but no genuin e effort was made to enforce it. In August 1970, a flawed cease-fire agreement betwe en Egypt and Israel went into effect. But five Israeli Phantoms were soon shot do wn over Egypt by Soviet missiles. Israel complained, but the reality was the cease-fi re agreement had been violated by both sides. Neither the Soviets or the Egyptians we re supposed to shoot at Israeli"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":" 229 planes, but the Israeli Phantoms had no business be ing in Egypt’s airspace in the first place. 33 In a sense, Israel had been paid back for flaunting its military might over Egypt; however, the Israelis used the truce violations as a pretext for avoiding discussions that might force them to return land acquired in th e Six Day War. 34 The Jordanian Crisis (June to September 1970) The PLO had built a large private army for raids on Israel and was involved in attempts to assassinate King Hussein. On September 5, 1970, an extremist group known as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Pa lestine (PFLP) hijacked three airliners (American, Swiss, and British) and landed them in a small airfield in Amman, Jordan. Over three hundred passengers were held hos tage before the planes were destroyed. King Hussein wanted to crush the terrori sts, but feared such an action might draw Iraq and Syria into the conflict, thereb y escalating the overall situation. At America’s encouragement, Israel launched air strike s against Syria while Jordanian forces crushed the PFLP guerrillas. 35 Nixon increased American aid to Israel in 1971. Som e believe he was rewarding Israel for its assistance with the PFLP hijackers, but he may have used that incident as a pretext to buy off Israel (reference the first po int of Nixon’s eight point plan to end the Vietnam War.) As previously stated, he gave Isr ael about $1.61 billion from 1971 through 1973. That was a huge increase—approximatel y the same amount the United States had given Israel over its entire 22 year his tory (from 1948 through 1970). 36 In retrospect, however, Israel did not really deserve such a huge reward because it acted primarily out of self interest. Syria was one of Is rael’s most dangerous enemies, and it was to Israel’s interest to eliminate a Syrian-domi nated radical regime in Amman, Jordan. Surely Nixon understood that. ( Footnote 48 ) The Death of Nasser—Replaced by Sadat (1970) On September 28, 1970, President Nasser died sudden ly and unexpectedly. ( Footnote 49 ) His successor, General Anwar el-Sadat was not widel y known outside his own country. The political experts did not expect him t o do much right away, put he surprised them by suddenly trying to switch backers ; preferring the United States over Russia. Sadat was under heavy political pressure in ternally to recover land from Israel or risk being overthrown. For some reason, Henry Ki ssinger ignored Sadat’s efforts to switch sides. 37 Assisted by American representatives in Cairo, Sada t drafted a peace proposal and submitted it to the Nixon administration. He had be en led to believe that it would meet America’s approval. At this point, the Nixon g overnment was under heavy Israeli influence, and Sadat’s proposal was promptl y rejected at Israel’s direction. In May 1971 Sadat was left with no alternative but to maintain his friendship with the Soviets. Consequently, he signed a friendship agree ment with them. 38 "},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":" 230 Nevertheless, Sadat was not happy with the Soviet U nion. He wanted more arms in order to take back his land, but the Soviets did no t want to fight Israel and they wanted to avoid a confrontation with the United Sta tes. In May 1972, at the Moscow Conference, Sadat concluded that the Soviet Union h ad completely reneged on its promises to recover Egypt’s seized territories. Con sequently, he expelled his Soviet advisers, and in February 1973 sent a private emiss ary to Kissinger to discuss a United States-brokered deal. Sadat’s efforts were l ess than fruitful because Nixon was pre-occupied with the Watergate scandal at that tim e. 39 After Nixon’s re-election in 1972, his Middle Easte rn policy was in effect—though not stated—to continue nurturing Israel’s military so that prime minister Golda Meir could continue her expansion agenda. Israel continu ed using its powerful political influence in America to pressure Congress. By March 1, 1973, Nixon agreed to supply new airplanes and even authorized plans for co-manufacturing of aircraft in Israel. 40 The Yom Kippur War (Oct. 6, 1973) On October 6, 1973 (Yom Kippur), Egypt launched a m assive attack on Israel. Egyptian forces swiftly crossed the Suez Canal and occupied the entire east bank. Within two days, the Israelis lost fifty aircraft a nd hundreds of tanks. The United States and Israel were caught completely off guard. On October 9th, Israel launched a counterattack and halted the Egyptian onslaught. 41 In the years immediately following the Six Day War, the Soviets had helped Egypt assemble one of the most substantial missile walls in the world. Also, to avert an air offensive from the Israel Air Force deep within Egy pt, the Soviets furnished Egypt with SCUD surface-to-surface missiles with a 180-mi le range. With the delivery of the first SCUD in April 1973, Sadat decided to laun ch the attack. He was assisted by President Assad of Syria who simultaneously attacke d Israel’s northern border. 42 Sadat organized the attack because he was under hea vy political pressure to provide even a small military success to compensate for the humiliating defeat of the Six Day War in 1967. In fact, he managed to thwart a coup d ’état supported by the Soviets. In planning the attack, Sadat’s primary objective was not merely to recover lost territories, but to burst the bubble of leaders in Washington and Jerusalem who believed Israel could continue its annexation progr am with impunity. To a large degree, the Yom Kippur War achieved that goal. 43 The emotional impact of the Yom Kippur War was cons iderable. Israel’s casualties were extensive; its vision of an boundless enlargem ent of kingdom had been given an abrupt shock. The discovery that Arabs could in fac t fight with courage and efficiency was most unsettling. 44 UN Cease-Fire (Oct. 22, 1973)"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":" 231 A UN cease-fire order was issued on October 22, 197 3; however, Israel quickly ignored it. They attempted to surround the Egyptian Third Army and starve it into surrender. The United States demanded that all part ies abide by the UN cease-fire, otherwise America would intervene and provide food to the Egyptian troops. During the cease-fire negotiations, the Israelis de manded more military support and threatened a negative publicity campaign toward the US government for joining the Soviet Union in imposing peace conditions to Israel . The United States mildly subdued its displeasure and tried to appease Israel by providing the extra planes and tanks requested. 45 The Geneva Conference (1973) In September 1973 President Nixon appointed Henry K issinger as Secretary of State, 46 thereby replacing William Rogers. To resolve the Y om Kippur War, the UN passed Resolution 338 which called for a cease-fire between Israel and Egypt, prescribed implementation of UN Resolution 242, and urged additional peace talks at Geneva. The following is the complete text of UN Re solution 338: The Security Council 1. Calls upon all parties to the present fighting to cease all firing and terminate all military activity immediat ely, no later than 12 hours after the moment of the adoptio n of this decision, in the positions they now occupy; 2. Calls upon the parties concerned to start immediat ely after the ceasefire the implementation of Security Counci l resolution 242 (1967) in all of its parts; 3. Decides that, immediately and concurrently with th e ceasefire, negotiations start between the parties concerned under appropriate auspices aimed at establishing a just and durable peace in the Middle East. (UN Security Council Resolution 338, October 22, 19 73) The United States had lukewarm support for Resoluti on 338 ( Footnote 50 ) and its call for a Geneva Conference, although Kissinger was obliged—a s secretary of state—to give observers the impression that he was trying to adhe re to it. 47 President Hafez Assad, head of Syria since 1970 and head of the Ba’ath Socialist Party, had no interest in the Geneva Conference unl ess Kissinger agreed to answer the following three questions: 1. Did the United States agree with Syria that Syri a should not give up any of its territory?"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":" 232 2. Did the United States agree that there could be no solution unless the Palestinian problem was solved? 3. Was the United States going to Geneva with an ob jective consonant with those points, or only to engage in t he usual obfuscations before breaking up the conference with out having achieved anything? 48 Syria’s three questions put Kissinger in an awkward position. If he agreed with the first point, that Syria should not give up any terr itory; this would upset Israel. If he agreed with the second point, that the Palestinian problem should be solved before peace talks with Israel could begin; Israel would d efinitely be displeased. On the other hand, if Kissinger supported Israel’s efforts to an nex the Golan and refused to include the Palestinians, the Arabs would walk away from th e peace talks. Kissinger more or less evaded the issue and merely gave President Ass ad unspecific support. 49 Gold Meir made Kissinger’s job even more difficult by insisting that the Palestinians not be mentioned at all in Geneva and that the Unit ed Nations participation would be limited exclusively to facilitating the conference, and nothing more. 50 Kissinger managed to negotiate a preliminary agreem ent between Egypt and Israel; 51 however, the Arabs were dissatisfied with his attit ude toward Syria’s three points. This created solidarity among the oil-producing Ara b nations. Consequently, they imposed an oil embargo on the United States through the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC). This had a d ramatic effect on the American culture and economy. 52 Arab Oil Embargo (1973) OAPEC was created in January 1968. The Chairmanship rotates annually. Member countries include Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, L ibya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and United Arab Emirates. 53 As previously stated, the Arab oil embargo was the result of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger’s efforts—in the wake of the Yom Kippur War (1973)—to resolve Arab-Israeli conflicts at a peace conference in Geneva per UN Resolution 338. The OAPEC countries imposed the emb argo which led to a quadrupling of oil prices. The aftershock produced runaway inflation and a recession. 54 Few politicians had the courage to publicly critici ze America’s support of Israel as the root cause of the Arab oil embargo. Instead our lea ders took a more convenient route of blaming Arabs and engaging in racism toward Musl ims at large. The OAPEC nations refused to end the embargo until the United States worked out a peace agreement between Israel and Syria. Kissinger ’s job was made more difficult by Israel’s demand that Syria free its jailed Israe li prisoners. To neutralize that demand, Kissinger suggested that both countries—Syr ia and Israel—provide the other"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":" 233 with a list jailed prisoners to be released. Once b oth sides agreed on the lists of names, the peace negotiations would begin. 55 Israel and Syria provided the requested list of nam es, but peace negotiations quickly deteriorated because Israel was simply unwilling to give up any land to Syria. A squabble developed over the former provincial capit al of the Golan Heights, Quneitra, an uninhabited market town with a population once e stimated at between 20,000 and 50,000 people. Syria had evacuated the town at the end of the Six Day War. In the final hours of the truce, Israeli forces drove out the remaining civilian population and destroyed the town, leaving it uninhabitable; howev er, this fact was not known to the Syrians during the 1973 negotiations between Israel and Sryia. Consequently, Israel stalled and complained about the negotiations becau se they did not want to acknowledge destroying the town of Quneitra in 1967 . 56 As a diversion, Israel launched a raid into Lebanon which prompted a Palestinian guerrilla attack on the Israeli town of Ma’a lot. H ostages were seized. In the end, sixteen schoolchildren and three guerrillas were ki lled. The possibility of genuine peace evaporated with that tragic event; however, b oth Syria and Israel signed a peace plan on May 18, 1974 to end the fighting. This also diffused the Arab oil embargo. Rethinking Nixon It appears that President Nixon may have been more courageous than many realize. Although he resigned in disgrace over the Watergate scandal, he did some things that the public seldom reads or hears about, at least no t in full context. The following is a list of major accomplishments: \u0001 He established détente, in May 1972, between the Un ited States and the Soviet Union with the signing of the SALT I agreements. Fo r all intents and purposes, this marked the end of the Cold War. \u0001 He opened diplomatic relations with China. \u0001 He withdrew American forces from South Vietnam and ended the draft. Half a million American soldiers were abandoned on foreign soil by President Johnson when he abdicated his leadership in March 1 968. Nixon brought them home. \u0001 He greatly curtailed the flow of heroin into US bor ders by crushing Auguste Ricord’s heroin cartel. \u0001 He encouraged the public execution of Lucien Sarti— the French-Corsican assassin who reportedly killed President Kennedy by shooting him in the right temple with an exploding bullet—by Mexican police i n Mexico City on April 27, 1972 (about six weeks before the Watergate burg lary). In light of these things, a different image of Nixo n unfolds, and Watergate has new dimensions—likely a bloodless coup. To evaluate Nix on fairly, one must consider the times in which he served as President. He took offi ce just six years after President Kennedy was assassinated. And Kennedy’s successor, Lyndon Johnson, had quickly escalated US involvement in the Vietnam War. Within four years, Johnson had escalated the number of military personnel in South Vietnam from 16,000 to 540,000."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":" 234 After turning a small conflict into a major war, Jo hnson abdicated his leadership in March of 1968. Within days, Martin Luther King was assassinated. On June 5, 1968, Robert Kennedy was assassinated. Both men were advo cating a quick withdrawal of troops from Vietnam. The Nixon Administration is still most heavily crit icized for its \"secret\" bombing campaign in Cambodia. But as he explained in a spee ch before the VFW in New Orleans on August 20, 1973, the action was not a se cret within the government as his critics had charged. Nixon explained that the plan was \"disclosed to appropriate Government leaders\" and the \"appropriate Congressio nal leaders.\" He added that \"there was no secrecy as far as Government leaders were concerned, who had any right to know or need to know.\" It is also importan t to realize that Nixon had only been President for less than two months when that d ecision was made. Upon reflection, it appears that the so-called \"secret\" bombing campaign in Cambodia was actually Nixon’s Bay of Pigs. Eventually his enemie s used that decision—which many of them participated in—as one of several reas ons why he should be driven from office. Within this context, many of Nixon’s actions regard ing China, the Soviet Union, Vietnam, and the war on heroin were indeed bold and courageous. Endnotes 1.

In this chapter, I will set aside religious beliefs and focus on the ancient conflict between Jews and Christians by first analyzing passages from the Bible and the Talmud, then exploring the histor ical and political implications. It is not my intention to claim that Christianity is bett er than Judaism. To the contrary, I will show that many aspects of Christianity have st rayed dramatically from the teachings of Jesus through the misguided interpreta tion of the self-appointed Apostle Paul, a Pharisee. Although Jesus preached to love o ur enemies, he made it abundantly clear that the Pharisees were in fact his enemies. The Pharisaic sect of Judaism no longer exists per se, but its teachings have become the mainstay of modern Judaism through Pharisaic te achings documented in the Talmud. In AD 200, the teachings of the Pharisees o n Jewish law were incorporated in the Mishna which became the first volume of the Talmud. 1 The Talmud—a set of 63 books written by ancient rabbis—contains the leg al code which is the basis of Judaism and Jewish law. It was edited centuries aft er the birth of Jesus and is the textbook used to train rabbis. 2 Persecution of Jews Jews were expelled from virtually every country in Western Europe from 1290 through 1551. During this time the Catholic Church instituted the Inquisition to combat heresy throughout Europe. In 1478 Pope Sixtu s IV authorized the well-known Spanish Inquisition which resulted in the burning o f about 2,000 people at the stake and the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492. 3 In general, Jews were accused of the following offenses: \u0001 Continual lying and treacherous behavior \u0001 Practicing witchcraft \u0001 Blasphemous ridicule of Jesus Much to my surprise, after studying the Talmud and various historical sources, I have concluded that the stated offenses are promoted und er Talmudic law. The first offense—continual lying and treacherous b ehavior—is encouraged through the annual recitation of an ancient Jewish prayer, the Kol Nidre, which frees Jews from fulfilling vows taken throughout the ensuing y ear. The Kol Nidre is widely known among Jews because it is recited—sung to a me lody—on the eve of Yom Kippur. Typically the song is sung as part of the t emple’s service and Jews respond by making the following declaration which is written i n the Talmud book of Nedarim: Every vow which I may make in the future shall be n ull."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":" 237 (Talmud, Nedarim, 23a) The Kol Nidre is good for a year. Therefore it must be restated annually on the eve of Yom Kippur. Apologists for the Kol Nidre abound. Th e popular explanation is that it applies only to vows made to God. The rationale is that in the Middle Ages, Jews were forced to take Christian vows. The Kol Nidre w as intended—we are told—to give oppressed Jews a way of voiding such vows made to God under duress. This explanation sounds good, but it does not match the Talmud’s rationale. The following is a full description of the Kol Nidre prayer as wr itten in the Talmud book of Nedarim: He who desires his friend to eat with him, and afte r urging him, imposes a vow upon him, it is ‘a vow of incitement’ and hence invalid. And he who desires that none of his vows m ade during the year shall be valid, let him stand at the begin ning of the year and declare, \"Every vow which I may make in the fut ure shall be null.\" HIS VOWS ARE THEN INVALID, PROVIDING THAT HE REMEMBERS THIS AT THE TIME OF THE VOW. (Caps in original.) (Talmud, Nedarim, 23a) Clearly, the practice of breaking vows is intended for vows made to humans, not to God. The Talmud specifically states that \"He who de sires his friend to eat with him, and after urging him, imposes a vow upon him, it is ‘a vow of incitement’ and hence invalid.\" In other words, if two businessmen have l unch together—one is a Jew, one is a Christian—and the Christian gets the Jew to agree to a specific business deal (which is a vow), then the Jew is not bound to honor the t erms of the business deal because it is a \"vow of incitement\" and therefore invalid. Thi s explains why Jewish leaders in Israel rarely honor the terms of Arab-Israeli peace treaties, cease-fire truces, or border agreements. The late Benjamin Freedman ( Footnote 51 ) described the Kol Nidre in a speech he delivered in Washington, DC in 1961. The following text is an excerpt from that speech: Do you know what Jews do on the Day of Atonement, t hat you think is so sacred to them? I was one of them. This is not hearsay. I'm not here to be a rabble-rouser. I'm he re to give you facts. When, on the Day of Atonement, you walk into a synagogue, you stand up for the very first prayer t hat you recite. It is the only prayer for which you stand. You repe at three times a short prayer called the Kol Nidre. In that prayer, you enter into an agreement with God Almighty that any oath, vow, or pledge that you may make during the next twelve months shall be null and void. The oath shall not be an oath; the vow shall not be a vow; the pledge shall not be a pledge. They shall have n o force or effect. And further, the Talmud teaches that whenev er you take an oath, vow, or pledge, you are to remember the Ko l Nidre"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":" 238 prayer that you recited on the Day of Atonement, an d you are exempted from fulfilling them. How much can you dep end on their loyalty? ... (Benjamin Freedman, excerpt form a speech at the Wi llard Hotel in Washington, DC, 1961) For Gentile readers interested in hearing the Kol N idre’s melody, go to a video store and rent The Jazz Singer ( Footnote 52 ) starring Al Jolson. In the movie, Jolson gave a stirring rendition of Mammy and the Kol Nidre. The second offense—practicing witchcraft—receives t acit endorsement in the Talmud. The following passage clearly states that some form s of sorcery are entirely permitted, while others are exempt from punishment, yet forbid den, and others are punished by death. The following text is from the Talmud book o f Sanhedrin: Abaye said: The laws of sorcerers are like those of the Sabbath: certain actions are punished by stoning, some are e xempt from punishment, yet forbidden, whilst others are entire ly permitted. Thus: if one actually performs magic, he is stoned; if he merely creates an illusion, he is exempt, yet it is forbid den; whilst what is entirely permitted? — Such as was performed by R. H anina and R. Oshaia, who spent every Sabbath eve in studying the Laws of Creation, by means of which they created a third-gr own calf and ate it. (Talmud, Sanhedrin 67b) The Talmud further reveals a specific instance wher e an ancient Rabbi—in around AD 200 ( Footnote 53 ) —tried and executed other Jews in Palestine for pra cticing witchcraft just as the Catholic Church did centuries later in Europe during the Inquisition. The Rabbi’s name was \"Simeon B. Shetah.\" He hanged 80 w omen in the city of Askelon, located on the Mediterranean Coast of Palestine, fo r practicing witchcraft at an \"alarming rate.\" Ironically, Rabbis later commented in the Talmud that the executions were illegal—not because they were inhumane or crue l, but because two defendants must not be tried on the same day. The following te xt is from the Talmud book of Sanhedrin: MISHNAH. ALL WHO ARE STONED ARE [AFTERWARDS] HANGED: THIS IS R. ELIEZER'S VIEW, THE SAGES SAY: ONLY THE BLASPHEMER AND THE IDOLATER ARE HANGED. A MAN IS HANGED WITH HIS FACE TOWARDS THE SPECTATORS, BUT A WOMAN WITH HER FACE TOWARDS THE GALLOWS: THIS IS THE VIEW OF R. ELIEZER. BUT THE SAGES SAY: A MAN IS HANGED, BUT NOT A WOMAN. WHEREUPON R. ELIEZER SAID TO THEM: BUT DID NOT SIMEON B. SHETAH HANG WOMEN AT ASHKELON?

Witch craft amongst Jewish women prevailed at that time to an alarming extent, and in order to prevent a combined effort on the part of t heir relations to rescue the culprits, he had to execute all of them at once. He hanged them, then, to prevent such practices and to avoid rescue, but his action is no precedent, and in itse lf was actually illegal, as the Sages pointed out. (Talmud, Sanhedrin 45b) The third offense—blasphemous ridicule of Jesus—app ears to be quite valid. The Talmud makes about sixty references to an apparent alias for Jesus: \"Balaam.\" Most references to Balaam are extremely hateful and ofte n vulgar. The Talmud itself discloses that some people believe Balaam is an ali as for Jesus, and Phinehas the Robber is an alias for Pontius Pilate. The followin g text is from the Talmud book of Sanhedrin: (6) According to the view that all the Balaam passa ges are anti- Christian in tendency, Balaam being used as an alia s for Jesus, Phinehas the Robber is thus taken to represent Pont ius Pilatus, and the Chronicle of Balaam probably to denote a Go spel (v. Herford op. cit. 72ff.). This view is however dispu ted by Bacher and others: cf. Ginzberg, Journal of Biblical Liter ature, XLI, 121. (Talmud, Sanhedrin 106b) The Talmud further discloses that Balaam was thirty years old when Phinehas the Robber killed him: A certain min ( Footnote 54 ) said to R. Hanina: Hast thou heard how old Balaam was? — He replied: It is not actually st ated, but since it is written, Bloody and deceitful men shall not l ive out half their days, [it follows that] he was thirty-three or thir ty-four years old. He rejoined: Thou hast said correctly; I personally have seen Balaam's Chronicle, ( Footnote 55 ) in which it is stated, ‘Balaam the lame was thirty years old when Phinehas the Robber killed him.’ Mar, the son of Rabina, said to his sons: In the ca se of all [those mentioned as having no portion in the future world] you should not take [the Biblical passages dealing with them] to expound them [to their discredit], excepting in the case of the wicked Balaam: whatever you find [written] about him, lect ure upon it [to"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":" 240 his disadvantage]. (Talmud, Sanhedrin 106b) The last sentence, \"lecture upon it to his advantag e,\" appears to be an instruction to Rabbis to actively teach in opposition of Jesus and Christianity. When the Mishna (the first of the 63 books of the T almud) was compiled in around AD 200, it incorporated the teachings of the Pharis ees on Jewish law. This is what the Mishna states about Balaam: MISHNAH 19. WHOEVER POSSESSES THESE THREE THINGS, HE IS OF THE DISCIPLES OF ABRAHAM, OUR FATHER; AND [WHOEVER POSSESSES] THREE OTHER THINGS, HE IS OF THE DISCIPLES OF BALAAM, THE WICKED. THE DISCIPLES OF ABRAHAM, OUR FATHER, [POSSESS] A GOOD EYE, AN HUMBLE SPIRIT AND A LOWLY SOUL. THE DISCIPLES OF BALAAM, THE WICKED, [POSSESS] AN EVIL EYE, A HAUGHTY SPIRIT AND AN OVER-AMBITIOUS SOUL. WHAT IS [THE DIFFERENCE] BETWEEN THE DISCIPLES OF ABRAHAM, OUR FATHER, AND THE DISCIPLES OF BALAAM, THE WICKED. THE DISCIPLES OF ABRAHAM, OUR FATHER, ENJOY [THEIR SHARE] IN THIS WORLD, AND INHERIT THE WORLD TO COME, AS IT IS SAID: THAT I MAY CAUSE THOSE THAT LOVE ME TO INHERIT SUBSTANCE AND THAT I MAY FILL THEIR TREASURIES, BUT THE DISCIPLES OF BALAAM, THE WICKED, INHERIT GEHINNOM, AND DESCEND INTO THE NETHERMOST PIT, AS IT IS SAID: BUT THOU, O GOD, WIL T BRING THEM DOWN TO THE NETHERMOST PIT; MEN OF BLOOD AND DECEIT SHALL NOT LIVE OUT HALF THEIR DAYS; BUT AS FOR ME, I WILL TRUST IN THEE. (Mishna, Avoth Chapter 5) Reference Appendix C for a summarized listing of anti-Christian passage s from the uncensored version of the Talmud. An additional offense—blood libel (the ritualistic sacrifice of children)—is obviously the most controversial, but it appears to have a hi storical basis. On November 16, 1491, five men were executed at Avila for the ritua listic murder of a four-year-old Christian boy (later known as the \"Holy Child of La Guardia\"). Two of the men were Jews, the other three were \"conversos\"—Sephardic Je ws who converted to Christianity. The boy’s heart was reportedly cut ou t and used with two stolen consecrated hosts in a ritual of black magic agains t the Christians. For centuries the case was tainted because the five executed men had been tortured prior to confessing. But in 1931, historian William Thomas Walsh offered persuasive"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":" 241 evidence in his book, Isabella of Spain , that the charge of blood libel was in fact true. Walsh found the testimony of a Jew who stated that he witnessed the crime, and had not been subjected to torture. Although the Spanish Inquisition was already underway, it was ritualistic murder of the young boy that res ulted in expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492. It was the last straw. Before the executions, two independent judicial pan els had reviewed and confirmed the Inquisition’s findings. 4 On November 24, 1805, the murdered boy was canoniz ed as St. Christopher on the authority of Pope Pius VI I. Jesus Warned Against Pharisaic Rule The Talmud teaches Rabbis to oppose and discredit t he teachings of Jesus because he criticized the Pharisees. As previously stated, Pha risaic law is reflected in the Talmud, particularly in the book of Mishna—the original boo k of the Talmud. Here are a few examples of Jesus’s words of contemp t towards the Pharisees from the book of Matthew, Chapter 23 (King James edition): (26) Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also. (27) Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye are like unto whited sepulchres [burial vaults], which indeed app ear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones, a nd all uncleanness. (28) Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and i niquity. (29) Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Be cause ye build tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulc hres of the righteous. (30) And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the b lood of the prophets. (31) Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yours elves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophe ts. (32) Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. (33) Ye serpen ts, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnati on of hell? (34) Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, a nd wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and cru cify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and pe rsecute them from city to city: (35) That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. (36) Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation. (37) O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and ston est them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens unde r her wings, and ye would not!

(The words of Jesus: King James Bible, Matthew, Cha pter 23) Even the well-known \"render unto Caesar\" passage wa s instigated by the Pharisees. Here is a reminder: (15) Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk. (16) And they sent out un to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master we kno w that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, nei ther, carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of m en. (17) Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to g ive tribute unto Caesar, or not? (18) But Jesus perceived their wick edness, and said, ‘Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?’ (19) ‘Show me the tribute money.’ And they brought unto him a penny. (20) And he saith unto them, ‘Whose is this image and superscri ption?’ (21) They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto the m, ‘Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s ; and unto God the things that are God’s.’ (22) When they had heard of these words, they marvelled, and left him and went their way. (King James Bible, Matthew, Chapter 22) Balaam: References in Bible and Talmud As previously stated, the Talmud apparently uses \"B alaam\" as an alias for Jesus. It is also worth noting that Bible mentions Balaam severa l times as well, particularly in the Old Testament book of Numbers, Chapters 22 - 24. In fact, there is an interesting story about Balaam in the Bible (Numbers 22:20 - 22 :35) that is remarkably similar to a reference of Balaam in the Talmud (Sanhedrin 105a , 105b). The two passages must have originated from the same source because the sentence structures and word choices in the two sections are too similar to be coincidence; however, two different stories are told. The Biblic al reference depicts Balaam as a protector of the Israelites, whereas, the Talmudic reference depicts him as one who commits bestiality. It makes no sense for the Talmud to view Balaam wit h contempt, often referring to him as the \"wicked Balaam.\" Such contempt for a man who protected the Israelites further supports the belief that Balaam is in fact a Talmudic alias for Jesus. In the Biblical reference, Balaam’s donkey spoke to him as he traveled to the city of Moab to meet with its King, Balak. The king had sol icited Balaam to put a curse on the Israelites camped ominously on the plains of Mo ab. While en route to Moab, an angel appeared but only Balaam’s donkey could see i t. The donkey stopped, and"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":" 243 Balaam struck the animal to get it to continue. Aft er three blows, the Lord spoke to Balaam through the donkey’s mouth. The beast warned Balaam that he should not put a curse on the Jews for King Balak. Balaam took hee d of the advice and hence became a protector of the Israelites. The Talmudic reference to Balaam’s talking donkey m akes a vulgar assertion that Balaam committed bestiality with the animal—a sin p unishable by death under Talmudic law. Here is the Biblical reference to the words spoken by Balaam’s donkey: [30] And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine a ss, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? Was I ever wont to do so unto thee? (King James Bible, Numbers 22:30) Here is the Talmudic reference to the words spoken by Balaam’s donkey: But the ass said to [Balaam], ‘Am I not thine ass?’ — ‘Merely for carrying loads’, [he replied]. ‘Upon which thou has t ridden.’ — ‘That was only by chance.’ ‘Ever since I was thine until this day,’ [she added]. ‘Moreover, I serve thee as a companion by night.’ (Talmud, Sanhedrin 105a, 105b) The Talmudic reference to the talking donkey appear s to be a distortion of the Biblical account. Both accounts state that the donkey made t he following statement: \"Ever since I was thine until this day.\" But the Talmud a dded the following reference to bestiality: \"Moreover, I serve thee as a companion by night.\" Here is the Talmudic reference in full context wher e it clearly states that Balaam committed bestiality: R. Johanan said: Balaam limped on one foot, as it i s written, And he walked haltingly. Samson was lame in both feet, as it is written, [Dan shall be a serpent by the way,] an ad der in the path that biteth the horse's heels. Balaam was blind in one eye, as it is said, [and the man] whose eye is open . . . He prac tised enchantment by means of his membrum. ( Footnote 56 ) For here it is written, falling, but having his eyes open; whilst elsewhere is written, And Haman was fallen on the bed whereon Es ther was. It was stated, Mar Zutra said: He practised enchant ment by means of his membrum. Mar the son of Rabina said: H e committed bestiality with his ass.

In addition, he performed miracles which was viewed by the Pharisees as magic—a form of sorcery punishable by death under Jewish law. When the Pharisees learned that Jesus had reportedly rai sed Lazarus from the dead, the Sanhedrin ( Footnote 57 ) decided to take action. They plotted to kill him. The high priest of the Sanhedrin at that time was J oseph Caiaphas. He was the man who ordered the death of Jesus, although the deed w as officially carried out by Roman Governor Pontius Pilate. ( Footnote 58 ) Caiaphas was the last priest to interrogate Jesus before delivering him to Pilate for a formal inquisition and subsequent crucifixion. Assisting Caiaphas in the interrogatio n of Jesus was his father-in-law, Ananus, who also had served as the previous high-pr iest of the Sanhedrin."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":" 245 According to the ancient Jewish historian Flavius J osephus (AD 37/38 - 100), Caiaphas was appointed high-priest and official hea d of the Sanhedrin by Roman Governor Valerius Gratus around AD 18. Caiaphas hel d that position for about 18 years until he was replaced in AD 36. Governor Grat us was the predecessor of Pontius Pilate. 5 Pilate was appointed Governor around AD 26, stayed for ten years, then was ordered back to Rome by Vitellius in AD 36 to appear before the Emperor Tiberius regarding complaints made against him by t he Jews; however, Tiberius died before Pilate reached Rome. 6 Shortly thereafter (AD 36), Vitellius took over as Governor and immediately removed Caiaphas as high-p riest. Caiaphas was replaced by Jonathan, the son of Ananus. 7 Ananus was the first member of the Sanhedrin to interrogate Jesus after his arrest by the Sanhedrin guards. 8 According to the Gospels, Pilate did not want to ki ll Jesus and was somewhat intimidated by him. Pilate’s wife, Claudia Procula, begged him to leave Jesus alone because she had a bad dream ( Footnote 59 ) about the \"just man.\" 9 But Caiaphas, Ananus and their colleagues at the Sanhedrin had already s pread malicious rumors about Jesus to the crowds that surrounded the Governor’s palace . When Pilate asked the crowd what to do with Jesus, they shouted \"Crucify him!\" 10 Pilate tried to calm the crowd because he did not w ant to kill Jesus. But Caiaphas, Ananus and their colleagues had whipped the crowd i nto such a frenzy that a riot nearly occurred. At that point, Pilate gave in and ordered Jesus to be crucified. Before issuing the order, he publicly washed his hands bef ore the crowd and said, \"I am innocent of the blood of this just person.\" They replied, \"His blood is on us and on our childr en.\" 11 Ironically, according to Josephus, Caiaphas and Pil ate were both replaced in their respective positions of authority within five years after Jesus was crucified. 12 The Bible is quite clear about who bears responsibi lity for Christ’s execution. It was not Pilate. In fact, several Christian churches hav e canonized Pilate’s wife, Claudia Procula, and in some instances even Pilate himself, for their defense of Christ against the Jewish priests. In my research, I have found tw o days, June 25th and October 27th, designated by various Christian churches (Greek Ort hodox, Abyssinian, Coptic) to recognize either St. Pilate, or St. [Claudia] Procu la, or both. Josephus—a non-Christian source—described Jesus in his book, Antiquities of the Jews (AD 93), in a manner remarkably similar to the Gos pels. The following is an excerpt about Jesus: Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man; for he was a doer of wonderful w orks, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleas ure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the G entiles. He was [the] Christ. And when Pilate, at the suggestio n of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake h im; for he appeared to them alive again the third day; as the divine prophets"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":" 246 had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him. And the tribe of Christians, so nam ed from him, are not extinct at this day. (Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews , Book 18, Chapter 3, p. 3) Notice that, according to Josephus, Pilate condemne d Jesus to the cross \"at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us.\" Those men were Joseph Caiaphas, head of the Sanhedrin, and his predecessor and father-in -law, Ananus. The Apostle Paul, a Pharisee, Distorted Jesus’s Mes sage I believe the Apostle Paul was a false prophet work ing for the Pharisees. In fact, he openly boasted of being a Pharisee (Philippians 3:5 ). 13 As previously stated, Jesus was highly critical of the Pharisees. Paul’s mission wa s apparently to water down the teachings of Jesus; however, it should be remembere d that Jesus warned of false prophets in the following passage: [15] Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. [16] Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gat her grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? [17] Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fr uit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. [18] A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, nei ther can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. [19] Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. [20] Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. [21] Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will o f my Father which is in heaven. [22] Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, h ave we not prophesied in thy name? And in thy name have cast o ut devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? [23] And then will I profess unto them, I never kne w you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. (The words of Jesus: King James Bible, Matthew 7:15 - 7:23) The Apostle Paul’s original name was Saul of Tarsus . Initially, Paul was a bitter enemy of Christianity—a Pharisee—then converted and did more than anyone to promote the burgeoning religion. Paul’s message, ho wever, differs substantially from the Gospels. If one examines the letters of Paul, i t becomes clear that he paid little attention to the teachings of Jesus. Instead, Paul focused almost entirely on the"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":" 247 theological aspect of Jesus as the son of God, the crucifixion, the resurrection, and the concept of predestination. Paul was not given any sort of authority by Jesus o r any of his Twelve Apostles to spread the Gospel. This plus the fact that Paul the Apostle was a Pharisee should not be taken lightly. Furthermore, Paul’s view of Jews is somewhat confusing, while Jesus was quite clear and consistent on that topic. Jesus viewed Pharisaic Jews as evil and corrupt. At one point he accused their father o f being the devil, to which the Pharisaic Jews responded by casting stones at him, 14 but he hid to escape their wrath. 15 Throughout the Gospels, there is a constant confli ct between Jesus and the Pharisees. Paul, however, is inconsistent on this i ssue. In some of his writings, he addressed Jews in a loving sense, but in others he addressed them in a hateful, scornful way. For example, Paul wrote poetically of Jews in Galat ians: There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither sl ave nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all o ne in Christ Jesus. (King James Bible, Galatians 3:28) In Thessalonians, Paul was not so poetic when he ac cused the Jews of killing Jesus: [14] For ye, brethren, became followers of the chur ches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also ha ve suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews: [15] Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and ar e contrary to all men: [16] Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that th ey might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost. (King James Bible, Thessalonians 2:14 through 16) Clearly Paul was a skilled writer, but much of his rhetoric makes no sense. Most of the confusing dogma associated with Christianity ca n be attributed to Paul. Here are some examples of Paul’s poetic, but muddled rhetori c about Jesus: For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scri ptures; (King James Bible, 1st Corinthians 15:3) For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":" 248 (King James Bible, Romans 6:23) Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also re ceived us to the glory of God. (King James Bible, Romans 15:7) For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach th e gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ shou ld be made of none effect. (King James Bible, 1st Corinthians 1:17) Notice that Paul created many of the popular phrase s used by Christians today. They include the following: \"Christ died for our sins\".. . \"the wages of sin\"... \"Christ also received us to the glory of God\"... \"the cross of C hrist\"... and so on. In the Gospels, the death and resurrection of Jesus was additional proof that he was in fact the son of God. In my view, the words of Jesus alone are powerful and courageous. Whether we choose to believe that he wa s the son of God is a matter of individual faith. Nevertheless, Jesus was a wise ma n in his own right. But Paul ignored his powerful teachings and focused almost e xclusively on his death and resurrection. Paul took the crucifixion to a comple tely new level which, in my view, weakened the original message substantially. The Ancient Kingdom of Khazaria The notion that Jews are God’s chosen people is not only untrue, but ridiculous. It is a myth that most Jews have an ethnic relationship to Israel. In reality, most Jews have a stronger kinship to the ancient Kingdom of Khazaria than to modern or ancient Palestine/Israel. ( Footnote 60 ) Khazaria was a country in eastern Europe that flou rished as an independent state from about 650 to 1016. In abo ut 740, the king of Khazaria issued a decree whereby the national religion becam e Judaism. Prior to that, the main religion was Shamanism, a type of paganism from whi ch Wicca later evolved. Wicca is a religion of sorts, but is really a euphemism f or witchcraft. In fact, Wiccans openly refer to themselves as witches. In addition, Wiccan s openly acknowledge Shamanism as a \"mother religion.\" Benjamin Freedman described the Khazars in a speech he delivered in Washington, DC in 1961. The following is an excerpt from that s peech: What are the facts about the Jews? (I call them Jew s to you, because they are known as Jews. I don't call them J ews myself. I refer to them as so-called Jews, because I know wha t they are.) The eastern European Jews, who form 92 per cent of the world's population of those people who call themselves Jews , were"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":" 249 originally Khazars. They were a warlike tribe who l ived deep in the heart of Asia. And they were so warlike that ev en the Asiatics drove them out of Asia into eastern Europe. They se t up a large Khazar kingdom of 800,000 square miles. At the time , Russia did not exist, nor did many other European countries. T he Khazar kingdom was the biggest country in all Europe -- so big and so powerful that when the other monarchs wanted to go to war, the Khazars would lend them 40,000 soldiers. That's how big and powerful they were. They were phallic worshippers, ( Footnote 61 ) which is filthy and I do not want to go into the details of that now. But th at was their religion, as it was also the religion of many other pagans and barbarians elsewhere in the world. The Khazar king became so disgusted with the degeneracy of his kingdom that h e decided to adopt a so-called monotheistic faith -- either Chri stianity, Islam, or what is known today as Judaism, which is really Tal mudism. By spinning a top, and calling out \"eeny, meeny, miney , moe,\" he picked out so-called Judaism. And that became the s tate religion. He sent down to the Talmudic schools of Pumbedita a nd Sura and brought up thousands of rabbis, and opened up s ynagogues and schools, and his people became what we call Jew s. There wasn't one of them who had an ancestor who ev er put a toe in the Holy Land. Not only in Old Testament his tory, but back to the beginning of time. Not one of them! And yet they come to the Christians and ask us to support their armed in surrections in Palestine by saying, \"You want to help repatriate G od's Chosen People to their Promised Land, their ancestral home , don't you? It's your Christian duty. We gave you one of our bo ys as your Lord and Savior. You now go to church on Sunday, an d you kneel and you worship a Jew, and we're Jews.\" But t hey are pagan Khazars who were converted just the same as t he Irish were converted. It is as ridiculous to call them \"p eople of the Holy Land,\" as it would be to call the 54 million Chines e Moslems \"Arabs.\" Mohammed only died in 620 A.D., and since then 54 million Chinese have accepted Islam as their religi ous belief. Now imagine, in China, 2,000 miles away from Arabia, fr om Mecca and Mohammed's birthplace. Imagine if the 54 millio n Chinese decided to call themselves \"Arabs.\" You would say t hey were lunatics. Anyone who believes that those 54 million Chinese are Arabs must be crazy. All they did was adopt as a re ligious faith a belief that had its origin in Mecca, in Arabia. The same as the Irish. When the Irish became Christians, nobody dum ped them in the ocean and imported to the Holy Land a new crop of inhabitants. They hadn't become a different people. They were the same people, but they had accepted Christianity as a religious faith."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":" 250 These Khazars, these pagans, these Asiatics, these Turko-Finns, were a Mongoloid race who were forced out of Asia i nto eastern Europe. Because their king took the Talmudic faith, they had no choice in the matter. Just the same as in Spain: If the king was Catholic, everybody had to be a Catholic. If not, y ou had to get out of Spain. So the Khazars became what we call to day Jews. Now imagine how silly it was for the great Christia n countries of the world to say, \"We're going to use our power and prestige to repatriate God's Chosen People to their ancestral h omeland, their Promised Land.\" Could there be a bigger lie than th at? Because they control the newspapers, the magazines, the rad io, the television, the book publishing business, and becau se they have the ministers in the pulpit and the politicians on the soapboxes talking the same language, it is not too surprising that you believe that lie. You'd believe black is white if you heard it often enough. You wouldn't call black black anymore -- you'd star t to call black white. And nobody could blame you. That is one of the great lies of history. It is the foundation of all the misery that has befallen the world. (Benjamin Freedman: excerpt from a speech at the Wi llard Hotel in Washington, DC, 1961) Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion (Fraud or R eal?) In the early 20 th Century, Czar Nicholas Romanov disseminated The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion which he claimed was a seditious document used by Jews to dominate the world. Consequently, Czar Nicholas beg an persecuting and expelling Jews from Russia. Some say he merely used the Protocols as a pretext and rationale for anti-Semitism. In 1921, Philip Graves of The Times (London), explained that the Protocols bore a resemblance to a satire by the French lawyer Mauric e Joly on Napoleon III published in 1864 and entitled Dialogue aux Enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu (\"Dialogue in Hell between Machiavelli and Montesquieu\"). 16 Regardless of the document’s origin, many of the Protocols bear a striking resemblance to reality. And quite frankly, the gene ral tone of the Protocols is similar to that of the Talmud. To demonstrate my point, I w ill discuss a few example protocols from the entire suite.

Walter Lippmann—an ardent Zionist— was an influential newspaper commentators during Ke nnedy’s Presidency. In 1917, Lippmann served briefly as an assistant to Secretar y of War Newton D. Baker. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson sent Lippmann to Fra nce to take part in the negotiations for the Treaty of Versailles. Martin A gronsky—a Jew—was an influential television news correspondent for NBC w hen Kennedy was killed. Agronsky used his position to aggressively promote Lyndon Johnson as a qualified successor to the slain president (reference Chapter 1). Jewish political forces control and influence every facet of American media outlets. This includes the electronic news media, newspapers /journals, and the entertainment industry: movies, music, and book publishing indust ries. Anyone who claims that Protocol XII, Control of the Press , is untrue is simply not paying attention. The second example—Protocol V, Despotism and Modern —is used to control public opinion regarding controversial topics. The followi ng text is an excerpt from Protocol V: [9.] We shall assume to ourselves the liberal physi ognomy of all parties, of all directions, and we shall give that physiognomy a VOICE IN ORATORS WHO WILL SPEAK SO MUCH THAT THEY WILL EXHAUST THE PATIENCE OF THEIR HEARERS AND PRODUCE AN ABHORRENCE OF ORATORY.

(Excerpt from the Protocols of Zion : Protocol V, Despotism and Modern Progress ) The stated approach of \"exhausting the patience of the [listeners]\" was used extensively to cover-up the facts about the Kennedy assassination. The American public has been besieged about this crime for thirt y-seven years (as of 2002). Many people are still interested in the topic, but they simply don’t know what to think because they’ve been inundated with so much nonsens e. A close analysis of both the critics and advocates of the Warren Report reveals that Protocol V was used extensively by the conspirators. No one demonstrate s Protocol V better than Dr. Cyril Wecht who pontificated ad nauseam on The Men Who Killed Kennedy (1988) about the Single Bullet Theory (reference Chapter 7). His comments about John Connally’s"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":" 255 wounds were completely misleading. And he totally i gnored the fact that there was a four second delay between the time Kennedy grabbed his neck and the time Connally reacted to being hit—thereby missing a chance to pu blicly refute the Single Bullet Theory in the simplest terms possible. ( Footnote 63 ) Given that he is an illustrious and eminent pathologist, he cannot claim ignorance as a n excuse. Other examples of false critics are Robert Groden a nd Oliver Stone (reference Chapter 7). Both made a concerted effort to direct the public away from Jewish involvement in the Kennedy assassination. Prominent defenders of the Warren Report are Noam Chomsky, Michael Kazin, Maurice Isserman, Gerald Posner, David Belin, and Arlen Spector (reference Introduction for the l atter two names). Chomsky in particular confused the public because he is a prom inent opinion leader among intellectuals. Protocol V, is not only an effective technique for controlling public opinion on controversial topics, it is probably the most widespread propaganda tool employed today. ( Footnote 64 ) The third example—Protocol VII, Worldwide Wars —is extremely troubling because it advocates war. A serious observer of the Middle East cannot deny that Israel is one of the most war-mongering nations in history. The f ollowing text is an excerpt from Protocol VII: UNIVERSAL WAR [3.] We must be in a position to respond to every a ct of opposition by war with the neighbors of that country which dar es to oppose us: but if these neighbors should also venture to s tand collectively together against us, then we must offe r resistance by a universal war.

Over the years, many \"alternative\" historians have attempted to set the record straight, but their writings have been suppressed or their careers dest royed by Jewish political forces. In general, the new breed of historians take exception to the \"official\" explanations regarding the following historical events: \u0001 US entry into World War I \u0001 Anti-Jewish sentiment in Germany after World War I \u0001 Hitler’s conflict with Jewish political forces \u0001 The Night of Broken Glass (aka, Kristallnacht and November Pogroms ) \u0001 The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor \u0001 Details about Hitler’s persecution of Jews The first exception to conventional history—US entr y into World War I—is similar to the Gulf of Tonkin incident which led to large-scal e involvement in the Vietnam War by the United States military. When the World War I began in 1914, the conflict pitted Britain, France, and Russia on one side agai nst Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey on the other. In 1917, the United States ent ered the war but for reasons that are somewhat ambiguous. The official explanation gi ven was because a German submarine sank a French passenger ship, the SS Suss ex. Some Americans were killed because they were passengers on the French vessel, but Germany did not intentionally attack an American target. That begs the question: Why would America declare war on Germany for sinking a French ship, especially wh en Germany was already at war with France? Most modern historians agree that the reasons for America’s entrance into World War I are ambiguous, but they have littl e interest in exploring it farther. Benjamin Freedman gave a different explanation in a speech he delivered in Washington, DC in 1961. According to Freedman, the United States entered World War I for reasons far more complex than the sinking of a French vessel by a German submarine. The following text is an excerpt from Fr eedman’s speech: World War I broke out in the summer of 1914. There are few people here my age who remember that. Now that war was waged on one side by Great Britain, France, and Rus sia; and on the other side by Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Tur key. Within two years Germany had won that war: not only won it nominally, but won it actually. The German submarin es, which were a surprise to the world, had swept all the con voys from the Atlantic Ocean. Great Britain stood there without a mmunition for her soldiers, with one week's food supply -- and af ter that, starvation. At that time, the French army had mutin ied. They had lost 600,000 of the flower of French youth in the d efense of Verdun on the Somme. The Russian army was defecting , they were picking up their toys and going home, they did n't want to play war anymore, they didn't like the Czar. And th e Italian army"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":" 257 had collapsed. Not a shot had been fired on German soil. Not one e nemy soldier had crossed the border into Germany. And yet, Germa ny was offering England peace terms. They offered England a negotiated peace on what the lawyers call a status quo ante ba sis. That means: \"Let's call the war off, and let everything be as it was before the war started.\" England, in the summer of 1916 was considering that -- seriously. They had no choice. It was either accepting this negotiated peace that Germany was magnanimously offering them, or going on with the w ar and being totally defeated. While that was going on, the Zionists in Germany, w ho represented the Zionists from Eastern Europe, went to the British War Cabinet and -- I am going to be brief because i t's a long story, but I have all the documents to prove any st atement that I make -- they said: \"Look here. You can yet win this war. You don't have to give up. You don't have to accept the negotiated peace offered to you now by Germany. You can win th is war if the United States will come in as your ally.\" The U nited States was not in the war at that time. We were fresh; we were young; we were rich; we were powerful. They told England: \"We will guarantee to bring the United States into the war as your ally, to fight with you on you r side, if you will promise us Palestine after you win the war.\" In oth er words, they made this deal: \"We will get the United States into this war as your ally. The price you must pay is Palestine afte r you have won the war and defeated Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey.\" Now England had as much right to promise Palestine to anybody, as the United States would have to promise Japan to Ireland for any reason whatsoever. It's absolutely absurd that Great Britain, that nev er had any connection or any interest or any right in what is known as Palestine should offer it as coin of the realm to p ay the Zionists for bringing the United States into the war. Howeve r, they did make that promise, in October of 1916. And shortly after that -- I don't know how many here remember it - - the United States, which was almost totally pro-German, entered the wa r as Britain's ally. I say that the United States was almost totally pro -German because the newspapers here were controlled by Jews , the bankers were Jews, all the media of mass communicat ions in this country were controlled by Jews; and they, the Jews , were pro- German. They were pro-German because many of them h ad come from Germany, and also they wanted to see Germ any lick"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":" 258 the Czar. The Jews didn't like the Czar, and they d idn't want Russia to win this war. These German-Jew bankers, l ike Kuhn Loeb and the other big banking firms in the United States refused to finance France or England to the extent of one d ollar. They stood aside and they said: \"As long as France and E ngland are tied up with Russia, not one cent!\" But they poured money into Germany, they fought beside Germany against Russia, trying to lick the Czarist regime. Now those same Jews, when they saw the possibility of getting Palestine, went to England and they made this deal. At that time, everything changed, like a traffic light that chang es from red to green. Where the newspapers had been all pro-German , where they'd been telling the people of the difficulties that Germany was having fighting Great Britain commercially and in o ther respects, all of a sudden the Germans were no good. They were villains. They were Huns. They were shooting Red Cross nurses . They were cutting off babies' hands. They were no good. Shortly after that, Mr. Wilson declared war on Germany. The Zionists in London had sent cables to the Unite d States, to Justice Brandeis, saying \"Go to work on President W ilson. We're getting from England what we want. Now you go to wo rk on President Wilson and get the United States into the war.\" ( Footnote 65 ) That's how the United States got into the war. We h ad no more interest in it; we had no more right to be in it th an we have to be on the moon tonight instead of in this room. There was absolutely no reason for World War I to be our war. We were ra ilroaded into—if I can be vulgar, we were suckered into— tha t war merely so that the Zionists of the world could obtain Pale stine. That is something that the people of the United States have never been told. They never knew why we went into World War I. After we got into the war, the Zionists went to Gre at Britain and they said: \"Well, we performed our part of the agre ement. Let's have something in writing that shows that you are g oing to keep your bargain and give us Palestine after you win th e war.\" They didn't know whether the war would last another year or another ten years. So they started to work out a receipt. T he receipt took the form of a letter, which was worded in very cryp tic language so that the world at large wouldn't know what it was a ll about. And that was called the Balfour Declaration. The Balfour Declaration was merely Great Britain's promise to pay the Zionists what they had agreed upon as a con sideration for getting the United States into the war. So this great Balfour Declaration, that you hear so much about, is just a s phony as a three dollar bill. I don't think I could make it mo re emphatic than that. ..."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":" 259 (Benjamin Freedman, excerpt from a speech at the Wi llard Hotel in Washington, DC, 1961) The Balfour Declaration was a brief official commun iqué reportedly written by Sir Arthur James Balfour, ( Footnote 66 ) British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, an d sent to Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild of the English Zio nist Federation on November 2, 1917. The Balfour Declaration stated the following: His Majesty's Government views with favor the estab lishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existin g non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights and politica l status enjoyed by Jews in any other country. (Balfour Declaration, November 2, 1917) The second exception to conventional history—anti-J ewish sentiment in Germany after World War I—has never been adequately address ed by Western historians. Freedman gave the following explanation in his 1961 address: .... The United States got in the war. The United Sta tes crushed Germany. You know what happened. When the war ended , and the Germans went to Paris for the Paris Peace Confe rence in 1919 there were 117 Jews there, as a delegation rep resenting the Jews, headed by Bernard Baruch. ( Footnote 67 ) I was there: I ought to know. Now what happened? The Jews at that peace conference, when they were cutting up Germany and p arceling out Europe to all these nations who claimed a right to a certain part of European territory, said, \"How about Palest ine for us?\" And they produced, for the first time to the knowle dge of the Germans, this Balfour Declaration. So the Germans, for the first time realized, \"Oh, so that was the game! That's wh y the United States came into the war.\" The Germans for the firs t time realized that they were defeated, they suffered the terrific reparations that were slapped onto them, because the Zionists wanted Palestine and were determined to get it at any cost. That brings us to another very interesting point. W hen the Germans realized this, they naturally resented it. Up to that time, the Jews had never been better off in any country i n the world than they had been in Germany. You had Mr. Rathenau there, who was maybe 100 times as important in industry an d finance as is Bernard Baruch in this country. You had Mr. B alin, who owned the two big steamship lines, the North German Lloyd's and the Hamburg-American Lines. You had Mr. Bleichr oder, who was the banker for the Hohenzollern family. You had the"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":" 260 Warburgs in Hamburg, who were the big merchant bank ers—the biggest in the world. The Jews were doing very well in Germany. No question about that. The Germans felt: \"Well, th at was quite a sellout.\" It was a sellout that might be compared to this hyp othetical situation: Suppose the United States was at war wit h the Soviet Union. And we were winning. And we told the Soviet Union: \"Well, let's quit. We offer you peace terms. Let's forget the whole thing.\" And all of a sudden Red China came into the war as an ally of the Soviet Union. And throwing them into th e war brought about our defeat. A crushing defeat, with reparatio ns the likes of which man's imagination cannot encompass. Imagine, then, after that defeat, if we found out that it was the Chines e in this country, our Chinese citizens, who all the time we had thoug ht were loyal citizens working with us, were selling us out to th e Soviet Union and that it was through them that Red China was bro ught into the war against us. How would we feel, then, in the Uni ted States against Chinese? I don't think that one of them wou ld dare show his face on any street. There wouldn't be enough co nvenient lampposts to take care of them. Imagine how we woul d feel. Well, that's how the Germans felt towards these Jew s. They'd been so nice to them: from 1905 on, when the first Communist revolution in Russia failed, and the Jews had to sc ramble out of Russia, they all went to Germany. And Germany gave them refuge. And they were treated very nicely. And here they had sold Germany down the river for no reason at all other t han the fact that they wanted Palestine as a so-called \"Jewish commonwealth.\" Now Nahum Sokolow, and all the great leaders and gr eat names that you read about in connection with Zionism toda y, in 1919, 1920, 1921, 1922, and 1923 wrote in all their paper s—and the press was filled with their statements—that the fee ling against the Jews in Germany is due to the fact that they realiz ed that this great defeat was brought about by Jewish intercessi on in bringing the United States into the war. The Jews themselves admitted that. It wasn't that the Germans in 1919 discovered that a glass of Jewish blood tasted better than Coca-Cola or Muensc hner Beer. There was no religious feeling. There was no sentim ent against those people merely on account of their religious b elief. It was all political. It was economic. It was anything but rel igious. Nobody cared in Germany whether a Jew went home and pulled down the shades and said \"Shema’ Yisroel\" or \"Our Father .\" Nobody cared in Germany any more than they do in the Unite d States. Now this feeling that developed later in Germany wa s due to one thing: the Germans held the Jews responsible for th eir crushing defeat."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":" 261 (Benjamin Freedman, excerpt from a speech at the Wi llard Hotel in Washington, DC, 1961) There is another reason why post-World War I German s detested Jews. Popularly known as the \"stab in the back theory,\" it was beca use the German Social Democratic Party (a Jewish-led communist regime) demobilized G ermany’s military at the end of World War I. 17 A few months prior to the end of World War I, Russi an Czar Nicholas Romanov abdicated the throne at the end of the Russian Revo lution. In July 1918, the Bolsheviks executed the Czar at Yekaterinburg along with his immediate family. 18 By autumn of 1918, German/Prussian Kaiser William I I realized Germany would soon be defeated. On November 9, 1918, he fled to H olland because he feared the Bolshevik Communists would take over Germany as the y did Russia and he would meet a similar fate as Czar Nicholas and his family . In the interim, the German government was taken over by the Jewish dominated S ocial Democratic Party. Fearful of being overthrown by more radical communists led by Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht (both Jewish), the Social Democratic Par ty demobilized the German armies. 19 This put Germany in an extremely weak negotiating position with the Allied forces after the initial Armistice agreement on Nov ember 11, 1918. The original agreement did not require demobilization of German armies, only that all German armies withdraw to pre-war boundaries. 20 A fully armed Germany expected Wilson’s Fourteen Points 21 which he had formulated as the basis for a just pe ace. After the disarmament of its military, Germany got the Versai lles Treaty which was extremely harsh. Again, this is what many people call the \"st ab in the back theory.\" It appears that Germany actually got stabbed in the back twice by two different Jewish groups. Bernard Baruch et al inserted the first dag ger by getting America into World War I in exchange for the promise of Palestine by B ritain as specified in the Balfour Declaration. Later, Jewish Communists inserted the second dagger by demobilizing Germany’s military before the Armistice agreement w as finalized. As a result, Germany got the short end of the stick at Versaille s. The third exception to conventional history—Hitler’ s conflict with Jewish political forces—is quite a bit different than Western histor ians portray. Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933. On that point, every one agrees. But thereafter, things get muddy. Freedman summarized Hitler’s problems wi th Jews as follows: ... After the Communist threat in Germany was quashed , the Jews were still working, trying to get back into th eir former status, and the Germans fought them in every way they could without hurting a single hair on anyone's head. They fought them the same way that, in this country, the Prohibitionists fought anyone who was interested in liquor. They didn't fight one another with pistols. Well, that's the way they were fighting th e Jews in Germany. And at that time, mind you, there were 80 to 90 million Germans, and there were only 460,000 Jews. About on e half of one per cent of the population of Germany were Jews . And yet"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":" 262 they controlled all the press, and they controlled most of the economy because they had come in with cheap money w hen the mark was devalued and bought up practically everyth ing. The Jews tried to keep a lid on this fact. They did n't want the world to really understand that they had sold out G ermany, and that the Germans resented that. The Germans took appropriate action against the Jew s. They, shall I say, discriminated against them wherever th ey could. They shunned them. The same way that we would shun the C hinese, or the Negroes, or the Catholics, or anyone in this country who had sold us out to an enemy and brought about our d efeat. After a while, the Jews of the world called a meeti ng in Amsterdam. Jews from every country in the world att ended this meeting in July 1933. And they said to Germany: \"Yo u fire Hitler, and you put every Jew back into his former position , whether he was a Communist or no matter what he was. You can't treat us that way. And we, the Jews of the world, are servin g an ultimatum upon you.\" You can imagine what the Germa ns told them. So what did the Jews do? In 1933, when Germany refused to surrender to the w orld conference of Jews in Amsterdam, the conference bro ke up, and Mr. Samuel Untermyer, who was the head of the Ameri can delegation and the president of the whole conferenc e, came to the United States and went from the steamer to the studios of the Columbia Broadcasting System and made a radio broad cast throughout the United States in which he in effect said, \"The Jews of the world now declare a Holy War against Ge rmany. We are now engaged in a sacred conflict against the Ge rmans. And we are going to starve them into surrender. We are going to use a world-wide boycott against them. That will destro y them because they are dependent upon their export busine ss.\" And it is a fact that two thirds of Germany's food supply had to be imported, and it could only be imported with the pr oceeds of what they exported. So if Germany could not export, two thirds of Germany's population would have to starve. There wa s just not enough food for more than one third of the populati on. Now in this declaration, which I have here, and which was printed in the New York Times on August 7, 1933, Mr. Samuel Unterm yer boldly stated that \"this economic boycott is our me ans of self- defense. President Roosevelt has advocated its use in the National Recovery Administration,\" which some of yo u may remember, where everybody was to be boycotted unles s he followed the rules laid down by the New Deal, and w hich was"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":" 263 declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of t hat time. Nevertheless, the Jews of the world declared a boyc ott against Germany, and it was so effective that you couldn't find one thing in any store anywhere in the world with the words \" made in Germany\" on it. In fact, an executive of the Woolwo rth Company told me that they had to dump millions of dollars w orth of crockery and dishes into the river; that their stor es were boycotted if anyone came in and found a dish marked \"made in Germany,\" they were picketed with signs saying \"Hit ler,\" \"murderer,\" and so forth, something like these sit- ins that are taking place in the South. At a store belonging to the R. H. Macy chain, which was controlled by a family called Strauss who also happ en to be Jews, a woman found stockings there which came from Chemnitz, marked \"made in Germany.\" Well, they were cotton stockings and they may have been there 20 years, si nce I've been observing women's legs for many years and it's been a long time since I've seen any cotton stockings on them. I saw Macy's boycotted, with hundreds of people walking around w ith signs saying \"murderers,\" \"Hitlerites,\" and so forth. Now up to that time, not one hair on the head of any Jew had been hurt i n Germany. There was no suffering, there was no starvation, th ere was no murder, there was nothing. Naturally, the Germans said, \"Who are these people to declare a boycott against us and throw all our people out of work, and make our industries come to a standstill? Who are t hey to do that to us?\" They naturally resented it. Certainly they painted swastikas on stores owned by Jews. Why should a Ger man go in and give his money to a storekeeper who was part of a boycott that was going to starve Germany into surrendering to the Jews of the world, who were going to dictate who their p remier or chancellor was to be? Well, it was ridiculous. ... (Benjamin Freedman, excerpt from a speech at the Wi llard Hotel in Washington, DC, 1961) Ironically, the American Jewish Archives corroborat ed Freedman’s description of Samuel Untermyer as a Zionist Jew who organized a b oycott against German goods. The following is an excerpt from a biographical ske tch on Untermyer (1858 - 1940) found in the Archives: ...

(American Jewish Archives, March 2002 22 ) The fourth exception to conventional history— The Night of Broken Glass —is presented by Western historians as a night, on Nove mber 9-10, 1938, when the Nazis brutally attacked Jews at Hitler’s order because of their religion. The name, Night of Broken Glass , refers ironically to the litter of broken glass l eft in the streets after the night of rioting. It is also referred to as Kristallnacht , a German word meaning \"crystal night.\" The following is Freedman’s descri ption of events: .... The [international Jewish] boycott [against Germ any] continued for some time, but it wasn't until [Novem ber 7] 1938, when a young Jew [Herschel Grynszpan] from Poland w alked into the German embassy in Paris and shot a German [diplomat, Ernst vom Rath], that the Germans really started to get rough with the Jews in Germany. And you found them then b reaking windows and having street fights and so forth. .... (Benjamin Freedman, excerpt from a speech at the Wi llard Hotel in Washington, DC, 1961) Western historians have traditionally underplayed t he murder of vom Rath by Grynszpan. In fact, The Night of Broken Glass is often referred to as the November Pogroms . For example, Encyclopedia Britannica described vo m Rath’s murder as follows: \"The pretext for the pogroms was the shoot ing in Paris on November 7 of the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath by a Polish-Jewish s tudent, Herschel Grynszpan.\" 23 Historian David Irving, ( Footnote 68 ) however, found a memo sent by Hitler’s deputy, Rudolf Hess, dated November 10, 1938. The Hess memo reveals that Hitler tried to protect Jews from arson attacks during the night of rioting. The following text is an English translation of the memo: To all Gauleiter HQs for Immediate Action! Directiv e No. 174/38. Repeating Telex of November 10, 1938. On express or ders from the very highest level arson attacks on Jewish busi nesses and such are not to occur under any circumstances or co nditions whatever... 24 The Night of Broken Glass remains highly controversial amongst historians. J ewish political forces would have us believe that the Naz is terrorized innocent Jews without cause. Western historians acknowledge that a young Jew did in fact shoot and kill a German diplomat in Paris, but the incident is surpr isingly viewed as unrelated. According to Freedman, The Night of Broken Glass was not an official implementation of \"pogroms\" against Jews, but rathe r the culmination of tensions between German Gentiles toward Jews after a five-ye ar Jewish boycott—instigated by"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":" 265 Samuel Untermyer—which hurt the German economy badl y. In addition, German citizens felt betrayed by Jews over their defeat in World War I. When Herschel Grynszpan murdered German diplomat Ernst vom Rath, that was the last straw. Violent insurrections against Jews followed. Vom Ra th’s cold blooded murder by a young Jew had set off anti-Jewish furor that was di fficult to contain. Emotions came pouring out—so much so that Hitler told Hess to iss ue a directive telling Nazi officials not to commit \"arson attacks on Jewish bu sinesses....under any circumstances or conditions whatever.\" The fifth exception to conventional history—the Jap anese attack of Pearl Harbor (Dec. 7, 1941)—has been shown by historians to be a ruse perpetrated by President Roosevelt to get America into the European war agai nst Nazi Germany. Author Robert B. Stinnett ( Footnote 69 ) built a powerful case in his book, Day of Deceit , that Roosevelt had prior knowledge of the attack—which k illed 2,400 military persons and wounded 1,100 more—and allowed it to happen, even e ncouraged it. Given that Roosevelt’s top adviser, Bernard Baruch, was an ard ent Zionist, Stinnett’s explanation seems highly plausible. In 1999, the US Senate voted to exonerate Hawaii co mmanders Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and Lieutenant General Walter Short for lack of preparedness after the Pentagon declared that blame should be \"broadly sha red.\" 25 Prior to Stinnett’s work, researchers concluded that the US Government did no t crack Japanese military codes before December 7, 1941; however, Stinnett provided numerous cables of decryptions to refute that claim. He also proved that a Japanes e spy in Hawaii had transmitted information—including a map of the bombing target—b eginning on August 21, 1941, and that American intelligence knew about it. In a word, Stinnett proved how Roosevelt allowed the attack to occur. The only par t missing from his book, Day of Deceit , is Why. But Benjamin Freedman answered that quest ion long ago when he delivered his speech in Washington, DC in 1961. Not only did he explain World Wars I and II, but he essentially predicted the Six Day War, the Vietnam War, The Persian Gulf War, and the present war with Afghanistan (in 2002). The following text is an excerpt from that speech: ... What do we face now [in 1961]? If we trigger a wo rld war that may develop into a nuclear war, humanity is finishe d. Why might such a war take place? It will take place as the cu rtain goes up on Act 3: Act 1 was World War I, Act 2 was World Wa r II, Act 3 is going to be World War III. The Jews of the world, t he Zionists and their co-religionists everywhere, are determined th at they are going to again use the United States to help them p ermanently retain Palestine as their foothold for their world government.

I was \"confidential man\" to Henry Morgenthau, Sr., who was chairman of the finance committee, and I was liaison between him and Rollo Wells, the treasurer. So I sat in these meetings with President Wilson at the head of the table, and all the others, and I heard them drum into Pres ident Wilson's brain the graduated income tax and what has become the Federal Reserve, and I heard them indoctrinate him with the Zionist movement. Justice Brandeis and President Wi lson were just as close as the two fingers on this hand. Pres ident Woodrow Wilson was just as incompetent when it came to dete rmining what was going on as a newborn baby. That is how th ey got us into World War I, while we all slept. They sent our boys over there to be slaughtered. For what? So the Jews can have Palestine as their \"commonwealth.\" They've fooled y ou so much that you don't know whether you're coming or going. (Benjamin Freedman, excerpt from a speech at the Wi llard Hotel in Washington, DC, 1961) Prior to the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor, Presi dent Roosevelt was under heavy political pressure not to get the United States inv olved in military action against Germany. In 1940 and 1941, the America First Commit tee—led by Senator Gerald P. Nye—conducted Senate hearings which openly question ed the Zionist movement. Members of the Committee even accused Jewish movie moguls in Hollywood of stirring up war fever in various movie productions. Though failing in its campaigns to block the Lend-Lease Act, the use of the U.S. Navy for convoys, and the repeal of the Neutrality Act, its public pressure undoubtedly dis couraged greater direct military aid to a Great Britain besieged by Nazi Germany. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (Dec. 7, 1941), the committee dissolved and urged its members to support the war effort. 26 The sixth exception to conventional history—details about Hitler’s persecution of Jews—is probably the most important of all. Actuall y, the politically correct word to use in this discussion is Holocaust . The word was introduced in 1978 in the TV mini- series, The Holocaust , directed by Marvin Chomsky and starred Meryl Stre ep and James Woods. Before 1978, the term Holocaust was no t associated with Nazi Germany and Jews. In 1976, William Stevenson wrote a book, A Man Called Intrepid , which discussed the deaths of six million Jews duri ng World War II a great deal, but Stevenson never used the term Holocaust because tha t term had not been introduced to the public in 1976."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" 267 It is difficult to discuss Hitler and the Holocaust openly because so many opinions are based on raw emotion, not intellect. One of the mos t controversial topics discussed today among intellectuals is the total number of Je ws that died in Nazi Germany. The official number is six million. But there appears t o be a double-standard among historians as to how they tallied the number of dea d in the Holocaust versus the numbers killed in other atrocities. It is amazing to me that historians are unable to a gree on the number of German and Japanese civilians murdered by the allied forces in the fire-bombing of Dresden or the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Yet virtu ally all mainstream historians agree with great certainty that six million Jews di ed in Nazi Germany over a seven year period (1938-45) under the most clandestine ci rcumstances. Dresden, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were there one day, gone the next. Det ermining the number dead in those three cities should be relatively uncomplicat ed, but for some reason, historians cannot agree. For a complex atrocity, everyone agre es; for simpler ones, everyone argues. This double-standard should raise red flags regarding the credibility of historians on this most controversial topic. Are hi storians being pressured to lie about the Holocaust? If so, why? British historian David Irving has publicly stated his belief that the number of Jews who died in the Holocaust was intentionally inflate d for political reasons. According to Irving, if the number of Jewish dead in the Holo caust was only a million, then Hitler was no more of a war criminal than Churchill , Roosevelt, Truman, or Stalin. In order to villainize Hitler for political purposes, the number of Jewish dead had to be exaggerated significantly. That is why the number s ix million is so important. Endnotes 1.

They admired Adolf Hitler and were sympathetic to the goals of the German Nationalist Social Party. A fter reading Benjamin Freedman’s version of World Wars I and II (reference Chapter 1 3) it’s easy to understand why. And quite frankly, their opinions were probably mor e defensible than most people would care to admit. In his time, Hitler was extrem ely popular. He was Germany’s new protector after their humiliating defeat in Wor ld War I and the ensuing Treaty of Versailles. It could be argued that he was also a c olonialist and was merely doing to Britain, France and the Soviet Union what they had been doing to others for years. Consequently, it is quite understandable why a youn g John Kennedy wrote in his diary in 1945 that \"he had in him the stuff of whic h legends are made.\" But Kennedy’s praise of this hated man only makes s ense if you take exception to several historical events of the Twentieth Century (reference Chapter 13). It makes sense if you accept that US entry into World War I had more to do with the Balfour Declaration than the sinking of a French passenger ship—SS Sussex—by a German submarine. It makes sense if you accept that anti-J ewish sentiment in Germany after World War I was because the German people learned t hat Jewish moguls—Samuel Untermyer, Louis Brandeis, and Lionel Rothschild—lu red America into the war against Germany in exchange for Palestine. It makes sense if you accept that Hitler’s conflict with Jewish political forces intensified w hen Samuel Untermyer initiated a worldwide boycott of German goods which lasted five years (1933 - 1938) and badly hurt the German economy. It makes sense if you acce pt that The Night of Broken Glass was a German backlash after enduring Untermyer’s f ive-year boycott which culminated with a Jewish student shooting and killi ng a German diplomat at the German embassy in Paris. It makes sense if you acce pt that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was encouraged by President Roosevelt to get America into a second war against Germany. It makes sense if you accept t hat a great deal of hype has been added to Hitler’s persecution of Jews. If you accept these facts, then it is understandabl e why, in 1940, Kennedy wrote a book, entitled Why England Slept , which presented a fair-minded analysis of Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement of Nazi Germany. It is al so quite understandable why, in 1956, Kennedy—then a US Senator—indirectly criticiz ed the Nuremberg Trials by naming Senator Robert Taft as a courageous profile in the acclaimed book, Profiles in Courage . Kennedy cited Taft for the \"courageous act\" of cr iticizing the Nuremberg Trials while they were in progress in 1946. It is equally understandable why friends of Israel could not tolerate a Kennedy dynasty in the White House. \"Goddamn the Kennedys,\" Clyde Tolson remarked to J. Edgar Hoover. \"First there was Jack, now there’s Bo bby, and then Teddy. We’ll have them on our necks until the year 2000.\" The directo r reportedly nodded in agreement. 1 Fallout From JFK’s Assassination"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":" 270 One outcome of President Kennedy’s assassination wa s nine years of heavy US military involvement in Vietnam. The effects of the long conflict were harsh for all involved. More than 47,000 Americans were killed in action, nearly 11,000 died of other causes, and more than 303,000 were wounded in the war. Casualty figures for the Vietnamese are far less certain. Estimates of t he Army of the Republic of Vietnam’s (ARVN) casualties range from 185,000 to 2 25,000 killed and 500,000 to 570,000 wounded. The North Vietnamese and Viet Cong suffered about 900,000 troops killed and an unknown, but huge, number of w ounded. In addition, more than 1,000,000 North and South Vietnamese civilians were killed during the war. Parts of the countryside were scarred by bombs and defoliati on, and some cities and towns were heavily damaged. By the war's end much of the population of South Vietnam had become refugees seeking an escape from the figh ting. Agriculture, business, and industry had been disrupted. In the United States, Johnson's economic program for a \"Great Society\" had been largely halted by the econ omic and military demands of an unpopular war. The cost of the war has been estimat ed to have totaled about $200 billion. With the communist victory in South Vietna m and communist takeovers in neighboring Cambodia and Laos, the new Vietnam emer ged as an important Southeast Asian power. 2 A second outcome of President Kennedy’s assassinati on was a dramatic increase in heroin trafficking in the ensuing years. By 1971, i t had reached epidemic proportions. In 1965 there were only 57,000 known heroin addicts in America. By 1969 the number had grown to 315,000. And by late 1971 the e stimated total had jumped to 560,000—nearly ten times the amount in 1965. Army m edical doctors were convinced, in 1971, that 10 to 15 percent of the GI s in Vietnam were heroin users. 3 On June 17, 1971 Nixon declared that heroin addicti on was \"Public Enemy No. 1,\" ( Footnote 70 ) and he targeted Auguste Joseph Ricord for extradit ion from Paraguay and subsequent prosecution in the US for large-scale he roin smuggling. 4 A third outcome of President Kennedy’s assassinatio n was the Six Day War, a watershed event that transformed Israel from a smal l nation into a colonial empire. Although Israel became a nation in 1948, it expande d dramatically after the Six Day War. Israel took from the Arabs—through military fo rce—the Old City of Jerusalem, the Sinai and the Gaza Strip, the Jordanian territo ry west of the Jordan River known as the West Bank, and the Golan Heights, on the Isr aeli-Syrian border. 5 In addition to acquiring new land, Israel gained control of an add itional 900,000 Arabs who became the discontented subjects of the new Israeli empire . Since 1967, the number of Arabs under Israel’s military control has grown to over 1 .75 million. 6 Amnesty International has documented Israel’s inhum ane treatment of its Palestinian subjects citing arbitrary arrests, torturing detain ees, destroying or sealing the homes of Arab suspects and their relatives, confiscating lan d, destroying crops, and diverting precious water from thirsty Palestinians in the des ert to fill the swimming pools and water the lawns of Israeli settlers. 7 This conduct is condoned, embraced, and encouraged by the United States through its steadfa st financial and military support of Israel. Today, US tax payers spend approximately $3 billion annually to subsidize, support, and arm Israel. Although Israel is a wealt hy country by western standards, it receives more American foreign aid money, 28 percen t, than any other country. 8 "},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":" 271 Points of Discussion There are several points that I believe are relevan t to the assassination but need further clarification. First of all, I believe I have shown a strong Mafia presence in the assassination; however, there was not a vendetta ag ainst President Kennedy because he had \"double-crossed\" them. The Mafia’s role was purely mercenary. A new source of opium was needed for heroin production and Kenne dy’s death allowed American and French-Corsican crime syndicates to utilize Sou theast Asia for this purpose once Kennedy was replaced by Johnson who quickly escalat ed the war. I have further demonstrated that Meyer Lansky was the primary Amer ican mobster involved in the assassination, but he was also Jewish which links h im to the Jewish conspiracy. Santo Trafficante may have had prior knowledge of the ass assination, but only because he was Lansky’s top lieutenant. In addition, Jack Ruby apparently worked directly for Lansky. It is also highly significant that Lansky a nd other Jewish gangsters were the first of the American Mafia to deal in heroin back in the 1920s. The Sicilians had a code of honor that forbade narcotics trafficking an d prostitution (reference Introduction). Given Lansky’s vast experience with narcotics trafficking, it may have been his idea to use heroin as the \"glue\" to hold t he rivaling factions of the conspiracy together. But there is little doubt that the forces behind the coup were much bigger than he was. Second point: Many \"left-wing historians\" tend to l ump Alan Dulles and John Foster Dulles together as symbols of right-wing ideology. Although they were both Cold Warriors, their views about Israel were quite diffe rent. Alan was a Zionist but John Foster had little use for Israel. While running the OSS during World War II, Alan Dulles worked extensively with American Jews who la ter acquired a great deal of stature. Examples include Arthur Goldberg, future S upreme Court Justice, and William Paley, future president of CBS. On the othe r hand, John Foster Dulles fully supported President Eisenhower’s efforts to contain Israel’s expansion. In Chapter 10 I described how Eisenhower and J. F. Dulles were pa rticularly harsh with Israel when Ben-Gurion conspired with France and Britain to att ack Egypt during the Suez Crisis (1956-57). Both John Foster Dulles and President Ei senhower held views about Israel that were identical to those held by President Kenn edy and his father. If anything, Dulles and Eisenhower were more open about their di sdain for the Jewish state than were the Kennedys. Third point: President Nixon acquired vast insight about Israel during his vice- presidency with Eisenhower. As I pointed out in Cha pter 10, Eisenhower was perhaps the strongest president in the 20 th Century regarding Israel. No other president in th e last fifty years has forced Israel to behave the wa y Eisenhower did during the Suez Crisis. Nixon obviously learned a great deal from t hat episode. Fourth point: The Suez Crisis of 1956-57 and the Si x Day War of 1967 were both Israel’s efforts to seize Arab land by force. In Ch apter 10, I pointed out that the primary difference between the two assaults was the outcome. In 1956-57, Israel lost militarily and was humiliated by negative worldwide condemnation. Ten years later, they were successful. In both instances, they attac ked Egypt and tried to overthrow President Nasser. He was hated by the Israelis beca use he was a unifying force among Arab nations, plus he demonstrated time and time ag ain that he could not be bought off by the West. In 1956-57, President Eisenhower, Secretary of State John Foster"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":" 272 Dulles, and UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld w ere united in their efforts to contain Israel and force it to abide by internation al law. Had it not been for Lyndon Johnson—then Senate Majo rity Leader—the UN would have imposed economic sanctions on Israel in 1957 f or not withdrawing its forces from the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gaza Strip in the wa ke of the failed attack on Egypt. Johnson rallied support for Israel in the Senate, p lus he wrote a letter to Secretary of State Dulles on Israel’s behalf. The letter was pub lished in the New York Times on February 20, 1957. A few months later, John Kennedy —then a US Senator—gave a signal to the Eisenhower Administration and Israel that he would not bow to the whims of the Jewish State if elected president. On July 2, 1957, Kennedy delivered a speech on the floor of the Senate condemning France for it’s colonial occupation of Algeria and for waging a brutal war against that na tion. Israel did not support independence for Algeria because that meant the ris e of another Arab state. Kennedy’s support for Algerian independence was als o a message to Israel: Behave! By 1967, things had changed a great deal over the t en years leading up to the Six Day War. Israel’s most influential adversaries had eith er died or left public office. Eisenhower had retired years earlier and was in fai ling health. John Foster Dulles had died of cancer in 1959. Dag Hammarskjöld had been k illed in a mysterious plane crash in the Congolese province of Katanga in 1961. President Kennedy of course had been assassinated in Dallas in 1963. And Israel’s o ld ally, Lyndon Johnson, had become Commander-in-Chief of the United States. In July of 1965, President Johnson had appointed Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg as US ambassador to the UN. Goldberg—a Jew and ardent supporter of Israel—repla ced Adlai Stevenson as US delegate to the UN after Stevenson died suddenly of a heart attack on July 14, 1965. The Yemen War had been eroding Arab unity since the conflict began in 1962 (reference Chapter 10). By 1967, Egyptian forces ha d suffered heavy losses and were weakened after five years of military involvement i n the Yemen War. Whether these events were random or planned is anyone’s guess, bu t they were definitely advantageous to Israel by the time the Six Day War occurred in 1967. Fifth point: Lyndon Johnson’s damage control in the wake of the Suez Crisis has been erased from the history books. This more than anyth ing else points to collusion among Johnson, Israel, the American news media and book-p ublishing industry. This more than anything else indicates that Johnson was a poi nt man for Israel in the US Senate. This more than anything else makes Johnson a prime suspect as a co-conspirator in the assassination of President Kennedy. I have read numerous accounts of the Suez Crisis and have never seen anything about Johnson’s letter to Secretary of State Dulles which was printed in the New York Times on F ebruary 20, 1957. Ironically, the only place where I read anything about Johnson’ s 1957 damage control for Israel—other than in the New York Times itself—was from the pen of Louis Bloomfield in his 1957 book, Egypt, Israel and the Gulf of Aqaba , p. 152. As I pointed out before, Bloomfield was likely the man w ho masterminded the assassination of the President Kennedy (reference I ntroduction, and Chapters 3, 4, & 5). Sixth point: One of the reasons for Nixon’s diploma tic success with China in 1972 was his personal rapport with Chinese Premier Chou En-lai. It has been widely documented that Chou En-lai liked Nixon on a person al level, but few people"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":" 273 understand why. If we recall the Opium Wars of the 19 th Century (reference Chapter 11), then it becomes quite obvious why Chou En-lai liked Nixon. The Chinese leader realized the Nixon was making a serious effort to s top Western opium smuggling, something that was used as a weapon against the Chi nese until the Communists took over in 1949 and banned all narcotics. Nixon’s purs uit of August Ricord demonstrated that he was changing the Anglo-French-American expl oitation of Asia through opium and heroin smuggling. In Chapter 11, I pointed out that Chou En-lai reportedly told Nasser, in 1965, that he was going to use opium as a weapon against American soldiers in Vietnam the same way the West has used it against China. Nixon had demonstrated through his actions that he believed t he practice of smuggling narcotics was wrong. Apparently this made quite an impression on Chou En-lai. Seventh point: Many historians have incorrectly lab eled Joseph Kennedy Sr as someone who cared only about money. It is certainly true that he acquired a vast fortune, but that alone does not prove that attaini ng financial success was his primary interest. It is quite obvious that the elder Kenned y believed Zionist expansion was a threat to the United States and he did everything h e could to stop it. This would have been an unwise position to take if he only cared ab out money. Furthermore, he supported British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlai n’s appeasement of Hitler. And he continued to hold that belief after World War II . I also believe he knowingly encouraged his sons to risk their lives in this end eavor. It has been well-documented that he believed President Roosevelt had his eldest son, Joe Jr, killed in a top secret bombing mission in order to prevent him from becomi ng president. Nevertheless, he still encouraged his younger son, John, to continue the same fight. These were not the actions of a man who was driven purely by money. Eighth point: Historians should point out that Davi d Ben-Gurion, the so-called \"Father of Israel,\" renounced Zionism before he die d. In his later years, Ben-Gurion stated the following: \"I’m no longer a Zionist, I’m no longer a Socialist, I don’t belong to Histadrut , I resigned from the Knesset.\" 9 I believe Ben-Gurion was demoralized by President Kennedy’s assassination. H e resigned as prime minister on June 16, 1963, six days after Kennedy’s eloquent Am erican University speech which expressed the hope for world peace. It is my suspic ion, however, that Nahum Goldmann (president of the World Jewish Congress) i ssued the order to kill Kennedy immediately after the American University speech. I further suspect that Ben-Gurion was personally moved by Kennedy’s eloquent words an d refused to participate in the plot to kill him. That is probably the real reason for his resignation. Ben-Gurion may have had an epiphany of sorts after hearing or read ing Kennedy’s speech and was apparently overcome with shame at the thought of pl otting to kill such a wise man. Michael Collins Piper suggested in his book, Final Judgment , that Ben-Gurion resigned in order to go underground and set up Kenn edy’s assassination. In my view, Piper’s contention that Ben-Gurion was the mastermi nd is thoroughly refuted by Ben- Gurion’s later rejection of Zionism. Ninth point: Martin Luther King made a mistake by s upporting the Black-Jewish Alliance. This coalition was doomed for a couple of reasons. In the 20 th Century, the Ku Klux Klan had more of a vendetta against Jews th an blacks. White supremacy had been a big issue for the Klan immediately after the Civil War, but they disbanded in 1869 once their goals were achieved. The Klan was r evived again in the early part of the 20 th Century primarily to fight Jewish immigration from Czarist Russia. Secondly,"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":" 274 Martin Luther King was a Christian and the Talmud i s secretly anti-Christian (reference Appendix C ). Fifteen-Year Reign of Terrorist Likud Party In 1973, Menachem Begin—former terrorist—formed the ultra-right political party by merging his former terrorist organization, Irgun Zv ai Leumi, with several other political groups including the Haganah (reference C hapter 8). In 1977, Begin was elected Prime Minister of Israel and the Likud Part y ruled with an iron fist over Israel for the next fifteen years. During that period, Beg in was prime minister for six years and Shamir for seven. ( Footnote 71 ) It was during this period that Israel constantly f ought with Lebanon which culminated with the Israeli mass acres at Sabra and Shatilla. The Jonathan Pollard spy incident also occurred during that period. Bush and Clinton Attempted to Make Peace in the Mid dle East Presidents George H. W. Bush and William J. Clinton made serious attempts to establish a genuine peace between Israel and the PL O. In October 1991, the Bush Administration initiated the Madrid Conference whic h was an attempt to enforce UN Resolutions 242 and 338. ( Footnote 72 ) Bush was evidently using his high approval ratings—a direct result of the Persian Gulf War—as leverage to enforce the stated Resolutions. Although Bush was apparently sincere, the chances for an Israeli commitment to peace were slim given that Yitzhak Sh amir—harder-liner and former terrorist—was Prime Minister of Israel and head of the ultra-right Likud Party. ( Footnote 73 ) But in June 1992, the Likud Party’s fifteen-year r eign ended with the election of Yitzhak Rabin, head of the Labour Party. This was a major shift in Israeli politics. It seemed as though peace might finally prevail betwee n the PLO and Israel. The negotiations at the Madrid Conference were dela yed because of a change in leadership in America. Bush’s popularity plummeted which led to his subsequent defeat in the fall elections of 1992 by Bill Clinto n. ( Footnote 74 ) Shortly after Clinton took office in January 1993, Norway intervened as mediat or in the peace process. The end result was the Oslo Accords which were announced in the fall. On September 13, 1993 President Clinton hosted a signing ceremony at the White House for the Oslo Accords. The ceremony was attended by all intereste d parties including Yasser Arafat, until then persona non grata in the United States. 10 Per the accords, Israel recognized the PLO and agreed to gradually implement limited s elf-rule for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 11 The Accords specifically stated that UN Resolution s 242 and 338 would finally be implemented. The future se emed bright, but hopes of peace slowly evaporated as events unfolded. The driving force behind the Oslo Accords was Norwe gian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Johan Joergen Holst. The Norwegian statesm an initiated eleven secret negotiations between the PLO and Israel from April to August 1993. In fact, he hosted the first several secret meetings at his country ho me in Smestad, with others at the Borregaard estate mansion east of Oslo and the Oslo Plaza Hotel. 12 "},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":" 275 On January 13, 1994, four months after the signing of the Oslo Accords, Johan Joergen Holst died unexpectedly in Norway of a hear t attack at the age of 56. 13 On November 4, 1995, Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir, an Israeli of Yemenite origin. (Reference Appendix B for an article— A Mother’s Defense — written by the assassin’s mother, Guela Amir, and p ublished in the March 1997 edition of George Magazine , ( Footnote 75 ) p. 138.) The Death of Vince Foster Deputy White House Counsel Vincent W. Foster’s body was found in Fort Marcy Park, Fairfax County, Virginia, on July 20, 1993. H is death was perhaps one of the most damaging scandals in the administration of Pre sident Clinton. Foster died of a gunshot wound, and his death was immediately ruled suicide by the United States Park Police. There is little doubt, however, that F oster was murdered and it is quite obvious that there was a cover-up—two topics I will address shortly. But for now, let us focus on the motive. Rumors circulated that Foster was spying for Israel , that he was the victim of a Mossad hit squad, the CIA, the Mafia, and so on. No one, however, has connected his death with the Oslo Accords. I believe it is quite possible that Foster attended the secret meetings in Norway, held by the late Johan J oergen Holst, that led to the Oslo Accords. Certainly a representative from the Clinto n Administration was present. He was likely working on behalf of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton who later emerged as an advocate for a Palestinian State. I f urther believe that Foster’s death was probably a signal sent to Hillary by Likud radi cals warning her to stay out of Middle Eastern affairs. The message was clear: No P alestinian state. The following facts support this assertion. First of all, Foster’s death occurred during the ti me-frame of the secret negotiations. As previously stated, Foster died on July 20, 1993. The secret negotiations between the PLO and Israel occurred from April to August 19 93 in Norway. Secondly, Foster’s death was followed by the deaths of Johan Joergen Holst and Yitzak Rabin, both key players in the Oslo Accords. This is highly suspicious. Holst died on January 13, 1994, just six months after Fos ter. As Rabin began to implement the Oslo Accords, he was shot and killed on Novembe r 4, 1995, by Yigal Amir, an Israeli of Yemenite origin. His mother, Guela Amir, claims that he was goaded into assassinating Rabin by an agent provocateur working for Israeli Intelligence. (Reference Appendix B for Guela Amir’s article in George Magazine , March 1997, p. 138.) Thirdly, Foster and Hillary had a symbiotic relatio nship. Clinton’s former bodyguard, Arkansas State Trooper Larry Douglass Brown, stated in several interviews that he was aware of a serious and longstanding affair betw een Foster and Hillary—then partners at the famed Rose law firm—dating back to the mid-1980s. In addition to being one of Clinton’s preferred bodyguards, Brown’ s wife-to-be, Becky McCoy, was"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":" 276 Chelsea’s nanny. 14 According to Brown, Foster and Hillary were clearl y in love, but it was an affair of the mind more than anything else. Ambrose Evans-Pritchard wrote in his book, The Secret Life of Bill Clinton : \"Foster was devoted. He would do anything for her. And she took advantage of that. There was no one else in the world that she could trust more than Vince Foster.\" 15 Roger Morris described the complexities of Foster’s relation with Hillary in his book, Partners in Power : There would be several sources—including a former U S attorney, sometimes aides, a number of lawyers, social friend s, and many of the same troopers who testified about the govern or’s illicit acts—who described the First Lady’s affair, dating to the mid- 1980s, with Rose partner Vince Foster. A relationsh ip evident in the semiprivate kisses and furtive squeezes at part ies and dinners described by the security guards, it was al so an intimate professional bond between two attorneys who worked together on some of their firm’s most sensitive cases. Along with Webster Hubbell, they staged a veritable coup d’état to wre st control of the Rose firm in 1988. Many thought that the governor w as well aware of the affair and ultimately accepted it as o ne more implicit bargain in their marriage. Clinton continued to tre at Vince Foster as the close friend he had been since childhood in Hope, even entrusting him with some of the most crucial secret s of the 1992 campaign. \"Bill knew, of course he knew,\" said a la wyer close to Foster who was familiar with them all. \"But what th e hell was he supposed to say to anybody about being faithful?\" To some, Hillary’s relationship with Vince Foster, a tall, handsome, courtly figure who was widely respected i n the Little Rock legal and business community, was an understan dable and natural response to her husband’s behavior. Foster was known to treat her with dignity, respect, and abiding love s he was missing in her marriage. \"He adored her,\" said a fellow law yer. Under other circumstances, it might have been one of thos e relationships that remained private and without any political relevance to the Clinton presidency. What set it ap art was that, once in the White House, the Clintons would install the First Lady’s confidant in one of the nation’s most sensit ive positions as deputy counsel to the president, where he would han dle controversial matters stemming from their Arkansas past as well as highly classified presidential affairs. 16 Fourthly, Foster kept tabs on President Clinton for Hillary. Ambrose Evans-Prichard wrote that Foster had solicited the services of sec urity executive Jerry Parks, in 1989, to perform discreet surveillance on Clinton—then Go vernor of Arkansas. When Parks asked why he needed this done, Foster said he neede d it for Hillary. She was apparently gauging his vulnerability to charges of philandering if he decided to launch a bid for the presidency. 17 Parks was murdered on September 26, 1993—just two months after Foster’s death. A professional assassi n shot him several times in Little Rock in front of several astonished witnesses. 18 According to his widow, Jane Parks,"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":" 277 her husband had carried out sensitive assignments f or the Clinton circle for almost a decade, and the person who gave him his instruction s was Vince Foster. 19 Media Cover Story: Foster Was Depressed The role of Jewish journalists in covering up impor tant facts about Foster’s death cannot be understated. The following Jewish journal ists and authors flooded the printed media with articles supporting the cover st ory that Foster was depressed, something that is completely unsubstantiated: \u0001 Michael Isikoff – Washington Post reporter who first revealed the existence of a suicide note containing names of psychiatrists ; however, the story changed without explanation. Isikoff also wrote tha t police were turned away from the Foster house, a lie. \u0001 Walter Pincus – Washington Post CIA beat reporter. Pincus acknow ledged knowing Foster personally and was the first to writ e that he had noticed Foster out of sorts emotionally, without actually saying \" depressed.\" This gave the public the clear impression that Foster was depress ed. \u0001 Sidney Blumenthal – Wrote a New Yorker article making the case of Fo ster's depression. The New Yorker was the first national m agazine to aggressively claim that Foster suffered from depression. Blument hal was the first to write that Foster had lost 15 pounds, though he gave no s ource for that information. In reality, Foster had actually gained weight since arriving in Washington. \u0001 Frank Rich – New York Times columnist who was the first to la y out the psychological theory of excessive perfectionism as cause of suicide. 20 Other Jewish journalists propagated misleading info rmation about the Foster case. An example is Chris Ruddy, a former writer for the New York Post. Although he has never admitted it, Ruddy is almost certainly Jewish . He attended Hebrew University and has been heavily praised by Rabbi Morton Pomera ntz. \"The Jewish people have survived because we believe in truth and courage an d we respect tenacity. David is our hero, not Goliath. [Chris] Ruddy has lived up t o that ideal,\" (Rabbi Morton Pomerantz, from Journalist Who Dealt With Holocaust Survivors Takes on Vincent Foster and Mike Wallace ; The Jewish Voice and Opinion , Vol. 9, No. 4, December 1995). Ruddy pretends to be a critic of Clinton Whi te House and the official version of the Foster case, but his criticism is fumbling a nd half-hearted. A second example is Mike Wallace who interviewed Ru ddy on 60 Minutes (CBS) on October 8, 1995 about the Foster case. Wallace crea ted the impression that Ruddy’s investigation of the Foster case was shoddy. By tai nting Ruddy’s credibility, Wallace suggested that the notion of murder was out of the question. Other prominent Jews were entangled in the Foster c ase as well. They included the following:"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":" 278 \u0001 Nathan Landow – Foster spent the last weekend of his life meetin g with Webb Hubbell and Landow on latter's estate.

But two in particular stand out because of the victims’ high social status. They were George de Mohrenschildt and William Sullivan. Both were prominent men—the latter had served as deputy director at the FBI—and were s cheduled to meet with the House Select Committee on Assassinations when they were k illed. On March 29, 1977, George de Mohrenschildt was foun d dead of a gunshot blast to the head at his sister-in-law’s fashionable home in Manalapan, Florida. De Mohrenschildt had been Oswald’s handler in Dallas ( reference Chapter 6). His death was ruled suicide. 22 He died three hours after arranging to meet invest igator, Gaeton Fonzi, ( Footnote 76 ) from the House Select Committee on Assassinations. 23 Earlier that day, de Mohrenschildt had met with writer Edward Ja y Epstein. 24 Epstein is a highly suspicious individual. In 1969, he wrote Counterplot which attacked Garrison and his prosecution of Clay Shaw. Epstein wrote another propagandistic book, Legend (1978), which pushed the cover story that the Sovi et KGB sponsored the Kennedy assassination, and that O swald was working for them. In 1966, Epstein wrote Inquest , a mild critique of the Warren Report which was ha iled by the media—a telling indictment of his virtue. On November 9, 1977, William Sullivan—number two ma n at the FBI when Kennedy was shot and killed with a high-powered rifle near his home in New Hampshire. Sullivan had just completed a preliminary meeting w ith investigators for the House Select Committee on Assassinations. The man who sho t him was the son of a state policeman and claimed to have mistaken Sullivan for a deer. He was arrested, charged with a misdemeanor—\"shooting a human being by accid ent\"—and released into the custody of his father. No further investigation was ever done. 25 In addition, Sullivan was finishing an exposé on Hoover’s FBI, with journ alist Bill Brown, when he was killed. Two years later, Brown published Sullivan’s book entitled, The Bureau: My Thirty Years in Hoover’s FBI . It was a major indictment of J. Edgar Hoover and Lyndon Johnson."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":" 279 Deaths of Rock Stars The untimely deaths of rock stars have troubled me for years. The first name that comes to mind is John Lennon who was assassinated by Mark Chapman in front of his home in New York City on December 8, 1980. He w as 40. In recent years, his younger son—Sean Lennon—made the following comments about his father’s death: ( Footnote 77 ) [He] was a counterrevolutionary and was very danger ous to the government. If he had said ‘Bomb the White House to morrow,’ there would have been 10,000 people who would have done it. The pacifist revolutionaries are historically kille d by the government, and anybody who thinks Mark Chapman was just some crazy guy who killed my dad for his own person al interest is insane or very naive. It was in the best interest o f the United States to have my dad killed. And you know, that wo rked against them, because once he died, his power grew. So I me an, fuck them! They didn’t get what they wanted. 26 In addition to being a counterrevolutionary, John L ennon was certainly not a friend of Jews. Although he had many Jewish business associat es, he clearly held certain Jews in low esteem and did not hesitate to express his v iews publicly. In the latter days of the Beatles, John nearly agreed to allow John Eastm an—Paul McCartney’s Jewish brother-in-law and attorney—to manage the quartet. ( Footnote 78 ) But after meeting Eastman, Lennon withdrew his support because of Eas tman’s abrasive demeanor. Lennon sarcastically labeled Eastman’s communicatio n skills during their first meeting as an \"epileptic fit.\" 27 Lennon made the following remarks about Eastman’s ethnicity in a 1970 interview with Rolling Stone : They’re fucking bastards, they’re—Eastman’s a WASP Jew, man! And that’s the worst kind of Jew on earth, that’s t he worst kind of WASP too—he’s a WASP Jew, can you imagine it! 28 Ironically, all of Lennon’s managers were Jewish. T he Beatles original manager, Brian Epstein, was Jewish. So was Alan Klein who be came Epstein’s replacement, much to the chagrin of McCartney and his brother-in -law. Based on his comments about Eastman, it appears that Lennon viewed all Je ws with a degree of contempt, but apparently wanted one to handle his business affair s because—as I pointed out in the Introduction—the entertainment industry in America is run almost exclusively by Jews. Lennon apparently understood this. In addition to Lennon, three prominent rock stars—w ho were headline acts at the celebrated Woodstock rock festival—died about a yea r after the legendary event. They were Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Al Wilson . The latter is less known than Hendrix or Joplin, but Wilson was one of the foundi ng members of Canned Heat , one"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":" 280 of the hottest blues bands of the era. All three di ed from heroin-related causes. ( Footnote 79 ) The Woodstock Festival—August 15–17, 1969—brought a bout the harmonious gathering of about 400,000 young rock-music devotee s and marked what is considered the high point of the American youth cou nterculture of the 1960s. It was also viewed my many as a powerful political stateme nt against US involvement in the Vietnam War at a time when American forces were at an all-time high: 540,000 soldiers. Jimi Hendrix played a dramatic virtuoso r endition of The Star Spangled Banner on a screeching electric guitar that simulated the sounds of bombs dropping, explosions blasting, and machine guns firing, combi ned with the melody line of America’s national anthem presented as an avante-ga rde work of musical art before the huge gathering of spellbound American youths. Al Wilson, guitarist for Canned Heat, was the first to meet his premature demise. He died on September 3, 1970 at the age of 27. A shrou d of mystery surrounds his death. Some suggest it was a heroin overdose, others say s uicide. His band, Canned Heat , was reportedly the third highest paid act at Woodst ock. In addition, they were one of the few bands at the concert who could draw huge cr owds in their own right. 29 Jimi Hendrix was the second casualty. On September 18, 1970, just two weeks after Wilson’s death, Hendrix was found dead in London, E ngland from a drug overdose. He was also 27. Janis Joplin was next. On October 4, 1970, two week s after Hendrix’s death, Joplin was also found dead from a drug overdose in Los Ang eles, California. She too was 27. Like Hendrix, she was an incredibly charismatic, hi gh-energy performer. Within a year, two other legendary rock stars died: Jim Morrison (July 3, 1971, heart attack, ( Footnote 80 ) age 27), Duane Allman ( Footnote 81 ) (October 29, 1971 motorcycle accident, age 24). A week before Woodstock began, the \"Charles Manson Family\" committed the ritualistic murders of actress Sharon Tate and seve ral friends at her home in California on August 9, 1969. The bizarre hippie Family also m urdered Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary around the same time. Manson had the look of a charismatic rock star ( Footnote 82 ) —shoulder-length hair, beard and mustache, and a su llen stare—and his followers were mostly young \"hippie\" women in their late teens or early twenties. By appearances, they would have fit in perfectly with the young female groupies at Woodstock. Manson—who was in his mid-thirties in 1969—used LSD as a form of mind-control over his followers, although he rarely used it hims elf. This technique has been well- documented as a procedure used by the CIA in variou s mind-control experiments. In addition, state prosecutors built a case against Ma nson claiming that he was inspired by the lyrics from the Beatles White Album . Vincent Bugliosi, the LA District Attorney who prosecuted Manson, wrote a book, Helter Skelter , named after one of the Beatle songs that allegedly caused the Manson F amily to commit mass-murder."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":" 281 On December 6, 1969, just four months after Woodsto ck, the Rolling Stones gave a nightmarish concert at the Altamont Motor Speedway outside of San Francisco. The Stones were the headliners and someone convinced th em that using Hell's Angels as security would be useful. While performing Sympathy for the Devil several of the Angels murdered a concert-goer—all in view of the p erformers. Three other people were murdered by the Angels. Other bands at the con cert included the Grateful Dead, the Jefferson Airplane, ( Footnote 83 ) and Ike and Tina Turner. In 1970, Albert and David Maysles released a film documentary of the tragic e vent entitled Gimme Shelter . The impact of these events on rock music was devast ating. The Manson Family’s ritualistic murders tainted the carefree image of f lower children. In addition, District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi attempted to tarnish the music of the Beatles by building his entire case against Manson on Helter Skelter , a Beatle song from their White Album. The violent murders of four people at the Ro lling Stones concert at Altamont created the illusion that only thugs attended rock concerts. The deaths of five major rock stars—mostly from drug overdoses—within 14 mon ths of Woodstock dramatically slowed the momentum of the rock music phenomenon as a vehicle for artistic and political expression. It also fed the stereotype that all rock musicians were drug addicts. These events had a chilling effect th at seriously weakened the youth counterculture movement which expressed itself thro ugh rock music. It has never recovered. As previously stated, the Woodstock rock festival w as not merely a large musical gathering. It was also 400,000 young Americans thum bing their noses at Uncle Sam and his war in Vietnam. Woodstock occurred just sev en months after Lyndon Johnson abdicated his leadership, thereby leaving 540,000 A merican soldiers—mostly draftees—in Southeast Asia. Anyone who thinks that Uncle Sam was not intimidated by the solidarity demonstrated by America’s youth a t Woodstock—well, to quote Sean Lennon, they’re either \"insane or very naïve.\" Ironically, America’s youth tended to associate Pre sident Nixon with the problems in Vietnam. But as I pointed out in Chapter 12, his vi ew of the war was apparently little different from theirs. Waco After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the mission of US intelligence agencies shifted from fighting the spr ead of communism to fighting terrorism. Ironically the war on terrorism began a few years after the FBI’s brutal attack on the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas, on A pril 19, 1993, in which approximately eighty civilians were killed. Indepen dent investigator Carol Valentine has brought to public attention several aspects about the incident that are deeply disturbing—human carnage notwithstanding. First of all, the Amerian public does not realize t hat Davidian leader David Koresh taught that Israel was not necessary to fulfil the prophecies. Koresh’s religious teachings were an amalgam of Islam and Christianity . In fact, Koresh was the family name of Muhammad, the founder of Islam. As Koresh’s popularity grew, he became a"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":" 282 target of the US government because of his religiou s teachings. As I pointed out before, America has been under siege by Zionist for ces throughout most of the Twentieth Century. For all intents and purposes the US government was overthrown with the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963 who was replaced by mega- Zionist Lyndon Johnson. Consequently, people like K oresh became enemies of the state. His teachings of Islam and Christianity as a unified religion—one that had no use for Israel—was viewed as a threat by influentia l elements within the US government. To contain the situation, the Branch Da vidians’ compound—Mount Carmel, near Waco, Texas—was placed under aerial su rveillance several years prior to the 1993 assault by the BATF. 30 Secondly, the American public was led to believe th at the BATF botched the initial raid, on February 28, 1993, which led to the FBI as sault on April 19, 1993. The facts, however, indicate that Koresh and his followers had been targeted long before. In addition, the government’s initial explanation of t he two assaults did not make sense. The American public was told repeatedly by spokespe ople for the BATF that the February 28th raid was launched because the governm ent feared the Davidian \"cult\" was on the verge of committing mass suicide similar to the mass suicide of \"cult group leader\" Jim Jones and his followers years ear lier in Jonestown, Guyana on November 18, 1978. Nearly a thousand people died at Jonestown. After the FBI’s April 19th assault on Mount Carmel, Attorney Genera l Janet Reno told a completely different story, claiming she had no idea the David ians were suicidal. This shift in rationale clearly did not pass the smell test. 31 Thirdly, the government’s position was that the Bra nch Davidians committed mass suicide. Later, the crime was blamed on a few David ians who set Mount Carmel on fire, thereby murdering their friends—men, women, a nd children—for no apparent reason. There is, however, strong evidence that Kor esh’s successor, Clive Doyle, may have been a government provocateur who set the fire . Senator John Danforth issued a report on the Waco incident which revealed that Doy le told Texas Rangers that the Davidians had started the fire. The report also sta ted that Doyle’s jacket contained flammable liquids on both sleeves, and his hands we re burned in a manner consistent with a flashback from a liquid fire. Clive Doyle ha s never been charged with murder. And lastly, Waco was a military operation, not a po lice action. And it was headed by General Wayne Downing, the same general who now hea ds the war on terrorism in the Middle East. General Downing is a former comman der of the Special Operations Command, which was made a separate command within t he US military prior to the 1993 assaults on Mount Carmel by the BATF and FBI.. 32 The Oklahoma City Bombing On April 19, 1995, the world was stunned by the \"te rrorist\" bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 1 68 people. Timothy McVeigh was tried, found guilty, and subsequently executed for the crime. Ironically the late prime minister of Israel, Menachem Begin, did essen tially the same thing when his terrorist group, Irgun Zvai Leumi, blew up the King David Hotel in Jerusalem on July 22, 1946, killing 91 soldiers and civilians. It is interesting that in one country, the so-"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":" 283 called terrorist was sentenced to death, while in a nother country, the person responsible became prime minister. Seismograms Offered Insight Into Oklahoma City Bomb ing Two seismographs near the Murrah building ( Footnote 85 ) each recorded two low- frequency wave trains indicating the possibility of two separate explosions. The Oklahoma Geological Survey noted in an April 26, 19 95 press release that \"the location and source of the second surface wave reco rding was unknown. Detailed investigation at the building site may offer an exp lanation of the cause and origin of the second event.\" This advice was never heeded. In fact, the opposite was done. On May 23, 1995, the Murrah Building was demolished with explosives, the reby destroying any traces of evidence pointing to a second bomb. On October 8, 1 996, the American Geophysical Union published an article about the seismograms in their scientific journal, Eos . The article, entitled Seismograms Offer Insight Into Oklahoma City Bombin g , refuted the possibility of a second explosion. It was the equiv alent of the Warren Report. One report claimed that a lone gunman killed a presiden t, even though persuasive evidence indicated the opposite. The other report claimed th at a lone bomber killed 168 people, even though two seismograms indicated otherwise. Eq ually interesting, the group of scientists who wrote the Eos article had names that appeared to be quite Jewish. The main author was Thomas L. Holzer, assisted by Trond Ryberg, Gary S. Fuis, Christopher M. Dietel, Thomas M. Brocher, and Joe B . Fletcher. They reached the following conclusion in their article: \"We conclude that the two wave trains recorded during the bombing are consistent with a single imp ulsive source.\" That conclusion is suspiciously similar to the Warren Commission’s con clusion that Oswald alone killed President Kennedy. Even more troubling, Jewish Senator Arlen Specter c haired the Senate Intelligence Committee when the Murrah Building was bombed. This takes us full circle back to the Kennedy assassination when, as a young lawyer s erving as legal counsel to the Warren Commission, the same Arlen Specter wrote the \"Single Bullet Theory.\" The essence of the Single Bullet Theory is that one bul let hit President Kennedy in the neck and caused five wounds to John Connally, somet hing that is absolutely untrue. As I stated earlier, the Zapruder film clearly show s a four second delay from the time Kennedy grabbed his neck until Connally reacted to being shot. Arlen Specter’s Single Bullet Theory was the primary lie that suppo rted the Warren Commission’s conclusion that Oswald acted alone. Years later, th is known conspirator in President Kennedy’s assassination, Arlen Specter, headed Sena torial oversight of the intelligence community when the Oklahoma City bombi ng occurred. September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack on America Independent investigator Carol Valentine ( Footnote 86 ) has written several persuasive articles concluding that the suicide plane crashes on Septe mber 11, 2001 were"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":" 284 sponsored by Israel with assistance from the US mil itary. Her premise—as I interpret it—is based on two key points. First of all, the ai rspace over New York City and Washington, DC was intentionally left unprotected b y the military agency tasked to protect it. That group is the North American Aerosp ace Defense Command (NORAD). Secondly, the suicide jets were controlled by \"adva nced robotics and remote-control technology, not hijackers.\" NORAD has had this capa bility since 1959. Valentine wrote in great detail how NORAD has the c apability to track planes in distress and take appropriate actions to defend US airspace from foreign aircraft or from aircraft within the US. ( Footnote 87 ) In fact, NORAD had at its disposal a number of US Air Force General Dynamics F-106 Delta Dart figh ter aircraft configured to be remotely flown into combat as early as 1959 under t he auspices of a program known as SAGE. Another example of remote control technology is a j et, made by Northrop Grumman, called the Global Hawk . This jet has a wingspan of a Boeing 737 and has f lown unmanned across the Pacific Ocean. 33 Valentine further observed that President Bush and Robert Ayling—a former official with British Ai rways—both claimed that such a technology was a thing of the future. The two men m ade carefully prepared public statements which envisioned remote-control capabili ties as a lofty goal to be achieved in years to come. In fact, President Bush was quote d in the New York Times offering to give grants to airlines to pay for \"new technolo gy, probably far in the future, allowing air traffic controllers to land distressed planes by remote control.\" 34 Both men were obviously deceiving the public. Valentine compared NORAD’s lack of reaction on Sept ember 11 th to its rapid response to the LearJet carrying golfer Payne Stewa rt and several companions on October 25, 1999. With Stewart’s ill-fated flight—w hich was en route from Orlando to Dallas, NORAD’s reaction was fast. One or more U S Air Force fighter jets were launched to control the situation shortly after air traffic controllers knew something was wrong. On September 11 th , NORAD apparently did nothing because no jets were launched—at least no evidence has been presented in dicating that NORAD jets were launched. Based on prior emergencies, there was mor e than enough time for NORAD to send jets to control the situation. But how could Israel coerce the US military into co mmitting such an act of treason? One word: OPIUM! History repeats itself. This is wh at was done when President Kennedy was assassinated. In exchange for helping t he Jews kill Kennedy, the military and organized crime were given a war in So utheast Asia in an area where growing opium poppies was big business. Afghanistan and Pakistan are two major producers of opium today. A pact was apparently mad e between Israeli planners, US generals, and elements of organized crime stipulati ng that America would wage a war against Afghanistan in retaliation for the self-inf licted September 11 th attacks. Osama bin Laden would be blamed, his Al-Queda group would be labeled terrorists, and America would wage war against Afghanistan for harb oring these terrorists. ( Footnote 88 ) US forces would drive out the Taliban, who successf ully banned the growing of opium poppies in Afghanistan, 35 and replace them with the Northern Alliance who would legalize opium production. 36 Windfall profits would be shared by the participants from the illicit sale of opium and its derivative narcotics (namely heroin). The wealthy interests of the Western nations would also share in the illicit drug"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":" 285 money as they have done for over a century. It’s th e same technique used in the Kennedy assassination. Everyone would benefit except the American people a nd the victims and their families. Israel would use the \"terrorist\" attacks as a pretext to intensify the war against Palestinians. Clearly a cover story was wri tten and distributed to the Western news media prior to the attack. ( Footnote 89 ) To achieve such a vast conspiracy, the plan must have been announced by the president of the Wo rld Jewish Congress. That individual is presently Edgar Bronfman, son of the late Sam Bronfman (reference Chapter 8). The junior Bronfman followed the path o f Joseph Caiaphas, high priest of the Sanhedrin who sanctioned the plot to kill Jesus . Bronfman also followed the path of Nahum Goldmann, who apparently sanctioned the pl ot to kill President Kennedy. Osama bin Laden was made the patsy like Lee Harvey Oswald was years earlier in the Kennedy assassination. The US government provided a video of bin Laden taking credit for the attacks in a secret meetings. While that may seem authentic, we should remember that the US government produced phony pict ures of Oswald holding the alleged murder weapon (Mannlicher-Carcano rifle) in the backyard of his Dallas apartment in 1963 (Chapter 6). We also know that th e CIA provided the Warren Commission with a fake photograph of Oswald at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. The photograph supported the false claim that Oswal d had applied for a visa to Cuba. The Warren Commission used the alleged trip to Mexi co City as further proof that Oswald was a communist (Chapter 6). This is the sam e old story, but most of the actors changed. If I Were a Jew Over the past three years I have studied Judaism as a political force and Jewish law as described in the Talmud (Chapter 13). Based on my r esearch, I have developed a degree of mistrust and apprehension toward people o f that ethnicity. But recently I asked myself, what would I be like if I had been bo rn a Jew? Would I feel superior to Gentiles because of my Jewishness? Upon reflection, I thought of the words of President Kennedy when he spoke at American Univers ity on June 10, 1963: So, let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved. And if we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help make the world sa fe for diversity. For, in the final analysis, our most bas ic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breat he the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are al l mortal. President Kennedy was right. We should be hopeful, but not naïve. We should never be blind to the differences among peoples and their diverse cultures. There are so many differences between Jews and Gentiles (Chapter 13). But we should always remember that we are all mortal. Gentiles and Jews should interact on a personal level. Both should enlighten the other about their culture s. It is fair for Jews to enlighten"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":" 286 Gentiles on the negative historical and religious p oints of their respective non-Jewish religions. But equally, Gentiles should have the ri ght to criticize Judaism and to encourage Jews to challenge Jewish authority as Chr ist did so many years ago when he blasted the Jewish Pharisees for their evil prac tices. Here are a few examples of Jesus’s words from the book of Matthew, Chapter 23 (revised standard version): 27 - Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beau tiful, but within they are full of dead men’s bones and all un cleanness. 28 - So you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. 31 - ... You are the sons of those who murdered the p rophets. 33 - You serpents, you brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell? I don’t believe Christ meant that all Jews will bur n in Hell. He was speaking specifically of those who implemented Jewish law as practiced by the Pharisees. As a Jew, Christ was quite familiar with Jewish law and believed it was evil. The Pharisees believed in oral interpretation of the teachings of Moses. More specifically, they believed they were a master race and consequently i nterpreted the Ten Commandments in a way that made them apply to Genti les only, but not to Jews. It could be argued that this is the essence of Jewish law. According the Pharisees, it was acceptable for Jews to lie, cheat, steal, even murd er, so long as the victims were Gentiles. The practices of the Pharisees in Jesus’s time were the beginnings of what later became written Jewish law known as the Talmud . One of the most unethical practices in the Talmud i s called the Kol Nidre which frees Jews from fulfilling their vows throughout the year because apparently taking vows is a sin for Jews. The text below is directly from the Talmud. It provides insight as to why Christ was so angry with the Jewish Pharisees. Read on and become enlightened. \"And he who desires that none of his vows made duri ng the year shall be valid, let him stand at the beginning of t he year and declare, 'Every vow which I may make in the future shall be null.' HIS VOWS ARE THEN INVALID, PROVIDING THAT HE REMEMBERS THIS AT THE TIME OF THE VOW.\" (Caps in original.) (Nedarim, 23a) The American Heritage dictionary defines Kol Nidre as \"The opening prayer recited on the eve of Yom Kippur. ...\" It means \"all the vows .\" The Kol Nidre is sung to an ancient melody. This song is sung by Jews in synago gues across the world on the eve of Yom Kippur, a major Jewish holiday. In other wor ds, all practicing Jews know of the Kol Nidre."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":" 287 For more information on this topic, I invite all in quisitive people to do a search on Kol Nidre on google.com (a search engine used by ma ny journalists). I looked up Kol Nidre in the Encyclopedia Britannic a and it provided some extremely interesting information: ....According to some historians, forced Jewish conve rts to Christianity in 7th-century Spain recited the Kol N idre to annul oaths forcibly extracted from them by their persecu tors. All that is known with certainty, however, is that the prayer w as used as early as the 8th century. Rabid anti-Semites in the European Middle Ages, brushing aside the repeated Jewish ass ertion that the absolution referred only to matters between God and man, used the prayer as a pretext to question the trustw orthiness of all oaths taken by Jews in Christian courts. Fears of misunderstanding led to the elimination of the Kol Nidre from the Reform Jewish liturgy in the 19th century, but revi sed form was reintroduced in 1945. One has to ask, Why was the Kol Nidre reintroduced into Reform Jewish liturgy in 1945 after being eliminated in the previous century ? 1945 marked the end of World War II and the end of the Holocaust. Could it be th at Jewish historians have written a pack of lies about the Holocaust, a pack of lies sa nctified and encouraged by Jewish law, specifically the Kol Nidre? Could it be that H itler’s war crimes against Jews were greatly exaggerated by Zionist Jews in an effo rt to get Jews to migrate to Israel, which was established in 1948 (just three years aft er the Kol Nidre was reintroduced)? Could it be that six million Jews did not die in th e Holocaust and that gas chambers were not used? Could it be that between 500,000 and a million Jews died from disease and starvation in Nazi prison camps, not by Nazi ex termination in gas chambers? Most of what we have been taught about the Holocaus t appears to be directly linked to Jewish law and the practice of evil, not by Hitl er alone, but by organized Jewry itself. But just because Jewish law is evil, does t hat mean that all Jews are evil? In my opinion, No. But I also believe that any devout Jew should not be trusted because Jewish law teaches devout Jews that they are superi or to Gentiles, that Jews are a master race. In fact, everything that Jewish histor ians have told us about Hitler and the Nazis is also a description of devout Jews who prac tice Jewish law. Completely intolerant, superior, a master race. But still, is it reasonable to assume that someone is automatically evil just because he/she was born int o an ethnic group that encourages the practice of evil? I don’t think so. Some argue that basic religious teachings are the b uilding blocks of an individual’s value system of an individual’s personal sense of e thics. I agree that religion plays a role, but not necessarily a complete role. The Unit ed States is a secular society and its people are influenced by many things above and beyo nd religion. One of the most positive secular influences in the U.S. is its Cons titution. If someone was born a Jew, had minimal training in Jewish law, but had a stron g and sincere belief in the principles of the U.S. Constitution, then that pers on would probably be a decent human being, in my opinion. And lots of Jews admire Martin Luther King, Jr.,"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":" 288 President Kennedy, his brother Bobby, John Lennon, Mohandas Gandhi. The list goes on. These are all positive role models admired by p eople of all faiths and ethnic backgrounds. Such powerful role models force us all to develop our own sense of ethics that transcend our collective religious heri tage. After all, we cannot choose our parents, our race, our ethnic heritage or the religion we were born into. These things are all forced upon us. But God gave us minds to recognize the difference between good and evil. YES , Jewish law is evil. Christ recognized it, and was likely crucified for stating it so plainly and so openly. It is up to us—Jews and Gentiles—to use our minds t o overcome the backward teachings of any ethnic groups or religions. If I were a Jew, what would I be like? I think I wo uld be the same. I would search for the truth. I would be proud of the positive aspects of my heritage, and truthful about the negative ones. Like Jesus, I would probably cri ticize Jewish law, and would likely become the enemy of many powerful forces. Like Yitz hak Rabin, I would be willing to give my life for the cause of peace between Arab s and Jews. If I were a Jew, I would call upon the US Governmen t to crack down on those who practice Talmudic law (Chapter 13), recognizing tha t it is no different from Nazi law or Ku Klux Klan law. Talmudic law encourages hatred against non-Jews, racial superiority and ethnic purity. If I were a Jew, I w ould call upon the U.S. Justice Department to break up the Jewish monopoly of the e lectronic news media, the printed news media, the Hollywood movie industry, t he musical recording industry and CD distributors, the major book publishers and distributors, and the banking industry. I would recognize that those Jewish force s who control those interests are malevolent forces. I would recognize that these Jew ish forces are well versed in Talmudic law. I would recognize that those Jewish f orces believe it is acceptable to lie to Gentiles, cheat Gentiles, steal from Gentile s and even murder Gentiles. I would recognize that those forces are like \"serpents,\" an d \"brood of vipers,\" unable \"to escape being sentenced to hell!\" If I were a Jew, I would believe in the US Constitu tion and in the separation of church of state. As a result, I would not support the Jewi sh State of Israel, for it does not adhere to that principle. And I would petition the United States government to declare Israel an enemy nation rather than subsidizing it. I would further encourage the United States government to arrest anyone who openly suppo rts an enemy nation and try that person for treason. This would include journalists, bankers, politicians, lobbyists, media moguls, and Hollywood movie producers. The Fi rst Amendment could no longer be used as a shield for those who do the bid ding of Israel. And speaking of shields, if I were a Jew, I would not use the Holoc aust—fact or fiction—as a shield against public criticism toward powerful Jewish int erests or the Jewish State of Israel. If I were a Jew, I would visit ghettos of the inner cities and assist poor black youths break the cycle of poverty, ignorance, drugs and cr ime. I would also visit American Indian tribes for the same reason. But I would not stop there. If I were a Jew, I would visit the Japanese cities of Hiroshima, Nagasaki, a nd the German city of Dresden.

One reason I am interested in the assas sination of President Kennedy is because I truly believe his was a message of hope f or mankind. Killing him only silenced the messenger, not the message itself. Alt hough there is much evil in the world, I also believe there are many positive aspec ts to the modern age in which we live. Unlike any other period of history, mankind today i s unable to wage total war because of the advent of atomic and nuclear weapons. The on ly alternative is peace. In a sense, God has given us a great gift. In the nuclear age, He has given us two choices: total peace or total annihilation. Although Israel and ot her Zionist forces possess unconscionable international power and influence th rough their control of information flow and monetary systems, I do not believe such a tyranny will last forever. September 11, 2001 only reinforces my belief that t hey are quickly losing power. It was an act of desperation. Unlike any other period of history, mankind today c an communicate instantaneously across the globe via the Internet. Unlike any other period of history, mankind today can travel to all corners of the globe in a matter of hours. Unlike any other period of history, mankind today is merging the economies of the world. President Kennedy was equally hopeful for the futur e. The following text is the last three paragraphs from a speech he intended to deliv er on November 22, 1963 at a luncheon at the Dallas Trade Mart. Unfortunately, h e never got the opportunity to make that speech. His eloquent words become even mo re poignant when you recall that Joseph Milteer told an informant, prior to the assassination, that he believed Kennedy knew he was a marked man (Chapter 7): ... My dear friends and fellow citizens, I cite these facts and figures to make it clear that America today is stro nger than ever before. Our adversaries have not abandoned their am bitions. Our dangers have not diminished. Our vigilance cannot b e relaxed. But now we have the military, the scientific, and t he economic strength to do whatever must be done for the preser vation and"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":" 290 promotion of freedom. That strength will never be used in pursuit of aggr essive ambitions. It will always be used in pursuit of pea ce. It will never be used to promote provocations. It will always be used to promote the peaceful settlement of disputes. We in this country, in this generation are by destiny rather than choic e, the watchmen on the walls of world freedom. We ask ther efore that we may be worthy of our power and responsibility, t hat we may exercise our strength with wisdom and restraint, an d that we may achieve in our time, and for all time, the ancient vision of \"Peace on earth, good will toward men.\" That must always be our goal, and the righteousness of our cause must always underlie our strength. For as was written long ago, \"Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman w aketh but in vain.\" [Psalms 127:1] 37 Perhaps the world might fulfill the prophesy of Pre sident Kennedy’s final speech. At his funeral, Jacqueline Kennedy reportedly gave a b rief but insightful message to Soviet Diplomat Anastas Mikoyan who was sent by Pre mier Nikita Khrushchev. Mikoyan later recalled that Mrs. Kennedy said the f ollowing words as she greeted him at the reception line: \"My husband is dead. Now pea ce is up to you.\" 38 Indeed, peace is up to all of us.

You have our friendship and best wishes in your new tas ks. It is on one of these that I am writing you at this time. You are aware, I am sure, of the exchange which I h ad with Prime Minister Ben-Gurion concerning American visit s to Israel’s nuclear facility at Dimona. Most recently, the Prim e Minister wrote to me on May 27. His words reflected a most intense personal consideration of a problem that I know is not easy for your Government, as it is not for mine. We welcomed the former Prime Minister’s strong reaffirmation that Dimona will be devoted exclusively to peaceful purposes and the reaffirmat ion also of Israel’s willingness to permit periodic visits to D imona. I regret having to add to your burdens so soon afte r your assumption of office, but I feel the crucial import ance of this problem necessitates my taking up with you at this early date certain further considerations, arising out of Mr. Ben-Gurion’s May 27 letter, as to the nature and scheduling of s uch visits. I am sure you will agree that these visits should b e as nearly as possible in accord with international standards, th ereby resolving all doubts as to the peaceful intent of the Dimona project. As I wrote Mr. Ben-Gurion, this Government’s commitment to and support of Israel could be seriously jeopardized if it should be thought that we were unable to obtain reliable info rmation on a subject as vital to the peace as the question of Is rael’s effort in the nuclear field. Therefore, I asked our scientists to review the alt ernative schedules of visits we and you had proposed. If Isr ael’s purposes are to be clear beyond reasonable doubt, I believe that the schedule which would best serve our common purposes would be a visit early this summer, another visit in June 1964, and thereafter at intervals of six months. I am sure th at such a schedule should not cause you any more difficulty t han that which Mr. Ben-Gurion proposed in his May 27 letter. It would be essential, and I understand that Mr. Ben-Gurion’s l etter was in accord with this, that our scientist have access to all areas of the Dimona site and to any related part of the complex, such as fuel"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":" 294 fabrication facilities or plutonium separation plan t, and that sufficient time to be allotted for a thorough exami nation.

The article was written by Guela Amir, mother of Yigal Amir, the man who assassinated Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995. In the article, Ms. Amir made it quite clear that her son did not act a lone. She provided compelling evidence that Rabin’s assassination was sponsored b y the Israeli government, and that her son had been goaded into shooting the prime min ister by an agent provocateur working for Shin Bet, Israel’s equivalent of the FB I and Secret Service combined into one agency. The motive for the killing was because Rabin was going to give land back to the Palestinians as specified in the Oslo A ccords. The following is Ms. Amir’s article in its entirety: A Mother’s Defense , by Guela Amir (Published in George Magazine , March 1997 edition, p. 138) Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin looked exhilar ated as he made his way down the podium stairs that chilly autumn night. The pro-pea ce rally that Rabin had just addressed was an unqualified success. Some 100,000 supporters attended, and public attention was briefly deflected from the mounting c riticism of his administration. Rabin's carefree, buoyant demeanor that night seeme d to put his bodyguards at ease, and the half dozen or so agents who accompanied him to his limousine in the parking lot behind the stage encircled him only loosely. No ne of the Shin Bet (General Security Service) agents in the entourage seemed to notice the slight young man leaning casually against one of the government cars . As Rabin walked past, the young man drew a pistol, slipped into the crowd of towering security agents, and fired three rounds at the prime minister. Two of them hit Rabin's exposed back, and one shot wounded his body guard. As the shots rang out, someone at the scene shouted, \"Blanks! Blanks!\" as if to reassure the others that the bullets were not real. But the shots were not blank s. Rabin, mortally wounded, was rushed to nearby Ichilov Hospital. Curiously, as Le ah Rabin was whisked away by car to Shin Bet headquarters, one of the agents assured the prime minister's wife that the gunman had actually used \"a toy gun\" and that her h usband was fine. The reality was that Rabin lay dying in an emergency room. The gunman was my son Yigal. The shooting seemed to be an open-and-shut case of assassination. An amateur videotape of the event cl early showed Yigal walking up to"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":" 296 the prime minister and shooting him. So how could a nyone at the scene have thought that Yigal was shooting blanks? Why was another gua rd so certain that the gun wasn't real? And how is it that minutes after the shooting , even before the details of the incident were broadcast, Israeli TV received a phon e call from a man who claimed to represent a right-wing Jewish organization. He conf idently declared, \"This time we missed. Next time we won't.\" Other journalists simu ltaneously received messages on their pagers with the same statement. Throughout the tense and painful period since the a ssassination, the answers to these troubling questions have begun to emerge, and they depict what I believe is an unsavory intrigue at the highest levels of governme nt. This is the story of my search for the truth about the Rabin assassination. I was visiting a friend's home when the first news bulletin about the assassination was broadcast. The report said that a law student \"of Y emenite origin\" from Bar-Ilan University had shot the prime minister during a pea ce rally in Tel Aviv. I had heard about the rally but had no reason to think that my son Yigal would be there. Nervously, I ran to my car and drove the short dist ance home to Herzliyya, a northern suburb of Tel Aviv, my hands shaking with fear all the way. When I pulled up in front of our house I could hear my husband, Shlomo, shout ing. He is a religious scribe with a particularly gentle personality. In our more than 30 years of marriage, I have almost never heard him raise his voice. If he was shouting , something was terribly wrong. My husband grabbed my hand and we stood together, e yes fixed stonily on the television. Within minutes, our other seven childre n joined us. Relatives and neighbors streamed into our home. Somebody insisted that it couldn't be Yigal, that \"Gali\" (his nickname) was visiting a friend. But th en a broadcast showed a clear image of my son in the custody of the police. There was no mistake: That was my Yigal. As we sat, dazed, in front of the television , a swarm of Shin Bet agents burst into the living room, charged upstairs to Yigal's r oom, and took it apart from floor to ceiling. In the streets outside, hundreds of neighbors gathe red at the edge of our yard. Reporters and television crews soon joined them. My youngest children were crying uncontrollably. The phone rang off the hook that ni ght, and it has not stopped since. Daybreak brought the peculiar combination of unreal ity and routine that is painfully familiar to anyone who has experienced a family tra gedy. For years I have managed a nursery school in our home for neighborhood childre n. Forty preschoolers had enrolled that autumn. At 8 A.M. parents began to ar rive with their toddlers; all but a few came that day. Later, the Shin Bet returned to raid the house. Con cealed in the rafters, in a backyard shed, and in an underground cache they found weapon s and ammunition. The agents seemed to revel in our shock at each new discovery. At one point I asked one of them why he was spending so much time examining several bars of soap found in the house. He showed me the explosives that were hidden inside . And then they arrested my firstborn son, Hagai, on suspicion of being an acco mplice in the assassination of Rabin. Several of Yigal's and Hagai's friends and s choolmates were also hauled in for questioning."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":" 297 I had lived through four wars and the terrifying Ir aqi Scud missiles that struck Israel—just miles from our home—during the Persian Gulf War. But the fear I now felt was something entirely different. In wartime w e had been part of a brave and unified community; now I felt that it was my family 's own battle—that our family stood alone. Politicians and newspaper columnists b randed us a family of \"religious fanatics\" and \"extremists,\" never pausing to distin guish between us and Yigal. Leading the attacks against us was Rabin's former c hief of staff Eitan Haber, who showed up at one of the early court hearings for Yi gal and announced that he wouldn't leave the \"Amir family in peace until the end of [h is] days.\" Haber's pledge helped inspire a new round of telephone harassment against us, and our home was attacked by vandals. When the news leaked out that my oldest daughter, V ardit, would soon be married, Haber was on her trail. Needless to say, we were in no mood for celebrations, but according to Jewish religious tradition, once a wed ding date has been set it cannot be postponed; Vardit's wedding date had been decided o n six months earlier. Haber called for protesters to show up by the thousands. To our amazement, Haber's plan backfired. There was a spontaneous outpouring of sympathy for our family. Gifts began to arrive from anonymous well-wishers. People we did not know called to offer us help. A stranger lent the young couple a new car for their honeymoon. Nearly every one of our invite d guests showed up. In Jewish tradition the righteous are rewarded with a place in the world to come, and those who are sinful are punished until their souls have been cleansed. When I was a little girl, my grandfather, a revered rabbinical s age, would tell me stories about rare individuals whose sins were so grievous that they c ould not even enter purgatory. Such a soul, termed a dybbuk in Hebrew, is sent bac k to the earthly realm to repair the spiritual damage it has wreaked. The dybbuk's only hope is to infiltrate and possess the body of a living person and cling tightly to th is purer soul in the hope of securing enough credit, through that person's meritorious de eds, to be forgiven for his own misdeeds. In the spring of 1992, a baneful dybbuk t ook possession of Israel's radical right-wing political movements and almost succeeded in driving them to ruin. This dybbuk's name was Avishai Raviv. Raviv was a part of Yigal's other world-his world a way from home-and I didn't realize what a central role he played in my son's life unti l his name began cropping up again and again as the Israeli press probed deeper into t he Rabin assassination. Avishai Raviv was born in 1967 in Holon, a backwate r development town just south of Tel Aviv. He is remembered in Holon as a youngst er who made up for his shyness and stuttering by playing practical jokes on his cl assmates. Raviv's family was not religious and tended to vote Labor. His life change d suddenly and dramatically when, at the age of 16, he attended a lecture by Rabbi Me ir Kahane, the fiery leader of the Israeli nationalist Kach movement. Raviv became act ive in the movement and, under Rabbi Kahane's influence, seemed to undergo a relig ious awakening that resulted in his embracing traditional Judaism. While on leave f rom service in the Israeli army's elite Givati Brigade, Raviv began attending demonst rations and other Kach activities."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":" 298 Subsequent Israeli and foreign media reports allege d that at some time during or immediately following his military service, Raviv w as recruited as an informer for the Shin Bet. Raviv, however, was no ordinary snitch. I t was reported that for five years he initiated, organized, and led dozens of extremis t right-wing activities. After the November 1990 assassination of Rabbi Kaha ne, the Kach movement split into two factions. Raviv managed to remain active i n both. He consistently appeared at each group's events and soon became an infamous fixture on the nightly news. When scuffles broke out with the police or hostile passersby, Raviv was often in the center of the trouble and was arrested dozens of ti mes (although he was rarely charged and never imprisoned). While he was active in the various Kach splinters, Raviv joined the Temple Mount Faithful, a group that protests for Jewish rights o n the Temple Mount, the Jewish holy site in Jerusalem upon which Muslims built the Al A qsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock shrine. Israelis must get permission from the police before they can pray on the mount for fear of violence between Arabs and Jews, and the Temple Mount Faithful has responded with protests. Raviv's attempt to wre st control from the founder of the group would lead to his expulsion. Raviv's agitation led to a particularly ugly episod e in August 1991 during a protest outside the Tel Aviv office of Israel's Communist p arty. As Tamar Gozansky, a Communist member of the Knesset (the Israeli parlia ment), left the building, Raviv charged at her with a large metal flagpole. Gozansk y's aide blocked the assault, and a brawl ensued. Photos of a bloodied Raviv limping aw ay from the rally enhanced his stature among the Kahane activists. Raviv was arres ted, but it took nearly four years for the case to go to court. He was let off with a mere nine months' probation and a small fine. The decision by Israeli prosecutors to request probation rather than imprisonment seemed curious. In the meantime, Raviv had enrolled at Tel Aviv Uni versity and was busy making trouble on campus. When a Druse student was elected head of the student union (the largely Jewish student body had chosen a Muslim), R aviv publicly accused him of being disloyal to Israel. The university administra tion brought disciplinary charges against Raviv for racism. Eventually Raviv was expe lled from the university-but not before he asked the Office of the Prime Minister to intervene on his behalf Tel Aviv University officials, however, had had enough of hi s provocations and his appeal was rejected. Raviv then founded an organization with settlement activist David Hazan, called Eyal (the Jewish Fighting Organization). It was a religi ous-nationalist youth movement with barely two dozen members at the start. But Rav iv devoted all of his energy to recruiting new members. He soon built himself a sma ll but loyal following, made up primarily of religious teenagers. Raviv lured these youngsters with the enticement of violence and rebellion. According to one girl's lat er testimony, the charismatic Raviv would arrange Sabbath weekend retreats for Eyal mem bers in various Jewish settlements. I believe the cost of these weekends w as usually footed by Raviv. Before long, Raviv was quarreling with Hazan over t he group's direction. Hazan thought Raviv went too far at times, and, reportedl y, when Raviv started to openly"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":" 299 discuss assassinating a prominent Israeli, Hazan re signed. Raviv took over and shaped Eyal into his vision of the militant vanguard of th e Israeli Right. His former roommate, Eran Ojalbo, claimed that Raviv was obsessed with o btaining publicity for himself and his small band of followers and developed a rea l flair for media stunts. On one occasion, Raviv invited a television crew to watch Eyal members training with weapons. On another, he launched a well-publicized leafleting campaign against mixed Jewish-Arab classes in public schools. He and several Eyal teenagers were brought in for police questioning. Leaflets of this sort are illegal in Israel because they're considered racist, and those who are respon sible for creating them are often prosecuted. With Raviv, no charges were pressed. In September 1993, the Rabin government signed the Oslo accords with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The accords, and the series of terror bombings that followed their implementation, brought thousands of previously apolitical Israelis into the streets and onto the barricades in embittered p rotest. These neophyte activists poured into the pre-existing right-wing groups and placed themselves at the disposal of experienced organizers such as Avishai Raviv. On e of these new activists was my son Yigal. The election of Labor party leader Yitzhak Rabin as prime minister in 1992 was the climax of an extraordinary political comeback. Afte r four straight national election losses and more than 15 years in the political wild erness, Rabin led the center-left Labor parry to triumph. Like many Israelis, my husband and I were saddened by Rabin's election, but we sought consolation in the platform upon which he ra n: no negotiations with the PLO, no establishment of a PLO state, and no surrender o f the strategically vital Golan Heights. If Rabin adhered to his party's declared p rinciples, Israel's basic security needs would be protected. In utter disregard of Rabin's platform and in defia nce of the Israeli law prohibiting contact with the PLO, Labor party emissaries initia ted negotiations with the terrorist group. In September 1993, Rabin announced to a stun ned nation that he was going to sign an agreement with PLO chairman Yasir Arafat, g iving the PLO partial control over Judea, Samaria, and Gaza. He also planned to r elease jailed terrorists in exchange for a PLO peace pledge. In Israel, we hoped desperately that peace would em erge. As a wife and a mother, I know the pain and fear of having watched my sons go off to serve the mandatory three years in the Israeli army. I yearn for the da y when we can beat our swords into plowshares. Sadly, the Oslo process did not produce the peace w e expected. Within weeks of the White House handshake, the horror began. A Palestin ian terrorist drove a car filled with explosives into a bus near the community of Be it-El, wounding 30 people. Next, a Palestinian driving a car filled with explosives pulled up alongside a bus in the northern Israeli city of Afula. The explosion kille d eight people and wounded dozens more. On Remembrance Day, a Palestinian suicide bom ber boarded a bus in nearby Hadera and blew himself up, killing five and woundi ng 25. Public support for Rabin and the Oslo process plummeted. Labor had insisted that the agreement would bring"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":" 300 Israel untold benefits. But such dreams were shatte red by the rude reality of the old Middle East. At the same time, a dangerous schism was emerging i n Israeli society between those who continued to support the peace process and thos e who opposed it. Faced with widespread public rejection of the Oslo process, an increasingly defensive Rabin and his cabinet ministers responded by forging ahead wi th policies that did not have the support of the public majority. The terror continued. On October 19, 1994, in the h eart of Tel Aviv, a Hamas bomber blew up a bus, killing 22 passengers and wounding 4 8. Three weeks later a terrorist riding a bicycle and carrying a knapsack filled wit h explosives pedaled up to an army checkpoint in Gaza and killed three soldiers. Each week brought more death, violence, and disillusionment. Around our Sabbath dinner tabl e, the one time each week when all of our children were together, there was a grow ing sense of despair. Yigal once said, almost in tears, \"Who cares if you can now ta ke a vacation trip to Jordan if the street outside is running with Jewish blood?\" We di dn't know how to answer him. But we did not quite understand just how deeply he felt the pain of the massacred victims. We could not imagine that these terrible events wer e pushing him past the point of no return. In the summer of 1995, as Rabin entered the fourth and final year of his term, his popularity was rapidly declining and his coalition government had to count on the support of five Arab members in the Knesset for its survival, though he could not be assured of these crucial votes indefinitely. And th ere was turmoil inside the Labor party itself Rabin had indicated his willingness to surrender most or all of the Golan Heights region to the Syrians, and a handful of Lab or members of the Knesset, led by the 1973 war hero Avigdor Kahalani, balked. Recalli ng how the Syrians had used the Golan from 1949 to 1967 to shell northern Israel, t he Kahalani faction announced that it would vote against the government if it sought t o surrender the Golan. Throughout the spring and summer of 1995, Likud lea der Benjamin Netanyahu began to rise in the polls. By late summer of 1995, the p olls showed that if elections were held at that time, Netanyahu. would be elected prim e minister. The polls found that a majority of the nation no longer supported new terr itorial surrender. With elections less than a year away, Rabin's caree r appeared to be on the verge of ruin, and it's my belief that the Labor leadership quietly turned to the security services to help stave off a defeat at the polls. The dybbuk in our story will now be joined by an au thentic spook. Karmi Gillon came from one of Israel's prominent families. His grandf ather, Gad Frumkin, had served as a Supreme Court justice during the pre-state years under the British Mandate. Gillon's father, Colin, was Israel's state attorney during t he 1950s, and his mother, Saada, was a deputy attorney general. Gillon's brother, Alon, is a judge who serves as the registrar of Israel's Supreme Court. Karmi Gillon forsook the family profession for a career in the Shin Bet. Created shortly after Israel's birth, the Shin Bet is, in effect, the Israeli FBI and Secret Service combined; it is charged with the tasks of gathering domestic intelligence, counterespionage, and protecting dipl omats and VIPs. Control of the Shin Bet is in the hands of the office of the prime minister."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":" 301 The Shin Bet like the FBI, has had no small share o f controversy over the years. During the time that Gillon was rising in its ranks , the Shin Bet was implicated in a series of scandals. The Landau Commission, establis hed in 1987 to investigate the methods of the Shin Bet, found a pattern of perjury spanning almost two decades. It released an 88 page report sharply censured the Shi n Bet leadership for having \"failed by not understanding that no security operation, ho wever vital, can put its operatives above the law.\" The commission characterized the Sh in Bet's lawlessness as a danger to democratic society. Karmi Gillon had a unique field of expertise. While most of his fellow agents spent their time combating the threat of Arab terrorism, Gillon was the Shin Bet's resident expert on Jewish extremist groups; he even wrote hi s master's thesis at Haifa University on the topic in 1990. He was an advocate of cracking down on Jewish nationalist movements and made no secret of his ant ipathy to the right-wing outlook. A few months prior to Gillon's appointment as chief of the Shin Bet in February 1995, Avishai Raviv pulled off an extraordinary stunt. Ra viv, accompanied by a band of former Kach activists, attempted to stage a demonst ration outside Gillon's Jerusalem home to demand his resignation from the Shin Bet. R aviv and two other people were briefly detained as they approached Gillon's house. Raviv told reporters at the scene— I believe he tipped off the press—that the planned- demonstration was \"to protest that the head of the Shin Bet is being used as a politic al tool against the right wing.\" To some, Raviv's threatening behavior was just furt her \"evidence\" that the Jewish Right was a menace that had to be combatted. In fac t, Raviv, as it was later alleged, was already serving as an informer for the Shin Bet , and I find it hard to believe that his stunt hadn't been cleared by Gillon himself. Ev en before Gillon assumed control of the service, Raviv's provocations had become com pletely unrestrained. According to the Jerusalem Post, a few days after the machine -gunning of 29 Palestinians by Dr. Baruch Goldstein in March 1994 at Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs, Raviv rented an apartment—directly above the one where Goldstein ha d lived—in Kiryat Arba. While Kiryat Arba's leaders were denouncing Goldstein, Ra viv was boasting about his admiration for him. According to the Post, one of R aviv's splinter groups, DOV [Suppression of Traitors], vandalized a car belongi ng to the Kiryat Arba council head, Zvi Katzover, and the next day, Eyal took credit fo r assaulting Katzover's son so seriously that the boy had to be hospitalized. Agai n, Raviv was not prosecuted. Raviv was then accepted by Bar-Ilan University, an Orthodox Jewish institution located in Ramat Gan, not far from Tel Aviv. Raviv registered for several history and philosophy courses and also enrolled in the school' s Institute for Advanced Torah Studies. It was there, in the spring of 1994, that he met my son Yigal. By the time summer rolled around, Raviv was sponsor ing a paramilitary Eyal summer camp for militant youngsters. Reporters were invite d to watch as Raviv ordered his young recruits, armed with automatic weapons, pisto ls, and knives, to engage in paramilitary drills and martial-arts training. Throughout 1994, my husband and I were aware that Y igal was becoming increasingly involved in political activities. But as long as his actions were within the law (and to my knowledge, they were) and he kept up his grades (and he did), we saw"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":" 302 no reason to object. If Yigal felt that the Oslo pr ocess was endangering Israel—and many, many Israelis felt that way—it was his right, even his obligation, to protest. What we did not know was that Yigal was being drawn into Raviv's netherworld. Raviv was blanketing the campus with extremist post ers. He clashed with campus security when some of the more militant notices wer e taken down by guards. This resulted in a hearing before an academic disciplina ry committee that issued a warning: He would be expelled if he caused any more trouble. In the summer of 1995, Raviv was once more summoned to a disciplinary committee for his activities. Raviv was again let off with a mere warning by the university administration. Acquaintances from that period late r told me that he had behaved as if he had protectzia, the Hebrew slang for pull, or in fluence in high places. The rabbis at the Institute for Advanced Torah Studies, however, had seen enough of Raviv's antics. He was expelled from the institute. In Hebrew, Yigal means \"he will redeem.\" My second son was born during those first heady years after the Six Day War, when Israel, on the brink of annihilation by the Arab armies, miraculously beat back the enemy and l iberated sacred territories that are so central to Judaism and Jewish history: Judea , Samaria, Gaza, the Golan Heights, and, of course, Jerusalem. God had redeemed his nat ion, and we named our second child Yigal as an affirmation of that miracle. Even as a young child, Yigal displayed an energy and drive that set him apart from other c hildren. Whatever Yigal wanted, he found a way to get. Yigal had never given us a day of trouble in his li fe. After graduating at the top of his high school class, he began his military service. H is fierce patriotism compelled him to volunteer for an elite combat unit. As a mother, I dreaded his decision to serve in the unit that is called into battle first when war breaks out. But how could we stand in the way of our son's desire to defend his country? When Yigal finished his three mandatory years of se rvice, I detected a new seriousness in him. He was hired as a government em issary to Latvia, where he taught Hebrew to potential Jewish immigrants to Israel. He subsequently told me that this is where he was trained by the Shin Bet. Upon his return, Yigal gained admission to law scho ol at Bar-Ilan. For a young man of Yemenitc background, this was quite an accomplis hment: Jews from Yemen and other Arab countries start out at the bottom of Isr ael's socioeconomic ladder, and it has taken decades to break into professions dominat ed by those of European origin. Yigal enrolled not only in the Bar-Ilan University law school but simultaneously in its computer classes and the university's religious-stu dies program. Like many of his fellow students, Yigal was drawn t o political activism by the Oslo accords. He attended a number of mass demonstration s in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and helped organize a number of campus rallies, but he soon despaired of their impact because there was no chance of changing Rabin's min d. Yigal found himself overwhelmed by a sense of frust ration, and this helped to pave the way for his association with Raviv. He was now spending a good deal of his time"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":" 303 organizing Sabbath weekend retreats for student act ivists in various Israeli towns and in the settlements. As Yigal's friends told me subs equently, he and Raviv worked together, publicizing the retreats, preparing liter ature for the discussion groups and seminars, and arranging for guest lecturers. We hardly saw Yigal during the summer and early aut umn of 1995. 1 couldn't imagine how he mustered the energy for such outings after his grueling schedule of classes. But if he was using his day and a half off from school (Israel's weekends last only from Friday afternoon until Saturday night) fo r educational purposes, we considered it worthwhile. According to Yigal's friends and others who have si nce testified in court, Raviv seemed to be obsessed with one topic: killing Rabin . He and Yigal frequently engaged in discussions about the feasibility of assassinati on. On September 16, Israeli television broadcast what was purported to be a secret late- night swearing-in ceremony organized by Eyal. At th e ceremony, which was later revealed to have been staged for the television cam eras, Raviv assembled what he claimed were a group of new Eyal recruits at the gr aves of pre-state Jewish underground fighters, according to the Jerusalem Po st. Raviv scored his biggest media triumph on October 5 ,1995, when the opposition political parties organized a mass rally in downtow n Jerusalem to protest the mounting Arab terror and the government's weak resp onse. Although I rarely attended demonstrations, Yigal and I went to, this one toget her. The main speaker that Saturday night was Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu. Circulating among the huge crowd was Avishai Raviv and his band of Eyal hothea ds. According to the Jerusalem Post, Raviv had given them handouts depicting Prime Minister Rabin dressed up in an SS uniform. When demonstrators urged the Eyal sign holders to remove the offensive placards, they refused. Eyal's founder, David Hazan , passed by and tore up one of the posters. A gang of Eyal toughs promptly pummeled hi m. The Post reported that an Israeli television report er, Nitzan Chen, later revealed that Raviv had approached him and urged him to broadcast the sign on the nightly news report, and that he had even called later to be sur e that it had been included. In the Knesset the next morning, the Labor party ma de good use of the poster. Netanyahu was accused of having failed to condemn t hem. It helped reinforce the notion that the Likud was extremist and irresponsib le. In a radio interview shortly afterward, Rabin told the public that \"the Likud pr ovides extremists with inspiration. It cannot wash its hands of this and claim it has n othing to do with it.\" Netanyahu's request to meet with Rabin to attempt t o ease the mounting political tensions was ignored. Rabin's refusal to even meet with the Likud leader again strengthened the idea that Netanyahu was beyond the pale. It also helped deflect public attention away from Arab terrorism. Finally, so it seemed, Rabin had found an effective campaign strategy. On November 4, 1995, Yigal exited a bus and made hi s way toward Malchei Yisrael Square, where thousands of supporters had already a ssembled. The large floodlights"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":" 304 placed outside the Tel Aviv city hall illuminated t he area for many blocks, and security was stepped up around the demonstration. O n hand were more than 700 police and border-patrol officers, dozens of underc over police, and agents of the Shin Bet who had been assigned the job of guarding the f eatured political leaders. The gathering, whose theme was \"Yes to peace, no to violence,\" had been heavily advertised for weeks. Labor party-dominated municip alities and unions pulled out all stops in their drive to generate a large turnout fo r the rally. Some of the biggest names in Israeli entertainment were recruited to perform. In addition to Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres, other top Labor leaders were present. It was meant to be an impressive show of strength for the party and pr oof positive that large segments of the country still supported the peace process. Yigal strode quickly through the crowd. The police had erected special metal railings to keep the crowd away from the rostrum, but people were simply walking around the barriers. When Yigal arrived near the stage he circ led around the police line and descended the stairway that led to the cordoned par king area, where the limousines of the prime minister and other government officials w ere parked. After a while, a Shin Bet agent approached and aske d Yigal who he was. He reportedly replied that he was one of the drivers. The agent apparently accepted the answer and walked away. At no point did anyone ask Yigal to produce identification or seriously challenge his presence near the cars. Much criticism was later leveled against the police and the Shin Bet for failing to create a \"sterile\" area near the stage, a standard security precaution. Yigal struck up a conversation with some of the dri vers and police officers who were mingling in the parking lot. Later they would admit that they had assumed he was either an undercover policeman or one of the entert ainers' drivers. From his position in the parking lot, Yigal could clearly hear the si nging of the performers. As the speeches and performances continued on the s tage above him, Yigal bided his time. He did not check his watch, nor did he displa y any anxiety, he told me. He said that if the police had stopped him or seriously que stioned him at this stage, he would have taken it as a sign from above and abandoned th e plan to kill Rabin. But on this evening there were no such actions by the police or Shin Bet agents. And so Yigal was content to peacefully wait for the rally to end and the prime minister to be escorted to his car. In the chaotic aftermath of the assassination, riva l Israeli law-enforcement officials engaged in a frenzy of finger-pointing and recrimin ations. In the newspapers and on the airwaves, the Police Ministry and the Shin Bet hurled accusations at one another, each attempting to blame the other for the lax secu rity. Shin Bet head Karmi Gillon, whose name was then a state secret, announced that the security services would conduct an internal investigation. The police annou nced their own internal probe. Astonishingly, within 48 hours—on November 7—the Sh in Bet report was concluded and leaked to the press. The document, which was au thored by three former branch heads of the Shin Bet, found that the entire protec tion system assigned to the prime minister had collapsed. The report lambasted the in ability of the Shin Bet to gather intelligence on extreme right-wing groups. After th e report's release, the head of the"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":" 305 protection department, identified as \"D,\" was force d to resign. The Shin Bet insisted that D's negligence was the sole reason for the pro cedural breaches on the night of the killing. On Tuesday, November 7, Raviv was arrested by the p olice, on charges that he was involved in the assassination. The Jerusalem Post a sserted that his group, Eyal, was being investigated in connection with a conspiracy to kill the prime minister. As the handcuffed Raviv was brought to court under heavy p olice guard, he yelled to reporters, \"This is a political investigation and a false arrest! This is a dictatorship!\" The next day, the government announced the formatio n of a commission of inquiry into the assassination, to be headed by former Supr eme Court justice Meir Shamgar. And from the outset, the Shamgar Commission was pla gued by conflicts of interest and questions of impartiality. Shamgar himself had served for many years as Judge Advocate General of the Israeli army and maintained ties to the military establishment. He was also a close personal friend of the Rabin fa mily. Shamgar was joined on the panel by a former head of the Mossad, Zvi Zamir, an d Professor Ariel Rosen-Zvi, dean of Tel Aviv University law school. Professor R osen-Zvi was in the advanced stages of cancer at the time and would be dead with in weeks of the commission's final report. In a strange twist, Judge Alon Gillon, the older br other of Shin Bet head Karmi Gillon, was named secretary of the commission. Sitting in o n the commission's proceedings was the brother of the government official who was most likely to be blamed if the commission concluded that the Shin Bet had failed t o safeguard Rabin. The possible conflict of interest apparently escaped the notice of the commissioners—Karmi Gillon would testify before the commission at length. Unfo rtunately, neither the public nor the news media were allowed to attend many of the c ommission's hearings. Equally troubling was the presence of Attorney Gene ral Michael Ben-Yair. Since the commission was investigating, among other issues, w hether the attorney general's office was granting some Shin Bet informants—one of which was later alleged to be Raviv—immunity from prosecution, the presence of th e attorney general at the hearings was surprising indeed. If the government's intent was to definitively ascertain what led to Rabin's assassination, then e ven the perception of impropriety should not have been tolerated. During the days following the assassination, Attorn ey General Ben-Yair had ordered a crackdown on individuals who were suspected of enga ging in \"inflammatory speech.\" Curiously, the crackdown continued for several week s, then stopped suddenly. Ben- Yair announced—in a stunning reversal—that mere wor ds could not cause an individual to engage in criminal acts, and they had not caused Yigal's act. \"The person who killed the prime minister did not do so under t he influence of incitement.... He acted due to a complete worldview, which he had dev eloped.... It wasn't because of a poster here or there.\" Ben-Yair was not the only on e to engage in a sudden, unexplained about-face. Police Minister Moshe Shaha l, who had previously declared, \"We believe that a group of people carefully prepar ed the ground to conspire to murder carefully chosen targets,\" now asserted that Yigal was a lone gunman who had organized the assassination on his own."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":" 306 But the \"inciting rhetoric\" and \"organized conspira cy\" theories had served their purpose they had inflamed public opinion against th e Israeli Right. Now, I believe they needed to be discarded lest they open an even bigger can of worms about incitement and conspiracy. On the weekend before the Shamgar Commission was to hear its first witness, Karmi Gillon, there was a stunning revelation: Israeli te levision and radio both reported that Raviv was, indeed, an undercover agent for the Shin Bet. According to the reports, Raviv, codenamed \"Champagne\" by his Shin Bet handle rs, had been on the government's payroll for at least two years as a to p infiltrator of the far Right. But according to an investigation by the Jerusalem Post , Raviv's task involved much more than infiltration: His orders were to attract indiv iduals to Eyal, incite them to illegal activities, and then inform on them to the Shin Bet . One of the sources of this information was Rabbi Be nny Elon, the dean of Yeshivat Beit Orot, a religious college, and son of a retire d Supreme Court justice. Elon would later become a Knesset member in 1996. This promine nt Jewish-settlement activist and leader of the right-wing group Moledet held a p ress conference and charged that Raviv had effectively manufactured the wild far Rig ht. He was, in Elon's words, an \"agent provocateur,\" carrying out a mission by the government to discredit the right- wing opposition, including, by association, the Lik ud. \"I would venture to say,\" Elon added, \"that the whole organization [Eyal] and its activities, including the poster depicting Rabin in an SS uniform, were all paid for by the Shin Bet.\" (The Shin Bet later denied the charge.) Elon went on to say, \"The re is a reasonable suspicion that [Raviv's activity] was okayed by the legal authorit y.\" Elon, who had met Raviv and other Eyal activists on a number of occasions at demonstrations and elsewhere, said that Raviv had b een Yigal's constant companion in the months prior to the killing. How could Raviv have been so close to Yigal and not known, as Raviv later claimed in court, of the assassination plan? And how could a Shin Bet informer have been so closely involved i n all of these activities without the knowledge of the Shin Bet, which is supervised by t he Office of the Prime Minister? The two weeks after the assassination were the most horrible period of my life. Now, suddenly, came the revelation of a Shin Bet connect ion to Yigal's \"pal\" Raviv. The Likud, which had been on the defensive since th e assassination, came to life in the wake of the Raviv-Shin Bet accusations. At a me eting of the Likud executive bureau, Netanyahu called for \"a full, thorough, and exhaustive investigation into the Raviv affair. There must be no coverup. Even if onl y a fraction of the provocative activities attributed to Raviv are true, they const itute a grave danger to democracy. There must be an investigation, and it must come no w, with no delays and no excuses.\" And then there were more revelations. Israel's lead ing daily, Yediot Ahronot, reported that in testimony before a closed session of the Sh amgar Commission, several young women at a religious seminary said that they had re cognized Yigal and Raviv from a Sabbath retreat at Ma'aleh Yisrael the previous sum mer. The girls told their teacher, Sarah Eliash, that Raviv had denounced several Rabi n government officials as \"traitors.\" During several marathon ideological dis cussions that weekend, Raviv had"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":" 307 attempted to goad Yigal into killing Rabin, ridicul ing his \"cowardice\" for not being willing to assassinate a \"traitor.\" In court, Raviv said he had heard Yigal talk about the \"need to kill Rabin\" but claimed he hadn't take n him seriously. The girls testified: \"We used to see Raviv and Amir on Saturdays during last summer. These gatherings were arranged by Yigal. We would s it out on a hilltop there. There were no demonstrations or any violence. They were b asically study groups. We met, like, several times.... Raviv was real macho. He ke pt saying to Yigal, 'You keep talking about killing Rabin. Why don't you do it? A re you frightened? You say you want to do it. Show us that you're a man! Show us w hat you are made of\"' The girls testified that Yigal didn't react at all to Raviv's pressure and just changed the subject of discussion. Suddenly, information about Raviv was spilling fort h. Raviv's former roommate in Kiryat Arba, and former member of Eyal, Eran Ojalbo , testified as a witness for the defense at Yigal's trial. He revealed that Raviv ha d said that Rabin was a rodef—the Hebrew term for someone who endangers others and th erefore should be killed. At a weekend retreat organized by Yigal in the settlemen t of Ma'alch Yisrael, press reports say, Raviv had marked several different government leaders for death. Ojalbo also testified that ten minutes after news o f the assassination had been announced, Raviv called him and asked how he was an d if he knew who had shot Rabin. Ojalbo responded that in television reports he had seen that it was \"a short Yemenite guy.\" Raviv asked if it was Yigal. \"I look ed again,\" Ojalbo testified, \"and said that it was Yigal.\" Ojalbo also maintained that Raviv had verbally pres sured Yigal to attempt an assassination of Rabin. \"Raviv told Yigal and other s, time and time again, that there was a din-rodef [judgment] on Yitzhak Rabin. He sai d, 'Rabin should die,' and whoever killed him was a righteous person.... Raviv had a powerful influence on Yigal. He continuously emphasized to him and other students that whoever implemented the din-rodef against Rabin was carryin g out a holy mission.\" Israel television's Chen appeared before the Shamga r Commission and related the details of Raviv's involvement with the SS handouts . Raviv's job was to discredit the Right, Chen said, and what could be more effective than giving the public the idea that the entire opposition considered Rabin to be a Nazi? The next Raviv revelation came from the Jerusalem P ost investigative reporter Steve Rodan. He reported that \"Israel Broadcasting Author ity spokesman [Ayala Cohen] said the first report of the Rabin shooting was bro adcast at 9:48 P.M. Channel 1 began broadcasting live at 10:15, and 15 minutes later, t he alleged assassin was identified as a 25-year-old student from Herzliyya.\" But Rodan also wrote that Raviv had arrived at the Tel Aviv rally 15 minutes before Rabin's murder. When the first rumors of the shooti ng swept through the crowd, at 9:50 P.M., Rodan reported, \"Immediately Raviv pulle d out his mobile telephone and spoke to an unidentified person. 'He called somebod y,' one of the witnesses said. 'He asked whether they shot Rabin.' Then Raviv asked, ' Was he hurt?'.... When he finished [the conversation] he shouted, 'It was Yig al. Don't you know Yigal? He was"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":" 308 at the Orient House demonstrations [Eyal's protests at PLO headquarters in Jerusalem].' Raviv then made his way toward nearby Ichilov Hospital and then disappeared.\" \"Those around him could not understand how Raviv kn ew the identity of the assassin before anyone else,\" Rodan reported. As the accusations about Raviv mounted, the opposit ion Tsomet party petitioned the High Court of Justice to prevent Attorney General B en-Yair from attending further Shamgar Commission hearings. The petition asked tha t, at a minimum, Ben-Yair be prohibited from questioning witnesses, including Sh in Bet agents and confidential informants, whose activities he might have authoriz ed. The petition also argued that since Ben-Yair might himself be called to testify, it was improper for him to become familiar with others' testimony. Instead of ruling on the merits of the petition, th e High Court offered a compromise proposal under which Tsomet would withdraw its peti tion in exchange for a promise that Ben-Yair would absent himself if a conflict of interest arose. But it was a disappointing action by the Court, and it did littl e to restore the image of the commission. The growing public perception was that Ben-Yair was sitting in on the commission hearings to conduct damage control for t he government in the wake of the Raviv-Shin Bet revelations. On December 14, Raviv himself appeared before the S hamgar Commission. After completing his secret testimony, he was whisked awa y in a government car and vanished from public view. Following Raviv's testimony, the commission issued warning letters to six Shin Bet officials, including Karmi Gillon. The letters caut ioned the officials that they might face criminal liability as a result of their involv ement with the events surrounding Raviv and the Rabin murder. Gillon and several othe r Shin Bet agents were called back for additional testimony, in light of Raviv's statements to the commission. On January 8, 1996, Karmi Gillon resigned. The Isra eli media concluded that had he not stepped down voluntarily, the Shamgar Commissio n would have insisted on his removal. The man who had been championed as an expe rt on Jewish extremism had failed to examine and follow up on information that he had received regarding a possible attack on the prime minister by Jewish ext remists. But what was widely perceived as Gillon's negligence explained only a f raction of the events that led to the assassination. Why hadn't the Shin Bet ordered Ravi v to cease his provocations? Why had it not detained or at least questioned Yigal be fore he acted? Why the strange restraint in the face of a threat to the prime mini ster? The Jerusalem Post reported: \"Yigal told investigat ors that he acted alone, did not belong to an extremist organization, and had 'recei ved instructions from God to kill Prime Minister Rabin.'\" Yigal also reiterated in co urt that he acted alone. I believe he did so in order not to implicate others. On March 28, 1996, the Shamgar Commission released its report. Of the 332 pages, 118 were declared classified. The unclassified part s blamed Gillon for the failures of"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":" 309 the Shin Bet on the night of the murder but did not find him or any other agents criminally negligent. According to the Jerusalem Po st, the unclassified sections contained only a few scattered references to the re lationship between the running of agents and the Shin Bet. The report depicted the as sassination as a failure by the agents protecting Rabin to organize themselves effe ctively. In one of its least believable conclusions, the Shamgar report claimed that Gillon—the expert on right- wing Jewish extremism—\"did not conduct even one sub stantive, relevant, thorough, and comprehensive discussion with all the security and intelligence-gathering bodies to review methods.\" This was after two senior Shin Bet officers told the commission that they had gathered intelligence reports that ri ght-wing groups could be a threat to both Jews and Arabs. Equally bizarre was the commission's assertion that in order to \"safeguard\" the Shin Bet's operational methods, testimony by or about Ra viv and his role had to be placed in a classified appendix to the report. In Chapter 5 of the commission's report is a section entitled \"The Avishai Raviv Episode.\" The p age is blank except for the cryptic note that \"the details of this subject will be disc ussed in the secret appendix.\" A section entitled \"The Operation of Agents\" states : \"The body that operates an informer must keep tight control of him and not all ow him to initiate actions at his will ... and to prevent the carrying out of provoca tions that in the end might have a boomerang effect.\" Could they have been referring t o Raviv? The official investigation of Raviv's relationship with Yigal remains shrouded in secrecy. Labor, of course, wanted no further probin g into a potentially explosive scandal. Ironically, Likud, having forced national elections in two months, preferred to put the issue to rest. The idea of using an agent provocateur was not orig inated by the Shin Bet. The secret police in czarist Russia created fake anarchist cel ls in order to attract genuine anarchist militants whom they would arrest and exec ute. When the Soviets came to power, they employed the same tactic against their political enemies. In the United States, the FBI created COINTELPRO (the counterinte lligence program) to recruit potential lawbreakers, help incite them to break th e law, then arrest them. By the late 1970s, the use of such unscrupulous tactics had bee n exposed and widely condemned as improper interference with citizens' rights. In Israel, unfortunately, dirty tricks are still commonly used. Neither the Shin Bet nor the political echelon that controls it, the Office of the Prime Minister, seems to have appreciated the difference between a legitimate informant and an agent provocateur. I believe Raviv enjoyed the full backing and protec tion of the Shin Bet. He assaulted a member of the Knesset and did not serve a day in ja il. The Office of the Prime Minister was contacted to help intervene in an atte mpt to prevent his expulsion from Tel Aviv University. He emerged scot-free from dist ributing racist literature, publicly praising Baruch Goldstein, holding illegal summer m ilitia camps, and allegedly distributing the Rabin-SS poster. On many occasions , he allegedly urged the assassination of Rabin and other Labor government o fficials and was never"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":" 310 prosecuted. Raviv's lawlessness had to have sent th e message to potential extremists that violence could be employed with impunity. As I see it, Karmi Gillon and Avishai Raviv were th e perfect match: Gillon, the Shin Bet chief obsessed with the belief that right-wing Jewish terrorist groups were on the loose; and Raviv, the alleged Shin Bet informer act ively ensuring that Gillon's dark prophesies came true. If Raviv was an informer, did he alert Shin Bet agents that Yigal was now a potential assassin? I find it incon ceivable that he would have kept such information to himself. Yet Yigal was never ar rested. Never questioned. Never had his gun license revoked. Never had his gun conf iscated. Did Gillon know from Raviv about Yigal's activities? If so, why didn't h e order his agents to undertake any action against Yigal? What were they waiting for? Just minutes after Yigal had shot the prime ministe r, somebody called reporters, identified himself as a spokesman for a right-wing organization, and claimed, \"This time we missed. Next time we won't.\" It seems aston ishing to me that the caller could have known that the shots were fired by a right-win g Jew rather than an Arab. Why did he think that the attack had failed? Could the caller have been Raviv? I think he spent months inciting Yigal to make the attempt. He may have suspected that it would take p lace that night. I also think that he positioned himself at the rally, close enough to th e scene of the crime to know that the shots had been fired, enabling him to make the imme diate calls to the reporters. (One wonders what might emerge from an investigation of the itemized bill of Raviv's cellular phone.) Yet, for some reason, Raviv was sure that the attem pt would fail. Why? Perhaps somebody—either Raviv or someone else—was surreptit iously supposed to have disabled Yigal's gun, either by removing the firing pin or by replacing the bullets with blanks, before the shooting. It has been claimed in court that it was Yigal who shouted, \"Blanks! Blanks!\" But Shin Bet agents are trained t o shout out \"Blanks! Blanks!\" in security drills. And I believe that that cry, combi ned with the fact that an agent assured Mrs. Rabin that the gun was not real, might mean that the Shin Bet were expecting an unsuccessful assassination attempt. The Shin Bet could have arrested Yigal at any time in the weeks before the rally and charged him with plotting to kill Rabin. But the im pact on the public would be so much more dramatic if Shin Bet agents heroically fo iled an attempt on the prime minister's life. But something went terribly wrong. The bullets were not blanks; the gun was not a toy. My belief has some basis in past events. Foiling at tempted crimes at the last second is a well-established Shin Bet method. In April 1984, in a Shin Bet operation, agents were tracking a group of settlement leaders who wer e engaged in retaliatory attacks against Arab terrorists. They followed the suspects as they planted explosives on several Arab buses in East Jerusalem. After this, t he suspects were allowed to travel back to their residences. Only then did the Shin Be t raid their houses and conduct arrests. At the time, it was reported that the Shin Bet delayed taking suspects into custody until after the bombs were planted in order to sensationalize their own heroic efforts. Faced with the shocking news story, then p rime minister Yitzhak Shamir had"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":" 311 no choice but to let the security services arrest d ozens of other suspects and crack down on the settlement organizations. More recently, there is the disturbing case of the Kahalani brothers, Eitan and Yehoyada, from Kiryat Arba. The two men were convic ted of plotting to shoot an Arab in retaliation for the murder of a Jewish sett ler. The pair had taken their loaded rifles to a road near the village of Kafr Batir, wh ere they spotted an Arab man on a bicycle. As the Arab approached their truck, Eitan raised his rifle to fire, but the gun malfunctioned and Shin Bet agents waiting in ambush rushed to arrest the two brothers. The charge sheet is revealing. It contend s that the murder was dramatically foiled \"as a result of the removal of the firing pi n by GSS [Shin Bet] without prior knowledge of the accused, [hence] no shot was fired .\" The Kahalanis' attorney argued that a third individ ual involved in planning the attack was a Shin Bet plant who had disabled the guns. The alleged informant was arrested and then quickly released despite the charge that h e was involved in the conspiracy. Why did the Shin Bet wait until after Eitan Kahalan i had pulled the trigger to move in and make the arrest? What Israel needs now is to heal the terrible wound s that the nation has suffered as a result of the assassination and its aftermath. To e ase the malaise that is eating away at our society. To restore the public's confidence in our government. And, above all, to preserve the principles that are the basis of our d emocratic way of life. My concern for the lives and the freedom of my two sons ensures that I will not rest until the truth—about Avishai Raviv, the Shin Bet a nd my son Yigal—is fully revealed.
