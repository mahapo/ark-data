[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" PREFACE This is the third and final vol ume of a trilogy descri bing the role of the American corporate socialists, otherwise known as the Wall Street financial elite or the Eastern Liberal Establishment, in three signi ficant twentieth-century histor ical events: the 1917 Lenin- Trotsky Revolution in Russia, the 1933 election of Franklin D. Roos evelt in the United States, and the 1933 seizure of power by Adolf Hitler in Germany. Each of these events introduced some vari ant of socialism into a major country — i.e., Bolshevik socialism in Russia, New Deal so cialism in the United States, and National socialism in Germany. Contemporary academic histories, with perhap s the sole exception of Carroll Quigley's Tragedy And Hope, ignore this evidence. On the ot her hand, it is understandable that universities and research organizations, depende nt on financial aid from foundations that are controlled by this same New York financial elite, would hardly want to support and to publish research on these aspects of international politics. The br avest of trustees is unlikely to bite the hand that feeds his organization. It is also eminently clear from the evidence in this trilogy th at \"public-spirited businessmen\" do not journey to Washington as lobbyists and administrators in order to serv e the United States. They are in Washington to serve their own profit-maximizing interests. Their purpose is not to further a competitive, free-market economy, but to manipulate a politicized regime, call it what you will, to their own advantage. It is business manipulation of Hitler's accession to power in March 1933 that is the topic of Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler. ANTONY C.

(Testimony before United States Senate, Committee on Military Affairs, 1946.) The post-World War II Kilgore Committee of the United States Senate heard detailed evidence from government offi cials to the effect that, ...when the Nazis came to power in 1933, they found that l ong strides had been made since 1918 in preparing Germany for war from an economic and industrial point of view. 1 This build-up for European war both before and after 1933 was in great part due to Wall Street financial assistan ce in the 1920s to create the German cartel system, and to technical assistance from well-known Amer ican firms which will be identified later, to build the German Wehrmacht. Whereas this financial and technical assistance is referred to as \"accidental\" or due to the \"short-sightedne ss\" of American businessmen, the evidence presented below strongly suggests some degr ee of premeditation on the part of these American financiers. Similar a nd unacceptable pleas of \"accide nt\" were made on behalf of American financiers and industrialists in the parallel example of bu ilding the military power of the Soviet Union from 1917 onwards. Yet th ese American capitali sts were willing to finance and subsidize the Soviet Union whil e the Vietnam war was underway, knowing that the Soviets were supplying the other side. The contribution made by Amer ican capitalism to German war preparat ions before 1940 can only be described as phenomenal. It wa s certainly crucial to German military capabilities. For instance, in 1934 Germa ny produced domestically only 300,000 tons of natural petroleum products and less than 800,000 tons of synthetic gasoline; the balance was imported. Yet, ten years later in World War II , after transfer of th e Standard Oil of New Jersey hydrogenation patents a nd technology to I. G. Farben (used to produce synthetic gasoline from coal), Germany produced about 6 1/2 million tons of oil — of which 85 percent (5 1/2 million tons) wa s synthetic oil using the Sta ndard Oil hydrogena tion process. Moreover, the control of synthe tic oil output in Germany wa s held by the I. G. Farben subsidiary, Braunkohle-Benzin A. G., and this Farben cartel itself wa s created in 1926 with Wall Street financial assistance. On the other hand, the general impression left wi th the reader by modern historians is that this American technical assist ance was accidental and that American industrialists were innocent of wrongdoing. For example, the Kilgore Committee stated: The United States accidentally played an important role in the technical arming of Germany. Although the Germ an military planners had ordered and p ersuaded manu f acturin g corporations to install modern equipment f or mass"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"production, neither the military economists nor the corporations seem to have realized to the full extent what that me ant. Their eyes were opened when two of the chief American automobile companies built plants in Germany in order to sell in the European market, without the handicap of ocean freight charges and high German tariffs. Germans were brought to Detroit to learn the techniques of specialized production of components, and of straight-line assembly. What they saw caused further reorganization and refitting of other key German war plants. The techniques learned in Detroit were eventually used to construct the dive-bombing Stukas .... At a later period I. G. Farben representatives in this country enabled a stream of German e ngineers to visit not only plane plants but others of military importance, in which they learned a great deal that was eventually used agains t the United States. 2 Following these observations, which emphasize the \"accidental\" nature of the assistance, it has been concluded by such academic writers as Gabrie l Kolko, who is not usually a supporter of big business, that: It is almost superfluous to point out that the moti ves of the American firms bound to contracts with German concerns Were not pro. Nazi , whatever else they may have been. 3 Yet, Kolko to the contrary, an alyses of the contemporary Am erican business press confirm that business journals and news papers were fully aware of th e Nazi threat and its nature, while warning their business r eaders of German war preparat ions. And even Kolko admits that: The business press [in the United St ates] was aware, from 1935 on, that German prosperity was based on war pr eparations. More important, it was conscious of the fact t hat German industry was under the control of the Nazis and was being directed to serve Ge rmany's rearmament, and the firm mentioned most frequently in this context was the giant chemical empire, I. G. Farben. 4 Further, the evidence presented below suggests that not only was an in fluential sector of American business aware of the nature of Na ziism, but for its own purposes aided Naziism wherever possible (and profitable) — with full knowledge that the probable outcome would be war involving Europe and the United States. As we shall see, the pleas of innocence do not accord with the facts. 1924: The Dawes Plan The Treaty of Versailles afte r World War I imposed a heavy reparations burden on defeated Germany. This financial burden — a real caus e of the German discontent that led to acceptance of Hitlerism — was ut ilized by the international ba nkers for their own benefit. The opportunity to float profitable loans for German cartels in the United States was presented by the Dawes Plan and later the Young Plan. Both plans were engineered by these central bankers, who manned the committees for their own pecuniary advantages, and although technically the committe es were not appointed by the U.S. Government, the plans were in fact a pp roved and s p onsored b y the Government."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Post-war haggling by financiers and politicians fixed German repa rations at an annual fee of 132 billion gold marks. This wa s about one quarter of Germ any's total 1921 exports. When Germany was unable to make these crushing payments, France and Be lgium occupied the Ruhr to take by force what could not be obtained vol untarily. In 1924 the Allies appointed a committee of bankers (headed by American banker Charles G. Dawes) to develop a program of reparations paymen ts. The resulting Dawes Plan was, according to Georgetown University Professor of International Relati ons Carroll Quigley, \"lar gely a J.P. Morgan production.\" 5 The Dawes Plan arranged a series of foreign loans totaling $800 million with their proceeds flowing to Germ any. These loans are important for our story because the proceeds, raised for the greater part in the Unit ed States from dollar i nvestors, were utilized in the mid-1920s to create and consolidate the gigantic chemi cal and steel combinations of I. G. Farben and Vereinigte Stahlwerke, respect ively. These cartels not only helped Hitler to power in 1933; they also produced the bulk of key German war materials used in World War II. Between 1924 and 1931, under the Dawes Plan and the Young Pl an, Germany paid out to the Allies about 86 billion marks in repara tions. At the same t ime Germany borrowed abroad, mainly in the U.S., about 138 billi on marks — thus making a net German payment of only three billion marks for reparations. C onsequently, the burden of German monetary reparations to the Allies was actually carried by foreign subscribers to German bonds issued by Wall Street financial houses — at significant profits for themselves, of c ourse. And, let it be noted, these firms were owned by the same financiers who peri odically took off their banker hats and donned new ones to become \"sta tesmen.\" As \"statesmen\" they formulated the Dawes and Young Plans to \"solve\" the \"p roblem\" of reparations. As bankers, they floated the loans. As Ca rroll Quigley points out, It is worthy of note that this system was set up by the inter. national bankers and that the subsequent lending of othe r people's money to Germany was very profitable to these bankers. 6 Who were the New York international bankers who formed these reparations commissions? The 1924 Dawes Plan experts from the United States were banker Charles Dawes and Morgan representative Owen Young, who was pr esident of the General Electric Company. Dawes was chairman of the Allied Commi ttee of Experts in 1924. In 1929 Owen Young became chairman of the Committee of Expert s, supported by J.P. Morgan himself, with alternates T. W. Lamont, a Morgan partner, and T. N. Perkins, a banker with Morgan associations. In other words, the U.S. delegations were purely and simply, as Quigley has pointed out, J. P. Morgan delegations using the authority and seal of the United States to promote financial plans for thei r own pecuniary advantage. As a result, as Quigley puts it, the \"international bankers sat in heave n, under a rain of fees and commissions.\" 7 The German members of the Committee of E xperts were equally interesting. In 1924 Hjalmar Schacht was president of the Reic hsbank and had taken a prominent role in organization work for the Dawes Plan; so did German banker Carl Melchior. One of the 1928 German delegates was A. Voegler of the Ge rman steel cartel Stahlwerke Vereinigte. In brief, the two significant countries i nvolved — the United Stat es and Germany —were represented by the Morgan bankers on one side and Schacht and Voegler on the other, both of whom were key characters in the rise of Hitler's Germany and subsequent German rearmament."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Finally, the members and advi sors of the Dawes and Y oung Commissions were not only associated with New York financial houses but, as we shall later see, we re directors of firms within the German cartels which aided Hitler to power. 1928: The Young Plan According to Hitler's financ ial genie, Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht, and Nazi industrialist Fritz Thyssen, it was the 1928 Young Plan (the successor to the Dawes Plan), formulated by Morgan agent Owen D. Young, that brought Hitler to power in 1933. Fritz Thyssen claims that, I turned to the National Socialist Party only after I became convinced that the fight against the Young Plan was unavoidabl e if complete collapse of Germany was to be prevented. 8 The difference between the You ng Plan and the Dawes Plan wa s that, while the Young Plan required payments in goods produced in Germ any financed by foreign loans, the Young Plan required monetary payments and \"In my judgment [wrote Thyssen] the financial debt thus created was bound to disrupt the entire economy of the Reich.\" The Young Plan was assertedly a device to occupy Germany with Am erican capital and pledge German real assets for a gigantic mortga ge held in the United States. It is noteworthy that German firms with U.S. affiliations evad ed the Plan by the device of temporary foreign ownership. For instance, A.E.G. (German General Electric), affiliated with General Electric in the U.S., was sold to a Fr anco-Belgian holding company and evaded the conditions of the Young Plan. It should be noted in passing that Owen Young was the major financial backer for Franklin D. Roosevelt in the United European venture when FDR, as a budding Wall Street financier, endeavour ed to take advantage of Germany's 1925 hyperinflation. The United European venture was a vehicle to sp eculate and to profit upon the imposition of the Dawes Plan, and is clear eviden ce of private financiers (inc luding Franklin D. Roosevelt) using the power of the state to advance thei r own interests by manipul ating foreign policy. Schacht's parallel charge that Owen Young wa s responsible for the ri se of Hitler, while obviously self-serving, is recorded in a U.S. Government Intelligen ce report relating the interrogation of Dr. Fritz T hyssen in September, 1945: The acceptance of the Young Plan and it s financial principles increased unemployment more and more, until about one million were unemployed. People were desperate. Hitler said he would do away with unemployment. The government in power at t hat time was very bad, and the situation of the people was getting worse. That really was the reason of the enormous success Hitler had in the election. When the last election came, he got about 40%. 9 However, it was Schacht, not Owen Young, w ho conceived the idea which later became the Bank for International Settlements. The actual details were worked out at a conference presided over by Jackson Reynolds , \"one of the leading New Yo rk bankers,\" together with Melvin Traylor of the First National Bank of Chicago, Sir Charles Addis, formerly of the Hon g Kon g and Shan g hai Bankin g Cor p oration, and various Fren ch and German bankers. 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The B.I.S. was essential under th e Young Plan as a means to af ford a ready instrument for promoting international financia l relations. According to his own statements, Schacht also gave Owen Young the idea that later became the post-World War II International Bank for Reconstruction and Development: \"A bank of this kind will demand financia l co-operation be, tween vanquished and victors that will lead to community of interests whic h in turn will give rise to mutual confidence and understandi ng and thus promote and ensure peace.\" I can still vividly recall the setting in wh ich this conversation took place. Owen Young was seated in his armchair puffi ng away at his pipe, his legs outstretched, his keen eye s fixed unswervingly on me . As is my habit when propounding such arguments I was doing a quiet ste ady \"quarter-deck\" up and down the room. When I had finished ther e was a brief pause. Then his whole face lighted up and his resolve found utterance in the words: \"Dr. Schacht, you gave me a wonderful idea and I am going to sell it to the world. 11 B.I.S. — The Apex of Control This interplay of ideas and cooperation betw een Hjalmar Sehacht in Germany and, through Owen Young, the J.P. Morgan interests in Ne w York, was only one fa cet of a vast and ambitious system of cooperation and internationa l alliance for world co ntrol. As described by Carroll Quigley, this system was \"... nothing less than to create a world system of financial control, in private ha nds, able to dominate the politica l system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. 12 This feudal system worked in the 1920s, as it works today, thr ough the medium of the private central bankers in each country who control the national money supply of individual economies. In the 1920s and 1930s, the New Yo rk Federal Reserve System, the Bank of England, the Reichs-bank in Germany, and the Banque de France also more or less influenced the political apparatus of their respective count ries indirectly through control of the money supply and creation of the monetary environment. More direct influence was realized by supplying political funds to, or withdrawing support fro m, politicians and political parties. In the Unit ed States, for example, Presid ent Herbert Hoover blamed his 1932 defeat on withdrawal of support by Wall Street and the switch of Wall Street finance and influence to Franklin D. Roosevelt. Politicians amenable to the objectives of fina ncial capitalism, and academies prolific with ideas for world control useful to the internationa l bankers, are kept in line with a system of rewards and penalties. In the early 1930s the guiding vehicle for this international system of financial and political control, called by Quigley the \"apex of the system,\" was the Bank for International Settlements in Ba sle, Switzerland. The B.I.S. apex continued its work during World War II as the medium through which the bankers — who apparently were not at war with each other — continued a mutually beneficial exchange of ideas, information, and planning for the post-war world. As one writer has observed, war made no difference to the international bankers:"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The fact that the Bank possessed a trul y international staff did, of course, present a highly anomalous situation in time of war. An American President was transacting the daily business of the Bank through a French General Manager, who had a German A ssistant General Manager, while the Secretary- General was an Italian subject. Other nationals occupied other posts. These men were, of course, in daily personal co ntact with each other. Except for Mr. McKittrick [see infra] theft were of course situated permanently in Switzerland during this period and were not supposed to be subject to orders of their government at any time. Ho wever, the directors of the Bank remained, of course, in their respective countries and had no direct contact with the personnel of the Bank. It is alleged, howev er, that H. Schacht , president of the Reichsbank, kept a personal representati ve in Basle during most of this time. 13 It was such secret meetings, \"... meetings more secret than any ever held by Royal Ark Masons or by any Rosicrucian Order...\" 14 between the central bank ers at the \"apex\" of control that so intrigued c ontemporary journalists, although they only rarely and briefly penetrated behind th e mask of secrecy. Building the German Cartels A practical example of international finance operating behind the scenes to build and manipulate politico-economic sy stems is found in the German cartel system. The three largest loans handled by the Wall Street intern ational bankers for Germ an borrowers in the 1920s under the Dawes Plan were for the benefit of three German carte ls which a few years later aided Hitler and the Nazis to power. American financiers were directly represented on the boards of two of these th ree German cartels. This Amer ican assistance to German cartels has been described by James Martin as follows: \"These loan s for reconstruction became a vehicle for arrangements that did more to promote Worl d War II than to establish peace after World War I. 15 The three dominant cartels, the amounts borrowed and the Wa ll Street floating syndicate were as follows: German Cartel Wall Street Syndicate Amount Issued Allgemeine Elektrizitats- Gesellschaft (A.E.G.) (German General Electric) National City Co. $35,000,000 Vereinigte Stahlwerke (United Steelworks) Dillon, Read & Co. $70,225,000 American I.G. Chemical (I.G. Farben) National City Co. $30,000,000"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Looking at all the loans issue d, it appears that only a handful of New York financial houses handled the German reparati ons financing. Three houses — Dillon, Read Co.; Harris, Forbes & Co.; and National Ci ty Company — issued almost th ree-quarters of the total face amount of the loans and reaped most of the profits: Source: See Appendix A *Robert R. Kuczynski, Bankers Profits from German Loans (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 1932), p. 127. After the mid-1920s the two ma jor German combines of I.G. Farben and Vereinigte Stahlwerke dominated the chemi cal and steel cartel system cr eated by these loans. Although these firms. had a voting majority in the cart els for only two or thr ee basic products, they were able — through control of these basics — to enforce th eir will throughout the cartel. I.G. Farben was the main producer of basi c chemicals used by ot her combines making chemicals, so its economic power position ca nnot be measured only by its capacity to produce a few basic chemicals. Similarly, Vereinigte Stahlwer ke, with a pig-iron capacity greater than that of all other German ir on and steel producers co mbined, was able to exercise far more influence in the semi-fini shed iron and steel products cartel than its capacity for pig-iron production suggests. Even so the percentage output of these cartels for all products was significant: Wall Street Syndicate Manager Participation in German industrial issues in U.S. capital market Profits on German loans* Percent of total Dillon, Read & Co. $241,325,000 $2.7 million 29.2 Harris, Forbes & Co. 186,500,000 1.4 million 22.6 National City Co. 173,000,000 5.0 million 20.9 Speyer & Co. 59,500,000 0.6 million 7.2 Lee, Higginson & Co. 53,000,000 n.a 6.4 Guaranty Co. of N.Y. 41,575,000 0.2 million 5.0 Kuhn, Loeb & Co. 37,500,000 0.2 million 4.5 Equitable Trust Co. 34,000,000 0.3 million 4.1 ___________ ___________ _________ TOTAL $826,400,000 $10.4 million 99.9 Vereinigte Stahlwerke products Percent of German total production in 1938 Pig iron 50.8 Pipes and tubes 45.5 Heavy plate 36.0"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":" Among the products that brought I.G. Farben and Vereinigte Stahlwerke into mutual collaboration were coal tar and chemical nitrogen, both of prime importance for the manufacture of explosives. I. G. Farben had a cartel position that assured dominance in the manufacture and sale of chemical nitrogen, but had only about one percent of the cok-ing capacity of Germany. Hence an agreement was made under which Farben explosives subsidiaries obtained their benzol, toluol, and other primary coal-tar products on terms dictated by Vereinigte Stahlwer ke, while Vereinigte Stahlwerke 's explosives subsidiary was dependent for its nitrates on terms set by Farbe n. Under this system of mutual collaboration and inter-dependence, the two ca rtels, I.G. Farben and Vere inigte Stahlwerke, produced 95 percent of German .explosives in 1957-8 on the eve of World War II. This production was from capacity built by American loans and to some extent by American technology. The I. G. Farben-Standard Oil cooperation for production of synthetic oil from coal gave the I. G. Farben cartel a monopol y of German gasoline producti on during World War II. Just under one half of German high octane gasolin e in 1945 was produced directly by I. G. Farben and most of the balance by its affiliated companies. In brief, in synthetic gasoline and explosives (two of the very basi c elements of modern warfare), the control of German World War II output was in the hands of two German combines created by Wall Street loans under the Dawes Plan. Moreover, American assistance to Nazi war efforts extended into other areas. 17 The two largest tank producers in Hitler's Germany we re Opel, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors (controlled by the J.P. Morgan firm), and the Fo rd A. G. subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company of Detroit. The Nazis gran ted tax-exempt status to Opel in 1936, to enable General Motors to expand its production facilities. General Motors obligingly reinvested the resulting prof its into German industry. Henr y Ford was decorated by the Nazis for his services to Naziism. (See p. 93.)

In brief, American companies associated with the Morgan-Rockefeller international investment bankers — not, it should be noted, the vast bul k of independent American industrialists — were intimately related to the growth of Nazi industr y.

On the eve of World War II the German chemi cal complex of I.G. Farben was the largest chemical manufacturing enterprise in the world, with extraord inary political and economic power and influence within the Hi tlerian Nazi state. I. G. ha s been aptly described as \"a state within a state.\" The Farben cartel dated fro m 1925, when organizing genius Hermann Schm itz (with Wall Street financial assistance) created the super- giant chemical enterprise out of six already giant German chemical compan ies — Badische Anil in, Bayer, Agfa, Hoechst, Weiler-ter- Meer, and Griesheim-El ektron. These companies were merg ed to become Inter-nationale Gesellschaft Farbenindustrie A.G. — or I.G. Fa rben for short. Twenty years later the same Hermann Schmitz was put on trial at Nurem burg for war crimes committed by the I. G. cartel. Other I. G. Farben direct ors were placed on trial but the American affiliates of I. G. Farben and the American directors of I. G. itse lf were quietly forgotte n; the truth was buried in the archives. It is these U.S. connections in Wall Street that c oncern us. Without the capital supplied by Wall Street, there would have b een no I. G. Farben in the firs t place and almost certainly no Adolf Hitler and World War II. German bankers on the Farben Aufsichsrat (the supervisory Board of Directors) 1 in the late 1920s included the Hamburg banker Max War- burg, whose brother Paul Warburg was a founder of the Federal Reserve System in the United States. Not coincidentally, Paul Warburg was also on the board of American I. G., Farben's wholly ow ned U.S. subsidiary. In addition to Max Warburg a nd Hermann Schmitz, the guiding hand in the creation of the Farben empire, the early Farben Vorstand included Carl Bosch, Fritz ter Meer, Kurt Oppenheim and Geor ge von Schnitzler. 2 All except Max Warburg we re charged as \"war criminals\" after World War II. In 1928 the American holdings of I. G. Farben (i.e., the Bayer Company, General Aniline Works, Agfa Ansco, and Winthrop Chemical Company) were organized into a Swiss holding company, i. G. Chemic (Inter-n ationale Gesellschaft fur Chemisehe Unternehmungen A. G.), controlled by I. G. Fa rben in Germany. In th e following year these American firms merged to be come American I. G. Chemi cal Corporation, later renamed General Aniline & Film. Hermann Schmitz, the organizer of I. G.

G. Farben is of peculiar interest in th e formation of the Nazi state because Farben directors materially helped. Hitler and the Nazis to power in 1933. We have photographic evidence (see page 60) that I.G. Farben cont ributed 400,000 RM to Hitler 's political \"slush fund.\" It was this secret fund which financed the Nazi seiz ure of control in March 1933. Many years earlier Farben had obtained Wall Street funds for the 1925 cartelization and expansion in Germany and $30 million for Amer ican I. G. in 1929, and had Wall Street directors on the Farben board. It has to be noted that these funds were raised and directors appointed years before Hitler was promoted as the German dictator. The Economic Power of I. G. Farben Qualified observers have argue d that Germany could not have gone to war in 1939 without I. G. Farben. Between 1927 and the beginning of World War II, I.G. Farben doubled in size, an expansion made possible in great part by American technical assistance and by American bond issues, such as the one for $30 million offered by Nati onal City Bank. By 1939 I. G. acquired a participation and managerial influe nce in some 380 other German firms and over 500 foreign firms. The Farben empire owned it s own coal mines, its own electric power plants, iron and steel uni ts, banks, research units, and nume rous commercial enterprises. There were over 2,000 cartel agreements betw een I. G. and foreign firms — including Standard Oil of New Jersey, DuPont, Alcoa, Dow Chemical, and others in the United States, The full story of I,G, Farben and its world-wide ae-tivities before World War II can never be known, as key German records were de stroyed in 1945 in an ticipation of Allied victory. However, one post-war investigation by the U.S, War Department concluded that: Without I. G.'s immense pr oductive facilities, its in tense re. search, and vast international affiliations , Germany's prosecution of the war would have been unthinkable and impossible; Farben not only directed its energies toward arming Germany, but concentrated on we akening her intended victims, and this double-barreled attempt to expand the Ge rman industrial potential for war and to restrict that of the rest of the world was not conceived and executed \"in the normal course of business.\" The proof is overwhelming that I. G. Farben officials had full prior kn owledge of Germany's plan for world conquest and of each specific aggressive act later undertaken .... 3 Directors of Farben firms (i.e., the \"I. G. Farben officials\" refe rred to in the investigation) included not only Germans but al so prominent American fina nciers. This 1945 U.S. War Department report conclude d that I.G.'s assignment from Hitl er in the prewar period was to make Germany self-sufficient in rubber, gasoline, lubricat ing oils, magnesium, fibers, tanning agents, fats, and explosives . To fulfill this critical assignment, vast sums were spent by I.G. on processes to extract these war mate rials from indigenous German raw materials - in particular the plentiful Ge rman coal resources. Where these processes could not be developed in Germany ,they were acquired from abroad under cartel arrangements. For example, the process for iso- octane, essential for aviation fuels, was obtained from the United States, ... in fact entirely [from] the Americans and has become known to us in detail in its separate stages thr ough our agreements with them [Standard Oil of New Jersey] and is being used very extensively by us. 4 "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The process for manufacturing te tra-ethyl lead? essential for aviation gasoline, was obtained by I. G. Farben from the United States, and in 1939 I.G. was sold $20 million of high-grade aviation gasoline by Standard Oil of New Je rsey. Even before Germ any manufactured tetra- ethyl lead by the American pr ocess it was able to \"bor row\" 500 tons from the Ethyl Corporation. This loan of vita l tetra-ethyl lead was not repaid and I.G. forfeited the $1 million security. Further, I.G. purchased larg e stocks of magnesium from Dow Chemical for incendiary bombs and stockpiled explosives, stabilizers, phosphor us, and cyanides from the outside world. In 1939, out of 43 major products manufactured by I.G., 28 were of \"p rimary concern\" to the German armed forces. Farben's ultimate control of the German war economy, acquired during the 1920s and 1930s with Wa ll Street assistance, can be st be assessed by examining the percentage of German war material output produced by Farben plants in 1945. Farben at that time produced 100 percent of German s ynthetic rubber, 95 per cent of German poison gas (including all the Zyklon B gas used in th e concentration camps), 90 percent of German plastics, 88 percent of German magnesium, 84 percent of Germ an explosives, 70 percent of German gunpowder, 46 percent of German high oc tane (aviation) gasoline, and 33 percent of German synthetic gasoline. 5 (See Chart 2-1 and Table 2-1.)

Ther e were numerous Farben arrangements with American firms, including cartel marketing arra ngements, patent agreements, and technical exchanges as exemplified in the Standard Oil-Ethyl technology transfers mentioned above. These arrangements were used by I.G. to adva nce Nazi policy abroad, to collect strategic information, and to consolidate a world-wide ch emical cartel. One of the more horrifying aspects of I.G. Farben's cartel was the invention, production, and distribution of the Zyklon B gas, used in Nazi concentration camps. Zyklon B was pure Prussic acid, a lethal poison produc ed by I.G. Farben Leverkus en and sold from the Bayer sales office through Degesch, an independent license holder. Sales of Zyklon B amounted to almost three-quarters of De gesch business; enough gas to kill 200 million humans was produced and sold by I.G. Farben. The Kilgor e Committee report of 1942 makes it clear that the I.G. Farben directors had precise knowledge of the Nazi concentration camps and the use of I.G. chemicals. This prior knowledge becomes significant when we later consider the role of the American directors in I.G.'s Am erican subsidiary. The 1945 interrogation of I.G. Farben director yon Schnitzler reads: Q. What did you do when they to ld you that I.G. chemicals was [sic] being used to kill, to murder peopl e held in concentration camps? A. I was horrified. Q. Did you do anything about it? A. I kept it for me [to myself] becaus e it was too terrible .... I asked Muller- Cunradi is it known to you and Ambros an d other directors in Auschwitz that the gases and chemicals are being used to murder people. Q. What did he say? A. Yes: it is known to all I.G. directors in Auschwitz. 7 There was no attempt by I.G. Farben to halt production of the gases — a rather ineffective way for von Schnitzler to express any concern for human life, \"because it was too terrible.\" The Berlin N.W. 7 office of I. G. Farben was the key Nazi overseas espionage center. The unit operated under Farben direct or Max Ilgner, nephew of I.G. Farben president Hermann Schmitz. Max Ilgner and Hermann Schmitz were on the board of Am erican I.G., with fellow directors Henry Ford of Ford Motor Company, Paul Warburg of Bank of Manhattan, and Charles E. Mitchell of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

One of the more prominent of these Farben intelligence workers in N.W. 7 was Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, who joined Farben in the early 1930s after completion of an 18-month period of service in the black-uniformed S.S. 8 The U.S. arm of the VOWI intelligence networ k was Chemnyco, Inc. According to the War Department, Utilizing normal business c ontacts Chemnyco was able to transmit to Germany tremendous amounts of material rangi ng from photographs and blueprints to detailed descriptions of whole industrial plants. 9 Chemnyco's vice president in New York wa s Rudolph Ilgner, an American citizen and brother of American I, G. Farb en director Max Ilgner. In br ief, Farben operated VOWI, the Nazi foreign intelligence operation, before World War II and th e VOWI operation was associated with prominent members of the Wall Street Establishm ent through American I.G. and Chemnyco. The U.S. War Department also accused I.G. Farben and its American associates of spearheading Nazi psychologi cal and economic warfare progr ams through dissemination of propaganda via Farben agents abroad, and of providing foreign exchange for this Nazi propaganda. Farben's cartel arrangements promoted Nazi economic warfare — the outstanding example being the voluntary Standard Oil of Ne w Jersey restriction on development of synthetic rubber in the United Stat es at the behest of I. G. Farben. As the War Department report puts it: The story in short is that because of Standard Oil's determi nation to maintain an absolute monopoly of synthetic rubber de velopments in the United States, it fully accomplished I.G.'s purpose of preventing United States production by dissuading American rubber companies from undertaking independent research in developing synthetic rubber processes. 10 In 1945 Dr. Oskar Loehr, deputy head of the I.G. \"Tea Buro,\" confirmed that I. G. Farben and Standard Oil of New Jersey operated a \"preconceived plan \" to suppress development of the synthetic rubber industry in the United States, to th e advantage of the German Wehrmacht and to the disadvantage of the United States in World War II. Dr. Loehr's testimony reads (in part) as follows: Q. Is it true that while the delay in divulging the buna [synthetic rubber] processes to American rubber comp anies was taking place, Chemnyco and Jasco were in the meantime keeping I.G. well informed in regard to synthetic rubber development in the U.S.? A. Yes. Q. So that at all times I.G. was fully aware of the state of the development of the American syntheti c rubber industry? A. Yes."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Q.

A. Mr. Ringer reported it. Q. Was it at that meeti ng that for the first time Mr. Howard told I.G. the American rubber companies might have to be informed of th e processes and he assured I.G. that Standard Oil would c ontrol the synthetic rubber industry in the U.S.? Is that right? A. That is right. That is the knowledge I got th rough Mr. Ringer. Q. So that in all these arrangements si nce the beginning of the development of the synthetic rubber industr y the suppression of the s ynthetic rubber industry in the U.S. was part of a preconceived pl an between I.G. on the one hand and Mr. Howard of Standard Oil on the other? A. That is a conclusion that must be drawn from the previous facts. 11 I.G. Farben was pre-war Germany's largest ea rner of foreign excha nge, and this foreign exchange enabled Germany to purchase strategi c raw materials, mili tary equipment, and technical processes, and to finance its overseas programs of espionage, propaganda, and varied military and political activities preceding World War II. Acti ng on behalf of the Nazi state, Farben broadened its ow n horizon to a world scale whic h maintained close relations with the Nazi regime and the Wehrmaeht. A liaison office, the Vermittlungsstelle W, was established to maintain communi cations between I.G. Farben and the German Ministry of War: The aim of this work is the building up o.[ a tight organ izatton for armament in the I.G. which could be inserted without difficulty in the existing organization of the I.G. and the individual pl ants. In the case of war, I.G. will be treated by the authorities concerned with armament questions as one big plant which, in its task for the armament, as far as it is possible to do so from the technical point of view, will re gulate itself without any organizational influence from outside (the work in th is direction was in principle agreed upon with the Ministr y o f War Wehrwirtschaftsant ) and f rom this o ff ice with the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Ministry of Economy. To the field of the work of the Vermittlungsstelle W belongs, besides the organizational set-up and long-range planning, the continuous collaboration with regard to the armament and technical questions with the authorities of the Reich and with the plants of the I.G. 12 Unfortunately the files of the Vermittlungsstelle offices were destroyed prior to the end of the war, although it is known from other s ources that from 1934 onwards a complex network of transactions evol ved between I.G. and the Wehr macht. In 1934 I. G. Farben began to mobilize for war, and each I.G. plant prep ared its war production plans and submitted the plans to the Ministries of War and Economics. By 1935-6 war games were being held at I.G. Farben plants and wart ime technical procedures rehearsed. 13 These war games were described by Dr. Struss, head of th e Secretariat of I.G.'s Technical Committee: It is true that sinc e 1934 or 1935, soon after th e establishment of the Vermittlungsstelle W in the different works, th eoretical war plant games had been arranged to examine how the effect of bombing on certain factories would materialize. It was particularly taken in to consideration what would happen if 100- or 500-kilogram bombs would fall on a certain factory and what would be the result of it. It is also right that the word Kriegsspiele was used for it. The Kriegsspiele were prepared by Mr. Ritter and Dr. Eckell, later on partly by Dr. yon Brunning by personal order on Dr. Krauch's own initiative or by order of the Air Force, it is not known to me. The tasks were partly given by the Vermittlung-sstelle W and partly by officers of th e Air Force. A number of officers of all groups of the Wehr macht (Navy, Air Force, and Army) participated in these Kriegsspiele. The places which were hit by bombs were marked in a map of the plant so that it could be ascertained which parts of the plant were damaged, for example a gas meter or an important pipe line. As soon as the raid finished, the management of the plant ascertained the damages and reported which part of the plant had to stop working; they fu rther reported what time would be required in order to repair the dam ages. In a following meeting the consequences of the Kriegsspiele were described and it was ascertained that in the case of Leuna [plant] the damages involved were considerably high; especially it was found out that alterations of the pipe lines were to be made at considerable cost. 14 Consequently, throughout the 1930s I. G. Farben did more than just comply with orders from the Nazi regime. Farben was an initia tor and operator for the Nazi plans for world conquest. Farben acted as a re search and intelligence orga nization for the German Army and voluntarily initiated Wehrmac ht projects. In fact the Army only rarely had to approach Farben; it is estimated that about 40 to 50 pe rcent of Farben projects for the Army were initiated by Farben itself. In brief, in the words of Dr, von Schnitzler: Thus, in acting as it had done, I.G. contracted a great responsibility and constituted a substantial aid in the chemical domain and decisive help to Hitler's foreign policy, which led to war and to the ruin of Germany. Thus, I must conclude that I.G. is lar g el y responsible f or Hitler's polic y ,"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" Polishing I. G. Farben's Public Image This miserable picture of pre- war military preparation was know n abroad and had to be sold — or disguised — to the American public in or der to facilitate Wall Street fund-raising and technical assistance on behalf of I. G. Farben in the United States. A prominent New York public relations firm was chosen for the job of selling the I.G. Farben combine to America. The most notable public relati ons firm in the late 1920s a nd 1930s was Ivy Lee & T.J. Ross of New York. Ivy Lee had previously undert aken a public relations campaign for the Rockefellers, to spruce up the Rockefeller na me among the American public. The firm had also produced a syncophantic book entitled USSR, undertaking the same clean-up task for the Soviet Union — even while Soviet labor camps were in fu ll blast in the late 20s and early 30s. From 1929 onwards Ivy Lee became public relations counsel for I. G. Fa rben in the United States. In 1934 Ivy Lee presented testimony to the House Un-American Activities Committee on this work for Farben. 15 Lee testified that I.G. Fa rben was affiliated with the American Farben firm and \"The American I. G. is a holding company with directors such people as Edsel Ford, Walter Teagle, one of the officers of the City Bank .... \" Lee explained that he was paid $25,000 per year under a contract made with Max Ilgner of I.G. Farben. His job was to counter criticism levelle d at I.G. Farben within the United States. The advice given by Ivy Lee to Farben on this problem was acceptable enough: In the first place, I have told them t hat they could never in the world get the American people reconciled to their treatm ent of the Jews: t hat that was just foreign to the American mentality and coul d never be justifie d in the American public opinion, and there was no use trying. In the second place, anything that sa vored of Nazi propaganda in this country was a mistake and ought not to be unde r. taken. Our people regard it as meddling with American affa irs, and it was bad business. 16 The initial payment of $4,500 to Ivy Lee unde r this contract was made by Hermann Schmitz, chairman of I.G. Fa rben in Germany. It was depos ited in the New York Trust Company under the name of I. G. Chemic (or the \"Swiss I.G.,\" as Ivy Lee termed it). However, the second and major payment of $14,450 was made by William von Rath of the American I.G. and also deposited by Ivy Lee in New York Trust Company, for the credit of his personal account. (The firm account was at the Chase Bank.) This poi nt about the origin of the funds is 'important when we consider the identity of direct ors of American I.G., because payment by American I. G. meant that the bulk of th e Nazi propaganda funds were not of German origin. They were American funds earned in the U.S. and under control of American directors, although used for Nazi propaganda in the United States. In other words, most of the Nazi pr opaganda funds handled by Ivy Lee were not imported from Germany. The use to which these American funds were put was brought out under questioning by the House Un-American Activities Committee: Mr. DICKSTEIN. As I understand y ou, y ou testified that y ou received no"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"propaganda at all, and that you had not hing to do with the distribution of propaganda in this country?

Have you r eceived or has your firm received any propaganda literature from Germany at any time? Mr. LEE. Yes, sir. Mr. DICKSTEIN. And when was that? Mr. LEE. Oh, we have received — it is a question of what you call propaganda. We have received an imme nse amount of literature. Mr. DICKSTEIN. You do not know what that literature was and what it contained?

A great ma ny of them, of course, were in German, a nd I had what my son sent me. He said they were interesting and significant, and those I had translated or excerpts of them made. 17 Finally, Ivy Lee employed Bur nham Carter to study Americ an new paper reports on Germany and prepare suitable pro-Nazi replies.

In other words, you rece ive this material that deals with German conditions today: You examine it and you advise them. It has nothing to do with the German Government, alt hough the material, th e literature, is official literature of the Hitler regime. That is correct, is it not? Mr. LEE.

In other words, the material that was sent here by the I.G. was material spread — we w ould call it propaganda t by authority of the German Government. But the distin ction that you make in your statement is, as I take it, that the German Government did not se nd it to you directly; that it was sent to you by the I.G. Mr. LEE. Right. Mr. DICKSTEIN.

American I.G. Farben directors included so me of the more prominent members of Wall Street. German interests re-entered the United States after World War I, and successfully overcame barriers designed to keep I.G. out of the American market. Neither seizure of German patents, establishment of the Che mical Foundation, nor high tariff walls were a major problem. By 1925, General Dyestuff Corporation was esta blished as the exclusive selling agent for products manufactured by Gasselli Dyestuff (renamed Ge neral Aniline Works, Inc., in 1929) and imported from Germany. The stock of General Aniline Works was transferred in 1929 to American I.G. Chemical Corporation and later in 1939 to General Aniline & Film Corporation, into which American I.G. and Ge neral Aniline Works we re merged. American I.G. and its successor, General Aniline & Film, is the unit through which control of I.G.'s enterprises in the U.S. was maintained. The stock authorization of American I.G. was 3,000,000 common A shares and 3,000,000 common B shar es. In return for stock in terests in General Aniline Works and Agfa-Ansco Corporation, I.G.

This I.G. pr edominance increased during 1940 and 1941 as American directors, including Edsel Ford, rea lized the political unhealthiness of I.G. and resigned.

First, the board of American I.G. had three directors from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the most influential of the various Federal Reserve Banks. American I.G. also had inte rlocks with Standard Oil of New Jersey, Ford Motor Company, Bank of Manhattan (later to become the Chase Manhattan), and A.E.G. (German General Electr ic).

The General Electric Company electrif ied the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1930s, and fulfilled for the Soviets Lenin's dict um that \"Socialism = electrification.\" 1 The Swope Plan, created by General Electric's one-time pr esident Gerard Swope, became Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, by a process deplored by one-time Presiden t Herbert Hoover and described in Wall Street and FDR. 2 There was a long-lasting, intimate relationship between Swope and Young of General El ectric Company and the Roos evelt family, as there was between General Elect ric and the Soviet Union. In 1936 Senator James A. Reed of Missouri, an early Roosevelt supporter, became aware of Roosevelt's betrayal of liberal ideas and attacked the Roosev elt New Deal program as a \"t yrannical\" measure \"leading to despotism, [and] sought by its sponsors under the communistic cry of 'Social Justice.'\" Senator Reed further charged on the floor of th e Senate that Franklin D. Roosevelt was a \"hired man for the economic royali sts\" in Wall Street and that the Roosevelt family \"is one of the largest stockholders in the General Electric Company.\" 3 As we probe into behind-the-scenes German in terwar history and the story of Hitler and Naziism, we find both Owen D. Young and Gera rd Swope of General Electric tied to the rise of Hitlerism and the suppr ession of German democracy. That General Electric directors are to be found in each of these three distinct historical categories — i.e., the development of the Soviet Union, the crea tion of Roosevelt's New Deal, and the rise of Hitlerism — suggests how elements of Big Business are keenly interested in the socialization of the world, for their own purposes and objectives, rath er than the maintenance of the impartial market place in a free society. 4 General Electric profited handsomely from Bolshevism, from Roosevelt's New De al socialism, and, as we shall s ee below, from national socialism in Hitler's Germany. General Electric in Weimar Germany Walter Rathenau was, until his assassinati on in 1922, managing direct or of Allgemeine Elekrizitats Gesellschaft (A .E.G,), or German General El ectric, and like Owen Young and Gerard Swope, his counterparts in the U.S., he was a prominent a dvocate of corporate socialism.

Because both Rathanau a nd Swope wanted the protection and cooperation of the state for their own corporate objectives and prof it. (But not of cour se for anybody else's objectives and profits.) Rathan au expressed their plea in The New Political Economy: The new economy will, as we have see n, be no state or governmental economy but a private economy commit ted to a civic power of resolution which certainly will require state cooperation for organi c consolidation to overcome inner friction and increase production and endurance. 5 When we disentangle the turgid Rathenau prose, this means that the power of the State was to be made available to private fi rms for their own corporate purposes, i.e., what is popularly known as national soci alism. Rathenau spoke out publicly against competition and free enterprise. inheritance.\" 6 Not their own wealth, so far as can be determined, but the wealth of others who lacked politi cal pull in the State apparatus. Owen D. Young of General Electri c was one of the three U.S. delegates to the 1923 Dawes Plan meeting which establishe d the German reparations pr ogram. And in the Dawes and Young Plans we can see how some private firms were able to be nefit from the power of the State. The largest single loans from Wall Street to Germany during the 1920s were reparations loans; it was ultimately the U.S. investor who paid for German reparations. The cartelization of the German el ectrical industry under A.E.G. (as well as the steel and chemical industries discussed in Chapters One and Two) was made possible with these Wall Street loans: In 1928, at the Young Plan reparations meetings , we find General Elec tric president Owen D.

In 1930 Owen D. Young, after whom the Young Plan for German reparations was named, became chairman of the Board of General Electric Company in New York City. Young was also chairman of the Executive Committee of Radio Corporation of Am erica and a director of both German General El ectric (A.E.G.) and Osram in Germany. Young also served on the boards of other major U.S. corporations, including General Motors, NBC, and RKO; he was a councilor of th e National Industrial Conference Board, a director of the International Cham ber of Commerce, and deputy chairman of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Gerard Swope was president and director of General Electric Company as well as French and German associated companies, includi ng A.E.G. and Osram in Germany. Swope was also a director of RCA, NBC, and the Nationa l City Bank of New Yor k. Other directors of International General Electric at this time reflect Morgan c ontrol of the company, and both Young and Swope were generally known as the Morgan representatives on the G.E. board, which included Thomas Cochran, another partner in the J.P. Morgan firm. General Electric director Clark Haynes Minor wa s president of International General Electric in the 1920s. Another director was Vi ctor M. Cutter of the First Nati onal Bank of Boston and a figure in the \"Banana Revolutions\" in Central America. In the late 1920s Young, Swope, and Minor of In ternational General Electric moved into the German electrical industry and ga ined, if not control as some have reported, then at least a substantial say in the internal affairs of both A.E.G. a nd Osram. In July 1929 an agreement was reached between General Electric and three German firms — A.E.G., Siemens & Halske, and Koppel and Company — which betwee n them owned all the shares in Osram, the electric bulb manufacturer. General Electric purchased 16% percent of Os ram stock and reached a joint agreement fo r international control of electric bulbs production and marketing. Clark Minor and Gerard Swope became directors of Osram. 7 In July 1929 great interest was shown in rumors circulating in German financial circles that General Electric was also buyi ng into A.E.G. and that talks to this end were in progress between A.E.G. and G.E. 8 In August it was confirmed that 14 million marks of common A.E.G. stock were to be issued to General El ectric. These shares, a dded to shares bought on the open market, gave General Electric a 25-pe rcent interest in A.E.G. A closer working agreement was signed between the two companies, providing the German company U.S. technology and patents. It was emphasized in the news repor ts that A.E.G. would not have participation in G.E., but that on the other hand G.E. would fi nance expansion of A.E.G. in Germany. 9 The German financial pre ss also noted that there wa s no A.E.G. representation on the board of G.E. in the United States but that five Americans we re now on the board of A.E.G. The Vossische Zeitung recorded, The American electrical industry has conquered the worM, and only a few of the remaining opposing bastions have been able to withstand the onslaught... 10 By 1930, unknown to the German financial press, General Electric had similarly gained an effective technical monopoly of the Soviet elec trical industry and was soon to penetrate even the remaining bastions in Germany, pa rticularly the Siemen s group. In January 1930 three G.E. men were elected to the board of A.E.G. — Clark H. Minor, Gerard Swope, and E. H. Baldwin — and International General Elec tric (I.G.E.) continued its moves to merge the world electrical industr y into a g iant cartel under Wall Street control."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"In February General Electric focused on the remaining German electri cal giant, Siemens & Halske, and while able to obtain a large block of debentures issued on behalf of the German firm by Dillon, Read of New Yor k, G.E. was not able to gain participation or directors on the Siemens board. While the German press r ecognized even this limited control as\" an historical economic event of th e first order and an important step toward a future world electric trust,\" 11 Siemens retained its independence from General Electric — and this independence is important for our story. The New York Times reported, The entire press emphasizes the fact that Siemens, contrary to A.E.G., maintains its independence for the future and points out that no General Electric representative will sit on Stemen's board of directors. 12 There is no evidence that Siemens, either through Siemens & Halske or Siemens-Schukert, participated directly in the fi nancing of Hitler. Si emens contributed to Hitler only slightly and indirectly through a share participation in Osram. On the other hand, both A.E.G. and Osram directly financed Hitler through th e Nationale Treuhand in substantial ways. Siemens retained its independence in the ear ly 1930s while both A.E.G. and Osram were under American dominance and wi th American directors. There is no evidence that Siemens, without American directors, financed Hitler . On the other hand, we have irrefutable documentary evidence (see page 56) that both German General Electric and Osram, both with American directors, financed Hitler. In the months following the attempted Wall Str eet take over of Siemens, the pattern of a developing world trust in the el ectrical industry clarified; there was an end to international patent fights and the G.E. interest in A.E.G. increased to nearly 30 percent. 13 Consequently, in the early 1930s, as Hitler prepared to grab dictatorial power in Germany — backed by some, but by no means all, Ge rman and American industrialists — the German General Electric (A.E.G .) was owned by International General Electric (about 30 percent), the Gesellschaft fü r Electrische Unternemungen (25 percent), and Ludwig Lowe (25 percent).

General Electric and the Financing of Hitler The tap root of modern corporat e socialism runs deep into the management of two affiliated multi-national corporations: General Electric Co mpany in the United St ates and its foreign associates, including German Ge neral Electric (A.E.G.), and Osram in Germany. We have noted that Gerard Swope, second president a nd chairman of Genera l Electric, and Walter Rathanau of A.E.G. promoted radical ideas for control of the St ate by private business interests. From 1915 onwards International Gene ral Electric (I.G.E.), located at 120 Broadway in New York City, acted as the foreign investme nt, manufacturing, and se lling organization for the General Electric Company. I.G.E. held in terests in overseas manufacturing companies including a 25 to 30-percent holdi ng in German General Electric (A.E.G.), plus holdings in Osram G.m.b.H. Kommanditgesellschaft, also in Berlin. These holdings gave International General Electric four directors on the board of A.E.G., and another director at Osram, and si g nificant influence in the internal domestic p olicies of these German com p anies.

This slip is reproduced on page 56. I.G. Farben was the most important of the domestic financial backers of Hitler, and (as noted elsewhere) I.G. Farben controlled American I.G. Mo reover, several directors of A.E.G. were also on the board of I.G. Farben — i.e., Hermann Bucher, chairman of A.E.G. was on the I.G. Farben board; so were A.E.G. directors Julius Flechtheim and Walter von Rath. I.G. Farben contributed 30 percent of the 1933 Hitler National Trusteeship (or takeover) fund. Walter Fahrenhorst of A.E.G. was also on the board of P hoenix A-G, Thyssen A-G and Demag A-G — and all were c ontributors to Hitler's fu nd. Demag A-G contributed 50,000 RM to Hitler's fund and had a director with A.E.G.— the notorious Friedrich Flick, and early Hitler supporter, who was later convict ed at the Nuremberg Trials. Accumulatoren Fabrik A-G was a Hitler cont ributor (25,000 RM, see page 60) with two directors on the A.E.G. board, August Pfeffer an d Gunther Quandt. Quandt pe rsonally owned 75 percent of Accumulatoren Fabrik. Osram Gesellschaft, in which International Gene ral Electric had a 16 2/3r ds direct interest, also had two directors on the A.E.G. board : Paul Mamroth and He inrich Pferls. Osram contributed 40,000 RM directly to the Hitler fund. The Otto Wolff concern, Vereinigte Stahlwerke A-G, recipient of substantial New York loans in the 1920s, had three directors on the A.E.G. board: Otto Wolff, Henry Nath an and Jakob Goldschmidt. Alfred Krupp yon Bohlen, sole owner of the Krupp organization and an earl y supporter of Hitler, was a member of the Aufsichsrat of A.E.G. Robert Pferdmenges, a member of Himmler's Circle of Friends, was also a director of A, E.G. In other words, almost all of the German directors of German General Electric were financial supporters of Hitler and associated not only with A.E.G. bu t with other companies financing Hitler. Walter Rathenau 14 became a director of A,E.G. in 1899 and by the early twentieth century was a director of more than 100 corporations. Rathenau was al so author of the\" Rathenau Plan,\" which bears a remarkable resemblance to the \"Swope Plan\" — i.e., FDR's New Deal but written by Swope of G.E. In other words, we have the ext raordinay coincidence that the authors of New Deal-tike plans in the U.S. and Germany were also prime backers of their implementers: Hitler in Germany and Roosevelt in the U.S. Swope was chairman of the board of Genera l Electric Company and International General Electric.

G.E. and the four American directors were the largest singl e interest and consequently ha d the greatest single influence in A.E.G. actions and policies. Even further, almost all ot her directors of A.E.G. were connected with firms (I. G. Farben, Accumulatoren Fabrik, etc.) which contributed directly — as firms — to Hitler's polit ical fund. However, only the Germ an directors of A.E.G were placed on trial in Nuremburg in 1945. Technical Cooperat ion with Krupp Quite apart from financial assist ance to Hitler, General Electric extended its assistance to cartel schemes with other Hitler backers for their mutual benefi t and the benefit of the Nazi state. Cemented tungsten carb ide is one example of this G.E.-Nazi cooperation. Prior to November 1928, American indust ries had several sources fo r both tungsten carbide and tools and dies containing this hard-metal composition. Among these sources were the Krupp Company of Essen, Germany, and two American firms to which Krupp was then shipping and selling, the Union Wire Die Corporation and Thomas Prosser & Son. In 1928 Krupp obligated itself to grant lice nses under United States patent s which it owned to the Firth- Sterling Steel Company and to the Ludlum Steel Company. Before 1928, this tungsten carbide for use in tools and dies sold in the United states for about $50 a pound. The United States patents which Krupp cl aimed to own were assigned from Osram Kommanditgesellschaft, and had been prev iously assigned by the Osram Company of Germany to General Electric. However, Ge neral Electric had also developed its own patents, principally the Hoyt and Gilson patents, covering competing processes for cemented tungsten carbide. Gene ral Electric believed that it could utilize these patents independently without infringing on or competing with Krupp patents. But instead of using the G.E. patents independently in competiti on with Krupp, or testing out its rights under the patent laws, General Electric worked out a ca rtel agreement with Krupp to pool the patents of both parties and to give Ge neral Electric a m onopoly control of tungsten carbide in the United States. director of A.E.G. and Osram in Germany.

The 1920s price of around $50 a pound wa s raised by Carboloy to $458 a pound. Obviously, no firm could sell any great amounts of tungsten carbid e in this price range, but the price would maximize profits for G.E. In 1934 General Electric and Carboloy were also able to obtain, by purchase, the license granted by Krupp to the Ludlum Steel Company, thereby eliminating one competitor. In 1936, Krupp was induced to refrain from further imports into the United States. Part of the price paid for the elimination from the American market of tungsten carbide manufactured abroad was a reciprocal undertaking that General Electric and Carboloy would not export from the U.S. T hus these American companies tied their own hands by contract, or permit ted Krupp to tie their hands, a nd denied foreign markets to American industry. Carboloy Co mpany then acquired the busin ess of Thomas Prosser & Son, and in 1937, for nearly $1 million, Carboloy acquired the competing business of the Union Wire Die Corporation. By refusing to sell, Krupp coope rated with General Electric and Carboloy to persuade Union Wi re Die Corporation to sell out. Licenses to manufacture tungsten carbide were then refused. A request for license by the Crucible Steel Company was re fused in 1936. A request by the Chrysler Corporation for a license was refused in 1938. A license by the Triplett Electrical In strument Company was refused on April 25, 1940. A license was also re fused to the General Cable Company. The Ford Motor Company for severa l years expressed st rong opposition to the high-price policy followed by the Carboloy Company, and at on e point made a request for the right to manufacture for its own use. Th is was refused. As a result of these tactics, General Electric and its subsidiary Carboloy emerged in 1936 or 1937 with virtually a complete monopoly of tungsten carbide in the United States. In brief, General Electric — with the cooperation of anot her Hitler supporter, Krupp — jointly obtained for G,E. a monopoly in the U.S. for tungsten carbide. So when World War II began, General Electric had a monopoly at an establ ished price of $450 a pound — almost ten times more than the 1928 price — and use in th e U.S. had been correspondingly restricted, A.E.G.

The electrical equipment plants bombed as targ ets were not those affiliated with U.S. firms. It was Brown Boveri at Mannheim and Siemensstadt in Berlin — which were not connected with the U.S. — who were bom bed. As a result, German production of electrical war equipment rose steadily thr oughout World War II, peak ing as late as 1944. According to the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey reports, \"In the opinion of Speers' assistants and plant officials, the war ef fort in Germany was never hindered in any important manner by any shortage of electrical equipment.\" 15 One example of the non-bombing policy for German General Elect ric was the A. E.G. plant at 185 Muggenhofer Strasse, Nuremburg. Study of th is plant's output in World War II is of interest because it illustrates the extent to which purely peacetime production was converted to war work. The pre-war plant manufactured household equipment, su ch as hot plates, electric ranges, electric irons , toasters, industrial baking ove ns, radiators, water heaters, kitchen ovens, and industrial heaters. In 1939, 1940 and 1941, most of the Nuremburg plant's production facilities were used for the manufacture of peace time products. In 1942 the plant's production was shif ted to manufacture of war e quipment. Metal parts for communications equipment and munitions such as bombs and mines were made.

BACK "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" CHAPTER FOUR Standard Oil Fuels World War II In two gears Germany will be manuf acturing oil and gas enough out of soft coal for a long war. The Standard Oil of New York is furnishing millions of dollars to help. (Report from the Commercial Att aché, U.S. Embassy in Berlin, Germany, January 1933, to State Depa rtment in Washington, D.C,) The Standard Oil group of companies, in which the Rock efeller family owne d a one-quarter (and controlling) interest, 1 was of critical assi stance in helping Nazi Germany prepare for World War II. This assistance in military preparation ca me about because Germany's relatively insignificant supplie s of crude petroleum were qu ite insufficient for modern mechanized warfare; in 1934 for instance abou t 85 percent of German finished petroleum products were imported. Th e solution adopted by Nazi Germany was to manufacture synthetic gasoline from its plentiful domestic coal supplie s. It was the hydrogenation process of producing synthetic gasoline and iso- octane properties in gasoline that enabled Germany to go to war in 1940 — and this hydrogenation process was developed and financed by the Standard Oil la boratories in the United States in partnership with I.G. Farben. Evidence presented to the Tr uman, Bone, and Kilgore Com mittees after World War II confirmed that Standard Oil had at the same time \"seriously imperiled the war preparations of the United States.\" 2 Documentary evidence was pres ented to all three Congressional committees that before World War II Standard Oil had agreed with I.G. Farben, in the so- called Jasco agreement, that s ynthetic rubber was within Farben's sphere of influence, while Standard Oil was to have an absolute monopoly in the U.S. only if and when Farben allowed development of synthetic r ubber to take place in the U.S.: Accordingly [concluded the Kilgore Co mmittee] Standard fu lly accomplished I.G.'s purpose of preventing United States production by dissuading American rubber companies from undertaking independent research in developing synthetic rubber processes. 3 Regrettably, the Congressional comm ittees did not explore an ev en more ominous aspect of this Standard Oil — I.G. Farben collusion: that at this time directors of Standard Oil of New Jersey had not only strategic wa rfare affiliations to I.G. Fa rben, but had other links with Hitler's Germany — even to the extent of contributi ng, through German subsidiary companies, to Heinrich Himmler 's personal fund and with memb ership in Himmler's Circle of Friends as late as 1944. During World War II Standard Oi l of New Jersey was accused of treason for this pre-war alliance with Farben, even while its continui ng wartime activities within Himmler's Circle of Friends were unknown. The acc usations of treason were ve hemently denied by Standard Oil. One of the more p rominent of these defenses was p ublished b y R.T. Haslam, a director"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"of Standard Oil of New Jersey, in The Petroleum Times (December 25, 1943), and entitled \"Secrets Turned into Mighty War Weapons Through I.G. Farben Agreement.\" 4 This was an attempt to turn the tables and present the pre- war collusion as advantageous to the United States. Whatever may have been Standa rd Oil's wartime recollections and hasty defense, the 1929 negotiations and contr acts between Standard and I.G. Farben were recorded in the contemporary press and describe the agreements between Standard Oil of New Jersey and I.G. Farben and their intent. In April 1929 Walter C. Teagle, president of Standard Oil of New Jersey, became a director of the newly organized Americ an I.G. Farben. Not because Teagle was interested in the chemical industry but because, It has for some years past enjoyed a very close relationship with certain branches of the research work of the I. G. Farbenin-dustrie which bear closely upon the oil industry. 5 It was announced by Teagle that joint research work on production of oil from coal had been carried on for some time and that a re search laboratory for this work was to be established in the United States . 6 In November 1929 this jointl y owned Standard — Farben research company was established under the management of th e Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, and all research and patent s relating to production of o il from coal held by both I.G. and Standard were pooled. Previousl y, during the period 1926-1929, the two companies had cooperated in development of the hydrogena tion process, and expe rimental pl ants had been placed in operation in bo th the U.S. and Germany. It was now proposed to erect new plants in the U.S. at Bayway, New Jersey a nd Baytown, Texas, in addition to expansion of the earlier experimental plant at Baton Rouge. Standard announced: ... the importance of the new contract as applied to this country lay in the fact that it made certain that the hydr ogenation process would be developed commercially in this country under the guidance of American oil interests. 7 In December 1929 the new company, Standard I.G. Company, was organized. F.A. Howard was named president, and its German and Am erican directors were announced as follows: E.M. Clark, Walter Duisberg, Pe ter Hurll, R.A. Reidemann, H.G. Seidel, Otto von Schenck, and Guy Wellman. The majority of the stock in the research company was owned by Standard Oil. The technical work, the process de velopment work, and the constr uction of three new oil-from- coal plants in the United States was placed in the hands of the St andard Oil Development Company, the Standard Oil tec hnical subsidiary. It is clear from these contemporary reports that the development work on oil from coal was undertaken by Standard Oil of New Jersey within the United States, in St andard Oil plants and with majo rity financing and control by Standard. The results of this re search were made available to I.G. Farben and became the basis for the development of Hitler's oil from-c oal-program which made World War II possible. The Haslam article, written by a former Professor of Chemical Engineering at M.I.T. (then vice president of Standard Oil of New Jersey) argued — contrary to these recorded facts — that Standard Oil was able, throu gh its Farben agreements, to obtain German technology for the United States. Haslam cited the manufacture of toluol and p aratone ( O p - p anol ) , used to"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"stabilize viscosity of oil, an essential materi al for desert and Russia n winter tank operations, and buna rubber. However, this article, with its erroneous self-servi ng claims, found its way to wartime Germany and became the subject of a \"Secret\" I. G. Farben memorandum dated June 6, 1944 from Nuremburg de fendent and then-Farben offici al von Knieriem to fellow Farben management officials. This yon Knieriem \"Secret\" memo set out those facts Haslam avoided in his Petroleum Times article. The memo was in fact a summary of what Standard was unwilling to reveal to th e American public — i.e., the major contribution made by Standard Oil of New Jersey to the Nazi war machine. The Fa rben memorandum states that the Standard Oil agreements were absolutely essential for I.G. Farben: The closing of an agreement with St andard was necessary for technical, commercial, and financial reasons:technically, because the specialized experience which was available only in a big oil company was necessary to the further development of our process, and no such industry ex isted in Germany; commercially, because in the absence of state economic control in Germany at that time, IG had to avoid a competitive struggle with the great oil powers, who always sold the best ga soline at the lowest pri ce in contested markets; financially, because IG, which had already sp ent extraordinarily large sums for the development of the process, had to seek financial relief in order to be able to continue development in othe r new technical fields, such as buna. 8 The Farben memorandum then answered the ke y question: What did I.G. Farben acquire from Standard Oil that was \"vital for th e conduct of war?\" The memo examines those products cited by Haslam — i.e ., iso-octane, tuluol , Oppanol-Paratone, and buna — and demonstrates that contrary to Standard Oil' s public claim, their t echnology came to a great extent from the U.S., not from Germany. On iso-octane the Farben memorandum reads, in part, By reason of their decades of work on motor fuels, the Americans were ahead of us in their knowledge of the quality requirements t hat are called for by the different uses of motor fuels. In particular they had developed, at great expense, a large number of methods of testing gasolin e for different uses. On the basis of their experiments they had recognized the good anti, knock quality of iso-octane long before they had any knowledge of our hydrogenation process. This is proved by the single fact that in America fuels are graded in octane numbers, and iso-octane was entere d as the best fuel with the number 100. All this knowledge naturally became ours as a result of the agreement, which saved us much effort and protected us against many errors. I.G. Farben adds that Haslam's claim that the production of iso-oc tane became known in America only through the Farben hydrogenation process was not correct: Especially in the case of iso-octane, it is shown that we owe much to the Americans because in our own work we could draw widely on American information on the behavior of fuels in motors. Moreover, we were also kept currently informed by the Americans on the progress of their production process and its further development. Shortl y be f ore the war, a new method f or the production o f iso-octane was"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"found in America — alkylation with isom erization as a preliminary step. This process, which Mr. Haslain does not mention at all, originates in fact entirely with the Americans and has become known to us in detail in its separate stages through our agreements with them, and is being used very extensively by us. On toluol, I.G. Farben points to a factual inaccuracy in the Haslam article: toluol was not produced by hydrogenation in the U.S. is clai med by Professor Haslam. In the case of Oppanol, the I.G. memo calls Ha slam's information \"incomplete\" and so far as buna rubber is concerned, \"we never gave technical information to the Americans, nor did technical cooperation in the buna field take place.\" Most importantly, the Farben memo goes on to describe some products not ci ted by Haslam in his article: As a consequence of our contracts with the Americans, we received from them, above and beyond the agreement, many ver y valuable contri butions for the synthesis and improvement of motor fuel s and lubricating oils, which Just now during the war are most useful to us ; and we also received other advantages from them. Primarily, the following may be mentioned: (1) Above all, improvement of fuels through the addition of tetraethyl-lead and the manufacture of this product. It n eed not be especial ly mentioned that without tetraethl-lead the present methods of warfare would be impossible. The fact that since the beginning of the wa r we could produce tetraethyl-lead is entirely due to the circumstances t hat, shortly before, the Americans had presented us with the production plans, co mplete with their know-how. It was, moreover, the first time that the Americ ans decided to give a license on this process in a foreign country (besides communication of unpr otected secrets) and this only on our urgent requests to Standard O il to fulfill our wish. Contractually we c ould not demand it, and we found out later that the War Department in Washington gave its perm ission only after long deliberation. (2) Conversion of low-molecular unsaturates into usable gasoline (polymerization). Much work in this field has been done here as well as in America. But the Americans were the first to carry the process through on a large scale, which suggested to us also to develop the process on a large technical scale. But above and beyond t hat, plants built according to American processes are functioning in Germany. (3) In the field of lubricating oils as well, Germany through the contract with America, learned of experie nce which is extraordinaril y important for present day warfare. In this connection, we obtained not only the experience of Standard, but, through Standard, the experiences of General Motors and other large American motor companies as well. (4) As a further remarkable example of advantageous effect for us of the contract between IG and Standard Oil, th e following should be mentioned: in the years 1934 / 1935 our government had th e greatest interest in gathering from abroad a stock of esp ecially valuable mineral oi l products (in particular, aviation g asoline and aviation lubricatin g oil), and holdin g it in reserve to an"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"amount approximately equal to 20 million dollars at market value. The German Government asked IG if it were not pos sible, on the basis o fits friendly relations with Standard Oil, to buy this amount in Farben's name; actually, however, as trustee of the German Gover nment. The fact that we actually succeeded by means of the most diffic ult negotiations in buying the quantity desired by our government from the American Standard Oi l Company and the Dutch — English Royal — Dutch — Shell group and in transporting it to Germany, was made possible only thro ugh the aid of the Standard Oil Co. Ethyl Lead for the Wehrmacht Another prominent example of Standard Oil a ssistance to Nazi Germany — in cooperation with General Motors — was in supplying ethyl lead. Ethyl fluid is an anti-knock compound used in both aviation and automobile fuels to eliminate knocking, and so improve engine efficiency; without such anti-knocking com pounds modern mobile warfare would be impractical. In 1924 the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation was form ed in New York City, jointly owned by the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and General Motors Corporation, to control and utilize U.S. patents for the manufacture and dist ribution of tetraethyl lead and ethyl fluid in the U.S. and abroad. Up to 1935 manuf acture of these produc ts was undertaken only in the United States. In 1935 Ethyl Ga soline Corporation transferre d its know-how to Germany for use in the Nazi rearmament pr ogram. This transfer was undert aken over the protests of the U.S. Government. Ethyl's intention to transfer its anti-knoc k technology to Nazi Germany came to the attention of the Army Air Corps in Washington, D.C. On December 15, 1934 E. W. Webb, president of Ethyl Gasoline, wa s advised that Washington had learned of the intention of \"forming a German company with the I.G. to manufacture ethyl lead in that country.\" The War Department indicated that there was considerable crit icism of this technological transfer, which might \"have th e gravest repercussions\" for th e U.S.; that the commercial demand for ethyl lead in Germany was too small to be of interest; and, ... it has been claimed that Germany is secretly arming [ and] ethyl lead would doubtless be a valuable aid to military aeroplanes. 10 The Ethyl Company was then advised by the Army Air Corps that \"under no conditions should you or the Board of Directors of the Et hyl Gasoline Corporation disclose any secrets or 'know-how' in connection with the manuf acture of tetraethyl lead to Germany. 11 On January 12, 1935 Webb mailed to the Chief of the Army Ai r Corps a \"Statement of Facts,\" which was in effect a denial that any such technical knowledge would be transmitted; he offered to insert such a clau se in the contract to guard against any such transfer. However, contrary to its pledge to the Army Air Co rps, Ethyl subsequently signed a joint production agreement with I.G. Farben in Germany to form Ethyl G.m.b.H. and with Montecatini in fascist Italy for the same purpose. It is worth noting the di rectors of Ethyl Gasoline Corporation at the ti me of this transfer: 12 E.W. Webb, p resident and director; C.F. Ketterin g ; R.P. Russell; W.C. Tea g le, Standard Oil"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"of New Jersey and trustee of FDR's Georgia Warm Springs Foundation; F. A. Howard; E. M. Clark, Standard Oil of New Je rsey; A. P. Sloan, Jr.; D. Br own; J. T. Smith; and W.S. Parish of Standard Oil of New Jersey. The I.G. Farben files captured at the end of the war confirm th e importance of this particular technical transfer for the German Wehrmacht: Since the beginning of the war we ha ve been in a position. to produce lead tetraethyl solely because, a short time before the outbreak of the war, the Americans had established plants for us ready for production and supplied us with all available experience. In this manner we did not need to perform the difficult work of develop ment because we could st art production right away on the basis of all the experience th at the Americans had had for years. 13 In 1938, just before the outbrea k of war in Europe, the Germ an Luftwaffe had an urgent requirement for 500 tons of tetr aethyl lead. Ethyl was advised by an official of DuPont that such quantities of ethyl would be used by Germany for military purposes. 14 This 500 tons was loaned by the Ethyl Export Co rporation of New York to Et hyl G.m.b.H. of Germany, in a transaction arranged by the Reich Air Ministry with I.G. Farben director Mueller-Cunradi. The collateral security was arranged in a letter da ted September 21, 1938 15 through Brown Brothers, Harriman & Co. of New York. Standard Oil of New Jersey and Synthetic Rubber The transfer of ethyl technology for the Nazi war mach ine was repeated in the case of synthetic rubber. There is no question that th e ability of the German Wehrmacht to fight World War II depended on synthe tic rubber — as well as on s ynthetic petrol eum — because Germany has no natural rubber, and war woul d have been impossible without Farben's synthetic rubber production. Farben had a virtual monopoly of th is field and the program to produce the large quantities necessary was financed by the Reich: The volume of planned production in th is field was far beyond the needs of peacetime economy. The huge costs involved were consistent only with military considerations in which the need for se lf-sufficiency without regard to cost was decisive. 16 As in the ethyl technology transf ers, Standard Oil of New Jers ey was intimately associated with I.G. Farben's synthetic rubbe r. A series of joint cartel agr eements were made in the late 1920s aimed at a joint world monop oly of synthetic rubber. Hitl er's Four Year Plan went into effect in 1937 and in 1938 Standard provided I.G. Farb en with its new butyl rubber process. On the other hand Standard kept the German buna process secr et within the United States and it was not until June 1940 that Fi restone and U.S. Rubber were allowed to participate in testing butyl and granted the buna manufacturing licenses. Even then Standard tried to get the U.S. Governme nt to finance a large-scale buna program — reserving its own funds for the more promising butyl process. 17 Consequently, Standard assistance in Nazi Germany was not limited to oil from coal, althou g h this was the most im p ortant transfer. Not onl y was the p rocess for tetraeth y l"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"transferred to I.G. Farben and a plant built in Germany owned jointly by I.G., General Motors, and Standard subsidia ries; but as late as 1939 Sta ndard's German subsidiary designed a German plant for aviation gas. Tetr aethyl was shipped on an emergency basis for the Wehrmacht and major assistan ce was given in production of butyl rubber, while holding secret in the U.S. the Farben process for buna. In other words, Standard Oil of New Jersey (first under president W.C. Teagle and then unde r W..S. Farish) consistently aided the Nazi war machine while refusing to aid the United States. This sequence of events was not an accident. Pr esident W.S. Farish argued that not to have granted such technical as sistance to the Wehrmacht \"... would have been unwarranted.\" 18 The assistance was knowledgeable, ranged over mo re than a decade, and was so substantive that without it the Wehrmacht c ould not have gone to war in 1939. The Deutsche-Amerikanische Petroleum A.G. (DAPAG) The Standard Oil subsidiary in Germany, Deutsche-Amerikanische Petroleum A.G. (DAPAG), was 94-percent owned by Standard Oil of New Jersey. DAPAG had branches throughout Germany, a refinery at Bremen, and a head office in Hamburg. Through DAPAG, Standard Oil of New Jersey was repres ented in the inner circles of Naziism — the Keppler Circle and Himmler' s Circle of Friends. A dire ctor of DAPAG was Karl Lindemann, also chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce in Germany, as well as director of several banks, including the Dresdner Bank, the Deutsche Reichsbank, and the private Nazi-oriented bank of C. Melchi or & Company, and numerous corporations including the HAPAG (Hamburg- Amerika Line). Lindemann wa s a member of Keppler's Circle of Friends as la te as 1944 and so gave Standard Oil of New Jersey a representative at the very core of Naziism. Another member of the board of DAPAG was Emil Helfrich, who was an original member of the Keppler Circle. In sum, Standard Oil of New Jersey had two me mbers of the Keppler Ci rcle as directors of its German wholly owned subs idiary. Payments to the Circ le from the Standard Oil subsidiary company, and from Lindemann and Helffrich as indi vidual directors, continued until 1944, the year before the end of World War II. 19 Footnotes: 1 In 1935, John D.

It is interesting to note in passing that while Sosthenes Be hn's I.T.T. controlled telephone companies and manufacturing plants in German y, the cable traffic between the U.S. and Germany was under the control of Deutsch-Atlantische Tele graphengesellschaft (the German Atlantic Cable Comp any). This firm, together with the Commercial Cable Company and Western Union Te legraph Company, had a monopoly in transatlantic U.S.- German cable communications. W.A. Harr iman & Company took over a block of 625,000 shares in Deutsch-Atlantische in 1925, and the firm's board of directors included an unusual array of characters, many of whom we have met elsewhere. It included, for example, H. F. Albert, the German espionage agent in the Un ited States in World War I; Franklin D. Roosevelt's former business associate yon Berenberg-Gossl er; and Dr. Cuno, a former German chancellor of the 1923 inflationary era. I.T.T. in the United States was represented on the board by yon Guilleaume and Max Warburg of the Warburg banking family Baron Kurt von Schroder and the I.T.T. There is no record that I.T.T. ma de direct payments to Hitler before the Nazi grab for power in 1933. On the other hand, numerous payments we re made to Heinrich Himmler in the late 1930s and in World War II itse lf through I.T.T. German subs idiaries. The first meeting between Hitler and I.T.T. officials — so far as we know — was reported in August 1933, 3 when Sosthenes Behn and I.T.T. German repres entative Henry Manne met with Hitler in Berchesgaden. Subsequently, Behn made contact with the Keppler circ le (see Chapter Nine) and, through Keppler's influence, Nazi Ba ron Kurt von Schröder became the guardian of I.T.T. interests in Germany. Schröder acted as the conduit for I.T.T. money funneled to Heinrich Himmler's S.S. organization in 1944, while World War II was in progress, and the United states was at war with Germany. 4 Through Kurt Schröder, Behn and his I.T.T. gained access to the profitable German armaments industry and bought substantial intere st in German armame nts firms, including Focke-Wolfe aircraft. These armaments operati ons made handsome pr ofits, which could have been repatriated to the United States parent company. But they were reinvested in German rearmament. This reinve stment of profits in German armament firms suggests that Wall Street claims it was innocent of wrongdoing in Germ an rearmament — and indeed did not even know of Hitl er's intentions — are fraudulent. Sp ecifically, I.T.T. purchase of a substantial interest in Focke-Wolfe meant, as Anthony Sampson has pointed out, that I.T.T. was producing German planes used to kill Am ericans and their alli es — and it made excellent p rofits out of the enter p rise."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"In Kurt von Schröder, I.T.T. ha d access to the very heart of the Nazi pow er elite. Who was Schröder? Baron Kurt von Schröder was born in Hamburg in 1889 into an old, established German banking family. An earlier member of the Schröder family moved to London, changed his name to Schroder (without the dierisis) and orga nized the banking firm of J. Henry Schroder in London and J. Henry Schrode r Banking Corporation in New York. Kurt von Schröder also became a partner in the private Cologne Bankha us, J. H. Stein & Company, founded in the late eighteenth century. Both Sc hröder and Stein had been promoters, in company with French financie rs, of the 1919 German separatist movement which attempted to split the rich Rhineland away from Germany and its troubles. In this escapade prominent Rhineland i ndustrialists met at J. H. Stein's house on January 7, 1919 and a few months later organi zed a meeting, with Stein as chairman, to develop public support for the separatist m ovement. The 1919 action failed. The group tried again in 1923 and spearheaded another movement to break the Rhineland away from Germany to come under the protection of France. This attempt also failed. Kurt yon Schr ader then linked up with Hitler and the early Nazis, and as in the 1919 a nd 1923 Rhineland separatist movements, Schröder represented and worked for German industrialists and armaments manufacturers. In exchange for financial a nd industrial support arranged by yon Schrader, he later gained political prestige. Immediatel y after the Nazis gained power in 1933 Schrader became the German representative at the Bank for International Settlements, which Quigley calls the apex of the international control system, as well as head of the private bankers group advising the German Re ichsbank. Heinrich Himmler appoint ed Sehroder an S.S. Senior Group Leader, and in turn Him mler became a prominent member of Keppler's Circle. (See Chapter Nine.)

Th e group included not only Kurt von Schröder and Westrick but also Franz yon Papen — whom we shall meet in company with James Paul Warburg of the Bank of Manhattan in Chapte r Ten — and Dr. Heinri ch Albert. Albert, supposedly German commercial attache in the U.S. in World War I, was actua lly in charge of financing yon Papen's espi onage program. After World War I Westrick and Albert formed the law firm of Albert & Westrick which specialize d in, and profited heavily from, the Wall Street reparations lo ans. The Albert & Westrick firm handled the German end of the J Henry Schroder Banking loans, while the John Foster Dulles firm of Sullivan and Cromwell in New York handled the U.S. end of the Schroder loans. Just prior to World War II the Albert-Papen -Westrick espionage ope ration in the United States began to repeat itself, only this time ar ound the American authori ties were more alert. Westrick came to the U.S. in 1940, supposedly as a commercial attache but in fact as Ribbentrop's personal representative. A stream of visitors to the influential Westrick in- eluded prominent directors of U.S. petroleum and industr ial firms, and this brought Westrick to the attention of the FBI. Westrick at this time became a director of all I.T.T. op erations in Germany, in order to protect I.T.T. interests during the expected U.S. involvement in the European war. 8 Among his other enterprises Westrick attempted to persuade Henry Ford to cut off supplies to Britain, and the favored treatme nt given by the Nazis to Ford interests in France suggests that Westrick was partially successful in neutralizing U.S. aid to Britain. Although Westrick's most importa nt wartime business connection in the United States was with International Telephone and Telegraph, he also represented other U.S. firms, including Underwood Elliott Fisher, owner of the Germ an company Mercedes Buromaschinen A.G.; Eastman Kodak, which had a K odak subsidiary in Germany; and the International Milk Corporation, with a Hamburg subsidiary. Among Westrick's deals (and the one which received the most publicity) was a contract fo r Texaco to supply oil to the German Navy, which he arranged with Torkild Rieber, ch airman of the board of Texaco Company. In 1940 Rieber discussed an oil deal with Hermann Goering, and Wes trick in the United States worked for Texas Oil Company. His au tomobile was bought with Texaco funds, and Westrick's driver's license appl ication gave Texaco as his bus iness address. These activities were publicized on August 12, 1940. Rieber su bsequently resigned from Texaco and Westrick returned to Germany. Two years late r Rieber was chairman of South Carolina Shipbuilding and Dry Docks, supervising cons truction of more than $10 million of U.S. Navy ships, and a director of the Guggenheim family's Barb er Asphalt Corporation and Seaboard Oil Company of Ohio. 9 I.T.T. in Wartime Germany In 1939 I.T.T. in the United States controlled Standard Elektrizitats in Germany, and in turn Standard Elektrizitats controlled 94 percent of Mix & Genest.

The interrogation of Kurt von Schröder on November 19, 1945 points up the deliberate nature of the close a nd profitable relationship between Colonel Sosthenes Behn of I.T.T., Westrick, Schröder, and th e Nazi war machine during World War II, and that this was a deliberate and knowledg eable relationship: Q.

The Lorenz Company, shortly be fore the war, took a participation of about 25 percent in Focke-Wolfe A.G. in Bremen. Fock e-Wolfe was making airplanes for the German Air Ministry. I believe th at later as Focke-Wolfe expanded and took in more capital that the interest of Lorenz Company dropped a little below this 25 percent. Q.

(Josiah E. Dubois, Jr, Generals in Grey Suits, London: The Bodley Head, 1953, p. 250.) Henry Ford is often seen to be something of an enigma among the Wall Street elite. For many years in the 20s and 30s Ford was popularly known as an enemy of the financial establishment. Ford accused Morgan and others of using war and revolution as a road to profit and their influence in social systems as a means of personal advancem ent. By 1938 Henry Ford, in his public statements, had divi ded financiers into tw o classes: those who profited from war and used their influen ce to bring about war for profit, and the \"constructive\" financiers. Am ong the latter group he now incl uded the House of Morgan. During a 1938 New York Times interview 1 Ford averred that: Somebody once said that sixt y families have directed th e destinies of the nation. It might well be said that if somebody would focus th e spotlight on twenty-five persons who handle the nation' s finances, the world's re al warmakers would be brought into bold relief. The Times reporter asked Ford how he equated th is assessment with his long-standing criticism of the House of Morgan, to which Ford replied: There is a constructive and a destruct ive Wall Street. The House of Morgan represents the constructive. I have kn own Mr. Morgan for many years. He backed and supported Thomas Edison, who was also my good friend .... After expounding on the evils of limited agricu ltural production — alle gedly brought about by Wall Street — Ford continued, ... if these financiers had their way we'd be in a war now. They want war because they make money out of such con flict — out of the human misery that wars bring. On the other hand, when we probe behind these public statements we find that Henry Ford and son Edsel Ford have been in the forefront of American businessm en who try to walk both sides of every ideological fe nce in search of profit. Using Ford's own criteria, the Fords are among the \"destructive\" elements. It was Henry Ford who in the 1930s built the Soviet Union's first modern automobile plant (located at Gorki) and which in the 50s a nd 60s produced the trucks used by the North Vietnamese to carr y wea p ons and munitions for use a g ainst Americans. 2 At about the same"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"time, Henry Ford was also the most famous of Hitler's foreign backers, and he was rewarded in the 1930s for this long-lasting support with the highest Nazi decoration for foreigners. This Nazi favor aroused a st orm of controversy in the Un ited States and ultimately degenerated into an exchange of diplomatic notes between th e German Government and the State Department. While Ford publicly protes ted that he did not like totalitarian governments, we find in practi ce that Ford knowingly profit ed from both sides of World War II — from French and Germ an plants producing vehicles at a profit for the Wehrmacht, and from U.S. plants building vehicles at a profit for the U.S. Army. Henry Ford's protestations of i nnocence suggest, as we shall see in this ch apter, that he did not approve of Jewish financie rs profiting from war (as some have), but if anti-Semitic Morgan 3 and Ford profited from war that was acceptable, moral and \"constructive.\" Henry Ford: Hitler's First Foreign Backer On December 20, 1922 the New York Times reported 4 that automobile manufacturer Henry Ford was financing Adolph Hitl er's nationalist and anti-Se mitic movements in Munich. Simultaneously, the Berlin newspaper Berliner Tageblatt appealed to the American Ambassador in Berlin to investigate and ha lt Henry Ford's intervention into German domestic affairs. It was reporte d that Hitler's foreign back ers had furnished a \"spacious headquarters\" with a \"host of highly paid lieutenants and offi cials.\" Henry Ford's portrait was prominently displayed on the wa lls of Hitler's personal office: The wall behind his desk in Hitler's private office is decorated with a large picture of Henry Ford. In the antechamber there is a large table covered with books, nearly all of which are a transla tion of a book written and published by Henry Ford. 5 The same New York Times report commented that the previ ous Sunday Hitler had reviewed, The so-called Storming Battalion.., 1,000 young men in brand new uniforms and armed with revolvers and blackjacks, while Hitler and his henchmen drove around in two powerful brand-new autos. The Times made a clear distinction between the Ge rman monarchist parties and Hitler's anti-Semitic fascist party. Henry Ford, it was noted, ignored the Hohe nzollern monarchists and put his money into the Hitlerite revolutionary movement. These Ford funds were used by Hi tler to foment the Bavarian rebellion. The rebellion failed, and Hitler was captured and subse quently brought to trial. In Fe bruary 1923 at the trial, vice president Auer of the Bavarian Diet testified: The Bavarian Diet has long had the inform ation that the Hitler movement was partly financed by an Amer ican anti-Semitic chief, who is Henry Ford. Mr. Ford's interest in the Bavarian anti- Semitic movement began a year ago when one of Mr. Ford's agents, seeking to sell tractors , came in contact with Diedrich Eichart, the notorious Pan-German. Shortl y a f ter, Herr Eichart asked"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Mr. Ford's agent for financial aid. The agent returned to America and immediately Mr. Ford's mon ey began coming to Munich. Herr Hitler openly boasts of Mr. Ford 's support and praises Mr. Ford as a great individualist and a great anti-Semite. A photogr aph of Mr. Ford hangs in Herr Hitler's quarters, which is th e center of monarchist movement. 6 Hitler received a mild and co mfortable prison sentence for his Bavarian revolutionary activities. The rest from more act ive pursuits enabled him to write Mein Kampf. Henry Ford's book, The International Jew, earlier circulated by the Nazi s, was translated by them into a dozen languages, and Hitler utilized sections of the book verbatim in writing Mein Kampf . 7 We shall see later that Hitler's backing in th e late 20s and early 30s came from the chemical, steel, and electrical industry cartels, rather than directly from individual industrialists. In 1928 Henry Ford merged his German assets with those of the I. G. Farben chemical cartel. A substantial holding, 40 percent of Ford Motor A.G. of Germany, was transferred to I.G. Farben; Carl Bosch of I.G. Farben became head of Ford A.G. Motor in Germany. Simultaneously, in the United St ates Edsel Ford joined the boa rd of American I.G. Farben. (See Chapter Two.) Henry Ford Receives a Nazi Medal A decade later, in August 1938 — after Hitler had achieved power with the aid of the cartels — Henry Ford received the Grand Cross of the German Eagle, a Nazi decoration for distinguished foreigners. The New York Times reported it was the firs t time the Grand Cross had been awarded in the United States and was to celebrate Henr y Ford's 75th birthday. 8 The decoration raised a storm of criticism within Zionist circles in the U.S. Ford backed off to the extent of publicly meeting with Rabbi Leo Franklin of Detroit to express his sympathy for the plight of German Jews: My acceptance of a medal from the German people [said Ford] does not, as some people seem to think, involve any sympathy on my part with naziism. Those who have known me for many years realize that anything that breeds hate is repulsive to me. 9 The Nazi medal issue was picked up in a Clevel and speech by Secretary of Interior Harold Ickes. Ickes criticized both Henry Ford and Colonel Charle s A. Lindbergh for accepting Nazi medals. The curious part of the Ickes speech, made at a Cleveland Zi onist Society banquet, was his criticism of \"wealthy Jews\" and their acquisition and use of wealth: A mistake made by a non -Jewish millionaire refle cts upon him alone, but a false step made by a Jewi sh man of wealth reflects upon his whole race. This is harsh and unjust, but it is a fact that must be faced. 10 Perhaps Ickes was tangentially referring to the roles of the Warburgs in the I.G. Farben cartel: Warburgs were on the board of I.G. Farben in the U.S. and Germany. In 1938 the Warbur g s were bein g e j ected b y the Nazis from German y . Other German Jews, such as the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Oppenheim bankers, made their peace with the Nazis and were gr anted \"honorary Aryan status.\" Ford Motor Company Assist s the German War Effort A post-war Congressional subc ommittee investigating Amer ican support for the Nazi military effort described the manner in which the Nazis succeed ed in obtaining U.S. technical and financ ial assistance as \"quite fantastic. 11 Among other evidence the Committee was shown a memorandum prepared in the offices of Ford-Werke A.G. on November 25, 1941, written by Dr. H. F. Albert to R. H. Schm idt, then president of the board of Ford-Werke A.G. The memo cited th e advantages of having a majority of the German firm held by Ford Motor Company in Detroit. German Ford had been able to exchange Ford parts for rubber and critic al war materials needed in 1938 and 1939 \"and they would not have been able to do that if Ford had not b een owned by the United States.\" Further, with a majority American interest Ge rman Ford would \"more eas ily be able to step in and dominate the Ford hol dings throughout Europe.\" It was even reported to the Committee that two top German Ford officials had been in a bitter personal feud about who was to control Ford of England, such \"that one of them finally got up and left the room in disgust.\" According to evidence presented to the Committee, Ford-Werke A.G. was technically transformed in the late 1930s into a German company. All ve hicles and their parts were produced in Germany, by German workers usi ng German materials unde r German direction and exported to European and ov erseas territories of the Unit ed States and Great Britain. Any needed foreign raw materials, rubber a nd nonferrous metals, were obtained through the American Ford Company. American influence had been more or less converted into a supporting position (Hilfsstellung) for the German Ford plants. At the outbreak of the war Fo rd-Werke placed itself at the disposal of the Wehrmacht for armament production. It was assumed by the Nazis that as long as Ford-Werke A.G. had an American majority, it would be possible to bring the remain ing European Ford companies under German influence — i.e., that of Ford-W erke A.G. — and so ex ecute Nazi \"Greater European\" policies in the Ford plants in Am sterdam, Antwerp, Paris, Budapest, Bucharest, and Copenhagen: A majority, even if only a small one, of Americans is essential for the transmittal of the newest American models, as well as American production and sales methods. With the abolition of th e American majority, this advantage, as well as the intervention of the Ford Motor Company to obtain raw materials and exports, would be lost, and the German plant would prac tically only be worth its machine capacity. 12 And, of course, this kind of strict neutrality, taking an international rather than a national viewpoint, had earlier paid of f for Ford Motor Company in the Soviet Union, where Ford was held in high regard as the ultimate of te chnical and economic effici ency to be achieved by the Stak-hanovites. In July 1942 word filtered back to Washington from Ford of France about Ford's activities on behalf of the German war effort in Euro p e. The incriminatin g information was p rom p tl y"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"buried and even today only part of the known documentation can be traced in Washington. We do know, however, that the U.S. Consul Ge neral in Algeria had possession of a letter from Maurice Dollfuss of French Ford — who claimed to be the first Frenchman to go to Berlin after the fall of France — to Edsel Ford about a plan by which Ford Motor could contribute to the Nazi war effo rt. French Ford was able to produce 20 trucks a day for the Wehrmacht, which [wrote Dollfuss] is better than, ... our less fortunate French competitors are doing. The reason is that our trucks are in very large demand by th e German authorities and I believe that as long as the war goes on and at least for so me period of time, all that we shall produce will be taken by the German authorities .... I will satisfy myself by telling you that... the attitude you have take n, together with your father, of strict neutrality, has been an invaluable asse t for the production of your companies in Europe. 13 Dollfuss disclosed that profit s from this German business were already 1.6 million francs, and net profits for 1941 were no less than 58,000,000 francs — because the Germans paid promptly for Ford's output. On receipt of this news Edsel Ford cabled: Delighted to hear you are making progress. Your lette rs most interesting. Fully realize great handicap you are worki ng under. Hope you and family well. Regards. s/ Edsel Ford 14 Although there is evidence that European plan ts owned by Wall Street interests were not bombed by the U.S. Air Force in World War II, this re striction apparently did not reach the British Bombing Command. In March 1942 the Royal Air Force bombed the Ford plant at Poissy, France. A subseq uent letter from Edse l Ford to Ford General Manager Sorenson about this RAF raid commented, \"Photographs of the plant on fire were published in American newspapers but fortunately no reference was made to the Ford Motor Company. 15 In any event, the Vichy government paid Ford Motor Company 38 million francs as compensation for damage done to the Poissy plant. This wa s not reported in the U.S. press and would hardly be appreciated by those Americ ans at war with Naziism. Dubois asserts that these private messages from Ford in Europe were passed to Edsel Ford by Assistant Secretary of Stat e Breckenridge Long. This was the same Secretary Long who one year later suppressed private messages through the State De partment concerning the extermination of Jews in Euro pe. 16 Disclosure of those me ssages conceivably could have been used to assist those desperate people. A U.S. Air Force bombing intelligence report written in 1943 noted that, Principal wartime activities [of the Ford plant] are probably manufacture of light trucks and of spare parts for all the Ford trucks and cars in service in Axis Europe (including captured Russian Molotovs). 16 The Russian Molotovs were of course manufactured by the Fo rd-built works at Gorki, Russia.

The main building contained about 500 machine tools, \"all imported from the United States and including a fair sprinkl ing of the more complex types, such as Gleason gear cutters, Bullard automatics and Ingersoll borers. 17 Ford also extended its wartime activities in to North Africa. In December 1941 a new Ford Company, Ford-Afrique, was regi stered in France and granted all the rights of the former Ford Motor Company, Ltd. of England in Alge ria, Tunisia, French Morocco, French Equatorial, and French West Afri ca. North Africa was not accessi ble to British Ford so this new Ford Company — registered in German-o ccupied France — was organized to fill the gap. The directors were pr o-Nazi and included Mauri ce Dollfuss (Edsel Ford's correspondent) and Roger Messis (described by the U.S. Algier s Consul General as \"known to this office by repute as unscrupulous, is stated to be a 100 percent pro-German\") 18 The U.S. Consul General also reported th at propaganda was common in Algiers about ... the collaboration of French-Germa n-American capital and the questionable sincerity of the American war effort, [there] is al ready pointing an accusing finger at a transaction Which has been for long a subject of discussion in commercial circles. 19 In brief, there is documentary evidence that Ford Motor Company worked on both sides of World War II. If the Nazi industr ialists brought to trial at Nure mburg were guilty of crimes against mankind, then so must be their fellow collaborators in the Ford family, Henry and Edsel Ford. However, the Ford story wa s concealed by Washingt on — apparently like almost everything else that could touch upon the name and su stenance of th e Wall Street financial elite.

The only published examination of Hitler's pers onal finances is an article by Oron James Hale, \"Adolph Hitler: Taxpayer, 1 which records Adolph's brus hes with the German tax authorities before he became Reichskanzler, In the 1920s Hitler presented himself to the German tax man as merely an impoverished writer living on ba nk loans, with an automobile .bought on credit. Unfortunately, the original records used by Hale do not yield the source of Hitler's income, loans, or credit, and German law \"did not require self- employed or professional persons to disclose in detail the sources of in come or the nature of services rendered.\" 2 Obviously the funds for the auto mobiles, private secretary Rudolf Hess, another assistant, a chauffeur, and expe nses incurred by political activity, came from somewhere. But, like Leon Trotsky's 1917 stay in New York, it is hard to reconcile Hitler's known expenditures with the pr ecise source of his income. Some Early Hitler Backers We do know that prominent European and Am erican industrialists were sponsoring all manner of totalitarian political groups at that time, including Communi sts and various Nazi groups. The U.S. Kilgore Committee records that: By 1919 Krupp was already gi ving financial aid to one of the reactionary political groups which sowed the seed of the present Nazi ideology. Hugo Stinnes was an early contri butor to the Nazi Party (National Socialistische Deutsche Arbeiter Partei). By 1924 other prominent industrialists and financiers, among them Fritz Th yssen, Albert Voegler, Adolph [sic] Kirdorf, and Kurt von Schroder, were secretly giving substantial sums to the Nazis. In 1931 members of the coalowners' associ ation which Kirdorf headed pledged themselves to pay 50 pfennigs for each ton of' coal sold, the money to go to the organization which Hi tler was building. 3 Hitler's 1924 Munich trial yielded evidence that the Nazi Party received $20,000 from Nuremburg industrialists. The most interesting name from this period is that of Emil Kirdorf, who had earlier ac ted as conduit for financing German involvement in the Bolshevik Revolution. 4 Kirdorfs role in financing Hitler was, in his own words: In 1923 I came into contact for the fi rst time with the National-Socialist movement .... I first heard the Fuehrer in the Essen Exhibition Hall. His clear exposition completely convinced and ov erwhelmed me. In 1927 I first met the Fuehrer personally. I travelled to Muni ch and there had a conversation with the Fuehrer in the Bruc kmann home. During four and a half hours Adolf Hitler explained to me his programme in de tail. I then begged the Fuehrer to put to g ether the lecture he had g iven me in the f orm o f a pamphlet. I then"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"distributed this pamphlet in my name in business and manufacturing circles. Since then I have placed my self completely at the di sposition of his movement, Shortly after our Munich conversation, and as a result of the pamphlet which the Fuehrer composed and I distribute d, a number of meetings took place between the Fuehrer and leading personalitie s in the field of indus. try. For the last time before th e taking over of power, the le aders of industry met in my house together with Adolf Hitler, Rudolf Hess, Hermann Goering and other leading personalities of the party. 5 In 1925 the Hugo Stinnes family contributed funds to convert the Nazi weekly Volkischer Beobachter to a daily publication. Putz i Hanf-staengl, Franklin D. Roosevelt's friend and protegé, provided the remaining funds. 6 Table 7-1 summarizes presently known financial contributions and the business a ssociations of contributors fro m the United States. Putzi is not listed in Table 7-1 as he was neither industrialist nor financier. In the early 1930s financial assistance to Hi tler began to flow more readily. There took place in Germany a series of meetings, irrefutably documented in several sources, between German industrialists, Hitler himself, and more often Hitler's representatives Hjalmar Sehaeht and Rudolf Hess. The critical point is that the German i ndustrialists financing Hitler were predominantly dire ctors of cartels with Americ an associations, ownership, participation, or some form of subsidiary connection. The Hi tler backers were not, by and large, firms of purely German origin, or representative of German family business. Except for Thyssen and Kirdoff, in most cases they were the German multi-national firms — i.e., I.G. Farben, A.E.G., DAPAG, etc. These multi-nationals had been built up by American loans in the 1920s, an d in the early 1930s had American directors and heavy American financial participation. One flow of foreign political f unds not considered here is th at reported from the European- based Royal Dutch Shell, Standa rd Oil's great competitor in the 20s and 30s, and the giant brainchild of Anglo-Du tch businessman Sir Henr i Deterding. It has be en widely asserted that Henri Deterding personally financed Hitle r. This argument is made, for instance, by biographer Glyn Roberts in The Most Powerful Man in the World. Roberts notes that Deterding was impressed with Hitler as early as 1921: ...and the Dutch press reported that, through the agent Georg Bell, he [Deterding] had placed at Hi tler's disposal, while the party was \"still in long clothes,\" no less than four million guilders. 7 It was reported (by Roberts) that in 1931 Geor g Bell, Deterding's agent, attended meetings of Ukrainian Patriots in Paris \"as jo int delegate of Hitler and Deterding.\" 8 Roberts also reports: Deterding was accused, as Edgar Ansell Mowrer testifies in his Germany Puts the Clock Back, of putting up a large sum of money for the Nazis on the understanding that success would give him a more favored position in the German oil market. On other occasi ons, figures as high as £55,000,000 were mentioned. 9 "},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Biographer Roberts really found Deterding's str ong anti-Bolshevism distasteful, and rather than present hard evidence of funding he is inclined to assume rather than prove that Deterding was pro-Hitler. But pro-Hitlerism is not a nece ssary consequence of anti- Bolshevism; in any event Robe rts offers no proof of finance, and hard evidence of Deterding's involvement was not found by this author. Mowrer's book contains neither i ndex nor footnotes as to the source of his information and Roberts has no specific evidence for his accusati ons. There is circumstantial evidence that Deterding was pro-Nazi. He late r went to live in Hitler's Germany and increased his share of the German petroleum mark et. So there may have been some contributions, but these have not been proven. Similarly, in France (on January 11, 1932), Paul Faur e, a member of the Chambre des Députés, accused the French industrial firm of Schneider-Creuzot of financing Hitler — and incidentally implicated Wall Stre et in other financing channels. 10 The Schneider group is a famous firm of French armaments manufacture rs. After recalling the Schneider influence in establishment of Fascism in Hungary and its extensive international armaments operations , Paul Fauré turns to Hitler, and quotes from the French paper LeJournal, \"that Hitler had received 300,000 Swi ss gold francs\" from subscriptions opened in Holland under the case of a unive rsity professor named von Bissing. The Skoda plant at Pilsen, stated Paul Fa uré, was controlled by the French Schneider family, and it was the Skoda directors von Duschnitz and von Arthab er who made the subscriptions to Hitler. Fauré concluded: . . . I am disturbed to see the direct ors of Skoda, controlled by Schneider, subsidizing the electoral campaign of M. Hitler; I am disturbed to see your firms, your financiers, your industrial ca rtels unite themselves with the most nationalistic of Germans .... Again, no hard evidence was found for th is alleged flow of Hitler funds. Fritz Thyssen and W.A. Harriman Company of New York Another elusive case of reporte d financing of Hitler is that of Fritz Thyssen, the German steel magnate who associated himself with the Nazi moveme nt in the early 20s. When interrogated in 1945 under Project Dustbin, 11 Thyssen recalled that he was approached in 1923 by General Ludendorf at the time of French evacuation of the Ruhr . Shortly after this meeting Thyssen was introduced to Hitler and provided funds for the Nazis through General Ludendorf. In 1930-1931 Emil Kirdorf approach ed Thyssen and subse quently sent Rudolf Hess to negotiate further funding for the Nazi Party. This time Thyssen arranged a credit of 250,000 marks at the Bank Voor Handel en Sc heepvaart N.V. at 18 Zuidblaak in Rotterdam, Holland, founded in 1918 with H.J. Kouwenhoven and D.C. Schutte as managing partners. 12 This bank was a subsidiary of th e August Thyssen Bank of Germany (formerly von der Heydt's Bank A.G.). It wa s Thyssen's personal banking operation, and it was affiliated with the W. A. Harriman financial interests in New York. Thyssen reported to his Project Dustbin interrogators that: I chose a Dutch bank because I did not want to be mixed u p with German"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"banks in my position, and beca use I thought it was better to do business with a Dutch bank, and I thought I would have the Nazis a little more in my hands. 13 Thyssen's book I Paid Hitler, published in 1941, was purported to be writte n by Fritz Thyssen himself, although Thyssen denies author ship. The book claims that funds for Hitler — about one million marks — came mainly from Thyssen himself. I Paid Hitler has other unsupported assertions, for exampl e that Hitler was actually de scended from an illegitimate child of the Rothschild famil y. Supposedly Hitler's grandmother, Frau Schickelgruber, had been a servant in the Rothschild hous ehold and while there became pregnant: ... an inquiry once ordered by the late Au strian chancellor, Engelbert Dollfuss, yielded some interesting resu lts, owing to the fact that the dossiers of the police department of the Austro-Hungarian m onarch were remarkably complete. 14 This assertion concerning Hitler's illegitimacy is refuted enti rely in a more solidly based book by Eugene Davidson, which implicates the Frankenberger family, not the Rothschild family. In any event, and more relevant from our viewpoint, the August Thyssen front bank in Holland — i.e., the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart N.V. — controlled the Union Banking Corporation in New Yo rk. The Harrimans had a fina ncial interest in, and E. Roland Harriman (Averell's brot her) was a director of, this Union Banking Corporation. The Union Banking Corporation of New York Ci ty was a joint Thyssen-Harriman operation with the following directors in 1932: 15 TABLE 7 - 1: FINANCIAL LINKS BETWEEN U. S.

JAMES Partner Brown Brothers, later Brown Brothers, Harriman & Co."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" Thyssen arranged a credit of 250,000 marks for Hitler, through this Dutch bank affiliated with the Harrimans. Thyssen's book, later repudiated, states that as much as one million marks came from Thyssen. Thyssen's U.S. partners were, of course, pr ominent members of the Wall Street financial establishment. Edward Henry Harriman, the ni neteenth-century railroad magnate, had two sons, W. Averell Harriman (bor n in 1891), and E. Roland Ha rriman (born in 1895). In 1917 W. Averell Harriman was a director of Guaranty Trust Co mpany and he was involved in the Bolshevik Revolution. 16 According to his biographer, Aver ell started at the bottom of the career ladder as a clerk and section hand after l eaving Yale in 1913, then \"he moved steadily forward to positions of increasing responsibility in th e fields of transportation and finance. 17 In addition to his directorship in Guaran ty Trust, Harriman formed the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation in 1917, which soon became the la rgest merchant fleet under American flag. This fleet wa s disposed of in 1925 and Harr iman entered the lucrative Russian market. 18 In winding up these Russian d eals in 1929, Averell Harriman recei ved a windfall profit of $1 million from the usually hard-headed Sovi ets, who have a reputation of giving nothing away without some present or later quid pro quo. Concurrently with th ese successful moves in international finance, Averell Harriman ha s always been attracted by so-called \"public\" service. In 1913 Harriman's \"public\" service be gan with an appointment to the Palisades Park Commission. In 1933 Harriman was appoi nted chairman of the New York State Committee of Employment, and in 1934 became Administrative Offi cer of Roosevelt's NRA — the Mussolini-like brainchild of General Electric's Gerard Swope. 19 There followed a stream of \"public\" offices, first the Lend Lease pr ogram, then as Ambassador to the Soviet Union, later as Secretary of Commerce. By contrast, E. Roland Harriman confined his activities to private bus iness in international finance without venturi ng, as did brother Averell, into \"public\" service. In 1922 Roland and Averell formed W. A. Harri-man & Company. Still later Roland beca me chairman of the board of Union Pacific Rail road and a director of Newsweek magazine, Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, a member of the board of governor s of the American Red Cross, and a member of the Amer ican Museum of Natural History. Nazi financier Hendrik Joze f Kouwenhoven, Roland Harriman's fellow-director at Union Banking Corporation in New York, was managing director of the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart N.V. (BHS) of Rotterdam. In 1940 the BHS he ld approximately $2.2 million assets in the Union Banking Corporation, whic h in turn did most of its business with BHS. 20 In the 1930s Kouwenhoven was also a direct or of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G., the steel cartel founded with Wall Street funds in the mid- 1920s. Like Baron Schroder, he was a prominent Hitler supporter. Another director of the New York Union Banking Corporation was Johann Groeninger, a German subject with numerous industrial and financial affili ations involving Vereinigte Stahlwerke, the August Thysse n group, and a directorship of August Thyssen Hutte A.G. 21 This affiliation and mutual business interest between Harriman and the Thyssen interests does not su gg est that the Harrimans directl y financed Hitler. On the other hand, it does"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"show that the Harrimans were intimately connected with promin ent Nazis Kouwenhoven and Groeninger and a Nazi fr ont bank, the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart. There is every reason to believe that th e Harrimans knew of Thyssen's support for the Nazis. In the case of the Harrimans, it is important to bear in mind their long-lasting and intimate relationship with the Soviet Un ion and the Harriman's position at the center of Roosevelt's New Deal and the Democratic Party. The evidence suggests th at some members of the Wall Street elite are connect ed with, and certainly have influence with, all significant political groupings in the contemporary world socialist spectrum — S oviet socialism, Hitler's national socialism, and Roosev elt's New Deal socialism. Financing Hitler in the March 1933 General Election Putting the Georg Bell-Deterding and the Thy ssen-Harriman cases to one side, we now examine the core of Hitler's backing. In Ma y 1932 the so-called \"Kaiserhof Meeting\" took place between Schmitz of I.G. Farben, Max Ilgner of American I.G. Farben, Kiep of Hamburg-America Line, and Di em of the German Potash Trust. More than 500,000 marks was raised at this meeting and deposited to th e credit of Rudolf Hess in the Deutsche Bank. It is noteworthy, in light of the \"Warburg myth\" described in Chapter Ten that Max Ilgner of the American I.G. Farben contributed 100,000 RM, or one-fifth of the total. The \"Sidney Warburg\" book claims Warburg i nvolvement in the funding of Hitler, and Paul Warburg was a director of American I.G. Farben 22 while Max Warburg was a director of I.G. Farben. There exists irrefutable documentary evidence of a further role of. in ternational bankers and industrialists in the financi ng of the Nazi Party and the Volkspartie for the March 1933 German election. A total of three million Reic hmarks was subscribed by prominent firms and businessmen, suitably \"was hed\" through an account at th e Delbruck Schickler Bank, and then passed into the hands of Rudolf He ss for use by Hitler and the NSDAP. This transfer of funds was followed by the Reichstag fire, abrogation of constitutional rights, and consolidation of Nazi power. Access to the Re ichstag by the arsonist s was obtained through a tunnel from a house where Putz i Hanfstaengel was staying; th e Reichstag fire itself was used by Hitler as a pretext to abolish constitutional rights. In brief, within a few weeks of the major funding of Hitler there was a linke d sequence of major events: the financial contribution from prominent ba nkers and industrialists to the 1933 election, burning of the Reichstag, abrogation of constitu tional rights, and subsequent seizure of power by the Nazi Party. The fund-raising meeting was held February 20, 1933 in th e home of Goering, who was then president of the Reichstag, with Hjal mar Horace Greeley Schacht acting as host. Among those present, according to I.G. Farben's von Schnitzler, were: Krupp von Bohlen, who, in the begi nning of 1933, was president of the Reichsverband der Deutschen Industrie Re ich Association of German Industry; Dr. Albert Voegler, the leading man of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke; Von Loewenfeld; Dr, Stein, head of the Ge werkschaft Auguste-Victoria, a mine which belongs to the IG. 23 Hitler expounded his political views to the assembled businessmen in a lengthy two-and- one-half hour speech, using the threat of Communism and a Co mmunist take-over to great effect:"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"It is not enough to say we do not want Communism in our economy. If we continue on our old political course, then we shall perish .... It is the noblest task of the leader to find ideals that are stronger than the factors that pull the people together. I recognized even while in the hospital that one had to search for new ideals conducive to reconstruction. I found them in nationalism, in the value of personality, and in the denial of reconciliation between nations .... Now we stand before the last election. Re gardless of the outco me, there will be no retreat, even if the coming electi on does not bring about decision, one way or another. If the electi on does not decide, the deci sion must be brought about by other means. I have inte rvened in order to give the people once more the chance to decide their fate by themselves .... There are only two possibilities, ei ther to crowd back the opponent on constitutional grounds, and for this purpos e once more this election; or a struggle will be conducte d with other weapons, wh ich may demand greater sacrifices. I hope the German people th us recognize the greatness of the hour. 24 After Hitler had spoken, Krupp von Bohlen expressed the support of the assembled industrialists and bankers in th e concrete form of a three-mi llion-mark political fund. It turned out to be more than enough to acquire power, because 600,000 marks remained unexpended after the election. Hjalmar Schacht organized this historic meet ing. We have previously described Schacht's links with the United States: his father was cashier for the Berlin Branch of Equitable Assurance, and Hjalmar was intimately involved almost on a monthly basis with Wall Street. The largest contributor to the fund was I.G. Farben, which como mitted itself for 80 percent (or 500,000 marks) of the total. Director A. Steinke, of BUBIAG (Braunkohlen-u. Brikett- Industrie A.G.), an I.G. Farben subsidiar y, personally contributed another 200,000 marks. In brief, 45 percent of the funds for the 1933 election came from I.G. Fa rben. If we look at the directors of American I.G. Farb en — the U.S. subsidiary of I. G. Farben — we get close to the roots of Wall Street involveme nt with Hitler. The board of Am erican I.G. Farben at this time contained some of the most prestigious names among American i ndustrialists: Edsel B. Ford of the Ford Motor Compa ny, C.E. Mitchell of the Fede ral Reserve Bank of New York, and Walter Teagle, dir ector of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, and President Frankl in D. Roosevelt's Georgia Warm Springs Foundation. Paul M. Warburg, first director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and chairman of the Bank of Manhattan, was a Farben director and in Germany his brother Max Warburg was also a director of I.G, Farben. H. A. Metz of I.G. Farben was also a director of the Warburg's Bank of Manhattan. Fi nally, Carl Bosch of American I.G. Farben was also a director of Ford Motor Company A-G in Germany. Three board members of American I.G. Farb en were found guilty at the Nuremburg War Crimes Trials: Max Il gner, F. Ter Meer, and Hermann Sc hmitz. As we have noted, the American board members — Edsel Fo rd, C. E.

Usually the blame for financing Hitler has been excl usively placed upon Fritz Thysse n or Emil Kirdorf. In the case of Thyssen this blame wa s widely circulated in a book allegedly authored by Thyssen in the middle of World War II but later repudiated by him. 27 Why Thyssen would want to admit such actions before the de feat of Naziism is unexplained. Emil Kirdorf, who died in 1937, was always proud of his association with the rise of Naziism. The attempt to limit Hitler financ ing to Thyssen and Kirdorf extended into the Nuremburg trials in 1946, and was challenged onl y by the Soviet delegate. Even the Soviet delegate was unwilli ng to produce evidence of American asso ciations; this is not surprising because the Soviet Union depends on the goodwill of these same financiers to transfer much needed advanced Western technology to the U.S.S.R. At Nuremburg, statements were made and allowed to go uncha llenged which were directly contrary to the known direct evidence presented above. For example, Buecher, Director General of German General Electric, was absolved from sympathy for Hitler: Thyssen has confessed his error like a man and has courageously paid a heavy penalty for it. On the other si de stand men like Reusch of the Gutehoffnungshuette, Karl Bosch, the la te chairman of the I.G. Farben Aufsichtsrat, who would very likely have come to a sad end, had he not died in time. Their feelings were shared by th e deputy chairman of the Aufsichtsrat of Kalle. The Siemens and AEG companies which, next to I.G. Farben, were the most powerful German concerns, and th ey were determined opponents of national socialism. I know that this unfriendl y attitude on the part of the Siemens concern to the Nazis resulted in the firm receiving rather rough treatment. The Director General of the AEG (Allgemeine Elektrizitats Gesellschaft), Geheimrat Buecher, whom I knew from my stay in the colonies, was anything but a Nazi. I can assure General Taylor that it is certainly wrong to assert that the leading industrialists as such favored Hitl er before his seizure of power. 28 Yet on page 56 of this book we reproduce a doc ument originating with General Electric, transferring General Electric f unds to the National Trusteeshi p account controlled by Rudolf Hess on behalf of Hitler a nd used in the 1933 elections."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Similarly, von Schnitzler, who was present at the February 1933 meeting on behalf of I.G. Farben, denied I.G. Farben's contri butions to the 1933 Nationale Treuhand: I never heard again of the w hole matter [that of financi ng Hitler], but I believe that either the buro of Goering or Sc hacht or the Reichs verband der Deutschen Industrie had asked the of fice of Bosch or Schmitz for payment of IG's share in the elec tion fund. As I did not take the matter up again I not even at that time knew whether and which amount had been paid by the IG. According to the volume of the IG, I should estimate IG 's share being some thing like 10 percent of the election fund, but as far as I know there is no evidence that I.G. Farben participated in the payments. 29 As we have seen, the evidence is incontrovert ible regarding political cash contributions to Hitler at the crucial point of the takeover of power in Germany — and Hitler's earlier speech to the industrialists clea rly revealed that a coercive takeover was the premeditated intent. We know exactly who contributed , how much, and through what ch annels. It is notable that the largest contributors — I.G. Farben, German General Electric (and its affiliated company Osram), and Thyssen — were af filiated with Wall Street fina nciers. These Wall Street financiers were at the heart of the financial elite and they we re prominent in contemporary American politics. Gerard Swope of General Electric was author of Roosevelt's New Deal, Teagle was one of NRA's top administrators, Paul Warburg and his associates at American I.G. Farben were Roosevelt advisors. It is perhaps not an extraordinary coincidence that Roosevelt's New Deal — called a \"fascist m easure\" by Herbert Hoove r — should have so closely resembled Hitler's pr ogram for Germany, and that bot h Hitler and Roosevelt took power in the same month of the same year — March 1933.

Putzi's student day friends at Harvard University were \"such outstanding future figures\" as Walter Lippman, John Reed (who figures prominently in Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution), and Franklin D. Roosevelt. After a few years at Harvard, Putzi established the family art bus iness in New York; it was a delightful combination of busin ess and pleasure, for as he says, \"the famous names who visited me were legion, Pierpont Morgan, Tos canini, Henry Ford, Caruso, Santos-Dumont, Charlie Chaplin, Paderewski, and a daughter of Pr esident Wilson.\" 2 It was also at Harvard that Putzi made friends with the future President Franklin Delano Roosevelt: I took most of my meals at the Harv ard Club, where I made friends with the young Franklin D. Roosevelt, at that time a rising New York State Senator. Also I received several invitations to vi sit his distant cousin Teddy, the former President, who had retired to his estate at Sagamore Hill. 3 From these varied friendships (or perhaps after reading this book and its predecessors, Wall Street and FDR and Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution, the reader may consider Putzi's friendship to have been confined to a peculiarly elitist circle), Putzi became not only an early friend, backer and financier of Hitl er, but among those early Hitler supporters he was, \"., . almost the only person who crossed the lines of his (Hitler's) groups of acquaintances.\" 4 In brief, Putzi was an American citizen at the heart of the Hi tler entourage from the early 1920s to the late 1930s. In 1943, afte r falling out of favor with th e Nazis and interned by the Allies, Putzi was bailed out of the miseries of a Canadian prisoner of war camp by his friend and protector President Franklin D. Roosevelt. When FDR's ac tions threatened to become an internal poli tical problem in the United States, Putzi was re-inter ned in England. As if it is not surprising enough to find both Heinri ch Himmler and Franklin D. Roosevelt prominent in Putzi's life, we also discover th at the Nazi Stormtrooper marching songs were composed by Hanfstaengl, \"incl uding the one that was played by the brownshirt columns as they marched through the Brandenburger Tor on the day Hitler took over power. 5 To top this eye-opener, Putzi averred that the genesis of the Nazi chant \"Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil,\" used in the Nazi mass rallies, was none other th an \"Harvard, Harvard, Harvard, rah, rah, rah.\""},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Putzi certainly helped finance th e first Nazi daily press, the Volkische Beobachter. Whether he saved Hitler's life from the Communists is less verifi able, and while kept out of the actual writing process of Mein Kampf — much to his disgust — Putz i did have the honor to finance its publication, \"and th e fact that Hitler found a f unctioning staff when he was released from jail was entirely due to our efforts. ,\" 7 When Hitler came to power in March 1933, simultaneously with Franklin Delano Roosevelt in Washington, a private \"emissary\" was sent from Roosevelt in Washington, D.C. to Hanfstaengl in Berlin, with a me ssage to the effect that as it appeared Hitl er would soon achieve power in Germany, Roosev elt hoped, in view of their l ong acquaintance, that Putzi would do his best to prevent any rashness and hot-headedness. \"Think of your piano playing and try and use the soft pedal if thi ngs get too loud,\" was FDR's message. \"If things start getting awkward please get in t ouch with our ambassador at once. 8 Hanfstaengl kept in close touc h with the American Ambassador in Berlin, William E. Dodd — apparently much to his disgust, becau se Putzi's recorded comments on Dodd are distinctly unflattering: In many ways, he [Dodd] was an unsatisfactory representative. He was a modest little Southern hist ory professor, who ran his embassy on a shoestring and was probably trying to save money out of his pay. At a time when it needed a robust millionaire to compete with th e flamboyance of the Nazis, he teetered around self-effacingly as if he were still on his college campus. His mind and his prejudices were small. 9 In point of fact Ambassador Dodd pointedly tried to dec line Roosevelt's Ambassadorial appointment. Dodd had no inheritance and preferred to li ve on his State Department pay rather than political spoils; unlike the pol itician Dodd was partic ular from whom he received money. In any event, Dodd commented equally harshly on Putzi, \" ... he gave money to Hitler in 1923, helped him write Mein Kampf, and was in every way familiar with Hitler's motives ....\" Was Hanfstaengl an agent for the Liberal Establishment in the U.S.? We can probably rule out this possibility because, a ccording to Ladislas Farago, it was Putzi who blew the whistle on top-level British pene tration of the Hitler command. Farago reports that Baron William S. de Ropp had penetrated the highest Nazi echelons in pre- World War II days and Hitler used de Ropp \"... as his confidental consulta nt about Briti sh affairs. 10 De Ropp was suspected as being a double agent only by Putzi. According to Farago: The only person ... who ever suspected him of such duplicity and cautioned the Fuehrer about him was the erratic Putzt Hanfstaengl , the Harvard educated chief of Hitler's office deal ing with the foreign press. As Farago notes, \"Bill de Ropp was playing the game In bo th camps — a double agent at the very top.\" 11 Putzi was equally diligent in warn ing his friends, the Hermann Goerings, about potential spies in their camp. Witness the following extr act from Putzi's memoirs, in which he points the accusing finger of es pionage at the Goerings' gardener.. \"Herman,\" I said one da y , \"I will bet an y mone y that f ellow Greinz is a police"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"spy.\" \"Now really, Putzi,\" Karin [Mrs. Herman Goertng] broke in, \"he's such a nice fellow and he's a wonderful gardene r.\" \"He's doing exactly what a spy ought to do,\" I told her, \"he has made himself indispensable.\" 12 By 1941 Putzi was out of favor with Hitler a nd the Nazis, fled Germany, and was interned in a Canadian prisoner of war camp. With Germ any and the United States now at war Putzi re-calculated the odds and concluded, \"Now I knew for certain th at Germany would be defeated.\" 13 Putzi's release from the POW camp came with the pe rsonal intervention of old friend President Roosevelt: One day a correspondent of the He arst press named Kehoe obtained permission to visit Fort Hens. I managed to have a few words with him in a corner. \"I know your boss well,\" I told him. \"Will you do me a small service?\" Fortunately he recognized my name. I gave him a letter, which he slipped in to his pocket. It was addressed to the American Secretary of State, Cordell Hu ll. A few days later it was on the desk of my Harvard Club friend, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In it I offered to act as a political and psychological warfare adviser in the war against Germany. 14 The response and offer to \"work\" for the Americ an side was accepted. Pu tzi was installed in comfortable surroundings with his son, U.S. Army Sergeant Egon Hanfst aengl, also there as a personal aide. In 1944, under pres sure of a Republican threat to blow the whistle on Roosevelt's favoritism for a fo rmer Nazi, Egon was shipped out to New Guinea and Putzi hustled off to England, where the British promptly interned him for the duration of the war, Roosevelt or no Roosevelt, Putzi's Role in the Reichstag Fire Putzi's friendships and political manipulations may or may not be of any great consequence, but his role in the Reichstag fi re is significant. The firing of the Reichstag on February 27, 1933 is one of the key events of modern times. The fire was used by Adolf Hitler to claim imminent Communist revolution, suspend constitutional rights, and seize totalitarian power. From that point on there was no turning ba ck for Germany; the world was set upon the course to World War II. At the time the firing of the Reichstag was blamed on the Comm unists, but there is little question in historical perspectiv e that the fire was deliberately set by the Nazis to provide an excuse to seize political power. Fritz T hyssen commented in the post-war Dustbin interrogations: When the Reichstag was burned, everyone was sure it had been done by the communists. I later learned in Switzerland that it was all a lie. 15 Schacht states quite emphatically: Nowadays it would be quite clear that this action could not be fastened on the Communist Part y .

This is where Putzi Hanfstaengl come s into the picture. Th e key question is how did this group, bent on arson, ga in access to the Reichstag to do the job? After 8 p.m. only one door in the main building was unlocked and this door was guarded. Just before 9 p.m. a tour of the building by watchmen indicated al l was well; no flammable liquids were noticed and nothing was out of the ordinary in the Sessions Chamber where the fire started. Apparently no one could have gained access to the Reichstag buildi ng after 9 p.m., and no one was seen to enter or leave betw een 9 p.m. and the start of the fire. There was only one way a group with flammable materials could have entered the Reichstag — through a tunnel that ran between the Reic hstag and the Palace of the Reichstag President. Hermann Goering was president of the Reichstag and lived in the Palace, and numerous S.A. and S.S. men were known to be in the Palace. In the words of one author: The use of the underground passage, with all its complications, was possible only to National-Socialists, the advan ce and escape of the incendiary gang was feasible only with the connivance of hi ghly-placed employees of the Reichstag. Every clue, every probability points damningly in one direction, to the conclusion that the burning of the Reichstag was the work of National- Socialists. 17 How does Putzi Hanfstaengl fit into this picture of arson and political intrigue? Putzi — by his own admission — was in the Pa lace room at the other end of the tunnel leading to the Reichstag. And according to The Reichstag Fire Trial, Putzi Hanfstaengl was actually in the Palace itself during the fire: propaganda apparatus stood ready, and the leaders of the Storm Troopers were in their places. With the official bulletins planned in advance, the orders of arrest prepared, Karwahne, Frey and Kr oyer waiting patiently in their cafe, the preparations were complete, the scheme almost perfect. 18 Dimitrov also asserts that: The National-Socialist leade rs, Hitler, Goering and Go ebbels, together with the high National-Socialist officials, Daluege, Hanfstaengl and Albrecht, happened to be present in Berlin on the day of the fire, despit e that the election campaign was at its hi ghest pitch throughout Germ any, six days before the poll. Goering and Goebbels, under oath, furnished contradictory explanations for their \"fortuitous\" presen ce in Berlin with Hitle r on that day. The National- Socialist Hanfstaengl, as Goering's \"gue st,\" was present in the Palace of the Reichstag President, immediately adjacen t to the Reichstag, at the time when the .fire broke out, although his \"hos t\" was not there at that time. 19 "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"According to Nazi Kurt Ludeck e, there once existed a document signed by S.A. Leader Karl Ernst — who supposedly set the fire and wa s later murdered by fellow Nazis — which implicated Goering, Goebbels, and Hanfstaengl in the conspiracy. Roosevelt's New Deal and Hitler's New Order Hjalmar Schacht challenged his post-war Nurem burg interrogators with the observation that Hitler's New Order program was the same as Roosevelt's New Deal program in the United States. The interrogators unde rstandably snorted and rejected the observation. However, a little research suggests that not only are the two programs quite similar in content, but that Germans had no trouble in observing the similari ties. There is in th e Roosevelt Library a small book presented to FDR by Dr. Helmut Magers in December 1933. 20 On the flyleaf of this presentation copy is written the inscription, To the President of the United Stat es, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in profound admiration of his conception of a new economic order and with devotion for his personality. The author, Baden, Germany, November 9, 1933. FDR's reply to this admiration for hi s new economic order was as follows: 21 (Washington) December 19, 1933 My dear Dr. Magers: I want to send you my thanks for the copy of your little book about me and the \"New Deal.\" T hough, as you know, I went to school in Germany and could speak German with cons iderable fluency at one time, I am reading your book not only with great inte rest but because it will help my German. Very sincerely yours, The New Deal or the \" new economic order\" was not a creat ure of classical liberalism. It was a creature of corporate soci alism. Big business as reflected in Wall Street strived for a state order in which they coul d control industry and eliminate competition, and this was the heart of FDR's New Deal. Gene ral Electric, for example, is prominent in both Nazi Germany and the New Deal. German General El ectric was a prominent financier of Hitler and the Nazi Party, and A.E.G. also financed Hitler both dire ctly and indirectly through Osram. International General Electric in New York was a major participant in the ownership and direction of both A.E.G. a nd Osram. Gerard Swope, Owen Young, and A. Baldwin of General Electric in the United St ates were directors of A.E.G. However, the story does not stop at General Electric and financing of Hitler in 1933. In a previous book, Wall Street and the Bo lshevik Revolution, the author identified the role of General Electric in the Bolshevik Revolution and the ge ographic location of American participants as at 120 Broadway, New York Ci ty; the executive offices of General Electric were also at 120 Broa dway. When Franklin Delano Roosev elt was working in Wall Street, his address was also 120 Br oadway. In fact, Georgia War m Springs Foundation, the FDR Foundation, was located at 120 Broadway. The pr ominent financial b acker of an early Roosevelt Wall Street venture from 120 Broadw ay was Gerard Swope of General Electric.

In brief, both Hitler's New Order and Roosevelt's New Deal were backed by the same indus trialists and in content were quite similar — i.e., they were both plans for a corporate state. There were then both corporat e and individual bridges between FDR,s America and Hitler's Germany. The first bridge was th e American I.G. Farben, Americ an affiliate of I.G. Farben, the largest German corporation. On the board of American I.G. sat Paul Warburg, of the Bank of Manhattan and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The second bridge was between International General' Electric, a w holly owned subsidiary of General Electric Company and its partly owned affiliate in Germa ny, A.E.G. Gerard Swope, who formulated FDR's New Deal, was chairman of I.G.E. and on the board of A.E.G. The third \"bridge\" was between Standard Oil of New Jersey a nd Vacuum Oil and its wholly owned German subsidiary, Deutsche-Amerikani sehe Gesellschaft. The chairm an of Standard Oil of New Jersey was Walter Teagle, of the Federal Rese rve Bank of New York. He was a trustee of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Georgia Warm Springs Foundati on and appointed by FDR to a key administrative post in the Na tional Recovery Administration. These corporations were deeply involved in both the promotion of Roosevelt's New Deal and the construction of the military power of Nazi Germany. Putzi Hanf staengl's role in the early days, up to the mid-1930s anyway, was an informal link between the Nazi elite and the White House. After the mid-1930s, when the world was set on the course for war, Putzis importance declined — while American Big Bu siness continued to be represented through such intermediaries as Bar on Kurt von Schroder attorney We strick, and membership in Himmler's Circle of Friends.

BACK "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" CHAPTER NINE Wall Street and the Nazi Inner Circle During the entire period of our bus iness contacts we . had no inkling of Farben's conniving part in Hitler's brutal policies. We offer any help we can give to see that complete tr uth is brought to light and th at rigid justice is done. (F. W. Abrams, Chairman of the Boar d, Standard Oil of New Jersey, 1946.) Adolf Hitler, Hermann Goering, Josef Goebbels, and Heinrich Himmler, the inner group of Naziism, were at the same time heads of minor fiefdoms within the Nazi State. Power groups or political cliques were centered around these Nazi lead ers, more importantly after the late 1930s around Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler, Reic h-Leader of the S.S. (the dreaded Schutzstaffel). The most important of these Nazi inner circles was created by order of the Fuehrer; it was known fi rst as the Keppler Circle and later as Himmler's Circle of Friends. The Keppler Circle originated as a group of German businessmen supporting Hitler 's rise to power before and during 1933. In the mid- 1930s the Keppler Circ le came under the influence and protection of S. S. chief Himmler and the orga nizational control of Cologne banker and prominent Nazi businessman Kurt von Schroder. Schroder, it will be recalled, was head of the J.H. Stein Bank in Germany and affiliated with the L. Henry Schroder Banking Corporation of New York. It is within this innermost of the i nner circles, the very core of Naziism, that we find Wall Street, including Standard Oil of New Jersey and I.T.T., represented from 1933 to as late as 1944. Wilhelm Keppler, founder of the original Ci rcle of Friends, typifies the well-known phenomenon of a politicized businessman — i.e., a businessman who cultivates the political arena rather than the impartial market place for his profits. Such businessmen have been interested In promoting socialist causes, beca use a planned socialist society provides a most lucrative opportunity for contr acts through political influence. Scenting such profitable opportunities, Keppler joined the national socialists and was close to Hitler before 1933. The Circle of Friends grew out of a meeting betwee n Adolf Hitler and Wilhelm Keppler in December 1931. During the course of thei r conversation — this was several years before Hitler be came dictator — the future Fueh rer expressed a wish to have reliable German businessmen available for economic advice when the Nazis took power. \"Try to get a few economic leaders — they need not be Party member s — who will be at our disposal when we come into power. 1 This Keppler undertook to do. In March 1933 Keppler was elected to the Reichs tag and became Hitler 's financial expert. This lasted only briefly. Keppler was repla ced by the infinitely more capable Hjalmar Schacht, and sent to Austria where in 1938 he became Reichs Commissioner, but still able to use his position to acquire c onsiderable power in the Nazi State. Within a few years he captured a string of lucrative directorships in German firm s, including chairman of the b oard of two I.G. Farben subsidiaries: Brau nkohle-Benzin A.G. and Kontinental Oil A.G."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Braunkohle-Benzin was the German exploiter of the Standard Oil of New Jersey technology for production of gasoline from coal. (See Chapter Four.) In brief, Keppler war the chairman of the ve ry firm that utilized American technology for the indispensible synthetic gasoline which enabled the Wehrmacht to go to war in 1939. This is significant because, when linked with other evidence presented in this chapter, it suggests that the profits and control of th ese fundamentally impor tant technologies for German military ends were retained by a small group of international firms and businessmen operating acro ss national borders. Keppler's nephew, Fritz Kranefuss, under his uncle's protection, also gained prominence both as Adjutant to S.S. Chief Heinrich Himmler and as a businessman and political operator. It was Kranefuss' li nk with Himmler which led to the Keppler circ le gradually drawing away from Hitler in the 1930s to come within Himmler's orbit, where in exchange for annual donations to Himmler' s pet S.S. projects Circle memb ers received political favors and not inconsiderable protection from the S.S. Baron Kurt von Schroder was, as we have noted, the I.T.T. representative in Nazi Germany and an early member of the Keppler Circle.

Heinrich Himmler then became a frequent participant in the meetings, and through Himmler, various S.S. officers as well as other businessmen joined the group. This expanded group in time became Himmler's Circ le of Friends, with Himmler acting as protector and expeditor for its members. Consequently, banking and Industria l interest — were heavily repr esented in the inner circle of Naziism, and their pre-1933 fi nancial contributions to Hitl erism which we have earlier enumerated were amply repaid. Of the \"Big Five\" German banks, the Dresdner Bank had the closest connections with the Nazi Party: at least a dozen members of Dresdner Bank's board of directors had high Nazi rank and no fewer than seven Dresdner Bank directors were among Keppler's expanded Circle of Friends, which never exceeded 40. When we examine the names comprising both th e original pre-1933 Keppler Circle and the post-1933 expanded Keppler and H immler's Circle, we find the Wall Street mu lti-nationals heavily represented — more so than any other institutiona l group.

It was the Stein Bank that held th e secrets of the associations of American subsidiaries with Nazi authorities while Wo rld War II was in pr ogress. The New York financial interests could not know the precise na ture of these transact ions (and particularly the nature of any records that may have been kept by their German associates), but they knew that some record could well exist of their war- time dealings — e nough to embarrass them with the American public. It was th is possibility that Colonel Bogdan tried unsuccessfully to head off. German General Electric profited greatly fr om its association wi th Himmler and other leading Nazis. Several members of the Schroder clique were directors of A.E.G., the most prominent being Robert Pferdmenges, who was not only a member of the Keppler or Himmler Circles but was a partner in the aryanized banking house Pferdmenges & Company, the successor to the former Jewi sh banking house Sal Oppenheim of Cologne.

We have shown with original documentary evidence that there was indirect American participation and support through German affiliated firms, and (as for ex ample in the case of I.T.T.) there was a knowledgeable and deliberate effort to benefi t from the support of the Nazi regime. Was this indirect financing exte nded to direct financing? After Hitler gained power, U.S. firms and indi viduals worked on be half of Naziism and certainly profited from the Nazi state. We know from the diarie s of William Dodd, the American Ambassador to Germany, that in 1933 a stream of Wall Street bankers and industrialists filed through the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, expressing their admiration for Adolf Hitler — and anxious to find ways to do business with the new totalitarian regime. For example, on September 1, 1933 Dodd record ed that Henry Mann of the National City Bank and Winthrop W. Aldrich of the Chase Ba nk both met with Hitler and \"these bankers feel they can work with him.\" 1 Ivy Lee, the Rockefeller public relations agent, according to Dodd \"showed himself at once a cap italist and an advoc ate of Fascism.\" 2 So at least we can identify a sympathetic response to the new Nazi dictatorship, reminiscent of the manner in which Wall Street internat ional bankers greeted the new Russia of Lenin and Trotsky in 1917. Who Was \"Sidney Warburg\"? The question posed in this chapter is the accusa tion that some Wall St reet financiers (the Rockefellers and Warburgs spec ifically have been accused) di rectly planned and financed Hitler's takeover in 1933, and that they did this from Wall Street. On this question the so- called myth of \"Sidney Warburg\" is relevant. Prominent Nazi Franz vo n Papen has stated in his Memoirs: 3 ... the most documented acc ount of the National Socialists' sudden acquisition of funds was contained in a book published in Ho lland in 1933, by the old established Amsterdam publishing house of Van Holkema & Warendorf, called De Geldbronnen van Het Nationaal-Socia lisme (Drie Gesprekken Met Hitler) under the name \"Sidney Warburg.\" A book with this title in Dutch by \"Sidney Warburg\" was indeed published in 1933, but remained on the book stalls in Holland onl y for a matter of days. The book was purged. 4 One of three surviving original copies was tr anslated into English. The translation was at one time deposited in the Brit ish Museum, but is now withdr awn from public circulation and is unavailable for resear ch. Nothing is now known of the original Dutch copy upon which this En g lish translation was based."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The second Dutch copy was owned by Chancello r Schussnigg in Austria, and nothing is known of its present whereabout s. The third Dutch copy found its way to Switzerland and was translated into German. The German tran slation has survived dow n to the present day in the Schweizerischen Sozialarchiv in Zu rich, Switzerland. A ce rtified copy of the authenticated German translati on of this Swiss survivor wa s purchased by the author in 1971 and translated into English. It is upon this English translation of the German translation that the text in this chapter is based. Publication of the \"Sidney Warburg\" book was duly reported in the New York Times (November 24, 1933) under the titl e \"Hoax on Nazis Feared.\" A brief article noted that a \"Sidney Warburg\" pamphlet has appeared in Holland, and the au thor is not the son of Felix Warburg. The translator is J. G. Shoup, a Be lgian newspaperman living in Holland. The publishers and Shoup \"are wonderi ng if they have not been the victims of a hoax.\" The Times account adds: The pamphlet repeats an ol d story to the effect that leading Americans, including John D. Rockefelle r, financed Hitler from 1929 to 1932 to the extent of $32,000,000, their motive being\" to liberate Germany from the financial grip of France by bringing about a revolution·\" Many re aders of the pamphlet have pointed out that it cont ains many inaccuracies. Why was the Dutch original withdrawn fr om circulation in 1933? Because \"Sidney Warburg\" did not exis t and a \"Sidney Warbur g\" was claimed as th e author. Since 1933 the \"Sidney Warburg\" book has been promoted by va rious parties both as a forgery and as a genuine document. The Warburg fa mily itself has gone to some pains to substantiate its falsity. What does the book report? What does the boo k claim happened in Ge rmany in the early 1930s? And do these events have any resemblance to facts we know to be true from other evidence? From the viewpoint of research methodology it is much more pr eferable to assume that the \"Sidney Warburg\" book is a forgery, unless we can prove the contrary. This is the procedure we shall adopt. The reader may well ask — then why bother to look closely at a possible forgery? There are at least two goo d reasons, apart from academic curiosity. First, the Warburg claim that the book is a forgery has a curious and vital flaw. The Warburgs deny as false a book th ey admit not to have read t nor even seen. The Warburg denial is limited specifically to non-authorship by a Warburg. This denial is acceptable; but it does not deny or reject the validity of the contents. The denial merely repudiates authorship. Second, we have already id entified I.G. Farben as a key fi nancier and backer of Hitler. We have provided photographic evidence (page 64) of the bank transfer slip for 400,000 marks from I.G. Farben to Hitler's \"Nationale Treuhand\" political slush fund account administered by Rudolf Hess. Now it is probable, almost certain, that \"S idney Warburg\" did not exist. On the other hand, it is a matter of public record that the Warburgs were closely connected with I.G. Farben in Germany and the United Stat es. In Germany Max Warbur g was a director of I.G. Farben and in the United States brothe r Paul Warburg (father of James Paul Warburg) was a director of American I.G. Farben. In br ief, we have incontrovertible evidence that"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"some Warburgs, including the father of James Paul, the denouncer of the \"Sidney Warburg\" book, were directors of I.G. Farben. And I.G. Farb en is known to have financed Hitler. \"Sidney Warburg\" was a myth, but I.G. Farben directors Max Warburg and Paul Warburg were not myths. This is reason enough to push further. Let us first summarize the book which Jame s Paul Warburg claims is a forgery. A Synopsis of the Suppre ssed \"Sidney Warburg\" Book The Financial Sources of National Socialism opens with an allege d conversation between \"Sidney Warburg\" and joint author/translator I. G. Shoup. \"Warburg\" relates why he was handing Shoup an English language manuscript fo r translation into Dutch and publication in Holland In the words of the mythical \"Sidney Warburg\": There are moments when I want to turn away from a world of such intrigue, trickery, swindling and tampering with the stock exchange .... Do you know what I can never under stand? How it is possible that people of good and honest character — for which I have am ple proof — participate in swindling and fraud, knowing full well that it will affect thousands. Shoup then describes \"Sidney Warburg\" as \"son of one of the largest ba nkers in the United States, member of the banking firm Kuhn, Loeb & Co., New York.\" \"S idney Warburg\" then tells Shoup that he (\"Warburg\" ) wants to record for histor y how national socialism was financed by New York financiers. The first section of the book is entitled simply \"1929.\" It relates that in 1929 Wall Street had enormous credits outstanding in Germany and Austria, and that these claims had, for the most part, been frozen. While France wa s economically weak a nd feared Germany, France was also getting th e \"lion's share\" of re parations funds which were actually financed from the United States. In June 1929, a meeting took place between the members of the Federal Reserve Bank and leading American ba nkers to decide what to do about France, and particularly to cheek her call on German reparations . This meeting was attended (according to the \"Warburg\" book) by the di rectors of Guaranty Trust Company, the \"Presidents\" of the Federal Re serve Banks, in addition to fi ve independent bankers, \"young Rockefeller,\" and Glean from Royal Dutch Shel l. Carter and Rockefel ler according to the text \"dominated the proceedings. The ot hers listened and nodded their heads.\" The general consensus at the bankers' meeting was that the only way to free Germany from French financial clutches wa s by revolution, either Communist or German Nationalist. At an earlier meeting it had previous ly been agreed to contact Hitl er to \"try to find out if he were amenable to American financial s upport.\" Now Rockefeller reportedly had more recently seen a German -American leaflet about the Hitler national socialis t movement and the purpose of this second meeting was to dete rmine if \"Sidney Warbur g\" was prepared to go to Germany as a courier to make personal contact with Hitler. In return for proferred financial support, Hitler would be expected to conduct an \"aggressive foreign policy and stir up the idea of revenge against Fran ce.\" This policy, it was anticipated, would result in a Fr ench appeal to the United Stat es and England for assistance in \"international q uestions involvin g the eventual German a gg ression.\" Hitler was not to"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"know about the purpose of Wall Street's assistan ce. It would be left \" to his reason and resourcefulness to discover the motives be hind the proposal.\" \"Warburg\" accepted the proposed mission and left New York for Cherbourg on the Ile de France, \"with a diplomatic passport and letters of recomm endation from Carter, Tommy Walker, Rockefeller, Glean and Herbert Hoover.\" Apparently, \"Sidney Warburg\" had some difficul ty in meeting Hitler. The American Consul in Munich did not succeed in making contact with the Nazis, a nd finally Warburg went directly to Mayor Deutzber g of Munich, \"with a recommendation from the American Consul,\" and a plea to guide Warburg to Hitler. Shoup then pres ents extracts from Hitler's statements at this initial m eeting. These extracts include th e usual Hitlerian anti-Semitic rantings, and it should be noted that all the anti, Semitic parts in the \"Sidney Warburg\" book are spoken by Hitler. (This is important b ecause James Paul Warbur g claims the Shoup book is totally anti-Semitic.) Fundi ng of the Nazis was discussed at this meeting and Hitler is reported to insist that funds could not be deposited in a German ba nk but only in a foreign bank at his disposal. Hitler asked for 100 million marks and suggested that \"Sidney Warburg\" report on the Wall Street reacti on through von Heydt at Lutzowufer, 18 Berlin. 5 After reporting back to Wall Street, Warburg le arned that $24 million was too much for the American bankers; they offered $10 milli on. Warburg contacted von Heydt and a further meeting was arranged, this time with an \"undistinguished looking man, introduced to me under the name Frey.\" Instruc tions were given to make $10 million available at the Mendelsohn & Co. Bank in Amsterdam, Holl and. Warburg was to ask the Mendelsohn Bank to make out checks in marks payable to named Nazis in ten German cities. Subsequently, Warburg travelled to Amsterda m, completed his mission with Mendelsohn & Co., then went to Southa mpton, England and took the Olympia back to New York where he reported to Carter at Guaranty Trust Compa ny. Two days later Warbur g gave his report to the entire Wall Street group, but \"this time an English represen tative was there sitting next to Glean from Royal Dutch, a man named Angell , one of the heads of the Asiatic Petroleum Co.\" Warburg was questioned about Hitler, and \"Rockefeller showed unusual interest in Hitler's statements about the Communists.\" A few weeks after Warburg's return from Eur ope the Hearst newspapers showed \"unusual interest\" in the new German Nazi Party and even the New York Times carried regular short reports of Hitler's speeches. Previously these newspapers had not shown too much interest, but that now changed. 6 Also, in December 1929 a long study of the German National Socialist movement appeared \"in a monthly publication at Harvard University.\" Part II of the suppressed \"Fin ancial Sources of National Soci alism\" is entitled \"1931\" and opens with a discussion of French influence on international politics. It avers that Herbert Hoover promised Pierre Laval of France not to resolve the debt question without first consulting the French government and [writes Shoup]: When Wall Street found out about this Hoover lost the re spect of this circle at one blow. Even the subseque nt elections were affect ed — many believed that Hoover's failure to get reelected can be traced back to the issue. 7 In October 19 3 1, Warburg received a letter from Hi tler which he passed on to Carter at Guaranty Trust Company, and subsequently another bankers' meetin g was called at the Guarant y Trust Com p an y of-rices. O p inions at this meetin g were divided. \"Sidne y"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Warburg\" reported that Rockefel ler, Carter, and McBean were for Hitler, while the other financiers were uncertain. Montague Norman of the Bank of England and Glean of Royal Dutch Shell argued that the $10 million already spent on Hitler was too much, that Hitler would never act. The meeting fi nally agreed in principle to assist Hitler further, and Warburg again undertook a courier assi gnment and went back to Germany. On this trip Warburg reportedly discussed Ge rman affairs with \"a Jewish banker\" in Hamburg, with an industrial magnate, and ot her Hitler supporters. One meeting was with banker von Heydt and a \"Luetgebrunn.\" The latter stated that th e Nazi storm troopers were incompletely equipped and the S.S. badly needed machine guns, revolvers, and carbines. In the next Warburg-Hitler meeting, Hitler argued that \"t he Soviets cannot miss our industrial products yet. We will give credit, and if I am not ab le to deflate France myself, then the Soviets will help me.\" Hitler said he had two plans for takeover in Germany: (a) the revolution plan, and (b), the legal takeover pla n. The first plan would be a matter of three months, the second plan a matter of three years. Hitler wa s quoted as saying, \"revolution costs five hundred million mark s, legal takeover costs two hundred million marks — what will your bankers decide?\" Afte r five days a cable from Guaranty Trust arrived for Warburg and is cited in the book as follows: Suggested amounts are out of the question. We don' t want to and cannot. Explain to man that such a transfer to Europe will shatter financial market. Absolutely unknown on international territory. Expect l ong report, before decision is made. Stay there. Continue invest igation. Persuade man of impossible demands. Don't forget to include in report own opinion of possibilities for future of man. Warburg cabled his report back to New York and three days later received a second cablegram reading: Report received. Prepare to deliver te n, maximum fifteen million dollars. Advise man necessity of aggr ession against foreign danger. The $15 million was accepted for the legal takeover road, not for the revolutionary plan. The money was transferred from Wall Street to Hitler via Wa rburg as follows — $5 million to be paid at Mendelsohn & Company, Amst erdam; $5 million at the Rotterdamsehe Bankvereinigung in Rotterdam; and $5 million at \"Banca Italiana.\" Warburg travelled to each of these banks, where he repor tedly met Heydt, Strasser and Hermann Goering. The groups arra nged for cheeks to be made out to different names in various towns in Germany. In other words, the funds were \"laundered\" in the modern tradition to disguise their Wal l Street origins. In Italy the payment group was reportedly received at the main building of the bank by its president and while wai ting in his office two Italian fascists, Rossi and Bal bo, were introduced to Warburg, He ydt, Strasser, and Goering. Three days after payment, Warburg returned to New York from Genoa on the Savoya. Again, he reported to Carter, Rock efeller, and the other bankers. The third section of \"Financial Sources of National Soeialism\" is entitled simply \"1933.\" The section records \"Sidney Warburg's\" third an d last meeting with Hitler — on the night the Reichsta g was burned. ( We noted in Cha p ter Ei g ht the p resence of Roosevelt's friend"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Putzi Hanfstaengl in the Reichstag.) At this meeting Hitler informed Warburg of Nazi progress towards legal takeover. Since 1931 the Nationalist Socialist party had tripled in size. Massive deposits of weapons had been made near the German border in Belgium, Holland, and Austria — but these weapons require d cash payments before delivery. Hitler asked for a minimum of 100 million marks to ta ke care of the final step in the takeover program. Guaranty Trust wired Warburg offering $7 million at most, to be paid as follows — $2 million to the Renania Joint Stock Company in Dusseldorf (the German branch of Royal Dutch), and $5 million to other banks. Warburg reported this offer to Hitler, who requested the $5 millio n should be sent to the Banca It aliana in Rome and (although the report does not say so) presumably the other $2 million was paid to Dusseldorf. The book concludes with the followin g statement from Warburg: I carried out my assignment st rictly down to the last deta il. Hitler is dictator of the largest European country. The world has now observed him at work for several months. My opinion of him mean s nothing now. His actions will prove if he is bad, which I believe he is. For the sake of the German people I hope in my heart that I am wrong. The world cont inues to suffer under a system that has to bow to a Hitler to keep itself on its feet. Poor world, poor humanity. This is a synopsis of \"Sidney Warburg's\" suppressed book on the financial origins of national socialism in Germany. Some of th e information in the book is now common knowledge — although onl y part was generally known in the early 1930s. It is extraordinary to note that the unknown author had access to informat ion that only surfaced many years later — for example, the identity of the von Heydt bank as a Hitler financial conduit. Why was the book take n off the bookstands and suppre ssed? The stated reason for withdrawal was that \"Sidney Wa rburg\" did not exist, that the book was a forgery, and that the Warburg family claimed it contained anti-Semitic and libelous statements. The information in the book wa s resurrected after World Wa r II and published in other books in an anti-Semitic context which does not exist in the orig inal 1933 book. Two of these post-war books were Rene Sonderegger's Spanischer Sommer and Werner Zimmerman's Liebet Eure Feinde. Most importantly James P. Warburg of New York signed an affidavit in 1949, which was published as an appendix in von Papen's Memoirs. This Warburg affidavit emphatically denied the authenticity of the \"Sidney Warburg\" book and clai med it was a hoax, Unfortunately, James P. Warburg focu ses on the 1947 Sonderegger anti-Semitic book Spanischer Sommer, not the original suppressed \"Sid ney Warburg\" book published in 1933 — where the only anti-Semitism stems from Hitler's alleged statements. In other words, the Warburg affidavit raised fa r more questions than it resolved. We should therefore look at Warburg's 1949 affi davit denying the authenticity of Financial Sources of National Socialism. James Paul Warburg's Affidavit In 1953 Nazi Franz von Papen published his Memoirs. 8 This was the same Franz von Papen who had been active in the United States on be half of German espionage in World War I. In his M emoirs, Franz von Pa p en discusses the q uestion of financin g Hitler and p laces the"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"blame squarely on industrialist Fritz Thyssen and banker Kurt von Sehroder. Papen denies that he (Papen) financed Hitle r, and indeed no credible evid ence has been forthcoming to link von Papen with Hitler's funds (although Zimmerman in Liebert Eure Feinde accuses Papen of donating 14 million marks). In this context von Papen mentions \"Sidney Warburg's\" The Financial Sources of National Socialism, together with the two more recent post-World War II books by Werner Zimmerman and Rene Sonderegger (alias Severin Reinhardt). 9 Papen adds that: James P. Warburg is able to refute th e whole falsificati on in his affidavit .... For my own part I am most grateful to Mr. Warburg for disposing once and for all of this malicious libel. It is almost impossible to refute accusations of this sort by simple negation, and his authoritative denial has enabled me to give body to my own protestations. 10 There are two sections to A ppendix II of Papen's book. First is a statement by James P. Warburg; second is the af fidavit, dated July 15, 1949. The opening paragraph of the statement records that in 1933 the Dutch publishing house of Holkema and Warendorf published De Geldbronnen van Het Na tionaal-Socialisme. Drie Gesprekken Met Hitler, and adds that, This book was allegedly written by \"Sidney Warburg.\" A partner in the Amsterdam firm of Warburg & Co. inform ed James P. War burg of the book and Holkema and Warendorf were informed that no such person as \"Sidney Warburg\" existed. They thereupon wi thdrew the book from circulation. James Warburg then makes two sequential a nd seemingly contradictory statements: ... the book contained a mass of libelous material against various members of my family and against a number of pr ominent banking houses and individuals in New York· I have never to this day seen a copy of the book. Apparently only a handful of copies escaped the publisher's withdrawal. Now on the one hand Warburg clai ms he has never seen a c opy of the \"Sidney Warburg\" book, and on the other hand says it is \"libelous\" and proceeds to construct a detailed affidavit on a sentence by sentence basis to re fute the information supposedly in a book he claims not to have seen! It is very difficult to accept the va lidity of Warburg's claim he has \"never to this day seen a copy of the book.\" Or if indeed he had not, then the affidavit is worthless. James Warburg adds that the \"Sidney Warburg \" book is \"obvious anti-Semitism,\" and the thrust of Warburg's statement is that the \"Sidney Warburg\" story is pure anti-Semitic propaganda. In fact (and Warburg would have disc overed this fact if he had read the book), the only anti-Semitic statements in the 1933 book are those attributed to Adolf Hitler, whose anti-Semitic feelings are hardly any great disc overy. Apart from Hitler 's ravings there is nothing in the original \"Sidney Warburg\" book remotely connected with anti-Semitism, unless we classify Rockefel ler, Glean, Carter, McBean, etc. as Jewish. In fact, it is notable that not a single Jewish banker is named in the book — except for th e mythical \"Sidney Warburg\" who is a courier, not one of the alleged money givers. Yet we know from an authentic source ( Ambassador Dodd ) that the Jewish banker Eberhard von O pp enheim did"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"indeed give 200,000 marks to Hitler, 11 and it is unlikely \"Si dney Warburg\" would have missed this observation if he was delibera tely purveying false anti-Semitic propaganda. The first page of James War burg's statement concerns the 1933 book. After the first page lames Warburg introduces Rene Sonderegger and another book writt en in 1947. Careful analysis of Warburg's statem ent and affidavit point up that his denials and assertions essentially refer to Sonderegger and not to Sidney Warburg. No w Sonderegger was anti- Semitic and probably was part of a neo-Nazi movement after World War II, but this claim of anti-Semitism cannot be laid to the 1933 boo k — and that is the crux of the question at issue. In brief, James Paul Warburg starts out by claiming to disc uss a book he has never seen but knows to be libelous and anti-Semitic, then without warning shifts the accusation to another book which was certainly anti-Semit ic but was published a decade later. Thus, the Warburg affidavit so thoro ughly confuses the two books that the reader is lead to condemn the mythical\" Sidney Warburg\" along with Sonderegger. 12 Let us look at some of J.P. Warburg's statements: James P. Warburg's Sworn Affidavit New York City, July 15, 1949 Author's Comments on James P. Warburg Affidavit 1. Concerning the wholly false and malicious allegations made by Rene Sonderegger of Zurich, Switzerland, et al., as set forth in the foregoing part of this statement, I, James Paul Warburg, of Greenwich, Connecticut, U.S.A., depose as follows: Note that the affidavit concerns Rene Sonderegger, not the book published by J.G. Shoup in 1933. 2. No such person as \"Sidney Warburg\" existed in New York City in 1933, nor elsewhere, as far as I know, then or at any other time. We can assume that the name \"Sidney Warburg\" is a pseudonym, or used falsely. 3. I never gave any manuscript, diary, notes, cables, or any other documents to any person for translation and publication in Holland, and, specifically, I never gave any such documents to the alleged J.G. Shoup of Antwerp. To the best of my knowledge and recollection I never at any time met any such person. The affidavit conf ines itself to grant of materials \"for translation and publication in Holland.\" 4. The telephone conversation between Roger Baldwin and myself, reported by Sonderegger, never took place at all and is pure invention.

I did go to Germany on business for my own bank, The International Acceptance Bank Inc., of New York, in both 1929 and 1930. On neither of these occasions did I have anything to do with investigating the possible prevention of a Communist revolution in Germany by the promotion of a Nazi counter- revolution. As a matter of recorded fact, my opinion at the time was that there was relatively little danger of a Communist revolution in Germany and a considerable danger of a Nazi seizure of power, I am in a position to prove that, on my return from Germany after the Reichstag elections of 1930, I warned my associates that Hitler would very likely come to power in Germany and that the result would be either a Nazi- dominated Europe or a second world war — perhaps both. This can be corroborated as well as the fact that, as a consequence of my warning, my bank proceeded to reduce its German commitments as rapidly as possible. Note that Warburg, by his own statement, told his banking associates that Hitler would come to power. This claim was made in 1930 — and the Warburgs continued as directors with I.G.

Warburg's affidavit as published in von Papen's Memoirs we are left as much in the dark as ever. There are three important and unanswered questions: (1) why would James P. Warburg claim as a forgery a book he has not read; (2) why does Warburg's affidavit avoi d the key question and divert discussion away from \"Sidney Wa rburg\" to the anti-Semitic S onderegger book published in 1947; and (3) why would James P. Warburg be so insensitive to Jewish su ffering in World War II to publish his affidavit in the Memoirs of Franz von Papen, who was a prominent Nazi at the heart of the Hitler movement since the early days of 1933? Not onl y were the German Warbur g s p ersecuted b y Hitler in 1938, but millions of Jews lost have brought Hitler the last installment of American funds and to have been received by Goering and Goebbels as well as by Hitler himself, I can prove that I was not in Germany at all. I never set foot in Germany after the Nazis had come to power in January 1933. In January and February I was in New York and Washington, working both with my bank and with President-elect Roosevelt on the then-acute banking crisis. After Mr. Roosevelt's inauguration, on March 3, 1933, I was working with him continuously helping to prepare the agenda for the World Economic Conference, to which I was sent as Financial Adviser in early June. This is a matter of public record. evidence for his claims. See Wall Street and FDR, (New York: Arlington House Publishers, 1975), for details of FDR's German associations. 9. The foregoing statements should suffice to demonstrate that the whole \"Sidney Warburg\" myth and the subsequent spurious identification of myself with the non-existent\" Sidney\" are fabrications of malicious falsehood without the slightest foundation in truth. No. James P. Warburg states he has never seen the original \"Sidney Warburg\" book published in Holland in 1933. Therefore his affidavit only applies to the Sonderegger book which is inaccurate. Sidney Warburg may well be a myth, but the association of Max Warburg and Paul Warburg with I.G. Farben and Hitler is not a myth."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"their lives to Nazi ba rbarism. It seems elementary th at anyone who has suffered and was sensitive to the past sufferings of German Jews w ould avoid Nazis, Nazi ism, and neo-Nazi books like the plague. Yet here we have Nazi von Papen acting as a genial literary host to self-described anti-Nazi Ja mes P. Warburg, who apparent ly welcomes the opportunity. Moreover, the Warburgs had ample opportunity to release such an affidavit with wide publicity without utilizing neo-Nazi channels. The reader will profit from pondering this situation. The only logical explanation is that some of the facts in the \"Si dney Warburg\" book are either true, come close to the truth, or are embarrassing to James P. Warbur g. One cannot sa y that Warburg intends to mislead (although this might seem an obvious conclusi on), because businessmen are notoriously illogical writers and reasoners, and there is certainly nothing to exempt Warburg from this categorization. Some Conclusions from the \"Sidney Warburg\" Story \"Sidney Warburg\" never existed; in this sens e the original 1933 book is a work of fiction. However, many of the then-little-known fact s recorded in the book are curate; and the James Warburg affidavit is not aimed at the or iginal boo but rather at an anti-Semitic book circulated over a decade later. Paul Warburg was a director of American I.G. Farben and thus connected with the financing of Hitler. Max Warburg, a direct or of German I.G. Farben , signed — along with Hitler himself — the document which appointed Hjalmar Schacht to the Reichsbank. These verifiable connections between the Warburgs and Hitler suggest the \"Sidney Warburg\" story cannot be abandoned as a total forgery wit hout close examination. Who wrote the 1933 book, and why? I.G. Shoup says the notes were written by a Warburg in England and given to him to translate. The War-burg motive was alleged to be genuine remorse at the amoral behavior of Warburgs and their Wall Street associates. Does this sound like a plausible motive? It has not gone unnoticed that those same Wall Streeters who plot war and revolution are ofte n in their private li ves genuinely decent ci tizens; it is not beyond the realm of reason that one of them had a change of heart or a heavy conscience. But this is not proven. If the book was a forgery, then by whom was it written? James War-bur g admits he does not know the answer, and he writes : \"The original purpose of th e forgery remains somewhat obscure even today. 13 Would any government forge the document? Cert ainly not the British or U.S. governments, which are both indirectly im plicated by the book. Certainly not the Nazi government in Germany, although James Warburg appears to sugge st this unlikely possibility. Could it be France, or the Soviet Union, or perhaps Austri a? France, possibly becau se France feared the rise of Nazi Germany. Austria is a similar possibili ty. The Soviet Uni on is a possibility because the Soviets also had mu ch to fear from Hitler. So it is plausible that France, Austria, or the Soviet Union had some hand in the preparation of the book. Any private citizen w ho forged such a book without insi de government materials would have to be remarkabl y well informed. Guarant y Trust is not a p articularl y well-known bank"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"outside New York, yet there is an extraordinary degree of plausibility about the involvement of Guaranty Trust, because it was the Morgan vehicle used fo r financing and infiltrating the Bolshevik revolution. 14 Whoever named Guaranty Trust as the vehicle for funding Hitler either knew a great deal more than the man in the street, or had authentic government information. What would be the motive behind such a book? The only motive that seems ac ceptable is that the unknown author had knowledge a war was in preparation and hoped for a public reaction against the Wal l Street fanatics and their industrialist friends in Germany — before it was too late. Clearly, whoever wrote the book, his motive almost certai nly was to warn against Hitlerian aggression and to point to its Wall Street source, because the tec hnical assistance of American companies controlled by Wall Street was still needed to build Hitler's war machine. The Standard Oil hydrogenation patents and financing fo r the oil from coal pl ants, the bomb sights, and the other necessary technology had not been fully transferred when the \"Sidne y Warburg\" book was written. Consequently, this could have been a book designed to break the back of Hitler's supporters abroad, to inhibit the planned transfer of U.S. war-making potenti al, and to eliminate financial and diplomatic support of the Nazi state. If this was the goal, it is regrettable that the book failed to achieve any of these purposes. Footnotes: 1 William E.

Letters between Fo rd of France and Ford of the U.S. between 1940 and July 1942 were analyzed by the Foreign Funds Control section of the Treasury Depart ment. Their initial report c oncluded that until mid-1942: (1) the business of the Ford subsidiaries in France substantially increased; (2) their production was solely for the bene fit of the Germans and the countries under its occupation; (3) the Germans have \"shown clearly their wish to protect the Ford interests\" because of the attitude of strict neutrality maintained by Henry Ford and the la te Edsel Ford; and (4) the increased activity of the French Ford subsidiaries on behalf of the Germans received the commendation of the Ford family in America. 1 Similarly, the Rockefeller Chase Bank was accu sed of collaborating with the Nazis in World War II France, while Nelson Rockefeller had a soft job in Washington D.C.: Substantially the same pattern of behavior was pursued by the Paris office of the Chase Bank during German occ upation, An examination of the correspondence between Chase, New York , and Chase, France, from the date of the fall of France to May, 1942 disc loses that: (1) the manager of the Paris office appeased and collaborat ed with the Germans to place the Chase banks in a \"privileged position;\" (2) the Ge rmans held the Chase Bank in a very special esteem — owing to the interna tional activities of our (Chase) head office and the pleasant re lations which the Paris branch has been maintaining with many of their (German) banks an d their (German) local organizations and higher officers; (3)the Paris manager was \"very vigorous in enforcing restrictions against Jewish property, even going so far as to refuse to release funds belonging to Jews in anticipati on that a decree with retroactive provisions prohibiting such release might be published in the near future by the occupying authorities;\" (4)t he New York office desp ite the above information took no direct steps to remove the undesirable manager from the Paris office since it \"might react against our (Chase) interests as we are dealing, not with a theory but with a situation.\" 2 An official report to then-Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau concluded that: These two situations [i.e., Ford and Chase Bank] convince us that it is imperative to investigate immediately on th e spot the activities of subsidiaries o f at least some o f the lar g er American f irms which were operatin g in France"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"during German occupation .... 3 Treasury officials urged that an investigation be started with the French subsidiaries of several American banks — that is, Chase, Morgan, Nationa l City, Guaranty, Bankers Trust, and American Express. Although Chase and Morgan were the on ly two banks to maintain French offices throughout the Nazi occupation, in Septembe r 1944 all the major New York banks were pressing the U.S. Government for permission to re-open pre-war branches. Subsequent Treasury investig ation produced documentary ev idence of collaboration between both Chase Bank and J.P. Morgan with the Nazis in World War II. The recommendation for a full investigati on is cited in full as follows: TREASURY DEPARTMENT INTER-OFFICE COMMUNICATION Date: December 20, 1944 To: Secretary Morgenthau From: Mr. Saxon Examination of the records of the Ch ase Bank, Paris, and of Morgan and Company, France, have progressed only far enough to permit tentative conclusions and the revelation of a few interesting facts: CHASE BANK, PARIS a. Niederman, of Swiss nationality, manager of Chase, Paris, was unquestionably a collaborator; b. The Chase Head Office in New York was informed of Nieder-man's collaborationist policy but took no steps to remove him. Indeed there is ample evidence to show that the Head Offi ce in New York viewed Niederman's good relations with the Germans as an ex cellent means of preserving, unimpaired, the position of the Chase Bank in France; c. The German authoritie s were anxious to keep the Chase open and indeed took exceptional measures to provide sources of revenue; d. The German authorities desired \"to be friends\" with the important American banks because they expected that these banks would be useful after the war as an instrument of German policy in the United States; e. The Chase, Paris showed itself most anxious to please the German authorities in every possible way. For example, the Chase zealously maintained the account of the German Embassy in Pari s, \"as every little thing helps\" (to maintain the excellent relations between Chase and the German authorities); f. The whole objective of the Chase policy and operation was to maintain the position of the bank at any cost. MORGAN AND COMPANY, FRANCE a. Mor g an and Com p an y re g arded itself as a Fren ch bank, and therefore"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"obligated to observe French banking laws and regulations, whether Nazi- inspired or not; and did actually do so; b. Morgan and Company was most anxious to preserve the continuity of its house in France, and, in order to achieve this security, worked out a modus vivendi with the German authorities; c. Morgan and Company had tremendous pr estige with the German authorities, and the Germans boasted of the splendi d cooperation of Morgan and Company; d. Morgan continued its prewar relations with the great French industrial and commercial concerns which were work ing for Germany, including the Renault Works, since confiscated by the French Government, Puegeqt [sic], Citroen, and many others. e. The power of Morgan and Company in France bears no relation to the small financial resources of the firm, and the e nquiry now in progress will be of real value in allowing us for th e first time to study the Mo rgan pattern in Europe and the manner in which Morgan has used its great power; f. Morgan and Company constantly s ought its ends by playing one government against another in the coldest and most unscrupulous manner. Mr. Jefferson Caffery, U.S. Ambassador to France, has been kept informed of the progress of this investigation and at all times gave me full support and encouragement, in principl e and in fact. Indeed, it was Mr. Caffery himself who asked me how the Ford and General Moto rs subsidiaries in France had acted during the occupation, and expressed the de sire that we should look into these companies after the bank investigation was completed. RECOMMENDATION I recommend that this investigati on, which, for unavoi dable reasons, has progressed slowly up to th is time, should now be pr essed urgently and that additional needed personnel be se nt to Paris as soon as possible. 4 The full investigation was neve r undertaken, and no investigat ion has been made of this presumably treasonable activ ity down to the present day. American I.G. in World War II Collaboration between American businessmen a nd Nazis in Axis Europe was paralleled by protection of Nazi interest s in the United St ates. In 1939 American I.G. was renamed General Aniline & Film, with General Dyestuff s acting as its exclusive sales agent in the U.S. These names effectively di sguised the fact that American I.G. (or General Aniline & Film) was an important producer of major wa r materials, including atabrine, magnesium, and synthetic rubber. Restrictiv e agreements with its German parent I.G. Farben reduced American su pp lies of these militar y p roducts durin g World War II."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"An American citizen, Halbach, became president of General Dyestuffs in 1930 and acquired majority control in 1939 from Dietrich A. Schmit z, a director of Amer ican I.G. and brother of Hermann Schmitz, di rector of I.G. Farben in Germa ny and chairman of the board of American I.G. until the outbreak of war in 1939. After Pearl Harbor , the U.S. Treasury blocked Halbach's bank accounts. In June 1942 the Alien Property Custodian seized Halbach's stock in General Dyestuffs and took over the firm as an enemy corporation under the Trading with the Enemy Ac t. Subsequently, the Alien Pr operty Custodian appointed a new board of directors to act as trustee for the duration of the war. These actions were reasonable and usual practice, but when we probe under the surf ace another and quite abnormal story emerges. Between 1942 and 1945 Halbach was nominally a cons ultant to General Dyestuffs. In fact Halbach ran the company, at $82,000 per year, Louis Johnson, former Assistant Secretary of War, was appointed presiden t of General Dyestuffs by the 'U.S. Government, for which he received $75,000 a year. Louis J ohnson attempted to br ing pressure to bear on the U.S. Treasury to unblock Halbach's blocked funds and allow Halbach to develop policies contrary to the intere sts of the U.S., then at war with Germany. The argument used to get Halbach's bank accounts unblocked was that Ha lbach was running the company and that the Government-appointed board of directors \"would have been lost without Mr. Halbach's knowledge.\" During the war Halbach filed suit agains t the Alien Property Custodian, through the Establishment law firm of Sul livan and Cromwell, to oust th e U.S. Government from its control of I.G. Farben companies. Thes e suits were unsuccessful, but Halbach was successful in keeping the Farben cartel agre ements intact throughou t World War II; the Alien Property Custodian never did go into court during World War II on the pending anti- trust suits. Why not? Leo T. Crowley, head of the Alien Property Cu stodian's office, had John Foster Dulles as his a dvisor, and John Foster Dulles was a partner in the above- mentioned Sullivan and Cromwe ll firm, which was acting on beha lf of Halbach in its suit against the Alien Property Custodian. There were other conflict of interest situations we should note. Leo T. Cr owley, the Alien Property Custodian, appointed Victor Emanue l to the boards of both General Aniline & Film and General Dyestuffs. Before the war Vict or Emanuel was director of the J. Schroder Banking Corporation. Schroder, as we have already seen, wa s a prominent financier of Hitler and the Nazi party — and at that very time was a memb er of Himmler's Circle of Friends, making substantial contributi ons to S.S. organizations in Germany. In turn Victor Emanuel appoint ed Leo Crowley head of Standa rd Gas & Electric (controlled by Emanuel) at $75,000 per annum. Th is sum was in addition to Crowley's salary from the Alien Property Custodian and $10,000 a year as head of the U.S. Government Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. By 1945 Jame s E. Markham had replaced Crowley as A.P.C. and was also appointed by Emanuel as a director of St andard Gas at $4,850 per year, in addition to the $10,000 he drew as Alien Property Custodian. The wartime influence of Gene ral Dyestuffs and this cozy government-business coterie on behalf of I.G. Farben is exemplified in the ease of American Cyanamid. Before the war I.G. Farben controlled the drug, chemical, and dye stuffs industries in Mexico. During World War II it was proposed to Washington that American Cyanamid ta ke over this Mexican industry and develop an \"independent\" chemical industry with the old I.G. Farben firms seized b y the Mexican Alien Pro p ert y Custodian."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"As hired hands of Schroder ba nker Victor Emanuel, Crowley and Markham, who were also employees of the U.S. Government, attempted to deal with the question of these I.G. Farben interests in the United Stat es and Mexico. On April 13, 1943 James Markham sent a letter to Secretary of State Cordell Hull objecting to the proposed Cyanamid deal on the grounds it was contrary to the Atlantic Charter and would interfere with the aim of establishing independent firms in Latin America. The Markham positi on was supported by Henry A. Wallace and Attorney General Francis Biddle. The forces aligned against th e Cyanamid deal we re Sterling Drug, Inc. and Winthrop. Both Sterling and Winthrop stood to lose their drug market in Mexico if the Cyanamid deal went through. Also hostile to the Cyanamid deal of course was I.G. Farben's General Aniline and General Dyestuffs, dominated by Victor Eman uel, banker Sehroder's former associate. On the other hand, the State Department a nd the Office of the Coordinator of Inter- American affairs — which happened to be Nelson Rock efeller's wartime baby — supported the proposed Cyanamid deal. The Rockefellers are, of course, also inte rested in the drug and chemical industries in Latin America. In br ief, an American monopoly under influence of Rockefeller would have replaced a Nazi I.G. Farben monopoly. I.G. Farben won this round in Washington, but mo re ominous questions are raised when we look at the bombing of Germany in wartime by the U.S.A.A.F. It has long been rumored, but never proven, that Farben received favored treatment — i. e., that it was not bombed. James Stewart Martin comments as follows on fa vored treatment received by I.G. Farben in the bombing of Germany: Shortly after the armies reached the Rhin e at Cologne, we were driving along the west bank within sight of the undamage d I.G. Farben plant at Leverkusen across the river. Without knowing anything about me or my business he (the jeep driver) began to give me a lecture about I.G. Farb en and to point at the con. trast between the bomb ed-out city of Cologne and the trio of untouched plants on the fringe: the Ford works and the United Rayon works on the west bank, and the Farben works on the east bank.. 5 While this accusation is very much of an ope n question, requiring a gr eat deal of skilled research into the U.S.A.A.F. bombing records, other aspects of favoritism for the Nazis are well recorded. At the end of World War II, Wall Street moved into Germ any through the Control Council to protect their old cartel frie nds and limit the extent to wh ich the denazification fervor would damage old business relationships. General Lucius Cla y, the deputy military governor for Germany, appointed businessmen who opposed denazification to positions of control over the denazification proceeds. William H. Draper of Dill. on, Read, the firm which financed the German cartels back in the 1920s, became General Clay's deputy. Banker William Draper, as Brigad ier General William Draper, put his control team together from businessmen who had re presented American busines s in pre-war Germany. The General Motors representation in-eluded Loui s Douglas, a former director of G.M., and Edward S. Zdunke, a pre-war head of General Motors in Antwerp, appointed to supervise the Engineering Section of the Control Counc il. Peter Hoglund, an expert on German auto industr y , was g iven leave from General Motors. The p ersonnel selection for the Council"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"was undertaken by Colonel Graeme K. Howard — former G,M. representative in Germany and author of a book which \"praises totali tarian practices [and] justifies German aggression .... \" 6 Treasury Secretary Morgenthau was deeply disturbed at the implic ations of this Wall Street monopoly of the fate of Nazi Germany and prep ared a memorandum to present to President Roosevelt. The complete Morgenthau memorandum, dated May 29, 1945, reads as follows: MEMORANDUM May 29, 1945 Lieutenant-General Lucius D. Clay, as Deputy to General Eisenhower, actively runs the American element of the Cont rol Council for Germany. General Clay's three principal advisers on th e Control Council staff are. 1.

Louis Douglas, whom General Clay describes as my personal adviser on economical, financial and governmental ma tters.\" Douglas resigned as Director of the Budget in 1934; and for the fo llowing eight years he attacked the government's fiscal policie s. Since 1940, Douglas has been president of the Mutual Life Insurance Co mpany, and since December 1944, he has been a director of the General Motors Corporation. 3. Brigadier-General William Draper, w ho is the director of the Economics Division of the Control C ouncil. General Draper is a partner of the banking firm of Dillon, Read and Company, Sunday's New York Times contained the announcement of key personnel who have been appointed by General Clay and General Draper to the Economic Division of the Control Council. The appointments include the following: 1. R.J. Wysor is to be in charge of the metallurgical matters. Wysor was president of the Republic Steel Corpora tion from 1937 until a recent date, and prior thereto, he was associated with the Bethlehem Steel, Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation and the Republic Steel Corporation. 2. Edward X. Zdunke is to supervise the engineering section. Prior to the war, Mr. Zdunke was head of General Motors at Antwerp. 3. Philip Gaethke is to be in char ge of mining operations. Gaethke was formerly connected with Anaconda Coppe r and was manager of its smelters and mines in Upper Silesia before the war. 4. Philip P. Clover is to be in charge of handling oil matters. He was formerly a representative of the Socony V acuum Oil Company in Germany. 5. Peter Hoglund is to deal with indus trial production probl ems. Hoglund is on leave from General Motors and is said to be an ex p ert on German p roduction."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"6. Calvin B. Hoover is to be in charge of the Intelligence Group on the Control Council and is also to be a special adviso r to General Draper. In a letter to the Editor of the New York Times on October 9, 1944, Hoover wrote as follows: The publication of Secretary Mo rgenthau's plan for dealing with Germany has disturbed me deep ly ... such a Carthaginian peace would leave a legacy of hate to poi son international relations for generations to come... the void in the economy of Europe which would exist through the destruct ion of all German industry is something which is difficult to contemplate. 7. Laird Bell is to be Chief Counsel of the Economic Divisi on. He is a well- known Chicago lawyer and in May 1944, was elected the president of the Chicago Daily News, after the death of Frank Knox. One of the men who helped General Draper in the selection of personnel for the Economics Division was Colonel Graeme Howard, a vice-president of General Motors, who was in charge of their overseas business and who was a leading representative of General Motors in Germany prior to the war. Howard is the author of a book in which he praises to talitarian practices, justifies German aggression and the Munich policy of a ppeasement, and blames Roosevelt for precipitating the war. So when we examine the Control Council for Germany under General Lucius D. Clay we find that the head of the fi nance division was Louis Douglas , director of the Morgan- controlled General Motors and president of Mutual Life Insurance. (Opel, the General Motors German subsidiary, had been Hitler 's biggest tank producer .) The head of the Control Council's Economics Division was Willia m Draper, a partner in the Dillon, Read firm that had so much to do with building Nazi Germany in the first place. All three men were, not surprisingly in the light of more recent findings, members of the Council on Foreign Relations. Were American Industrialists and Fi nanciers Guilty of War Crimes? The Nuremburg War Crimes Tria ls proposed to select those responsible for World War II preparations and atrocities a nd place them on trial. Whether. such a procedure is morally justifiable is a debatable matter; there is some justification for holding that Nuremburg was a political farce far remove d from legal principle. 7 However, if we assume that there is such legal and moral justification, then su rely any such trial should apply to all, irrespective of nationality. What for example should exempt Fra nklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, but not exempt Adolf Hi tler and Goering? If the offense is preparation for war, and not blind vengeance, then justice should be impartial. The directives prepared by the U.S. Control C ouncil in Germany for the arrest and detention of war criminals refers to \"Nazis\" and \"Nazi sympathizers,\" not \"Ger mans.\" The relevant extracts are as follows: a. You will search out, a rrest, and hold, pending recei pt by you of further instructions as to their dis position, Adolph Hitler, his chie f Nazi associates,"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"other war criminals and all persons who have participated in planning or carrying out Nazi enterprises involving or resulting in atrociti es or war crimes. Then follows a list of the categories of persons to be arrested, including: (8) Nazis and Nazi sympathizers holding important and key pos itions in (a) National and Gau Civic and economic or ganizations; (b ) corporations and other organizations in which the governm ent has a major financial interest; (c) industry, commerce, agriculture, and finan ce; (d) education; (e) the judicial; and (f) the press, publishing houses and other agencies disseminating news and propaganda. Top American industrialists a nd financiers named in this book are covered by the categories listed above. Henry Ford and Edsel Ford resp ectively contributed money to Hitler and profited from German wartim e production. Standard Oil of Ne w Jersey, General Electric, General Motors, and I.T.T. ce rtainly made financ ial or technical c ontributions which comprise prima facie evidence of \"participating in planning or carrying out Nazi enterprises.\" There is, in brief, evidence which suggests: (a) cooperation with the Wehrmacht (Ford Mo tor Company, Chase Bank, Morgan Bank); (b) aid to the Nazi Four Year Plan and eco nomic mobilization for war (Standard Oil of New Jersey); (c) creating and equipping the Nazi war machine (I.T.T.); (d) stockpiling critical materials fo r the Nazis (Ethyl Corporation); (e) weakening the Nazis' potential enemies (American I.G. Farben); and, (f) carrying on of propaganda, intelligence, and espionage (American I.G. Farben and Rockefeller public-rel ations man Ivy Lee). At the very least there is sufficient evidence to de mand a thorough and impartial investigation. However, as we have noted prev iously, these same firms and financiers were prominent in the 1933 election of Roosevelt and consequently had sufficient polit ical pull to squelch threats of investigati on. Extracts from the Morgenthau diary demonstrate that Wall Street political power was suffic ient even to contro l the appointment of officers responsible for the denazification and eventual government of post-war Germany. Did these American firms know of their assistance to Hitler's military machine? According to the firms themselves, emphatically not. They claim innocence of any in tent to aid Hitler's Germany. Witness a telegram se nt by the chairman of the boa rd of Standard Oil of New Jersey to Secretary of War Pa tterson after World War II, when preliminary investigation of Wall Street assistance was under wa y :"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"During the entire period of our bus iness contacts, we had no inkling of Farben's conniving part in Hitler's brutal politics, We offer any help we can give to see that complete truth is brought to light, and that rigid justice is done. F.W. Abrams, Chairman of Board Unfortunately, the evidence presented is c ontrary to Abrams' telegraphed assertions. Standard Oil of New Jersey not only aided Hitler's war machin e, but had knowledge of this assistance. Emil Helfferich, the board chairman of a Standard of New Jersey subsidiary, was a member of the Keppler Circle before Hitler came to power; he c ontinued to give financial contributions to Himmler's Circle as late as 1944. Accordingly, it is not at all difficult to visualize why Nazi industrialists were puzzled by \"investigation\" and assumed at the end of the war that their Wall St reet friends would bail them out and protect them from the wrath of those who had suffered. These attitudes were presented to the Kilgore Committee in 1946: You might also be interested in k nowing, Mr. Chairman, that the top I.G. Farben people and others, when we que stioned them about these activities, were inclined at times to be very in. dignant. Their general attitude and expectation was that the war was over and we ought now to be assisting them in helping to get I.G. Farben and Ge rman industry back on its feet. Some of them have outwardly said that this que stioning and investigation was, in their estimation, only a phenomenon of short durat ion, because as soon as things got a little settled they w ould expect their friends in the United States and in England to be coming over. Their frie nds, so they said, would put a stop to activities such as these in vestigations and would see t hat they got the treatment which they regarded as proper and that as sistance would be given to them to help reestablish their industry. 8 Footnotes: 1 Morgenthau Diary (Germany). 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid. 4 Ibid., pp. 800-2. 5 James Stewart Martin, All Honorable Men, op. cit., p. 75. 6 Morgenthau Diary (Germany), p. 1543.

BACK "},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":" CHAPTER TWELVE Conclusions We have demonstrated with documentary evidence a number of critical associations between Wall Street inte rnational bankers and the rise of Hitler and Naziism in Germany. First: that Wall Street fina nced the German cartels in the mid-1920s which in turn proceeded to bri ng Hitler to power. Second: that the financing for Hitl er and his S.S. street thugs ca me in part from affiliates or subsidiaries of U.S. firms, including Henry Ford in 1922, pa yments by I.G. Farben and General Electric in 1933, followed by the Standard Oil of New Je rsey and I.T.T. subsidiary payments to Heinrich Himmler up to 1944. Third: that U.S. multi-nationals under the co ntrol of Wall Street pr ofited handsomely from Hitler's military construction program in the 1930s and at least until 1942. Fourth: that these same internat ional bankers used political infl uence in the U.S. to cover up their wartime collaboration a nd to do this infiltrated the U.S. Control Commission for Germany. Our evidence for these four major asser tions can be summarized as follows: In Chapter One we presented evidence th at the Dawes and Y oung Plans for German reparations were formulated by Wall Streeters, temporarily wear ing the hats of statesmen, and these loans generated a rain of profits fo r these international bankers. Owen Young of General Electric, Hjalmar Schacht, A. Voegle r, and others intimately connected with Hitler's accession to power had earlier been the negotiators for the U.S. and German sides, respectively. Three Wal l Street houses — Dillon, Read; Ha rris, Forbes; and, National City Company — handled three-quarters of the repa rations loans used to create the German cartel system, including the dominant I.G. Farben and Vereinigte Stahlwerke, which together produced 95 percent of the explosives for the Nazi side in World War II. The central role of I.G. Farben in Hitler's coup d' état was reviewed in Chapter Two. The directors of American I.G. (F arben) were identified as pr ominent American businessmen: Walter Teagle, a dose Roosevelt associate a nd backer and an NRA administrator; banker Paul Warburg (his brother Max Warburg was on the board of I.G. Farben in Germany); and Edsel Ford. Farben contributed 400,000 RM dir ectly to Schacht and Hess for use in the crucial 1933 elections and Farben was subsequently in the forefront of military development in Nazi Germany. A donation of 60,000 RM was made to Hitler by German Genera l Electric (A.E.G.), which had four directors and a 25-30 pe rcent interest held by the U. S. General Electric parent company. This role was described in Chapter Three, and we found th at Gerard Swope, an originator of Roosevelt's New Deal (its National Recovery Administration segment), to g ether with Owen Youn g of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Clark Minor of"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"International General Electric, were the domin ant Wall Streeters in A.E.G. and the most significant single influence. We also found no evidence to indict the Ge rman electrical firm Siemens, which was not under Wall Street control. In contrast, there is documenta ry evidence that both A.E.G. and Osram, the other units of the German elect rical industry — both of which had U.S. participation and control — did finance Hitler. In fact, almo st all director s of German General Electric were Hitler b ackers, either directly through A.E.G. or indirectly through other German firms, G.E. ro unded out its Hitler support by technical cooperation with Krupp, aimed at restricting U.S. development of tungsten carbide, which worked to the detriment of the U.S. in Wo rld War II. We concluded that A.E.G. plants in Germany managed, by a yet unknown maneuver, to avoid bombing by the Allies. An examination of the role of Standard Oil of New Jersey (whi ch was and is controlled by the Rockefeller interests) was undertaken in Chapter Four. Sta ndard Oil apparently did not finance Hitler's acce ssion to power in 1933 (that part of the \"myth of Si dney Warburg\" is not proven). On the other ha nd, payments were made up to 1944 by Standard Oil of New Jersey, to develop synthetic ga soline for war purposes on beha lf of the Nazis and, through its wholly owned subsidiary, to Heinrich Himm ler's S.S. Circle of Friends for political purposes. Standard Oil's role was technical aid to Nazi development of synthetic rubber and gasoline through a U.S. research company under the management control of Standard Oil. The Ethyl Gasoline Company, jointly owned by Standard Oil of New Jersey and General Motors, was instrumental in supplying vital et hyl lead to Nazi Germ any — over the written protests of the U.S. War Depart ment — with the clear knowledge that the ethyl lead was for Nazi military purposes. In Chapter Five we demonstr ated that International Tele phone and Telegraph Company, one of the more notorious multi-nationals, work ed both sides of World War II through Baron Kurt von Schroder, of the Schrode r banking group. I.T.T. also held a 28-percent interest in Focke-Wolfe aircraft, which ma nufactured excellent German fighter planes. We also found that Texaco (Texas Oil Company) was in volved in Nazi endeavors through German attorney Westrick, but dropped its chairman of the board Ri eber when these endeavors were publicized. Henry Ford was an early (1922) Hitler backer and Edsel Ford continued the family tradition in 1942 by encouraging French Ford to prof it from arming the German Wehrmacht, Subsequently, these Ford-produced vehicles were used against American soldiers as they landed in France in 1944. For his early recogniti on of, and timely assi stance to, the Nazis, Henry Ford received a Nazi me dal in 1938. The records of Fren ch Ford suggest Ford Motor received kid glove treatment from the Nazis after 1940. The provable threads of Hitler financing are drawn togeth er in Chapter Seven and answer with precise names and figures the question, who financed Adolf Hitler? This chapter indicts Wall Street and, incident ally, no one else of consequenc e in the United States except the Ford family. The Ford family is not normally associated with Wall St reet but is certainly a part of the \"power elite.\" In earlier chapters we cited several Roosevelt a ssociates, including Teag le of Standard Oil, the Warburg family, and Gerard Swope. In Ch apter Eight the role of Putzi Hanfstaengl, another Roosevelt friend and a pa rticipant in the Reichstag fire , is traced. The composition of the Nazi inner circle durin g World War II, and the financial contributions of Standard Oil"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"of New Jersey and I.T.T. subsidiaries, are tr aced in Chapter Nine. Documentary proof of these monetary contributions is presented. Ku rt yon Schrader is id entified as the key intermediary in this S.S. \"slush fund.\" Finally, in Chapter Ten we reviewed a book suppressed in 1934 and the \"myth of 'Sidney Warburg.'\" The suppressed book accused the Rock efellers, the Warburgs , and the major oil companies of financing Hitler. While th e name \"Sidney Warbur g\" was no doubt an invention, the extraordinary fact remains th at the argument in the suppressed \"Sidney Warburg\" book is remarkably close to the evid ence presented now. It also remains a puzzle why James Paul Warburg, fiftee n years later, would want to attempt, in a rather transparently slipshod manner, to refute th e contents of the \" Warburg\" book, a book he claims not to have se en. It is perhaps even more of a puzzle why Warburg would choose Nazi von Papen's Memoirs as the vehicle to pr esent his refutation. Finally, in Chapter Eleven we examined the ro les of the Morgan and Chase Banks in World War II, specifically their collaboration with the Nazis in France while a major war was raging. In other words, as in our two previous ex aminations of the li nks between New York international bankers and major historical events, we find a pr ovable pattern of subsidy and political manipulation. The Pervasive Influence of International Bankers Looking at the broad array of fa cts presented in the three volumes of the Wall Street series, we find persistent recurrence of the same names: Owen Young, Gerard Swope, Hjalmar Schacht, Bernard Baruch, etc.; the same international banks: J.P. Morgan, Guaranty Trust, Chase Bank; and the same location in New York: usually 120 Broadway. This group of international bankers backed the Bolshevik Revoluti on and subsequently profited from the establishm ent of a Soviet Russia. This group backed Roosevelt and profited from New Deal social ism. This group also backed Hi tler and certainly profited from German armament in the 1930s. When Big Business should have been running its business operations at Ford Motor, Standard of New Jersey, and so on, we find it actively and deeply involved in political upheavals, war, and revolutions in three major countries. The version of history presen ted here is that the financ ial elite knowingly and with premeditation assisted the Bo lshevik Revolution of 1917 in co ncert with German bankers. After profiting handsomely fr om the German hyper-infla tionary distress of 1923, and planning to place the German reparations bur den onto the backs of American investors, Wall Street found it had brought about the 1929 financial crisis. Two men were then backed as leaders for major Western count ries: Franklin D. Roosevelt in the United States and Adol f Hitler in Germany. The Roos evelt New Deal and Hitler's Four Year Plan had grea t similarities. The Roosevelt and Hi tler plans were plans for fascist takeovers of their respective countries. While Roosevelt's NRA failed, due to then-operating constitutional constraints, Hitler's Plan succeeded. Wh y did the Wall Street elite, the internati onal bankers, want Roos evelt and Hitler in"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"power? This is an aspect we have not explored. Accordi ng to the \"myth of 'Sidney Warburg,'\" Wall Street wanted a policy of revenge; that is, it wanted war in Europe between France and Germany. We know ev en from Establishment hist ory that both Hitler and Roosevelt acted out polic ies leading to war. The link-ups between persons and events in this three-book series would require another book. But a single example will perhaps indicate the remarkab le concentration of power within a relatively few organizati ons, and the use of this power. On May 1st, 1918, when the Bolsheviks contro lled only a small frac tion of Russia (and were to come near to losing even that fraction in the summer of 1918), the American League to Aid and Cooperate wi th Russia was organized in Wa shington, D.C. to support the Bolsheviks. This was not a \"Hands off Ru ssia\" type of com mittee formed by the Communist Party U.S.A. or it s allies. It was a committee created by Wall Street with George P. Whalen of Vacuum Oil Company as Treasurer and Coffin and Oudin of General Electric, along with Thompson of the Federal Reserve System, Willar d of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, and assorted socialists. When we look at the rise of Hitler and Naziism we find Vacuum Oil and General Electric well represented. Ambassador Dodd in Germany was struck by the monetary and technical contribution by the Rockefe ller-controlled Vacuum Oil Co mpany in building up military gasoline facilities for the Nazi s. The Ambassador tried to warn Roosevelt. Dodd believed, in his apparent naivet é of world affairs, that Roosevelt w ould intervene, but Roosevelt himself was backed by these same oil interests and Wal ter Teagle of Standard Oil of New Jersey and the NRA was on the board of Roosevelt's Warm Springs Foundation. So, in but one of many examples, we find the Rockefeller-cont rolled Vacuum Oil Company prominently assisting in the creation of Bolshevik Russia, the military build-up of Nazi Germany, and backing Roosevelt's New Deal. Is the United States Rule d by a Dictatorial Elite? Within the last decade or so, certainly si nce the 1960s, a steady flow of literature has presented a thesis that the United States is ruled by a self-perpetuat ing and unelected power elite. Even further, most of th ese books aver that this elite c ontrols, or at the least heavily influences, all foreign and dom estic policy decisions, and that no idea becomes respectable or is published in the United States without the tacit approval, or perhaps lack of disapproval, of this elitist circle. Obviously the very flow of an ti-establishment literature by itse lf testifies that the United States cannot be wholly under the thumb of any single group or elite . On the other hand, anti-establishment literat ure is not fully recogni zed or reasonably disc ussed in academic or media circles. More often than not it consists of a limi ted edition, privately produced, almost hand-to-hand ci rculated. There are some exceptions, true; but not enough to dispute the observation that anti-establishmen t critics do not easily enter normal information/distribution channels. Whereas in the early and mid-1960s , any concept of rule by a cons piratorial elite, or indeed any kind of elite, was reason enough to dismiss the proponent out of hand as a \"nut case,\" the atmos p here for such conce p ts has chan g ed radicall y . The Water g ate affair p robabl y"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"added the final touches to a long-developing environment of skepticism and doubt. We are almost at the point where a nyone who accepts, for example, the Warren Commission report, or believes that that the d ecline and fall of Mr. Nixon did not have some conspiratorial aspects, is suspect. In brief, no one any longer real ly believes the Establishment information process. And there is a wide variety of altern ative presentations of ev ents now available for the curious. Several hundred books, from the full range of th e political and philos ophical spectrum, add bits and pieces of evidence, more hypotheses, and more accusati ons. What was not too long ago a kooky idea, talked about at midnight be hind closed doors, in hushed and almost conspiratorial whispers, is now openly deba ted — not, to be sure , in Establishment newspapers but certainly on non-network radio talk shows, the underground press, and even from time to time in books from re spectable Establishment publishing houses. So let us ask the question again: Is ther e an unelected power elite behind the U.S. Government? A substantive and often-cited source of information is Ca rroll Quigley, Professor of International Relations at Georgetown University, who in 1966 had published a monumental modern history entitled Tragedy and Hope. 1 Quigley's book is apart from others in this revisioni st vein, by virtue of th e fact that it was base d on a two-year study of the internal documents of one of the power cent ers. Quigley traces th e history of the power elite: ... the powers of financial capitalism had another far reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. Quigley also demonstrates th at the Council on Foreign Rela tions, the National Planning Association, and other groups ar e \"semi-secret\" policy-making bodies under the control of this power elite. In the following tabular presentation we have listed five such revisionist books, including Quigley's. Their essential theses and compat ibility with the three volumes of the \"Wall Street\" series are summarized. It is surprising th at in the three major hi storical events noted, Carroll Quigley is not at all c onsistent with the \"Wall Street \" series evidence. Quigley goes a long way to provide evidence for the existence of the power elite, but does not penetrate the operations of the elite. Possibly, the papers used by Quigley had been vetted, and did not in clude documentation on elitist manipulation of such ev ents as the Bolshevik Revoluti on, Hitler's accession to power, and the election of Roosevelt in 1933. More likely, these politic al manipulations may not be recorded at all in the files of the power groups. They may ha ve been unrecorded actions by a small ad hoc segment of the elite. It is noteworthy that the documents used by this author came from government sources , recording the day-to-day actions of Trotsky, Lenin, Roosevelt, Hitler, J.P. Morgan and the various firms and banks involved. On the other hand, such authors as Jules Arch er, Gary Allen, Helen P. Lasell, and William Domhoff, writin g from widel y different p olitical stand p oints 2 are consistent with the \"Wall"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Street\" evidence. These writers present a hypothe sis of a power elite manipulating the U.S. Government. The \"Wall Street\" series demonstrates how this hypothesized \"power elite\" has manipulated specifi c historical events. Obviously any such exercise of unconstraine d and supra-legal power is unconstitutional, even though wrapped in the fabr ic of law-abiding actions. We can therefore legitimately raise the question of the existe nce of a subversive force operati ng to remove constitutionally guaranteed rights. The New York Elite as a Subversive Force Twentieth-century history, as recorded in Establishment textbooks and journals, is inaccurate. It is a history whic h is based solely upon those of ficial documents which various Administrations have seen fit to release for public consumption. Table: IS THE EVIDENCE IN THE \"WA LL STREET\" SERIES CONSISTENT WITH RELATED REVISIONIS T ARGUMENTS PRES ENTED ELSEWHERE? But an accurate history cannot be based on a selective release of documentary archives. Accuracy requires access to all doc uments. In practice, as previously classified documents in the U.S. State Department files, the Br itish Foreign Office, and the German Foreign Ministry archives and other de positories are acquired, a new vers ion of history has emerged; the prevailing Establishment versi on is seen to be, not only in accurate, but de signed to hide a pervasive fabric of deceit and immoral conduct. The center of political power, as authorized by the U.S. Constit ution, is with an elected Congress and an elected President, working wi thin the framework and under the constraints of a Constitution, as interpre ted by an unbiased Supreme C ourt. We have in the past assumed that political power is consequently carefully exercised by the Executive and legislative branch, after due deli beration and assessment of the wishes of the electorate. In fact, nothing could be further from this assumption. The el ectorate has long suspected, but now knows, that political prom ises are worth nothing. Lies are the order of the day for policy implementors. Wars are st arted (and stopped) with no shre d of coherent explanation. Political words have never ma tched political deeds. Why not? Apparently because the center of political power has been elsewhere than with elected and pr esumably responsive representatives in Washingt on, and this power elite has its own objectives, which are inconsistent with those of the public at large. In this three-volume series we ha ve identified for three historical events the seat of political power in the United States — the power behind the scenes, the hidden influence on Washington — as that of the fi nancial establishment in New Yo rk: the private international bankers, more specifically the financial houses of J.P. Morgan, the Rockefeller-controlled Chase Manhattan Bank, a nd in earlier days (b efore amalgamation of their Manhattan Bank with the former Chase Bank), the Warburgs. The United States has, in s p ite of the Constitution and its su pp osed constraints, become a"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"quasi-totalitarian state. While we do not (yet) have. the overt trappings of dictatorship, the concentration camps a nd the knock on the door at midnight, we most certainly do have threats and actions aimed at th e survival of non-Establishment critics, use of the Internal Revenue Service to bring disside nts in line, and manipulation of the Constitution by a court system that is politically subs ervient to the Establishment. It is in the pecuniary interests of the intern ational bankers to centr alize politi cal power — and this centralization can best be achieved within a colle ctivist society, such as socialist Russia, national socialist Germany, or a Fabian socialist United States. There can be no full understandi ng and appreciation of twentiet h-century American politics and foreign policy without the re alization that this financia l elite effectively monopolizes Washington policy. In case after case, newly released documentat ion implicates this elite and confirms this hypothesis. The revisionist versions of the entry of the United States into World Wars I and II, Korea, and Vietnam reveal the in fluence and objectives of this elite. For most of the twentieth ce ntury the Federal Reserve Syst em, particularly the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (which is outsi de the control of Congress, unaudited and uncontrolled, with the power to print money and create credit at will), has exercised a virtual monopoly over the di rection of the American ec onomy. In foreign affairs the Council on Foreign Relations, superficially an innocent foru m for academics, businessmen, and politicians, contains within its shell, perhap s unknown to many of its members, a power center that unilaterally determines U.S. foreign policy. The major objective of this submerged — and obviously subve rsive — foreign. policy is the acquisition of markets and economic power (profits, if you will), for a smal l group of giant mul ti-nationals under the virtual control of a few banking invest ment houses and controlling families. Through foundations controlled by this elite, research by compliant and spineless academics, \"conservatives\" as well as \"liberals, \" has been directed into channels useful for the objectives of the elite esse ntially to maintain this subve rsive and unconstitutional power apparatus. Through publishing houses controlled by this sa me financial elite unwelcome books have been squashed and useful books promoted; fort unately publishing has fe w barriers to entry and is almost atomistically competitive. Through control of a dozen or so major newspapers, run by editors who th ink alike, public information can be almost orchestrated at will. Yesterday, the space program; today, an energy crisis or a campaign for ecology; tomorrow, a war in the Middle East or some other manufactured \"crisis.\" The total result of this manipulation of soci ety by the Establishment elite has been four major wars in sixty years, a crippling national debt, abandonment of the Constitution, suppression of freedom and opport unity, and creation of a vast credibility gulf between the man in the street and Washi ngton, D.C. While the transparen t device of two major parties trumpeting artificial differen ces, circus-like conventions, a nd the cliche of \"bipartisan foreign policy\" no longer carries credibility, and the financial el ite itself recognizes that its policies lack public acceptance, it is obviously prepared to go it alone without even nominal p ublic su pp ort."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"In brief, we now have to consider and de bate whether this New York-based elitist Establishment is a subversive force operating with deliberation and knowledge to suppress the Constitution and a free soci ety. That will be the task ahead in the next decade. The Slowly Emerging Revisionist Truth The arena for this debate an d the basis for our charges of subversion is the evidence provided by the revisionist historian. Slowl y, over decades, book by book , almost line by line, the truth of recent hist ory has emerged as documents ar e released, probe d, analyzed, and set within a more valid historical framework. Let us consider a few exam ples. American entry into World War II was supposedly precipitated, according to the Establishmen t version, by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Revisionists have established that Franklin D. Roosevel t and General Marshall knew of the impending Japanese attack and did nothing to warn the Pe arl Harbor military authorities. The Establishment wanted war with Japan. Subsequently, the Establishment made certain that Congressional investigati on of Pearl Harbor would fit the Roosevelt whitewash. In the words of Percy Greaves, chief research expert for the Republican minority on the Joint Congressional Comm ittee investigatin g Pearl Harbor: The complete facts will never be know n. Most of the so-c alled investigations have been attempts to suppress, misle ad, or confuse those who seek the truth. From the beginning to the end, facts and files have been withheld so as to reveal only those items of information which benefit the administration under investigation. Those seeking the truth are told that other facts or documents cannot be revealed because they are interm ingled in personal diaries, pertain to our relations with foreign countries, or are sworn to contain no information of value. 3 But this was not the first attempt to bring th e United States into war, or the last. The Morgan interests, in concert with Winston Chur chill, tried to bring the U.S. into World War I as early as 1915 and succeeded in doing so in 1917. Colin Thompson's Lusitania implicates President Woodrow Wilson in the sinking of the Lusitania — a horror device to generate a public backlash to draw the United States into war with Germany. Thompson demonstrates that Woodrow Wilson knew four darts beforehand that the Lusitania was carrying six-million rounds of a mmunition plus explosives, a nd therefore, \"passengers who proposed to sail on that vessel were saili ng in violation of statute of this country.\" 4 The British Board of Inqui ry under Lord Mersey was instructed by the British Government \"that it is considered politically expedien t that Captain Turner, the master of the Lusitania, be most prominently blamed for the disaster.\" In retrospect, given Colin Thompson's evidence, th e blame is more fairly to be attributed to President Wilson, \"Colonel\" House, J.P. Morga n, and Winston Churchill; this conspiratorial elite should have been brought to trial for willful negligence, if not treason. It is to Lord Mersey's eternal credit that after performing his \"duty\" under instructions from His Majesty's government, and placing the blame on Captain Turner, he re signed, rejected his fee, and from that date on re fused to handle Britis h government commissions. To his friends Lord Merse y would onl y sa y about the Lusitania case that it was a \"dirt y business.\""},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Then in 1933-4 came the attempt by the Morgan firm to install a fascist dictatorship in the United States. In the words of Jules Ar cher, it was planne d to be a Fascist putsch to take over the government and \"run it under a dictator on behalf of America's bankers and industrialists.\" 5 Again, a single courageous indi vidual emerged — General Smedley Darlington Butler, who blew the whistle on the Wall Street conspiracy. And once again Congress stands out, particularly Congressm en Dickstein and MacCormack, by its gutless refusal to do no more than conduct a token whitewash investigation. Since World War II we have seen the Korean War and the Vietnamese War — meaningless, meandering no-win wars costly in dollars a nd lives, with no othe r major purpose but to generate multibillion-dollar arma ments contracts. Certainly thes e wars were not fought to restrain communism, because for fifty year s the Establishment ha s been nurturing and subsidizing the Soviet Union which supplied armaments to th e other sides in both wars — Korea and Vietnam. So our revisi onist history will show that th e United States directly or indirectly armed both sides in at least Korea and Vietnam. In the assassination of President Kennedy, to take a domestic exampl e, it is difficult to find anyone who today accepts the findings of the Warren Commission — except perhaps the members of that Commission. Yet key evidence is still hidden fr om public eyes for 50 to 75 years. The Watergate affair dem onstrated even to the man in th e street that the White House can be a vicious nest of intrigue and deception. Of all recent history the story of Operation Keelhaul 6 is perhaps the most disgusting. Operation Keelhaul was the forced repatriation of millions of Russians at the orders of President (then General) Dwi ght D. Eisenhower, in direct violation of the Geneva Convention of 1929 and the long-s tanding American tradition of political refuge. Operation Keelhaul, which contravenes al l our ideas of elementary d ecency and individual freedom, was undertaken at the di rect orders of General Eisenhower and, we may now presume, was a part of a long-range program of nurturing co llectivism, whether it be Soviet communism' Hitler's Naziism, or FDR's Ne w Deal. Yet until rece nt publication of documentary evidence by Julius Epstein, anyone who dared to sugge st Eisenhower would be tray millions of innocent individuals for political purposes was viciously and mercilessly attacked. 7 What this revisionist history real ly teaches us is that our will ingness as individua l citizens to surrender political power to an elite has cost the world a pproximately two-hundred-million persons killed from 1820 to 1975. Add to that untold misery the concentration camps, the political prisoners, the suppre ssion and oppression of those w ho try to bring the truth to light. When will it all stop? It will not stop until we act upon one simple axiom: that the power system continues only so long as individuals want it to continue, and it will continue only so long as individuals try to get something for nothing. The da y when a majority of individuals declares or acts as if it wa nts nothing from government, decl ares it will lo ok after its own welfare and interests, then on that day power elites are doo med. The attraction to \"go along\" with power elites is the at traction of something for no thing. That is the bait. The Establishment always offers something for nothing; but the something is taken from someone else, as taxes or plunder, and awarded elsewhere in exchange for political support. Periodic crises and wars are us ed to whip up support for othe r plunder-reward cycles which in effect ti g hten the noose around our individual libertie s. And of course we have hordes of"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"academic sponges, amoral busin essmen, and just plain hangers -on, to act as non-productive recipients for the plunder. Stop the circle of plunder and i mmoral reward and elitist structures collapse. But not until a majority finds the moral courag e and the internal fortitude to reject the something-for- nothing con game and replace it by voluntary associations, voluntary communes, or local rule and decentralized societies, will the killing and the plunder cease.

We demand equality of rights for the German People in its dealings with other nations, and abolition of the P eace Treaties of Versaill es and St. Germain. 3. We demand land and territory (colonies) fo r the nourishment of our people and for settling our superfluous population. 4. None but members of the nation may be citizen s of the State. None but those of German blood, whatever their creed, may be members of the nation. No Jew, therefore, may be a member of the nation. 5. Any one who is not a citizen of the State may live in Germ any only as a guest and must be regarded as being subject to foreign laws. 6.

If it is not possible to nour ish the entire population of the State, foreign nationals (non-c itizens of the State) must be excluded from the Reich. 8. All non-German immigration must be prevented.

All citizens of the St ate shall be equal as regards rights and duties. 10. It must be the first duty of each citizen of the State to work with his mind or with his body. The activities of the individual may not clas h with the interests of the whole, but must proceed within the frame of the co mmunity and be for the general good. We demand therefore: 11, Abolition of incomes unearned by work. ABOLITION OF THE THRALDOM OF INTEREST 12. In view of the enormous sacrifice of life and propert y demanded of a nation by every war, personal enrichment due to a war must be regarded as a crime against the nation.

We demand that the profits from w holesale trade shall be shared out. 15. We demand extensive developm ent of provision for old age. 16. We demand creation and maintenance of a healthy middle class, immediate communalisation of whol esale business premises, and their lease at a cheap rate to small traders, and that extreme consideration shall be shown to all small purveyors to the State, district authorities and smaller localities. 17. We demand land-reform suitab le to our national requireme nts, passing of a law for confiscation without compensation of land for communal purposes; aboliti on of interest on land loans, and prevention of all speculation in land. 18. We demand ruthless prosecution of those whos e activities are injuri ous to the common interest.

We demand that the Roman Law, which serves the materialistic wo rld order, shall be replaced by a legal system for all Germany. 20. With the aim of op ening to every capable and industr ious German the possibility of higher education and of thus obtaining advancement, the St ate must consider a thorough re- construction of our national system of educ ation. The curriculum of all educational establishments must be brought into line with the requirements of practical life.

We demand abolition of a paid army and formation of a national army. 23. We demand legal warfar e against conscious po litical lying and its dissemination in the Press. In order to facili tate creation of a German national Press we demand: (a) that all editors of newspa pers and their assistants, empl oying the German language, must be members of the nation; (b) that special permission from the State shal l be necessary before non-German newspapers may appear. These are not necessarily printed in the German language; (c) that non-Germans shall be prohibited by law from partic ipating financially in or influencing German newspapers, and that the penalty for contra vention of the law shall be suppression of any such newspaper, and immediate deportation of the non-German concerned in it. It must be forbidden to publish papers whic h do not conduce to the national welfare.

We demand liberty for all religious denominations in the State, so far as they are not a danger to it and do not militate against th e moral feelings of the German race. The Party, as such, stands for positive Christianity, but does not bind itself in the matter of creed to any particular confe ssion. It combats the Je wish-materialist spirit within us and without us, and is convinced that our nation can only achieve permanent health from within on the principle: THE COMMON INTEREST BEFORE SELF 25. That all the foregoing may be realised we demand the creat ion of a strong central power of the State. Unquestioned authority of the pol itically centralised Parl iament over the entire Reich and its organisation; and formation of Chambers for classes and occupations for the purpose of carrying out th e general laws promulgated by the Reich in the vari ous States of the confederation.

Webb, President Ethyl Gasoline Corporation, 185 E, 42nd Street, New York City. Dear Mr. Webb: I learned through our Organic Chemicals Di vision today that th e Ethyl Gasoline Corporation has in mind forming a German co mpany with the I.G. to manufacture Ethyl lead in that country. I have just had two weeks in Washington, no inc onsiderable part of which was devoted to criticising the interchanging wi th foreign companies of ch emical knowledge which might have a military value. Such giving of inform ation by an industrial company might have the gravest repercussions on it. The Ethyl Gasoline Corporation would be no exception, in fact, would probably be singled out for special att ack because of the ownership of its stock. It should seem. on the face of it, that the qua ntity of Ethyl lead used for commercial purposes in Germany would be t oo small to go after. It has be en claimed that Germany is secretly arming. Ethyl lead would doubtless be a valuable aid to military aeroplanes. I am writing you this to say that in my opinion under no conditions should you or the Board of Directors of the Ethyl Gasoline Corporat ion disclose any secrets or 'know how' in connection with the manufacture of tetraethyl lead to Germany. I am informed that you will be advised throug h the Dyestuffs Division of the necessity of disclosing the information which you have r eceived from Germany to appropriate War Department officials.

March 16, 1945 11:30 a.m. GROUP MEETING Bretton Woods — I.T. &T. — Reparations Present: Mr. White Mr. Fussell Mr. Feltus Mr. Coe Mr. DuBois Mrs. Klotz H.M., Jr.: Frank, can you boil down this business on I.T.&T.? Mr. Coe: Yes, sir. I.T. &T. by the wa y did transfer or did get $15 million yesterday or a few days ago of their debts in dollars paid to th em by the Spanish Government and that they are allowed to do under our ge neral license, so that's all right. However, it is in part in their representation to us, pa rt of a deal for the sale of the co mpany in Spain, so they are trying thereby to force our hand. Now, the proposition which they have had up over some years in different forms now takes this form. They can get their receivables paid off in dollars, which they say they have not been able to do hitherto — either $15 mill ion now and $10 million or $11 million later. Th ey will sell the company to Spain and take in return $30 million worth of bonds — Span ish Government bonds — which are to be amortized over a number of years and roughly at the rate of $2 million per a nnum, and they are to receive 90% of those exports in order to amortize bonds fa ster, if they are to export it to the United States. H. M. Jr.: Like the match dealer I mentioned in my speech. Mr. Coe: That's right. The Spanish Government. They are willing, they say — they are able to get from the Spanish Government assurances, th at these will not be, that the shares which the Spanish Government intends to resell wi ll not go to anybody on the black list, and so forth. In some negotiations we ha ve had with them over the last few weeks, they have been willing to come further on that. Our hesitation on the matter relate s to two things; First, that you can't trust Franco, and that if they are able — if Franco is able to sell $50 million worth of shares Of this company in Spain in the next period of time, he may very well sell it to pro-German interests. It seems doubtful that he would be able to di spose of it to the Spaniards, so that is the first thing. The se cond thing we can't document too well, but I think it is more p ronounced in m y mind than in the minds of the Forei g n Funds and le g al p eo p le."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"I don't think we can really trust Behn either. Mr. White: I'm sure you can't. Mr. Coe: We have records here of interviews, going far back, th at some of your men had with Behn — Klaus was one — in which Behn sa id that he had had conversations with Goering with the proposition th at Goering was to hold I.T. &T.'s property in Germany, and as you recall, I.T. &T. here did try to purchas e General Aniline and ma ke it an American company thereby and that was part of the deal which Behn told State and our lawyers very frankly he had discussed. He thought it was perfectly all right protecting property: That was before we entered the war, H. M., Jr.: I don't remember that, Mr. Coe: The man in charge of their propertie s now is Westrick w ho you recall came over here and was mixed up with Texaco. They trie d in every way to cook up deals earlier to escape. They are tied up with top German gr oup and etc. On the other hand, Colonel Behn has been used several times as an emissary by the State De partment, and I believe he is personally on very good terms with Stettinius. We have heard from State on this letter saying they have no objections. We proposed to you earlier — the letter which I sent in to you suggesting that you ask State, if in view of our safe haven objectives, they still said yes. I am confident from talking with them on the phone the last day or two, they will write back and say yes, they still think it is a good deal. H. M., Jr.: This is the position I am in. As you ge ntlemen know I am overextended now and I can't go into this thing personally, and I think that we are just going to have to throw the thing in the lap of the State Depa rtment, and if they want to cl ear it, all right. I just haven't got the time or the energy to fight them on that basis. Mr. Coe: Then we ought to license it now. Mr. White: First you ought to get a letter. I agree wi th the Secretary on this point of view that this fellow Behn is not to be trusted ar ound the corner. There is something about this deal that looks suspicious and has been for the last couple of years we have been dealing with him. However, it is one thing to believe that and another thing to defend that before the pressure that will be brought in here that they are trying to deprive this company of the business deal, but I think that wh at we might do is get the Stat e Department on record that in view of a safe haven project they don't think that there is any danger that any of these assets — I would cite some of them, spell the letter out. Get them down on record and even make them a little frightened a nd hold out or they will at leas t have had the record and you will have called their attenti on to these dangers. This fell ow Behn hates our guts anyway. We have been standing between him and deals for 4 years, at least. H. M., Jr.: Follow what White said. Something along that line. \"Dear Mr, Stettinius; I am bothered about these things due to the following fact s, and I would like you to advise me whether we should or should not .... \" Mr. White: \"In view of the danger that German assets may be cl oaked here, the future —\" and let him come back and sa y , \"No,\" and we'll watch him."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Mr. Coe: We said we wanted to give Acheson something Monday.
