[{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"$7.95 THE PLOT TO SEIZE THE WHITE HOUSE BY JULES ARCHER Americans can no longer be shocked by the discovery that information directly affecting their personal freedom is withheld from news media to protect persons with governmental influence. But it still comes as a shocking revelation that in 1933 there was an actual attempt to make a fascist puppet of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Now, more than forty years later, the public still remains ignorant of the story behind THE PLOT TO SEIZE THE WHITE HOUSE. The fact that the plot was a failure and our presen t government is still a democracy, is directly attributable to Major General Smedley Darlington Butler, one of the most remarkable generals in American history. A veteran of 35 years in the Marine Corps and twice a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor, Butler finally decided that \"war is a racket!\" His reputation for patriotism, integrity, and dedicati on to democracy, coup led with his proclivity to speak the truth as he saw it irrespective of official policy, made him a seemingly perfect front for the men who hated Roosevelt. They were people with a determination, if it were impossible to replace the president, to manipulate him through the person of an Americ an Mussolini. Their short-sightedness prevented their realizing that Butler was obviously the wrong choice for the job. Jules Archer quotes testimony from the McCo rmack-Dickstein House Committee on Un-American Activities hearings (including testimony that was subsequently censored from public record) that details how Butler was approached by representatives of the arch-conservative American Liberty League; how they tried to persuade him to lead an army of veterans in demonstration against Roosevelt's silver standard; how Butler qu ickly concluded that the silver standard controversy was being used as a subterfuge to lead American veterans against Washington for truly sinister purposes; and how this hero, patrio t, and Republican democr at, upon uncovering the full dimensions of the conspiracy, determined to go to Washington and blow it wide open. John L. Spivak, a reporter assigned to cover th e committee hearings, calls the story \"one of the most fantastic plots in American history. . . . What was behind the plot was shrouded in a silence which has not been broken to this day. Even a ge neration later, those who are still alive and know all the facts have kept their silence so well that the conspiracy is not even a footnote in American histories. It would be regrettable if historians neglected this episode and future generations of Americans never learned of it.\" Born in New York City, Jules Archer is a graduate of City College of New York. During World War II he served four years in the Pacific with the Army Air Corps and was also a freelance correspondent by order of General MacArthur. He is the author of many books on politic al events and personali- ties, including Mao Tse-tung, The Dictators, Hawks, Doves and the Eagle, The Extremists, and Chou En-lai. Hawthorn Books, Inc.

According to retired Represent ative John W. McCormack, former Speaker of the House, if the late Ma jor General Smedley Butler of the U.S. Marine Corps had not been a stubbor n devotee of democracy, Americans today could conceivably be living unde r an American Mussolini, Hitler, or Franco. An ironic aspect of the conspir acy General Butler unmasked is that few Americans have ever heard about it, or even know anything about the general. As children all of us were taught about the treason of Aaron Burr and Benedict Arnold, whose betrayals we re safely cobwe bbed by the distant past. But school texts that deal with the New Deal are uniquely silent about the powerful Americans who plotted to seize the White House with a private army, hold President Franklin D. Roosevel t prisoner, and get rid of him if he refused to serve as their puppet in a di ctatorship they planned to impose and control. There is strong evidence to suggest that the conspirators may have been too important politically, socially , and economically to be brought to justice after their scheme had b een exposed before the McCormack- Dickstein Committee of the House of Representatives. The largely anti- Roosevelt press of the New Deal era sc otched the story as expeditiously as possible by outright suppression, distorti on, and attempts to ridicule General Butler’s testimony as capricious fantasy. ix"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"x Forward Smedley Butler’s whole life, however, was proof that he was a man of incorruptible character, integrity, and patriotism, with a deserved reputation for bluntly speaking the whole truth at all times, regardless of the consequences. He was named by Th eodore Roosevelt “the outstanding American soldier.” The official Marine Corps record calls him “one of the most colorful officers in the Marine Co rps’ long history” and “one of the two Marines who received two Medals of Honor for separate acts of outstanding heroism.” He was decorated no fewer than twenty times. Former Speaker McCormack told th e author, “In peace or war he was one of the outstanding Americans in our history. I can’t emphasize too strongly the very important part he play ed in exposing the Fascist plot in the early 1930’s backed by and pla nned by persons pos sessing tremendous wealth.” The crucial events of the plot to seize the White House unfolded between July and November, 1933, with hearings before the McCormack- Dickstein Committee begun in New York City on November 20, 1934. On November 26 the committee released a statement detailing the testimony it had heard, and its preliminary findi ngs. On February 15, 1935, the committee submitted to the House of Representatives its final report, verifying completely the te stimony of General Butler. This book may help break some of th e seals of silence that have kept Americans from knowing the truth about that conspiracy. As the first effort to tell the whole story of the plot in sequence and full detail, it may serve as a fresh reminder of Wendell Phillips’s wa rning about the price of liberty.

His violent deep-set eyes surveyed ten thousand faces upturned am ong the lean-tos, shanties, and tents on Anacostia Flats. Bums, riffraff, drifters, and troubl emakers-those were some of the descriptions being applied to the Bonus Army. Many of the ragged veterans who had marched on the Ca pital had been sleepin g in doorways and under bridges, part of the vast army of tw elve million unemployed. Some were the same men who had fought under Smed ley Butler in the Spanish-American War, the Philippines campaign, th e Boxer Rebellion, the Caribbean interventions, the Chinese interventi on of 1927-1928, and World War I. Butler had come to Washington in 1932 at the urging of James Van Zandt, head of the Veterans of Fore ign Wars, to lend moral support to veterans at a crucial mo ment. Congress had just voted down the Patman Bonus Bill to pay veterans the two- billion-dollar bonus promised them in bonus certificates payable in 1945. Bonus Army Commander Walter W. Waters, a former army sergeant, an d other leaders feared that their discouraged followers would now give up and return home. When Waters introduced Smedley Butler to the huge crowd of veterans gathered along the Anacostia River to hear him, he was greeted with an enthusiastic roar of acclai m that echoed through Washington like thunder. They all knew Old Gimlet Ey e, one of the most colorful generals who had ever led troops 3"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"4 The Plot to Seize the White House into battle. He was even more fa mous and popular among rank-and-file leathernecks, doughboys, and bluejackets for the fierce battles he had fought against the American military hierarchy on behalf of the enlisted men. He was also admired, respect ed, and trusted because of his one- man fight to compel Americans to remember their tragic war casualties hidden away in isolated veterans’ hospitals. Smedley Butler was a wiry bantam of a man, shoulders hunched forward as though braced against th e pull of a heavy knapsack, his hawk nose prominent in the leathery face of an adventurer. Silhouetted against a flaming sunset, he made a blazing speech of encouragement in the blunt language that had kept him in hot wa ter with the nation’s highest-ranking admirals and generals, not to men tion Secretaries of State and Navy. “If you don’t hang togeth er, you aren’t worth a damn!” he cried in the famous hoarse rasp that sent a thr ill through every veteran who had heard it before. He reminded them that losi ng battles didn’t mean losing a war. “I ran for the Senate on a bonus ticket,” he said, “a nd got the hell beat out of me.” But he didn’t intend to stop fighting for the bonus, and neither should they, he demanded, no matter how stiff the opposition or the names they were called. “They may be calling you tramps now ,” he roared, “but in 1917 they didn’t call you bums! ... You are the be st-behaved group of men in this country today. I consider it an honor to be asked to speak to you. ... Some folks say I am here after some thing. That’s a lie. I don’t want anything.” All he wanted, he told th e cheering veterans, was to see that the country they had served dealt w ith them justly. He concluded his exhortation by urging, “When you get hom e, go to the polls in November and lick the hell out of those who ar e against you. You know who they are. ... No go to it!” Afterward he was mobbed by veterans eager to speak to him. Until 2:30 A.M. he sat sprawled on the gr ound in front of his tent, listening sympathetically to tales of lost jobs, families in distress, and troublesome old wounds. He slept three hours, then woke up to resume talks with the veterans. Sharing a Bonus Army breakfast of potatoes, hard bread, and"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Plot 5 coffee, he learned that the food was running out, and veterans were muttering about rioting against Congress if it did. Before he left for his home in Newtown Square, a small town outside of Philadelphia, he warned the Bonus Marchers, “You’re al l right so long as you keep your sense of humor. If you slip over into lawlessness of any kind, you will lose the sympathy of a hundred twen ty million people in the nation.” It was the government, however, that unleashed the violence. Under orders from President Herbert Hoove r, General Douglas MacArthur led troops in driving the Bonus Army out of Washington at bayonet point and burning down their shacktowns. By August 1 rumors spreading from the last stronghold of the veterans, an encampment at Johnst own, Virginia, indicated that the infuriated Bonus Marchers were determined to organize a new nonpartisan political organization of veterans and want ed General Butler to lead it. Reporters pressed him to comment. “I have heard nothing about it at all, although I was in Washington about two weeks ago to address the vetera ns,” he replied w ith a shrug. “I have neither seen nor heard from Mr. Waters or any of the other leaders of the Bonus Expeditionary Force.” Meanwhile he phoned the governor s of a number of states and won their agreement to provide relief for those of their veterans who wanted to return home. He phones Waters in Washingt on to urge that the remnants of the Bonus Army break camp and start back home under this plan, and he issued a blast at the Hoover Administration as heartless for its treatment of the veterans and its fa ilure to help them, their wives, and their children return home without further humiliation. That November lifelong Republican Smedley Butler took the stump for Franklin D. Roosevelt and helped turn Herbert Hoover out of the White House."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"5 The Plot to Seize the White House 2 On July 1, 1933, General Butler’s phone rang soon after he had had breakfast. Calling from Washington, an American Legion official he had met once or twice told Butler that tw o veterans were on their way from Connecticut to see him about an impor tant matter and urged him to make time for him. About five hours later, heari ng a car pull up into his secluded driveway at Newtown Square, Butler glanced out the porch window. His lips pursed speculatively as two fas tidiously dressed men got out of a chauffeur-driven Packard limousine. At the door the visitors introduced themselves as Bill Doyle, commander of the Massachusetts Am erican Legion, and Gerald C. MacGuire, whom Butler understood to have been a former commander of the Connecticut department. Butler led the visitors into his study at the rear of the house, and they took chairs opposite his desk. MacGui re, who did most of the talking, was a fat, perspiring man with rolls of jowls, a large mouth, fleshy nose, and bright blue eyes. He bega n a somewhat rambling conversation during which he revealed that he, t oo, had been a Marine, with a war wound that had left a silver plate in his head. Doyle established his combat credentials by mentioning that he also had a Purple Heart. Butler’s compassion for wounded veterans made him patient as MacGuire encircled the subject of thei r visit in spirals that only gradually narrowed until their apex pierced th e point. The point, it seemed, was that MacGuire and Doyle, speakin g for a coterie of influential Legionnaires, were intensely dissatisfied with the current leadership of the American Legion. Considering it indifferent to the needs of rank- and-file veterans, they revealed that they hoped to dislodge the regime at a forthcoming Legion convention to be held in Chicago. They urged"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Plot 7 Butler to join them and stampede th e convention with a speech designed to oust the “Royal Family” controlling the organization. Their dissatisfaction with the lead ership of the American Legion did not find Butler unsympathetic . He had long been privately critical of the organization’s close ties with big business and its neglect of the real interests of the veterans it presumab ly represented. These convictions were to be made dramatically public before the year was out, but now he declined his visitors’ proposal on the grounds that he had no wish to get involved in Legion politics and pointed out that, in any event, he had not been invited to take part in the Legion convention. MacGuire revealed that he was ch airman of the “distinguished guest committee” of the Legion, and was on the staff of National Commander Louis Johnson, a former Secretary of Defense. At MacGuire’s suggestion Johnson had included Butler’s name as one of the distinguished guests to be invited to the Chicago convention. Johnson had then taken this list to the Wh ite House, MacGuire said, and had shown it for approval to Louis Howe, Roosevelt’s secretary. Howe had crossed Butler’s name off the list, how ever, saying that the President was opposed to inviting Butler. MacGuire did not know the reason, but Bill Doyle assured Butler that they had devi sed a plan to have him address the convention anyhow. Butler remained silent. He was used to oddball visitors who called with all kinds of weird requests. Cu riosity, and the leisure afforded by retirement, often led him to hear them out in order to fathom their motives. He thought about his visitors’ fine ly tailored suits and the chauffeur- driven Packard an their claim to re present the “plain soldiers” of the Legion. The story about the rej ection of his name on the Legion convention guest list by the White House struck him as more than peculiar, in view of the fact that th e President had gratefully accepted his campaign help in a “Republicans fo r Roosevelt” drive eight months earlier. Why should F.D.R. suddenl y be so displeased with him? It crossed his mind that the purpose of the story, true or false, might be intended to pique him against the Roosevelt Administration, for some obscure reason. Keeping his suspicions"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"8 The Plot to Seize the White House to himself, he heard out his visitors in the hope of learning why they were so anxious to use him. They explained that they had arranged for him to attend the convention as a delegate from Hawaii, which would give him the right to speak. When he still declined, they asked whether he wasn’t in sympathy with their desire to oust the “Royal Family.” He was, he said, because the leadership had simply been usin g the organization to feather their own nests, but he had absolutely no intention of attendi ng the convention without an invitation. His disappointed visitors took their leave but asked permission to return in a few weeks. 3 A month later Doyle and MacGuire re turned. Without waiting to inquire whether Butler had changed his mind, MacGuire quickly informed him that there had been a ch ange of plans. The general had been right to object to coming to the convention as just another de legate, MacGuire acknowledged. It would have been ineffective, and a waste of the general’s immense prestige. MacGuire outlined a new plan in which Butler would gather two or three hundred Legionnaires and take th em to Chicago on a special train. They would be scattered throughout the audience at the convention, and when Butler made an a ppearance in the spectator s’ gallery, they would leap to their feet applauding and ch eering wildly. The proceedings would be stampeded with cries for a speech that would not die down until Butler was asked to the platform. Incredulous at the audacity w ith which this scheme was being unfolded to him, Butler asked what ki nd of speech his visitors expected him to make. MacGuire produced some folded"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Plot 9 typewritten pages from an inside jack et pocket. They would leave a speech with him to read . MacGuire urged Butle r to round up several hundred Legionnaires, meanwhile, to take to Chicago with him. Holding on to his fraying temper, Butler pointed out that none of the Legionnaires he knew could afford the tr ip or stay in Chicago. MacGuire quickly assured him that all their e xpenses would be paid. But Butler, who was constantly being approached with all kinds of wild schemes and proposals, was not prepared to take th e plotters seriously until they could prove they had financial backing. Wh en he challenged MacGuire on this point, the veteran slipped a bankbook out of his pocket. Without letting the name of the bank or the account be seen, he flipped over the pages and showed Butler two recent deposits -one for $42,000 and a second for $64,000-for “expenses.” That settled it. No wounded so ldiers Butler knew possessed $100,000 bank accounts. His instincts sharpene d by two years’ experience, on loan from the Marines, as crime-busting Director of Public Safety for Philadelphia, warned him that ther e was something decidedly unsavory about the proposition. He decided to blend skepticism , wariness, and interest in his responses, to suggest that he might be induced to participate in the scheme if he could be assured that it was foolproof. He would profess himself interested, but unconvinced as long as he suspected that there was more to be learned about the sc heme. So far they had told him practically nothing except what was ba rely necessary for the role they wanted him to play. He determined to get to the bottom of the plot, while trying not to scare them off in the process. After they had left, he read over the speech MacGuire had left with him. It urged the American Legi on convention to adopt a resolution calling for the United States to return to the gold standard, so that when veterans were paid the bonus promised to them, the money they received would not be worthless paper. Butler was baffled. What did a return to the gold standard have to do with th e Legion? Why were MacGuire and Doyle being paid to force this speech on the convention-and who was paying them?"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"9 The Plot to Seize the White House 4 Butler detected an odor of intrigue. Some kind of outlandish scheme, he was convinced, was afoot. Knowing lit tle about the gold standard, why Roosevelt had taken the count ry off it or who stood to gain by its restoration and why, he began thumbing through the financia l pages of newspapers and magazines-sections of the press he had never had any occasion to read. The first important fact he learne d was that the government no longer had to back up every paper dollar with a dollar’s worth of gold. This meant that the Roosevelt Administration coul d increase the supply of paper money to keeps its pledge of making jobs fo r the unemployed, and give loans to farmers and homeowners whose property was threatened by foreclosure. Banks would then be paid back in cheapened paper dollars for the gold- backed dollars they had lent. Conservative financiers were horri fied. They view ed a currency not solidly backed by gold as inflationary, undermining both private and business fortunes and leading to na tional bankruptcy. Roosevelt was damned as a socialist or Communist out to destroy private enterprise by sapping the gold backing of wealth in order to subsidize the poor. Butler began to understand that some wealthy Americans might be eager to use the American Legion as an instrument to pressure the Roosevelt Administration into restoring the gold standard. But who was behind MacGuire? A short while after MacGuire’s sec ond visit, he returned to see Butler again, this time alone. MacGuire asked how he was coming along in rounding up veterans to take with him to the co nvention. Butler replied evasively that he had been too busy to do anything about it. He then made it clear that he could no further intere st in the plan unless MacGuire was willing to"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Plot 11 be candid and disclose the sources of the funds that were behind it. After some hesitation MacGuire rev ealed that they had been provided by nine backers, the biggest contribu tor putting up nine thousand dollars. Pressed to explain their motives, MacGuire insisted that they were simply concerned about helping veterans get their bonu s and a square deal. People who could afford such contributions, Butler reflected ironically, were hardly the type who favored a two-billion-dollar bonus for veterans. When he prodded MacGuire further, the fat veteran revealed that one of his chief backers was a wealthy Le gionnaire he worked for, Colonel Grayson M.-P. Murphy, who operated a brokerage firm at 52 Broadway in New York City. Butler pointed out th e contradiction between MacGuire’s claim that his group was concerned w ith the problems of the poor rank-and- file veteran and the fact that his b ackers were all obviously wealthy men. MacGuire simply shrugged and frankly adm itted that as far as he personally was concerned, he was primarily involved in the transaction as a businessman and was being well taken care of for his efforts. It would be equally profitable for Butler, he hinted , if the general were disposed to cooperate. Butler pumped him about Colonel Mu rphy’s connection with the plan. Murphy, MacGuire revealed, was one of the founders of the Legion and had actually underwritten it with $125,000 in 1919 to pay for the organizational field work. He had been motivated by a desire to see the soldiers “cared for.” When Butler questioned Murphy’s motive in wanting the gold- standard speech made at the convention, MacGuire explaine d that he and the other backers simply wanted to be sure that the veterans would be paid their bonus in sound gold-backed currenc y, not in “rubber money.” He showed Butler several check s for large amounts signed by Murphy and two other men-Robe rt S. Clark and John"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"12 The Plot to Seize the White House Mills. Clark’s name rang a bell with Butler. He had known a Second Lieutenant Robert S. Clark in Ch ina during the Boxer Campaign who had been called “the millionaire lieutenant.” The money, MacGuire said, woul d be used to open an expense account for Butler in Chicago. He hoped that the general would now get busy rounding up veterans to take to the convention. Butler remained noncommittal. He intended to procrastinate as long as he could, continuing to pump Ma cGuire until had enough information to make a complete report to the government. The Pre sident, he felt, ought to know what schemes his rich opponent s were up to overturn New Deal policies. After the visit, Butler brooded over the implication of MacGuire’s revelation that his employer, key f ounder and sponsor of the American Legion, was involved. Tall, heavyset , Grayson Mallot-Prevost Murphy* not only operated one of Wall Street’s leading brokerage houses but was also a director of Guaranty Trust, a Morgan bank, and had extensive industrial and financial interests as a director of Anaconda Copper, Goodyear Tire, and Bethlehem Steel. A West Point gra duate, Murphy was a veteran of the Spanish-American War and World War I with the rank of colonel. Butler’s bushy eyebrows rose when he also learned that the fi nancier had been decorated by Benito Mussolini, who had made him a Command of the Crown of Italy. Butler found out that he had been one of twenty American officers who had met in Paris in February, 1919, reportedly on orders from the commanders of the A.E.F., to counter revolutionary unrest in Europe following the end of World War I, by forming a veterans’ organization with the alleged purpose of looking after ve terans’ welfare and uniting them to defend America at home as they had abroad. Murphy had put up $125, 000 to get the Ameri can Legion going, and it had been organized in the spring with a caucus of about a thousand officers and men. The Legion had then solicited funds and support from industrialists. Swift and Company ex ecutives had written other firms, “We are all * The Grayson Mallet-Prevost Murphy referred to here and throughout the book died on October 19, 1937."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Plot 13 Legion, the results it will obtain, and the ultimate effect in helping to offset radicalism.” The average veteran who joined the Legion in the 1920’s had been unaware that big-business men were ba cking it to use it as a strikebreaking agency. When workers struck against wage cuts, Legion posts were informed that the strikers were Co mmunists trying to create national chaos so that the Reds could take over. Le gionnaires were give n baseball bats to break up strikes and civil rights demonstrations. The American Civil Liberties Union later reported, “Of the forces most active in attacking civil rights, the American Legion led the field.” The rank and file, however, had grown increasingly restless and impatient with the “Royal Family” that ran the Legion, especially after the Depression had left so many jobless. Ve terans forced to sell apples on street corners were angered by a Legion l eadership that opposed the bonus and government spending as inflationary. That was why so many thousands had bypassed the Legion to join the Bonus March on Washington. Adding up the facts, Butler was stru ck by a startling contradiction. MacGuire had claimed to speak for rank-and-file discontent with the Legion’s bosses and professe d to want to oust them, yet he was an agent for a top founder of the Legion who was obvi ously one of the powers behind the throne. MacGuire had revealed that the Legion still owed Murphy part of the $125,000 foundation money he had provided and had tacitly acknowledged that Murphy “makes the kings.” MacGuire obviously had to be lyi ng in his claim that he-or Murphy- wanted to topple the pres ent leadership. Why? Pe rhaps it was a ruse to channel and control popular discont ent in the Legion, hopefully with Butler’s help, for the purposes of the nine wealthy men behind MacGuire. Butler awaited MacGuire’s next move with deep intersest."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"13 The Plot to Seize the White House 5 In September Butler was as ked to address a conventi on of the Legion’s 29th Division at Newark, New Jersey. On th e Sunday morning he was in the city, the phone rang in his hotel room. It was MacGuire, who was in the lobby and asked to see him. Invited to Butler’s room, MacGuire reminded the general that the time for the American Legion Convention wa s rapidly approaching. Was Butler finally ready to take a contingent of veterans to Chica go and make the gold- standard speech? Butler displayed increasing skepticism about the whole plan. In a gruff voice he challenged MacGuire’s pr oposal as a bluff without any real money behind it. His visitor whipped a fat wallet out of his hip pocket, extracted a mass of thousand-dollar bi lls, and scattered them all over the bed. The eighteen thousand dollars, he said smugly, would amply cover the expenses of Butler and the ve terans he led to Chicago. The gesture caught Butler by surprise; losing his temper, he accused MacGuire of trying to give him t housand-dollar bills whose number had been recorded, so that once he cashed them, the plotters would have proof of his complicity. MacGuire hastily assu red him that he c ould have smaller denominations. In his vexation Butler snapped at the bond salesman to take back the money immediately, as he had no intention of getting involved in MacGuire’s scheme. But then, as he re gained control of his anger, he sought to make it appear that he was merely indignant that he was forced to deal with an emissary. He would negotiate , he told MacGuire firmly, only with principals. After some hesitation MacGuire agreed to have him contacted by Robert S.

He was going to the American Legion conve ntion in a private car attached to the Pennsylvania Limited, he told Butler. He planned to have the train stop at Paoli to pick the general up, and they would continue on to Chicago together. A suite of rooms had alr eady been reserved for Butler at the Palmer House. Clark would see to it, he told the general, that Butler was calling for a resolution demanding restoration of the gold standard. In discussing the speech, the millionaire was induced to re veal that the author was none other than John W. Davis, the 1924 Democrat ic candidate for President, and now chief attorney for J. P. Morgan and Company. Butler pointed out to Clark that the speech did not seem to have anything to do with the soldiers’ bon us, which was presumably the purpose of his trip to Chicago. Shrugging, Clark blandly repeated MacGuire’s assurance that those suppor ting the speech simply want ed to be sure that the bonus would be paid in gold-backed currency, not in worthless paper. Butler decided to draw blood and observe Clark’s reaction. Sharp eyes honed on his visitor’s face, he s uggested that the speech had all the earmarks of big-business propaganda. The banker, taken aback, did not reply for a moment. He seemed to be debating with himself whether to deny the allegation or take Butler into his confidence. Then he astonished the general by a sudden burst of candor. He had a personal fortune of thirty million dollars, he revealed, and he was greatly worried about losing it to a Roosevelt inflation-runaway government spending unbridled by the need to back each paper dollar with gold. He was willing to spend fully ha lf his fortune if it would save the other half.

Why, Butler asked him curiously, did he think the President would allow himself to be pressured by such tactics? Clark expressed confidence that Roosevelt would yield because he be longed, after all, to the same social class that was solidly behind the gold st andard. Once he had restored it, his fellow patricians would rally around him and defe nd his position against criticism. Butler was shocked by Clark’s blatan t snobbery, but even more by the millionaire’s assumption that the wishes of economic royalists should-and would-prevail over the democratic pro cesses of government. Once more his anger boiled over. In a voice that cracked with indignation, he exploded that he wanted nothing to do with a scheme to exploit veterans. Furthermore, he rasped, he intended to see to it that the veterans of the country were not used to undermine democracy but to defend it. Clark’s face turned crimson. Ch agrined, he reproached Butler for being stubborn and “different ,” hinting that such things as the mortgage on Butler’s house could be taken care of fo r him, and in a fully legal fashion. This crude attempt to bribe him was too much for the dumbfounded general. Bellowing his indi gnation, he roared an or der at the millionaire to follow him into the living room.

On the other hand, it seemed hardly likely that after his explosion the plo tters could possibly believe they could persuade or buy him. He would have no further op portunity to ferret out their plans. A few days later he carefully st udied a newspaper account of the proceedings of the American Legion convention I Chicago. The story revealed that a huge flood of telegr ams had poured into the convention urging delegates to endorse a return to the gold standard. A resolution to this effect had been proposed and carried.

He was promised transportation in a private car, and, MacGuire beamed, Butler wo uld be paid a thousand dollars to speak at the dinner-in favor of the gold standard, of course. Butler was dumbfounded at MacGuire ’s incredible persistence. Surely the indefatigable bond salesman ha d realized by this time that he was barking up the wrong tree! But perhaps, the gene ral speculated, MacGuire felt challenged to “make the sale,” in much the same manner that he undoubtedly sought to overcome the sale s resistance of reluctant prospects for his bonds. And apparently MacGui re was convinced that only Smedley Butler had the prestige and popularity among veterans that his coterie needed to put over the scheme.

In the Marines Butler had al ways had a soft spot for incorrigible rascals who brightened up monotonous routine by their unpredictable shenanigans. Besides, he was still curious to lear n more about what the plotters in the gold scheme were up to. MacGuire now revealed a new plan to involve the general through his impending lectur e tour for the V.F.W. Wasn’t he, MacGuire probed, going to use the opport unity to speak out on public issues important to the veterans? Butler wasn ’t sure whether this was simply a shrewd guess or whether MacGuire so mehow had eyes and ears all over the country. Butler declared that he believed that democracy was in danger from growing antidemocratic forces within the country and that he planned to appeal to the nation’s veterans to unite against this threat. At the same time he wanted to alert them to the risk of being dragged into another war by the propaganda of organizations camouf laged with patriotic trappings. MacGuire looked thoughtful. Then he asserted that the group he represented really had the identical obj ectives. He urged Butler to let him go along on the tour. He would stay in the background, enlisting veterans in “a great big superorganization to maintain our democracy.” Butler lost no time in squelching that idea. He admitted that he couldn’t keep MacGuire off any train he rode, but made it firmly clear that he would not be associated with the pl ans of MacGuire and his rich friends in any way. He softened the repriman d by saying that he did not want to hurt the feelings of a wounded vetera n, but MacGuire would have to understand that he could not be used to aid money schemes.

Soon afterward Butler began his sw ing around the country for the V.F.W. He was no longer bothered -for the moment-by the persistent attentions of Jerry MacG uire, who left for Europe on December 1, on a mission for his backers. MacGuire took his departure agai nst the background of a steadily rising chorus of hatred for \"that cripple in th e White House\" by big- business leaders. It was reflected in the anti-Roos evelt slant of both news and editorials in the bu siness-oriented press. In the eyes of America's industrialists and bankers, the President, if not an actual secret Communist, was dedicated to destroying the na tion's capitalist eco nomy by the New Deal, which they labeled \"creeping socialism.\" Many believed that unless F.D.R. were stopped, he would soon take America down the same road that the Russians had trav eled. They were horrified by his recogni tion of the Soviet Union on November 16, 1 933, seeing it as a sinister omen. They were equally appalled by hi s speech six weeks later promising that the Unite d States would send no more armed forces to Latin Am erica to protect pr ivate investments. Some business leaders envied their counterpar ts in Italy, who had financed Mussolini's rise to power. Il Duce's efficiency in \"making the trains run on time\" was highly lauded, along with the dict atorial control of labor unions by his cor porate state. Thomas Lamont, a J. P.

Continuing his tour fo r the V.F.W., Butler ob served more and more storm signals flying in th e United States as he traveled ar ound the country. The nation was rapidly becoming polari zed between the for ces of Left and Right. Demagogues with apparently inexhaustible funds for propaganda and agitation led \"patriotic\" crusad es against Communists, Jews, and \"Jewish bankers,\" who were allege d to be behind the New Deal. That June Roosevelt further inflamed big business by a whole new series of New Deal acts that crippled stock speculation, se up watchdog agencies over the teleph one, telegraph, and radio industries, stopped farm foreclosures, prevented employer s from hindering unionization and compelled them to accept collective bargaining. As an epidemic of turbulent strikes broke ou t, the orchestration of Roosevelt hatred in the nation's press rose to a fresh crescendo. To Herbert Hoover the New Deal represented \"class hatred . . . preached from the White House,\" \"despotism,\" and \"universal bankruptcy.\" Butler was intrigued by the July, 1934 issue of Fortune, the Luce magazine read by America's lead ing industrialists and bankers, which devoted a whole edition t glorifyi ng Italian fascism. It was produced by Laird S. Go ldsborough, foreign editor for Time , who asked Fortune's wealthy readers \"whether Fa scism is achieving in a few years or decades such a conquest of the spirit of man as Christianity achieved only in ten centuries.\" He c oncluded, \"The good journalist must recognize in Fascism certain ancient virtues of the r ace, whether or not they happen to h momentarily fashionabl e in his own country.

Butler and his wife had planned to drive into Philadelphia that afternoon, so, curiosity aroused, he agreed to meet MacGuire at the Bellevue Hotel. It was August 22, 1934, three days after a German plebescite had approved vesting sole executive power in Adolf Hitler as führer of Nazi Germany. Shortly before three o'clock Butle r entered the empty hotel lobby, where he found the pudgy bond salesman waiting for him.

MacGuire revealed what he had been up to on the Continent (hiring the previous seven months. His backer s had sent him abroad to study the role that veterans' organizations had played in working for and bringing about dictatorships. In Italy MacGuire had f ound that Mussolini's real power stemmed from veterans organized in his Black Shirts; they had made him dictator and were the chie f protectors of his regime. Beginning to suspect what MacGuire had in mind, Butler tried to seem matter-of-fact as he asked wh ether MacGuire thought Mussolini's form of government was a good exampl e for American veterans to work toward. MacGuire didn't think so. His investigations on the Continen t, he revealed, had convinced him that neither Mussolini no r Hitler, nor the kind of paramilitary organizations they had built, could be made attract ive to the American veteran. But he had discovered an or ganization that could be, he revealed in elation. He had been in France during a nationa l crisis brought about by nationwide wage slashes. Riots had erupted in Pa ris early in Februa ry, ending in the calling of a general strike that had paralyzed the country. Civil war had been averted only by the formation of a National Union ministry made up of all parties except Socialists, Communists, and Royalists. A key role in ending the crisis had been played by a rightwing veterans' organization called the Croix de Feu. It was a superorganization, MacGuire explained, an amalgama tion of all other French veteran organizations, and was composed of officers and noncoms. The Croix de Feu had 500,000 members, and each was a leader of ten others, so that their voting strength amounted to 5,000,000. It occurred to Butler th at if MacGuire's desc ription was accurate, the Croix de Fen was an elitis t outfit minus the democra tic voice of the greatest majority of veterans-the buck privates , who were expected only to follow and obey, exactly as they had b een ordered to do in wartime. MacGuire now told Butler that his group planned to build"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"24 The Plot to Seize the White House an American version of the Croix de Fen. Asked its purpose, the fat man hesitated, then replied that it was inte nded to \"support\" the President. Butler asked wryly why Roosevelt should need the support of 500,000 \"supersoldiers\" when he had the whole American people behind him. Looking petulant and impatient, MacGuire ignored the question, pointing out that the crux of the matt er was Roosevelt's dilemma in not having enough money to finance the New Deal and the danger that he might disrupt the American system of fina nce to get it. MacGuire and his group were firmly determined that the Presi dent would not be allowed to do it. Despite MacGuire's exasperating circ umlocution and the twists in his logic, a fresh pattern was becoming clear to Butler. Far from \"supporting\" Franklin Delano Roosevelt, MacGuire and the interests behind him were obviously planning to compel the Preside nt to yield to their demands about American finances. The American version of the Croix de Fen was intended to be a powerful paramilitary organization to enforce those demands. But when Butler pressed him on its purpose, MacGuire denied emphatically any intention to frighten the President. In fa ct, he explained, the whole idea was really to support and help Rooseve lt, who was obviously overworked, by providing him with an \"Assistant Preside nt\" to take details of the office off his shoulders. It was quite constitutional, MacGuire insisted. The aide would be called a Secretary of General Affairs. According to MacGuire, the Presid ent himself had been grooming an aide for such a role-General Hugh S. Jo hnson, controversial administrator of the National Recovery Administration (N.R.A.). But, MacGuire confided, Johnson had been too loose-lipped to suit Roosevelt, and as a result was slated to be fired within three or four weeks. Pressed to explain how he acquire d this information, MacGuire assured Butler that his group was clos e to the White House and had advance information on all such secret matters.

Butler did not have to feign new in terest in MacGuire's proposals; obviously much more was now involve d than simply lobbying efforts for restoration of the gold standard. Ma cGuire, interpreting the general's absorption as an omen of cooperation, grew more candid about the plan of his group. They would work up p ublic sympathy for the overburdened President, he explained eagerly, by a campaign explaining that Roosevelt's health was failing. The \"dumb\" public would accept the need to give him \"relief\" by having a Cabinet official ta ke the chores of patronage and other routine worries of the office off his sh oulders. Then the President's status would become like that of the President of France, a ceremonial figurehead, while the Secretary of Gene ral Affairs ran the country. Thus, at one stroke, the country would be rid of Roosevelt's misrule and would be put back on the gold st andard. And now, MacGuire concluded triumphantly, how did the general feel about heading the new \"superorganization\" that would be th e power behind bringing about these sweeping changes? Unable to contain himself any longer, Butler exploded that if MacGuire and his backers tried to m ount a Fascist putsch, he would raise another army of 500,000 veterans to oppose them and the nation would be plunged into a new civil war. Upset, MacGuire hastily assured th e general that he and his group had no such intentions, but only sought to ease the burdens of the Presidency. Butler sarcastically expressed doubt th at Roosevelt would appreciate their concern and turn his executive power over to their \"Secretary of General Affairs,\" while limiting himself to ceremonial functions. Besides, Butler pointed out tersely, any a ttempt to build a huge para military army of half a million men would require enormous funds. MacGuire revealed that he now had $3 million in working funds and could get $300 million if it were needed . He added that in about a year Butler would be able to assemble 500,000 veterans, with the expectation that such a show of force would enable th e movement to gain control of the government fully in just a few days."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"26 The Plot to Seize the White House Butler was stunned.

MacGuire replied that Clark was good for $ 1 5 million and that the rest would come from the same people who had financed the \"Chicago propaganda\" about the gold stan dard at the American Legion convention, and who were now behind the planned march on Washington. What plans, Butler want ed to know, did they have to take care of the veterans?

By the rule of successi on, Secretary of State Co rdell Hull was next in line, but he was far too old and coul d easily be set aside to make way for a Secretary of General Affair s to take Roosevelt's place as President.

According to the bond salesman, there had been a meeting in Paris to decide upon the selection of the man to head the superorganization. MacGuire and hi s group had held out for Butler, but the Morgan interests distrusted the general as \"too radical,\" preferring Douglas MacArthur instead. MacArthur's term as Chief of St aff expired in November, and the Morgan interests felt that if Roosevelt failed to reappoint him, he would be bitter enough to accept their offer. Bu tler observed that MacArthur would be likely to have difficulty in lining up veterans behind him, because his dispersion of the Bonus Army had made him highly unpopular. MacGuire indicated that the Mo rgan coterie's second choice was Hanford MacNider, an Iowa manufactur er who was a former commander of the American Legion.

Even as Butler brooded over the affair and wondered what to do about it, another of MacGuire's uncannily accurate predictions materi alized two weeks after their talk. In September, 1934, the press a nnounced the formation of a new organization, the American Liberty League, by discontented captains of industry and finance. They announced their objectives as \"to combat radicalism, to teach the necessity of respect for the rights of persons and property, and generally to foster free private enterprise.\" Denouncing the New Deal, they att acked Roosevelt for \"fomenting class hatred\" by using such terms as \"unscrupulous money changers,\" \"economic royalists,\" and \"the priv ileged princes of these new economic dynasties.\""},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Plot 31 Butler's eyes widened when he read that the treasurer of the American Liberty League was none other than MacGuire's own boss, Grayson M.-P. Murphy, and one of its financiers was Robert S. Clark. Heading and directing the organization were Du Po nt and J. P. Morgan and Company men. Morgan attorney John W. Da vis was a member of the National Executive Committee-the same Davis that Clark had identified as author of the gold-standard speech MacGuire had tried to get Butler to make to the American Legion convention in Chicago. Heavy contributors to the Americ an Liberty League included the Pitcairn family (Pittsburgh Plate Gla ss), Andrew W. Mellon Associates, Rockefeller Associates, E. F. Hutt on Associates, William S. Knudsen (General Motors), and the Pew family (Sun Oil Associates). J. Howard Pew, longtime friend and suppor ter of Robert Welch, who later founded the John Birch Society, was- a generous patron, along with other members of the Pew family, of extremist right-wing cause s. Other directors of the league included A1 Smith and John J. Raskob. Two organizations affiliated with th e league were openly Fascist and antilabor. One was the Sentinels of th e Republic, financed chiefly by the Pitcairn family and J. Howard Pe w. Its members labeled the New Deal \"Jewish Communism\" and insisted \"the old line of Americans of $1,200 a year want a Hitler.\" The other was the Southern Committe e to Uphold the Constitution, which the conservative Baltimore Sun described as \"a hybrid organization financed by northern money, but playing on the Ku Klux Klan prejudices of the south.\" Its sponsor, John H. Kirby, collaborated in anti-Semitic drives against the New Deal with the Reverend Gerald L. K. Smith, leader of the first Silver Shirt squad of American storm troopers. \"The brood of anti-New Deal orga nizations spawned by the Liberty League,\" the New York Post subsequently charged, \"are in turn spawning Fascism.\" Butler was stunned by this fulfillment of MacGuire's prediction.

Even yet another of MacGuire's predictions came true a fortnight later, when A1 Smith published a scathing attack on the New Deal in the New Outlook, breaking publicly with the Pre sident over economic policies. If Butler had had any lingering doubts about the authenticity of MacGuire's claim to have inside know ledge of what American big-business leaders were up to, the appearance of the American Liberty League on schedule, and A1 Smith's break with the White House, convinced him that MacGuire's revelations of a plot to seize the White House were no crackpot's fantasy. MacGuire had called the shots every time. Butler was now genuinely alarmed. For the first time it dawned upon him that if the American Liberty League was, indeed, the \"superorganization\" behind the plot th at it seemed to be, the country's freedom was in genuine peril. Such money and power as the men behind the League possessed could easily mobilize a thinly disguised Fascist army from the ranks of jobless, embittered vete rans and do what Mussolini had done in Italy with the financial suppor t of the Italian plutocracy. Getting in touch with Van Zandt, Butler told the V.F.W. commander that he had been approached to lead a coup as head of a veterans' army. He warned that the conspirators intended to try to involve Van Zandt, too, at the V.F.W, convention in Louisville. Tha nking him for the warning, Van Zandt assured Butler that he would have nothing to do with the plotters. Butler was tempted to leave for Washington immediately to warn the President or his advisers. He now knew enough to expose the whole plot.

MacGuire, of course, would deny ev erything. So would Robert S. Clark. So would everyone connected wi th the American Liberty League-if this was, indeed, the superorganizati on MacGuire had rev ealed was behind the plot.

Convinced that the demo cracy he cherished was in genuine danger, he steeled himself for the ordeal of public mockery and humiliating attacks that he knew would follow hi s exposure of the conspiracy. He was enough of an expert tactician, howev er, to know that he couldn't win his battle without supporting troops. He would need corroborative testimony by someone whose word, when combined with his own, would have to be respected and force a full-scale investigation. Butler confided in Tom O'Neil, city editor of the Philadelphia Record. Observing that the whole affair smacked of outright treason to him, he asked O'Neil to assign his star reporter to di g into the story. O'Neil agreed, and reporter Paul Comly French, whose news features also app eared in the New York Post, was instructed to seek confirmation of the plot. Butler knew and respected French, who had done an inte lligent and honest job of covering his fight against crime and corruption in Philadelphia ten years earlier. French set about determining whethe r MacGuire and his group were operating some kind of racket to extort money out of the rich by selling them political gold bricks, or whether a cab al of rich men, enraged by the President and his policie s, was putting up big m oney to overthrow F.D.R. with a putsch."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"34 The Plot to Seize the White House In view of the powerful people the gene ral had named in connection with the plot, French knew that his assignment was a keg of dynamite.

Some of his forebears in cluded pacifists who had operated an underground rail road station for runaway slaves, and grandparents who had joined the Union Army to defend Gettysburg against Robert E.

Once when he had advocated a large Navy, a close Quaker friend reproached him, \"Thee is a fine Friend!\" \"Thee,\" the fine Friend snorted, \"is a damn fool!\" The Quaker archaisms thee, thy, and thine were used only within the family and sometimes to intimate fri ends. The Quakerism of both Thomas Butler and his son Smedle y was of that order of earlier hot-tempered Quakers who belabored each other with wagon t ongues, while pausing between the hearty blows they exchanged to invok e divine fo rgiveness. Smedley picked up some of his father's uninhibited language as early as age five, inviting mate rnal chastisement until his father went to his defense by roaring, \"I don't want a son who does n't know how to use an honest damn now and then!\" 37"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"38 The Plot to Seize the White House Reared in upper-class comfort with a politically prominent father, grandfather, and uncles, it was taken for granted that he was marked for prominence. Subtle pressures were exer ted by four maiden aunts who adored and fussed over their first nephew, keep ing him in golden curls and dressing him in a Little Lord Fauntleroy suit. Jeering peers who mistook the clothes for the boy found his fistwork as fancy as his finery. Stirred by tales of both his gra ndfathers in the Union Army, he developed a passionate love for tin soldiers, toy cannon, and books with pictures of battles. His mother, Maud Darlington Butler, sought to inculcate peaceful doctrines in her son by taki ng him to Hicksite Quaker meeting twice a week and sending him to the Fri ends' grade school in West Chester. However, his early fascination with things martial persisted. When he was twelve, he joined a West Cheste r branch of the Boys' Brigade, a preparedness youth movement that went in for military drills. His father had no objection and even bought his son th e first uniform Smedley ever wore. He felt proud. At Haverford Preparatory School n ear Philadelphia, a popular choice of old Quaker families, he joined bot h the baseball and the football teams. Although he was younger and lighter than his teamma tes, his fighting spirit, qualities of leadership, candor, and fair dealing made him highly popular and won him the captaincy of both teams. He was only a little over sixteen and a half on February 15, 1898, when the U.S. battleship Maine blew up in Havana Harbor at 9:40 P.M.

But thee is too young.\" Smedley's jaw jutted. \"If thee won't he lp me, I'll run away and join the general army!\" \"If thee does, it will avail thee nothing,\" his father said quietly. \"I will see that they discharge thee.\" One night the crestfallen youth overh eard his father tell his mother privately that Congress had authorized an increase of the Marine Corps by two thousand men and twenty-four second lieutenants for the duration of the war. \"The Marine Corps is a finely trained body of men,\" his father said. \"Too bad Smedley is so young.

Huge-handed, he had a husky voice that quickly developed into a leatherneck growl, and a lively sense of humor that appealed to his fellow Marines. His first glimpse of war came the day he arrived at Santiago, Cuba, on July 1, 1898, past a Spanish cruiser st ill burning in the harbor. Rigid with excitement, he boarded another ship that took him to Guantanamo Bay, where he joined the Marine Battali on of the North Atlantic Squadron. Next day Mancil C. Goodrell, the cap tain of Butler's company, took him on a two-man reconnaissance of enemy positions. As they moved along a mountain trail, a shot rang out, and a bullet whizzed past Butler's head.

The Marines sailed for Chin a to rescue the American legation, which had been imperiled by the Boxe r uprising. The expedition numbered only a hundred Marines, but by the time they arrived in China, the situation had reached crisis proportions. All of North China was now up in arms against the foreign powers who had carved the country into colonial spheres of influence. The Chinese bitterly resented the alien flags that flew over the imperialist compounds and the foreign ships that dominated Ch inese ports, flooding the country with Western goods. Most infuriating of all were entrance signs the foreign legations had posted at their luxur ious clubs: \"Forbidden to dogs and Chinese.\" Eventually the allied nations had to send over 100,000 troops to protect their nationals. The eighteen-year-old Butler, who had no understanding of the political causes of the Boxer Rebellion, saw his role simply as that of a Marine doing his duty to protect Amer ican citizens on foreign soil.

During the weary retreat of the Mari nes, Butler consta ntly fought off an urge to collapse and give himself over to sleep or death, without caring too much which. Suddenly the crack of a bullet was followed by a dull sound right next to him. Startled, he looked up to see a stream of blood flowing down the face of a grizzled sergeant.

A burning sensation in his right thigh puzzled Butler momentarily until he realized he had been shot. I gnoring his wound, he continued to help carry Partridge until they reached some high ground. There he applied first aid to the private's wounds, then limpe d off in search of a medic for him. By the time he found a Marine doc tor, blood was pouring copiously out of his own wound.

From his own experience in the Philippi nes and China, Butler guessed that Waller had suspected the carriers of be ing rebels. It was impossible to tell apart insurrectionists and noncombatant natives. The twenty-one-year-old Marine captain was not yet troubled by doubts as to what the Marines were or dered to do in the service of their country, or why. He shared the easy c ondescension of most Marines of that swashbuckling era toward people of underdeveloped countries as naive natives who had to be patronized, di rected, and protected by Americans. The Marines were an e lite gendarmerie entrus ted with the duty of maintaining international law and order on behalf of civilization. A Marine's only concern was carrying out his orders as expertly as possible, without questions. It was only later, as he gradually came to know native peoples better and learned to admire their age-old customs and traditions, that Smedley Butler felt impelled to questi on his role as an instrument of American foreign policy. 4 When a revolution broke out in Hondura s early in 1903, Butler's battalion was dispatched there aboard an old banana freighter, the Panther, as part of a squadron under Admiral Coghlan. On the second day out the ship's commander summoned all hands to the quarterdeck to complain that so meone had been using profane language near his cabin. \"I know the guilty party cannot be one of these fine men,\" he declared, indicating the sailors, \"therefo re it must have been one of these men enlisted from the slums of our big cities.\" Pointing to the Marines, he restricted their use of the deck.

Now Butler did not hesitate to write his father field reports in the Plain Language, sometimes aski ng him to use his influence on the House Naval Affairs Committee on beha lf of the Marine Corps. Thomas Butler did not always consent, but di d serve informally as the Marines' court of last resort against Navy hostility. In Honduras Smedley was vague as to what the trouble was all about, noting, \"It all seemed like a Gilber t and Sullivan war.\" He led a force ashore at Trujillo between government and rebel for ces who were firing at each other to rescue the Am erican consular agent. After - seeing some duty in Panama, for which he won an Expeditionary Medal, he returned to the Philadelphia Na vy Yard in 1905. A pretty Georgia-born girl named Et hel Conway Peters, some of whose family had been prominent in the affa irs of Philadelphia since Colonial times, helped him make good use of hi s leave time. They were married on June 3o at Bay Head, New Jersey, in a military wedding. Commented the Philadelphia Inquirer: \"Cupid and Mars in a wedding by the sea at high noon today.\" Their honeymoon was a world trip made possible by orders assigning him to the Ph ilippines as captain of Company E, Second Regiment. Arriving with his bride by way of Europe, India, and Singapore, he was stationed at a small naval base on Subic Bay, sixty miles north of Manila. Here, in November, 1906, hi s daughter Ethel was born. Butler's popularity led to her adoption by the regiment. Giving a dinner for the enlisted men, he carried her to the table on a pill ow as guest of honor.

He a nd his men lived ruggedly on hardtack, hash, and coffee. A Navy supply tug, which never brought them suppli es or rations, continued to ignore them ev en when they si gnaled that they had run out of hash. Butler decided to sail to the Navy supply base across the bay. With two volunteers he set out in a nati ve outrigger. A typhoon blew up suddenly behind them, ri pping away their sail an d snapping their paddles. For five hours they fought to keep from drowning until the storm finally blew the seafaring trio as hore at the supply base. Soaked and chilled, Butler lost no time in arranging to have the supply tug carry be ef and vegetables back to his men. The hungry Marines cheered his return on th e tug. The camp dock had b een swept away by the typhoon, so they sp lashed out into the bay to form a chain that passed the food they splashed from tug to shore. Butler was a hero to his men, but not to the Navy brass who heard about his bypass of official channels. A Navy board of medical survey deci ded that his taking the outrigger into a typhoon, and use of the tug to take supplies hack to his men, indicated signs of an \"impending nervous breakdown.\" He was ordered home. In October, 1908, desp ite the dim view of him taken by the Navy brass, be was promoted to the rank of major.

Althou gh he was stationed on the Isthmus for four years until the Panama Can al was opened, he was temporarily detached three times to command expe ditions into strife-torn Nicaragua. Washington had decided to intervene openly in the internal affairs of that Central American country. Butler' s orders each time were \"to protect American lives and property.\" He soon realized that th is general order involved propping up Ni caraguan governments or factions that were favored in Washington fo r business reasons. The Conservative party was seeking to drive the Liberals out of power. Their revolt was led by Adolfo Diaz, secretary treas urer of the La Luz Mining Company, in which Secr etary of State Philander C. Knox was said to own stock. The Liberal Gove rnment had smashed Diaz's forces and pinned 350 survivors at Bl uefields, where Butler had been sent with the 4th Battalion. The American Cons ul at Bluefields made it clear to Butler that the State Department wa nted Diaz to prevail. Two Liberal generals prepared to take Bluefields with fifteen thousand well-armed men. Before the shoo ting could start, Butler sent them a message. The Marines were there onl y as neutrals pr otecting American residents, he told the attackers. The government forces could take the town but must leave their guns outside the city so that no Americans were accidentally shot. Marine gua rds would be posted outs ide the city to collect all weapons from Nicar aguans entering it. How could they take the town, th e dismayed genera ls protested, without arms? And why weren't Diaz's fo rces inside the town also being disarmed? Butler thought fast. \"There is no danger of the defe nders killing American citizens, because they will be shooting outward,\" he replied blandly, \"but your soldiers would be firing toward us.\" The ploy compelled the government forces to retr act, giving the Conservative forces time to regroup and mount a counterattack that soon overthrew the Liberals. Juan Estrada became the new Pres ident, with Diaz as Vice-President. Butler felt somewhat uneasy about the role the Marines had been compelled to play in this co up, especially since he knew"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The Indispensable Man 53 that the American people had no idea of how Secret ary of State Knox was using the armed forces in Central America, or why. But as a Marine officer he did not feel responsible for foreig n policy. He saw his role simply as implementing that policy by dutifully carrying out his country's orders as he was sworn to do. Before the Marines returned to Pana ma, he was confronted by a host of Bluefields shopkeepers who presen ted him with unpaid bills signed by members of his battalion, including George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Yankee Doodle. From the handwriting Butler deciphered the true identity of these pseudonyms and saw to it that they paid up. The first to defend his men against injustices, he al so insisted that they scrupulously honor their word to tradesmen in whatever foreign land they were stationed, to protect the Corps's good name. One month later the Nicaraguan revo lutionary pot boil ed over again. General Luis Mena, the Conservative party's Minister of War, had overthrown Estrada as President and ha d been overthrown in turn by Diaz. Mena went into rebellion with gove rnment troops loyal to him and had returned to attack Ma nagua, the capital. Butler was rushed to Managua with a force of 350 men and orde red to prop up th e faltering Diaz government. Finding Diaz in the field and govern ment forces in the capital in chaos, he took command of them. The American minister informed him that American banking in terests had taken over the national railroad as security for a loan to th e Diaz government, so that it must now be protected as \"American property.\" But it ran th rough territory co ntrolled by three thousand of Mena's troops, who had captured a train and held it against a small Marine force sent to retake it. Nicaraguan newspapers mocked the Americans' rout. Mena's forces refused to let any other trains throu gh, cutting off supplies from the port. On August 25, 1912, Butler was orde red to retake the captured train and open the railroad line.

I cannot stand any slur on our Corps and I will wipe it off or quit.\" 5 With a hundred Marine volunteers behind him, Butler located the train and approached the rebel forces guarding it with two heavy cloth bags in his hands. His way was barred by machetes and bayone ts, and he was warned to retreat or have his small force an nihilated. Through an interpreter he informed the rebels that the bags in his hands held dynamite, and he in- tended to blow them off the map if they did not back off and let his men repossess the train. The rebel commander hesitated, th en glumly ordered his men to yield. The Marines manned the train, and as it pulled away, Butler calmly emptied the two bags out of a rear wi ndow in sight of the rebels. They contained sand. Checking a bridge to make sure it wa s safe for the train to cross, be was suddenly confronted by a rebel ge neral with an enormous moustache who whipped out a huge pistol and shoved it against Butler's stomach. If the train moved forward one inch, th e rebel officer yelled to Marines clustered around the locomotive, he would pull the trigger. The slender Marine major suddenly sidestepped, simultaneously tearing the pistol out of the Nicaraguan's hand. Emptying the cartridges out of the barrel, he calmly returned the g un to the crestfallen general and drew his own revolver. The vanquished rebel leader meekly marched back to the train as a hostage, and the train went through. Butler discovered that most Nicaraguans were supporting the rebellion against the Diaz government , which had hired brutal Honduran mercenaries to crush it.

Unfortunately"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The Indispensable Man 55 for American prestige, a few Amer icans had been conspicuous among them. Butler's hundred Marines aboard the train were regarded with general hostility as similarly vicious instruments of the Diaz regime. Butler and his men succeeded in op ening the line between Managua and the port at Corinto. On the wa y back they had to build three new bridges and several miles of track. Ret urning to Managua after a fifteen- hundred-foot descent with the train's brakes gone, Butler collapsed into bed and pulled the covers over his face. During the whole w eek-long trip he had had just seventeen hours' sleep. By now the cynicism of the Amer ican presence in Nicaragua was becoming depressingly obvious to him. \"I expect a whole lot more rot about the property of ci tizens of ours . . . which has been stolen by the rebels and which I must see restored to their owners,\" he wrote his wife on September 13, 1912. The following day he complained of orders from Admiral William H. H. Southerland, who headed the fleet at Corinto, \"virtually changing our status from neutral to partisanship with the government forces.\" He was next ordered to open the ra ilroad south to Granada, Mena's rebel headquarters. Another malaria a ttack delayed the expedition. Always restless and unhappy when il lness forced him to be id le, Butler held ice in his mouth and drove down his temperatur e until the doctor reluctantly let him out of bed. Weak and haggard with 104 ° fever, he had to lie on a cot in a boxcar as his troop train pulled out of Managua. His eyes were so bloodshot and glaring that his men began calling him Old Gimlet Eye, a nickname that stuck. Under constant harassment by guer rilla forces, Butler finally sent word ahead to Gran ada to warn General Mena that the Americans were prepared to attack him if he ordered an y further assaults on the train. Mena replied that he was sending a peace delegation.

Glaring down at them, he warned that unless Mena signed an agreement surrendering the railroad prop erty and moving his troops out of the railroad area, Marine \"regiments \" would attack Mena's two-thousand- man force in Granada. His bluff worked so well that Mena not only agreed but, to Butler's amazement, also offered to surrender himself and his army if the Americans would provide a warship to take him safe ly to exile in Panama. The jubilant Marine major notified Admiral Southerl and and the admiral at once agreed. Butler was made temporary governor of the District of Granada until elections could be held. He promptly released all political prisoners Mena had thrown into dungeons and return ed all the property that had been confiscated from them. He next issued a proclamation orderi ng all loot taken from the people by both rebel and govern ment forces to be restored. The astonished Granadans hailed him as a liberator. On September 30, 1912, Butler wa s dismayed when the admiral transmitted cabled orders from Secretary of the Navy George von L. Meyer to side openly with the Di az regime and turn over to it all captured rebels. Apologetically he disarmed Mena and his troops, c onfining troops, confining them m their barracks under guard. \"I must say,\" he wrote his wife, \"tha t I hated my job like the devil . . . but orders are orders, and of course, ha d to be carried out.\" But he protested bitterly to Admiral Southerland at th e betrayal of his promise to Mena. Southerland finally agreed to stand be hind his pledge and explain to Meyer. Local Granadan politicians, deprived by Butler of their customary loot, loudly complained to the admiral th at he was interfering in local affairs. Southerland felt compelled to relieve him as governor, sending him to crush the final remnants of the revolution. Zeledon's force of two thousand rebels was dug in at a fort on top of the Coya tepe Mountain, a stronghold that had never been taken in Nicar agua's stormy history.

Two Marines were killed. The fall of Coyatepe put the town of Masaya, the last rebel outpost, in Marine hands. As they occupied it, some four thousand government troops celebrated by entering the town, loo ting it, and getting drunk. Incensed, Butler expressed his bitterness in a le tter to his wife, decrying \"a victory gained by us for them at the expe nse of two good American lives, all because Brown Brothers, bankers, have some money invested in this country.\" 6 Resting in Masaya, the major began longing to see his family. \"I feel terribly over missing my son's most interesting period of development, but ... this separation can't last forever,\" he wrote Ethel on Oc tober g. \"I get so terribly homesick at times that I just don't see how I can stand it.\" The Taft Administration had anot her unpleasant assignment for him- rigging the new Nicaraguan elections to ma ke certain that Diaz was returned to power. Checking on the country's election laws, Butler found that the polls had to be open a sufficient length of time (\"at least that's the way we translated it\") and that voters had to register to be able to vote. He ordered a canvass of the di strict to locate four hundred Nicaraguans who could be depende d upon to vote for Diaz. Notice of opening of the polls was given five minutes beforehand. The four hundred Diaz adherents were assemble d in a line, and two hours later, as soon as they had finished voting, the polls were clos ed.

He had a high regard for the Nicaraguan people and genuine co mpassion for their suffering. On November 13, 1912, over five thousand Nicaragu ans turned out in Granada to present him with a go ld medal for saving them from troop disorders and looting. They also ga ve him a scroll signed by Granada's leading citizens, expres sing gratitude for his \"brave and opportune intervention\" that \"put an end to th e desperate and pain ful situation in which this city was placed-victim of all the horrors of an organized anarchy.\" They told him, \"From th is terrible situation and from the anguish that the future held fo r us, we passed as by magi c to a state of complete guarantee for life, property, and well-bei ng for all, as soon as the American hoops entered the city.

Hi s second son, Thomas Richard, was born in October, 1913 . With Woodrow Wilson in the White House, war clouds loomed with Mexico when bandit General Victoria no Huerta overthrew legally elected Mexican President Francisco Madero. In an angry exchange of notes, Wilson insisted that Huerta must hol d new elections barring himself as a candidate. Wilson's choice was Hu erta's rival for power, General Venustiano Carranza. Banning all arms shipments to Mexico, the President asked all Americans withou t urgent business there to leave the country and sent the fleet to cruise si gnificantly in the Gulf of Mexico during a period of \"watchful waiting.\" Defying Wilson, Huerta began impor ting arms from Europe to crush Carranza. The President then violated his own embargo and rushed American arms to the Carranza forces. Full-scal e fighting broke out all over Mexico, during which American in dustrial property was destroyed and United States businessm en were compelled to fl ee attacks against them from both sides. In January, 1914, the Ma rines were ordered from Panama to the fleet standing off Vera Cruz. Ethel Bu tler took the children home to Pennsylvania, and her husband reported to the fleet flagship Florida, assigned to the staff of Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher. Welcoming him aboard, the admiral remarked on his courage and daring in the Chinese, Philippine, and Nicaraguan campaigns. He was just the man, the admiral thought, for a danger ous special mission for the War Department.

Beneath a night sky of swollen black clouds, as most of the crew aboard the Florida watched a Western movie starring Broncho Billy, a civilian-clad Butler droppe d a small traveling bag out of his cabin port into a small boat, then slipped off the ship after it. His disappearance from the Florida was carried on the ship's rolls as \"desertion.\" Ashore in Vera Cruz, he decided to disguise himself as an Englishman. There were many English in Mexico at the time traveling on business. Attiring himself in a tweed suit, spats, deer stalker's hat, and a pair of gold-rimmed glasses with a black ribbon, he undertook a stage English accent. A fraudulent British passport an d forged letters of introduction to important Britons in Mexico Ci ty completed his impersonation. He left Vera Cruz aboard the pr ivate railroad car of the line's superintendent, a secret Carranza supporter cooper ating with the Americans. The train rolled toward Me xico City along th e road American troops would use if they invaded. The superintendent stopped the train several times en route, letting Butl er inspect electric power plants and reservoirs by introducing him to leadin g citizens as \"Mr. Johnson,\" a public utilities expert. Managing to stray in side some army forts on his own, he was apprehended several times but released. \"I carried a butterfly net and studied rocks,\" he grinned in recollection. \"They thought I was a nut and let me pass.\" In Mexico City he changed to Amer ican garb and posed as a private detective from the United States s eeking a condemned murderer who had escaped and fled to Mexi co. Mexican secret police escorted him to all the garrisons to help his search for the imaginary criminal. He soon had vital data on the troop strength and di sposition of munitions dumps around Mexico City. Making military maps of everythi ng he had seen, Butler buried them in the false bottom of hi s bag and took the train back to Vera Cruz. He became aware that two Me xicans were following hi m.

During this pause Butler went to the washroom in pajamas, his bag concealed under his bathrobe. Locking the door behind him, he slipped out of the train window. He donned his clothes in the freight yard, then sped to the American consulate to contact Admiral Fletcher. Two naval officers were sent ashore to the consulate. He turned over all his maps and data to them, then le ft separately, dressed once more in his British guise. Seeking to board a British steamer at the wharf to a port down the coast, from which he would secretly be pick ed up and brought back to the Florida, he was suddenly seized by a squad of police. They considered it odd for a \"Briti sh entomologist\" to have been visiting the American embassy. His baggage was opened and searched thoroughly, but nothing incrimin ating was found. Threatening \"you blighters\" with official reprisals from the British Foreign Office, Butler bluffed them into letting him go. A few days late r he was safely back aboard the Florida, where Admiral Fletcher wa rmly congratulated him on the success of his daring mission. 7 When war with Mexico seemed inevitable, on April 19, 19 1 4, Admiral Fletcher put six companie s of Marines ashore at Vera Cruz under Butler's old friend, Buck Neville, now a colonel. At dawn when the six companies began marching through the city Mexican troops fired at them fr om rooftops and house wi ndows, using m achine guns as well as rifles.

Ignoring bullets spurting dust at his feet, he used the stick to point out snipers to his sharpshooters. By nightfall the Marines had won control of the city, but at a cost of 135 Americans killed or wounded, 7 of the casualties Butler's men. Mexican casualties were four or five times as great. Returning to Panama, Butler re lieved tedious garrison duty by expending his inexhaustible energy in making Camp Elliott an exemplary Marine outpost. After a visit to the Panama Canal Zone, Secretary of War Lindley M. Garrison wrote him, \"I was de lighted . . . to observe the esprit de corps exhibited by your command. Their alertness, skill, and proficiency were models for military organizations.\" Congress had by now authorized o fficers as well as enlisted men to receive Congressional Medals of Honor . One was now awarded to Butler for being \"eminent and conspicuous in co mmand of his Battalion.

He re turned the medal to Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, writing stubbornly, \"I must renew my request that the Department reconsider its action in awarding this decoration.\" The matter was shelved by the outbreak of World War I in August, 1914, but Butler was later pressured into accepting the medal. Wilson was keeping a careful and wo rried eye on Haiti. During 1914 four presidents of that volatile little re public were overthrown. The Germans were threatening to intervene to prot ect their economic interests. Wilson suspected that they wanted to use th e volatile little republic as a naval base, which would put them within easy striking distance of the Panama Canal and the Florida coast. Then in 1915 a new Haitian president, pur sued by an angry mob, was forced to seek sanctuary in the French le gation. The mob dragged him out and killed him. Now the angry French G overnment threatened intervention. Squirming in an agony of indecision, the anti-imperialist Wilson finally decided to put Haiti under American co ntrol to prevent any of the warring European powers from seizing it. Besides, he told Secretary of State R obert Lansing, an American occupation would give him a chance to bring law, or der, democracy, and prosperity to the wretched people of the misruled little country. Wilson's missionary impulse dovetailed neatly with less exal ted plans by big-bus iness interests. The National City Bank controlled the National Bank of Haiti and the Haitian railroad system. Dollar diplomac y also involved the sugar barons who saw Haiti's rich plantations as an inviting target for investment and takeover. Rioting in the capital of Haiti in A ugust, 1915, gave Wilson the excuse he needed to intervene with warships and Marines under Colonel Littleton Waller, Butler's commanding officer.

The government was not allowed to incur any \"foreign obligations \" without American consent, and an American customs official collected all money due Haiti.

When the Haitian National Assembly met in Port-au-Prince, Marines stood in the aisles with bayonets drawn until Philippe Dartiguenave, the Haitian selected by the American minist er, was \"elected\" President by the Assembly. He was the first Haitian Preside nt to serve out his full seven-year term, only because of the occupation of the Marines. Under Dartiguenave Amer ican control of the island was assured by a treaty signed on September 16, 1915, wh ich entitled the United States to administer Haitian customs and finan ce for twenty years, or longer if Washington saw fit. The Haitian c onstitution was revised to remove a prohibition against alien ownership of land, enabling Americans to purchase the most fertile areas in the country, including valuable sugar cane, cacao, banana, cotton, tobacco, and sisal plantations. Northern Haiti, however, remained in the grip of rebels known as Cacos, whose chiefs Dartiguenave labe led bandits. Posing as nationalists, they were actually precursors of the br utal Tonton Macoutes of the later Duvalier regime, just as cruel to the peasants as the government's soldiers were. Butler led a reconnaissance force of twenty-six volunteers in pursuit of a Caco force that had killed ten Mari nes. Like the Cacos in the mountains, he and his men lived for days off th e orange groves. Fo r over a hundred miles they followed a trail of peels, estimating how long before the Cacos had passed by the dryness of the peels. A native guide they picked up helped them locate the Cacos' hea dquarters, a secret fort called Capois, deep in the mountain range.

Only one last stronghold remained to be cleared-the mountain fortress at Fort Riviere, which the French, who had bu ilt it during their occupation of Haiti, considered impregnable. Butler was to ld it would be difficult to capture, even with a strong artillery battery. \"Give me a hundred picked volunteers,\" he said, \"and I'll have the colors flying over it tomorrow.\" 8 Butler earnestly assured his volunteers that they could do the job. His pep talks were enormously pers uasive because they were sincere-so sincere that after he gave one, he w ould often feel emotionally spent and limp. He refused to believe that any job was impossible fo r Marines and frequently hypnotized him self into believing it. Hi s fervor made believers out of his men, who never hesita ted to follow him against overwhelming odds. His officers gave him unreasoning loyalty, even though he was a tough taskmaster and never played fa vorites. One captain, asked to explain his devotion to Butler, said, \"Well, damn him, I don't know.

Butler started to crawl through it (about 2 1/4 ' high x 2' wide) and the old sergeant [Ross lams] said, \"Sir, I was in the Marines before you and it is my privilege.\" Butler recognized his right, and the sergeant crawled through first.

Incidentally, Butler had received the Medal of Honor at Tientsin at the time of the Boxer Rebellion.* He had been awarded at the capture of Vera Cruz in 1914 but declined to accept it. The third at Fort Riviere he did accept. Butler saw pathos as well as bravery in the episode at Riviere. \"The futile efforts of the natives to oppose trai ned white soldiers impressed me as tragic,\" he declared. \"As soon as they lost their heads, they picked up useless, aboriginal weapons. If they had realized the advantage of their position, they could have s hot us like rats as we crawled out one by one, out of the drain.\" But the power of the Cacos was br oken, and the revol ution was over. Surviving Cacos sought to keep the movement alive, but their ancient horse pistols, Spanish cutlasses, Na poleonic sabers, French carbines, and even flintlocks were fu tile against the s uperior weaponry and training of the Marines. President Dartiguenave awarded Butler the Haitian Meda l of Honor, with great praise for his dynamic personality , intense determination, direct and unrelenting attacks against heavy odds, and masterful ability to lead men. Soon after peace was restored, Butler se nt for his wife and children. They had seen little of him since the beginning of his tour in Panama, because of his three expeditions to Nica ragua followed by the Mexican and Haitian campaigns. They joined him at Port -au-Prince in a large, comfortable house with white verandas and a pleasant, shaded garden, located on the outskirts of the town. Sumptuous by island standard s, it nevertheless lacked indoor plumbing, and the family had to share a two-hole privy. A stern taskmaster in the Corps, Butler was a gentle and undemanding father. It was Ethel Butl er who disciplined the children, a matter of necessity because of his frequent absences. The children loved the exotic flavor of the tropical republic. Smedle y, Jr. was sent to an integrated school with Haitian children *Roosevelt's error; officers at the time of the Boxer Rebelli on could not win the Medal of Honor."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 68 The Plot to Seize the White House and a few other white youngsters. Young Ethel went to a convent taught by nuns in French and English. Never allowed into town, as it was considered unsafe, they were accompanied everywhere by a gendarme. One night while the family was seated on the veranda, a Caco concealed somewhere on the hillside took a shot at their father, narrowly missing him. Washington decided to reorganize the ineffective Haitian military, which had almost one general for ever y three privates in its thirteen- hundred-man army. Dartiguenave ag reed to its replacement by a native constabulary of three thousand men to be trained and directed by Butler. Although still only a ma jor, Butler's rank as head of the Haitian Gendarmerie was major general, and hi s power that of Minister of the Interior. He was paid $3,000 a year as commandant of the Gendarmerie, which cost the American Government $800,000 a year. Ostensibly under the direction of the Haitian President, the new force was actually controlled by Washington. All of its officers were Marines. Haiti's foreign minister demanded th at the Gendarmerie be put under Haitian control. Butler refused, pointing out that according to an agreement signed by Dartiguenave, the commanda nt alone was made responsible for the force. The foreign mini ster angrily drew up a ne w constitution for Haiti that would force the Americans to relinquish their power over both the Gendarmerie and Haiti itself, and prep ared to introduce it in the Haitian National Assembly. Alarmed, Dartiguenave told Butler that the foreign minister had the support of a major ity of the Assembly's legisl ators, who intended to ram the new constitution through the Ch amber of Deputies and the Senate. Then they planned to vote to im peach Dartiguenave , ostensibly for violating the old constitu tion, in reality because they cons idered him an American pawn. The American minister, A. Bailly- Blanchard, cabled a warning to Secretary of State Robert Lansing, who cabled b ack that since the new constitution was \"unfriendly\" to the Un ited States, it must not be approved by the Haitian Legislature.

He summoned Butler, Butler's regiment al commander, Colonel Cole, and the top naval commander, Ad miral Anderson, to a conference, and read them Lansing's cable. It was decided that Am ericans would have no legal justification for interfering in Haiti's internal affairs, but that Butler, as major general of the Haitian Constabulary, did have that right. Commanded to carry out the State Department's orders, Butler went to see Dartiguenave, who urged him to use the Gendarmerie to di ssolve the National Assembly. But Butler had no relish for the role of dictator. If Dartiguenave and his cabinet wanted the Assembly suspended, he insisted, then they had to take full responsibility. He refused to act until they had apprehensively signed a decree ordering dissolution of the Assembly \"to end the spirit of anarchy which animates it.\" When Butler led his gendarmes to the National Assembly, he was greeted with loud, prolonged hissing. The gendarmes began cocking their rifles. Many, veterans of previous c oups d'etat, were amazed at Butler's order to lower their guns. He then handed the Pr esident's decree to the presiding Assembly officer to be read aloud to the chambe r. Instead the latter launched into a wrathful tirade against the American occupation. His outburst threw the hall into an uproar. Fearful of being charged, the gendarmes again threw up their weapons, and Butler once more snap ped an order to ground arms.

Winning commendation as a capable admini strator, he kept Haiti stable and at peace for the first time in half a century. He grew fond of Dartiguenave while acknowledging, \"I knew lie was an old political crook.\" Typical of the President's expenditures from the treas ury was sixteen hundred dollars \"to have the hole in a carpet mended.\" Traveling all over Haiti without a gun, despite the Cacos, Butler established a postal service, a country school system, a network of telegraph lines, a civil hospital in Port-au-Pr ince, and a five-hundred-mile road system; he also restored lighthouses and channel buoys. Although these civic and economic improvements unquestiona bly benefited American investors, Butler's primary purpose was to improve life for the Haitians. \"I was, and have been ever since, very fond of the Haitian people,\" he wrote later, \"and it was my ambition to make Haiti a first-class black man's country.\" But no amount of Butler's \"good works\" could erase from Haitian minds the humiliating awareness that they had been robbed of their independence by a military occupation. Haitians had no shortage of legitimate grievances. The supreme pow er on the island was not Butler, who was preoccupied with the Gendarmerie , but the commanding officer of the Marines in Haiti, Littlet on Waller, who was made a brigadier general in the fall of 1916. As the officer who had on ce been court-martialed for brutality toward Filipino natives, he did not in spire among his staff officers any vast respect for Haitian sensibilities. In the interior they talked as casually of shooting \"gooks\" as sportsmen talked of duck-hunting. Patrolling against the Cacos, some Marine officers looted the hom es of native families they"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Indispensable Man 71 were supposed to protect. Others talk ed of \"cleaning out\" the island by killing the entire native population. Prisone rs were beaten and tortured to make them tell what they knew about Cacos' whereabouts. Some were allowed to \"escape,\" then were shot as they fled. Haitians in the interior were forced to carry bon habitant (good citizen) passes. Any native stopped by a Marine and unable to produce a bon habitant could be either shot or arrest ed. Understandably, many Haitians became convinced that all Americans were racial bigots who hated black men. And behind the Americans in uniform were the American businessmen, who plundered the wealth of the island with impunity. Butler, now in his early thirties, di d not take Haitian politicians very seriously. He viewed most of them as banana republic opportunists not too different from the crooked ward bosse s who infested the American body politic. The ingenuity and pretensions of the shrewdest, like Dartiguenave, tickled his sense of humor, but he re garded the Haitian people themselves with respect and affection, if blind to the irony implicit in the presumption to offer superior government to a black republic by a nation that had signally failed to solve its own serious race problem. His eyes opened increasingly, however , to the fact that he was being used by big-business interests to paci fy the population in order to protect profitable American investments. \"The Haitian Government, such as it is, either yields perforce to American pressure,\" reported corre spondent Herbert J. Seligmann in The Nation, \"or finds itself in feeble and ineffectual opposition.... The present Government of Haiti, which dangles from wires pulled by American fingers, would not endure for twenty-four hours if United States ar med forces were withdrawn; and the President, Darti guenave, would face death or exile.\" Butler protested to Washington about some of the injustices of the occupation.

His protest fell on deaf ears. By the spring of 1916 Haitian disc ontent was growing rapidly. Waller warned Butler to be on guard because Cacos, spreading the rumor that the Americans would soon pull out, were ur ging the people to rise and destroy them now. Butler felt deeply discouraged. Despite everything he had tried to do for the people, the dollar sign behind th e occupation had made all his efforts useless. In July he wrote to Lejeune, \"All of us gendarmes are mighty tired, and I for one am going to ask to be relieved at the first opportunity presenting itself.\" In August Waller ordered him into Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic sharing the island with Haiti, to put down a revolt led by Celidiano Pantilion and \"stabilize the economy. \" The Dominican Government had defaulted its obligations to American banks and paid for its sins with an American occupation to protect U.S. i nvestments that lasted eight years. When he returned from Santo Domingo, mission accomplished, a letter was waiting for him from Lejeun e. \"Assistant Secretary Roosevelt came back with glowing accounts of the splendid work being done by the Marine Corps in connection with the Gendarmerie,\" Lejeune wrote enthusiastically. \"You certainly deserv e the greatest credit for what you have done in making a soldier out of the ignorant Haitian.\" But Butler had begun to brood about the virtue of leading American boys into battle, causing some to lose their lives and others to suffer permanent disablement, to protect American business interests in the Caribbean. He grew quietly cynical about some of the compliments paid to him. In neighboring Santo Domingo re volutionists joined bandits in shaking down American plantation mana gers for money. Repulsed, they set cane fires and sought to prevent can e from being cut and ground. The American sugar interests there wanted Butler to come to their rescue once again. \"Members of the Sugar Associati on and myself,\" their spokesman, businessman Frank H.

The dangers from bandit op erations are by no means past or remote.

Spies tipped off Dartiguenave, who grew chilly toward Butler for putting his job in jeopardy. But Haiti received little attention now from the State Department, which was carefully studying developmen ts in World War I. Reading about the war from his remote outpost, Butl er regarded it with loathing as \"madness . . . a European bloodbath.\" He fervently hoped that Wilson would have the good sense to keep American boys out of it. When the President took America into the war, however, Butler instantly appealed to Lejeune for a co mbat assignment in France, where he felt that he would at least be servi ng his country instead of Wall Street. Lejeune replied that the State Departme nt was so pleased with his work as an administrator in Haiti that it had refu sed to transfer him to the European war front. Unappeased, Butler moaned to Lejeune in June, 1917, \"The service is becoming more and more de testable every day, and the knowledge that I am not allowed to fight fo r my country makes it even more unbearable.\" He appealed to Roosev elt. \"Secretary Roosev elt and I,\" replied John McIlhenny, head of the U.S. Civil Serv ice Commission, \"are of the same opinion that the work which you have in hand should not be interfered with or disturbed because it is the most pot ent factor in maintaining a peaceful occupation.\" An entreaty to his father also fa iled to work. \"Your father,\" wrote Representative W.

In forty-five days lie built a new road from Port-au-Prince to Cape Haitien, across twenty-one miles of the roughest, densest tropical country he had ever seen. After he had driven the first car over it, Secretary of State Lansing cabled congratulations. McIlhenny wrote him, \"I think your achievement in building a road from Port-au-Prince to Ca pe Haitien in such a time and at such a cost is a miracle.\" \"Someone has misled you,\" he re plied impatiently, \"concerning my value to this country, and to the aims of the U.S. down here, for I am simply a subordinate to the Chief of the Am erican Occupation . . . and have no independent authority.\" By now Butler was strongly suspicious that he was be ing held in Haiti by the War Department's lack of confid ence in his fitness for a command in France. When he asked a friend in Wa shington to snoop and investigate for him, he was assured that his susp icions were unfounde d: The government was really having trouble finding a competent man to replace him. He still didn't believe it. His instinct s told him that his old enemies in the Navy Department were working against him. He had trodden on a good many other important toes as well during his two years in Haiti, and he had heard rumors spread by some naval offi cers that he had won all his medals and promotions because of his father's influence. He did not hesitate to try to use that influence when Thomas Butler became chairman of the House Nava l Affairs Committee in 1918. But his renewed pleas to be allowe d to serve in the A.E.F. failed to move his father, and he remained bogged down disconsolat ely in Haiti. He grew increasingly unhappy with the government's manage ment of the island's affairs. Under wartime censorship Port -au-Prince's newspapers were suppressed, and their editors jailed, fo r suggesting that since Mr. Wilson was so concerned about the fate of poor little nations overrun by powerful military aggressors that he had gone to war in Europe for them, he might consider rescuing little Haiti from its invaders."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Indispensable Man 75 Some years later when Harding succeeded Wilson in th e White House, Dartiguenave called upon him to remove all Marines from Haiti and liberate the Haitian people. To dramatize his cas e, Dartiguenave accused Butler of having dissolv e d the Haitian National Assembly by force of arms, without authority, conveniently ignoring the f act that he had begged Butler to do it and that he had written him upon his depa rture, “I regret to see you obliged to cease your services in this country , and I was well pleased with the broad and intelligent cooperation that you have constantly given to the Government.\" Dartiguenave's memorial to Hardi ng, published widely in the United States, \"stirred up a hell of a commotion,\" as Butler put it. The Senate appointed an investigating committee with Senator Medill McCormick, of Illinois, as chairman. Butler was summon ed as a witness. A lawyer for the American N.A.A.C.P. demanded to know on what authority he had presumed to dissolve the Haitian National Assembly. \"The President [Dartiguenave] hi mself dissolved the Congress,\" Butler replied. \"I merely carried his decree of dissolution to the Assembly.\" Haitian witnesses jeered at this a ssertion, but their faces fell when Butler produced the decree signed by Dartiguenave and his cabinet; it had been prudently saved among Butler' s memorabilia. The upset Haitian politicians denounced it as a forgery, but were compelle d to acknowledge it as authentic when it was compared with other documents signed by Dartiguenave. His case won, Butler saw no need to embarrass the State Department by also revealing that S ecretary of State Robert Lansing had secretly ordered \"any steps necessary \" to stop the National Assembly from passing an a nti-American constitution. Soon afterward Secretary of the Navy Edwin Denby asked Butler to return to Haiti as High Commissioner w ith a \"civilian fina ncial adviser\" who, Butler knew, would represent Am erican big-business investors and dictate economic policy. He had had enough of letting Wall Street profiteers use the Marines as their private army. He would prefer not to go, he told Denby, and certainly not with any civili an financial adviser. In that case, Denby said coldly, he need not go at all."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 76 The Plot to Se ize the White House In March, 1918, bursting with frustrati on over his inability to get into the action on France's battlefields, Butler deci ded to press the matter personally with Lejeune, who was now a general, during a medical leave to Washington for dentistry. 10 Lejeune finally succeeded in getting hi m detached from Haitian service, but to Butler's dismay, instead of being se nt overseas, he was ordered to take over a swampy new Marine base at Qu antico, Virginia, on the Potomac, thirty miles south of Washington. Here he had to train regiments of raw boots for the front and glumly watch them pull out for France without him. He felt irked with his father for fa iling to use his influence to get him into combat. Thomas Butler had visited the front and had been greatly disturbed by the high casualties of American troops. Smedley wondered whether his father had refused to help him get overseas out of a dread of losing him in the European carnage. He persisted in nagging Marine headquarters for an overseas command, but his refusal to be discr eet even now antagonized his superior officers. Learning that a move was af oot to raise the rank of the Marine commandant to lieutenant general, he spoke out against it as a rank piece of opportunism. No similar promotions we re being suggested, he pointed out acidly, for the leathernecks in the trenches of France. His friends in the Corps moaned at this bull-in-a-china-shop gaffe, warning him that his indiscreet candor was hurting his career.

Meeting his father, Butler persuaded Daniels, Sr., that young Marines like his son needed the protection overseas of veteran Mari ne commanders like Smedley Butler. Despite the opposition of the desk ad mirals in Washington, Butler was finally ordered overseas with the regiment. Bidding farewell to his family, Butler was happy in the conviction that he was heading for the front at last. Fo r twenty years, he told his wife, he had been preparing for the big war that he had dreaded, yet had anticipated. At last he would be serv ing his country in its great est hour of crisis. In his patriotic zeal his qualms about the co mmercial intrigues he had learned to suspect behind troop movements were swept away. Anchoring at Brest on September 24, 1918, he and his men were assigned to a dreary Army debarkati on center, Camp Pontanezen, consisting of seventeen hundred acres of mud flats occupied by 75,000 American soldiers, of whom 16,000 had the flu. Returning casualties had complained of scandalous conditions at Pontanezen, where they had been forced to await ships home lying in mud, hungry, chilled, and medica lly neglected. Day after day he waited impatiently fo r his orders to move up to the fighting zone. After two weeks he was handed a telegram from A.E.F. Commander General John J. Pershing informing the thirty-seven-year-old Butler that he had been promoted to the rank of brigadie r general, making him the youngest Marine ever to achie ve that rank.

To make matters worse, he discove red that one officer after another had been put in charge of the misera ble concentration camp and pest trap that was now his responsibility, only to fail dismally in their attempts to clean it up.

Bitter, he added Pershing to his list of enemies in top echelons. Pershing, actually, had been motiv ated only by the desperate need for a good administrator who could do something about the mess at Pontanezen, the linchpin for troops and equipment coming into France and for wounded and sick troops going home. Butler's record as an able administrator in Haiti and Quantico ha d marked him as the man for the job. So he was forced to watch glumly as the 1 3th Marines left for the front, leaving him behind in command of an all-Army outfit in Brest. Shaking off his despond and self-p ity, Butler went to work. Not long afterward writer Mary Roberts Ri nehart arrived with orders from Secretary of War Newton Baker to in vestigate the terrible conditions at Pontanezen. Touring the camp talking to the troops, she was astonished to find morale high. One private told her enthusiastically, \"I'd cross hell on a slat if Butler gave the word!\" She wrote later: In charge of the camp was that dynamo of energy, courage and sheer ability, General Smedley Butle r of the Marines. And Butler was no red tape man. In defiance of regulations he was issuing double rations of food, and serving hot soup all day long to those who needed it. He had issued, also, six blanke ts to each man, and as the ground under the tents was nothing but mud, he had raided the wharf at Brest of the duck-boards no longer needed fo r the trenches, carried the first one himself up that four-mile hill to the camp, and thus provided something in the way of protection for the men to sleep on. To have produced the morale I found under existing conditions was nothing short of a miracle of ab ility, and I said so. Even the flu, taking its daily toll of men in th e hospital nearby, was practically non- existent in the camp. . . . I had neve r seen General Butler before, and I went prepared to send in a blisteri ng report to Washington. . . . But the men were in fine condition, and cheerful.

Every man back from the front was deloused, bathed, and freshly dr essed and equipped within twenty- four hours. The camp wa s the outstanding marvel of American efficiency on French soil, During an inspection visit by Pershing, the commander of the A.E.F. noticed that as Butler dr ove him around the camp, doughboy after doughboy failed to salute them. Irked, he snapped to Bu tler, \"Don't you think they should be taught to salute?\" \"Well, General,\" Butler said with a shrug, \"if the Army had them from six months to six years and they haven't learned to salute, you can't expect a Marine to teac h them in six days!\" He was always on the side of th e powerless against the brass. One day while he was absent his superior, General Helm ick, made a surprise inspection of Pontanezen. Finding wa stefulness in one mess, Helmick savagely tongue-lashed the lieutenan t in charge. When Butler learned about it, he phoned the Army Chief of Staff. \"If the general has any complaint w ith the camp,\" he stormed, \"tell him to pick on me and not on a young lieutenant who is doing his level best!\" When Helmick came to see hi m, Butler pounded on the desk and told his superior what he thought of him for \"jumping on a boy.\" After Butler's angry outburst ha d subsided, Helmick replied, \"Now, Smedley, I'll talk. I've le t you abuse me, your commander, for two reasons. First, because you've be en of such tremendous value to my organization, and second, because I know I didn't do the right thing by that boy. I realize also that you've worked yourself into a state of nervous collapse to make the camp a success. I know you don't mean what you're saying. I never permit myse lf to be aroused by a tired man's utterances, when that tired man is a good man.\" \"General, by God,\" Butler said hoars ely, struck with admiration, \"you are some commander!\" Helmick then went with Butle r to the young lieutenant and apologized to him publicly in fr ont of all the cooks and KP's."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"80 The Plot to Seize the White House Torn between court-martialing hi m for his frequent intransigence toward higher authority and decorating him for his accomplishments in an almost impossible job, the Army finally awarded him its Distinguished Service Medal.

The humdrum garrison life of peacetime, with no alarums and excursions to divert him, took its toll of Butler's temper. \"I was itching for a scrap-action-something with a sn ap to it,\" he admitted later. But he was never irascible in any matter that pertained to ailing Marines who had served under him. In A ugust, 1920, a private wrote him, \"I have been a patient in St. Elizabeth's hospital for the Insane since Sept. 20, 1918. I am writing to ask if you will arrang e to have me tran sferred to one of the institutions in Philadelphia, so that I can be close to the folks at home.\" \"I will look into the matter and le t you know,\" Butler replied gently. \"You can be assured that everything will be done for"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"82 The Plot to Seize the White House your comfort, for you are one of the prize soldiers of the Marine Corps, and we all like you very much.\" He grew increasingly incensed at what he considered the in- gratitude of the nation toward its ve terans. Once the war crisis was over and Americans felt safe, he reflected, the shattere d heroes of yesterday were ignored as the \"bums\" of today. He was particularly embittered by the indifference of big business towa rd the men in uniform who had so often been called upon to spi ll blood for corporate profits. The profiteering of the Pennsylva nia Railroad in the price they charged for transporting troops led hi m to write his father angrily, \"I am at a loss to understand why th e Pennsylvania people are so antagonistic to men in uniform. The railroad can haul civilians from Washington to Philadelphia a nd back every Sunday for $3.78 and want $14.00 to haul soldiers. . . . Thes e Pennsylvania people are a lot of damned hogs and I hope that so mething will happen to them.\" Butler raised Marine Corps mora le by developing a great football team that became the ta lk of the spor ts world, and began building a sports stadium with volunteer Marine la bor and with cement contributed by cem ent companies. Proliferating veterans' groups vied with each other for the distinction of adding his name to th eir letterheads. He tactfully declined invitations to join, offering his vi ew that all such groups \"must be nonpolitical, and should never be h eard on the floors of Congress.\" In June, 1923, he sent regrets to the Marine Corps Veterans Association explaining, \"I have very decided views on associations, and I am not a member of any but the American Legion, and mo st inactive, at that- only joining it because General Leje une requested me to do so.\" He considered the Legion too political and undemocratic, with leaders who used it as a mouthpiece fo r big-business interests. Late in 1923 Butler's career took an unorthodox twist. W. Freeland Kendrick, the new ma yor of Philadelphia, urged him to take a leave from the Marines to become the city 's Director of Public Safety. The job was that of a \"supercop,\" in char ge of the police and firemen, with the task of smashing the links between cr ime and politics in Philadelphia."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The Indispensable Man 83 Under Prohibition the city had b ecome one of th e most corrupt municipalities in the country. Ov er eight thousand places sold bootleg liquor without fear of prosecution; gangsters ran wide-open gambling joints and brothels; robberies, hold ups, and other crimes were soaring. All attempts to clean up the City of Brotherly Love had failed because of a profitable alliance among gangst ers, speakeasy operators, and crooked ward bosses, who bribed and controlled the police. Kendrick, a conservative Republi can politician, ha d been elected mayor on a law-and-order campaign an d was now under heavy pressure to keep his pledge. He was advised to bring in an outsider, preferably a military man, who could not be bought, bluffed, or bullied, to head the police. Brigadier General Smedley Butler, now a vigo rous forty-two and a colorful war hero with an impressive list of credits in Who's Who in the Services, seemed a perfect choice to please the voters. He had even had police experience orga nizing the Haiti Gendarmerie. But Butler declined the job. On November 21 he wrote Kendrick, \"While this position woul d appeal to me very gr eatly if I believed there were the slightest chance of success, I am convinced that the present political conditions existi ng would ... throw away the work of a lifetime in a perfectly hopeless undertaking.\" He was relieved when the Navy or dered him to report for orders to the Scouting Fleet. But Kendri ck and the Republican party of Pennsylvania now needed him desperately to st ill a storm of public criticism. So Kendrick, Congressman Bill Vare, and Pennsylvania's two senators went to the White Hous e to plead with President Calvin Coolidge that Butler be given a year 's leave of absence to clean up Philadelphia. Only a man with Butler's reputa tion for total honesty, and the ability to discipline me n while capturing their imagination and winning their loyalty, they told Coolidge , could reorganize the Philadelphia police force.

His reluctant consent brought wondering letters from old comrades all over the world, many of whom imagin ed that he had resigned from the Corps. Butler assured them that it was only temporary. \"This job is a terrible one and I will probably be cut to pieces,\" he wrote to Lieutenant Colonel H. L. Roosevelt in Paris. \"On January 7 I will be sw orn in as a Philadelphia cop, for better or worse.\" 12 Butler told a reporter for the Philadelphia North American, \"Kendrick has his neck in a noose with me. If I fall or I am run out, lie is going to go down also. If he reverses me just once I'll quit, and the resignation will be in the form of a telephone call te lling him I am on my way back to Quantico, and that the ke ys to my office are on my desk. I do not care whether the state laws or city ordinanc es are right or wrong. From January 7 they are going to be enforced.\" He was not opposed to drinking in principle, he added. What was at st ake was enforcement of the law, pure and simple, not the ethics of Prohibition. Even before he took office, \"Boss\" Vare sent an emissary to him, Judge Edwin O. Lewis, to offer Vare 's \"suggestions\" for key appointments in reorganizing the police department . None too politely, Butler made it clear what Lewis and Vare co uld do with their suggestions. He rented a home in nearby Overbrook, but his wife and children seldom saw him there because he spen t seven days a w eek on the job, working until after midnight.

It was dramatic and impressive, and meant to be. He promptly summoned all poli ce inspectors to his office. \"I want the lieutenants in your forty-two district s to clean up in forty- eight hours,\" he snapped, \"or face imme diate demotion. That is all.\" Then he visited each one of the districts until he had sp oken to every man on the force. The new motto, he announced, wa s short and sweet: \"C lean up or get out!\" In his first week on the job he ra ided and shut down 973 liquor and gambling joints, without even warnin g Mayor Kendrick. Philadelphians were electrified. The police winked at each other, convinced that Butler was a smart \"gra ndstander\" who would make a big splash for the headlines, th en quiet down and take it easy. Vare would see to that. Going night after night with only a few hours' sleep, he pressed his raids and inspections relentlessly. He demanded from his men a dedication to duty equal to his own, but many of them, cut off from former sources of graft, were hostile and resistant to the new broom sweeping too clean. \"Sherman was right about war,\" Bu tler sighed w earily, \"but he should have tried leading the Philade lphia police!\" Nevertheless he began to show results. Worried Philadelphia bootleggers began unloading their stocks at cut prices. Many crooks and gamblers began streaming out of the city in search of mo re hospitable territory. Encouraging excessive zeal among his forces, Butler took re- sponsibility for po lice who went too far on raid s by using axes freely to destroy furniture and fixtures, sear ching private home s and vehicles on suspicion, and closing pr emises that had a right to stay open to sell nonintoxicating beverages. Magistrate s began refusing to issue search warrants to permit police to enter known speakeasies masquerading as private residences. Many cas es were dismissed on gr ounds of insufficient or illegal evidence.

I must admit that I ha ve sinned in this latter respect more than any of you, and the only excuse I have to offer is that I was unduly excited and enthusiastic.\" Such candor won the affection and respect of reporters, who found Butler colorful copy and loved to join him for midnight suppers on Chestnut Street. There was never any question he would not answer for them directly and honestly. But if they were for him, their publishers-with the exception of the Philadelphia Record-were not; their ed itorial pages sought to ridicule and discredit him relentlessly, \"They insisted on treating me like a queer animal from the circus,\" Butler related. \"My chance re marks were twisted and di storted to paint me in the worst light. . . . About fifty of th e minor officials and correspondents of the newspapers became my loyal frien ds, but they had no influence in shaping the editorial point of view.\" By March angry Republican ward l eaders were furious at Butler for disrupting their network of police contro l. They vigorously applauded City Treasurer Thomas J. Watson at a mee ting when he shouted, \"This country, as well as the Republican organization, would be a hell of a sight better off without Butler!\" The Philadelphia City Council closed ranks against him. \"My foolish notion that the laws of our country applied to rich and poor alike accounted for the growing f eeling of antipathy toward me,\" he recalled later, adding, \"By the end of 1924 I had been cussed, discussed, boycotted, lied about, lied to, strung up, and reviled. Seve ral times I was on the point of resigning. The only reason why I continued in my unpopular and uncomfortable position was to see what the hell was going to happen next!\" Try as he might, he was unable to br eak the power of the ward bosses. In April he was forced to admit th at be had been doub le-crossed by about half of his police lieutenants, who ha d bowed to ward-boss pressure to permit shuttered saloons, gambling ho uses, and speakeasies to reopen.

In an"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" The Indispensable Man 87 attempt to destroy the power of the wa rd bosses, Butler now cut the stations down from forty-six to thirty-three. Infuriated politicians, racketeers, and realtors, who hated him for having cost them the rents of fifteen hundred closed brothels as well as the income from other illegally operated properties, joined forces to demand that Kendrick fire him. But nearly five thousand church c ongregations adopted resolutions in July demanding that the mayor give full support to the genera l. Added to this pressure were thousands of lette rs from women's clubs, civic groups, business organizations, and individuals . Kendrick, alarme d at being caught between the voters and the brokers of power, wavered back and forth. A report that he was preparing to knuckle under to the political bosses brought another roar of protest from the citizenry. A mass meeting of four thousand Philadelphians resolved that Butler must be kept in office: \"Since General Butler has been in command he re, more has been accomplished for the suppression of vice and crime than in any period of like duration in this city!\" They flooded Secretary of th e Navy Curtis D. Wilbur with letters urging that Butler's leave of abse nce from the Marines be extended for another three years. President Calvin Coolidge reluctantly agreed to extend the general's leave for one more year, but he pointed out to the citizens of Philadelphia that the Federal Government could not continue indefinitely to be responsible for solutions to local problems: \"The practice of detailing officers of the United States military forc es to serve in civil capacities in the different states on leaves of absence is of doubtful propriety and should be employed only in cases of emergency. . . . Local self-government cannot be furnished from the outside.\" Reappointed, by the end of the year Butler had raided almost 4,000 speakeasies, shutting down 2,566, a nd had seized over a thousand stills, arresting 10,000 violators of the Volst ead Act. But to hi s dismay, political pressure in the court system resulted in only 2,000 indictments by the grand jury, with only 300 convictions.

When the pe ople of Philadelphia or any other city stop playing the game of `Enforce the la w against others but not against me,' they will begin to win the fight against lawlessness.\" He was bitter when he learned of a secret deal between the brewers of Philadelphia and the Republican Stat e Campaign Committee. A royalty of two dollars for each barrel of illegal beer distributed was to be paid into the Republican campaign fund, provided the politicians put the White House under heavy pressure to recall Bu tler to duty with the Marines. Toward the end of 1 9 2 5, whether this deal was responsible or not, Coolidge refused to extend Butler's leav e. The general was ordered to report after the first of the year to command th e Marine post at San Diego. With his recall assured, Mayor Ke ndrick now shrewdly sought to make points with pro-Butler voters by declaring that he wished it were possible to keep the general as Director of Public Sa fety for the remainder of his own administration. A \"Keep Butler\" movement sprang up all over Philadelphia. Forced to go along with it, Kendrick told one mass meeting, \"To announce that General Butler is to leave his post here would be tantamount to inviting an army of criminals to Philadelphia.\" Bu t the mayor lost no time in grooming his successor. Meanwhile Butler had become increasingly irked by the fact that the pressure of powerful hotels and the Hotel Association had kept their ballroom social affairs, at which liquor was served to young teen-age girls from socially prominent Philadelphia fa milies, from being raided for liquor violations. Ordering a raid on a formal ball at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, he seized evidence showing that bootleg liquor was being served.

Politicians we re threatened with a wholesale withdrawal of campaign contributions unless Butler was now unceremoniously dumped. Greatly upset , Kendrick urged him to \"lay off\" the big hotels. To the mayor's horror, Butler firmly announced his intention to organize a special police squad in evening clothes to invade all Philadelphia hotels, and signal for ra ids whenever they found liquor-law violations. His fighting spirit was now thoro ughly aroused. Although he longed to get back to his beloved Marine Co rps, it rankled him to leave a mission incomplete. If he left Philadelphia no w, he would have enforced the law against small operators who bootlegge d liquor to the poor, but not against the big operators who made it available to the rich. His egalitarian nature pressed him to balance the scales. He also felt an obligation to the hone st cops who had defied the ward bosses to support his fight against corr uption. Once he was gone, he feared, they would be punished for their loyalty to him. He decided that he owed it to them to sacrifice his career in the Marine Corps to stay on and finish the job, especially since Kendrick had ma de it clear-or so Butler believed-that he needed and wanted him. The morning papers carried the story that Butler was resigning from the Marine Corps to remain as Director of Public Safety. Appalled, the hotel owners of the city joined with local politicians in a demand that Kendrick fire Butler immediately. The ma yor was reminded that the Hotel Association's cooperation with City Ha ll was absolutely essential for the success of a sesquicentennial celebrati on of American independence being planned for Philadelphia. Worried and upset, Kendrick called Butl er to his office and told him, \"I don't want any resigned generals ar ound me. You ought to go back to the Service where you belong.

In choice Marine language, Butler told Kendrick exactly what he tho ught of him. Clear ing his desk, the general withdrew a blue-steel Army Colt .q5 from it and inserted it in a holster engraved, \"To General Smed ley D. Butler from W. Freeland Kendrick.\" \"Give him this letter of resignation and the pist ol,\" he told his aide. \"He can publish the letter an d he can do what he pl eases with the gun.

I am being dismi ssed from publ ic service because I am making the greatest sacrifice any Marine can make, and I should, withou t any other ties, be of more service to the City of Philadelphia than I wa s before.\" He had been fired, he charged, because \"the gang that has ruled Philadelphia for many years\" had been out to get him, and did. The Philadelphia Record; which had consistently supported Butler during his two years as the city's su percop, declared, \"H e was honest; that was taken for granted or he would not have been appointed. But he was 100 percent honest. We think we are doing the mayor no injustice in expressing the belief that this was a little more th an he had counted on.\" Reviewing his experience in Philadelp hia, Butler declar ed ironically, \"The fact the mayor didn't know me led to my being chosen.

He replaced the old roundsman, fat and portly, with young and active men, and then he put into them something of the marine esprit de corps. He put the fear of God into the gamblers and dive keepers. He cut down the enorm ous graft which they had paid year after year. But they were only waitin g. They could affo rd to wait. When Butler lost the front page they would come back.... I watched Butler and admired him; the same sheer ability, energy and knowledge of men whic h had succeeded at Bres t were evid ent in all that he did. But it was an unbeatable game, that of the crooks, gamblers, bootleggers and dive keepers. As soon as he was fired, the mayor of Syracuse, New York, sent him a wire urging him to head that city 's new Committee of Public Safety. But now Commandant John Lejeune quickly insisted that he withdraw his resignation from the Corps. \"I told General Butler that I coul d not with equanimity contemplate his leaving the Marine Corps,\" his old friend told the press. \"I have the highest regard for General Butler wi th whom I have served for twenty- seven years, and I don't want the Ma rine Corps to lose him.\" Butler was given a holiday leave with his family to his old hom e in West Chester for a \"quiet, old-fashioned, jolly Christmas\" before reporting to take over the San Diego Naval Operating Base. On the eve of his departure Philadelphia Record reporter Paul Comly French and other newsmen who admire d his honesty and courage gave him an informal midnight dinn er.

In December, 1926, he wrote his father angrily, \"I do not suppose thee or the other men who are responsible for this Government have ever stopped to think what these $20 a month men arc doing towards the preservation of the dignity of this Government.

The governme nt was wrong, he finally decided, in trying to legislate morality. In view of his fame as a stern enforcer of Prohi bition, prudence suggested that he keep his changed views to himself. He was unpopular enough with the wets; to speak out now against the Volstead Act would only alienate millions of drys who considered him one of their knights in white armor. But popularity had never been as important to Smedley Butler as his compulsion to blurt out the truth in public and to kick sacred cows in th e rump when they loitered in the path of justice. On January 7, 1927, in Washington, D.C., he gave the reporters a story that flashed from coast to coast. The Volst ead Act, he now declared, was \"a fool dry act, impossible of enforcement.\" It was, furthermore, \"class legislation,\" because the ri ch could avoid it and the poor could not. The sensational denunciation of Prohibition by one of its leading Republican crusaders plunged the dr y forces of the nation into consternation. Democrats, rejoicing, began laying plans to make repeal of the Volstead Act one of the key issues in th e presidential campaign of 1928. Butler's presence in Washington was occasioned by the outbreak of a fresh crisis in China. To his de light, Lejeune informed him that lie would soon be headed overseas once more at the head of a combat brigade. 14 China was being torn by civil war between Chiang Kai-shek, commander in chief of the new Nati onalist armies of the South, and northern warlords led by Cha ng Tso-lin.

As Chiang Kai-shek's fo rces fought their way north and battles broke out between his army and Chang Tso-lin' s, panic swept foreign residents in the North. American missionarie s and businessmen appealed to Washington for protection. The forty-six-year-old decorated hero of the Boxer Campaign who had helped relieve the sieges of Ti entsin and Peking was made commander of a new Marine expeditionary force- the 3d Marine Brigade. His orders were \"to protect the lives and property of our Nationals in Tientsin; to offer temporary refuge in Tientsin fo r our Nationals; evacuation from the Interior and to make safe evacuation to the sea.\" The War Department warned Butle r to be extremely prudent in anything he did or said; the smallest error of judgment on his part might have disastrous consequences in the highly volatile situ ation. Not without good reason, Lejeune added some prudent parting advice: \"Be careful to avoid talking to newspaper correspondents.\" He arrived in Shanghai on March 25, 1 9 2 7, to find tension running high. Chinese troops had attacked several consulat es at Nanking, killing many foreigners, looting and burning the city. American businessmen and missionaries had escaped on gunboats to Shangha i, whose port was now swarming with ships. Never before in history had the war vessels of so many different nations anchored together in one harbor. Barbed-wire entanglements had been erected, and th e International Settlement was under martial law. All legations had ordered their nationals from the interior of China, from whic h there were daily reports of murders and outrages. A more violent version of the Boxer Rebellion seemed in the making, and the white settlements were gravely apprehensive.

Now if you don't care to take my advice, and some Americans are murdered in this town, a nd you sit quietly here wi th half of the Marines available in the United St ates doing nothing but gu arding coal piles, you will be held responsible!\" The admiral glared at him, but not without an aspect of respect. He was soon one of Butl er's chief admirers. Careful to keep the American forces from getting involved in the fighting between the rival Chinese armies, Butler sought to maintain cordial relations with th e Chinese people themselv es. He had no stomach for any more Haiti-style intervention s that would jockey him into the position of defending Am erican business interests against native rebels, and he did not intend to ri sk a single Marine's life to get the job done he had been sent to China to do, unle ss it became absolutely necessary. Military leaders of other nation s sought to organize a punitive expedition against the Kuomintang for the Nanking uprisi ng. To Butler's relief, Admiral Williams refused to have anything to do with the scheme, although it had the enthus iastic endorsement of th e American minister at Shanghai. On May 31 Butler wrote Lejeune, \"N ow for a little ‘s ecret stuff.’ The American Minister ... is a nervous wreck .

He feels discredited because our Government has not adopted his plan, which meant an invasion of China, follow ed by intervention and military Government, and is desirous of going home on leave to explain his side to the President with a hope of favorable action.\" He later observed, \"I held to the principle that the Chinese had to settle their own form of gove rnment and pick out their own"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"96 The Plot to Seize the White House rulers.

Not too clear about the mission expected of him, he wrote his father asking for clarifica tion. His father replied: I do not think that anyone knows our State policies concerning the situation in China. I do not believe there are any....I have but one word of caution to give thee; do not hurt a Chinaman unless it is absolutely necessary in order to protect the life of Americans in China or other foreigners associated with them.

The Congress will never permit the use of its military to permanently protect it. Following this advice, he persiste ntly reminded his men that they were there to keep the p eace, not violate it. Any Marine who laid a hand on a ricksha coolie would be court-ma rtialed, he warned, urging them to win goodwill for the Corps by friendly behavior. He himself cultivated the friendship of the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs and was invited to over twenty Chinese banquets.

He shared the detestation of the Chinese people for the warlords and their troops, expressing his sympathy with the people in a letter to Lejeune: There is a movement out here which is gaining great headway and is being conducted by a society known as the \"Red Spears.\" Their aims and policies are similar to t hose of the Boxers in 1900 and is causing considerable uneasiness on the part of our people.

I am on the si de of the \"Red Spears\" and it may be this will be a good way to end th is pathetic slaught ering of innocent people by a lot of brutal war-lords. The troops of other nations in the International Settlement marched around their perime ter defenses to intimidate the warlords and discourage any thought of attack. Af ter flexing his muscles to impress them similarly at first, Butler then discreetly sought to \"keep in the background as much as possible, and not in any way behave like an army of occupation-more like a fire company, ready to spring out to the rescue of our people, behaving simp ly as rescue squads.\" 15 On November 5, 1927, his wife, havi ng left the children in San Diego, arrived in Tientsin and joined him in a small hotel next to a godown where the Marines had been quarter ed during the Boxer fighting and where he had been carried when he was wounded in the leg. China’s civil war had quieted down for the moment. In a report from Shanghai Colonel Henry Davis wrote Butler: I had dinner last night with Ge neral Chiang Kai-shek. How in the name of God he ever exercised the control over th ese people to the extent he did last summer is a mystery to me. Usually a man of strong character will demonstrate it in some way without ever speaking a word.

He looks like a stupid ricksha coolie and grunts like a pig when spoken to."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"The Indispensable Man 99 By the end of December Butler f ound himself in a financial bind and complained to his father of th e struggle to get along on a brigadier general's pay of $530 a m onth, out of which he had to pay income tax and \"maintain an establishment for Snooks [daughter Ethel] and Tom Dick in the United States, and send To mmy [Smedley, Jr.] thru college, to say nothing of supporting Bunny [wife Ethel] and myself here in China.\" He added, \"I mu st entertain many, due to ' my official position, and I must pay for the little entert ainment out of my own pocket.\" His father consoled him with the reflection that although he might be better off financially if he we re home with no challenge to his abilities, \"thee would rot and the world would have been no better because thee happened to live in it.\" Lejeune wrote him that at special ceremonies on December 7, with the Secretary of the Navy present, Lejeune had accepted the bronze tablet honoring Butler, presented by a committee of Philadelphia's grateful citizens, and it had been put up in the Navy Building in Washington. He also revealed that Thomas Butler was leading the fight in the House for a larger naval defe nse force, but the public was in a budget-cutting mood. Butler wrote his father: Thy courage in advocating something which will cost money fills me with pride. Our people are all gluttons and their desire to hoard money is so great that they will probably turn on thee and beat thee to death. It would probably be a good thing for our nation if we were to get a good trimming sometime, and perhaps they would learn that there is more in this world than unnecessarily fat bank accounts. The amount of money wasted by five rich men in America in one year would be sufficient to build and maintain a navy capable of preserving our position as a world power. The day before Christmas, 1927, the Standard Oil plant on the outskirts of Tientsin caught fire dur ing a battle between the rival Chinese armies. Nine minutes after the alar m, Butler was leading a battalion of Marines to battle the blaze, utiliz ing fire-fighting experience he had gained as Director of Public Safety"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"100 The Plot to Seize the White House in Philadelphia. He arrived on the scene to find two huge warehouses blazing, with a warehouse fi lled with gasoline twen ty feet away and six 3- million-gallon oil tank s close by. If they ex ploded, the death and devastation in Tientsin would be horrendous. Putting in a call for anot her thousand Marines, he fought furiously to contain the fire. They built a sixteen- foot wall of earth, empty drums, doors, and anything else that wouldn't burn between the blazing warehouses and the stores of gas, and had the fire under control by nightfall. But at 3:00 A.M. the main drain of the plant blew up, showering the river with a stream of burning o il. They worked through Christmas Day building a bulkhead around the mouth of the drain, only to have ice floes carry off part of it. The river flam ed again, threatening the foreign compound on the opp osite shore. They fought the confla gration for four days before Butler succeeded in bringing it under control. On New Year's Eve he wrote his fa ther, \"It was a glorious fight and has done a great deal to weld this command together. ... Everybody in Tientsin and Peking is hi ghly pleased with the magnificent showing of our men.\" Standard Oil estimated their loss at a million dollars but thanked Butler for having saved them four milli on more. At the height of the blaze the admiring official in charge of the company's Tientsin holdings had vowed to donate twenty thousand dollars toward a recreation hall for the Marines. Once the fire had been brough t under control, however, Butler heard no more of the promise. He was disgusted with the company but on principle did not remind them. When he told Smedley, Jr., about it, his outraged son swore never to use a tank of Esso gas in his car for the rest of his life, and kept his word. Butler began having dark thoughts once more about the use of Marines to defend big-business prof its overseas. Was the government's professed concern for the protection of Americans in China during the civil war the real reason for the presence of the Marines? Or was it to defend the properties of Standard Oil and ot her big American corporations? Serving under him in China was Da vid M.

Everything I saw in Tientsin in dicated that he was a helluva showman, too, but a good warrior in the service of his country.\" The author questioned General Shoup about the Marines' mission in China in 1927-1928 \"I would say it wa s pretty hard to say who we were supporting there,\" he repl ied. \"It was just our pr esence there that was the thing. I heard no solid r eason for why we were be ing sent; we were just told we were going to fi ght the Chinese. We didn' t know what the mission was. But we landed at the Standard Oil docks and lived in Standard Oil compounds and were ready to prot ect Standard Oil's investment. I wondered at the time if our government would put all these Marines in a position of danger, wher e they might sacr ifice their lives in defense of Standard Oil. Later I discovered that of course it would, and did. It was only some years later that I learned that General Butler had been thinking the same way. I thought I had been alone in suspecting it.\" 16 All through 1928 Butler nevertheless carried out his orde rs scrupulously and prevented a shot from being fired in anger. In March he wrote his father that he was wary of involvement with any ot her power represented in China because of his suspicion of their selfish interests: The Japanese are most anxious to co ntrol all of North China, particularly Manchuria, and will sa crifice anything and back anyone who will assure to them this control. . . .

Deeply worried, he wrote Thomas Butler in April: I do so hope . . . thee will not run thy legs off for this fool Navy. The American people never do know what they want and it is up to a few men like thee to guide them and persuade them to do the right thing but, after all . . . thy children think more of thy health than all the ships afloat. . . . We are so wholly controlled by selfish capital . . . abetted by foolish, short- sighted but no doubt well-meaning pacifists. We can never hope to be prepared for an emergency and sooner or later will suffer. That was the last communication be tween them. His father died on May 26, 1928. When the news reache d him in Tientsin, Butler wept. He was so stunned by the loss of the father who had been as much confidant and friend as parent that six weeks later he wrote his mother, grieving: Father always took pride in the fa ct that I was ever to be found at the front, and now, though it is simply killing me, I must go on and on trying to do the Nation's work.

Storms having washed away a bridge on the Tientsin- Peking main road in September, he ordered the Marines to build a temporary structure out of scrap lumber to keep the highway open. The delighted villagers urged him to allo w the bridge to remain; instead he magnified Chinese-American goodwill by building a more permanent bridge for them. Chines e officials named it after him and made him an honorary Chinese citizen. He then offe red to rebuild the whole road from Peking to Tientsin with Marine equi pment, to make it suitable for motor use, if they would supply soldier la bor. They happily provided fifteen hundred Chinese troops for the job, wh ich he personally supervised. The Chinese peasants were grateful for th e road and bridges that helped them get their fresh produce to market. When the road was officially ope ned, the governor of the province held a celebration at which Butle r was the guest of honor. Ancient Chinese custom decreed that when th e citizens of a town or district unanimously voted a man to be a gr eat public benefactor, he could be awarded an Umbrella of Ten Thous and Blessings-a magnificent canopy of red satin with small silk stre amers proclaiming his greatness. No foreigner in Tientsin or Peking ha d ever rated one. But now the people of Tientsin presented a Blessings Umbrella to Smedley Butler. Soon afterward he drove into Boxert own just as a detached column from Chiang Kai-shek's army advanced into the opposite end of the town to loot it. His car kicked up so much racket that it sounded like machine- gun fire. The Nationalists, thinking he had an army behind him, fled. Despite Butler's protests that he had do ne nothing at all to help them, the people of Boxertown hailed him as a deliverer. When he received a second Blessings Umbrella with its silk streamers inscribed in Chinese, one banner read, \"Your kindness is always in the minds of people.\" The other: \"General Butler loves China as he loves America.\" The second award moved him deep ly, because Boxertown was the very same town from which Boxers , twenty-eight years earlier, had poured fire on his company, killing three Marines and wounding nine.

He was equally popular with his me n, frequently working beside them when there was physical labor to be d one. Junior officers were so caught up by his gung-ho leadership, General Shoup recalled, that they, too, worked voluntarily beside the enlisted men. \"N ever before or since,\" one of them said later in awe, \"have I ever known a general who could actually inspire officers to want to do physical labor.\" In the fall of 1928 Butler followed developments by radio in the presidential race between Herbert Hoove r and A1 Smith, deeply interested in the campaign issues that touched tw o facets of his personal experience- Prohibition and Latin American relatio ns. He wrote Lejeune in October, \"There seems no doubt that Hoover w ill be elected President-I guess, however, the country will survive.\" Orders for the Marines to begi n pulling out of China came from President Coolidge in Decem ber. As he left China in January, 1929, Butler's affection and admiration for the Chines e people was so great that he wrote Lejeune, \"It may be that when I am retired I will live among them.\" Their enthusiasm for him was equally unrestra ined. A friend with the Asiatic Fleet wrote him, \"The sendoff which the news papers at Tientsin gave to you and Mrs. Butler was a great and just tribut e to the cordial relations which you had so successfully established, not only with the Americans and the Chinese, but with everybody you came in contact with during your stay in North China.\" Butler was awarded the Yangtze Se rvice Medal and in July, 1929, promoted to major general-at forty-ei ght the youngest Marine officer ever to have reached this rank. The Navy Department decl ared, \"Probably no finer example of successful arbitration by American officers has been demonstrated in recent years than the peace-making achievements that crowned General Butle r's efforts in China in 1927 and 1928.\""},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Indispensable Man 105 17 Back home, Butler winced when Lejeune asked him to take command of the Parris Island, South Carolina, base. We ary after his China stint, he felt a need to renew his ties with kith and kin in his hometown of West Chester. He talked of retiring. \"I had better begin to think what is best for me and my family,\" he told Lejeune. \"I have given over thir ty years of my best to the Marine Corps.\" He was given a long leave home, wh ere he became aware of a rising tide of American sentiment matching his own growing distrust of the reasons for which armed forces were sent overseas. It had begun with a belated disillusionment over World War I, sparked by such books as All Quiet on the Western Front and Merchants o f Death. In 1925 a National Committee on the Cause and Cure of War had been founded, and a rapidly developing pacifist movement had compelled th e government to enter disarmament negotiations. By August, 1928, the antiwar movement was worldwide. Assigned once more to command the ba se at Quantico, Butler made it a Marine showplace and developed Marine football, baseball, and basketball teams with such high esprit de corps th at they played the best college teams of the East and often beat them. His fa therly interest in his men led him to help them with personal problems, get them out of trouble, and encourage them to write home. The admiration of Marines' families was expressed in a typical letter to him from Philadelphia: \"My brother in the Marines just came back from Nicaragua and he ask to be transferred to Phila. his Mother was Ill you complied with his wishes.

He did, however, finally yield to the pleas of American Legion official James J. Deighan that he attend the nation al convention in Scranton as a guest of honor. \"T he success of the 11th National Convention ... last week was in large part du e,\" Deighan wrote him gratefully afterward, \"to the fact that you were our guest.... The Legionnaires are all for you.\" News came that John Lejeune was resigning as commandant to head the Virginia Milita ry Academy and would be replaced by Butler's other old friend, Buck Ne ville, now a major gene ral. Thirty years had gone by since they had been an insepa rable trio in the feverish days of the Cuban campaign. Butler began to feel the weight of time and too many campaigns. The endless demand s on him made retirement and rest seem alluring. Asked once too often for a speech, he replied in Oct ober, 1929, \"I am not a crusader or a propagandist , nor have I message for anybody, so there is no object in my appear ing anywhere, except for money.\" He began to charge stiff lect ure fees to cut down de mands for him to travel everywhere to address luncheons and meetings as guest of honor. Perusing the morning papers on October z, he no ted a statement by Charles E. Mitchell, of the Natio nal City Bank: \"I know of nothing fundamentally wrong with the stoc k market or with the underlying business and credit situation.\" The following day there was a minor panic on the New York Stock Exchange, and a day later the market collapsed. On October 29 the bottom fell out in the blackest day in stock-market history, and within two weeks over thirty billion dollars in stock values were wiped out.

In a me ssage to Congress President Hoover reassure d them that there was nothing to worry about; business confidence had been rees tablished. Bootleggers, gang wars, and crime continued to be the ma jor preoccupation of the public. Despite Butler's reluct ance, more and more or ganizations insisted upon hearing the general who never pu lled his punches speak out on the law-and-order problem. There was a ground swell in Pennsylvania to nominate Philadelphia's former crimebuster for governor on the Republican ticket. A friend wrote from Washington, \"I note that some of the politicos may draft you as Dictator for Washington.\" In December, 1929, Butler was gl ad when a demand arose for a Senate investigation of the use of Marines to intervene in Latin American affairs. He upset the Hoover Administra tion by shooting from the hip in an extemporaneous speech he made in Pittsburgh, revealing that the State Department had rigged the Ni caraguan elections of 1912 by ordering him to use st rong-arm methods during the Marine intervention. \"The opposition candid ates in Nicaragua we re declared bandits when it became necessary to elect our man to office,\" he explained. And he said of Diaz, \"The fellow we had there nobody liked, but he was a useful fellow to us, so we ha d to keep him in. How to keep him in was a problem.\" Then he describe d how the election had been rigged, under orders, for that purpose. \"W hen a Marine is told to do something,\" he said , \"he does it.\" Butler's disclosures, picked up by the press, created a sensation in Washington. Alarm bells rang in the State Department; the last thing the administration wanted was an investigation concerning Marines then stationed in Nicarag ua. Officials angrily att acked Butler for \"loose talk.\" Secretary of State Henry L. S timson wrote a furious memo to Secretary of the Navy Ch arles Francis Adams: . . .

Navy Secretary Adams, a wealthy, polo-playing yachtsman, sent for Butler and delivered a blistering reprimand, declar ing that he was doing so at the direct personal or der of the Presiden t of the United States. Butler saw red. \"This is the first time in my se rvice of thirty-two years,\" he snapped back, \"that I've ever been ha uled on the carpet and treated like an unruly schoolboy.

Just two days after his attack on the government's gunboat diplomacy, which provoked a great public commotion, Undersecretary of State J. Reuben Clark privatel y submitted to Secretary of State Stimson the draft of a pl edge that the United States would never again claim the right to interv ene in the affairs of any Latin American country as an \"international policeman.\" The Clark Memorandum, which later became official policy-for a while at least-repudiated the (Theodore) Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine th at Smedley Butler had unmasked as raw gun boat diplomacy."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"The Indispensable Man 109 18 Defying Adams, Butler continued to express his conv ictions freely and publicly about current problems on wh ich he felt qualified to speak out. He was delighted in May, 1930, when Congress, over President Hoover's veto, passed a Spanish-American Wa r pension bill for veterans. With the unemployment rate climbing steadily to almost five million that year, he urged passage of a bonus bill for all veterans. The government had a solemn obligation to citizens who had risked their lives to protect it, Butler insisted, to see to it that they, their wives, and their children were not allowed to languish in hung er, poverty, and despair. Two deaths that year saddened him. His brother Horace was killed in a car accident in Texas, a nd his old friend Buck Neville died suddenly after briefly repl acing Lejeune as commandant. Now Butler was the senior-ranking major general in the Marine Corps, the logical choi ce as next commandant. An official inspection report had also praised Quantico as th e finest post in the United States. But on the same day that it appeared, Marine Co rps headquarters sent Butler a curt letter sugg esting that he make fe wer speeches, because his Quantico post was in poo r shape as a result of his frequent absences. In July, 1930, Secretary Adams paid a visit to Quantico, un- doubtedly to lay the groundwork for an official excuse to reject Butler's fitness to be appointed commandant. Butler was equally determined to demonstrate that the reb uke he had received about the \"poor shape\" of his post was totally unwarranted. Esco rting Adams everywhere over the barracks and parade grounds, he prov ed that Quantico was a model of efficiency. The dress-uniform revi ew of his crack regiments was flawless, and the Marine air squadr on performed brilliant maneuvers.

Controlling his temper, Butler pointed out the sports stadium bu ilt at almost no cost to the taxpayers. \"That's one of your damned follies! \" Adams muttered. He was clearly attempting to provoke the volatile Butle r into flaring up, and Butler knew it. Clenching his jaw, the general remained outwardly calm but could not resist telling a sharply barbed joke about \"an old buzzard\" who couldn't be pleased by anything. Several weeks later a Navy selec tion board met to choose a new commandant. One staff admiral declared th at he'd be damned before he'd see Butler made commandant; in no time at all the damned fellow would be trying to run the whole Navy. Others agreed. Adams happily discarded Butler's name and proposed instead Brigadier General Ben H. Fuller who, despite being junior in rank, was approved by the board. The news was the last straw for Bu tler, who now determined to retire within a year to devote himself to advocating the defense of the United States as he believed it ought to be de fended. Resolutely opposed to military intervention overseas on behalf of Wall St reet interests, he planned to arouse the American people into preventing an y more. At the same time he had doubts about the wisdom of entering world disarmament agreements, as leading pacifists proposed. Could the United States afford to disarm and trust the word of military dictators like Italy's Mussolini, with Hitler's swiftly growing Nazi party in Germany al ready laying the groundwork for a new war by renouncing the Versailles Treaty? In a speech before the influential Contemporary Club of Philadelphia on January 19, 1931, he declared, \"I ag ree with Dr. Hull of Swarthmore; if we could all lay down our arms, there couldn't be any war. But there are mad-dog nations who won't get the wo rd, who will refuse, to sign the agreement, or, if they sign it, refuse to abide by it.\" Seeking to impress his listeners with the kind of men dictators were, he added, \"A friend of mi ne said he had a ride in a new automobile with Mussolini, a car with an armored nose th at could knock over fences and slip under barbed wire.

Mussolini said he shouldn't do that, that it was only one lif e and the affairs of the state could not be stopped by one life.\" His listeners gasped audibly. Arms akimbo, his head thrust forward angrily, Butler demanded in a scornf ul voice, \"How can you talk disarmament with a man like that?\" He had been told that the audience was a private one a nd that he could speak in confidence, but he soon lear ned that there was no such thing as confidential speech for a man so often in the public eye. Among his listeners, unknown to him, was an It alian diplomat from Washington who had been invited to attend. The outraged diplomat at once repor ted Butler's remarks to Italian Ambassador de Martino. The embassy se nt a frantic cable to Rome, then filed an official protest with the State Department. The morning papers broke the story, and it made sensati onal headlines. A high-ranking American officer, wearing the Marine uniform on ac tive duty, had publicly insulted the head of a friendly power. Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson felt compelled to deliver a formal apology to Mussolini: \"The sincere regr ets of this govern ment are extended to Mr. Mussolini and to the Italia n people for the discourteous and unwarranted utterances by a commission ed officer of this government on active duty.\" The Washington military-diplomatic bureaucracy now decided that this time Butler had gone too far. Form al charges against him were hastily drawn and presented to President H oover, who promptly signed them. On the morning of January 29 Marine Co mmandant Ben Fuller phoned Butler at Quantico. \"General Butler, you are hereby placed under arrest to await trial by general court-martial. Y ou will turn over your command to your next senior, General Berkeley, and you will be restri cted to the limits of your post. The Secretary of the Navy wishes you to k now that this action is taken by the direct personal order of the President of the United States.\" The charges were \"conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline\" and \"conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.\" These accusations were known in the armed forces as"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 112 The Plot to Seize the White House Mother Hubbard charges because they \"covered everything.\" Most Marine officers were convinced that the power s-that-be had decided to \"throw the book\" at Old Gimlet Eye and drum him out of the Corps dishonorably, in revenge for his well-know n fighting man's scorn of Washington's desk warriors. Butler notified Brigadier General Ran dolph C. Berkeley, his junior officer at Quantico and a good friend, that he was under arrest-the first general officer to be placed under arre st since the Civil War. Butler's two- star command flag was lowered on the Qu antico flagstaff, a nd he offered his sword to Berkeley, who indign antly refused to accept it. Berkeley was outraged that Smed ley Butler, who wore eighteen decorations and was one of only four military men in American history who had ever been awarded tw o Medals of Honor, should be put under arrest by a telephone call. He was even more indignant that Butler had been confined to the post, hindering his ability to arra nge for his own defense at the court- martial. Defying the wrath of Adams, Berkeley himself went to Washington to get Butler's old comrade-in-arms He nry Leonard, who had lost an arm fighting beside him in the Boxer Re bellion and who now had a law practice in the Capital, to act as Butler's c ounsel. Leonard rushed off to Quantico immediately. A prisoner on his own post, Butler was wryly amused by an invitation to be guest of honor at a sportsme n's dinner. His aide-de-camp, L. C. Whitaker, replied dryly for him: \"As Gene ral Butler is under arrest, he will be unable to attend.\" 19 News of his arrest brought an outpouring of sympathy and support for him not only among his far-flung and influen tial staunch friends but also among millions of Americans who despised Mussolini and everything the dictator stood for.

Many Americans, moreover, were fed up with the Hoover Ad- ministration for sitting on its hands w ith the Depression rapidly worsening, and esteemed a public leader who at l east had the courage of his convictions and spoke them bluntly. Italian-Amer ican anti-Fascists also rallied to Butler's support by bitter protests ag ainst Stimson's apology to Mussolini. The administration grew alarmed as a rolling tidal wave of angry criticism o£ Butler's arrest swept across the country. \"Unless we are mistaken,\" declared a Washington Daily News editorial, \"the American people are likel y to consider these Cabinet officials guilty of a strange timidity toward Mussolini on one hand and of an unwarranted harshness toward a splendi d American soldier on the other.\" Public opinion on the side of Butle r made itself felt so quickly and emphatically that the administration fo und it necessary to ameliorate the conditions of his arrest. Hi s restriction to the post was lifted, allowing him to travel where he needed to in or der to arrange for his defense. He wired New York Governor Franklin D.

The trial threaten ed to become a cause celebre, with, implications for the whole system of military justice, especially after a Marine colonel denounced Ameri can court-martials as basically unjust. The impending trial was also thro wing a spanner into Secretary of State Stimson's plans fo r forging an international naval arms limitation agreement. Crucial to that agreement were pr eliminary negotiations between Italy and France, which fear ed Italian and German fascism. Resisting Stimson's pressure to sign an arms limitation agreement with Mussolini, the French cited as justif ication popular Amer ican support of Butler's view that Mussol ini could not be trusted and widespread protest over his arrest for saying so. Mussolini himself, alar med by the bad press he was getting in the United States, with a few notorious exceptions, sent word to Stimson that he considered the whole incident an \"unfortunate error\" and believed it would be best for all concerned if th e whole plan to c ourt-martial Butler could be quietly dropped. Stimson, who now realized that he had a tiger by the tail, passed the word to the crestfallen Adams. The Secretary of the Navy now had to beat a hasty retreat with as much dignity as he could muster out of his humiliating predicament. He sent Leonard a lett er announcing his decision to \"settle\" the matter by calling off th e court-martial and simply detaching Butler from his command with a reprima nd, placing him on the inactive list with the limbo status of \"awaiting orders.\" In polite language Leonard told Adams to go to hell.

There would be no court-martial and no re moval of Butler from Quantico. Roaring a third refusal, Leona rd demanded that Adams stop dawdling and proceed to tria l. By now the administrati on, in a state of near panic, meekly asked Leonard just wh at terms for settlin g the matter would be acceptable to General Butler. Leonard, jubilant at this abject su rrender, conferred with Morris and Butler. Angry at his persecutors, Butle r wanted to insist upon the court- martial, but as he conf ided to a relative on February 12, \"Mother and Bunny [his wife] were both breaking und er the strain,\" and he decided that it wasn't worth their anguis h to fight the establishmen t to a finish. \"I feel we could have licked them badly,\" he added, \"but now I have a club over their heads, as they were warned that we would tell if they tried any more persecutions.” Since he had already won a clear mo ral victory, he decided he could afford to let the government save a lit tle face. He agreed to write a letter reiterating his explanation that the Mu ssolini speech had been made at a private club meeting and expressing regret that anything he had said \"caused embarrassment to the Govern ment.\" He would accept an official gentle \"reprimand,\" which was, however, not to be written by Adams but by Leonard himself for Adams to sign. In return for thes e concessions the government would announce that it wa s dropping its court martial and was immediately restoring the general to his command with full rank and privileges, without prejudice of any kind. The administration hast ily accepted Butler's te rms, and the suitable papers were drawn. On February 9 the court-martial was canceled, and a mild reprimand credited Butler's explanation th at his speech had been intended to be \"confined to the limits of four walls,\" as well as acknowledging his \"long record of brilliant service.\" One newspaper headlined the story: \"YOU'RE A VERY BAD BOY\"- SAYS ADAMS TO BUTLER."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 116 The Plot to Se ize the White House The general's admirers grinned in delight.

He don't belong in Peace time. He is what I would call a natural born warrior. He will fight anybody, any time. But he just can't distinguish Peace from war. He carries every meda l we ever gave out. He has two Congressio nal Medals of Honor, the only man that ever got a double header.* You give him another war an d he will get him another one.... I do admire him.\" The press was reluctant to let the story die. The wire services carried journalist Cornelius Vanderbilt's reve lation that he had been the one who had told Butler the true story about Mu ssolini. He corrected a few details. After running down the chil d, Vanderbilt said, Mussolini had observed the journalist looking back in horror a nd had patted his knee reassuringly, saying, \"Never look back , Mr. Vanderbilt-always look ahead in life.\" Italian officials now sought to deny th at Vanderbilt had ever ridden in a car with Mussolini. Butler was appalled, but not too surprised, to read that Ralph T. O'Neill, national commander of the Am erican Legion, had presented to Italian Ambassador de Martino a resoluti on in praise of Mussolini, passed by the National Executive Committee. There were po werful and influential wealthy elements in the Legion l eadership who admi red Mussolini's shackling of Italian la bor unions under the guis e of fighting Reds. Now that he had defeated the attemp t of his enemies to court-martial him, Butler revealed to his friends that he intende d to go ahead with his original plan to retire at the end of the year. On March 1 he informed the press, barking, \"Get this clear-I are not resigning! ” *Rogers's mistake was a common error. In addition to Smedley Butler, three other Americans have each won two Congressional Medals of Honor."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Indispensable Man 117 20 Butler now found himself in greater demand than ever as public speaker. The Alber Lecture Bureau of Cleveland pleaded with him to take a leave of absence and satisfy the groups all over the country clamorin g to hear him. He was offered half of admission fees charged, with a minimum guarantee of $250, $25 a day expenses and railroad fare. At the same time Philadelphia’s Mayor Mackey asked him if he would assist in raising funds for the city’s Committee for Unemployment Relief. Applying for a two months’ leave of absence to make a sp eaking tour, he turn ed over half his fees of about six thousand dollars to the unemployed and also to the Salvation Army, which he respected as being genuinely responsive to the needs of both the poor and the doughboys in trenches. He explained the impuls e for his decision by a letter he had received while he was under arrest during the Mu ssolini affair. “General,” a veteran had written him, “the stamp on this lett er cost me the two of my last four cents, but I wanted you to know that I am for you.” “I almost cried,” Butler admitted. “I feel that if that poor fellow could give me half of what he had, I can give him half of what I’ve got.” He was also strongly influenced in his sympathy for the luckless by his aunt, Isabel Darlington, who headed the Chester County Poor Board and fought county authorities vigoro usly to increase welfare funds. Publishers begged him for a book . “I am making far more money out of making speeches than I ever could out of writ ing a book,” he replied practically, “so unless Bo bbs-Merrill are going to outbid the public...I would be cutting off my nose to spite my face by writing instead of talking.” But he finally consented"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"118 The Plot to Seize the White House The Indispensable Man 119 to dictate his war memoirs to a dventure writer Lowell Thomas, who published them as a book, under the title Old Gimlet Eye. Aware that his imminent retiremen t meant a sharp drop in income and an increase in expenses, with littl e or nothing saved, he sought to organize his time as profitably as possi ble. He accepted radio offers to relate his experience s in the Marines. If Butler did not consciously seek publicity, there was little doubt that the headlines sought him out. His rapport with the press was explained by one newsman's observation that he was \"colorful copy and a helluva guy.\" He often said himself, \"There are three types of people who understand me-Marines, policemen , and newspapermen.\" His chief interest in stories about him in the press was less vanity than a determination to disseminat e views he held strongly. With the first ominous rumblings of war beginning to be heard in both Europe and Asia, he was determined to steel the American people against letting themselves be dragge d into any more foreign wars. He would tell them the whole truth about the use that had been made of the Marines by the government in the na me of protecting democracy and \"American interests\" abroad. On August 21, 1931, invited to address an American Legion convention in Connecticut, he made the first no-holds-barred antiwar speech of his career. It stunned all who heard it or read it in the few papers that dared report it in part: I spent 33 years . . . being a hi gh-class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the ba nkers.

I am a peaceloving Quaker, but when war breaks out every damn man in my family goes. If we're ready, nobody will tackle us. Give us a club and we will face them all.... There is no use talking about abolishing war; that's damn foolishness. Take the guns away from men and they will fight just the same. . . . In the Spanish-American War we didn't have any bullets to shoot, and if we had not had a war with a nation that was already licked and looking for an excuse to quit, we would have had hell licked out of us.... No pacifists or Commu nists are going to govern this country. If they try it there will be seven million men like you rise up and strangle them. Pacifists? Hell, I'm a pacifist, but I always have a club behind my back! Earlier that same day, before H oover had had a chance to read the speech, reporters asked the President if he would seek to delay the general's retirement. \"I assume that if General Butler wishes to retire, the authorities will approve,\" Hoover answered cau tiously. \"The general is a very distinguished and gallant officer and I have no doubt that if the country has need, it always can secure his se rvices.\" Next day, when Butler's attack on big business was reported, attempts to get any statement from the White House met with icy silence. And on that day, providing a punctuation mark to Butler's doubts that the Kellogg-Briand Pact protect ed any nation from aggression, Japan invaded Manchuria and reduced the pact to a worthless scrap of paper. On October 1, 1931, friends of Sm edley Butler from all stations in life, and from all periods of his career , gathered at Quantico as his two- star command flag was hauled dow n once more, this lime with full honors.

I want you to come around and see me, especially if you ever get into trouble, and I will help you if I can. I can give you a square meal and a place to sleep ev en if I cannot guarantee you a political job.\" He meant every word, gave out the maps, and kept his promise for as long as he lived. 21 Demands flooded in now for Butler's services as a lecturer. He had embarrassed governments, large and small, including his own, by his relentless candor, but his cour age and honesty had ' won the admiration of millions of Americans. His sp eeches be' came more vitriolic than ever, scor ching the hides of the powerful and the highly placed. He met eager requests for articl es by magazines and newspaper syndicates with the help of his friend E. Z. Dimitman, who was now night city editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer. Dimitman would flesh out his views on war and peace, which Butler then edit ed and revi sed to his own satisfaction. There never seemed to be enou gh money. Although he received some lecture fees up to $500, the average fee came to $25o and in many cases turned out to be far less.

It was an old square farmhouse that had been gutted by fire except for its walls. Butler had rebuilt it with glass-enclosed porches and a huge, high hallway in which he erected his two treasured Chinese Blessings Umbrellas, opened like ca nopies at each end of the hall. He had thought to remodel th e house for $35,000, but it had turned out to cost far more, and he was forced to sell most of the land to pay off the mortgage. As a civilian Butler was close-fi sted with money, gently but firmly resisting the en dless letters he receive d begging for handouts, because he had no money to spare. His thrifty wife kept an old, ragged, shabby fur coat in the closet, over th irty years after he had brought it home for her from the Boxer Rebellion. She never wore it, but could not bring herself to throw it aw ay. He himself upset many military organizations by cancel ing his membership and journal subscriptions without offering any explanation. He was too proud to admit the real reason; he simply had to prune expenses. Out of uniform, he took pride in his appearance and dressed well but conservatively. Unable to break the traditions of thirty-three years of dress parade, he polished his sh oes daily and buffed the buttons on his white, custom-made summer suit s. His thought patterns, too, continued to dwell primarily on military concerns. One of his objectives was to stir up a demand that the Marine Corps be removed from under the t humb of politically appointed desk admirals of the Navy and set up as a separate branch of the armed forces under their own leaders. He ga ve his reasons in an article called \"To Hell with the Admirals!

The tablet that had been erected in his honor in the Navy Building was removed. Later located and rescued by a Butler Memorial Commission, it was installed in Philade lphia's City Hall after his death. Another article Butler wrote for Liberty stirred the wrath of the Honduras Government by exposing the collaboration of Honduran and other Central American dictator s with American banking and commercial interests. The contro lled Honduran pres s accused him of misrepresenting the situation and sh owered him with epithets. From Tegucigalpa a New York Times correspondent wired, \"I t is realized that he is now retired, and not subject to the restrain t which can be imposed on an officer in active service.\" More and more of Butler's attent ion was directed to the steadily worsening Depression and what it was doing to the country. He was outraged when hunger marchers who had gone to Washington on December 7 were denied admission to the White House to petition for jobs. During 1932 stocks fe ll go percent, farm products 6o percent, industrial productio n 50 percent. By the end of the year fifteen million Americans were in the ranks of the unemployed. Homeowners and farmers were being disp ossessed for nonpayment of taxes and debts. Outraged neighbors in many communities were setting up roadblocks with guns to bar outside bidders at foreclosure auctions so that the property could be bought for a song and returned to its owners. Alarmed bankers saw this develo pment as a Communist threat. Butler's antagonism toward big bu siness intensified.

In the spring Pennsy lvania Governor Gifford Pinchot urged Butler to throw his hat into the po litical ring and oppose James J. Davis, former Secretary of Labor under Hoover, for the Re-publican nomination for senator. His admire rs were already demanding that Butler run for governor. \"I am not going to run for the Senate or governorship,\" he growled to newspaper friends, \"and th en have the politicians laugh at me.\" But Pinchot's entreaties were to o strong and persistent, and Butler reluctantly agreed. Stumping the state, he appealed to Republican voters with a platform promising jobs for the unemployed an d home property loans for debtors.

Although he was pers onally popular, two issues he campaigned fo r in 1932Prohibition a nd the soldiers' bonus- were not. Despite receiving half a million votes, he was defeated. Paul Comly French of the Philadelphia Record revealed that Governor Pinchot had set Butler up for defeat to eliminate him as a political threat, making a secret deal to su pport Davis. The Pinchot political machine had been used against Butler in ke y election districts. Reporter Jesse Laventho l, later city editor of the Philadelphia Record, who had been Butler's press s ecretary during the campaign, told the author, \"Butler's sponsors failed him . . . , trading off votes for Davis in return for electing certain st ate senators to give the governor control of that body.\" So Smedley Butler never went to Congress like his father."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" 124 The Plot to Seize the White House 22 In the early summer of 1932 over tw enty thousand veterans and their families joined in a Bonus Army ma rch to Washington, camping on the edge of the Capital to demand pa yment of a two-billion-dollar cash bonus to all veterans. The House, tinder pressure, quickly passed the Patman Bonus Bill on June 17, but the Republican Senate rejected it, 62 to 18. Butler was indignant at the failur e of Congress to honor America's pledge to its fighting men and was thoroughly disgusted with Hoover's failure to do anything about the plight of the nation except issue optimistic reports that prosperity was \"just around the corner.\" On June 30, while the Democratic convention was in session, he announced that he might, for the firs t time in his life, vote Democratic \"if the right man is nominated for President.\" It was no secret that he saw the right man as New York's gove rnor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had already broadcast an impressive speech on the need of the American Government to discover its \"forgotten man.\" When Roosevelt won the nominati on, pledging a New Deal along with the repeal of Prohibition, Bu tler wired him, \"W e salute your nomination as one of the greatest blessings granted any nation in an hour of desperate need.\" He offered to help F.D.R.'s campaign any way he could, and Roosevelt asked him to get in touch with Democratic campaign manager James A.

He agreed, not only to earn the money involved but also because he saw the trip as a way to get to know his fellow Americans better. He knew more about the Cacos of Haiti than the residents of Michigan Boulevard, more about the thinking of Nicaraguans and Chinese than of Manhattanites and Californians.

A chorus of newspaper fury and frustration refl ected the dismay of banking and industrial interests over Roosevelt's election. Less than three weeks be fore the President-elect 's inauguration, an unsuccessful attempt was made to a ssassinate him at Miami. Could the assassin's bullet possibly have been negotiated for, Butler speculated, by a big-business cabal that hated Ro osevelt and dreaded a New Deal? 23 Many veterans' posts now started a m ovement to have Butler appointed administrator of the U.S. Veterans Bureau in January, 1933, and sent resolutions to Roosevelt to this effect. Soon after the N.R.A. began, Gene ral Hugh Johnson asked Butler to work with him in administering th e program. Butler thanked him but refused, explaining, \"I don't want to be tied up with anything I don’t know about.” Meanwhile lie watched with fascination the swift unfolding of developments in the New Deal from the time Roosevelt declared at his inauguration on March 4, 1933, \"Let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\" Next day the new President procla imed a national bank holiday and embargoed the exportation of gold.

As the American people stir red with new hope that at last the government was beginning to fight th e nightmare Depres sion, Butler noted with satisfaction that the bankers a nd industrialists of the nation were horrified. Meanwhile between July and Dece mber he had been pursued and wooed by Jerry MacGuire, the bond salesman for Grayson M.-P. Murphy and Company, who had sought to enlist him in the schemes of the financial group he represented. It was with some relief that he was temporarily freed from these persistent attentions on December 1, when MacGuire went abroad on an un explained mission for his backers. Early in December, 1933 , Butler began touring the country for the V.F.W. and made headlines by speaki ng out with charact eristic bluntness to attack the leader ship of the American Legion . He told a large gathering of veterans in New Orleans that the V.F.W. commander \"would not sell out his men as the officers in charge of the Am erican Legion have.\" Sharing the platform with Senato r Huey Long, he urged Long to concentrate on fighting for the vetera ns' bonus and forg et less important matters. \"What the hell do you know about the gold standard?\" he challenged Long. \"Don't pay any attent ion to what the newspapers say. Stand by your friends and to hell with the rest of them!\" Taking Long's political demagoguery at face value, he believed him to be sincere in his advo cacy of a redistribution of national wealth and praised him as a man \"with nerve enough to maintain a fight against Wall Street.\" He urged the veterans to \"make Wall Street pay, to take Wall Street by the throat and shake it up.\" If they wa nted to get the bonus that had been promised them, they would have \"to orga nize . . . to get together . . . to do as the veterans of ot her wars have done.\" It was a fighting speech in the classic populist ve in, and it sparked national controversy.

His suspicions about Clark and Maguire were obviously very much on his mind when he made it. \"To many it may seem strange for a military man to denounce dictatorship,\" he declared. \"General ly it is the military men who are advocates of this st ern measure. . . . But we do not need a dictator and we would not have one anyway, because our temperament and traditions forbid it.\" He made it clear that he was stumpi ng the country only on behalf of the ordinary \"forgotten soldier,\" ju st as F.D.R. had crusaded for the \"forgotten man.\" He told reporters, \"I went on the re tired list after thirty-three years of making wars, to rock and rock. So many former soldiers came to me with their pathetic stories that I bounced out of retirement. All we soldiers are asking is that the nation give us th e same break that is being given the manufacturers, the bankers, the industrialists. . . . Jimmie [Van Zandt] and I are going around the country trying to educate the soldiers out of the sucker class.\" If American Legion officialdom was furious at Butler's charges, the rank and file were not. Typical of the barrage of fan mail cheering him on was a letter from a Los Angeles Legionnai re: \"Every word you say is true, and I, as an ex-soldier and one of the rank and file, respect fully request that you assume the active leadership of th e ex-servicemen.

Ex-servicemen were made the butt of an Economy Act passed by Congress, Butler charged, because \"the pr inciple of taking care of soldiers is nothing at all but an old-age pension to which the nation eventually will come, and the bankers don't want it.\" He added caustically, \"If Charles Dawes got ninety million dollars for a si ck bank, soldiers ought to get it for sick comrades.\" Pointing out that vete rans could muster twenty million votes among themselves and their families, he urged them to use this pressure at the polls to force decen t care of the disabled.

If not-put 'em out!\" He warned veterans not to believe \"the propaganda capital circulates\" in the press, which he condemned as largely capitalist-controlled. \"The paper that takes the part of the soldier,\" he charged, \"loses advertising.\" His concern for disabled veterans was not mere rhetoric. He met many of them in the eighteen vetera ns' hospitals he visited during his tour of the country. Hi s walks through the ward s to talk with them filled him with an angry grief. In his days of combat he had seen many men killed and wounded. But the crus hing impact of seeing fifty thousand young men gathered together in \"living graveyards,\" forgotten by their country and the people for whom they had sacrificed arms, legs, faces, and minds, mo ved him to rage agains t the old men in power who had doomed them to lives of empty despair."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Indispensable Man 131 \"Seventeen years ago they were th e pick of the nation,\" he wrote grimly. \". . .

He proposed two constitutional amendm ents. The first would make it impossible for war to be declared except by the exclusive vote of those physically able to fight.

There was some talk about a flo od of telegrams that came in and influenced them and I was so much amused, because it all happened right in my room. Then MacGuire stopped to see me on his way back from the convention. This time he came in a hi red limousine . . . and told me that they had been successful in putting over their move.

MacGui re had then sought to draw Butler out on his subsequent plans. BUTLER: He said, \"You ar e going on a trip fo r the Veterans of Foreign Wars. You are going around recr uiting them, aren't you?\" I said, \"Yes; I am going to st art as soon as this campaign is over.\" CHAIRMAN: When wa s this campaign? BUTLER: This was in November , 1933.

You know I believe that sooner or later there is going to be a test of our democracy, a test of this democratic form of government. The soldiers are th e only people in this country who have ever taken an oath to sustai n it.

It had been written by Val O'Fa rrell, a former New York City detective who had become one of the city 's leading criminal and civil investigators. On December 11, 1933, O'Farrell had written to presidential secretary Louis Howe: My dear Colonel: . . .

This would ha ve meant an additional ten thousand dollars to General Butl er, but he told the representative of the gold group that even if he were offered a hundred thousand dollars to do this, his answer would be \"no.\" Notwithstanding the fact that I do not know General Butler, who has been occasionally subject to ha rsh criticism for the things he has done or failed to do, I felt it my duty to report this incident to you as it shows him to be a man of exceptional character. You can probably obtain the name of the representative of this gold group from General Butler, or if you are intereste d, I may be able to get it for you. 3 Butler found himself fasc inated by MacGuire, su specting that the bond salesman might be playin g some kind of shrewd con game with Clark, using his contact with Bu tler as a lever with wh ich to pry money out of the alarmed millionaire. BUTLER: I began to get the idea that he was using Clark-to pull money out of Clark by frightening him about his $30 ,000,000-and then he was coming to me; and then he would go back and tell Clark, \"I have been to see Butler, and he will go along if you will get me $ 5,000 more.\" In other words, I could see him working both ends against the middle and making a sucker out of Clar k. However, if Clark wanted to get rid of his money, it was none of my business. . . . Now, he [MacGuire] is a very cagey individual. He always approaches everything from afar. He is really a very nice, plausible fellow. But I gather, after this associ ation with him, that due to this wound in his head, he is a little incons istent, a little flighty. He is being used, too, but I do "},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"The Conspiracy Explodes 153 not think Clark is using him. My impression is that Murphy uses him; and he uses Clark, beca use Clark has the money. During MacGuire's trip to Euro pe, Butler testified, the bond salesman had sent him a postcard fro m Nice in Febr uary, 1934, and a short note later from Berlin, both of th e \"having wonderful time\" variety. Then after MacGuire's return, upon his urging to see Butler on a matter of the utmost importance, they had met in the empty restaurant of Philadelphia's Bellevue Hotel, on August 22, 1934. BUTLER: He told me all about his trip to Europe.... He said, \"I went abroad to study the part that the veteran plays in the various set- ups of the governments that they have abroad. I went to Italy for two or three months and studied the position th at the veterans of Italy occupy in the Fascist set-up of government, and I discovered that they are the background of Mussolini. They keep them on the pay rolls in various ways and keep them contented an d happy; and they are his real backbone, the force on which he ma y depend, in case of trouble, to sustain him. But that set-up would not suit us at all. The soldiers of America would not like that. I then we nt to Germany to see what Hitler was doing, and his whole strength lies in organizations of soldiers, too. But that would not do. I looked into the Russian business. I found that the use of the soldiers over there woul d never appeal to our men. Then I went to France, and I found just ex actly the organization we are going to have. It is an organization of su persoldiers.\" He gave me the French name for it, but I do not recall what it is. I never could have pronounced it, anyhow. Bu t I do know that it is a superorganization of members of all the other soldiers' or ganizations of France, composed of noncommissioned officers a nd officers. He told me that they had about 500,000 and that each one was a leader of ten others, so that it gave them 5,000,000 votes. And he said, \"Now, that is our idea here in America-to get up an orga nization of that kind.\" Investigators for the McCormack-Dickstein Committee were able to uncover a report on this French \"superor ganization,\" the Croix de Feu, that MacGuire had written about to Robert S."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"154 The Plot to Seize the White House Clark and Clark's attorney, Albert Grant Christmas, from France on March 6, 1934: I had a very interesting talk last evening with a man who is quite well up on affairs here and he seems to be of the opinion that the Croix de Feu will be very patr iotic during this crisis and will take the [wage] cuts or be the moving spirit in the veterans to accept the cuts. Therefore they will, in all probability, be in opposition to the Socialists and functionaries. The general spirit among the functionaries seems to be that the correct way to regain rec overy is to spend more money and increase wages, rather than to put more people out of work and cut salaries. The Croix de Feu is getting a gr eat number of new recruits, and I recently attended a meeting of this organization and was quite impressed with the type of men bel onging. These fellows are interested only in the salvation of France, and I feel sure that the country could not be in better hands b ecause they are not politicians, they are a cross- section of the best people of the c ountry from all walks of life, people who gave their \"all\" between 1914 and 1918 that France might be saved, and I feel sure that if a crucial test ever comes to the Republic that these men will be the bulwark upon which France will be saved. During their meeting in Philadelphi a, Butler testified, MacGuire had revealed the plans of his group to develop an American Croix de Feu. BUTLER: I said, \"What do you want to do with it when you get it up?\" \"Well,\" he said, \"we want to support the President.\" I said, \"The President does not need the support of that kind of an organization. Since when did you become a supporter of the President? The last time I talked to you you were against him.\" He said, \"Well, he is goi ng to go along with us now.\" \"Is he?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, what are you going to do with these men, suppose you get these 500,000 men in America? . . .\" "},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"The Conspiracy Explodes 155 \"Well,\" he said, \"they will be the support of the President.\" I said, \"The President has got the whole Ameri can people. Why does he want them?\" He said, \"Don't you understand th e set-up has got to be changed a bit? . . . He has got to have mo re money. There is not any more money to give him. Eighty percent of the money now is in Government bonds, and he cannot keep this racket up much longer. . . . He has either got to get more money out of us or he has got to change the method of financing the Government, and we are going to see to it that he does not change that method. He will not change it.\" I said, \"The idea of this great group of soldiers, then, is to sort of frighten him, is it?\" \"No, no, no; not to frighten him. This is to sustain him when others assault him.\" I said, \"Well, I do not know about that. How would the President explain it?\" He said: \"He will not necessarily have to explain it, be cause we are going to help him out. Now, di d it ever occur to you that the President is overworked? We might have an Assistant President, somebody to take the blame; and if things do not work out, he can drop him.\" He went on to say that it did not take any constitutional change to authorize another Cabinet official , somebody to take over the details of the office-take them off the Presid ent's shoulders. He mentioned that the position would be a secretary of general affairs-a sort of a supersecretary. CHAIRMAN: A secretary of general affairs? BUTLER: That is the term used by him-or a secretary of general welfare-I cannot recall which. I came out of the interview with that name in my head. I got that idea fr om talking to both of them, you see [MacGuire and Clark]. They had both talked about the same kind of relief that ought to be given the Pr esident, and he [MacGuire] said: \"You know, the American people will swallow th at. We have got the newspapers. We will star t a campaign that the President's health is failing. Everybody can tell that by looking at him, and the dumb American people will fall for it in a second.\" And I could see it. They had that sympathy racket, that "},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" 156 The Plot to Seize the White House they were going to have somebody take the patronage off of his shoulders and take all the worries a nd details off of hi s shoulders, and then he will be like the President of France. . . . Now, I cannot recall which one of these fellows told me about the rule of succession, about the Secretary of State becoming President when the Vice President is eliminated. Ther e was something said in one of the conversations that I had, that the President's health was bad, and he might resign, and that [V ice President] Garner did not want it, anyhow, and then this supersecretary would ta ke the place of the Secretary of State and in the order of succession would become President. That was the idea. In corroborative test imony Paul Comly French described what MacGuire had told him about the conspirators' plans. FRENCH: During the course of th e conversation he continually discussed the need of a man on a white horse, as he called it, a dictator who would come galloping in on his wh ite horse. He said that was the only way; either through the threat of armed force or the delegation of power, and the use of a group of organized ve terans, to save the capitalistic system. He warmed up considerably after we got under wa y and he said, \"We might go along with Roosevel t and then do with him what Mussolini did with th e King of Italy.\" It fits in with what he told the general, that we would have a Secretary of General Affair s, and if Roosevelt play ed ball, swell; and if he did not, they would push him out. He expressed the belief that at least half of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars w ould follow the general if he would announce such a plan. In censored testimony Bu tler revealed that M acGuire had implicated General Hugh Johnson, head of the N.R.A., as Roosevelt's own choice to become an assist ant President. † BUTLER: He said, \"That is what he [Roosevelt] was building up Hugh Johnson for. Hugh Johnson ta lked too damn "},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"The Conspiracy Explodes 157 much and got him into a hole, and he is going to fire him in the next three or four weeks.\" I said, \"How do you know all this?\" \"Oh,\" he said, \"we are in with him all the ti me. We know what is going to happen.\" After having revealed the plans of the plotte rs, Butler testified, MacGuire had then bluntly asked the general to be the Man on a White Horse they were looking for. BUTLER: He said, \". . . Now, about this supe rorganization - would you be interest ed in heading it?\" I said, \"I am interested in it, but I do not kn ow about heading it. I am very greatly interested in it, because you know , Jerry, my interest is, my one hobby is, maintaining a democracy. If you get these 500,00o soldiers advocati ng anything smelling of Fasc ism, I am going to get 500,000 more and lick bell out of you, and we will have a real war right at home. You know that.\" \"Oh, no. We do not want that. We want to ease up on the President.\" . . . \"Yes; and then you will put some body in there yo u can run; is that the idea? The Pres ident will go around and christen babies and dedicate bridges, and kiss children . Mr. Roosevelt wi ll never agree to that himself.\" \"Oh, yes; he will. He will agree to that.\" I said, \"I do not believe he will.\" I said, \"D on't you know that this will cost money, what y ou are talking abou t? He says, \"Yes; we have got $3,000,000 to start with, on the li ne, and we can get $300,000,000, if we need it.\" \"Who is going to put all this money up?\" \"Well,\" he said, \"you heard Clar k tell you he was willing to put up $15,000,000 to save the other $15,000,000.\" Butler had then probed for partic ulars of the cabal's plans for organizing their projected m ilitary superorganization. BUTLER: \"How are you going to care for all these men?\" He said, \"Well, the Government will not give them pensions , or anything of that kind, but we will give it to them."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"158 The Plot to Seize the White House We will give privates $10 a month and destitute captains $35. We will get them, all right.\" \"It will cost you a lot of money to do that.\" He said, \"We will only have to do that for a year, and then everything will be all right again.\" . . . He said that they had this money to spend on it, and he wanted to know again if I would head it, and I said, \"No, I am interested in it, but will not head it.\" Seeking to persuade him to cha nge his mind, Butler testified, MacGuire had sought to impress him with the importance of the interests who were involved in the plot. BUTLER: He said, \"When I was in Paris, my headquarters were Morgan & Hodges. We had a mee ting over there. I might as well tell you that our group is for you, fo r the head of th is organization. Morgan & Hodges are against you. Th e Morgan interests say that you cannot be trusted, that you will he too radical, and so forth, that you are too much on the side of the l ittle fellow; you cannot be trusted. They do not want you. But our group tells them that you are the only fellow in America who can get the soldiers together. They say, `Yes, but he will get them together and go in the wrong way.' That is what they say if you take charge of them.\" According to MacGuire, Butler te stified, the Morgan interests preferred other noted milita ry figures as head of the projected veterans' army. Discussion of these choices was also eliminated from the published version of the hearings. † BUTLER: [MacGuire said,] \"They are for Douglas Mac- Arthur as the head of it. Dougl as MacArthur's term expires in November, and if he is not reappointed it is to be presumed that he will be disappointed and sore and they are for getting him to head it.\" I said, \"I do not think that you will get the soldiers to follow him, Jerry. . . . He is in bad odor , because he put on a uniform with medals to march down the street in Washington, I know the soldiers.\" "},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The Conspiracy Explodes 159 \"Well, then, we will get Hanford MacNider. They want either MacArthur or MacNider. . . .\" I said, \"MacNider won't do either. He will not get the soldiers to follow him, because he has been opposed to the bonus.\" \"Yes, but we will have him in change [charge?].\" And it is interesting to note that three weeks later after this conversation 'MacNider changed and turned around for the bonus. It is interesting to note that. He [MacGuire] said, \"There is going to be a big quarrel over the reappointment of MacArthur . . . you watch the President reappoint him. He is going to go ri ght and if he does not reappoint him, he is going to go left.\" I have been watching with a great deal of interest this quarrel over his reappointment to see how it comes out. He [MacGuire] said, \"You know as well as I do that MacArthur is Stotesbury's son in law in Philadelphia-[Stotesbury bei ng] Morgan's representative in Philadelphia. You just see how it goes and if I am not telling the truth.\" I noticed that MacNider turn ed around for the bonus, and that there is a row over the re appointment of MacArthur. 4 Convinced by now of the seriousness of the plot, and its magnitude, Butler had endeavored to learn how far along the conspirators were in the creation of the new superorganization that would control the proposed veterans' army. MacGuire gave him some tips on recognizing its appearance. BUTLER: Now, there is one point . . . which I think is the most important of all. I said, \"W hat are you going to call this organization?\" He said, \"Well, I do not know.\" I said, \"Is there anything stirring about it yet?\" "},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" 160 The Plot to Seize the White House \"Yes,\" he says; \"you watch; in tw o or three weeks you will see it come out in the paper. There will be bi g fellows in it. This is to be the background of it. These are to be th e villagers in the opera. The papers will come out with it-\" He did not give me the name of it, but he said that it would all be made public; a society to maintain the Constitution, and so forth. They had a lot of talk this time about maintaining the Constitution. I said, \"I do not see that the Constitution is in any danger.\" Butler's next observatio n, possibly the most significant in all his testimony, was missing fro m the published version of his testimony. It was the link between the conspiracy and the powerful interests Butler had good reason to believe were the \"big fellows\" in the background. † BUTLER: . . . and in about two weeks the American Liberty League appeared, which was just a bout what he described it to be. The American Liberty League, wh ich had brokerag e head Grayson M.-P. Murphy as its treasurer and Robert S. Clark as one of its financiers, also had John W. Davis, alleged writer of the gold-standard speech for Clark, as a member of the National Executive Committee. Its contributors included representatives of the Morg an, Du Pont, Rockefeller, Pew, and Mellon interests. Directors of the Leag ue included A1 Smith and John J. Raskob. League later formed affiliat ions with pro-Fascist, antilabor, and anti-Semitic organizations. It astonished Butler that former New York Governor A1 Smith, who had lost the 1928 presidential race to Hoover as the Democratic candidate, could be involve d in a Fascist plot backed by wealthy men. But the \"happy warrior\" who had grown up on New York's East Side had traded his brown derby for a black on e. He was now a business associate of the powerful Du Pont family, who had cultivat ed him through Du Pont official John J. Raskob, former chairman of the Democratic party. Under their influence Smith had grown more and more politically conservative following his defeat."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"The Conspiracy Explodes 161 Butler's query about Smith, and MacGuire's reply, were both deleted from the official testimony of the hearings. † BUTLER: I said, \"What is the idea of Al Smith in this?\" \"Well,\" he said, \"A1 Smith is getting ready to assault the Administration in his magazine. It w ill appear in a mont h or so. He is going to take a shot at the money question. He has definitely broken with the President.\" I was interested to note that a bout a month later he did, and the New Outlook took the shot that he told me a month before they were going to take. Let me say that this fellow [MacGuire] has been able to tell me a month or six weeks ahead of time everything that happened. That made him interesting. I wanted to see if he was going to come out right. . . . In testimony that was also censore d, Paul Comly French revealed that MacGuire had implicated the Du Ponts to him, indicating the role they would play in equipping the supe rarmy being planned by the plotters. † FRENCH: We discussed the question of arms and equipment, and he suggested that they could be obtained from the Remington Arms Co., on credit through the Du Ponts. I do not think at that time he mentioned the connections of Du Pouts with the American Liberty Lea gue . . . but he skirted all around the idea that that was the back door ; one of the Du Pouts is on the board of directors of the American Libert y League and they own a controlling interest in the Remington Arms Co.... He said the General would not have any trouble enlisting 500,000 men. In a story it ran on November 21, 1934, The New York Times noted, \"According to General Butler ... he was to assemble his 500,000 men in Washington, possibly a year from now, with the expectation that such a show of force would enable it to take over the governme nt peacefully in a few days.\" During his last talk with MacGuire , Butler had once more pressured him to explain the persistent bond sa lesman's personal stake in the conspiracy."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" 162 The Plot to Seize the White House BUTLER: I asked him again, \"Why are you in this thing?\" He said, \"I am a business man. I have got a wife and children.\" in other words, he had had a nice trip to Europe with his family, for nine months, and he said th at that cost plenty, too. . . . So he left me, saying, \"I am going down to Miami and I will get in touch with you after the conven tion is over, and we are going to make a fight down there for the gol d standard, and we are going to organize.\" After he had been urged over forty times to accept the leadership of the Fascist coup d'etat being planned, while he gathered as much information about it as he could, Butle r had then sought to gather corroborative evidence through reporter Pa ul Comly French. BUTLER: ... in talking to Paul French here-I had not said anything about this other thing, it did not make any difference about fiddling with the gold standard reso lution, but this [t he Fascist plot] looked to me as though it might be getting near that they were going to stir some of these soldiers up to hurt our Government. I did not know anything about this committee [the Am erican Liberty League], so I told Paul to let his newspaper see what they could find out about the background of these fellows. Although Butler recalled having indu ced French to check into the case, former Philadelphia Record city editor Tom O'Neil gave the author his recollection that Bu tler had approached him and told him the whole story. O'Neil recalled that he had agreed to assign French to investigate. Probably Butler first approached French , who had referred him to the city editor. Butler gave the McCormack-Dickst ein Committee his view that the plot might have been hatched out of a racket that MacGuire had been working as a moneymaking scheme. BUTLER: I felt that it was just a racket, that these fellows were working one another and getting mone y out of the rich, selling them gold bricks. I have been in 752 different"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"The Conspiracy Explodes 163 towns in the United States in thre e years and one month, and I made 1,022 speeches. I have seen absolute ly no sign of anything showing a trend for a change of our form of Government. So it has never appealed to me at all. But as long as there was a lot of money stirring around-and I had noticed some of th em with money to whom I have talked were dissatisfied and talking about having dictators-I thought that perhaps they might be tempted to put up money. Butler testified that his last en counter with MacGuire had been reference to French's attempt to talk to him. CHAIRMAN: Did you have any further talks with him? BUTLER: No. The only other time I saw or heard from him was when I wanted Paul to uncover him. He talked to me and he telephoned Paul, saying he wanted to see him. He called me up and asked if Paul was a reputable person, and I said he was. That is the last thing I heard from him. CHAIRMAN: The last ta lk you had with MacGuire was in the Bellevue in Augu st of this year? BUTLER: August 22; yes. Th e date can be identified. He concluded his testimony by ur ging the committee to question several persons about the plot in a ddition to MacGuire -notably Murphy, Doyle, and Legion Commander Frank N. Belgrano. This request was also stricken from the official record. Butler was aware that Chairm an McCormack was himself a Legionnaire and that th e revelations of the pl ot implicating Legion officials might be painful to him. But Butler also knew that McCormack was a determined foe of Nazi propaga nda and a staunch supporter of New Deal measures. Butler counted on hi s indignation over the conspiracy to bring about a full-scale investigati on by the Departme nt of justice."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"164 The Plot to Seize the White House 5 After Butler had completed his testimony, Paul Comly French took the witness chair to report on his own inve stigation of the plot, in which a candid two-hour conversation with MacGui re at the latter's office figured prominently. Describing these talks on the prem ises of Grays on M.-P. Murphy and Company, Fr ench verified ever y allegation about th e plot the general had attributed to MacGui re. In addition French reported the more open statements MacGuire had made to him about the nature of the conspiracy and how it would work. More frank with French, apparently, than he had dared to be with the gene ral, MacGuire made little attempt to disguise the Fascist nature of the proposed putsc h with euphemistic phrases about \"supporting the President.\" FRENCH: We need a Fascist gove rnment in this country, he insisted, to save the Nation from th e Communists who want to tear it down and wreck all that we have built in Ameri ca. The only men who have the patriotism to do it are the soldiers and Smedley Butler is the ideal leader. He could orga nize a million men overnight. During the conversation he told me he had been in Italy and Germany during the summer of 1934 and the spring of 1934 and had made an intensive study of the b ackground of the Nazi and Fascist movements and how the veterans had pl ayed a part in them. He said he had obtained enough information on the Fascist and Nazi movements and of the part played by the vetera ns, to properly set up one in this country. He emphasized throughout his co nversation with me that the whole thing was tremendously patriotic, that it was saving the Nation from Communists, and that the me n they deal with have that crackbrained idea that the Communists "},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"The Conspiracy Explodes 165 are going to take it apart.

Censored in French's testimony was his revela tion of the sources to which MacGuire had said that he could turn for the funds to finance the veterans' army. † FRENCH: He said he could go to John W. Davis [attorney for J. P. Morgan and Company] or Perk ins of the National City Bank, and any number of persons to get it. Of course, that may or may not mean anything. That is, his reference to John W. Davis and Perkins of the National City Bank. French testified that MacGuire ha d sought to impress him by indicating high-level support for the conspiracy from important movers and shakers of the American Legion. FRENCH: He then pushed a letter across the desk and said that it was from Louis Johnson, a form er national commander of the American Legion. CHAIRMAN: Did he s how you the letter? FRENCH: I did not read it. He just passed it over so I could see it, but he did not show it to me. He said that he had discussed the matter with him along the lines of what we were now discussing, and I took it to mean that he had talked of this Fascist proposition with Johnson, and Johnson wa s in sympathy with it.

FRENCH: That is precisely the impression I gained from him. As MacGuire had grown increasingl y comfortable with him, French testified, the plotter had grown candi d and enthusiastic about the Fascist rewards that would follow seizure of the White House. Fr ench's use of the word \"brilliant\" in th e following portion of testimony was obviously sarcastic. FRENCH: He had a very brilliant solution of the unemployment situation. He said that Roosevelt had muffed it te rrifically, bu t that he had the plan. He had seen it in Europe. It was a pl an that Hitler had used in putting all of the unemployed in labor camps or barracks-enforced labor. That would solve it overnight, and he said that when th ey got into power, that is what th ey would do; that that was the ideal plan. He had another suggest ion to register all persons all over the country, like they do in Europe. He said that w ould stop a lot of these Communist agitators who were running ar ound the country. He said that a crash was inevita ble and was due to come when bonds reached 5 pe rcent. He said that the soldiers must prepare to save the Nation. If Roosevelt went along with the dictatorship as the King had done in Italy, MacGuire had suggested, Butler coul d have the proposed labor camps put under his own control. † FRENCH: . . . he suggested th at Roosevelt would be in sympathy with us and prop osed the idea that Butl er would be named as the head of the C.C.C.

French then testified that MacGuire had told him the plotters could obtain arms and equipment from the Remington Arms Company, on credit through the Du Ponts. Hi s testimony also implicat ed the American Liberty League. † FRENCH: I do not think at th at time he mentioned the connection of Du Ponts with the American Liberty League, but he skirted all around it. That is, I do not think he mentioned the Liberty League, but he skirted all around the idea that that was the back door; one of the Du Ponts is on the board of directors of the American Liberty League and they own a controlling in terest in the Remi ngton Arms Co. . . . He said the General would no t have any tro uble enlisting 500,000 men. It was because MacGuire saw the gene ral as the indispen sable man of the putsch, French testified, that he pe rsisted in his efforts to win Butler's adherence to the scheme. FRENCH: When I left him he said that he planned to get in touch with the general and again try to persuade him to ac cept the leadership of this organization; that he was going to Miami in a couple of weeks for the national convention to do a little work. CHAIRMAN: To beat the bonus? FRENCH: Yes. CHAIRMAN: I thought he was for the bonus. FRENCH: He was at first. BUTLER (interposing): He wants it paid in gold. Clark told me that he had been for the bonus or that he would be for the bonus if we could get the gold standard restored. FRENCH: Then he said he would be in Miami. I told him that the general was going out on a rather lengthy speaking tour and did not know how to get to him. He said that he would either see him before he went to Miami or, if he could not, after he came back from Miami. But he did not see him and in a couple of days the general went out West.

At this time he said that he was extremely sorry that he could not get to Newt own Square [Butler's home town], but hoped to do so soon; that things were moving nicely. Everything is coming our way, is the way he expressed it. 6 That same afternoon th e committee grilled Jerry MacGuire, who had also been summoned to testify at the executive session. MacGuire, who earned only $150 a week as a bond salesman, contradicted himself on the amount of money he had receiv ed from sponsors and what he had done with it. He denied Butler's alle gation that he had thrown eighteen thousand-dollar bills on the bed at the Newark hotel during the 29th Division convention to bribe Butler into going to the Legion convention in Chicago. But he could not explain what he had done with at least thirty thousand in letters of credit, funds advanced to him by either Clark or Clark's attorney, Albert Grant Chri stmas, and which MacGuire had had with him at the Legion convention in Chicago the following October, at which he had been both a delegate and a member of the \"distinguished guest committee.\" The McCormack-Dickstein Committee found five significant facts that lent validity to Butler's testim ony. Clark, who wanted the Legion to pass a gold-standard resolution, had gi ven MacGuire those funds. In the long-distance call Clark had allegedly made to Chicago while Butler was listening, he had instructed MacGuire, \"You can put this thing across alone. You've got $45,000.

Corroboration of Butler's testimony about MacGuire's mission in Europe was borne out by the committee' s finding that he had spent large sums of money on that trip to study Fascist movements in Italy, Germany, and France. Th e committee found, too, that he and Clark had handled large sums of money for vari ous organizations, that he had been active in organizations mentioned by Butler, and that he had acted as cashier for one organization. His accounts of some of these financial transactions failed to satisfy the comm ittee, and he was curtly instructed to reappear the following da y for further questioning. Interviewed by reporters afterward, MacGuire declared that he was a personal friend of General Butler's and had last seen him six months earlier when he had gone to Philadelp hia to sell some bonds. They had talked about an adequate military force for the nation, MacGuire insisted, and about world affairs in general, but he denied ever discussing a Fascist army or move ment. A little desperately MacGuire suggested that \"General Butler must be seeking publicity ,\" and called the general's testimony \"a pacifist stunt:\" His attorney, Norman L. Marks, called it \"a joke and a publicity stunt for General Butler.\" 7 Smedley Butler's reputation as an honest patriot made what he had testified to under oath impossible for the press to ignore.

Instead of beginning with a full account of his charges, there wa s only a brief para graph restating the facts in the headline. This was followed by a whole string of denials, or ridicule of the charges, by prominen t people implicated. Extensive space was given to their attempts to brand Bu tler a liar or lunatic. Only at the tail of the story, buried inside the paper, did the Times wind up its account with a few brief paragraphs mentioning some of his allegations. Many papers that picked up the st ory dropped the tail carrying even those cursory details of the plot. News paper publishers had little reason to be fond of the firebrand general who, in his speech to veterans in Atlanta almost a year earlier, had warned them not to believe the capitalist- controlled press, which, Butler char ged, suppressed facts unfavorable to America's powerful corporations. The New York Times did note, however, that Butler had told friends in Philadelphia that General Hu gh S. Johnson, former N.R.A. administrator, had been among those slated for the role of di ctator if Butler turned it down and that J. P. Mo rgan and Company and Grayson M.-P. Murphy and Company were both involved in the plot. \"It's a joke-a publicity stunt,\" Jerry MacGuire was quoted as insisting. \"I know noth ing about it. The matter is made up out of whole cloth.

He insisted that in 1932 he had voted for President Roosevelt, the target of the alleged plot. Asked about these denial s, Butler snorted to a New York Times reporter, \"Hell, you're not surprised they deny it, are you? What they have to say they'll say before the committee. \" He wanted them under oath, as lie had been. In Washington General Douglas Ma cArthur, Chief of Staff, was unavailable for comment because of a real or a diplomatic \"heavy cold.\" His aides, however, expressed amazeme nt and amusement that MacArthur had been named by Butler as an alternate choice of the plotters for dictator if Butler persisted in refusing the offer. \"All the principals in the case,\" George Seldes noted in his book Facts and Fascism, \"were American Legion officials and financial backers.\" Secretary of War George H.

Both McCormack and Dickstein emphasized that the general had repulsed all proposals from the Fascist group. Dickstein indicated that about sixteen persons mentioned to the committee by Butler would be subpoenaed and that an open hearing might be held within a week. 8 Returning frorn Washington, Butler wa s besieged by reporters at his home in Newtown Square. \"My name has been used all around the country by organizations,\" he told them. \"They'd get some vets and say, `See, we have Butler with us.' They were using me . The investigators who ha ve been running this thing down found my name popping up ev erywhere, so they wanted to know what I knew about it-and I'm not the only man in this thing.\" Next day Dr. W. D.

I have been looking for just this attempt at a Wall St. coup if your policies looked like succeeding. Wall St. is the enemy of our govt. and Butler is giving it to you straight-don't doubt that for a minute. The writer was unable to ascertai n the identity of Dr. Brooks, but apparently his opinion carried some we ight at the White House, because Louis Howe referred his wire to Attorney General Homer S.

MacGuire testified that as far as he knew, Clark had never had any interest in a Fascist organizatio n. But the McCo rmack-Dickstein Committee located letters from MacGui re written from Europe to Clark and Christmas that proved otherwise. To many questions thrown at him MacGuire answered evasively, \"It is too far back,\" or \"I cannot recall.\" At the conclusion of his testimony Dickstein told reporter s that MacGuire was \"hanging himself\" by contradictions in his story and by forced admissions made during his testimony. When this op inion was quoted in a few evening newspapers, Dickstein observed that he had meant it to be \"off the - record.\" Norman L. Marks, the attorney who had accompanied Mac Guire at the secret hearings, told reporters that MacG uire had denied ever having had any connection with any Fascist organization of any sort; that he had ever been th e \"cashier\" for any Fascist group; or that he had gone to Europe to study the Fasc ist movement.

If he had written such a letter, Johnson insist ed, it would show that he and the Legion were unalterably op posed to any dictatorship.

Evidence was found that the day before MacG uire had allegedly seen Butler in Newark, he had draw n six thousand dollars m thousand- dollar bills from a \"s pecial account\" in the Manufacturers Trust Company and had also been given ten thousa nd dollars in thousand- dollar bills by Christmas in Cl ark's presence. The committee was convinced that MacGuire had been the \"cashier\" for the planned veterans organization. The committee also fo und evidence that disproved MacGuire's alibi that he had been in Chicago on September 24, as well as his contention that he had no t seen Butler on that da y at the Newark hotel. And it was established beyond disp ute that he had written detailed letters to Clark and Christmas reporting on the Black Shir ts of Italy, the Brown Shirts of Germany, and the Croix de Feu of France. McCormack announced grimly that he would subpoena Clark as soon as he returned from Euro pe. \"As the eviden ce stands,\" he declared, \"it calls for an explan ation that the co mmittee has been unable to obtain from Mr. MacGuire.\" On November 26, 1934, referr ing to MacGuire's testimony,"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"The Conspiracy Explodes 183 Representative Dickstei n declared, \"You can' t get away from it - somebody is trying to shield somebody on someth ing that looks rotten, and honest people don't do that.\" 11 When the committee called no furt her witnesses from among those named in the testimony, gossip swept Washington that the uncalled witnesses were simply too powerful to be subpoenaed. Investigating, reporter John Spiv ak learned that the only one known to have been called to test ify was California banker Frank N. Belgrano, commander of the Ameri can Legion. Checking into why he had not testified, Spivak found that he had been informed he could return home without having to answer a single questi on. The reporter could not verify a ru mor that Belgrano had met with President Roosevelt at the White House, afte r which he had been taken off the committee's hook. When Spivak tried to learn more about this from the committee itself, Dickstein reveal ed that he didn't know why Belgrano had been sent home without being questione d, and McCormack declined to answer any question s on the subject. Apparently in response to Spivak and other newsmen pressing for an explanation of what the committ ee was doing about Butler's charges, McCormack announced on November 2,5 that the committee would make a statement the ne xt day detailing the te stimony it ha d received. He declared that it would reveal \" several important inconsistencies\" between the testimony of MacGuire a nd statements attrib uted to him in the press. McCormack also went out of his way to emphasize vigorously that General Butler c ould not be accused of \"publicity seeking\" in making public his exposure of the plot.

Smedley D. Butler at the head of a Fascist army here, Representative Samuel Dickstein, vice chairman, said yesterday. The committee's statement of the evidence, he e xplained, was intended only to satisfy the great publ ic interest in the plot. Mr. Dickstein said that the committee was pleased that this preliminary report was received \"neither as a whitewash of notable persons nor as sensationalism because of the startling nature of the possibilities, but simply as an indication of the purpose of the committee to proceed carefully in such an important matter.\" Dickstein emphasized that the co mmittee was far from satisfied with the story told by MacGuire, w hose memory had failed to produce any satisfactory account of the funds that he had handled for Clark and Christmas. Furthermore, although Cl ark and Christmas had cabled from abroad that they were willing to return to testify, Dickstein said that they had not done so and that the co mmittee would like to question them both.

I take it that the committee will proceed further.\" 12 On December 3, 1934, Time magazine ran a first-pa ge story that attempted to ridicule Butler under th e headlines \"Plot Without Plotters.\" The story opened with a pseudoaccount of Bu tler on a white horse assembling 500,00o veterans at a C.C.C. camp at Elkridge, Maryland, and crying, \"Men, Washington is but 30 miles away! Will you follow me?\" The men all shout, \"We wi ll!\" Then Butler 's army marches south to Washington on Highway 1 while an ammunition train supplied by Remington Arms Company and E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company brings up the rear. Also in the column on horseback behind Butler, according to Time's burlesqued version of the plot, are \"that grim, old-ti me cavalryman, General Hugh Samuel John son\" and MacArthur; be hind them, three past national commanders of the Americ an Legion-MacNider, Johnson, and Henry Stevens. They are followed in a shiny limousine by J. P. Morgan and his partner, Th omas W. Lamont. Then, in Time's parody, Butler (\"his spur s clinked loudly\") strides into Roosevelt's study and barks, \"Mr. President, I have 500,000 men outside who want peace but want something more . I wish you to remove Cordell Hull as Secretar y of State.\" Roosevelt promptly telephones for Hull's resignation. \"And now, Mr. Presiden t, I ask you to fill the vacancy which has just occurred in your Cabinet by appointing me Secretary of State.\" Roosevelt signs the commission for Butler, who then tells him, \"Let it be understood that hencefor th I will act as the"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"The Conspiracy Explodes 187 nation's executive.

In that event, as Secretary of State, I shall succeed to the Pr esidency, as provided by law.\" The President nods assent, and th e United States becomes a Fascist state. Time then commented: Such was the nightmarish page of future United States history pictured last week in Manhattan by General Butler himself to the special House Committee investig ating un-American Activities. No military officer of the United States since the late tempestuous George Custer has succeeded in publicly flounde ring in so much hot water as Smedley Darlington Butler. Time then recounted highlights of Bu tler's career, emphasizing the controversies he had never shied away from and implying that they arose solely from the general's taste for publicity. Last month he told a Manhattan Jewish congregation that he would never again fight outside the U.S. General Butler's sensational tongue had not been heard in the nation's Press for more than a week when he cornered a reporter for the Philadelphia Record and New York Post, poured into his ears the luri d tale that he had been offered leadership of a Fascist Putsch scheduled for next year. . . . Thanking their stars for having such sure-fire publicity dropped in their laps, Representatives Mc Cormack and Dickstein began calling witnesses to expose the \"plot.\" Bu t there did not seem to he any plotters. A bewildered army captain, comm andant at the Elkridge CCC camp, could shed no light on the re port that his post was to be turned into a revolutionary base. Mr. Morgan, just off a boat from Europe, had nothing to say, but Partner Lamont did: \"Perfect moons hine! Too utterly ridiculous to comment upon!\" . . .

Though most of the country was again laughing at the latest Butler story, the specia l House Committee declin ed to join in the merriment. . . . \"From present indi cations,\" said the publicity-loving New York Representative [Dickste in], \"General Butler has the evidence. He's not making serious ch arges unless he has something to back them up. We will have some men here with bigger names than Butler's before this is over.\" For those of its reader s who might have found Time's satirical attack too subtle, the magazine helped them get the message by its choice of photos to accompany the story. An unflattering photo of Butler in civilian clothes, with his finger refl ectively in one ear, was labeled, \"He was deaf to a dictatorship .\" The pose subtly suggested that the general, as the copy broadly hint ed, was a bit daft. In contrast, a jovial, laughing pict ure of that good-natured, genial humanitarian, J. P. Morgan, looki ng like everybody's gr andfather, was labeled, \"Moons hine provided the amusement. \" And a stern, handsome picture of Colonel Grayson M.-P. Murp hy, dressed in a trim World War I colonel's uniform, hand dashingly on hi p, was captioned with this quote: \"'A fantasy!\"' The author asked McCo rmack in 1971 about Time's fairness in reporting the Butler hearing. The answer was a snort of disgust. \"Time has always been about as filthy a public ation as ever existed,\" he said emphatically. \"I've said that public ly many times. The truth gets no coverage at all, just sensationalism, whatever will sell copies.\" Indignant on Butler's behalf, the Ne w York City post of the V.F.W. sent President Roosevelt a wire on December 7 ple dging their loyalty and support, and commending Butler fo r his courage and patriotism in exposing the conspirators.

CHRISTMAS: The committee gave me some indication of such testimony at a previous session. MCCORMACK: Assuming he has te stified to that, that is not so? CHRISTMAS: I would say he is in error.

However, I can guess how it came about, but it did no harm.\" 14 The storm of controversy over his exposure of th e plot led radio station WCAU of Philadelphia, Pennsylvan ia, to urge Butler to make broadcasts for them two to four nights a week. He agreed, and beginning on January 4 took to the airwaves with hard-hitting attacks on Fascist plotters. What he had to say was impressive enough to make small headlines in the back pages of newspapers sufficiently often to generate enthusiastic support from the nation's veterans. On January 7 the Miami, Oklahom a, post of V.F.W. passed a resolution: \"Major General Smedle y D. Butler should be commended for his high type of patriotism in ex posing the alleged plot to establish a dictatorship in the United States, and . . . Franklin D.

No evidence was presented and this committee had none to show a connection between this effort and any fascist activity of any European country. There is no question that these attempts were discussed, were planned, and might have been pl aced in execution when and if the financial backers deemed it expedient. This committee received evidence from Maj. Gen Smedley D. Butler (retired), twice decorated by the Congress of the United States. He testified before the committee as to conversations with one Gerald C. MacGuire in which the latter is alleged to have suggested the formation of a fascist army under th e leadership of General Butler (p. 9-114 D.C. 6 II). "},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"The Conspiracy Explodes 193 MacGuire denied these allegations under oath, but your committee was able to verify all the pertinent statements made by General Butler,* with the exception of the direct statement suggesting the creation of the organization. This, however, was corroborated in the correspondence of MacGuire with his principal, Robert Sterling Clark, of New York City, while MacGuire was abroad studying the various forms of veterans organizations of Fascist character (p. 111 D.C. 611). There was also corroboration of this point in French's testimony. The committee then cited an excerpt fr om the letter MacGuire had written to Clark and Christmas from France pr aising the Croix de Feu as a model veterans or ganization. This committee asserts that an y efforts based on lines as suggested in the foregoing and leading off to the extreme right, are just as bad as efforts which would lead to the extreme left. Armed forces for the purpose of establishing a dictatorship by means of Fascism or a dictatorship through the instrumentality of the proleteriat, or a dictatorship predicated on racial and religious hatreds, have no place in this country. This total vindication of Butler did not burst like a bombshell across the front pages of America. Instead, as Seldes noted, \"Most newspapers again suppresse d or buried or belittled the official verdict.\" The New York Times made no mention of the plot in its headlines on the committee's report, emphasizing instead the committee's proposal that all foreign propaga ndists-Fascist, Nazi, a nd Communist-be compelled to register with the State Department. In the fifth and sixth paragraphs of the story the Times briefly reported: It also alleged that definite pr oof had been found that the much publicized Fascist march on Washingt on, which was to have been led by Major Gen.

Spivak had been tipped off earlier by a fellow Washington correspondent that some of Butler' s testimony had been deleted in the committee's November 26, 1934 report to the House of Representatives, and not for national security reasons. Spivak determined to get a look at the complete uncensored record of the testimony given at the executive session. He had asked for permission to s ee it, in order to follow up leads on Nazi activities in the United States, but he had been turned down on grounds that no one outside the co mmittee and its employees could sec transcripts of testimony taken in executive session. Other newsmen, however, joined him in pressing for a copy of the Butler testimony. It was then that the defunct McCormack-Dickstein Committee, possibly to quiet persiste nt rumors about why it was being hushed up, decided to publish a 12 5-page document containing the testimony of Butler, McGuire, and ot hers, on February 15, 1935. It was marked \"Extracts,\" and the last page explained why: In making public the foregoing evidence, which was taken in executive session in New York C ity from November 20 to 24, inclusive, the committee has ordered stricken there-from certain immaterial and incompetent evidence, or evidence which was not pertinent to the inquiry, and whic h would not have been received during a public hearing."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"The Conspiracy Explodes 195 Spivak's newshawk instincts di d not let him fully accept this explanation, because he knew that the committee had published hearsay evidence. Like a terrier worrying a rag do ll, he persisted in trying to find out what evidence had b een cut. Other questions nagged at him. Why had the committee at first announced it would subpoena all those named by Butler, only to declare later that it had no evidence on which to question them? Was the clue to this abrupt change of mind to be found in the censored testimony? A veteran Washington co rrespondent told Spivak that he had heard the deletions had been made at the request of a member of the President's Cabinet. The implication was that release of certain names could embarrass the Democratic party, because two had been unsuccessful Democratic candidates for the Presidency -John W. Davis, the Morgan lawyer, and A1 Smith, governor of New York before Roosevelt. Davis had been named in the comm ittee's press release, but not A1 Smith, the erstwhile \"happy warrior\" from the slums of New York who had become codirector with Irenee du Pont in the American Liberty League, and a bitter critic of Roos evelt's liberalism and New Deal reform. Spivak tried everything to check out the story but found himself up against a brick wall at every turn. He had been tipped off earlier that the House of Representatives intended to let the McCormack-Dick stein Committee expire on January 3, 1935, rather than renew it as th e committee had asked in order to continue its investigations. And die the committee did. About a week later, seeking to do a story on its accomplishments in exposing Nazi and anti-Semitic act ivities in the United States, Spivak won permission from Dickstein to examine the committee's official exhibits and make photostatic copies of those that had been made public. Dickstein wrote a letter to this effect to the committee's secretary, Frank P. Randolph, and added, \"If necessa ry consult John [McCormack] about it.\" Randolph, flooded with work involv ed in closing the committee's files and records, gave Spivak st acks of documents, exhibits, and transcripts of testimony that were being sent to"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" 196 The Plot to Seize the White House the Government Printing Office. To Spivak's amazement, he found among these records a full transcript of the executive session hearings in the Butler affair. Excited by this accidental stroke of luck, he compared it with the official extract of the hearings and found a number of startling omissions made from the testimony of both Butl er and French, some of which could not be justified on grounds of hearsay ev idence. Spivak copied down the censored material. In 1971 I asked former Speaker McCormack if he could recall, after thirty-four years, the reasons fo r these omissions fr om the official record of the testimony at the hearings. \"I don't recall striking anything from the record,\" he told me, \"but if I did, it was because I tried to be as careful as I could about hearsay evidence in open hearings. Executive h earings were different. We'd let people say anything there because we'd get lots of valuable tips to follow up that way. But in open hearings I in sisted that all the evidence had to be pertinent, relevant, and germane- evidence that would stand up in a courtroom to the nth degree. I don't think all investigative committees follow this method, but they should. I wanted to be very careful about safeguarding the character of anyone who might be named, without hard evidence, by a witness in testimony at an open hearing, so if somebody gave hearsay evidence, I wo uld say, `Strike it out.\"' Omissions from the official record of some revelations from the testimony of Butler and French gave the American press, with a few minor exceptions, a legitimate excuse to keep silent about them. It was significant that none of the biggest ne wspaper chains or wire services saw fit to assign crack reporters to dig into what was obviously one of the biggest news stories of the decade. John L. Spivak could not help wondering why MacGuire, the key to the plot, had not been compelled to testify on where and how he had obtained his advance inside informa tion about AI Smith's plans, Hugh Johnson's firing, and the appearance of the American Liberty League; or why he had not been asked to reveal the sources of his information about the Morgan and Du Pont intere sts' involvement in the plot."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"The Conspiracy Explodes 197 Worst of all, no one involved in the plot had been prosecuted. Spivak went to the Department of ju stice and pointed out that MacGuire had denied essential parts of Butle r's testimony, which the committee itself reported it had proved by docum ents, bank records, and letters. Did the department intend to file a crim inal prosecution against MacGuire for perjury or involvement in the plot? \"I was told,\" Spivak reported, \"it had no plans to prosecute.\" Roger Baldwin, director of the Amer ican Civil Liberties Union, issued an angry statement on the curious ap athy of the justice Department in punishing any of the miscreants: The Congressional Committee investigating un-American activities has just reported that the Fascist plot to seize the government . . . was proved; yet not a single participant will be prosecuted under the perfectly pl ain language of the federal conspiracy act making this a high cr ime.

Which is, of course, only to emphasize the nature of our government as representative of th e interests of the controllers of property. Violence, even to the seizure of government, is excusable on the part of those whose lofty motive is to preserve the profit system. . . . Powerful influences had obviously been brought to bear to cut short the hearings, stop subpoenas from being issued to all the important figures involved, and end the life of the committee. The Philadelphia Record, which broke the story by French, had these observations in an editorial: General Butler deserves the highest praise for recognizing the significance of the offers made to hi m, and the menace they represent. \"I'm a democrat, not a Fascist,\" General Butler says, \"and I was sick and tired of being linked by rumor to this Fascist movement and that one.

The Record condemned phony \"popular\" movements like the National Economy League, a front for big business, and added: Some of the same interests behind the League, according to General Butler, are behind this effort to use him and his soldier following in defense of special privilege in America. The same people who succeeded in slashing aid to vete rans would like to use those same veterans as their pawns in a war on democracy. The folk who want Fascism in this country are the same folk who made profit while others bled and who would rather see the veteran starve than unbalance the budget, i.e., add to the burden of taxes on great wealth. They did it in Italy. They did it in Germany. They did it in Austria. They will try to do it in America. . . . General Butler has nipped one such movement in the bud. John L. Spivak had shrewd observations about the reasons the conspirators had failed dismally in their treason: The takeover plot failed because though those involved had astonishing talents for making breat htaking millions of dollars, they lacked an elementary understanding of people and the moral forces that activate them. In a money-standard civilization such as ours, the universal regard for anyone who is rich tends to persuade some millionaires that they are knowledgeable in fields other than the making of money.

It is conceivable that some of those named by MacGuire as under consideration for the role of dict ator or subordinate posit ions of leadership had no knowledge of this fact, although Va n Zandt reported that he, for one, had been approach ed. It is unlikely that Douglas MacArthur, as Chief of Staff and a stiff-necked hero with patriotic credentials as unchallengeable as Butler's, would have had any unsavory dealings with the plotters, however patricia n his outlook. As for involvement of the Am erican Legion, MacGuire had obviously been influential enough in th e organization to have been made chairman of the \"distingui shed guest committee\" of its convention, on the staff of National Commande r Louis Johnson, former Secretary of Defense and head of a large law firm in Clarksburg, West Virginia. There is solid evidence that MacGuire had been able to use the Legion to do multimillionaire Robert S. Clark's bidding and get the Legion to pass a resolution demandi ng a return to the gold standard. MacGuire was certainly financed by Clark, Christmas, Walter E.

Butler te stified that Clar k had implicated John W. Davis, attorney for J. P. Morgan and Company, as author of the speech Clark had given MacGuire to get Butler to deliver at the Legion convention. Davis was the sa me man from whom MacGuire had declared he could easil y raise a million dollars for his Fascist army. MacGuire had also revealed to Butle r that the same financial interests who had been behind the gold-standard propaganda were financing the plot to seize the White House. The formation of the American Liberty League had been an- nounced precisely at th e time MacGuire had pred icted the emergence of an organization of \"big fellows\" wh o were in the b ackground of the Fascist putsch. Its treasurer had been none other than Colonel Grayson M.-P. Murphy. One of its financial backers was Robert S. Clark. Two of the largest contributors had been the J. P. Morgan Associates and the Du Pont interests. John W. Da vis was a member of the National Executive Committee. Morgan and Du Pont men were directors. And MacGuire had told French that th e putsch could ob tain arms and equipment from the Remington Arms Company, in which the Du Ponts held a controlling interest, on credit through the Du Ponts.

His alliance with Raskob and the Du Ponts in the League brought charges that he had \"forsaken the brown derby for the top hat.\" When he failed to stop Roos evelt's renomination in 1936, he stumped for Republican candidate Alf Landon, losing much of his former popularity in the process and speaking to dwindling, hostile audiences. Were all the interlacing connec tions linking MacGuire, Clark, Colonel Murphy, and the Morgan and Du Pont interests to the plot only a series of remarkable coincidences? If so, another unique coincidence led the American Liberty League to subsidize su ch affiliated organizations as the openly Fascis t and anti-Semitic Sentinels of the Republic and the Crusader s, who were urged by th eir leader, George W.

Roosevel t had been compelled to turn to \"fireside chats\" over the radio in or der to communicate with the American people over the heads of the press lords. In that emotional climate it was not at all surprising that some elements of big business should have sought to emulate their counterparts in Germany and Italy, suppor ting a Fascist putsch to take over the government and run it under a dictator on behalf of America's bankers and industrialists.

McCormack had no fear of talking to a reporter from the New Masses, for which Spivak was writing at the time. Communis-toriented or not, McCormack knew that the Masses was in the forefront of exposing N azi and anti-Semitic activities in the United States. Asked about the deleted testimony, Mc Cormack at first suggested that Spivak was relying on gossip. When Spivak revealed and convinced McCormack that he had 'seen the tran script of the executive session, the congressman grew annoyed and canceled the interview. He agreed to let Spivak leave questions with him, howev er, and said he would reply to those he chose to answer within three days. Writing Spivak a letter three days later, he gave no specific answers to questions about the American Libe rty League, the American Legion's passage of the gold resolution, and th e report that John W. Davis had written the speech that MacGuire and Cl ark had wanted Butler to make. \"The reason for certain portions of General Butler's testimony in executive session being deleted from the publ ic record,\" he wrote, \"has been clearly stated in the public record.\" He went on to make a broad attack against the plotters and to suggest that the hearings had defeated them: \"A s a result of the investigation, and the disclosures made, this movement has be en stopped, and is practically broken up.

I would have had no hesitation in going after the Morgans.\" \"You had Belgrano, commander of the Am erican Legion, listed to testify. Why wasn't he examined?\" \"I don't know,\" Dickstein replied, a nd referred him back to McCormack for the answer. 2 Spivak decided to inform General Butler, who, he was sure, did not realize it, that portions of his and French 's testimony had been omitted in the official report issued by the McCorm ack-Dickstein Committee. \"If he knew and said so publicly,\" Sp ivak reasoned, \"h e would reach a vastly greater audience than was availa ble to me through the New Masses.\" Telephoning the general, Spivak announced that he was from the New Masses and wanted to see him about his testimony. \"Come on out,\" Butler said promptly. \"Glad to see you. \" The roads had not been cleared of a heavy snowfall of the night before, and Spivak trudged to the house in Newtown Square through knee-deep sn ow.

He liked Butle r instantly, and the feeling was apparently mutual. During their talk Butler revealed that he wa s intensely preoccupied with the corporate exploita tion of the military for profit. Anxious to arouse Americans to this spoliation, he now believed it might be done by a more sophisticated book of memoirs and reflections than Old Gimlet Eye. \"I think you're the man I've been h oping to run into to help me do an autobiography,\" he told Spivak. \"There are things I've seen, things I've learned that should not be left unsaid . War is a racket to protect economic interests, not our country, and our soldiers are sent to die on foreign soil to protect investments by big business.\" Spivak said regretfully that he felt compelled to continue in- vestigating and exposing a more ur gent and dangerous situation -Nazi activities in the United St ates. Butler agreed at onc e that this activity was more important and offered to help by opening any doors he could for Spivak. During their discussion Spivak learned \"thing s about big business and politics, sometimes in earthy, four-l etter words, the like of which I had never heard.\" Butler spi lled over with a nger at the hypocrisy that had marked American interferen ce in the internal affairs of other governments, behind a smoke screen of pious ex pressions of high-sounding purpose. \"We supervised elections in Haiti,\" he said wryly, \"and wherever we supervised them our ca ndidate always won.\" Admiring Butler's candor, Spivak did not want to mislead him or sail under false colors. He reminded th e general that he was from the New Masses, and in case Butler didn't know it, added, \"It's supposed to be a Communist magazine.\" \"So who the hell cares?\" Butler sh rugged. \"There wouldn't be a United States if it wasn't for a bunch of radicals. I once heard of a radical named George Washington. As a matter of fact from what I read he was an extremist-a goddam revolutionist!\" Because of his fierce anti -Fascist and anti-big- business views, Butler was sometimes Red-baited.

His scowl deepened as Spivak revealed that Belgrano had been dismissed w ithout being asked a single question about what had happened at the \" gold-standard resolution\" Legion convention in Chicago. According to Spivak, upon lear ning that the committee had reported to Congress that it had verifi ed the authenticity of the plot, yet no action had been taken about MacG uire's wholesale denials under oath, Butler lost control of his volatile temper. \"I'll be goddammed!\" he roared. \"Y ou can be sure I'm going to say something about this!\" Spivak asked him to hold off long enough to let the tiny - circulation New Masses break the story first. Butler agreed. When the Masses appeared with the expose, it wa s a sensational news scoop, but none of the Washington correspondent s dared touch it or follow it up. \"Several expressed regret,\" Spivak related, \"that the exposes were appearing in the New Masses; when they quoted from one of my stories- solely on its news value-their edito rs cut the material out and advised them that quotes from `that magazine ' might make readers say the paper was spreading Red propaganda.

The committee, he growled, had \"stopped d ead in its tracks when it got near the top.\" He added angrily: Like most committees, it has slaughtered the little and allowed the big to escape. The big shots we ren't even called to testify. Why wasn't Colonel Grayson M.-P. Mu rphy, New York broker ... called? Why wasn't Louis Howe, Secretary to the President of the United States, called? . . . Why wasn't A1 Smith called? And why wasn't Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Chief of Staff of the United States Army, called? And why wasn't Hanford MacNider, former American Legion commander, called? They were a ll mentioned in the testimony. And why was all mention of these names suppressed from the committee report? This was no piker set-up. MacGui re, who was the agent of the Wall Street bankers and brokers w ho proposed this organization, told me that $3,000,000 was \"on the line\" and that $300,000,000-and that's a lot of money even today was in vi ew to put over this plot to bluff the government. He kept up a running attack on the conspirators night after night, revealing facts that had been omitted in the official committee report. In another broadcast he lashed out at the American Legion with no holds barred: Do you think it could be hard to buy the American Legion for un-American activities?

But is the American Legion that? No sir, not while it is controlled by the bankers. For ye ars the bankers, by buying big club houses for various posts, by financing its beginning, and otherwise, have tried to make a strikebreak ing organization of the Legion. The groups-the so-called Royal Family of the Legion-which have picked its officers for years, aren't intere sted in patriotism, in peace, in wounded veterans, in those who gave their lives. . . No, they are interested only in using the veterans, through their officers. Why, even now, the commander of the American Legion is a banker-a banker who must have know n what MacGuire's money was going to be used for. His name was mentioned in the testimony. Why didn't they cal] Belgrano and ask him why he contributed? Butler was incredulous when he read that Colonel William E. Easterwood, national vice-commander of the Legion, while visiting Italy in 1935, had pinned a Legion butt on on Mussolini, making him an \"honorary member,\" and had invited the dictator to the next Legion convention in Chicago. Why, Butler wondered, did the Le gion membership stand for such an abuse of the organization in their name? Apparently an uproar of sorts did break out, because Mussolini' s honorary membership was later canceled as \"unconstitutional\" on gr ounds that the Legion had no honorary members. Representative Dickstein was given the job of replying to Butler's radio blasts in a broadcast over th e same network. The fifty-year-old congressman gave the committee's vers ion of the censored testimony: General Smedley Butler saw fit to employ this radio network to indulge in genera] criticism of the work done by the Congressional Committee on Un-American Activities and to cast aspersions on the character of such men as Alfred E.

The te stimony given by General Butler was kept confidential until such time as the names of the persons who were mentioned in his testimony could be checked upon and verified. The committee did not want to hear Ge neral Butler's allegations without giving itself the opportunity to veri fy the assertions made by him. It did not feel like dragging into the mud of publicity names of persons who were mentioned by Gene ral Butler unless his statements could be verified, since untold dama ge might be caused to a person's reputation, by public discussion of testimony which could not be substantiated. This accounts for the fact that wh en the results of the hearings were finally made public, references to Alfred E. Smith and others were omitted. They were wholly without consequence a nd public mention might be misinterpreted by the public. The essential portions, however, of General Butler's testimony have been released to the public a nd his specific charges relating to the proposed organization of a \"soldier 's movement\" have been thoroughly aired and passed upon by the committee. . . . General Butler asks why Clar k was not called before the committee. Well, the reason was that Mr . Clark has been living in France for over a year, as General Butler we ll knows, and natura lly he could not be subpoenaed, but on the 29th of December, 1934, Mr. Clark was represented before the committee in the person of his attorney, and full information was given the committee. Mr. Butler didn't tell you this. . . . 4 For whatever additional light could be shed on the plot to take over the White House that he had helped to expose, I interviewed John W.

I reminded him that the committee ha d said that it wanted to hear Clark's testimony, and Clark had stat ed that he would return from Europe to testify, bu t had not done so. Yet he had not called or subpoenaed Clark to do so. Why not? \"We couldn't subpoena Clark to testify at the executive session because they were held outside of Washington,\" McCo rmack explained. \"According to the law of that day, we had no power to subpoena anyone to executive se ssions outside the Capital. I subsequently recommended changing the law to gi ve congressional committees that right, and the change was in fact made.\"* Asked whether he knew what the reaction of President Roosevelt or Louis Howe had been to the exposu re of the plot, he replied that he did not, Why had the Department of ju stice under Attorney General Homer Cummings failed to initiate criminal pr oceedings against the plotters? \"The way I figure it, \" he replied, \"we did our job in the com- mittee by exposing the plot, and then it was up to the Department of Justice to do their job-to take it from there.\" John L. Spivak was eq ually mystified by th e lack of any action taken by the department against th e conspirators. When I asked him about it, he replied, \"I have no knowledge why the Attorney General did not pursue this matter except that most likely it was deemed politically inadvisable.\" He thought it possible that the decision might actually have been made in the White House on a basis of sheer pragmatism.

Was it avoidance of such a confrontation? Was it a desire by the head of the Demo cratic Party to avoid going into matters which could spli t the party down the middle, what with Davis and Smith, two former party heads, among those named by Butler? I asked McCormack what his ow n reactions had been to Mac- Guire's testimony denying all of Butler's allegations. \"There was no doubt that General Butler was telling the truth,\" he replied. \"We belie ved his testimony one hundr ed percent. He was a great, patriotic American in every respect.\" \"In your considered judgment, Mr. Speak er, were those men Butler named as involved in the plot guilty?\" \"Millions were at stak e when Clark and the others got the Legion to pass that resolution on the gold standard in 1933 ,\" he answered. \"When Roosevelt refused to be pressu red by it, and we nt even further off the gold standard, those fellows got desperate and decided to look into European methods, with th e idea of introducing them into America. They sent MacGuire to Europe to study the Fascist organizations. We found the evidence that Clark and [Colonel] Grayson Murphy, who underwrote the Ameri can Legion with $125,000, were involved when we examined MacGuire's r ecords and bank accounts.\" I asked him about Colonel Mu rphy's role in the plot. \"Grayson Murphy was a number-o ne kingmaker in the Legion. His firm had clients of great wealth . Those fellows were afraid that Roosevelt would take their money aw ay by taxes. They were desperate and sought to take power and frighten Roosevelt into doing what they wanted.

The same thing could have happened here:' \"How did it come about that the committee first approached Butler before he approached the committee?\" \"Oh, we heard something about it and asked the gene ral if he knew anything,\" McCormack replied. \"He said he certainly did. He was giving the plotters a come-on and trying to ge t the whole story from them.

Mass frustration could bring about anything.\" He reminded me that the internationa l smell of fascism had been very much in the air during the hectic days of the plot and that much undercover Fascist activity had been going on in th e United States that the American people knew nothing about. The M cCormack-Dickstein Committee had exposed Ivy Lee, the noted public rela tions expert ostensibly employed by the German dye trust, but actually on th e payroll of the Na zi Government to help them win favorable publicity in the American press. The committee had brought about passage of the Foreign Agents' Registration Act to smoke out hidden Nazi and Soviet agents into the limelight. This committee was not the h eadline-seeking, witch-hunting extravaganza that HUAC became under Martin Dies. \"Its manner of investigation commanded special respect,\" notes historian Arthur M.

James E. Van Zandt, national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and subsequently a Republican congressman, corr oborated Butler's story an d said that he, too, had been approached by `agents of Wall Street.\"' I queried McCormack about one fina l point. One newspaper reporter had suggested that Butler had not hims elf taken the plot very seriously. \"Oh, no, General Butler regarded the plot very gravely indeed,\" McCormack said emphatically. \"He knew th at this was a threat to our very way of government by a bunch of rich men who wanted fascism.\" I also discussed this point with the Butler family. Smedley Butler, Jr., agreed with McCormack and explained why his father did not immediately go to Washington when he realized what the plotters were up to: \"Dad was not stupid. He had no proof, and he co uld not name names, so he had to be careful about it.\" In fairness to the Amer ican Legion today, it needs to be pointed out that the Legion leadership of our times is far diff erent from what it was in the period during and preced ing the Butler hearings , when so many former commanders and high officials were involved in th e conspiracy and antilabor activities dictated by big-business interests. John L.

On the podium lie held audiences fascinated not only by hi s vigorous exposes of bi g business, war-makers, the American Liberty League, and th e American Legion \"Royal Family,\" but by the sheer dynamism of his personality. As he grew more and more heat ed, he would roam the stage, gesticulating vigorously as he made his points, often extemporaneously, in salty, sometimes ribald, always blunt language. He was flooded with requests fo r appearances at huge veterans' bonus rallies staged by the V.F.W. all over the country. In his speeches to veterans he would growl at their naiveté as \"dum b soldiers\" because they didn't organize politically to fight for veterans' benefits due them. They would grin and applaud en thusiastically, knowing that behind his gruff manner was a genuine fondness and concern for their welfare. \" Acknowledged as the spokesman for the \"forgotten veteran,\" he was besieged with requests for help in ge tting adequate pensions for disabled veterans, and through the V.F.W. put pressure on the Veterans Administration in hundreds of cases. The worshipful attitude of veterans toward Butler was expressed in a typical letter to him in March, 1935, by a veteran who wrote, \"We all know that you speak our language, and that th e Vet is about as close to your heart as anything else in the world.\" There was no generation gap between the fifty-four-year-old general and youth leaders of that period, who were organizing"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"218 The Plot to Seize the White House the American Student Unio n to fight \"against war and fascism.\" They felt a close kinship with the war hero who hated wars, and hated the men who had sent him to fight th em. Now constantly proselytizing against war in the hope of stopping any new on es, Butler also wrote magazine articles condem ning Marine intervention in the affairs of China. Speaking to a Y.M.C.A. in Coat esville, Pennsylvania, in Febru- ary, he accused the big industrialis ts of America of fattening on the blood of soldiers. He pointed out that the average profit of the Du Ponts from 1910 to 1914 had been only $6 million, bu t had soared to $58 million between 1914 and 1918. Th e jump in the same periods for Bethlehem Steel had been $6 to $4 9 million; for International Nickel, $4 to $73 million. \"It makes you feel proud,\" he said bitingly. \"A lot of the stockholders are members of the Natio nal Economy League, and, after I complete my investigation, I will pr obably find they are also members of the American Liberty League.\" On February 25 Time magazine ran a two-column photo showing Butler and comedian Jimmy Durante, who attended a dinner in Pittsburgh where the general was sp eaking, facing each other \"nose to nose\" in a light moment for the photographer. The caption read \"SCHNOZZLE, GIMLET EYE. Fascist to Fascist?\" In a tiny footnote at the bottom of the page, in five-point type that could barely be read, Time informed those of its readers with 20-20 vision, \"Also last week the Ho use Committee on Un-American Activities purported to report th at a two-month investigation had convinced it that General Butler' s story of a Fascist march on Washington was alarming ly true.\" This was Time's microscopic amends for its lengthy page-one ridicule of the plot a doz en weeks earlier. In March, 1935, Butler began l ecturing to mass meetings called by the V.F.W., speaking on behalf of the Patman Bonus Bill. He lost no opportunity to warn veterans also against those big-business interests who favored war and fascism. His co nvictions were strengthened by a new book based on the Nye m unitions investigation, The Road to War, by Walter Millis.

As it went to the White House, Butler urged the President to sign it into law, pointing out that it was one way the nation could make amends to the veterans for their exploitation by big business in America's wars of the twentieth century. In a radio broadcast on May 9 he urged his liste ners to deluge Roosevelt with a million wires and letter s supporting the bill. But the President vetoed it. On May 21 Butler conferred with Senator Elmer Thomas, of Oklahoma , in Washington on tactics to get Congress to override th e veto. Afterward he declared his hope of organizing a large-scale political move ment of veterans to press for the bonus. \"My idea,\" he told the press, \"would be a mamm oth organization like the Grand Army of the Republic, which would bring political pressure to bear to take care of the soldiers.\" Now he criticized not only the American Legion but also the V.F.W. for avoiding the political arena: \"They' re no good. They've got provisions in their bylaws which say th ey can't engage in political action. The politicians put them to sleep. . . . If the soldiers don't get theirs now, they'll organize and get it. There' d be about five million of them.\" He was asked who woul d head the new organization. \"I don't know who we'd get to lead it,\" he replied. He was instantly besieged with requests from va rious veterans groups that he take them over as the nucleus for his battle for the bonus and veterans' pensions. Morris A. Bealle, pub lisher of Plain Talk magazine, wrote Butler on May 24 that he had already begun such an organization, calling it the Iron Veterans . He urged Butler to assume its leadership."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"222 The Plot to Seize the White House \"You may be interested to know that Bill Doyle tried to finance this organization for us,\" Bealle wrote, \"but acted so suspicious[ly] at Miami that I thought he was trying to take it over for the Royal Family of the American Legion, and declined to do business with him.\" This was the same Doyle who had accompanied MacGuire in the plotters' first contact with Butler. Bealle added, \"A few weeks later I discovered to my horror that he was trying to take it over for the House of Morgan.\" But Butler, made wary by the Fa scists' plan for a veterans' \"superorganization,\" began to have se cond thoughts about the wisdom of any attempt to organize a national vete rans group for political purposes. \"To attempt a national association in the beginning,\" he wrote to the organizer of the American Warriors in Iowa, \"would only lead to great financial expense and exploitation of the veterans by chiselling professionals. . . . While it might be possible to find those who would contribute the necessary funds, it woul d put the veterans under obligation to the contributors.\" His fight for the Bonus Bill, and hi s bare-knuckled attacks against the establishment, led to cancellation of hi s radio broadcasts as of July 3. A month earlier, when Van Zandt urged hi m to come to Mont ana to speak for the soldiers' bonus at a V.F.W. rally there, Butler declined. \"Such a trip would be a very heavy drain on my pocketbook,\" he explained. \"And as long as I am being put off the air for being too noisy in my criticism of this administration and fo r taking the part of the soldiers, I more or less shall have to conserve my resources.\" But he was determined to get the truth as he saw it out to the American people and undertook a new l ecture tour that would cover the country. Roosevelt had not been able to get the press to carry his message to the people, so he had turned to national radio. Butler had not been able to get national radio to carry his message, so he turned to town-hall meetings all over America. On June 12 the American League of Ex-Servicemen asked him to speak at a rally in favor of th e bonus with American Labor party Congressman Vito Marcantonio. Butler agreed, with the understanding that he spoke as an individual only, not as a"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Fallout   223    representative of any group. The Lea gue adjutant quickly agreed, adding, \"Millions of rank-and-file ve terans have always looke d to you as a champion of their cause in fighting for their rights and to receive justice from the government:\" Meanwhile a vigorous debate was ta king place in Congress, sparked by the Nye Committee revelations and the weakness of the League of Nations, over the Ludlow Resolution calling for a national referendum before war could be declared. Th e resolution failed, but on August 31 Congress passed the First Neutrality Act. It forb ade transportation of munitions to any belligerents after the President had declar ed a state of war to exist between them and authorized the President to prohibit travel by American citizens on the ships of belligerents. Butler regretted the failure of the Ludlow Resolution to pass, because he saw it as a way to prevent powe rful men from making decisions that could drag the country to war. He praised Congress for passing the Neutrality Act, however, believing that it would help take the profits out of war for American munitions-makers, a nd also make it difficult for them to embroil the United States in a fo reign war by stirring passions over Americans lost at sea in naval attacks. When a book by Senator Huey L ong appeared, hopefully called My First Days in the White House, it listed as members of Long's mythical cabinet Franklin D. Roosevelt and Herb ert Hoover, with Smedley Butler as Secretary of War. On September 15, one week after Long was assassinated, Butler was interviewed in Atlanta. He was asked how he felt about his inclusion in the late senator's proposed cabinet. Characterizing it as \"the greatest co mpliment ever paid to me,\" Butler smiled, \"I certainly felt in good company.\" Asked about his own political ambiti ons, Butler shrugged, \"I'm just a gentleman farmer now.\" Reporters then asked him to comment on the government's transfer of veterans who had been lobbying for the bonus from Washington to Florida, where some ha d been killed in a violent hurricane. \"What I'm interested in,\" Butler rep lied, \"is who approved the order to send them down there.

Although Butle r sympathized with Ethiopia, he approved of Congress's determination to keep clear of involvement in any foreign war. On Armistice Day he spoke to a crowd of ten thousand in Philadelphia at a peace rally held by the Armistice Day Celebration Committee and th e Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. Deglamorizing the first war he had fought in, the Spanish- American War, he shouted, \"That war was caused by the newspaper propaganda of William Randolph Hearst , and he's been trying to get us into another war ever since. Don't let the man you send to Washington get you into another war ... that is su rely coming along.\" Urging an even stronger neutrality law to keep America at peace, he declared: My interest in peace is personal. I have three grown sons* and I'll be damned if anybody's going to shoot them! . . . We pay the farmers in the West not to grow corn. We pay other farmers not to raise hogs . . . not to grow cotton.

The present man in the White H ouse, Mr. Roosevelt, says he will do his utmost to keep us out of war. That language isn't strong enough for us. We want him to say we won't have war! He told a Y.M.C.A. audience th at Mussolini was invading Ethiopia to get oil because th e nation was bankrupt: The only way out for Mussolini is to declare war on somebody.

None of the American men I spoke to want to no minate their sons for the Unknown Soldier of the future! Seeing the war clouds ga thering over Europe, he grew worried that Americans would once agai n be fed slogans and half -truths to distort their judgment, and fall victim s to professional propagandists for those who would urge war in support of one favored country or another. He sensed the President's growing internationalism and joined other liberal pacifists in demanding that Roosevelt stick to implementing the New Deal and steer clear of any foreign adventures. Addressing the Third U.S. Congr ess Against War and Fascism in Cleveland on January 3, 1936, he urged strict neutrality: Every indication points to a seco nd World War....

See that our Congress writes into law a command that no American soldier, sailor or Marine be used for any purpose except to protect the coastline of the United States, and protect his home-and I mean, his home-not an oil well in Iraq, a British investment in China, a sugar plantation in Cuba, a silver mine in Mexico, a glass factory in Japan, an American-owned share of stock in a European factory-in short, not an American investment anywhere except at home! . . . Let Congress say to all foreign invest ors: \"Come on home or let your money stay out of the c ountry-we will not defend it.\" As the nation grew increasingly polarized between anti-Fascist interventionists and antiwar isolati onists, Butler's uncompromising stand against war was sometimes confused with the right wing propaganda of pro-Fascists who wanted no Ameri can help given to the victims of Mussolini and Hitler. In April, 1936, the Tacoma News-Tribune published an editorial on his antiwar speeches, intimating that he was \"credited with fascist leanings.\" The Olympia, Washingt on, post of the United Spanish War Veterans immediately passed a resolution protesting this libel. Demanding a retraction, they pointed ou t, \"Less than three years ago he stifled an incipient fascist rebelli on in the eastern United States, an accomplishment due solely to hi s own prompt initiative, thereby demonstrating once more his stalwart Americanism.\" While Butler had become an isol ationist out of disillusionment"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Fallout   227    with the motives of those who had e ngineered armed U.S. intervention in other countries, he hated fascism as fervently as he hated war. He warned angrily that the Fascist fift h column in America was so active that one in every five hundred Americ ans had become \"at heart a traitor to democracy.\" One of his long-fought crusades ended in triumph in January, 1936, when Congress, under heavy pre ssure from the nation's veterans aroused by Butler, Senators Patman and Thomas, and the V.F.W. bonus rallies, finally passed the Patman Bonus Bill over Roosevelt's veto. Many veterans groups now urged hi m to throw his hat into the presidential race of 1936. A realist, he declined, explaining, \"I am too ignorant to be President of the United States and have not a definite plan for curing our present ills. I am doing the best I can to educate myself, but feel that no man should invite ot hers to follow him unless he has a definite objective, and has the cour se marked out, day by day. I, of course, learned the above from my military life.\" He devoted all his energies to keeping America out of the war he saw coming. Preoccupied with writing and speaking against it, as well as reading to learn more about it, he had no time for the theater, radio, or tennis, which he loved and played br illiantly. At the dinner table at home and elsewhere, guests listened to him spellbound in comple te silence. He was kept talking so much that he fre quently left the table without having had more than a mouthful of food. A thoroughgoing extrovert, he was not ostensibly an egotist; it simply came naturally to him as a Ma rine general to be in command of any situation. His children could not recall any gathering at which their father did not hold forth, less because he wanted or needed to, than because he was urged on by a barrage of interested questions. People were fascinated by his views and experiences. He was not, however, among the honored guests when the American Liberty League, in Janua ry, 1936, organized a banquet for two thousand of its members at the Ma yflower Hotel in Washington. The principal speaker was Al Smith."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":" 228 The Plot to Seize the White House 7 In his speech Smith warned Americans th at they faced a choice between \"the pure air of America or the foul breath of Communistic Russia.\" The New Deal, he charged, was taking the na tion into communism. The press, 8o percent anti-Roosevelt, warmly appla uded his attack. Militant C.LO. labor leader John L. Lewis growled that Sm ith had undoubtedly been \"well paid\" by his present employers for what he had said. New Deal partisans denounced Smith as a tool of Wall Street. \"I just can't understand it,\" Rooseve lt told Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins. \"All the things we have done in the Federal Government are like the things A1 Smith did as governor of Ne w York. They're the things he would have done as President. . . . What in the world is the matter?\" The American Liberty League banque t marked the opening of their hate campaign of propaganda to defeat the reelection of Roosevelt in 1936. The Scripps-Howard press and its United Press wire service, an exception to the rabidly anti-Roosevelt newspaper chains, rushed to the President's defense. Following through on Butler's expose, their papers carried a story headlined: \"Liberty League Cont rolled by Owners of $37,000,000,000.\" Directors of the League were identified as also being directors of U.S. Steel, General Motors, Standard Oil, Chas e National Bank, Goodyear Tire, and Mutual Life Insurance Company. Li beral senators joined the attack. On January 23 Senator Schwelle nbach denounced \"J. Pierpont Morgan and John J. Raskob and Pierre du Pont and all the rest of these rascals and crooks who control the Am erican Liberty League.\" Senator Robert M.

Raskob,"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Fallout   229    and declared, \"It is not an organization that can be expected to defend the liberty of the masses of the Americ an people. It speaks for the vested interests.\" The attacks on the League, plus Roos evelt's reelection in 1936 over its desperate and expensive opposition, destroyed the organization as an effective force of reaction in America. It was disbanded soon afterward with a brief announcement to the press that the purposes for which the League had been formed had been served, and that it was therefore no longer necessary. But affiliates financed by th e League, like the Sentinels of the Re- public, the Crusaders, and other pro -Fascist and far-right organizations, continued their agitation. Butler continued to stump the count ry through 1936 warning against involvement in the coming war he fore saw. He was gratified on February 29 when Congress passed the Second Neutra lity Act, amending the original act to prohibit either loans or credits to belligerent nations. He was disturbed, however, when the Spanish civil war broke out in July. The Neutrality Act imposed a boycott of aid to the Loyalist Government, while it was apparent that Mussolini and Hitler were supplying both money and military assistance to Fra nco. But by this time Butler was so passionately opposed to the loss of another American soldier on foreign soil, he felt only strict neutrality could prevent it. He shocked a meeting of the Am erican League Against War and Fascism, which was trying to raise funds for the Loyalists, by asking them, \"What the hell is it our business what's going on in Sp ain? Use common sense or you'll have our boys getting their guts blown out over there. Americans en masse never did a wr ong thing. Mind your own business. Have faith in your own country.\" He co nsidered the argument that Hitler and Mussolini had to be \"stopped now before it's too late\" the kind of sophistry that had plunged America into World Wa r I with frightening warnings about the Kaiser. In September he endorsed the ca ndidacy of Representative Vito Marcantonio, of the left-wing Ameri can Labor party, for his antiwar, anti- Fascist stand.

Butler and Senator Bone Warn Veterans of Foreign Wars of the Future Men who fought America's fore ign wars cheered violently today as a major general and a Se nator called warfare \"a business racket.\" Major Gen.

Soldiers never leave the country except to pr otect the moneyed interests.\" One enthusiastic veteran who a pplauded him afterward wrote to President Roosevelt urging Butler's ap pointment as Secretary of War to replace retiring George H.

Six days later the mood of the nation grew more apprehensive, however, as Hitle r and Mussolini signed the Rome- Berlin Axis pact and the following mo nth were joined by Japan, which signed an Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany. Roosevelt's landslide reelection st rengthened his hand against the isolationists, and there were signs th at the White House intended to take a tougher stand against the Axis powers. Butler grew increasingly worried that the President might be starting the nation down the road to war. Speaking at an Armistice Day di nner for veterans, Butler an- nounced firmly that he, with a record of thirty-three years of military service, would never again shoulder ar ms except in defense of America's own shores. 8 Attacking congressional attempts to put loopholes in the Neutrality Act, Butler warned in a subsequent speech that once the United States was lured into shipping su pplies to a belligerent,"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":" 232 The Plot to Seize the White House Americans would soon hear the old cr y-\"the American flag insulted, American property destroyed . . . same old thing over again, just as it was in the World War.\" America, he said, best served itself and the world by staying at peace: Help them to bind up the w ounds when the distressed world has fought itself to exhaustion and ha s overthrown its false and selfish leaders.

I am also firmly convinced that another universal war will make man into a savage, ready to ta ke by force what he wants, law or no law. His tone grew acrid and rese ntful when Roosevelt won con- gressional consent to amending the Neutrality Act in May, 1937, authorizing the sale to belligerents of some commodities on a cash-and- carry basis. Since a national poll show ed that 73 percent of Americans favored some kind of p opular referendum before the United States could declare war, Butler felt that the Pre sident was ignoring the will of the people and seeking to tie their fate to that of England and France. On July 12 he warned a thousan d veterans at Paterson, New Jersey, that unless the nation's ve terans banded together to demand peace, America would be at war again in a short time. He urged them to demand that U.S. armed forces be kept within their own borders and that the use of the American flag be re stricted to government-owned ships. Speaking to a Writers' Union m eeting in Philadelphia, he described how the United States mi ght be dragged into the next European war. A European ship would stop a U.S. ship carrying munitions to a potential enemy. Th e American captain would radio William Randolph Hearst that the flag had been insulted. Orators would begin demanding that Americans ave nge the insult. Ministers would discover that they were \"transmitte rs from God\" and encourage a holy crusade.

We Americans who love and protect our flag should certainly have a voice in where it is flown. With Japanese troops sweepi ng through China and seizing the coastal cities, Butler addressed th e V.F.W. convention in September urging that all American forces be withdrawn from China. Three months later Japanese airmen sank the U.S. gunboat Panay in Chinese waters. A poll showed that 53 percent of Amer icans agreed with Butler's demand for withdrawal of all United Stat es forces. But instead Washington demanded indemnity from Tokyo. Butler was convinced that a conti nued American presence in Asia could only lead to eventual war with an aggressive Japan bent on becoming the dominant power in the Or ient. He saw confirmation of his belief that war was a business racket when Washington continued to permit American corporations to se ll scrap iron and oil to Tokyo for its war machine. He also knew that th ere were over two billion dollars in American investments in Germany, which was being goaded by British diplomacy into attacking the Soviet Union. If these facts seemed to him more immediately menacing than the steadily escalating aggression of the Axis powers, he was not alone among liberal and left-wing Americans in this myopia.

He did, he replied, and hoped that Congress would fix a defense line beyond which the Navy would not be allowed to operate. \"Suppose Japan tried to inva de the United States?\" Her forces would be so weak by the time they reach ed the Pacific Coast, Butler replied, th at \"we could knock her over with a feather.\" He recommended a force of twenty-thousand-ton ba ttleships that would hug the coasts and, with the aid of submarines , aircraft, and coastal defenses, would be able to stand off any hostile forces that came within striking distance. \"I am a friend of the Navy,\" he declared, \"and I have an anchor tattooed on my chest, but if we go to building up the Navy as proposed in the bill, and loading down the peop le with the cost of it, the people will turn on the Navy as they did in the eighties, and no t a ship will be able to leave port, for there just won't be a do llar appropriated for the Navy.\" He was joined in opposing the Navy construction bill by eighteen peace organizations, including th e American Friends Service Committee, the Federal Council of Chur ches of Christ in America, the National Council of Jewish Women, the Conference on World Peace of the Methodist Episcopal Church,"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"236 The Plot to Seize the White House the National Council for the Prevention of War, the Church Peace Union, and the National Student Federation.

Like them, he approved of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's efforts to buy \"peace in our time\" at Munich. Confident that the Nazis could not ge t through the French Maginot line, he also believed that every Frenchman wo uld fight fiercely to protect his own plot of land against any invasion. The Stalin-Hitler nonaggression p act of August 23, 1939, fol-lowed by the invasion of Poland, made it clear that the world was tottering on the verge of another great war.

Not a single drop of American blood should ever again be spilled on foreign soil. Let's build up a national defense so tight that even a rat couldn't crawl through!\" Three days later Great Britain a nd France declared war on Germany. On the same day the British passenger liner Athenia was torpedoed and sunk without warning off the Hebrides, drowning thirty American passengers. That night, in a fireside radio chat to the American people, Roosevelt declared, \"This nation will remain a ne utral nation, but I cannot ask that every American remain neutral in thought as well.\" In November Congress passed a new neutrality act that legalized the sale of munitions to belligerent nations on a cash-and-carry basis. The news filled Butler with dismay. \"This country,\" he protested, \"did not have one solitary blessed thing to do with the making of this mess over there, and th ere is no possible sane and logical reason why we should feel any impulse to take a hand in it.\""},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Fallout   237    10 A spiteful rumor that Butler had become a spokesman for Father Coughlin's Christian Front led some Jewish groups to threaten cancellation of speeches he was scheduled to make to them in November. \"I couldn't believe there was a word of truth in this,\" wrote Mildred Smith, executive secretary of the Open Forum Speakers Bureau, \"but I dared not say an official `no' without direct word from you on this matter.\" He wired back indignantly, \"Hav e never spoken for the Christian Front. I am a Quaker and am preaching tolerance and am not connected nor will I have anything to do with a ny movement or organization advocating intolerance or the entrance of this country into any foreign war.\" His hatred for war did not cause any diminution in his hatred for fascism, but he refused to sanction one to fight the other except in absolute self-defense. Once he was visited by a female cousin who had married a German and brimmed over with praise fo r the Nazis. Butler's face grew taut as she babbled on, but he said nothi ng until it was time to say good-bye. Unable to contain himself any longer, he rasped at the door, \"Nellie, if Hitler comes over here, thee can be sure I will be on the beach at Atlantic City to kick the everlasting hell out of him!\" His taste in books increasingly reflected both his antiwar and his anti- Fascist convictions. In his libr ary during his last years were Sawdust Caesar, by George Seldes, The Road to War, by Walter Millis, and Johnny Got His Gun, by Dalton Trumbo. Europe Under the Terror, by John L. Spivak, was inscribed to him as \"one of the best fighters against Fascism in the country, with the respect and admiration of J.L.S.\""},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"238 The Plot to Seize the White House In 1939 he wrote an antiwar pi ece for a book ed ited by Paul Comly French, Common Sense Neutrality -Mobilizing for Peace. Sharing the covers with him we re such contributors as Eleanor Roosevelt, Charles A. Beard, Dr. Harry Elmer Barnes, Senator William Borah, Norman Thomas, Sumner Welles, He rbert Hoover, Senator Robert La Follette, Jr., John L. Lewis, and Elliot Roosevelt. But as the Nazis swept through Belgium and the Netherlands on May 10, 1940, bypassing the Magino t line and imperiling France, millions of Americans grew alarme d. A Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies wa s organized by William A llen White to rout the isolationists. In a mood of black despair Butler deliver ed his last antiwar speech on May 24 at Temple Univers ity. Hating Hitler and Nazism, he nevertheless could not shake off the dr ead specter of on e or two million dead American you ths strewn over Europe's battlefields. He decried fears of a German invasi on of the United States as alarmist, playing into the hands of war profiteers. From the comfortable vantage of hindsight, it is easy to fault Smedley Butler as having been woefully shortsighted in his stubborn view that the best intere sts of Americans were se rved by persisting in a policy of neutrality. But thirty years in uniform, seeing active service in every war and campaign since th e Spanish-American War, had convinced him that war was nothing but a cruel and bloody swindle of the people. His suspicions were not eased by observing in dustrialists and bankers entering trade cartels wi th America's potential enemies, Germany, Italy, and Japan, while U. S. arms manufacturers made huge profits selling munitions to both sides and pressed Congress to spend new billions on \"defense\" to keep up wi th the \"arms race\" they themselves had promoted. In his disillusionment he saw li ttle difference between World War I and World War II. Ever since he had been a starry-eyed Marine recruit of sixteen, Ameri can administrations had persistently cried wolf in order to use him and the youths under him in order to protect and augment foreign investments wrapped in the flag. It was now impossible for him to believe that the"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Fallout   239    shouts of wolf he heard once more any more genuine than all those he had heard at regular intervals since 1898. Worn out by his strenu ous speaking tours, di scouraged as he saw the United States slipping step by step into anot her bloodbath, be fell ill with exhaustion. His doctor ordered hi m to enter the Naval Hospital in Philadelphia for a rest and examination. \"As soon as I get out,\" he promis ed Ethel Bitter, \"I am going to take thee to Europe fo r the vacation I've never managed to find time for. Thee deserves it for thy patience!\" During his four weeks in the hospital, however, lie lost weight rapidly and guessed that his ailment was more se rious than the doctors were letting him know. On June 10 Italy declared war on Britain and France. Roosevelt promptly called for \"full speed ahea d\" in the promotion of national defense and for the extension of mate rial aid to \"oppon ents of' force.\" The next day Congress voted anot her $3.2 billion in military appropriations. On June 14 Butler's gloom plun ged to new depths when Germany invaded France unopposed. Four days later Admiral Harold R. Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, asked Co ngress for a two-ocean navy in a $4-billion expansion program. During a visit by his son Smedley, Jr., Butler reflected glumly on the futility of his long fight to k eep his country from getting involved in another war. \"I think, \" he said ruefully, \"tha t I should have stayed with my own kind.\" He meant Quak ers and Marines, rather than politicians. On June 21, 1940, hours befo re France was scheduled to surrender officially to Adolf Hitler, Smedley Darlington Butler died in the hospital of an abdominal a ilment suspected to be cancer."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"240 The Plot to Seize the White House 11 Although the paths of President Roosev elt and Smedley Bu tler had diverged sharply over the questions of war and peace, the President sent a wire to Ethel Butler: \"I grieve to hear of Sm edley's passing. I shall always remember the old days in Haiti. My heart goes out to you and the family in this great sorrow.\" Among others who sent condolences were former Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, then ambassa dor to Mexico, and Major General Thomas Holcomb, commandant of the Marine Corps. A simple funeral service was held at the Butler home in Newtown Square, followed by burial in West Chester, with attendance li mited to close friends and immediate members of the family. Ethel Butler kne w that elaborate formal ceremonies would be a violation of the principl es of her husband, who had always detested phony pomp and circumstance. The general who could ha ve had all the wealth and power he wanted as dictator of the United States died leaving an estate that totaled two thousand dollars. The New York Times now hailed him as \"one of the most glamorous and gallant men who ever wore the uni form of the United States Marine Corps.... a brave man and an able lead er of troops.... He laughed at danger, and he set an example to his men that he lped them to carry out the traditions of the Marine Corps.\" Calling him also \"often a st orm center,\" the Times added, \"It was when he ventured into public affairs that his impetuosity led him into trouble.\" In an editorial obituary on June 23 the New York Herald Tribune had no cautious reservations: It is as a great \"leatherneck\" that Gen.

He came of Quaker ancestry, but no Quaker more dearly love d to be belligerent. . . . Because he was utterly unafraid, brave and unselfish, he earned the characterization of being the ideal Amer ican soldier, and, to use the words of an official citation of the Navy De partment, of being \"one of the most brilliant officers in the United States.\" Thirty years later Tom Dick Bu tler told me wistfully, \"Dad's experiences were an important part of our lives. He was always `where it was at.' We miss him tremendously.\" When the war that Smedley Butler had dreaded and sought to prevent came to his country out of the clouds over Pearl Harbor, eighteen months after his death, an Americ an destroyer was named the U.S.S. Butler in his honor. Converted to a high-speed mine sweeper, it saw distinguished service during the war. That would not have seemed inappr opriate to the fighting hero who hated war as a racket, yet who had once declared, \"I am a peace-loving Quaker, but when war breaks out every damn man in my family goes.\" Both his sons entered the service, Smedley, Jr. in the Marines, Tom Dick in the Navy. A hell-for-leather Marine officer w ho drove himself as hard as his men, he had won their enthusiastic ad miration and loyalty. He, in turn, had been passionately and stubb ornly devoted to them, in service and out of it. Former Marine Commandant David M. Shoup, who served under Butler in China, told me that he and all the men in the command had respected Butler as \"one helluva fine soldier.\" During World War II Butler's old ne wspaper friend, E. Z. Dimitman, interviewed Douglas MacArthur in th e Pacific as a war correspondent. Noting a resemblance between MacArthur 's commander of the 32d Division, General Robert L. Eichelberger, and Old Gimlet Eye, Dimitman mentioned it to MacArthur and suggested that Eich elberger might prove another Butler. \"Never in a million years,\" MacArthur replied emphatically. \"There's only one Butler. He was one of the really great generals in American history.\""},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" 242 The Plot to Seize the White House 12 Although Butler may have been the first high-ranking Marine Corps general to challenge es tablishment policies, he was not the last. Significantly, as early as January, 1966, another distinguished Marine general, former Commanda nt David M. Shoup, went before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to wa rn the American people that President Lyndon B. Johnson's escala tion of the war in Vietnam was a tragic mistake. It might also be noted that befo re the explosion of the Pentagon Papers, two Marine Corps colone ls wrote books denouncing the intervention in Vietnam as genocide against a people caught up in a civil war, in support of a corrupt Saigon dictatorship. Perhaps the elite fighting team of the United States produces high-ranking dissenters like Butler, Shoup, and the two colonels because many men who choose careers as Marine Corps officers tend to be strongly motivated by patriotism and idealis m. When there is an American military intervention overse as, it is usually the Marines who spearhead it, do the fi ghting, get an accurate picture of the real situation, and observe who is being politically supported or suppressed, and why. All too often these officers have been disillusioned by the use of the Marines to suppress so cial change in small co untries, on behalf of dictators, an elite military an d business class, and American commercial interests. This realizat ion outrages their idealism. They resent the expenditure of the lives of Marines under them for sordid motives in power games of dollar diplomacy and international politics. Hence the most intelligent and high-principled Marine staff officers may become the bitterest critics of Am erican administrations that misuse the Corps. The war records, motivation, and"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Fallout   242    integrity of such generals as Bu tler and Shoup make it impossible to dismiss their testimony expressing dismay at the way United States expeditionary forces have been de ployed in the name of national defense. Although Butler had considered hi mself basically a pacifist who hated war, he had placed duty to his country above all other considerations and had sp ent thirty-three years of his life carrying out orders to defend it. His gradual disi llusionment with those orders, and the men who gave them, had led him to speak out abrasi vely against the use of the military on behalf of American vested interests. No matter whose corns he trod on, or the cost to his career, he had habitually said and did what he thought right. His bluntness had made him unpopular with some Presi dents, Secretaries of State and Navy, and the highest-ranking genera ls and admirals in Washington, who considered him a m ilitary firebrand as irre pressible as Generals Billy Mitchell and George S. Patton. But it was just this quality in Butler that had gi ven him the courage and in tegrity to face public ridicule to expose, in the name of se rvice to his countr y, what John L. Spivak called \"one of the most fant astic plots in American history.\" \"What was behind the plot was shrouded in a silence which has not been broken to this day,\" Spivak wrote. \"Even a generation later, those who are still alive and know a ll the facts have ke pt their silence so well that the conspiracy is not even a footnote in American histories. It would be regrettable if historians neglected this ep isode and future generations of Americans never heard of it.\" In 1964 Speaker of th e House John W. McCormack referred to the plot in his speech before the Democratic convention in Atlantic City, when he warned against right-wing extr emists in the Barry Goldwater camp. But he did not give any details, and only a knowledgeable handful of Americans understood the full implications of what he was talking about.
