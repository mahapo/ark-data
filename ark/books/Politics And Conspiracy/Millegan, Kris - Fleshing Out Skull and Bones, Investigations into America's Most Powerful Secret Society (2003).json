When I was first writing on the subject, I cont acted several publishers and was po- litely told, by the one that answered, they \"didn't want to take on Skull & Bones.\" An article of mine was published online at www.para scope.com, which was well re- ceived. From that article and a friendship with Ant ony Sutton — came this book. The Internet has become an astounding force whose c ultural and political realities are still to be understood and it's power is forcin g change that continues today—with an unknown ending. The Internet has allowed uncenso red national discussion, en- gendered understandings and energized a potent pleb eian power whose creativity is countering the secretive sophism that ruins our rep ublic and economy through covert corrupt means. The question remains: will the dream scape that enthralls vast numbers continue its hoodwink, and will our children wake u p slaves in a mean, technologi- cally locked-down fascist state, or will they conti nue to slumber in the propaganda and hidden corruption of the celebrity-laden delusi on of the contrived virtual reality friendly fascism that the secret societies have cre ated around us — or will the Internet and other factors bring about a revival of our civi c heritage and liberty. The most important thing that I would like folks to understand from this work is that the secrecy of these organizations is not g ood for our Republic. These secret societies are historically foreign-based and do not care about this country. Their ends justifies the means Zeitgeist leads to massive corr uption and the \"institutionalized sociological\" excess of \"elite deviancy.\" Where a c ertain few believe that they are beyond the law and then through corrupted political and economic power — act above the law, through whatever means at their disp osal. One question this book examines is whether there is any truth in the age-o ld lore of the conspiracy theory of history — are we are dealing with a multi-generatio nal, necromantic, synarchistic phenomenon? Have secret societies created a nationa l security state apparatus to beguile us hoi polloi of our economic, civic and sp iritual integrity? Do these secret societies create and play both sides in controlled conflicts to produce outcomes to further their New World Order millenniumist designs ? Porch brethren are requirement for a secret society to work and many in these organizations, magickal and fraternal are unawares of any deeper motivations of the elite leadership of the group. It is when these sec ret organizations with members in high political office exert their influence towards goals unknown and/or unbecoming that we citizens should take notice — and action. Mysticism and fellowship are not bad and evil thing s. They are just like any thing. It is what people do with them ... their actions th at do ill or good in this world. Secrecy and our Republic do not mix. Our children's future is what we leave them.

Elihu Yale was born near Boston, educated in London , and served with the British East India Company, eventua lly becom- ing governor of Fort Saint George, Madras, India in 1687. He amassed a great fortune from trade and returned to England in 1699. Yale became known as a philanthropist; upon r eceiving a request from the Collegiate School in Connecticut , he sent a donation and a gift of books. After subsequent bequ ests, Cotton Mather suggested the school be named Yale College i n 1718. A statue of Nathan Hale stands on Old Campus at Yal e University. A copy of that statue stands in front of the CIA's headqua rters in Langley, Virginia. Yet another stands in front of Phillips Academy in Ando ver, Massachusetts (where George H.W. Bush went to prep school and joined his first secret society at the age of 12). Nathan Hale, along with three other Yale graduates, was a member of the \"Culper Ring,\" one of America's fir st intel- ligence operations. Established by George Washingto n, it was successful throughout the Revolutionary War. Nathan was the only operative to be ferreted out by the Britis h, and after speaking his famous regrets, he was hanged in 1776. Ever since the founding of the Republic, the relationshi p between Yale and the Intelligence Community has been unique . 1 THE STORY BEGINS AT YALE, where three threads of Am erican social history — espionage, drug smuggling and secr et societies "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY In 1823, Samuel Russell established Russell and Company for the purpose of acquiring opium in Tur- key and smuggling it to China. Russell and Company merged with the Perkins (Boston) syndicate in 1830 and became the primary American opium smuggler. Many of the great American and European fortunes were built on the \"China\" (opium) trade. One of Russell and Company's Chief of Operations in Canton was Warren Delano, Jr., grandfather of Fr ank- lin D. Roosevelt. Other Russell partners included J ohn Cleve Green (who financed Princeton), Abiel Low (wh o financed construction of Columbia), Joseph Coolidge and the Perkins, Stur gis and Forbes families. (Coolidge's son organized the United Fruit company, and his grandson, Archibald C. Coolidge, was a co-founder of the Council on For eign Relations.) William Huntington Russell (S&B 1833), Samuel's cousin, studied in Germany from 1831-32. Germany wa s a hotbed of new ideas. The \"scientific method\" was being applied to all forms of human endeavor. Prussia, wh ich blamed the defeat of its forces by Napoleon in 1806 on soldiers only thinking about themselves in the stre ss of battle, took the principles set forth by John Locke and Jean Rousseau and created a new educational system. Johan Wolfgang Fitche, in his \"Address to the Germa n People,\" declared that the children would be taken over by the State and told what to think and how to think it. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel took over Fitche's ch air at the University Of Berlin in 1817 and was a professor there until his death in 1831. Hegel was the culmination of the German idealistic philosophy sch ool of Immanuel Kant. To Hegel, our world is a world of reason. The state is Absolute Reason and the citizen can only become free by worship and obedien ce to the state. Hegel called the state the \"march of God in the world\" and the \"final end.\" This final end, Heg el said, \"has supreme right against the individual, whose su preme duty is to be a member of the state.\" Both fascism and communism have their philosophical roots in Hegelia n- ism. Hegelian philosophy was very much in vogue dur ing William Russell's time in Germany. When Russell returned to Yale in 1832, he formed a senior society with Al- phonso Taft (S&B 1833). According to information ac quired from a break-in to the \"tomb\" (the Skull and Bones meeting hall) in 18 76, \"Bones is a chapter of a corps in a German University ... General Russell, i ts founder, was in Germany before his Senior Year and formed a warm friendship with a leading member of a German society.

Ru ssell, along with 14 others, became the founding members of \"The Order of Scull and Bones,\" later changed to \"The Order of Skull and Bones.\" The secretive Order of Skull and Bones exists only at Yale. Fifteen juniors are \"tapped\" each yea r by the seniors to be initiated into next year's gro up. Some say each initiate is given $ 15,000 and a gran d- father clock. Far from being a campus fun-house, the group is geared more toward the success of its members in the post-collegiate world. The family names on the Skull and Bones roster roll off the tongue like an elite party list — Lord, Whitney, Taft, Jay, Bundy, Harriman, Weyerhaeuser, Pinchot, Rockefeller, Goodyear, Sloane, Stimson, Ph elps, Perkins, Pillsbury, Kellogg, Vanderbilt, Bush, Lovett and ot hers. William Russell went on to become a general and a s tate legislator in Connecticut. Alphonso Taft was appoin ted US Attorney General, Secretary of War (a post many \"Bo nes- men\" have held), Ambassador to Austria, and Ambassador to Russia (another post held by many \"Bonesmen\"). His son, Wil- liam Howard Taft (S&B 1878), is the only man to be both President of the United States and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. S ECRETS OF THE \"T OMB \" HE ORDER FLOURISHED from the very beginning in spit e of occasional squalls of controversy. There was dissension from s ome professors, who objected to its secrecy and exclusiveness. And ther e was backlash from students, showing concern about the influence \"Bones\" was hav ing over Yale finances and the favoritism shown to \"Bonesmen.\" In October, 1873, Volume 1, Number 1, of The Iconoc last was published in New Haven. It was only published once and was on e of only a few openly published articles on the Order of Skull and Bones. 3 T From The Iconoclast.

The reason i s found in a remark made by one of Yale's and America's first men: 'Few will gi ve but Bones men and they care far more for their society than they do for th e college ....' Year by year the deadly evil is growing. The societ y was never as obnoxious to the college as it is today, and it is just this ill-feeling that shuts the pockets of non-members. Never before has it shown such arrogan ce and self-fancied superior- ity. It grasps the College Press and endeavors to r ule it all. It does not deign to show its credentials, but clutches at power with th e silence of conscious guilt. To tell the good which Yale College has done would be well nigh impossible. To tell the good she might do would be yet more dif ficult. The question, then, is reduced to this - on the one hand lies a source of incalculable good - on the other a society guilty of serious and far-reaching crimes . It is Yale College against Skull and Bones!! We ask all men, as a question of right, whi ch should be allowed to live? At first, the society held its meetings in hired ha lls. Then in 1856, the \"Tomb,\" a windowless, brown-stone meeting hall, was constru cted, where to this day the \"Bonesmen\" hold their \"strange, occultish\" initiati on rites and meet each Thurs- day and Sunday. On September 29,1876, a group calling itself The Order of File and Claw broke into the Skull and Bones' holy of holies. In the \"tomb\" they found lodge-room 324 \"fitted up in black velvet, even the walls being covered with the mate- rial.\" Upstairs was lodge-room 322, \"the sanc- tum sanctorum of the temple ... furnished in red velvet\" with a pen- tagram on the wall. In the hall are \"pictures of the founders of Bones at Yale, and of members of the Society in Germany, when the chapter was est ablished here in 1832.\" The raiding party found another interesting scene in th e parlor next to room 322. From The Fall Of Skull And Bones: On the west wall, hung among other pictures, an old engraving representing an open burial vault, in which, on a stone slab, re st four human skulls, grouped about a fools cap and bells, an open book, several mathematical instruments, a beggar's scrip, and a royal crown. On the arched wall above the vault are the explanatory words, in Roman letters, 'We War Der Th or, Wer Weiser, Wer Bet- tier Oder, Kaiser?' and below the vault is engraved , in German characters, the sentence; 'Ob Arm, Ob Beich, im Tode gleich.' 4"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"E VERYTHING Y OU W ANTED TO A SK , B UT W ERE A FRAID TO K NOW The picture is accompanied by a card on which is wr itten, 'From the German Chapter. Presented by D. C. Gilman of D. 50'. Daniel Coit Gilman (1852), along with two other \"Bo nesmen,\" formed a troika which still influences American life today. Soon af ter their initiation in Skull and Bones, Daniel Gilman, Timothy Dwight (1849) and And rew Dickinson White (1853) went to study philosophy in Europe at the Un iversity of Berlin. Gilman returned from Europe and incorporated Skull and Bon es as the Russell Trust in 1856, with himself as Treasurer and William H. Russ ell as President. He spent the next 14 years in New Haven consolidating the or der's power. Gilman was appointed Librarian at Yale in 1858. Thr ough shrewd political maneuvering, he acquired funding for Yale's science departments (Sheffield Scientific School) and was able to get t he Morrill Land Bill introduced in Congress, passed and finally sig ned by Presi- dent Lincoln, after being vetoed by President Bucha nan. This bill, \"donating public-lands for State College for agriculture and sciences,\" is now known as the Land Grant College Act. Yale was the first school in America t o get the federal land scrip and quickly grabbed all of Conne cticut's share at the time. Pleased by the acquisitions, Yal e made Gil- man a Professor of Physical Geography. Daniel was the first President of the University of California.

His buddy, Andrew D.

White was also Chairman of the American delegation to the first Hague Conference in 1899, which establish ed an international judiciary. Timothy Dwight, a professor at Yale Divinity School , was installed as president of Yale in 1886. All preside nts since have been either \"Bonesmen\" or directly tied to the Order and its interests. The Daniel/Gilman/White trio was also responsible for the founding of the American E conomic Association, the American Chemical Society and the Ameri- can Psychological Association. Through their influ ences on John Dewey and Horace Mann, this trio continues to have an enormous impact on education today. N ETWORKS OF P OWER I N HIS BOOK A MERICA ' S S ECRET E STABLISHMENT , Antony Sutton outlined the Order of Skull and Bones' ability to establish vert ical and horizontal \"chains of influence\" that ensured the continuity of their conspiratorial schemes. The Whitney-Stimson-Bundy links represent the \"vert ical chain.\" W. C. Whitney (S&B 1863), who married Flora Payne ( of the Standard Oil/ Payne dynasty), was Secretary of the Navy. His atto rney was a man named Elihu Root. Root hired Henry Stimson (S&B 1888), out of l aw school. Stimson took over from Root as Secretary of War in 1911, appointed by fellow Bonesman William Howard Taft. Stimson later became Coolidge's Govern or-General of the Philippine Islands, Hoover's Secretary of State, and Secretary of War during the Roosevelt and Truman Administrations. Hollister Bundy (S&B '09) was Stimson's special ass istant and point man in the Pentagon for the Manhattan Pro ject. His two sons, also members of Skull and Bones, were William Bundy (S&B '39) and McGeorge Bundy (S&B '40) — both very active in governmental and foundation affairs. The two brothers, from their positions in the CIA, the Department of Defense and the State Department, and as Special Assistants to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, exercised significant impact on the flow of information and intelligence during the Vietnam \"War.\" 6 "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"E VERYTHING Y OU W ANTED TO A SK , B UT W ERE A FRAID TO K NOW William Bundy went on to be editor of Foreign Affai rs, the influential quarterly of the Council on Foreign Affairs (CFR). McGeorge b ecame president of the Ford Foundation. Another interesting group of \"Bonesmen\" is the Harriman/ Bush crowd. Averell Harriman (S&B '13), \"El- der Statesman\" of the Democratic Party, and his brother Roland Harriman (S&B '17) were very active members. In fact, four of Roland's fellow \"Bonesmen\" from the class of 1917 were directors of Brown Brothers, Harriman, including Prescott Bush (S&B '17), George HW Bush's dad. Since the turn of the century, two investment bank firms — Guaranty Trust and Brown Brothers, Harriman — were both dominated by members of Skull and Bones. These two firms were heavily involved in the financing of Commu- nism and Hitler's regime. Bonesman share an affinity for the Hegelian ideas o f the historical dialectic, which dictates the use of controlled conflict (thes is versus anti-thesis) to create a pre-determined synthesis. This being a synthesis of their making and design, where the state is absolute and individuals are gra nted their freedoms based on their obedience to the state — a New World Order. Funding and political maneuvering on the part of \"B onesmen\" and their al- lies helped the Bolsheviks prevail in Russia. In de fiance of federal laws, the cabal financed industries, established banks and developed oil and mineral deposits in the fledgling USSR. Later, Averell Harriman, as minister to Great Britain in charge of Lend-Lease for Britain and Russia, was responsible for shipping entire factories into Russia. According to some researchers, Harriman also oversaw the transfer of nuclear secrets, pluto nium and US dollar printing plates to the USSR. In 1932, the Union Banking Corporation of New York City was established with four directors from the 1917 S&B cell and two Nazi bankers associated with Fritz Thyssen, who had been financing Hitler s ince 1923. From George Bush; The Unauthorized Biography. President Franklin Roosevelt's Alien Property Custo dian, Leo T. Crowley, signed Vesting Order Number 248 [11/17/42] seizing the pro perty of Prescott Bush under the Trading with Enemy Act. The order, published in obscure government record books and kept out of the news,* explained nothing about the Nazis involved; only that the Union Banking Corporation was run for the Thyssen family of Germany and/or Hungary — nationals ... of a designa ted enemy country. 7 "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY By deciding that Prescott Bush and the other direct ors of the Union Banking Corporation were legally front men for the Nazis, t he government avoided the more important historical issue: In what way were H itler's Nazis themselves hired, armed, and instructed by the New York and London cl ique of which Prescott Bush was an executive manager? *New York Times, December 16, 1944, ran a five-para - graph page 25 article on actions of the New York St ate Banking Department. Only the last sentence refers t o the Nazi bank, as follows: The Union Banking Corporatio n, 39 Broadway, New York, has received authority to ch ange its principal place of business to 120 Broadway.

After the war, Prescott went on to become a US Sena tor from Connecticut and favorite golfing partner of President Eisenhower.

Many in the OSS were \"Bonesmen\" or belonged to the other Yale senior societies. Robert Lovett (S&B '18), Harriman's childhood frien d, had been tapped into Skull & Bones by Prescott Bush's cell of '17 and was a dire ctor at Brown Brothers, Harriman. Again, from George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography . On October 22, 1945, Secretary of War Robert Patter son created the Lovett Committee, chaired by Robert A. Lovett, to advise t he government on the post- World War II organization of U.S. intelligence acti vities... The new agency would 'consult' with the armed forces, but it must be the sole collecting agency in the field of foreign espionage and counterespionage . The new agency should have an independent budget, and its a ppropria- tions should be granted by Congress without public hearings. Lovett appeared before the Secretaries of State, Wa r, and Navy on November 14, 1945 ... Lovett pressed for a virtu al resump- tion of the wartime Office of Strategic Services (O SS) ...

Well, among other things, China is one of the largest producers and users of opiates in the world. For a period, in the 1800s, the Yankee Clippers in Connecticut and Massachu- setts were the fastest ships on the ocean. Speed wa s crucial to the opium trade; whoever made the trip from Turkey/India to Macao/Ho ng Kong/Shanghai first got the most for their goods. During the Opium Wars, the U.S. chose to stand on t he sidelines and cheer for the English and French, knowing that treaty obl igations would bring the U.S. a share in the spoils. Russell and Company was at times the only trading house operat- ing in Canton and used the opportunity to developed strong commercial ties and handsome profits.

In 1843, when the Port of Shanghai was opened, Russell and Co. was on e of its earliest traders. In 1903, Yale Divinity School set up a program of schools and hospitals in China. Mao Zedong was among the staff. During the intrigues of China in the 1930s and '40s, American intelligence called upon the resources of \"Yale in China,\" and George Bush's cousin and fellow \"Bonesman\" Reuben H olden. After stints as UN Ambassador and Chairman of the R epublican National Committee for the beleaguered Richard Nixon, George Bush was sent to look after the \"China trade.\" The Bush family is still very mu ch involved in the economic activities of \"Red\" China. Many researchers contend that George Bush has been with the CIA since the early 1950s, and that one of his jobs was to consolidate and co-ordinate the worldwide na rcotics industry, the largest industry on Earth.

This unit \"had tape-recordings of plans to assassinate Kennedy\" from a tap on the phone of J. Edgar Hoover. The people on the tapes were \"[Nelson] Rockefeller, Allen Dulles, [Lyndon] Johnson of Texas, George Bush and J. Edgar Hoover.\" Could George Bush be involved in the JFK assassinat ion? In 1963, Bush was living in Houston, busily carryin g out his duties as presi- dent of the Zapata Offshore oil company. He denied the existence of a note sent by the FBI's J. Edgar Hoover to \"Mr. George Bush of the CIA.\" When news of the note surfaced, the CIA first said they never commented on employment questions, but later relented, said yes, a \"George Bush\" was mentioned in the note, but that it was \"another\" George Bush, not th e man who took office in the White House in 1988. Some intrepid reporters tracked down the \"other\" Ge orge Bush and discovered that he was just a lowly clerk who had shuffled pap ers for the CIA for about six months. He never received any interagency messages from anybody at the FBI, let alone J. Edgar. It is also worth noting that a CIA code word for Ba y of Pigs was Operation Zapata, and that two of the support vessels were na med Barbara and Houston. Many say that George Bush was high up on the CIA la dder at the time, running proprietorial vehicles and placed in a position of command, responsible for many of the Cubans recruited into \"service\" at the time. All through the Iran-Contra affair, Felix Rodriguez, the man who captured and h ad Che Guevara killed for the CIA, always seemed to call Bush's office first. From The Realist (Summer, 1991): Bush was working with the now-famous CIA agent, Fel ix Rodriguez, recruit- ing right-wing Cuban exiles for the invasion of Cub a. It was Bush's CIA job to organize the Cuban community in Miami for the invas ion.... A newly discovered FBI document reveals that George Bush was directly involved in the 1963 murder of President John Kennedy. The document places mark smen by the CIA. Bush at that time lived in Texas. Hopping from Houston to M iami weekly, Bush spent 1960 and '61 recruiting Cubans in Miami for the inv asion .... George Bush claims he never worked for the CIA unti l he was appointed Director by former Warren Commission director and t hen President Jerry Ford in 1976. Logic suggests that is highly unlikely. Of course, Bush has a company duty to deny being in the CIA. The CIA is a secret organization. No one ever admits to being a member.

On the Watergate tapes, June 23, 1972, referred to in the media as the smoking gun conversation, Nixon and his Chief of Staff, H.R . Haldeman, were discuss- ing how to stop the FBI investigation into the Wate rgate burglary. They were worried that the investigation would expose their c onnection to the Bay of Pigs thing. Haldeman, in his book The Ends of Power, rev eals that Nixon always used code words when talking about the 1963 murder of JF K. Haldeman said Nixon would always refer to the assassination as the Bay of Pigs. On that transcript we find Nixon discussing the rol e of George Bush's partner, Robert Mosbacher, as one of the Texas fundraisers for Nixon. On the tapes Nixon keeps referring to the Cubans and the Tex- ans. The Texans were Bush, Mosbacher and Baker. This is another direct link be- tween Bush and evidence linking Nixon and Bush to the Kennedy assassination. M OTIVES FOR THE C ONSPIRACY O, WHY WOULD an intelligence agency/secret society want to smuggle drugs and assassinate JFK? Well, they make a lot of money and they garner inte lligence assets through their participation. There is also the rationale th at the world is a seamy and un- seemly place, and if you're going to be the big boy on the block, you better know what's going on. And what better way of knowing tha n by running it yourself? There are also some who theorize that the covert drug trade fits with plans to destabi- lize American families and society. Through demoralizing and fracturing the body politic, they can impose their will using psychologi- cal warfare and the political alchemy of the Hegelian dialectic. James Shelby Downard's article, Sorcery, Sex, Assas sination and the Science of Symbolism, an underground classic, links American h istorical events with a wild, numerological, grand occult plan \"to turn us into c ybernetic mystery zombies.\" The assassination of JFK, this article contends, wa s the performance of a public occult ritual called The Killing of the King, desig ned as a mass-trauma, mind- control assault against our US national body-politi c. During Operation Sunrise, Operation Blowback, Opera tion Paperclip and others, thousands of Nazi scientists, researchers a nd administrators were brought to the United States after World War II.

Mr. Downward feels that the perpetrators purposeful ly murdered JFK in such a way as to affect our national identity and c ohesiveness — to frac- ture America's soul. Even the blatancy of their conspiracy was designed to show their superiority and our futility. There have been studies that show a correlation between the JFK assassination and the rise in violence in society, distrust of government and other ex- tensions of social ills. T HE I LLUMINATI ; S UBVERTING THE B ODY P OLITIC HY THIS ATTACK against our body politic? In 1785, a courier died en route to Paris from Frankfort-on-the-Main. A tract written by Adam Weishaupt, founder of the Illuminati, Original Shif t in Days of Illuminations, was recovered from the dead mes- senger, containing the secret society's long-range plan for 'The New World Order through world revolution.\" The Bavarian Government outlawed the society and in 1787 published the details of The Illuminati conspi racy in The Original Writings of the Order and Sect of the Illuminati. In Adam Weishaupt's own words: By this plan, we shall direct all mankind in this m anner. And, by the simplest means, we shall set all in motion and in flames. Th e occupations must be so al- lotted and contrived that we may, in secret, influe nce all political transactions. There is disagreement among scholars as to whether or not the Illuminati survived its banishment. Nevertheless, the group had been qu ite successful in attracting members and had allied itself with the extensive Ma sonic networks. The Illuminati was publicly founded May 1,1776, at the University of Ingolstadt by Weishaupt, Professor of Canon Law. It was a very \"learned\" society; Weishaupt drew the earliest members of his new order from amo ng his students. On December 5,1776, students at William and Mary Co llege founded a secret society, Phi Beta Kappa. A second chapter was forme d, at Yale, in 1780. The anti-Masonic movement in the United States during t he 1820s held groups such as Phi Beta Kappa in a bad light. Because of pressu re, the society went public. 15 W"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY This is noted by some researchers as the direct cau se of the appearance of Yale's Order of Skull and Bones.

The line then continues to Skull and Bones in 1832, and on through the other \"only at Yale\" senior societie s, Scroll & Key and Wolf's Head. Phi Beta Kappa is the \"first three Greek letters, f or 'Philosophia Biou Kuber- netes' or 'Love of wisdom, the helmsman of life'.\" A skull homophone is scull, a quick, gliding boat and part of Skull & Bones first nomenclature. John Robison, a professor of natural philosophy at Edinburgh University in Scotland and a member of a Freemason Lodge, said th at he was asked to join the Illuminati. After study, he concluded the purpo ses of the Illuminati were not for him. In 1798, he published a book called Proofs Of A Con spiracy: An association has been formed for the express purp ose of rooting out all the religious establishments and overturning all th e existing governments... the leaders would rule the World with uncontrollable po wer, while all the rest would be employed as tools of the ambition of their unkno wn superiors. Proofs Of A Conspiracy was sent to George Washington. Responding to the sender of the book with a letter, the president said he was aware the Illuminati were in America. He felt that the Illuminati had diabolical tenets and that their object was a separation of the People from their government. In Proofs Of A Conspiracy, Robison de- scribed the ceremony of initiation of the \"Regent degree\" in Illuminism. In it \"a skeleton is pointed out to him [the initiate], at the feet of which are laid a crown and a sword. He is asked whether that is the skeleton of a king, nobleman or a beggar. As he cannot decide, the president of the meeting says to him, The character of being a man is the only one that is importance.\" 16 "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"E VERYTHING Y OU W ANTED TO A SK , B UT W ERE A FRAID TO K NOW This is, essentially, the same as the writing in th e Skull & Bones' Temple: \"Wer war der Thor, wer Weiser, Bettler oder Kaiser?

When a secret society conspires against the soverei gnly of a king, they need to organize, raise funds, make their plans operatio nal, and hopefully bring them to fruition.

A central focus of the Harriman security regime in Washington (1950-53) was the organization of covert operations and psychological warfare.

The Richard son Foundation helped to fi- nance the testing of psychotropic drugs, including LSD, at Bridgewater Hospital in Massachusetts, the center of some of the most bruta l MK-ULTRA experiments. During the Iran-Contra operations, the H.

These are totally secret, not to be released and ma ny believe will never be released. George Sr. was in charge of Iran-Contra. How do we know this? Simply because 10 or so of the official participants (from DEA, CIA, NSA and on and on) had second thoughts, s aw the illegalities, rebelled and placed their participation and what they knew o n paper and the Internet.

Butler's book Across the Busy Years — Recollections and Reflections, Scribners, 1935, pp 160-161 reveals much regarding Butler's ro le as Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy, Columbia University, in changing Ame rican education from its traditional academic orientation to a behaviorist ( Wundtian/Pavlovian) orienta- tion originating in Leipzig, Germany. This change w as necessary for brainwashing (value change) and implementation of the present wo rk force training required for a planned economy. It was Butler's access to Daniel Coit Gilman, an incorporator of Skull & Bones, and a key activist in the revolut ion of education which, resulted in bringing to Columbia University, Professor James McKeen Cattell. Butler's information ties in well with Tony Sutton's coverag e of The Order's influence on American education. Sutton's book America's Secret Establishment is the only book on The Order which documents The Order's extraordin ary influence in bringing about what this author refers to as \"the deliberate dumbing down of America.\" Butler's book also refers extensively to the activi ties of Charles D. Hilles, Sr. (not a member of The Order) whose role in the Repub lican Party included run- ning for Governor of New York, Vice President of th e United States, and who was Chairman of the Republican Party Platform Commi ttee, 1916. Charles D. Hilles, Sr. was the father of Charles D. Hilles, Jr ., one of my father's closest Bones' associates who stands behind the table in the Tomb (See photo of 1924 members of The Order. A few Bonesmen about whom I have writ ten are seated as follows: my father, Clifton Thomson, is to the left of the t able, Hilles behind table, Spof- ford standing left of the clock, and Blair standing , third from the left.) What all of this has to do with Bones is not clear, but there surely must be connections. No doubt Grandpa's receiving the Schoo l of Mines medal was well- earned. However, it is also likely that Butler, an internationalist with connections all over the English-speaking world, selected Grand pa for the honor not only due to his engineering abilities, but also due to his c onnections through his member- ship in The Order. Grandpa had good credentials for being tapped for T he Order. He was a Uni- tarian and a Mason, from Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Had it not been for his being tapped for Bones, and his being awarded the mining medal, I rather doubt that he would have been invited to go to South Africa wh ich took him to the pinnacles of the engineering profession and led him into a le adership role in the opening up of the gold mines. He had a close personal and w orking friendship with Sir Abe Bailey, who I believe was a South African Fabia n socialist, and I understand he was an acquaintance of Cecil Rhodes. Upon return ing to the United States, he explored in Quebec, Canada and founded Noranda Mine s in the early twenties. 26"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"W HAT A ROLE MODEL FOR HIS DAUGHTERS ! My memories of him are all wonderful. He was a most generous, unspoiled fellow who preferred to spend his evenings in the c ompany of the less affluent on the West Side of NYC, eating hot dogs and drinki ng beer, rather than in his elegant suite at the Pierre Hotel on Fifth Avenue. I have a small silver trophy (cup), which I cherish, engraved \"Grandpa to Charlotte for swimming, 1938\" which he had made specially for me when I won a swimming race while on vacation with him at the Seigneury Club in Quebec. (I use it as a double shot measure in memory of grandpa who was an enthusiastic scotch dr inker!) Grandpa left for California in the late eighteen hu ndreds and worked at Grass Valley in a chlorination factory for a short while during the gold boom. He soon after was invited by the great John Hays Hammond to go to Africa, an invitation he declined, but later accepted from Thomas H. Leggatt . He arrived in the Rand in 1898 and spent twelve additional seasons (1902-1914) in charge of the mining operations of Norman and Company and Sir Abe Bailey. During th at time Thomson's major concerns were the Witwatersrand Deep, the Treasury and Great Central mines. Many other properties came under his charge, as well, so that by the time he left Africa, he was widely known to the gold-mining fraternity. I h ave a solid gold cigarette box, the inside cover of which is engraved with the signatur es of American mining engineers which they presented to him when he left the Rand i n 1914. During his stay in South Africa, Thomson saw servic e as a lieutenant in the British Army through the later phases of the Boer W ar. (He was in charge of protecting the mines from Boer sabotage.) It was Th omson's plan, on leaving the Rand in 1914, to engage in consulting practice in L ondon, England, principally for Sir Abe Bailey and his associates. He evidently worked closely with Bailey while in South Africa. I had a wonderful black and white photo of my grandfather and Sir Abe Bailey, but somehow it has been lost. World War I intervened while he was on holiday in t he United States, however, thus reserving grandpa's future for Canadian mining , and to Noranda Mines. (He was one of the principals in the discovery and development of copper mines in Canada.) The Anglo-American connections are clea r and of course, we are all aware of Carnegie's plan to bring America back to t he mother's bosom, something we are looking at today. (George Bush and Tony Blai r!) My Dad, Clifton Samuel Thomson, a graduate of Hotch kiss Boys School, class of 1924 at Yale, Columbia Law School, 1926, and a B onesman, was born in 1903 in Johannesburg, S.A., and lived there until 1914 w hen his family went to live in London for a while and then moved back to Englew ood, N.J., U.S.A. Dad was also a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon while at Y ale. This fraternity boasts many important members, including four Presidents o f the United States: Hayes, Bush, Sr. Bush, Jr. Roosevelt, and Ford. I have alw ays felt there was a very, very close connection between The Order and DKE. While i n London he attended Cheam Boys School, the very elitist school outside of London, which caters to British royalty. He detested every minute of it (co ld showers and lousy food) and his dislike of all things English, including the Br itish cruelty exhibited in the Boer 27"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY War, remained with him until he died in 1984. Dad w as, I believe, an unlikely candidate for Bones, being very down to earth, an i ndividualist, honest to the core, and Christian. He served as Mayor of Sands Po int, Long Island, N.Y., as a vestryman at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church at Port Washington, New York, and was elected councilman, Mendham Township Council, M endham, New Jersey. I knew three or four of his Bones classmates quite well: One, my sister's god- father, was I believe, instrumental in starting the Hemlock Society! This fellow who bounced me on his knees and told great stories ... was the last person I would ever have thought to be involved in bringing euthanasia to America. Dad also spent a couple of weeks at Bohemian Grove as a guest of his very close friend Edwin Blair, another Bones guy, who was nick-named \"Mr. Yale\" since he was such a good fund raiser. (Blair was also a partner with Chuck Spofford at Davis, Polk, Wardwell, Sunderland and Keindl ... see below .) Dad was not impressed by most of the activities at the Grove although he said a few presentations were noteworthy, food was excellent and accommodations t op of the line. He had one big, and I mean \"big\" problem with pompous people, and there was no shortage of such types at Bohemian Grove functions. Henry Al len, another Bones friend of Dad's, was a director of the American Civil Libe rties Union, set up by Amos Pinchot (The Order), and the daughter of his friend , Sherman Ewing, married a Rockefeller, but Ewing himself was not involved in any high level international or national policy planning. Dad was at Hotchkiss School with E.O. Matthiessen ( Bones 1923). An inter- esting aside follows: Matthiessen's daughter lived in the same town where I was on the local school board creating problems for the liberals ... in the seventies. She knew my father was her father's friend due to H otchkiss and Bones, but that didn't make any difference to her ... she went afte r me with a vengeance, often, 28"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"W HAT A ROLE MODEL FOR HIS DAUGHTERS ! and in public (even at social occasions!) due to my opposition to the federally- funded non-academic and no right/no wrong programs being implemented in the seventies. She was a carbon copy of her father about whom Tony has written in his newsletters. Her Dad is quoted on the jacket of Tony's book as saying \"As long as we have somebody from Bones who can bring p ressure on the committee, I should think we'll be all right.\" — E.O. Matthies sen (S&B 1923) to Donald Ogden Steward (S&B 1916) about \"Matty's\" upcoming a ppearance before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. In my opinion, the most important Bonesman in the C lass of 1924, a close friend and roommate of my father's, was Charles Mer ville Spofford, who rose to great heights in international law and politics. Da d, once, close to the end of his life, related to me an account of Spofford's promot ion to positions of international influence, much of which is covered in detail in Ya le '24- 24S and which I am including since Spofford provides a most important case study in how a very few members of the Order become global shakers and move rs. An account of Spofford's meteoric rise to fame, tak en from page 326 of Yale '24-24S, published in 1955, follows: Chuck, who took his LL.B. at Harvard in 1928, was w ith Isham, Lincoln & Beal in Chicago until 1930 and has since been wit h Davis, Polk, Wardwell, Sunderland & Kiendl, in which he became a partner i n 1940. He is a director of the Guaranty Trust Company of New York, the Distill ers Company, Ltd., and the Gordon's Dry Gin Company, Ltd., and is on the b oards of the Free Europe Committee, Union Theological Seminary, the Carnegie Corporation, the Juilliard Musical Foundation, the Juilliard School of Music, and the national council of the English-Speaking Union. He belongs to various b ar associations and to the Council on Foreign Relations. He went on active dut y as a lieutenant colonel in October, 1942, was assigned to the General Staff Corps, and had thirty-two months' service in the Eastern Theatre of Operation s and Mediterranean Theatre of Operations, ranking as a brigadier general at hi s release in December, 1945; he was in the Reserve from 1947 to 1954. In additio n to the U.S. Distinguished Service Medal and Purple Heart, he was awarded the Croix de Guerre with palm and was made a commander of the Legion of Honor, th e Order of the British Empire, the Order of Ishan Iftikhar (Tunisia), and the Order of St. Maurice and St. Lazarus (Italian). Chuck was appointed U.S. dep uty representative to the North Atlantic Council, with the rank of Ambassador , in June, 1950, the next month being elected chairman of the North Atlantic Council Deputies; for his work in this capacity (which continued until April 1952), he received the fol- lowing decorations: officer, Legion of Honor; grand officer, Order of the Crown (Belgium); commander with star, Order of the Falcon (Iceland). He is the author of \"The North Atlantic Treaty,\" in the Journal of t he Royal Empire Society, \"Toward Atlantic Security,\" in International Affair s, \"North Atlantic Security,\" in the Journal of the Royal United Services Institu tion, and \"NATO's Growing Pains\" in Foreign Affairs. 29"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY I remember his coming into my office in Middle East ern Affairs, U.S. Depart- ment of State, in 1956, at the peak of one of the c ontinuing Mid-East crises, to participate as a board member of The Suez Canal Com pany. After Chuck had divorced his wife of many years, he had a serious stroke, which confined him to a wheel chair. Surprisingly enough he remarried his former long- time secretary at Davis, Polk, a wonderful, down-to -earth woman with whom I had worked at one time. They lived in Easthampton , Long Island, in a house he bought from William Simon, former Secretary of t he Treasury. I relate these seemingly unimportant bits of information to reveal how even those who rise to great heights in world affairs encounter the same d ifficult problems in marriage, severe illnesses, etc. that we plain regulars encou nter, and that occasionally they survive through attachments to persons whose backgr ounds are totally different (normal?). His second wife, who came from an entire ly different background, took such wonderful care of Chuck until he passed on. Sh e probably turned out to be the most important person in his life, outside of h is children. There were other Bones friends of Dad's I knew fairly well but I don 't have any interesting stories. I'd say only 3 or 4 out of the 15 were involved in important U.S. Government or international policy decisions. Dad always supported the Bush family in its electio n efforts, while Mom, a true-blue conservative Catholic from Virginia, whos e family served on the Con- federate side during the Civil War, supported Reaga n. The Order would solicit campaign contributions for Bush from its members. D ad attended the reunions on Deer Island, but not frequently. Dad was a Senior Partner with Appleton, Rice, and P errin, a small Wall Street law firm. Lee Perrin, Bones 1906, was a very fine g entleman who I suspect brought Dad on board at the firm. (Connections help!) Dad w as also the attorney for a French company, the Matham Corporation, during Worl d War II. I remember that he received all sorts of pins (medals) from Matham for his service to the company during the war. I believe Matham was involved in ma nufacturing arms. Dad resigned his position with Matham due to its in volvement with the Nazis. He was very principled, and I'm sure not at all on the Bones' wavelength of sup- porting both sides (i.e. Hitler and Stalin). Of int erest and along the same lines was a comment he made to Alan Klotz, a Wall Street attorney, also a Bonesman from another year, regarding dropping the bomb on H iroshima. Dad said he told Klotz, who reacted in shock, that, \"we should have dropped it on Moscow instead.\" That doesn't jibe with Bones politics, do es it? My mother always jokingly said, \"One day Dad acts like a capitalist; the next day he acts like a communist.\" That's quite a comment, isn't it? I rather suspect that could be applied to most of those guys who received the same brainwashing at Yale. Isn't that known as cognitive dissonance in psychological circles? On a personal level, that is, his attitude towards my work, he was \"cool.\" Al- though he and I were very, very close as Dad and da ughter and did many things together (tennis, swimming, long walks, talks, etc. ), it always bothered him that I was critical of the public education system and U .S. foreign policy. (Although 30"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"W HAT A ROLE MODEL FOR HIS DAUGHTERS ! he would often make disparaging remarks about the \" striped pants\" guys running the world.) He once said he couldn't understand why I was opposed to world government and I responded \"Dad, I can't believe wh at you are saying ... whose Constitution will our country have?\" (He was a cons ervative, constitutionally oriented, and had been mayor of our town!) He lent back in his chair, took a long puff on his cigar and slowly uttered the following in a deep voice: \"Oh, Char, we'll take care of that when the time comes.\" He also onc e said when I complained about the national debt \"not to worry, we owe it to ourselves!\" Although he considered me a very good writer, he sa id, \"I don't agree with where you are coming from.\" He was brainwashed big time at Yale, especially considering how the brainwash lasted for such a lon g period of time (over the years) with someone who was so fair, honest, unspoi led, etc., and in constant pursuit of the truth. He was an avid reader ... I n ever saw him without a book in his lap. His favorite writer was Thoreau and he had read all the books in Will and Ariel Durant's The History of Civilization seri es. My sister and I spent the last year of his life wit h him at his home in Gladstone, New Jersey. He was dying of cancer and my sister an d I kept him at home; didn't allow him to be put in the hospital. Our mother was in a nursing home. Very sad they were separated like that at the end of the ir lives. He died in 1984 with his dog, Whiskers, a Welsh terrier, on the bed besi de him! 1984 was the year Phyllis Schlafly's book, Child Ab use in the Classroom, which was really half mine since I had written most of th e parts about the parents' testimony at U.S. Department of Education hearings. Phyllis and I worked on the book by phone, in order to have it available at the Republican Convention in Texas. Dad was able to hear our conversations ab out everything from death education to world government. His bedroom was on t he ground floor next to the kitchen where I sort of lived with the phone. A bout a week before he died he looked at me and said, \"If I had more time, I'd hel p you.\" That was so nice. He had also told me several months before he died t hat he wished he had been a farmer rather than a Wall Street lawyer, and I really believe he meant that. 31"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY When not in town with his Wall Street friends, at t he Downtown Association for lunch or in his office, all of which he surely enjoyed, he was painting land- scapes, cooking, walking the dogs, creating a small pond, or turning the earth in his garden, a plain down to earth person and the gr eatest friend to many, many people. He never turned down a request for legal or other advice ... was available to everyone, free, no matter rich or poor. A more g enerous person never lived. He was a man of few words, had a laid back personal ity, and was incredibly witty with a very dry sense of humor. What a role model for his daughters!

Some came to sell purloined objects. Some came to b abble. And some came because the office was open and there was no place else to go. Most of the time, I was called upon to deal with th e crazies, usually in the role of bouncer protecting the mostly female staff. On m ore than a few occasions, I had to physically remove such visitors. Often, though, the crazies came looking for me. Such was the case with the man in olive drab who ha d a story to tell. \"Hey Altman, someone's here to see you,\" said our r eceptionist. Great. When she said it like that, it usually meant another paranoid crack head was coming to call. I'd been visited by relatives of Jesus, descendents of UFO aliens and a man claiming to be great Caesar's ghos t. The least I could do, I figured, was humor the man and send h im, harm- lessly, on his way. I walked out of my office, to the front desk and gr eeted the man, a short, wiry guy with a craggily, weathered f ace and stringy hair. Instantly, I sensed there was something about him, something different than the other whackos who walked in off the street. Extending his hand, he introduced himself. \"I am Geronimo's great-great grandson,\" he said. \"Yeah? And my name is Moses,\" I thought to myself. 33 B "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY By the look on the receptionist's face, I could tel l that the man was making her nervous, so contrary to my usual rule, I invited hi m back to my office. I sat down and invited him to do the same, but he r efused, saying he was more comfortable standing. As he stood, he began to tell me about his past, wh ich, he claimed, included a stint in the US military, where he served with th e special forces. He made it a point to tell me how he'd killed people, though it wasn't quite clear to me whether the killings took place as a member of the military or on his own. Either way, I remember feeling just a might uneasy. He might have been hallucinat- ing about being related to Geronimo, but the look i n his eyes when he talked about killing people made me think that this guy was tell ing the truth about something. After a few minutes more of small talk, I asked him a question. \"So what brings Geronimo's great-great grandson to New Haven?\" I asked, a fairly legitimate question considering the circumst ances. And that's when he began to tell me an incredible s tory. \"I am here because my great-great grandfather Geron imo's bones are here,\" he said. That was fantastic enough. But, the more he talked, the more fantastic the story became. The bones, he said, were dug up by Prescott Bush, f ather of George Herbert Walker, the first President Bush. They were taken t o the Skull and Bones, a secret society on the Yale campus that counts as members a number of Presidents and other high-ranking government and military official s. The man, who said his name was Phillip Romero, said he wanted the bones returned to their rightful owner, the Apache. He as ked if I would be interested in writing a story. Well, of course I would be interested in writing a story about the President's father digging up Geronimo's bones and bringing the m to a secret society in New Haven. There was just one little problem, I tol d Romero, the man who claimed to be a killer. Being as tactful as possible, so as not to set him off unnecessarily, I explained that I needed more than his say-so to write a story implicating the father of the President in what amounts to a crime in the state o f Connecticut, specifically, the illicit harboring of bones. The great Apache chief's self-purported great-great grandson told me that such proof existed, in the form of a picture, which was in the hands of a man named Ned Anderson, a former tribal leader of the San Car los Apache tribal council. Anderson, said the man, had been tipped off about G eronimo's bones by a disgruntled Skull & Bonesman named \"Pat,\" who told Anderson that Prescott Bush and others dug up the Apache chief's remains f rom their burial plot at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and transported them to the To mb — the Skull & Bones' formidable stone headquarters on High Street in New Haven — where they are to this day said to be used in society rituals. 34"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"G ERONIMO ' S B ONES (In addition to becoming a cult figure for his effo rts to retrieve Geronimo's bones, Anderson, according to WaBun-Inini, of the W hite Earth Anishinabe Ojibwa Nation, would later be credited with helping to found Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition and coining the phrase \"Run, Jess e, Run,\" in conjunction with Jackson's nascent bid for the Presidency.) His story finished, Romero thanked me for his time, turned around and walked out my office. I never heard from him again. Anderson, on the other hand, I was in contact with frequently — though reaching him was no easy feat. He lived on a reservation more than 20 miles from t he nearest telephone and our conversations had to be scheduled far in advance so that he could hop a ride. When we did speak, Anderson told a fascinating stor y, about how he discovered the whereabouts of Geronimo's bones after a very pu blic battle with Geronimo's relatives, over where the great chief should be bur ied. Anderson wanted the remains moved to his reservatio n in San Carlos, Arizona. Geronimo's family, represented by Wendell Chino, a family member and leader of the Mescalero Apache tribe, wanted the remains to remain where they were, or at least where everyo ne thought they were, in Fort Sill, where Geronimo die d in captivity. Anderson and Chino were never able to resolve their dispute — Chino calling Anderson's bid \"a publicity stunt to attract tourists.\" But that was not the end of the story. The publicity, said Anderson, spurred a Bonesman named \"Pat\" to come forward and, perhaps out of guilt, tell Anderson that Geronimo was not buried i n Fort Sill, but was instead on a shelf in the \"Tomb. \" The bones, said Anderson, were dug up in 1918 by Prescott Bush — father of the first President Bu sh and grandfather of the second — along with some cohorts. In addition to telling Anderson about what happened to Geronimo's bones, \"Pat\" —whose real identity An- derson would never reveal despite my pleas, whimper s and other forms of persuasion — provided Anderson with a picture of what Anderson claimed are Geronimo's bones in New Haven. Anderson said he took that picture and tried to hav e his Senator at the time, Mo Udall, intervene. He also said he arranged a mee ting with then President George H. W Bush's brother Jonathan. \"Bush was taken aback when confronted with the evid ence,\" Anderson told me. Just how far aback was hard to ascertain when I finally tracked down Bush. He was cordial, but did not want to talk about the meeting. 35 "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY My research on the subject revealed that, with a la wyer willing to fight the battle, there might have been a case to investigate the corpse conundrum under Connecticut state law, which holds that it is unlaw ful to keep such remains. But no one I talked to was willing to represent And erson and everyone I talked to said no one would. Armed with Anderson's evidence, I tried to pay a vi sit to the Tomb. I slammed the great knocker, which bounced off the metal door with a tremen- dous thud. Eventually, someone answered and opened the door ever so slightly. I introduced myself and told the man why I was ther e. He refused to talk or even let me in. Taking a page out of the Obnoxious Salesman's Handb ook, I stuck my foot in the heavy metal door in an effort to continue ou r conversation. The man slammed the door on my foot in an effort to end it. Ultimately, his impatience (and pressure on my foot ) outlasted my patience and I removed my foot, allowing him to close the do or on me and any chance of my getting a comment from a Bonesman. Although Anderson was unsuccessful in finding anyon e to represent him and although I was unable to come to any definitive con clusion about Geronimo's bones, the story I wrote — Bones of Contention: Sku llduggery at Yale?— made a bit of a splash. A local TV station covered it and interviewed me and I received a call from an Italian news magazine. I left the New Haven Advocate in 1991 and the story about Geronimo's bones became a warm but distant memory until just a few y ears ago, when I began to read about the controversy in the CIA-Drugs Yaho o group and other places on the Internet, leading me to the conclusion that, no matter what happened, Geronimo's bones have legs. 36"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"P RESCOTT B USH , $1,500,000 AND A USCHWITZ How THE B USH F AMILY W EALTH I S L INKED T O T HE J EWISH H OLOCAUST T OBY R OGERS APPEASED IN C LAMOR M AGAZINE , M AY /J UNE \"2002 HILE THE ENRON SCANDAL currently unfolds, another B ush family business scandal lurks beneath the shadows o f history that may dwarf it.

Throughout the Bush family's decades of public life , the American press has gone out of its way to overlook one historical fact - th at through Union Banking Corpo- ration (UBC), Prescott Bush, and his father-in-law, George Herbert Walker, along with German industrialist Fritz Thyssen, financed A dolf Hitler before and during \"World War II. It was first reported in 1994 by Joh n Loftus and Mark Aarons in The Secret War Against the Jews: How Western Espion age Betrayed the Jewish People. The US government had known that many American comp anies were aiding Hitler, like Standard Oil, General Motors and Chase Bank, all of which were sanctioned after Pearl Harbor. But as The New York Times reporter Charles Higham later discovered, and published in his 1983 groundbreaking book, Trading With The Enemy; The Nazi American Money Plot 1933-1 949, \"the government smothered everything during and even after the war. \" Why? According to Higham, the US government believed \"a public scandal... would have drastically affected public morale, caused wid espread strikes and perhaps provoked mutinies in the armed services.\" Higham cl aims the government thought \"their trial and imprisonment would have made it im possible for the corporate boards to help the American war effort.\" However, Prescott Bush's banks were not just financ ing Hitler as previously reported. In fact, there was a distinct business li nk much deeper than Mr. Higham or Mr. Loftus knew at the time their books were pub lished. A classified Dutch intelligence file which was leak ed by a courageous Dutch intelligence officer, along with newly surfaced inf ormation from U.S. government archives, \"confirms absolutely,\" John Loftus says, the direct links between Bush, Thyssen and genocide profits from Auschwitz. The business connections between Prescott Bush and Fritz Thyssen were more direct than what has been previously written. This new information reveals how Prescott Bush and UBC, which he managed directly, p rofited from the Holocaust. A case can be made that the inheritors of the Presc ott Bush estate could be sued by survivors of the Holocaust and slave labor commu nities. To understand the complete picture of how Prescott Bush profited from the Holocaust, it is neces- sary to return to the year 1916, where it all began .

The \"Great War\" was spinning out of control, grinding away at Germa ny's resources and economy.

As the main supplier of t he German military, August Thyssen knew Germany would be defeated once the US entered the war. At 74, \"King\" August Thyssen knew he was also runni ng out of time. His first born \"prince\" Friedrich (Fritz) Thyssen, had been groome d at the finest technical business schools in Europe and was destined to inherit his f ather's estimated $100,000,000 fortune and an industrial empire located at Muehhlh eim on the Ruhr. In addition to Fritz, plans were also made for the second son Heinrich. At the outbreak of the war, Heinrich Thyssen discreetly ch anged his citizenship from German to Hungarian and married the Hungarian arist ocrat Baroness Margrit Bornemisza de Kaszon. Soon Heinrich Thyssen switche d his name to Baron Thyssen Bornemisza de Kaszon. Near the end of World War I, August Thyssen opened the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart in Rotterdam. The neutral Holland was t he perfect location outside of Germany to launder assets from the August Thyssen B ank in Berlin when the financial demands of the Allied forces surfaced. But the war ended much sooner than even Thyssen calculated and what developed caught the \"R ockefeller of the Ruhr\" off guard. On November 10, 1918, German socialists took over Berlin. The following morning at 5 a.m., what was left of Germany surrend ered to the Allies, officially ending World War I. \"At the time of the Armistice a nd the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, my Father and I were deeply saddened by the spectacle of Germany's abject humiliation,\" Thyssen recalled later in his autobio graphy, I Paid Hitler. After the war, chaos descended on Germany as food r an short. Winter was looming over a starving nation when on Dec. 7, 1918 , the socialist Spartacists League came knocking on the Thyssen Villa with arme d militia. August and Fritz were arrested and dragged from jail to jail across Germany for four days. Along the way, they were lined up in staged executions de signed to terrorize them. It worked. When released, the two Thyssens were hor rified at the new politi- cal climate in their beloved Germany. They could no t accept that Germany was responsible for its own demise. All Germany's probl ems, the Thyssens felt, \"have almost always been due to foreigners.\" It was the J ews, he and many others be- lieved, who were secretly behind the socialist move ment across the globe. Meanwhile Fritz's younger brother Baron Thyssen Bor nemisza de Kaszon moved to Rotterdam and became the principal owner o f the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart. All the Thyssens needed now was an American branch. 1920s: T HE B USINESS T IES T HAT B IND AILROAD BARON E.H.

He lived life to the fullest, owning mansions around the East Coast and one of the most extravagant apartments in Manhattan . His hobbies were golf, hunting, drinking scotch and beating his sons to a pulp. Elsie Walker, one of Walker's grandchildren described Walker as a \"tough old bastard\" whose children had no love \"for their father.\" He was also a relig ious bigot who hated Catholics, although his parents raised him to be one. Accordin g to other sources, he also did not like Jews. In 1922, Averell Harriman traveled to Germany to se t up a WA. Harriman & Co. branch in Berlin. The Berlin branch was also run by Walker. While in Germany, he met with the Thyssen family for the fir st time. Harriman agreed to help the Thyssens with their plan for an American b ank. The following year, a wounded Germany was growing s icker. The government had no solution and froze while Germany rotted from within. With widespread strikes and production at a near standstill, Fritz Thyssen later recalled, \"We were at the worst time of the inflation. In Berlin the g overnment was in distress. It was ruined financially. Authority was crumbling. In Sax ony a communist government had been formed and the Red terror, organized by Ma x Hoelz, reigned through the countryside. The German Reich ... was now about to crumble.\" In October, 1923, an emotionally desperate Fritz Th yssen went to visit one of his and Germany's great military heroes, General Er ich Ludendorff. During the 1918 socialist rule in Berlin, Ludendorff organized a military resistance against the socialists and the industrialists were in great debt to him. When Thyssen met with Ludendorff, they discussed Germany's econo mic collapse. Thyssen was apocalyptic, fearing the worst was yet to come. Lud endorff disagreed. \"There is but one hope,\" Ludendorff said, \"Adolph Hitler and the National Socialist party.\" Ludendorff respected Hitler immensely. \"He is the o nly man who has any political sense.\" Ludendorff encouraged Thyssen to join the N azi movement. \"Go listen to him one day\" he said to Thyssen. Thyssen followed General Ludendorff's advice and we nt to a number of meetings to hear Hitler speak. He became mesmerized by Hitle r. \"I realized his orator gifts and his ability to lead the masses. What impressed me most however was the order that reigned over his meetings, the almost military discipline of his followers.\" Thyssen arranged to meet privately with Hitler and Ludendorff in Munich. Hitler told Thyssen the Nazi movement was in financ ial trouble, it was not growing fast enough and was nationally irrelevant. Hitler n eeded as much money as possible to fight off the Communists/Jewish conspiracy again st Europe. Hitler envisioned a fascist German monarchy with a nonunion, antilock national work force. Thyssen was overjoyed with the Nazi platform. He ga ve Hitler and Luden- dorff 100,000 gold marks ($25,000) for the infant N azi party. Others in the steel and coal industries soon followed Thyssen's l ead, although none came close to matching him. Many business leaders in Germany s upported Hitler's secret union-hating agenda. However, some donated because they feared they would be left out in the cold if he actually ever seized power. 40"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"P RESCOTT B USH , $1.5 M ILLION D OLLARS AND A USCHWITZ Most industry leaders gave up on Hitler after his f ailed coup in 1923. While Hitler spent a brief time in jail, the Thyssens, th rough the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart, opened the Union Banking Corporation i n 1924. U NION B ANKING C ORPORATION ARLY IN 1924, HENDRICK J. KOUWENHOVEN, the managing director of Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart, traveled to New York to meet with Walker and the Harriman brothers. Together, they es tabhshed The Union Banking Corporation. The UBC's headquarters was located at the same 39 Broadway address as Harriman & Co. As the German economy recovered through the mid to late '20s, Walker and Harriman's firm sold over $50,000,000 worth of Germ an bonds to American investors, who profited enormously from the economi c boom in Germany. In 1926, August Thyssen died at the age of 84. Fritz w as now in control of one of the largest industrial families in Europe. He quick ly created the United Steel Works (USW), the biggest industrial conglomerate in German history. Thyssen hired Albert Volger, one of the Ruhr's most influen tial industrial directors, as director General of USW. Thyssen also brought Fredich Flick, another German family juggernaut, on board. Flick owned coal and steel industries throug hout Germany and Poland and desperately wanted to invest into the Thyssen e mpire. One of the primary motivations for the Thyssen/Flick massive steel and coal merger was suppressing the new labor and socialist movements. That year in New York, George Walker decided to giv e his new son in law, Prescott Bush, a big break. Walker made Bush a vice president of Harriman & Co. Prescott's new office employed many of his classmat es from his Yale class of 1917, including Roland Harriman and Knight Woolley. The t hree had been close friends at Yale and were all members of Skull and Bones, th e mysterious on-campus secret society. Despite the upbeat fraternity atmosphere a t Harriman & Co., it was also a place of hard work, and no one worked harder than Prescott Bush. In fact, Walker hired Bush to help him supervise th e new Thyssen/Flick United Steel Works. One section of the USW empire was the Consolidated Silesian Steel Corporation and the Upper Silesian Coal and Steel C ompany located in the Silesian section of Poland. Thyssen and Flick paid Bush and Walker generously, but it was worth every dime. Their new business arr angement pleased them all financially, and the collective talents of all four men and their rapid success astonished the business world. In the meantime Hitler and the Nazi party were brok e. Since the German economic recovery, members and donations had dried up, leaving the Nazi move- ment withering on the vine. In 1927, Hitler was des perate for cash; his party was slipping into debt. Hitler told his private secreta ry Rudolf Hess to shake down wealthy coal tycoon and Nazi sympathizer Emil Kirdo rf. Kirdorf paid off Hitler's debt that year but the following year, he too had n o money left to contribute. 41 E"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY In 1928, Hitler had his eyes on the enormous Barlow Palace located in Bri- ennerstrasse, the most aristocratic section of Muni ch. Hitler wanted to convert the palace into the Nazi national headquarters and change its name to the Brown House but it was out of his price range. Hitler tol d Hess to contact Thyssen. After hearing the Hess appeal, Thyssen felt it was time t o give Hitler a second chance. Through the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart, Thysse n said he \"placed Hess in possession of the required funds\" to purchase and r edesign the Palace. Thyssen later said the amount was about 250,000 marks but leading Nazis later claimed that just the re-molding cost over 800,000 marks (equiva lent to $2 million today). Regardless of the cost, Hitler and Thyssen became c lose friends after the pur- chase of the Brown House. At the time, neither knew how influential that house was to become the following year when, in 1929, the gre at depression spread around the world. With the German economic recovery up in flames, Hitler knew there was going to be a line of industrialists out the do or waiting to give him cash. 1930s; H ITLER R ISES - T HYSSEN /B USH C ASH I N HYSSEN WOULD LATER TRY TO CLAIM that his weekends w ith Hitler and Hess at his Rhineland castles were not personal but strictly business and that he did not approve of most of Hitler's ideas, but t he well-known journalist R.G Waldeck, who spent time with Thyssen at a spa in th e Black Forest, remembered quite differently. Waldeck said when he and Thyssen would walk through the cool Black Forest in 1929-30, Thyssen would tell Wa ldeck that he believed in Hitler. He spoke of Hitler \"with warmth\" and said t he Nazis were \"new men\" that would make Germany strong again. With the depr ession bleeding Europe, Thyssen's financial support made Hitler's rise to p ower almost inevitable. The great Depression also rocked Harriman & Co. The following year, Har- riman & Co. merged with the London firm Brown/Shipl ey. Brown/Shipley kept its name, but Harriman & Co. changed its name to Br own Brothers, Harriman. The new firm moved to 59 Wall St. while UBC stayed at 39 Broadway. Averell Harriman and Prescott Bush reestablished a holding company called The Har- riman 15 Corporation. One of the companies Harriman had held stock in was the Consolidated Silesian Steel Company. Two thirds of the company was owned by Friedrich Flick. The rest was owned by Harriman. In December 1931, Fritz Thyssen officially joined t he Nazi party. When Thyssen joined the movement, the Nazi party was gai ning critical mass around Germany. The charismatic speeches and persona of Hi tler, the depression and the Thyssen's Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart all contr ibuted to Hitler's sudden rise in popularity with the German people. In September 1932, Thyssen invited a group of elite German industrial tycoons to his castle to meet with Hitler. They spent hours questioning Hitler, who an- swered all their questions with the \"utmost satisfa ction,\" Thyssen remembered. The money poured in from the industrial circles mos tly due to Hitler's \"monar- chistic attitude\" towards labor and issues of class . 42 T"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"P RESCOTT B USH , $1.5 M ILLION D OLLARS AND A USCHWITZ But by November, German voters grew weary of Hitler s antidemocratic tenden- cies and turned to the Communist party, which gaine d the most seats in the fall election. The Nazis lost a sweeping 35 seats in the Reichstag, but since the Nazis were already secretly negotiating a power sharing a lliance with Hindenberg that would ultimately lead to Hitler declaring himself d ictator, the outcry of German voters was politically insignificant. By 1934, Hindenberg was dead and Hitler completely controlled Germany. In March, Hitler announced his plans for a vast new highway system. He wanted to connect the entire Reich with an unprecedented w ide road design, especially around major ports. Hitler wanted to bring down une mployment but, more importantly, needed the new roads for speedy milita ry maneuvers. Hitler also wanted to seriously upgrade Germany's m ilitary machine. Hitler ordered a \"rebirth of the German army\" and contract ed Thyssen and United Steel Works for the overhaul. Thyssen's steel empir e was the cold steel heart of the new Nazi war machine that led the way to World War II, killing millions across Europe. Thyssen's and Flick's profits soared into the hundr eds of millions in 1934 and the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart and UBC in New York were overflowing with money. Prescott Bush became managing director of UB C and handled the day-to- day operations of the new German economic plan. Bus h's shares in UBC peaked with Hitler's new German order. But while productio n rose, cronyism did as well. On March 19, 1934, Prescott Bush handed Averell Har riman a copy of that day's New York Times. The Polish government was app lying to take over Consoli- dated Silesian Steel Corporation and Upper Silesian Coal and Steel Company from \"German and American interests\" because of ram pant \"mismanagement, excessive borrowing, fictitious bookkeeping and gam bling in securities.\" The Pol- ish government required the owners of the company, which accounted for over 45% of Poland's steel production, to pay at least i ts full share of back taxes. Bush and Harriman would eventually hire attorney John Fo ster Dulles to help cover up any improprieties that might arise under investi gative scrutiny. Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939 ended the debat e about Consolidated Sile- sian Steel Corporation and Upper Silesian Coal and Steel Company. The Nazis knocked the Polish Government off Thyssen, Flick an d Harriman's steel company and were planning to replace the paid workers. Orig inally Hitler promised Stalin they would share Poland and use Soviet prisoners as slaves in Polish factories. Hitler's promise never actually materialized and he eventually invaded Russia. 1940s: B USINESS A S U SUAL ONSOLIDATED SILESIAN STEEL CORPORATION was located near the Polish town of Oswiecim, one of Poland's richest mineral r egions.

The prisoners of Auschwitz who were able 43 C"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY to work were shipped to 30 different companies. One of the companies was the vast Consolidated Silesian Steel Corporation. \"Nobody's made the connection before between Consol idated Silesian Steel Corporation, Auschwitz and Prescott Bush,\" John Lof tus told Clamor. \"That was the reason why Auschwitz was built there. The coal deposits could be processed into either coal or additives for avia tion gasoline.\" Even though Thyssen and Flick's Consolidated Steel was in their possession, Hitler's invasions across Europe spooked them, brin ging back memories of World War I. Thyssen and Flick sold Consolidated Steel to UBC. Under the complete control of Harriman and management of Bush, the com pany became Silesian American Corporation which became part of UBC and H arriman's portfolio of 15 corporations. Thyssen quickly moved to Switze rland and later France to hide from the terror about to be unleashed by the N azi war machine he had helped build. A portion of the slave labor force in Poland was \"m anaged by Prescott Bush,\" according to a Dutch intelligence agent. In 1941, s lave labor had become the lifeblood of the Nazi war machine. The resources of Poland's rich steel and coal field played an essential part in Hitler's invasion of Europe. According to Higham, Hitler and the Fraternity of A merican businessmen \"not only sought a continuing alliance of interests for the duration of World War II, but supported the idea of a negotiated peac e with Germany that would bar any reorganization of Europe along liberal line s. It would leave as its residue a police state that would place the Fraternity in p ostwar possession of financial, industrial, and political autonomy.\" Six days after Pearl Harbor and the US declaration of war at the end of 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Secretary of the T reasury Henry Morgenthau and US Attorney General Francis Biddle signed the T rading With the Enemy Act, which banned any business interests with US en emies of war. Prescott Bush continued with business as usual, aiding the Nazi i nvasion of Europe and supply- ing resources for weaponry that would eventually be turned on American solders in combat against Germany. On October 20, 1942, the U.S. government had had en ough of Prescott Bush and his Nazi business arrangements with Thyssen. Ov er the summer, The New York Tribune had exposed Bush and Thyssen, whom the Tribune dubbed \"Hitlers Angel.\" When the US government saw UBC's books, the y found out that Bush's bank and its shareholders \"are held for the benefit of... members of the Thyssen family, [and] is property of nationals... of a desi gnated enemy country.\" The list of seven UBC share holders was: E.

On November 17, 1942, The US government al so took over the Silesian American Corporation, but did not prosecute Bush fo r the reasons Higham noted earlier. The companies were allowed to operate with in the Government Alien Property custodian office with a catch — no aiding the Nazis. In 1943, while still owning his stock, Prescott Bush resigned from UBC a nd even helped raise money for dozens of war-related causes as chairman of the National War Fund. After the war, the Dutch government began investiga ting the whereabouts of some jewelry of the Dutch royal family that was sto len by the Nazis. They started looking into books of the Bank voor Handel en Schee pvaart. When they discovered the transaction papers of the Silesian American Cor poration, they began asking the bank manager H.J. Kowenhoven a lot of questions. Ko uwenhoven was shocked at the discovery and soon traveled to New York to info rm Prescott Bush. According to Dutch intelligence, Kouwenhoven met with Prescott s oon after Christmas, 1947. Two weeks later, Kouwenhoven apparently died of a h eart attack. 1950s: B USH S ELLS UBC S TOCK Y 1948, FRITZ THYSSEN'S LIFE WAS IN RUINS. After be ing jailed by the Nazis, he was jailed by the Allies and interrogated extens ively, but not completely, by US investigators. Thyssen and Flick were ordered to pay reparations and served time in prison for their atrocious crimes against h umanity. On February 8, 1951, Fritz Thyssen died bitterly in Argentina at the age of 78. Thyssen was angry at the way he was treated by Euro pe after the war and how his- tory would remember him as Hitler's most important and prominent financier. When Thyssen died, the Alien Property Custodian rel eased the assets of the Union Banking Corporation to Brown Brothers Harriman. The remaining stockholders cashed in their stocks and quietly liquidated the r est of UBC's blood money. Prescott Bush received $1.5 million for his share i n UBC. That money enabled Bush to help his son, George Herbert Walker Bush, t o set up his first royalty firm, Overby Development Company, that same year.

On O ctober 8 th , 1972, Prescott Bush died of cancer and his will was enacted soon a fter. In 1980, when George H.W Bush was elected vice pres ident, he placed his father s family inherence in a blind trust.

Standard Oi l, invested millions in IG Farben, who opened a gasoline factory within Auschw itz in 1940. The billions \"Stamps\" inherited had more blood on it then Bush, so the paper trail of UBC stock would be safe during his 12 years in presiden tial politics. It has been 60 years since one of the great money l aundering scandals of the 20 th century ended and only now are we beginning to see the true historical aspects of this important period of world history, a history that the remaining Holocaust survivors beg humanity to \"never forget.\" Loftus believes history will view Prescott Bush as harshly as Thyssen. \"It is bad enough that the Bush family helped raise the money for Thyssen to give Hitler his start in the 1920s, but giving aid and comfort to the enemy in time of war is treason. The Bush bank helped the Thyssens make the Nazi steel that killed Allied solders. As bad as financing the Nazi war ma chine may seem, aiding and abetting the Holocaust was worse. Thyssen's coal mi nes used Jewish slaves as if they were disposable chemicals. There are six milli on skeletons in the Thyssen family closet, and a myriad of criminal and histori cal questions to be answered about the Bush family's complicity.\" There is no question that the Bush family needs to donate at least $1.5 mil- lion to the proper holocaust reparation fund. Since Prescott Bush is dead, the only way to compensate is for the main inheritors o f his estate to make amends with surviving slaves and the families of slaves wh o died in Bush and Thyssen's coal mines. If the Bush family refuses to contribut e the money to compensate for Prescott Bush's involvement in the Holocaust, it is like denying the Holocaust itself and their role in one of the darkest moments in world history.

This Yale succession is historic. Never before have three (or even two) suc cessive U.S. presidents studied at the same university.

In addition, Big Money's grip on education and media has helped the Yale presidents advance Am erica's post-Cold War bid for military and economic empire without ever consu lting or informing voters. Finally, it was on the Yale presidents' watch that Big Money corrupted and inflated corporate and political America until the bubble bu rst, plunging the world into a recession that economists say could last for year s. No economy, national or global, can stand forever o n a corrupt political base. Healthy societies, like healthy families, require t rust. The seismic convergence of ethics and economics that toppled Japanese and Amer ican markets in 1991 and 2000, respectively, now rattles the entire world. C orruption and terror, widely seen as two unethical sides of the same coin of oil and empire, depress financial markets around the globe. In America, the Dow Jones average reflects a genera l loss of faith in institu- tions fueled by Machiavellian venality in politics and by Enronitis in business. The restoration of integrity — a sea change in Amer ica's civic and commercial life — is the task of a generation. It entails crea ting a new \"balance of public and private interests in the global economy,\" writes Je ffrey Garten of Yale's School of Management. If not apparent now, the need for ch ange will become clear as investor mistrust causes market rally after market rally to fizzle. Does the United States, in its commitment to freedo m and democratic values, have the will to effect change? And does Yale, as a laboratory for future leaders, have the will to lead the way in imagining and implement ing change? The unwillingness of Japan's elite universities to produce a generati on of tough-minded reformers helps explain why that former economic superpower, now in its thirteenth year of recession, could be stagnate for years to come. Will America be next? Significantly, the Ivy League aura that shields the Yale succession from scrutiny is fading. In Secrets of the Tomb, a recent history of Skull and Bones, Yale grad Alexandra Robbins, SY '98, shows how four generatio ns of Bonesmen created the Bush dynasty that comprises two thirds of Yale' s presidential troika. Looking ahead to 2004, Robbins describes a possible Bush/Ke rry contest as \"the first Bones versus Bones presidential race.\" In this pairing, Yale comes off more as a club for oligarchs than as a laboratory for leaders. Three more Yale-trained presidential h opefuls bolster this impression: Vermont Governor Howard Dean, PC '71, and Senators Joe Lieberman, MC '64, LAW '67, and Hillary Clinton, LAW '67. In 1949, Yale, in its wisdom, sent Bonesman Buckley and \"barbarian\" Sewall to Freshman Commons to encourage the class of '53 t o pursue success and un- derstanding. Today, Yale's silence on the Yale succ ession suggests that Yale, to its peril, may be pursuing success alone. The cure for non-reflection is thoughtful dialogue. The stakes are high. Let the dialogue beg in. 48"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"R EFLECTING ON THE Y ALE S UCCESSION A DDENDUM ; T HE G LASS - TOP T ABLE C ONVERSATION S YOU KNOW BY NOW, my father, Richard B. Sewall, taught English at Yale for forty years. In the 1960s, he was the first Master of Ezra Stiles College. He retired in 1976. In June of last year, ten months before his death last April at age 95, he flew from Boston to Chicago to spend three months with me. In his last years he suffered from dementia, a close cousin to full- blown Alzheimer's. He stopped writ- ing letters and reading newspapers. Although he could take phone calls, he no longer made them. Most of the time, he seemed to be withdrawing from the world. One evening in 1999, while he was still at his belo ved country home in Bethany, outside of New Haven, I had phoned him and found hi m utterly disoriented. \"Steve,\" he pleaded, \"I don't know where I am. What are all these books doing on the walls?\" He was referring to the bookshelves of the cozy stu dy with the little wood burning fireplace where for twenty years he had worked on h is National Book Award-winning biography of Emily Dickenson. He was speaking from the house where he and my mother had enjoyed forty years of idyllic rural life, and where, since her death from pancreatic cancer in 1975, he had been bound and determined to end his days, like the New Eng- lander he was, even at the cost of being apart from his three sons. In his last years, he pursued a number of quests. O ne related to Yale. Sometimes after an afternoon nap he would appear in a jacket and ti e. Glancing at his watch, he would say he had to be downtown at Yale in an hour to giv e a lecture. \"What about, Dad?' I once asked. \"I don't know,\" he said, with a hint of annoyance in his voice, \"Whatever they want me to lecture about.\" Another quest was to reunite with his family of bir th. Just before we moved him to safety with my brother Rick's family near Boston, he would tell us he was waiting to be picked up and driven back to his childhood home in Rye, New York. His home in Bethany, with its splendid prospect of the New Haven reservo ir and West Rock in the far distance, was now a mere way station in his search for a dest ination that always eluded him. One of the joys of living with very old people is t he knowledge that not all of their quests are imaginary One of my father's real-life q uests was visible in the luminous look of recognition he gave me when we met at O'Hare air port last June.

Later that summer, I asked him what keeps him going. \"Well,\" he said, \"I get to eat three good meals a day. And I like being around you guys.\" We hadn't seen each other in months. And I yearned to talk with him about the book I wanted to write. How would our conversation go? Whe re would it take us? I had no idea. Yet I knew it would be the latest installment in a running dialogue about Yale, education and, in effect, the modern world that began in 1965 while he was at Ezra Stiles, and where I lived while completing a Masters degree in teaching at Yale. That was an eventful year for me. I studied Romantic poetry with Harold Bloom, sang with the Original Golden Stars, a New Haven go spel quartet, watched Vietnam War hearings conducted by Senator William Fulbright and his Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the color TV at the Yale Law School din ing hall, I also met Allard K. Lowenstein, the Yale-trained lawyer, civil rights a ctivist and future Congressman who then was building the student-based antiwar movemen t that in 1968 would unseat a sitting president, Lyndon Baines Johnson. Al Lowenstein was the only visitor who was welcome to Stiles at any hour, day or night. He could wake my parents at midnight and within min utes be munching on a sandwich of his own, enthralling us with tales of political intrigue at the highest levels. The highlight of '65-'66 for me, however, was the E nglish class I taught at Troup Junior High School in New Haven to 30 ninth grade boys dia gnosed as slow learners. Most of these youngsters were nothing of the sort. They wer e students in a failed school system and residents of a failing city. By 1990, the City o f New Haven, decimated by gangs and drugs, would have the highest per-capita murder rat e of any city in America. On my last day at Troup in 1966, school Principal F rank J. Carr asked me what I would change at Troup if could change just one thin g. I said the school needed textbooks that were less than six years old. In response, he told me that while the New Haven Board of Education would spend $400,000 that summer on re novations for the Troup dining room, it would spend only $50,000 that year for tex tbooks for the entire system, grades 1 through 12. In those days, fat cat general contractors ran the New Haven Board of Education. It was Big Money at the local level. I wonder who contr ols that Board today. My year at Troup opened my eyes to the world. My st udents had problems, but my students were not the problem. To see if they could write, I assigned on the first day of class a one-page answer to the question, \"What happened in English class today?\" The paper Joe McVety (not his real name) handed me next day began , \"At 9:27, Mr. Sewall walked into room 314 wearing his threadbare jacket.\" This kid c ould write. Another student, David Johns, was brighter than most people I met at Harva rd, Yale and U. C. Berkeley. It was not IQ problems but bad schooling and person al problems that held these stu- dents back. Take Dexter Matthews, a young man with a bladder problem but no written permission to leave class. Normally well behaved, D exter would stand up and glare at me whenever I refused his urgent requests to go to the bathroom. Well into the school year I asked students to write a story in which they tell me an enormous lie, wild and crazy, In his paper, Joe McV ety championed Dexter's cause with a terrific yarn about how, after a global search, d etective Dexter had finally tracked the evil Mr. Sewall down to the men's room of the Seavi ew Hotel in Paris, France, and, with a tremendous punch, knocked him clear through the s kylight window. 50"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"R EFLECTING ON THE Y ALE S UCCESSION The class howled with delight when I read Joe's pap er aloud. But it still hadn't dawned on me that maybe Dexter did need to go to the John. One day near the end of the school year, Dexter, in desperation, pulled a knife on me. Standing wide-eyed at his desk, he looked far more scared than I. The class froze. I told him scornfully to put away the knife, go take a lea k, and be back in class in two minutes. He did. Finally I saw that Dexter wasn't trying to con me. But I can't say I taught him anything in English that year. Then there was Anthony Tomasino, whose mom had a fr esh-baked chocolate cake waiting for me when I visited her home to find out why her son was acting up in class. When I saw the front door had six locks on it, Mrs. Tomasino said that the sixth one was there because Anthony, a sleepwalker who still slept in his mom's bed, had learned to unlock the first five in his sleep. At supper throughout the year, I regaled my parents with stories like these. But I learned less about teaching than I should have. My supervising teacher spent a total of 10 minutes with me during entire school year. Ya le had never told me to expect any help from her, so I didn't. Still, after class most days, I wandered the school, taught as a substitute, or visited classes overseen by battle-s carred souls who had stopped teaching years ago, or never started. I got to know the scho ol. Although my father never visited my students at Tro up, the late Paul Weiss did. Paul was a family friend, a Fellow at Stiles and a legen d in the Yale philosophy department. He was also one of Yale's great teachers. What a day t hat was. Informed that a Yale professor was coming to class, my students expected John Wayn e. But when Paul Weiss entered the room — the gnarliest, most eccentric looking gu y you ever saw in your life — they thought they had got Mr. McGoo. What they had was an incarnation of Socrates. Paul confronted them with Archimedes' paradox of the race between the hare and the tortoi se. The discussion was pretty good. It came down to a contest between Paul and the super-s harp David Johns, who loved to argue, but who had a chip on his shoulder that kept him an d Paul from coming to terms. My most memorable moment at Troup, it turns out, wa s with my least memorable student. Nothing seemed to stand out about Kenny Bro wn. But here he was one day, in the passenger seat of my '65 green WV, getting a ri de to the Dixwell Avenue bus after spending 45 minutes with me in after school detenti on. Kenny and I were on bad terms that day and neither of us felt like talking. Final ly I broke the silence and asked him what he wanted to do when he got out of high school. \"I just want to get a job,\" he said in voice I had never heard before. It was low and guttural, like a man's. Dead serious. And yet despa iring. What he yearned for in life, at age 15, was a job. What did I yearn for when I w as 15? Stamps, girls and soccer. We talked. From then on, I respected Kenny Brown. At supper that night at the long rustic wooden dini ng table at Ezra Stiles, I told my parents that schools like Troup had broken the Jeff ersonian promise of universal public education. My dad agreed. In the years to come, we came to feel that this promise — this fundamental right and indispensable cornerstone of democracy—survived at the national level mainly, and merely, in the \"equal opportunity \" and \"no child left behind\" platitudes of public figures who knew full well that American schools were sending millions of youngsters into the world utterly unprepared to sur vive in it. 51"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWEREUL S ECRET S OCIETY Troup Junior High School brought out the Jonathan K ozoll in both of us. The gap between what Yale offered students and what the City of New Haven offered students was not only wrong, it was all but criminal. And we knew that this gap, if not corrected, would ultimately prove fatal to democracy itself. Several years after granting me the M.A.T degree in 1966, Yale summarily terminated its rickety M.A.T. program and replaced it with one that has made improvements in the New Haven schools, and, by example, in schools nati onwide. As the response of a torch-bearing university to th e developing crisis in American education, however, my father and I felt this progr am was a drop in the bucket. The need, as we saw it, was for a Yale School of Educat ion that would rival in size, quality and influence Yale's schools of law, management and medicine. Let this school train superb teachers and principals, much as Yale trains superb lawyers, businessmen and doctors. Why is it, we asked ourselves, that great universit ies like Yale, in the quest to explore and to master every aspect of nature and every corn er of the world, were so slow to see the obvious: the critical role of universal public educ ation in sustaining a viable democracy? To this paradox, we took bittersweet comfort in T S . Eliot's celebrated account of the belatedness of all self-knowledge: We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time. At the glass-top table with my father last June, th e knowledge that Eliot speaks of, and the day that my father and I had hoped for, seemed farther off than ever. The world had entered the era of Enronitis and the War on Terror. My father had finished his meal. We had discussed f amily matters. I fell silent, won- dering how I would resume the dialogue that had gui ded me over the past 35 years. His eyes, sunken and watery, were fixed on me. Age be d amned, I told myself, we're gonna talk, full throttle, just like we always have. At first I didn't let on that I wanted to write a b ook. I didn't have the nerve. Instead, I gave him the big picture, a sound-bite history of the 1990s, as if he had just gotten back from the planet Mars. I told him about the end of the cold war, the rise of the global economy, the boom in tech stocks, the bursti ng of the tech bubble, and the War on Terror triggered by 9/11. He took it all in. For well over an hour, his eyes would neither wander or nor waiver. I told him about the three Big Money \"leadership iss ues\" noted in the Yale Herald piece: campaign finance, America's post-Cold War dri ve toward global empire, and the endemic corruptions exposed by the bursting of the tech bubble. And I mentioned a fourth issue: the CIA's role in advancing the global drug trade that had corroded the American system of justice and decimated nearly eve ry city in the nation, including New Haven and Chicago, the two cities I knew best. I showed him my copy of the essential book on this topic, The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade, by Alfred W McCo y, a Yale Ph.D. who teaches at the University of Wisconsin. 52"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"R EFLECTING ON THE Y ALE S UCCESSION Then I brought it all home with a unifying insight. After several months of research, the idea of a Yale succession of U.S. presidents — Bush/ Clinton/Bush and their possible Yale- trained successors — had suddenly dawned on me. Ome ns of Ivy League oligarchy! To personalize this point, I placed on the glass-to p table copy of the American Heritage Dictionary that he had handed me in 1975. \"Read the entry for perquisite,\" he had said then, with undisguised pride. I asked him to look a t it now. I read the entry to him, including the example of usage that follows the def inition: \"Politics was the perquisite of the upper classes. (Richard B. Sewall)\" He beamed and grasped my hand warmly. A former stud ent of his, later a harmless drudge of a lexicographer at Random House, had recal led it from class, honored him with the attribution, and sent him the dictionary. Pondering the \"end of all our-exploring\" belatednes s of my discovery of the Yale suc- cession, it struck me that Yale's string of White H ouse occupants was itself hidden in plain view, celebrated and promoted by Yale, yet sc reened from critical analysis by 300 years of Ivy League venerability. What was screened from analysis ran deeper still. N ow I had to talk with my father about the covert Yale. It will not surprise you to hear that two highly se cretive, Yale-related institutions, CIA and Skull and Bones, are the wellsprings of this concep t. The origins of Skull and Bones, however, just might. I told my father how William Huntington Russell, valedictorian of the Yale class of 1832, and recently returned from a transformativ e experience at a university-based secret society in Germany, had founded Skull and Bones with drug money provided by his uncle, Samuel Russell, an entrepreneur whose fleet of spee dy Yankee Clippers had made him a fortune by transporting opium from Turkey, India and Burma to Canton and Shanghai in the so-called China Trade of the 19th century. As his past students never cease telling me, Richard Sewall was among the most patient of men. For this reason, the rare moments of anger I saw in him as a child have stayed with me. One such, a recurrent one, had to do with Skull and Bones. At tea with Yale people in our living room, the mere mention of Bones would prompt him to declare it a \"curse on the academic life of the university.\" Having thrown down this gauntlet, he would fall sil ent, giving others the option of pursuing or dropping it. Sometimes someone would pu rsue it. That is how I first heard about the huge archive of old term papers, covering much of Yale's undergraduate course offering, that Bonesmen could touch up and resubmit as their own work. It was institu- tionalized plagiarism, he felt, and he was furious at Yale's inability to stop it. In recent months, in overheated yet by no means uns ubstantial online histories of Skull & Bones written by \"outlaw historians\" like Antony Su tton, Kris Millegan, Webster Tarpley and Anton Chaitkin, I had found weightier reasons to be concerned with Bones. Before sharing a few with my father, I wanted first to see if he could r ecall his old attacks on Bones. So I asked him. \"Sure I do,\" he replied, \"but more than that, those guys were trying to run the whole damned university!\" This, to put it mildly, was news to me. Later I wou ld read that Yale presidents have been Bonesmen or related to Bonesmen for 84 of the la st 105 years up the time of his retirement in 1976 (See Appendix I) How, I asked, was Bones trying to run the university ? His response, while an answer to a different question, was passionate in its conv iction. \"Skull and Bones will never succeed in running the university,\" he said. \"Yale is too big and too diverse a place to be controlled by any one group.\" Suddenly, he was back 53"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY in the 1950s, fighting some old battle that I had n ever heard about and never would. Sensing my interest, he cautioned me: \"Watch out. Y ou can never prove anything against those guys. They cover up everything they do.\" For a moment, I had a queasy feeling of tilting at windmills. But anticipating that my father, even at age 95, would want documentation, I had at hand materials photocopied from the U. S. Government Documents Office at North western University. These made reference to several Bonesmen, one of whom was the f irst of three generations of Bush family members who were Bonesmen. I showed him four U.S. Treasury Department vesting orders issued in late 1941, after Pearl Harbor, and ordering the confiscation, under the terms of the Trading with the Enemy Act, of the assets of four corporations set u p and run by Averell Harriman '13 and his chief lieutenant, Prescott Bush '17, grandf ather of the current president, whom, as a child in 1950s, I remembered as a respected Rep ublican senator from my home state of Connecticut. [See Appendix II, to be put online]. Identified by name on one of these orders were Pres cott Bush, and another Bonesman, Roland Harriman '17, Averell's younger brother. Sinc e the early 1920's, the four Harri- man firms had raised millions from American investo rs not to build up Adolph Hitler's transportation or agriculture infrastructures, but to build up Hitler's military machine. \"Dad,\" I said, \"If you spend a couple days on the I nternet, you may get the feeling that the United States is run by a group of Ivy Lea gue arms merchants!\" In the past, an incendiary assertion like this — and had I made one or two over the years — would have triggered a soothing, quietistic \"yes, but\" respons e. But not now. I paused. We looked at each other. He seemed sad. \" Dad, are you sure you want me to go on with all this?\" I asked him, laughing as I spoke, \"This ain't fun, and, believe me, it only gets worse!\" He smiled affectionately a nd nodded yes. This was one of our moments. We were on a quest. I showed him Houston Chronicle accounts from the ear ly 1990's describing long-standing business dealings between the Bush and bin Laden fam ilies. These, I said, began in the late 1970's when Sheik Mohammed bin Laden, the family pa triarch and Osama's father, had, through a friend of the Bush family named James R. Bat h, invested $50,000 in Arbusto, the oil exploration company founded by George W. Bus h with his father's help. I added that on September 11, 2001, Shafiq bin Lade n, an estranged half-brother of Osama, had represented his family's investments at meeting of the Carlyle Group in Wash- ington, D.C. Carlyle is a $16 billion private equity firm that buys up and turns around ailing firms, especially defense contractors. George H. W. Bush serves as a Senior Consultant there. And as Dan Briody establishes in his recent book on the firm, that Fred Malek put George W. Bush on the Caterair Board from 1990-94 while Catera ir was owned by Carlyle. It was important to understand, however, that quest ionable dealings of American industrialists and politicians were by no means lim ited to the Bush family or even to the Republicans. Averell Harriman, I told my father, was a career Democrat. I passed on the observation by one of the outlaw historians that Sk ull & Bones likes to have a voice on both sides of the political debate. As it happens, Harriman's third wife, the glorious and glamorous Britisher, Pamela Har- riman, had, after his death, presided over the neo- liberal refashioning of the Democratic Party in the 1980s to the point of advancing the yo ung Bill Clinton to prominence as, of all things, the party's chief fundraiser. 54"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"R EFLECTING ON THE Y ALE S UCCESSION No arms dealings here, but plenty of Big Money. Clint on was tied to a two-party system — and to a mass media and legal system as we ll — that had kept knowledge of American business dealings with Hitler and Stalin o ut of the political mainstream. Only Big Money, it seemed, could account for this act of suppression. And Big Money had lots to hide. I told my father abo ut two well-received recent books documenting the Nazi business dealings of Hen ry Ford and James Watson of IBM. In addition, General Motors, the du Ponts and t he Rockefellers had all done business with Hitler. Finally, I mentioned Antony S utton's controversial three-volume study of the buildup of Stalin's military machine, even during the Cold War years, by American businesses assisted by the U. S. Departmen t of Commerce. Sutton was a Fel- low at Stanford University's Hoover Institute. His book, as Harvard historian Richard Pipes indicated in endorsing Sutton's findings, wou ld mark the end of Sutton's career as a mainstream academic. Recently I had discussed these dubious dealings with my co-author Bob Back, a financial analyst with a CIA background who, as it h appens, had worked during the 1970s at Brown Brothers, Harriman. \"How in hell,\" I a sked Bob in a moment of anger, \"could American industrialists arm the two dictator s who had turned the world into a living hell during much of the last half of the 20t h century?\" In response, as I told my father, Bob, himself a Bu sh Republican who sees a need for uninhib- ited dialogue on these matters, had said, \"Big money likes to play both sides of the game.\" To wrap things up, I read my father an excerpt from Joseph Trento's magisterial Secret History of the CIA. This extraordinary book is a his tory of American intelligence since World War II and, in many respects, of American for eign and domestic affairs as well. James Jesus Angleton '41, Yale's second most famous spy (the first being Nathan Hale), is a central figure in this book. Appointed by CIA f ounder Allen Dulles (a Princeton alum), Angleton was the founding Director of CIA Coun terintelligence. His job was to protect the CIA from penetration by Soviet spies. At Yale, Angleton had majored in English. My father recalled his name and said he had taught him. Angleton was a true aesthete. He cr eated and edited a poetry magazine that he hand-delivered to subscribers at all hours of the night. On a visit to Harvard, he heard a lecture by the English critic William Empso n and took it upon himself to bring Empson to lecture at Yale. Not bad for an undergrad uate, we agreed. In 1974, CIA Director William Colby dismissed Angleto n for his failed attempt to expose a Soviet mole who, Angleton was convinced, h ad totally penetrated the CIA. Angleton's obsessive witch hunt had destroyed the c areers of dozens of wrongly accused agents and demoralized the entire agency. But time confirmed his worst fears. As Trento and Da vid Wise before him have shown, CIA counterintelligence and FBI counterintelligence a s well were indeed totally com- promised by Soviet agent Igor Orlov, a \"man with th e soul of a sociopath\" yet supremely disciplined and loyal to Stalin. Angleton missed na bbing Orlov by a hairsbreadth. Under scrutiny for years — CIA and FBI agents openly visite d Gallery Orlov, the quaint art and picture-framing store that Igor and his wife Eleano re managed in Alexandria, Virginia — Orlov managed to pass two polygraph tests and got away clean. Angleton, \"written off as a crank and a madman by h is critics,\" and dying of cancer, granted Trento an interview two years before his de ath in 1987. I read my father the following excerpt: 55"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Within the confines of [Angleton's] remarkable life were most of America's secrets. \"You know how I got to be in charge of counterintel ligence? I agreed not to polygraph or require detailed background checks on Allen Dull es and 60 of his closest friends ... They were afraid that their own business dealings w ith Hitler's pals would come out. They were too arrogant to believe that the Russians would discover it all. ... You know, the CIA got tens of thousands of brave people killed . ... We played with lives as if we owned them. We gave false hope. We — I — so misjud ged what happened.\" I asked the dying man how it all went so wrong. With no emotion in his voice, but with his hand tre mbling, Angleton replied: \"Funda- mentally, the founding fathers of U.S. intelligence were liars. The better you lied and the more you betrayed, the more likely you would be pro moted. These people attracted and promoted each other. Outside of their duplicity, th e only thing they had in common was a desire for absolute power. I did things that, in looking back on my life, I regret. But I was part of it and I loved being in it... Allen Dul les, Richard Helms, Carmel Office, and Frank Wisner were the grand masters. If you were in a room with them you were in a room full of people that you had to believe would d eservedly end up in hell.\" Angleton slowly sipped his tea and then said, \"I guess I wil l see them there soon.\" I read the last paragraph aloud twice. Then I pause d. He was still with me. Shifting gears, I asked; \"Who can tell for sure whether Dull es and his pals were liars? But Angleton sure doesn't sound like a madman.\" I then tried to restore balance by suggesting that the world is a dangerous place, pure and simple. To read academics, journalists and publ ic servants like George Kennan, Ar- naud de Borchgrave, William Kristol, Robert Kagan, John Lewis Gaddis or Christopher Hitchens, I said, is to see that people like Allen Dulles and Averell Harriman, and the Yale succession presidents as well, have reason to believe they are addressing dangers that most Americans are too busy or afraid or uninformed to face up to. The problem is, I told him, that the nation lacks a mechanism — public forums — for distinguishing between dangers real and unreal. Sin ce the advent of network television, I said, civic discourse in America has degenerated to partisan strife. It's always been this way, the historians tell us, and this backward-look ing argument has great force. Yet America needs to look forward. It has the fines t communications technologies ever devised. It should have a public communications sys tem — a civic media — that brings out the best in citizens, not the worst. A problem- solving media, operating year round and prime time at local, state and national levels, that makes citizens and government responsive and accountable to each other. With this, I had spoken my piece. The sunlight was gone from the dining area. Yet my father's watery eyes were still on me. He knew all about civ ic media, a concern of mine over the past 25 years. After a moment, sensing that I was waiting f or him to speak, he lowered his eyes. He had to be tired, I thought, and indeed, at that moment, he looked to be the oldest man I'd seen outside of a wheelchair or a hospital bed. A little puddle of drool flowing from his open mouth had formed on the glass top tab le beneath his chin. But the slight forward lean in his posture told me that his mind w as working. \"So\" he said, \"What do you want to do with all this ?\" \"I want to write a book,\" I said. \"An election year book. One that gives Yale, and the nation as well, a chance to reflect. And to act app ropriately. But I need a good title. What do you think should I call it?\" 56"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"R EFLECTING ON THE Y ALE S UCCESSION Another moment passed. He leaned forward. \"How abou t Yale and the Modern World?\" he asked. It was simple. Yet Olympian in its detach ment. I suddenly felt as if, it was I who was returning from Mars - and he who had been h ere all along. Our dialogue continued throughout that very hot sum mer. Wearing big old straw hats we took our twice daily walks, measured now not in miles covered, as in days gone by, but in houses passed. We dined alfresco at a Mexica n restaurant on Waukegan Road overlooking a parking lot. A little fountain there sent water six feet into the air and brought out the best in children. At twilight on June 20, my 62nd birthday, four gene rations of Sewalls - my father and I, my nephew Ethan ('00), and my four year old son, Joseph Richard Sewall — took to a big open field near our house and threw Frisbe es. During that summer I gave my father baths and backr ubs. I played him \"Open My Eyes That I May See\", a favorite hymn. This, and so ngs by Paul Robeson — \"Jacob's Lad- der\" and \"Old Man River\" — moved him to tears. And a t several memorable gatherings, some of his former Yale students found that Richard Sewall himself could still perform, still make a telling point, even to point of moving others to tears.

Americans, ofte n characterized as optimistic, naive, and idealistic, might be mome ntarily put off by- such an assertion, but a bit of thought and observa tion will confirm the ubiquity of secrecy in American public and priv ate life. The federal government's love affair with secrecy i s well known and generally acknowledged in the fields of national security and police work. In the special- ized fields of taxation, commerce, social programs, education, transportation, medicine, and perhaps all government activity, loca l, state, and national, secrecy exists officially and unofficially. The law requires certain information — personnel re cords, personal informa- tion about citizens, plans for land purchases (lest speculators be advantaged and public costs increased), grand jury records, etc., be held tightly secret. Government imposes secrecy on citizens as it does o n its bureaucrats. The law requires some settlements in legal disputes be held confidential, and it prohib- its some information about minors being made public . Libel and slander laws prohibit some known facts about persons being publi shed or pronounced; thus, the law requires secrecy. Corporate officers may not give out financial infor mation to advantage some market players over other market players. Corporati ons, in keeping with the requirements of capitalist competition, have govern ment- protected secrecy over rheir internal financial, marketing, and technologi cal matters. Lawyer-client rela- tions and doctor-patient relations are protected. I n ordinary personal relations, everyone knows secrets, keeps some, and passes some on, at least occasionally. Surely, most people keep financial and sexual matte rs secret. 59 S"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWEREUL S ECRET S OCIETY The Constitution enshrines secrecy. Article I, Sec. 5, requires the Congress to publish its proceedings, that is, tell its secrets, except that by a majority vote in either house, it may keep some secrets. But by a tw enty percent vote, a minority may cause any secret to be printed in the Congressi onal Record. Article VI requires that no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States; that is, religious i dentity remains a secret for all in government, unless they should desire otherwise. The government's desire for secrecy — a universal p henomena, according to German sociologist, Max Weber: \"Every bureaucracy s eeks to increase the supe- riority of the professionally informed by keeping t heir knowledge and intentions secret,\" has been in constant conflict with the Fir st Amendment. President Nixon's request for an injunction against the New York Time s for intending to publish the Pentagon Papers was struck down by the Supreme Cour t, even though, according to Nixon, national security and the Vietnam War eff ort were in danger from the publication. The Court, citing the First Amendment, has quite consistently held that government entities may not suppress speech or publishing, even in severe circumstances, unless there is a strong \"clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent\" (Schenck v. United States, 1919). The Fourth Amendment is specifically aimed at prote cting the rights of citi- zens to have and keep secrets from the government. \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated . . . \" B ut the Court has had much difficulty in regulating the details; the requireme nts of effective police work run counter to an absolute requirement that a warrant b e procured for a search. The police may need to search a person, on the person's apprehension, to protect the officer's safety and to prevent any relevant eviden ce being destroyed, for instance. What to do about phone taps of known criminals? The ir acquaintances? How extensive may be a search for evidence of a person' s car, home, or business at the moment of his arrest? If, in the search for evi dence of a crime, evidence of another crime is found, but the warrant was issued for only the first crime, what evidence may be presented to a jury? How broad the rights to citizens' secrecy under the Fourth Amendment is the result of many Su preme Court cases, and changes often. The Fifth Amendment's prohibition against a person charged with a criminal offense being forced to be a witness against his or her own self is based on the notion that there needs be a balance of respect bet ween the citizen (or person) and the government; the government, at least in a d emocracy, must accord dignity and integrity to its subjects. Obviously, that woul d not be evident if the govern- ment were able to torture or intimidate a confessio n out of a person. Criminal law enforcement is more reliable and stronger when based on independently acquired evidence. Furthermore, as Justice Brandeis stated in Olmstead v. United States (1928), in a dissenting opinion, 60"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"S ECRECY AND O UR C ONSTITUTION : W HOM D O THEY S ERVE ? Decency, security and liberty alike demand that gov ernment officials shall be subjected to the same rules of conduct that are com mands to the citizens. In a government of laws, existence of the government wil l be imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime is contagious. If the Government becomes a la wbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy. To declare that in the administration of t he criminal law the end justifies the means ... would bring terrible retribution. Aga inst that pernicious doctrine this Court should resolutely set its face. Thus, Miranda rights. But, on the other side, and i n order to facilitate \"good faith\" conduct by officers, a citizen may not keep secret his identity when apprehended by an officer, according to the Supreme Court. Amendment VI requires that the accused shall \"have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.\" In other words, a person may not keep secret exculpatory evidence, if ordered by a court to prov ide it in a criminal case. The fact that a witness is required to take an oath to tell the truth, sanctioned by the criminal offense of contempt of court, means that witnesses for one side in a trial may be forced, by cross-examination, to divulge evidence t hat favors the other side. A detailed list of secret activities and secrecy im positions — by and on gov- ernment and by and on citizens could fill this and several other books! So if secrecy is as American as apple pie, and as common as apple pie, it must have a function. It does; it functions as an integral as pect of all politics, or, at least, the politics practiced by less than perfect persons in less than perfect societ- ies, i.e., all societies. (One might hypothesize a Utopian situation in which all relationships were transparent and overt, thus need ing no secrecy). But in the real world of human relations, politics requires — and would be impossible without secrecy. These assertions won't stand witho ut explanation, nor would they be relevant to the subject of secrecy without an explanation based upon an uncommon definition of politics. P OLITICS , I N T HEORY ROFESSIONAL POLITICAL SCIENTISTS have had a bit of a problem with their central term. In the attempt to present themselves as scientists, they have, historically (if not hysterically) sought a definit ion of politics that would be acceptable and understandable to all. It would sure ly be a great achievement on the road to scientific acceptance if such a definit ion could be formulated. One must give the discipline credit for effort, if not for achievement; thousands of definitions exist. As it is, in recognition of the absence of a commonly accepted definition of politics, the discipline has agreed t o disagree; every political scientist is free to create his own, on the convenient assump tion that any agreed upon definition would inhibit free enquiry and cause a s traitjacket mentality. 61 P"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Recall President Bill Clinton's comment in his defe nse to the charge of inap- propriate behavior in the Oval Office: \"It all depe nds on what the meaning of is is.\" Ever the consummate politician, he was exac tly right in noting that the definition is the crux of all matters. Likewise, fo r politics, which is not what you learned in PS 101 — constitutions, legislatures, el ections, etc., all of which are but the idiosyncratic formal, organizational, and somew hat regularized, but ephem- eral, expression of politics in the hundred plus na tions of the world. While such knowledge is necessary and useful for partial under standing of formal governmen- tal and political structures and machinations, one doesn't build a science on such ephemera; it would be like trying to develop a theo ry of botany by studying only the roses of the world, but only those roses found organized in formal gardens, or to develop a theory of biology by studying only aardvarks. A scientifically adequate definition of politics wo uld require that it be presented in terms of behavior known and practiced by all hum ans. As it is, most people know and care more about licorice than legislation, like elephants more than elections, and worry about constipation more than constitution s. The existing multitude of definitions of politics is the product of academici ans and practitioners fascinated by those who hold the reins of public power. Their definitions might be useful and partially valid within the confines of that notable sphere of activity, but one should not confuse, say, a definition of water, adequate t o discuss flood control, with a scientific definition of water at the level of its constituent elements of hydrogen and oxygen or, even at the lower level of its atomic st ructure. The social cost of defin- ing politics in terms of governmental power was nic ely noted by David Ignatius of the Washington Post who wrote, \"When the big guy s in Washington dream of transforming the world, it's the little guys who co me home in body bags.\" Politics, to be studied as a science, must first be defined as the universal form of human behavior that it is! Every human expresses politics throughout his or her life, just as all individuals expresses psychol ogical, sociological, economic, and biological realities every day of their lives, and the psychologists, sociologists, economists, and biologist can speak to their cohort s sensibly because they have common understanding of their basic terms. Not so, political scientists. But who can doubt that politics is a universal phen omenon not restricted to only those who govern, seek to govern, or seek to i nfluence those who govern. There is a fundamental parallel between the behavio r of Winston Churchill in defining the situation of England in 1940 as dire a nd seeking to convince Franklin Roosevelt to send guns and butter to England, and t he behavior of a baby in the middle of the night. Thus, for example, the plainti ve cry of the baby, at 3:00 AM, is a political act — defining its situation as hungry, wet, and/or lonesome. The baby's definition of the situation will be rein terpreted by the father, who will define it to his advantage; he will fake a few snor es. His wife, acting politically in her own interests, using her elbow, will reject the father's definition and substitute one of her own: \"You're faking, John! You know it's your turn! Get up and warm the bottle!\" Now, that's politics at its universal human level. 62"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"S ECRECY AND O UR C ONSTITUTION -. W HOM D O THEY S ERVE ? By contrast, the definitions of the subject in the writings of major political science authorities are narrow and idiomatic. Twent y experts: twenty definitions. There is a British book, What is Politics?, in whic h each authority presents a differ- ent definition of the subject. One pundit will defi ne politics as influence, another as power, another as self-interest, another as the art of the possible, and another as the skill of building consensus around a policy option. One expert, writing on the power of the presidency, determined that pol itical power is the power to persuade. That's close, but he made the mistake of confusing means and results. Thus, all he had was a tautology, asking, then, wha t is the power to persuade? If, instead, he had concentrated on means, on behavior, he would have found that persuasive behavior (politics in a generic sense) i s the effective skill of creating self -serving definitions of reality. Politics is the un iversal human behavior of defining reality so as to bring about acceptance of one's de sired outcome. Here are examples that prove the point: \"Johnny, st op hitting your sister; be a good boy.\" \"If you really loved me, you'd buy me th at necklace.\" \"Good friends don't let each other drink and drive.\" \"Owning one' s personal weapon is a sacred American right.\" \"Dan Quayle is no Jack Kennedy!\" \" Osama bin Laden has insulted and degraded the Moslem faith.\" Accept any of these quotes, and you have accepted the speaker's definition of reality a nd his or her politics. With this definition of politics, politics as a uni versal human goal-fulfilling behavior, consider the element of secrecy in the fo llowing example from Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn. Huck finds himself in a r eal jam and has to come up quickly with an effective definition of the situati on! He and the runaway slave, Jim, are on the raft, floating down the Mississippi , when a boat comes along side. In it are two fellows with guns, and they are looking for an escaped slave. Huck has hurried Jim under their tent to hide benea th some blankets. The con- versation is pure Twain: The men ask if Huck has se en the slave, and he assures them that he has not, but if he had, he would surel y turn him in. The men are somewhat convinced, but just to be sure, they say t hat they will come aboard and look around the raft. Huck is feeling \"scared as a rabbit,\" but he just u p and says that, yes, you bet- ter come aboard, but don't get too close to my dadd y in the tent, cause he has 'the sickness.' And nobody will let me land and tak e care of him. What do you say, 'Boy'? Your pappy has the plague? All ends wel l, with the men each putting a five-dollar gold piece on a shovel blade and, mak ing sure not to get too close, poking the gold over to Huck, 'cause he's sure in a poor way!' Huck, the master politician, defining the situation to his advantage , by keeping the reality secret in order to manipulate his competitors into accepti ng his contrived redefinition of that reality. Another example of how politics is an expression of different perspectives of reality is shown in four differing definitions of t he little town of Denton, Texas, (where I taught in the late 60s). A huge billboard on Interstate 35 claimed that Denton was \"just like Los Angeles, give or take six million people.\" Some of the 63"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY local rednecks had crossed out \"people\" and painted in \"Niggers!\" Other citizens (I suspect some of my ACLU friends) had crossed out that obscenity and written in \"Racist Trash!\" But that had been crossed out by some of the local feminists, who had scrawled, \"Male Chauvinist Pigs!\" For obvio us reasons, the authors of these insights chose to keep their identities secre t. Religion is essentially a subset of politics, the e laborate creation of a particular definition of life and eternity which is then offer ed to or imposed upon members and others. In requiring unquestioning acceptance, religions practice considerable secrecy. They exhibit much of the same behavior as governmental agencies that become convinced of their role as protector of the nation's security. Those agencies, such as the CIA and the FBI, approach totalitarian means of secrecy (on which, more later) to carry out what, to them, comes close to being considered a divine mission. Religions create absolute definitions of r eality. There is no argument, in that context. (As a friend once said in response to one of my more arrogant pronouncements, \"I see you have a very concrete vie w of this — all mixed up and permanently set\"). Thus, some religions require mem bers to police themselves - not read certain books, not allow evolutionary th eory to contaminate their minds, not let authorities know of certain illegal practices such as polygamy, child abuse, narcotic use, etc., and violation of t his secrecy is sanctioned by the ultimate punishments: banishment, and later, eterna l hell. P OLITICS , I N P RACTICE HE MATERIAL ABOVE, in summary, says secrecy is a ne cessary and integral aspect of American life. It is required and protect ed by the Constitution, practiced by all bureaucracies and all citizens, an d is essential to politics in all its forms, formal and informal, public and private. What becomes apparent is that secrecy, like so many elements of life, is nei ther inherently 'good' nor 'bad.' Secrecy, like government, the law, the presidency, the military, the police, religion, politics, money, guns, or drugs, is a tool or devic e or resource that is to be judged according to the result of its use. Some obviously bad uses of secrecy, in terms of pub lic policy and social felicity, ironically, are quite well known, but, regardless, seem to be repeated over and over through our history. The exercise of governmen tal police power, defined as the authority to promote and safeguard the health, morals, safety, and welfare of the people, tends to enlarge the domain of governme nt, local, state, and national, over the citizen. Surely, the constant repetition of scandals wherein the local or state police have kept secret files on citizens, a practice prohibite d by law, speaks to the weakness of dedication to the principle of a government of l aw by the very bureaucracies assigned to protect it. In Portland, Oregon, twenty years ago, the ACLU succeeded in forcing the police to eliminate such a file, but in 2002, police again were found to have kept illegal files on thousands of citizens . In that same year, the Denver, Colorado, police were ordered to purge their system of spying secretly on citizens. 64 T"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"S ECRECY AND O UR C ONSTITUTION : W HOM D O THEY S ERVE ? In Denver, great-grandmother Helen Henry, 82, was n oted in the secret files as having a \"Free Leonard Peltier\" bumper sticker on h er Toyota sedan (Sunday Or- egonian, 9/15/02, p. A21)! While such absurdities m ay cause a laugh, it is a serious matter; fear of one's name being placed in a secret file may cause that citizen to give up the constitutional right to protest peacefu lly. Hearing that a neighbors name, or even an unknown citizen's name may be in a file has a chilling effect on the exercise of civil rights, the life blood of dem ocratic government. At the national level, the FBI under Director J. Ed gar Hoover was found to have maintained extensive secret files on the rich, the famous, and the politi- cally active. Hoover's long tenure was often attrib uted to the belief that he held embarrassing evidence on even the presidents and ot her top leaders, thus no president dared to fire him. In response to the 9/11/01 terrorist attack on the nation, local police have been asked to work with the FBI-led Joint Terrorism Task Force. Many civil libertarians are troubled by the implicit conflict between the n eed to fight terrorist threats and the quite probable partial misuse of the police power. This fear is augmented by the creation of the Department of Homeland Secur ity and the aggressive use of secrecy by Attorney General of the United States , John Ashcroft. The AG's office has adopted a blanket policy to clo se hundreds of deportation hearings of noncitizens suspected of connection to terrorist activity. In August of 2002, a unanimous three-judge panel of the Sixth United States Court of Appeals declared that unlawful. Said Judge Damon J Keith, \"Democracies die behind closed doors. When government begins closing doors, it selectively con- trols information rightfully belonging to the peopl e. Selective information is misinformation.\" It is upsetting to read constantly of the use of se crecy by national leaders. Both President Bush and Vice President Cheney have kept secret public information publicly demanded, in response to the recent corpor ate crime scandals, about their activities as CEOs of Harken Oil and Halliburton, r espectively. President Bush wants the new Homeland Security Department to be ex empt from the Freedom of Information Act and the Whistleblower Act. Dick Cheney has stonewalled the legitimate demand for the notes and list of att endees at his meetings to create a national energy policy; that \"national energy pol icy development gtoup\" was a public body that met in secret. Even diehard Repu blican conservatives such as Senator Dan Burton of Indiana, who fear big and intrusive government, are aghast at a White House so hostile to open governme nt. The high cost of misused secrecy was made evident o n September 11, 2001. It has become all too clear, in the public hearings in October, 2002, of the joint intelligence committee's investigating the attacks that the FBI, the CIA and the NSA had failed to protect the nation from calamity because of inefficiency tied to the overuse of secrecy. The agencies failed to c ommunicate with each other, protecting bureaucratic turf rather than American s oil.

Hayden, 65"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY and CIA Director George Tenet all spoke at length a nd provided many excuses, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, a member of the Sen ate Select Committee on Intelligence, said, \"At crucial points in the 21 mo nths leading up to September 11th, this intelligence information was not shared or was not acted upon and, as a result, numerous opportunities to thwart the terr orist plots were squandered.\" (The Oregonian, October 18, 2002, p. A2) As tragic as the incompetence leading up to 9/11 ha s been, an even more pervasive example of incompetent management of a go vernmental responsibil- ity is reported by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan in his book, Secrecy (Yale University Press, 1998). The extreme politics between the Right and the Left in America, in the period leading up to World War II and after, were based on allegations of secret con- spiracies. The Right was sure that the Left was ali gned with world communism, that Pearl Harbor was the result of a secret plan t o bring the US into the war to save Stalin and Russia, and that the Communist Inte rnational had spies in all the sensitive areas of government. The Left, citing the Red Scare raids of the 1920s, pictured the Right as a group of fascists led by J. Edgar Hoover who wanted to de stroy the legal protections of the Constitution, turn America over to Hitler, and was secretly involved in munitions and other manufacturing in Germany. Senator Joseph McCarthy astounded the Senate with the news that General George C. Marshal l was a Communist traitor at the center of \"a conspiracy so immense\" as to dw arf any in history. McCarthy, it is now clear, would have been nothing without go vernment secrecy. His ability to hypnotize the nation over the radio and the then -new television screen was based upon his claim that all his evidence came fro m secret documents held by the executive branch, which was dominated by commun ists. Within this environment, says Moynihan, bazaar surr eal events transpired. Hoover wrote an amazing letter to George E. Allen, Director of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, intending that it would then b e seen by President Truman (Hoover apparently could not bring himself to write directly to the President whom he personally detested). The letter outlined a huge conspiracy of top gov- ernment officials working for a communist victory o ver America: Dean Acheson, Secretary of State; John J. McCloy, Former Assistan t Secretary of War; Henry A. Wallace, Secretary of Commerce; Alger Hiss of the U N Organization; Dr. Edward U. Condon, Advisor to the Congressional Committee o n Atomic Energy; popular journalists Raymond Gram Swing and Marquis Childs, and others. The message, six pages long, outlined Hoover's conclusions, from evidence by an 'informer,' that the secrets of the American atomic bomb were b eing funneled through these people directly to the Soviets! Moynihan characteri zes it as a loony message not taken seriously. But what about its inclusion of th e name, Alger Hiss!? That was 1946. In 1949, after the very fortuitous b reaking of the Soviet code by which the USSR was communicating with its agents in America, it was found that there was, in fact, an effective Soviet espion age effort in America. This in- 66"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"S ECRECY AND O UR C ONSTITUTION : W HOM D O THEY S ERVE ? formation was in the hands of the forerunner agency of the current NSA, and its head, Admiral Stone, determined that President Truman should be informed immediately. However, General Carter W. Clarke, the n chief of the army security agency, strongly disagreed; if the information were spread around, surely there would be a leak, and the Russians would know their code had been broken. At that point, General Omar Nelson Bradley, chairman o f the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in spite of his admiration and loyalty to the Presi dent, agreed with General Clarke that the fact should be kept secret from the Presid ent and from Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, the first director of the CIA! Se crecy triumphed! President Truman was subjected to the very heated a buse of the McCarthy period and was required to defend his administratio n from some wild and base- less charges as well as other valid charges that we re not supported by known evidence. Whittaker Chambers was right about Alger Hiss. But Truman was not allowed to know the fact that the Soviet code h ad been broken, the extent of the communist espionage ring's success, and the truth about Alger Hiss. The president of the United States was kept in the dark on a most important matter of national security because of the secrecy demands of underlings. The Venona files (the name applied to the deciphered Soviet sp y messages) only became public knowledge decades later through the efforts of Moyn ihan and the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy, in 1 996. If, as the Constitu- tion requires, civilian leadership is centered in a civilian president who dominates the military service, and if Truman had been inform ed of the Venona files, how different would have been his handling of the commu nists-in-government issue that plagued his tenure as President, and how less would have been the trauma of national politics through the late forties and t he fifties? But the battle continues even into this century. Ri chard Perle, reviewing Moynihan's book in Commentary (www.findarticles.com /ct), barely concealing his conservative stiletto, writes: Curiously, Moynihan, a former vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Com- mittee, does not pause to wonder whether Washington might have had good reason to conceal its success in deciphering the So viet codes. Although one would like to know what lies behind his thinking here, he never tells us. Nor do we learn anything more about his breathtaking revelati on that even President Truman was kept in the dark about the decryptions. Can thi s be true? Or is there some metasecret of which Moynihan, too, remains ignorant ? (My emphasis) Apparently, \"Washington,\" for Perle, means the CIA, the FBI, and the Military Joint Chiefs of Staff, rather than the democratic s tructures of the government — the Congress and the Office of the President. He is quick to conjure up a conspiracy theory, in loyalty to his preferred powe rs. And surely, the seventies and eighties would have g one down differently if the CIA and the NSA had been less secret. The nation kn ows now that there was gross incompetence in those agencies in their effor ts to evaluate the Soviet Union 67"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY through the years of the Cold War. Soviet strengths were greatly exaggerated, and the weaknesses of the system were ignored. Only a f ew, Moynihan included, saw the errors in the analysis in the projections of So viet power. Even Richard Perle accepts Moynihan's evaluation on this point. There can be no doubt that the CIA seriously and co nsistently over-estimated the size, rate of growth, and potential of the Sovi et economy. In 1958, the agency took the view that Soviet gross domestic product (G DP) was growing much faster than ours, and would come within 50 percent of ours by 1962. This was ludicrous, as was the CIA estimate in 1990 that the Soviet GDP stood at $2.5 trillion. ... As Moynihan rightly observes, any cas ual visitor to Moscow would have seen more than enough of the appalling circums tances in which most Soviet citizens lived to cast doubt on the plausibility of the CIA's view. The CIA soon after its creation at the end of World War II came to exhibit all the earmarks of a usual regulatory bureaucracy - and some quite unusual characteristics: in 1997, the first public statemen t of its budget was made, and it was $26.6 billion! But regardless of its more th an fifty years of existence, its huge secret budget, its ability to exist out of the public eye, and amazing tech- nological developments (communications, U-2s, satel lites, and computers), \"the overall quality of American intelligence may well h ave declined over time,\" says Moynihan (p. 78). Surely, the most telling evidence of the CIA's inco mpetence was in its main task, evaluation of the 'enemy,' the USSR. It conti nually pictured the Soviet Union as a strong, modern, industrial behemoth sing le-mindedly pursuing the goal of world domination and equipped with a nuclea r age armed force. The reality had not been spotted in the decades of U-2 and satellite photos or in the reams of secret documents. The USSR's incompetence in Afghanistan and the final collapse of the wall were surprises to those who should have known. Stanford Turner, the director of the CIA from 1977 to 1981, in 1991, claimed never to have heard from the intelligence or defense or stat e establishment even a hint that non-official sources in the Soviet Union were convinced that the system was broken and would disintegrate from its own internal weaknesses. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's conclusion is that, at le ast in part, the reason is that collected information was kept secret, analyses wer e kept secret, and conclusions were kept secret; if these had been allowed to be k nown, discussed, criticized, and argued, errors, inconsistencies, and illogical aspe cts could have been eliminated. The price paid for the luxury of secrecy was stagge ring. What if, Moynihan asks, the US had been less secret, less bellicose, more c onservative in its financing of military might, and had been prepared, when the ine vitable collapse of the USSR came, to offer a parallel to the Marshall Plan that produced a renewed Europe and a friendly Germany and Italy?

The policy making and enacting instit utions of government, the legislative and executive branches, are overwhelmin gly the sites of lobbying, a secret process in which the agents of private inter ests, in league with the majority of elected and appointed officials, work against th e public interests. The political aim of the lobbyists is to convince l egislators and bureaucrats to accept a definition of reality favorable to the lobbyists, but to clothe that definition, which is kept secret, behind a definiti on of the reality that appears to be in the public interest. For example, lumber c ompanies want to log state and national forest lands. They define their desire to see public money spent on roads throughout the forest as a desire to enhance the protection of the forest in case of forest fires, and to enhance the access to the public for hunting and camping activity. Likewise, the pharmaceutical industry lobbies for e xtension of patent rights on profitable drugs \"in order to ensure that they have enough money for their very important research in the war against devastating c rippling diseases;\" yet, most of their money goes for advertising, and most of th eir research money goes to invent drugs to fight the common cold, hemorrhoids, backache and zits. \"Why? As Willy Sutton said, \"That's where the money is.\" Countless other examples may be found in the alphabet of economic activity i n America from agriculture, banking, and commerce through X-rays, yacht ownersh ip, and zinc mining. Politicians, of course, enter into these conspiraci es eagerly so as to collect cam- paign funds and to win a block of voters whose inte rests are enhanced. Addition- ally, coming to light all too often in scandals are the cases of officials accepting bribes or presents or paid trips, with family, to e xotic spots to attend \"important policy discussions\" held quite often on golf course s. Many, even perhaps most, politicians develop great skill in presenting thems elves as selfless agents working tor the public weal, while secretly more concerned with job security and career goals in the struggle for power. That's politics! T HE P OLITICS O F S ECRET C ONSPIRACIES ECRECY, IN AN IMPERFECT WORLD, is an essential aspe ct of all politics. And, as noted above, the process of politics is the crea tion of self-serving definitions of reality. Secrecy, obviously, rests upon an assum ption of mistrust in one's target of politics. Democrats mistrust Republicans, and vi ce versa. Nations mistrust each other. Husbands and wives mistrust each other, keeping their affairs secret, knowing their spouses just wouldn't understand. Lik ewise between parents and children. Thus, politicians define the reality of t heir ambitions in terms of service to the public good, nations talk peace but prepare for war, spouses define absence as the necessity of working late at the office, and children, intending to party, claim the need to get help on homework from a class mate. James Madison, in THE FEDERALIST PAPERS, \"Number X, \" describes the essential elements in a republic to be freedom to f orm factions, the necessity that mere be many factions, that they be spread over a l arge area, and that they be 69 S"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY composed of a large number of individuals. Minority factions are controllable by the votes of a majority faction. But majority facti ons present the danger of deprival of rights of individuals and minorities. This dange r, however, can be minimized by the difficulties of majorities to act in unison. First, they are, themselves, composed of minorities and, thus, find it hard to o rganize in concert to oppress a particular minority. And the fact that they are c omposed of many individuals spread over a large area also reduces their ability to act efficiently. Half of what anyone needs to know to understand American politic s can be found in these insights presented by Madison in the five or six pa ges of Number X! But the politics of conspiracies is not explained b y the theory of democracy. Certainly, conspiracies are factions, and they are minority factions, but the defense Madison proposes, a majority vote, does not apply, because conspiracies see all non-members as opponents, and their secrecy aims to prevent opponents from even knowing of their existence, let alone offering themselves up for a vote by the citizens. This is true for the corporation cliq ue that conspires to defraud the public or its own stockholders, for criminals plann ing a bank heist, for a politi- cal conspiracy planning a coup de etat, or a cabal of bureaucratic insiders intent upon using government power for personal and/or pol itical purposes. All secret societies are conspiratorial factions ai med at achieving goals that, by definition, are contrary to the public interest as determined by citizens in an open society. As Madison says, no faction can be allowed to be a judge in its own cause, because its interests would certainly bias its judg ment and corrupt its integrity. And, as Karl Popper says, freedom is impossible unl ess it is guaranteed by the state; any secret society that weakens the rule of law, creates inequalities among citizens by illegal means, or frustrates the legiti mate aims of democratic policy weakens a democratic republic and its objective of guaranteeing freedom to its citizens. Logically, then, secret societies are thr eats to democratic societies. The question becomes one of determining how serious a threat to a democracy is a particular secret society. Certainly, Al-Queda is a very threatening conspiracy, as was the conspiracy led by Timothy McVeigh, and a s is the mailer of the anthrax germs. One may create his or her own hierarchy of s ecret conspiracies threatening our society. The list is too long for this article, but would include some of these: all criminal activists, violent Right-to-Life facti ons, pedophilia traffickers, violent white-power advocates, anti-tax groups that practic e fraud, illegal pornographers, a multitude of scam artists operating just within t he law, the Elmer Gantrys of religious exploitation, gangs that use violence and intimidation, etc., etc. Lastly, if I could be allowed a personal expression based on normative values rather than hard facts or academically sound theory , the conspiracies listed in the previous paragraph (other than the first three) are comparatively 'small potatoes' based on marginal personal greed or ego or fanatici sm not reaching the level of serious threats to American democracy. They are the inevitable garbage created in a society that values liberty over totalitarian ord er.

NTONY C. SUTTON, F EB . 14, 1925 - JUNE 17, 2002, has been persecuted but never prosecuted for his research and subsequen t publishing of his findings. His mainstream career was shattered by hi s devotion towards uncovering the truth. In 1968, his Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development was published by The Hoover Institute at Stanford University. Sutton showed how the Soviet state's technological and manufacturing base, which was then engaged in supplying the North Vietnamese the armaments and supplies to kill and wound American soldiers, was built by US firms and mostly paid for by the US taxpayers. From their largest steel and iron pla nt, to automobile manufacturing equipment, to precision ba ll-bearings and computers, the majority of the Soviet's large industrial enter prises had been built with the United States help or technical assistance. Professor Richard Pipes, of Harvard, said in his bo ok, Survival Is Not Enough: Soviet Realities and America's Future (Simon & Schu ster; 1984): \"In his three-volume detailed account of Soviet Pur chases of Western Equip- ment and Technology ... [Antony] Sutton comes to co nclusions that are uncom- fortable for many businessmen and economists. For t his reason his work tends to be either dismissed out of hand as extreme or, more often, simply ignored.\" The reportage was too much and Sutton's career as a well-paid member of the aca- demic establishment was under attack and he was tol d that he \"would not survive.\" His work led him to more questions than answers. \"W hy had the US built- up it's enemy? Why did the US build-up the Soviet U nion, while we also transferred technology to Hitler's Germany? Why doe s Washington want to conceal these facts?\" Sutton, following his leads, proceeded to research and write his outstanding Wall Street financial expose series Wall Street and FDR; Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler, and Wall Street and The Bolshevik Revolu tion. Then, someone sent Antony a membership list of Skul l & Bones and ... \"a picture jumped out.\" And what a picture! A multigen erational foreign-based secret society with fingers in all kinds of pies an d roots going back to Illuminati influences in 1830's Germany. And what a list of members, accomplishments and ... skullduggery! Here, in a rare interview by email, are Antony Sutt on's own reflections and answers to questions from myself and other research ers: EMEMBER, ALL MY PAPERS on this are in deep storage 1000 miles away and cannot be accessed and I've not even thought about S&B for 15 years.

I know the book is a steady seller from the royalty reports; but that is all. For the last 10 years I have been in complete seclu sion working on future technology ... I'm more engineer than historian. Th e only visitors I've had or meetings have been with three-letter agency people, who arrive on the doorstep unannounced and complain I am hard to find. Big Bro ther has the ability ap- parently to find anyone. Nothing mysterious about this, I just dislike publi city and social interaction. You will see from the Dutch TV episode that my work still upsets the powers- that-be so these are merely reasonable precautions. T HE I NTERVIEW KM - Can you tell the story of how you learned abou t Skull 8c Bones, and how you felt? AS - I knew nothing of S&B until I received a lette r in the early 80's asking if I would like to look at a genuine membership list. For no real reason I said yes. It was agreed to send the package by Federal Expres s and I could keep it for 24 hours, it had to be returned to the safe. It was a \"black bag\" job by a family member disgusted with their activities. For the benefit of any S&B members who may read and doubt the statement; the membership list is in two volumes, black leathe r bound. Living members and deceased members in separate volumes. Very hand some books. I spent all night in Kinko's, Santa Cruz, copied th e entire volumes and re- turned within the 24 hour period. I have never released any copies or identified the source. I figured each copy could be coded and enable S&B to trace the leak. How did I feel? I felt then (as I do now} that thes e \"prominent\" men are really immature juveniles at heart. The horribl e reality is that these little boys have been dominant in their influence in world affairs. No wonder we have wars and violence. Skull & Bones is the symbol of terrorist violence, pirates, the SS Deaths Head Division in WW Two, lab els on poison bottles and so on. I kept the stack of xeroxed sheets for quite a whil e before I looked at them— when I did look—a picture jumped out, THIS was a si gnificant part of the so called establishment. No wonder the world has probl ems! KM - What is the percentage of active members? AS - I haven't checked for 15 years ... it used to be about one quarter. With the rise of the Bush dynasty it will increase somew hat, as they climb on the bandwagon. The Demos had their turn with Harriman i n the 40's and 50's. KM - How many active members are there? AS - Usually about 600 alive at any one time ... re cently more active. 75"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY KM - What is your take on the grandfather clock that each member allegedly receives? AS - They do get a clock. I've had that confirmed and you will see it in the photos in ASE (America's Secret Establish- ment). Might be symbolic, per- haps to state their organization goes on tunelessly. KM - Has Skull and Bones lost its clout? AS - Well look at the recent fund-raiser for George Bush ... Republicans are stuffing money into his pockets ... I suggest members recently got behind one of their own and decided to push Geo rge all out for president ... and Democrats can't do a thing because Democrat Bones are not going to allow the Party to use the ultimate weapon ... Geor ge's membership in a foreign secret society. KM - What do you know of George W Bush? AS - He is a third generation Bonesman. My personal impression is that he doesn't have the drive of his father or the skills of his grandfather ... but I could be very wrong. He can beat anyone hands down — EXCE PT VENTURA. If Bush handlers allow a face to face debate betwee n Bush and Ventura. Ventura will win. Remember Ventura has admitted to his so-called \"sins.\" Bush has a closet-full waiting to emerge. People are get ting bored with cover ups and spin. 2000 may see the end of the Bones influence or — re ality that these Bones people are powerful. KM - Is the name of the German group known? AS - Almost certainly Illuminati. KM - Some people say that there are other cells; wh at do you think? AS - There are many other secret societies. I've on ly looked at S&B. Unfortu- nately no historian will keep his job if he tries t o explore conspiracy ... this is taboo for the American Historical Association. Soon er or later outsiders will take a look. I've long thought that S&B fits the le gal definition of a conspiracy and needs to be officially investigated. Yes there should be other cells. No secret society worth anything is going to keep its inner actions written down on paper. If th e gigantic electronic monitor- 76 "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"W, S&B - AND THE TRUTH SHALL SET US FREE ing apparatus is for national security purposes, th en it should be monitoring these people 24 hours a day. KM - What are your thoughts on WolFs Head? Scroll & Key? And the other Senior societies at Yale? AS - Wolfs Head, Scroll and Key seem to be pale imi tations of S&B, but they have the same objective of deliberately building di scrimination into a society. I listened to Jesse Ventura last night and he made th e point that the Founding Fathers intended for CITIZENS to represent the people. I ag ree; a trucker, a farmer, a teacher represent the people not a bunch of profess ional pols or a secret society like S&B. All these societies place their own membe rs ahead of the pack and give preference to their own members; this is discrimina tion par excellence. KM - Have you read Cathy O'Brien's book Tranceforma tion Of America? What do think of it? AS - The book does not contain one piece of hard ph ysical evidence.. I think Cathy O'Brien BELIEVES SHE IS TELLING THE TRUTH ... but remember that Mark Phillips is a skilled neuro-linguistic-pr ogrammer. Another point that really concerns me is this ... w here did this story origi- nate? It originated in Communist Chinese Intelligen ce and Mark Phillips had a contractual relationship with the ChiComs. This c ould be an attempt to destabilize the US. No doubt these Washington pols are fully capable of these weird practices, lust look at Bohemian Grove but that doesn't mean t hat the book is an accurate portrayal. If the book is credible, I would think t he police would have raided Bohemian Grove long ago My best guess is that the Chinese picked up whisper s of Washington scandals and blew them out of proportion for their own purpo ses. This is a GUESS ... I don't know. One thing that puzzled me, with all these sexual sh enanigans how do Wash- ington politicians find time to do anything else? A ccording to the book this is a full time occupation for Senator Byrd and others. KM - What did your study of elites, economics, secr ecy and technology do tor your career? AS - Depends what you mean by career? By conventional standards I am an abject failure. I 've been thrown out of two major Universities (UCLA and Stanford), denied tenure at Cal State Los Angeles. Every time I write something, it appears t o offend someone in the Establishment and they throw me to the wolves.

William Buckley ca lled me a \"jerk.\" Glenn Campbell, former Director of the Hoover Institution, Stanford called me \"a problem.\" KM - Do you believe that there has been suppression of technology? Has it been major or minor? AS - Yes there has been suppression but its going t o be impossible to suppress the new emerging paradigm. KM - The Federal Reserve, the House of Morgan, Hous e of Rothschild and Skull and Bones are they related? AS - Best source for this is my book The Federal Re serve Conspiracy. KM - What are the good source materials for your re search and writings about Skull and Bone's influencing John Dewey and Horace Mann? AS - Depends what you want to find. You could explo re the 10 or so volume works of Dewey ... outrageous Hegelianism, the stat e is supreme, the individual merely a pawn to be trained. This is the basis of o ur 'educational system\" ...or you could go and explore the members of S&B who brought the system to the US. This trained \"sausage mind\" outlook has thoroughly permeated our universi- ties ... that's why we have the peer review system ... we are all supposed to think alike and find the same answers. This political cor rectness garbage is another step to total thought control. AH - Did any of Hitler's economic policies threaten the interests of the inter- national bankers, and if so did that play a role in his downfall? AS - Hitler's economic policies were OK'd by the ba nkers right through the war ... ITT, Chase, Texaco and others were operatin g in Nazi-held France as late as 1945. In fact Chase in Paris was trying to get N azi accounts as late as 1944. When we got to Germany in May, 1945, I remember see ing a (bombed-out) Woolworth store in Hamburg and thinking, \"What's Wo olworth doing in Nazi Germany?\" While we were bombed and shelled it was \" business as usual\" for Big Business. Try the Alien Custodian Papers. See my Best Enemy Money Can Buy for more. Union Banking is very important. I made a documenta ry for Dutch National TV some years ago. It got all the way through the p roduction process to the Dutch TV Guide ... at the last minute it was pulled and another film substituted. This documentary has proof of Bush financing Hitler — documents. Maybe my Dutch friends will still get it viewed, bu t the apparatus reaches into Holland. KM - What is the story that was going to be told on Dutch TV? And what is the story of it's censorship? 78"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"W, S&B - AND THE TRUTH SHALL SET US TREE AS - Couple of years back, a Dutch TV production co mpany from Amsterdam - under contract to Dutch National TV—came to the U S to make a documen- tary on S&B. They went to the Bones Temple and othe r places and interviewed people on the East Coast. On the West Coast, they i nterviewed myself and one other person. I saw extracts from the original and it is a good p rofessional job. They had documents linking the Bush family and other S&B mem bers to financing Hitler through Union Banking of New York and its Dutch cor respondent bank. More than I have in Wall Street And The Rise Of Hitler. The first version was later upgraded into a two par t documentary and sched- uled for showing this last March. It was pulled at the last minute and has never been shown. AH - Who has been financing Milosevic, and what role has the international banking com- munity played in the Balkans? AS - I haven't looked at this one. Of course the notorious Black Hand society is located in the Balkans. See WW One. DG - What is the importance of your work on Skull and Bones? AS - The potential is extraordinary. IF we find that secret societies are indeed significant, the entire history of the last two centuries will have to be re-written. At this point in 1999, the potential has not been explored by others and I've moved back to my original interest—technology. Apparently people see some merit in the work. It is never advertised. It is an underground word of mouth distribution but has sold steadily from 1986 to dat e. Every month I get a royalty check, so I know it is selling. But my original ent husiastic statement has not been fulfilled. KM - What do you see for the future? AS - Chaos, confusion and ultimately a battle betwe en the individual and the State. The individual is the stronger; and will win. The s tate is a fiction sanctified by Hegel and his followers to CONTROL the individua l. Sooner or later people will wake up. First we have to dump the trap of right and left, this is a Hegelian trap to divide and con trol.

N TALKING TO A MAGAZINE in New York that is working on a feature story on George W. Bush and was thinking of doing a piece on S&B, I asked how about a sidebar on Antony Sutton? And got these res ponses: \"Someone is claiming he's a John Bircher. Liberty H ouse is a right wing pub- lishing company in Montana. \"Antony Sutton was at Stanford's conservative Hoove r Institute. \"Among many other claims, Sutton's book accuses Sku ll and Bones of funding and encouraging 'the Maxist/Leftist '60s re volution'... and divert- ing attention by drawing students into disarmament and/or environmental groups and issues. \"Although there seems to be some real info in his b ook, it reads like a classic text of right-wing propaganda, filled with hyperbole and unsourced allegations.\" Antony Sutton's response: What's wrong with these editors? I was thrown out of the Hoover Institution by the C IA types... I am definitely persona non-grata. Director Glenn Campbell actually threatened me \"you will not survive.\" Some right winger!!

AS - The most astonishing aspect of ASE is that the damn thing keeps selling with no advertising, no publicity, no help from me or the publisher. Astonish- ing and gratifying.

Accordi ng to published accounts June 17th, 1933, was the date of the Order of Skull & Bo ne's Century Celebration. His death was sudden and unexpected. He was 77 and the local county coroner declared his passing, natural causes. Even after repeated co ntacts and pleas, no newspaper ran an obituary or story about his death and works. Tony d ied less than three weeks after the first hardbound copies of America's Secret Establis hment were delivered from the printer. He was getting ready and was excited about appearin g on radio shows to promote the book. The book was to be in West-Coast bookstores in September. Tony's death and a national book distribution opportunity changed the limited fall 2002 release to a national 2003 spring release. Meanwhile Little & Brown moved Alexandra Robbins' book (the first ever mainstream book on Bones) up to September , 2002 from January, 2003. Her book, Secrets of the Tomb, gets placed in the histo ry section, whilst Tony's book gets placed in the speculation section with UFO's and such. Hmm , a book written by a member of the second oldest secret society at Yale, which dec lares Bones to be \"the equivalent to the Wizard of Oz,\" that sometimes \"Oz needed its Wizard \" and disposes of the Nazi financing issue in one terse sentence is declared history, bu t a college professor's work on the same topic, that was the first book written about Bones a nd breaks many stories and research is just speculation. Such are the times we live in. Antony had gone back to his engineering background and was producing a newsletter called Future Technology Intelligence Review (FTIR). Following is Tony's memoir about Stanford, some of his background and what happened to him because of his principles and courageous actions. After that are some of his thoughts on the September 11th attack and writings on the Order of Skull & Bones from FTIR and then some articles from The Phoenix Newsletter, Tony's newsletter from the 1980 s and 90s, some from the time when he was first uncovering the story about Bones.

This was the traditional English grammar school education with five years of two foreign languages, physics, biology, chemistry, music, history, geography, art, mathematics, Englis h, wood and metal workshop with no elective courses and considerable homework. It was a thorough and no-nonsense basic education, very different from th e U.S. high school. My father was a coach builder for Thrupp & Mab- berly making Rolls Royce custom wood automobile bod ies. My grandfather was former head coachman for the Duke of Beaumont. In t he World War One period, he owned a fleet of a dozen London taxis. On my mot her's side, the family stems from a line of substantial businessmen in the Londo n furniture trade. My uncle 83 B T"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY formed the London Pattern company. In brief, I grew up in a family familiar with hand tools, jigs and fixtures, pattern making and a utomobile manufacture. When I left Bishopshalt (in 1941 during World War I I), I went to work for Richard Thomas Steel Company head office in London. This company had installed the first hot and cold strip steel mills in England. I worked in the mill scheduling department until called up to the Army i n July 1943. Mill scheduling provides an excellent education in the capacity, op eration and limits of steel mills and the end uses of various specifications. In the Army, I was trained as a \"driver-wireless op erator\" with extensive courses in radio communication (#19 and #22 sets), line lay ing, mine clearing, field maintenance, Morse code, codes and ciphers, all veh icles through personnel car- riers. Just before D-Day, we were re-designated as the 42nd Armoured Division (a nominal deception unit with a handful of men and vehicles). I landed in Normandy on D+10, and went through to G ermany. For most of this time, numerous individual assignments gave me freedom for days at a time, and opportunity to learn something of European cult ure and industry. Seconded for six months to University of Gottingen for de-Na zification work. Demobilized 1947 with rank of sergeant. In fall of 1947, I started at University of Southam pton and obtained Honors Degree in Economics in 1951. The advantage of South ampton then (and now) is that students and faculty were flexible in study , ideas and work. Martin Fleis- chman and Stanley Pons did their early work on cold fusion at University of Southampton. In the 1940s, study was unregimented a nd free flowing. No grade point system. A major plus was presence of an open Communist Part y and recommended reading in Marx, Engels and Lenin. This proved to b e an excellent foundation to understand the use of dialectical materialism and d eception by the Soviets and their foreign Communists Party allies. In 1951, I spent a few months as a clerk in a plant making gas meters and tinplate instruments; then returned to Richard Thomas & Co ( now part of British Steel). I was appointed to a two years' management training course. This included visits to every major iron and steel plant in England with months spent on the floor of various plants including ore mining, blast furna ces, coke ovens, stripmills, tinplate and bypass mills, annealing and so on. This two-year course gave me an understanding of th e construction and operation of iron and steel plants and a reasonable grasp of metallurgy and metals testing. By 1953, I had become disgusted with the laxity of nationalization. I left England and went to Canada via New York. I worked a year in Canadian steel firms, and then joined a mining exploration firm (D esmac Exploration, Ltd.) in charge of exploration logistics and information acquisition. By 1956, we had discovered major deposits of magnetite iron ore in Northern Quebec (Montgol- 84"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"M EMOIR C ONCERNING E VENTS A T T HE H OOVER I NSTITUTION , S TANFORD U NIVERSITY fier Township) and had programs in several Canadian provinces. I acquired an introduction to geology and drilling techniques in order to evaluate potential mines. I left because it was too cold (i.e., -40° i n winter!). In 1957, I went to New York and was hired by Hoylan d Steel as assistant to the manager of their Los Angeles branch, known as Great Western Steel, Inc. (the manager was an alcoholic, my job was to keep the fi rm on track, my eye on the manager, and quietly report back to New York). In this job, I visited every operating mine in the Western United States and Nor thern Mexico, and most of the significant plants, including the L.A. aircr aft and electronics industries, i.e., Lockheed, Hughes, North American, and Douglas , as well as lumber mills, rood processing and cement plants, quarries, and sh ipbuilding in California, to determine the potential for new alloys and specific ations. In November, 1957, 1 happened to be in the Motorola plant in Phoenix when :he Russians sent up Sputnik. This had an enormous impact on the Motorola engineers, and I was struck by their naive acceptan ce, \"The Russians are ahead of us.\" I knew from my steel experience that the gesta tion period for a strip mill was 6-8 years under western conditions, and the Russian s could not have developed an indigenous strip process in the period 1917-1929 (the start of the first Five Year Plan). From my experience in post-war Germany, when the Soviets dis- mantled and shipped to Russia what was left of Germ an industrial plants (really, a pile of junk), the \"Russians are ahead\" theory ma de no sense at all. Nowhere in my multi-country, multi-plant visits, had I enco untered a Soviet process or innovation. My experience was the opposite to the p revailing perception of Soviet technological power. My assessment was that the USSR in the 1950s and 19 60s was a backward, technically dependent economy, without a support in frastructure. In brief, by mid-1959, I had probably unique traini ng with regard to on-the-floor exposure to industrial processes in fi ve countries. I knew the equip- ment, who made it, its limits, and who used the equ ipment. Every technological process has its own \"signature.\" For example, an ir on blast furnace has precise shapes and measurements; it requires specific input s of iron ore, coke, and lime- stone, of specific grades. You don't design a new b last furnace from scratch — you build on earlier designs with knowledge of limitati ons with each design change. These can be remarkably precise. Ask any engineer. With this varied and detailed technological backgro und, in 1959, I quit business and went to UCLA graduate school. My intent was to study the interface between economics and technology. Rather naively (I see tod ay), I thought theoretical economics could teach me something about the effici ency factors behind engineer- ing design. The immediate impact, however, was the rigid doctrinal structure of American graduate education. It turned out fine tec hnicians, but was decidedly not happy with any original ideas or anything that challenged the textbooks. 85"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Economics, I quickly found, treated technology as a constant given factor, not as a developing engineering dynamic. Once again, the a ssumption \"The Russians are ahead\" was the prevailing doctrine. I spent considerable time in the UCLA Main Library and the Engineering Library where I located a wealth of material suppor ting my idea that everything Soviet had come from the West. I even found the ori ginal contract Averell Harriman signed with the Soviets to develop the Georgian man ganese deposits. (He was taken! I had negotiated similar contracts in Canada, and c ould spot the loopholes.) UCLA libraries also held several series of journals in Russian and English on 1930s construction by Western firms in Russia. Thes e cited the foreign builders never mentioned in the UCLA textbooks on Soviet eco nomic development. At first, I used these findings and ideas in seminars and papers, but soon found they were definitely not welcome, and the idea of challe nging the textbooks bordered on treason. I found that prominent faculty such as Armen Alchian and Jack Hirschleifer, who also worked at Rand Corporation o n Russian strategy, had naive ideas on Russian economic development and kne w nothing — and I mean, nothing— about technology. Products were called, \"w idgets;\" and technology was treated as a constant \"given,\" rather than a dy namic engineering process. I did considerable research for Professor Dudley Pe grum and W.E. Baldwin in transportation and the African copper industry, and wrote an article on the Colombian iron industry, which was later published. The textbooks and article literature on Soviet econ omic development had a truck- size omission: there was nothing on the development and origins of the technology used in the USSR. Every text and article had an ext remely naive and erroneous description of Soviet development. There were no ex ceptions to this statement. Even Clark's The Economics of Soviet Steel, an othe rwise excellent book, had missed the Western origins. Another book was Econom ics ofTechnology, published in the early 60s, and had no understanding of techn ology. It was a meaningless mass of mathematics with no relevance to technology in the slightest. Not one technological process was cited. I feel today as I did 30 years ago — the book is a fraud, but accepted in the academic community as an advance of knowledge. Gradually, I developed a technique in my own resear ch. Assume every Soviet design is indigenous; compare it to similar Western designs known from past experience; locate a transfer mechanism, i.e., inst alled by Western firms, taken from patent literature, copied within the Soviet Un ion in a \"copying bureau.\" Then compare design specifications. Always assume t he design is Soviet, unless the opposite can be proven. The UCLA Ph.D. program was not completed. In one to pic (macroeco- nomics), I was told to repeat one question of the P h.D. finals, but to go ahead with the dissertation (which I did). The Department then gave me a new set of multiple questions. UCLA then denied the Ph.D. I la ter obtained two D.Sc. degrees elsewhere. Dr. Dudley Pegrum, Chairman of m y Committee, then 86"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"M EMOIR C ONCERNING E VENTS A T T HE H OOVER I NSTITUTION , S TANFORD U NIVERSITY pushed me as Assistant Professor of Economics at (n ow) State University of California, Los Angeles. The same kind of political pressure developed when I came up for tenure at Cal State in 1968. It was approved at the department le vel. Then tenure was rejected at the Administration level - even though my first book had been accepted at Hoover Institution and no Cal State economics facul ty member had a published book at that time. There is no question my views on Soviet weaknesses were the cause. In 1963, when I gave a lecture on Soviet development to the faculty, I made the blunt statement that Marxist central planning was not via ble without outside help. The USSR stagnant, and this was a fatal flaw. When I stated that \"Marxism is finished,\" one could feel the intense disapproval - almost, emotional distress - in the audience. By the early 1960s, it was clear that my perception of the Soviet Union as a technically backward and dependent econo my was highly unwel- come to everyone else. The experiences at Motorola, UCLA and Cal State were consistent, in that I found no one agreed with my v iew of the Soviet Union as a backward, stagnant economy. Soviet propaganda was e xtraordinarily successful with its progressive image. W ESTERN T ECHNOLOGY A ND S OVIET E CONOMIC D EVELOPMENT AS A UCLA GRADUATE STUDENT, I began in 1959 to expl ore the early technological history of the Soviet Union, and to l earn technical Russian (enough to translate technical manuals). I said lit tle about this work (except the one lecture cited above), which continued in my five years at Cal State Los Angeles. At Cal State, I engaged a tutor from t he faculty to improve my Russian reading skills. While at Cal State, I tried to obtain funding to sp eed up the work. All I could get was $400 for microfilm of State Department docu ments from Relm Foun- dation. In the early 1960s, I read scores of rolls of State documents, including reports from officers in Moscow, Leningrad, and Rig a, Latvia. These included interviews with American businessmen returning from Russia, and detailed plans and specifications for plants installed by th e West. (Magnitogorsk, Gorki, Uralmash, etc.). These businessmen were not always honest with State officers. They wanted to maintain Soviet good will. A few tol d State officials they were instructed to paint a rosy picture if they wanted c ontracts. The State files supported my theory of technical de pendence. However, I noted that State was reluctant to release certain d ocuments on the purport lists. I made a special point to push for declassification , where I found State resistance. In practice, the resistance guided me to the real g old mines of information. Through Blackwells (Booksellers) in Oxford, England , I bought hundreds of Soviet technical manuals and maintenance charts. It was fascinating to trace the 87"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY technology in these manuals to systems I knew in th e West. Even the Western language was adopted — for example, \"Stilsona\" for \"Stilson wrench.\" The maintenance and training charts were invaluable in tracing origins. To this day, I don't understand why the Soviet Union allowed exp ort of these items. For someone who knew the technology, it was like labeli ng the Western manufac- turer. The Soviet copying bureaus were helpful. The y duplicated EXACTLY the Western design. In consumer products, however, the Soviets often used military spec materials, yielding an overweight, cl umsy product. Sometimes, the Soviets varied the way a part was made, i.e., b y casting or stamping instead of forging. In 1963, the State Department public view was \"the Soviets have their own self developed technology\" — i.e., Directly contrary to their own files. By 1966, 1 had completed the first volume of Wester n Technology and Soviet Economic Development (1917 to 1930). It took about eight years, using my own funds (except $400), and with the facts consistentl y pointing away from academic and official statements and assumptions. Soviet technology was western technology — period. Soviet attempts at innovation (i.e., the electric tractor) were pitifu l. The manuscript was sent unsolicited to Henry Regner y Company in Chicago. I was surprised to receive a reply letter from Henr y Regnery himself, to the ef- fect this was \"an extremely important manuscript bu t not commercial.\" I wrote Hoover and received a letter back from Alan Belmont (Assistant Director). He had taken early retirement from the FBI, where he w as Assistant Director for Domestic Intelligence. In response, I sent the manu script to Hoover. Belmont suggested I spend the summer of 1966 at Hoover. I a ccepted. During this sum- mer, I kept a low profile, avoided the social circu it (much to Director Glenn Campbell's disgust), and concentrated on work. Fran kly, I didn't want a repeat of the UCLA and Cal State hostility. Only Al Belmon t appeared to understand my hermit-like stance, and I will be eternally grat eful for his understanding, and the \"cover\" he provided me, unasked. I found that Belmont had insisted Roger Freeman, a long-time friend of Director Campbell, a man of many contacts and a for mer White House Aide, read the manuscript. Belmont then sent it to ex-Rus sian engineers for evaluation. The Russians were definite: \"Sutton is right.\" Belm ont told me this, and added the manuscript was also going to Sovietologists, bu t not to worry if they made adverse comments. (He once said something to the ef fect, \"we do not accept them.\") At some point, Roger Freeman told me that \" they\" (i.e., White House or CIA) didn't know about the \"early period.\" I rem ember saying that my work should be repeated and double checked. It made our policy towards the Soviet Union naive and idiotic. 88"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"M EMOIR C ONCERNING E VENTS A T T HE H OOVER I NSTITUTION , S TANFORD U NIVERSITY I agreed to return to Cal State for another year, a nd then go to Hoover as a Research Fellow to complete the two further volumes . Campbell has claimed that Hoover financed the first volume also. They di d not. I submitted a complete Volume One, financed by myself. I returned to Hoove r about mid-1968 and completed the two volumes by 1971. Volumes One and Two were brought into print fairly quickly. I had only one minor problem with the Editors. They wanted to remove everything on Soviet military use of our technology. I agreed to this. I completed Volume Three by 1971 and anticipated it would be published promptly, like the first two volumes. In fact, it w ent quickly to page proof, which I corrected — then I heard nothing for a year. Norm ally, a book moves quickly from page proof to final book to recoup investment. My inquiries were met with a blank wall. All I could get from Al Belmont was, \"It's coming.\" We had a war in Vietnam, and I could daily see the product of U.S. and European technology killing our men in Vietnam, whi le we were still supplying technology for Soviet plants to manufacture weapons and supplies for North Vietnam. I considered this immoral and lunatic beha vior. Further, I had personal experience of war in Normandy, in Belgium and the R hine Crossing in March, 1945. Active war is not pleasant. Its cold, dirty, dangerous. My concern was with men on the ground in Vietnam rather than armchair a cademics and politicians who had probably never been on the dangerous end of a gun, but who were making technological decisions without knowing tech nology. In particular, I was horrified at State Department statements direct ly opposed to materials in their own files. I decided to do an end-run around whomever was dela ying the third volume, which had current application to policy, and was ob viously being delayed. I agreed with Arlington House to quietly write anothe r volume on the military use of our technological transfers and so-called, \" peaceful trade.\" My planned, deliberate objective was to spring loose my Volume Three, by publishing the seg- ments Hoover wanted \"out\" — i.e., the military end- use segments supplied by the West — and so, force their hand. I fully admit this was my intent. I would do the same again, only quicker, and with more publ icity. About this time, Henry Kissinger OK'd export of the Centalign B machines to the Soviet Union. These had only one end use — t o machine ball-bearing races to extremely high accuracy for MIRV-ing Sovie t missiles. The USSR could then pinpoint-target the United States. The W ashington arguments were wrong. (However, DOD had people warning of the dang ers.) The Soviets could not manufacture Centalign B machines, and no one el se in the world had an equivalent machine. Kissinger's action confirmed to me that something w as badly wrong in Wash- ington. His \"detente\" strategy was to give the Sovi et long-term, needed techno- logical advantage in exchange for short-term politi cal promises which might or might not be kept. Kissinger called this policy \"li nkages.\" I called it \"lunacy.\" We were handing over what Soviets really wanted (advan ced technology) to receive 89"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY empty words. It still baffles me how Kissinger can be regarded as an \"expert.\" Anyone can hand over the keys to the safe and ask n othing in return. Further, the McNamara \"rules of engagement\" had tie d the hands of the military in Vietnam. In effect, we helped the Sovie ts build trucks, and then told our pilots not to shoot them up. When one looked at the entire picture, I could only arrive at one conclusion — treason. I have never formed final conclusion on policy make rs like Kissinger, Rusk and McNamara. It could be stupidity, ignorance, ego, or worse. Frankly, I don't know. When foreign diplomats and military people asked me , \"do you think Kissinger is a Soviet agent?\" I replied, \"I don't know. He co uld be ignorant.\" I told no one except Arlington House about National Suicide. It was written in three months, and rushed through production in a nother three months. It was published as, National Suicide: Military Aid to the Soviet Union (available today as, \" The Best Enemy Money Can Buy\"). My advance co py is marked, \"Received August 27th, 1973.\" When it was received, Volume Th ree of Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development was still being hel d in page proofs, confirm- ing my belief that the delay was deliberate to prev ent the information becoming public. (This was 8 months after correction of page proofs.) From rumors, it appeared the pressure was coming from the White Hou se. Some days after receiving my advance copy of Nation al Suicide, I received a call to go to the Director's office (Glenn Campbell). I found a group waiting, includ- ing Alan Belmont, Dick Staar (CIA), Stefan Possony, and perhaps a few others. Campbell immediately launched into an attack, stati ng that I had plagiarized the text of National Suicide, and that I had no right t o produce such a book. My reply was: (1) 1 cannot plagiarize my own work; (2) Hoover itself had asked for the military sections to be removed from Hoover volumes, thus releas- ing the material; (3) We had men being killed in Vi etnam, and I had every right and duty to draw public attention to this if our po licies were aiding the enemy; and (4) 1 remember saying, \"tell me where I am wron g on a single fact.\" No one ever did. I gave some examples, i.e., we were sending machine tools to the Gorki truck plant outside Moscow, and GAZ (Gorki) trucks were o n the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The U.S. pilots even commented they looked like For d trucks (Gorki was built by Ford Motor Company). Soviet ships on the supply run to North Vietnam wer e larger, faster vessels, sold by the West under \"peaceful trade.\" I had obta ined a list of the vessels from sources that emerged from the woodwork after public ation of my first book. From the Soviet Register of Shipping, I located the type, design and origin of every Soviet marine diesel engine. Most were Burmei ster and Wain (Denmark), or Soviet copies. In brief, my information was precise and accurate. Campbell asked me to have National Suicide withdrawn. I refused. End of meeti ng. 90"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"M EMOIR C ONCERNING E VENTS A T T HE H OOVER I NSTITUTION , S TANFORD U NIVERSITY I called Arlington, and they assured me they would not buckle or withdraw the book. Another meeting followed a few weeks later. Campbel l said I had no agreement or contract with Hoover Institution, and I was no l onger a Research Fellow. To stall for time, I said I did have a contract (ac tually, I did not), and I had no intention of changing my position. I later heard that a few Senators and Congressmen h ad called Campbell to sup- port me. A week later, Al Belmont came to my office and handed me a contract, signed by himself, with the words, \"You are going t o need this.\" Hoover Institution then removed my name and that of my secretary from the Hoover personnel list. I became a non-person. I n subsequent speeches, I found this Hoover Institution action to have signif icant impact on audiences. Apparently, it convinced people that I was probably right. Hoover also rapidly released Volume Three. They continued to pay me unt il I left voluntarily a year later. On the way out the door on the last day, Rog er Freeman intercepted me and said, \"We can work this out; let me talk with C ampbell.\" I said thank you, but no thanks. My sense was one of absolute disgust. I had, with m y own funds and time, un- dertaken ten years of research of obvious value to the United States, and put up with the naive stupidity of academics at UCLA and C al State to get the work into print. The response? — insult and harassment! I concluded Campbell was a weak patsy, and that Was hington didn't give a damn about our men in Vietnam. (This is still my assessment today.) The academic world by and large was more interested in preserving its little stock of knowledge. Academic freedom is a sham. My thanks came from individual citizens. After spee ches, scores would come up and say, \"God bless you,\" or, \"We are with you.\" One speech filled the Hol- lywood Palladium with standees at the back. At the end of the speech, I was called back three times to the podium. The more macabre wo uld say, \"it's a wonder you are still alive.\" A few gestures were practical. A group of anonymous airline pilots gave me (through a friend) a gift of $10,000. A Congressman inserted my speeches into the Congressional record. I had a call from Antoine Pinay, former Prime Minister of France. Several VFW posts passed resolutions of commendation. And so on. Not once did anyone challenge the data or the argum ent. The press ignored the books (with the exception of the Manchester Union L eader in New Hampshire and the Telegraph in London). However, on a later v isit to London, The Times sent a message asking me to meet with the Editor (n ow Lord Rees-Mogg), who asked a key question: \"Why do you think they are so upset?\" Roughly, my answer was, \"I really don't know. I guess I must be close to the truth.\" 91"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY I made a number of foreign trips, and met senior mi litary or government people from Mexico, Argentina, South Africa, France, Belgi um and other countries. About 1969, Campbell urged me to submit my first vo lume to the University of London for a Ph.D. This I did. As I had scores o f favorable academic reviews, the procedure should have been automatic. Peter Wil es was appointed examiner, and proceeded to raise every conceivable petty poin t possible. I made two trips to London, and did what I could to answer his point s. In the end, I gave up, and figured it was another academic game. In about 1970, I was contacted by a Colonel Samuel Clabaugh, who at one time had been U.S. military attache in London, a fr iend of Averell Harriman, and, formerly, with OSS and CIA. He was apparently in routine contact with Eleanor Dulles. Over perhaps a year or 18 months, w e exchanged letters and meetings (I went to his apartment in Washington, D. C. for lunch). I was quite clear and definite: our policy is suicidal, develop ed by the naive or self serving. I remember repeatedly making the point; if I am wrong , someone will challenge me, but all we have is silence. No one dares challe nge me. I know the technology, and I am right. About 1971, Hoover Institution wanted me to give a paper at Ditchley Park in England to a group of businessmen, bankers and a cademics. This is where I met M. Pinay, former Prime Minister of France, who greeted me, \"Tres bien; tres bien.\" At one point, the Chairman of Dunlop Holding s (who had built several plants in the Soviet Union) stood up and said, \"Sut ton's information is correct; we have built tire plants in the USSR for many years, and we will continue to build these plants even if it is my own suicide.\" Even to day, I can't fully understand the motivation behind this statement. It's not rati onal, but that's what the man said. It raises the question of whether some form o f brainwashing was used on foreign businessmen. I know there was pressure. Over the years, my conclusions have firmed up rough ly as follows: 1. The U.S. was suckered royally by Soviet propagan da (the \"perception prob- lem\"). In most cases, the conduits were not agents (like A mes), but individual business- men, academics, and politicians looking out for the ir own interests and proposing self-serving policies without challenge. 2. My argument was correct and remains correct toda y. The Soviet Union was incapable of self-sustaining development and re lied on the West for most technical advance. The Russians are very capable pe ople; it was the system that failed, the lack of a mechanism to transform i deas to technical reality in a rational, useful way. 92"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"M EMOIR C ONCERNING E VENTS A T T HE H OOVER I NSTITUTION , S TANFORD U NIVERSITY 3. My experience has been that the academic world is l argely concerned with preserving the status quo and its own perks and pre stige. Really new ideas are automatically dismissed. To me, this makes the enti re fabric of degrees and honors suspect. These reflect merely an ability to absorb what is already known, not any contribution to future knowledge. 4. My greatest surprise is the sheer lack of moral act ion. No one asks, what is right? What is moral? I find this entirely disgusting and shortsighted. The truth will always out, sooner or later. I prefer to be remembe red as someone honestly concerned with others, rather than as a sham, self- serving political type. Glenn Campbell even sneered at my moral approach in one w ell-remembered conver- sation: GC: \"Tony, you have a problem.\" TS: \"What is that?\" GC: \"You are a moralist.\" TS: \"So?\" GC: \"You can't survive being a moralist. They will brea k your rice bowl.\" On the other hand, no individual, and certainly no country survives without a set of principles. Pragmatism is shortsighted, a cr utch for the weak, a cop-out tor the greedy. 5. Certain names stand out as key in the Soviet per ceptions program and suc- cessful operation at the highest levels in Washingt on: Armand Hammer. Son of Julius Hammer (founder and fi nancier for the Com- munist Party U.S.A.). Access to every President fro m Roosevelt onwards. Protected at the highest levels in Washington. Averell Harriman. Received $1 million gift from Sov iets about 1928. (I can provide the State Department file numbers if requir ed.) State Department was told, \"hands off on Harriman. Key member of the Geo rgetown group that had major influence on policy and intelligence. Henry Kissinger. I need only quote Anatoly Dobrynin (In Confidence, Random House, 1995). \"... more than once when Kissinger kn ew I was going over to the State Department he would ask me to bear in mind th at Rogers had not been told about this, that or some other aspect of the i ssue under discussion and I was not to tell Rogers about it.\" 93"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Out of the hundreds of examples, I would select the export of Centalign B ma- chines as the key to determine whose side Kissinger was on. I presume there was no mark program on our side (see Appendix), and in fact, it would be difficult because the product has precise measurable characte ristics. Kissinger, over numer- ous DOD protests, provided the USSR with MIRVing ca pability. Unless there was some deception program on our side which required Kiss- inger's action as a cover, then one is driven to th e conclusion — unwelcome as it is —that Kissinger was a Soviet agent. Sutton wa s just one irritant in a larger game, but if the strings provided in the Sutton res earch were pulled, he had the capability of unraveling the entire Soviet percepti ons program. No one has stepped forward, in 1996 — or even in 20 01 — to say, Sutton was right or wrong, because, even today, reputation s are at stake. The United States owes me an official apology. When they shoul d have encouraged me to work further to pull on the strings, I was squashed , threatened, harassed, and discarded — for whose benefit? T HE A MES C ASE HE SIGNIFICANCE OF AMES is not that a Soviet agent existed in CIA. This was discussed widely back in the 1970s and before. Even names were floating around. The significance is that Ames surfaces the perceptions program in a way that could not be done by any academic writer. The Soviets paid Ames well — very well, by Soviet standards — to maintain a fa cade. There were many ways Ames could be used; this was judged to be the most important. And it confirms what I had been saying since the late 1950s. When L enin wrote about the \"useful idiots,\" and the \"deaf, mute blindmen,\" one wonders if he knew how successful his perceptions program was going to be. Lenin suck ered the West royally. Ames is a pitiful pawn, but if you pull on the Ames stri ng, you'll find the rest of the story — and more names. Be prepared for some shocks.

In brief, it is possible by slightly changing speci fications of manufacturing equipment, to affect quality and performance of the end product. For example, changing the dimensions and shape of a blast furnac e has significant effect on cost, quality and quantity of output. By slight var iations in equipment sold to the USSR, one could reduce the benefits.

I did once mention it to Alan Belmont, i.e., that I knew of th e possibility of such a pro- gram; that, if implemented, it was not effective; a nd I had not mentioned the possibility even in passing. Possibly, Soviet political intervention into techno logy made such a program partly unnecessary. A great deal of equipment was r uined because Soviet political rigures insisted on early and fast startups, insuff icient maintenance and inadequate training. Russian engineers up to the 70s had about the same hands-on technical experience as a master mechanic in the United State s. This has probably changed in some fields, i.e., computers and software. Another factor is the absence of a secondary infras tructure in the Soviet Union. In the United States, thousands of machine s hops, tool and die shops, and independent experts of all kinds give a wealth of backup experience where and when needed. This market-generated structure gi ves a richness of experience and flexibility to major corporations. The Soviet U nion had nothing remotely similar; everything was handled \"inhouse.\" It is possible that CIA decided a \"mark\" program wa s unnecessary, i.e., it was really suckered by the Soviets, and truly belie ved the Soviet Union had a super-power industrial structure. Or, a mark progra m may have been inadequately designed. In any event, a mark program was not iden tified. However, it is difficult to believe that some key technologies (as the Centa lign B) were not modified before shipment, if only as insurance. If we did no t have such a program for key technologies, one has to ask, why not? This raises another question. Why did policy debate always focus on the last sale or contract (i.e., the marginal unit) rather than t he total of all sales in that tech- nology. If debate was focused on the total industry , rather than single contract, then Soviet dependence is obvious. In my exploration of the State files, I found that State Department officials filed reports with military information without dis tribution. The information was killed. To gauge the success of the Soviet percepti ons program, one would have to thoroughly explore the hidden recesses of CIA to determine if a mark program was implemented at any point, in any way. If CIA co nsidered such a program and rejected it, then the U.S. really did have a percep tions problem of extraordinary magnitude. For example, if Kissinger allowed the Ce ntalign Bs to go forward without a mark program, then one has to have the mo st serious suspicions of Kissinger's motives. I have no way of knowing the truth. However, one ca n deduce a problem from other technologies allowed to go forward, and where tracking subsequent operation proved that the Soviets had received the most advanced technology (i.e., advanced aluminum rolling equipment, marine diesels, and so on) without modifications.

A PPENDIX T WO : L ESSONS N OT L EARNED HE HOOVER INSTITUTION SAGA starts up again in 1985 with a repeat of the perceptions disaster, and one that may have long-te rm consequences worse than the Soviet perceptions program. U.S. scientist s are running what amounts to a scam to keep their gravy train flowing. This i s losing lead time for the United States. A new technological paradigm is emerging an d the science establishment is doing its best to deride and ignore the facts. After leaving Hoover Institution, I continued to wo rk on technological re- search. I found it relatively easy to earn a modest living as an author (in spite of Campbell's prediction that my rice bowl would be br oken), and in the last 20 years, have authored another 20 or so books. I foun d regular bookstore distribu- tion closed to my books. Campbell was right in this aspect. But apparently others were having their rice bowls broken, and a vast \"al ternative\" book publishing industry is in great part due to the rise of new pu blishing houses scattered across the United States, handling the work of those who h ave been persecuted, or whose writing falls outside the narrow New York gui delines. In any event, I generated enough spare time to work on technology. My explora- tion went back to ancient technology and science, t hrough alchemy, Goethe, the Steiner movement, and Wilhelm Reich, as well as dis carded discoveries of the last 200 years. I found hundreds of ideas and discoverie s had been buried for political or financial reasons. In particular, I found that t he ancients \"knew something we don't today.\" I found that \"underground\" researcher s were probing modern dis- coveries inconsistent with and wholly beyond our ma terialist view of the universe. The energy-matter equations, the basis of physics a nd the \"laws\" based on these equations were under assault - partly from research ers in Oriental traditions, and partly from workbench research picking up some of F araday's observations back in 1831. Other developments were coming from the wo rk of Wilhelm Reich and the anthroposophic tradition. Future 21st century t echnology will be a paradigm reflecting these discoveries, ignored in the materi alist tradition. Futurists see the future as extrapolation of the he at-pressure/centrifugal-expan- sion technologies of the industrial age, plus semic onductor technologies. What I see is an entirely new paradigm based on cold vacuum/ce ntripetal vortex technologies, with semiconductors as enabling technology only. Qu ite different from, and far more powerful than our contemporary technology, and environmentally pure. About 1985, 1 wrote to Glenn Campbell (who had been Reagan's Chairman of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, and the logical recipient for any 96 T"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"M EMOIR C ONCERNING E VENTS A T T HE H OOVER I NSTITUTION , S TANFORD U NIVERSITY such ideas), and suggested the new paradigm should be investigated. Camp- bell probably thought I was looking for some kind o f grant (I wasn't), and passed me on to Roger Freeman. I met with Roger Fre eman at his house on the Stanford campus and briefly outlined my ideas. I told Freeman, \"I am not looking for anything. I am concerned with the futur e of this country. The sci- ence establishment, like the Sovietological establi shment, is protecting its turf tor self-serving reasons.\" Roger Freeman suggested I should see Edward Teller, whom he described as open minded. I found it difficult to get across the point that \"open mindedness\" is not enough when dealing with a scientific culture t hat has thoroughly permeated our society. What my analysis suggested was existen ce of a superior technology to our contemporary technological paradigm, and it would be most unlikely that Teller could grasp its elements, any more than Kiss inger had grasped the elements of Soviet technological dependence. I understand that Teller did agree to talk, but the meeting did not take place. Frankly, I wasn't going to waste my time. I had bee n insulted and abused trying to help the United States, and I wasn't going to ri sk any more abuse from \"deaf mute blindmen\" (Lenin). Time would show whether I w as right or wrong. If the gatekeepers won't listen, they have the problem, no t me. Just three years after this Stanford meeting, Pons and Fleischman announced \"cold fusion.\" This was instantly derided as fraudu lent by the orthodox physics establishment, and Pons and Fleischman were driven out of the United States to France. Teller's reaction to cold fusion confirm ed I was right in not pursuing the Freeman suggestion. Cold fusion is part of the new paradigm. In the last few months of 1995, the U.S. government has confirmed i ts viability. If Campbell had taken me seriously in 1985, it is quite possibl e that Pons and Fleischman would have had more favorable reception. In fact, t he Japanese now finance their work in the south of France, and the U.S. now admit s they are correct - but has lost a decade of lead time. By extraordinary coincidence, Fleischman taught ele ctrochemistry at University of Southampton (where I studied in 1948) and Pons w as his graduate student also at Southampton. (Further, one of the leading resear chers in the new paradigm is Harold Aspden, today, at Southampton.) In January, 1990, 1 started Future Technology Intel ligence Report to record my analysis, and as a device to pick up information. F or six years, I have recorded monthly my ongoing work, a matter of record for his tory to read. Once again the myopic vision of U.S. technical inte lligence is highlighted. Ames is a disaster. Yet the gatekeepers of science and policy are creating another disaster, and will place the U.S. into irreversible technological decline by ignor- ing the new paradigm. We have politicized decision making in technology, and U.S. politics is a poor guide to technological decision making. A moral app roach would have saved the U.S. yet another embarrassment. If Campbell had taken steps to correct the 97"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY injustice done to this writer in 1971 (and earlier) , then the cold fusion reaction could have emerged in a different environment. I wa s already aware of over unity devices, and was looking at over unity N-machines w hen I approached Campbell in 1985. In fact, if Campbell had backed me in 1987 , the U.S. would have ar- rived at a quicker and more accurate assessment of the emerging paradigm, and would have been ready for the hostile resistance th at was forthcoming within the U.S. science establishment. If anything, the treatment of my research is proof that in the long run, the moral approach is the only practical approach. Just because Edward Teller designed the H-bomb does n't ensure he will under- stand N-machines, cold fusion, or etheric weather c ontrol. These are outside the orthodox physicists' framework of understanding, ou tside the laws of physics, and require study of an entirely new framework of a nalysis, which is at this time incomplete. The only agreement in cold fusion, for example, is that \"something\" happens in the lattice structure. The \"something\" i s under discussion and inves- tigation. Much like electricity in the 1850s before Maxwell perfected the theo- retical understanding. Etheric weather engineering is even more challenging. I have found that mathematicians (who appreciate gold en proportions) are more understanding than meteorologists. In general, elec trical engineers appear to grasp the new paradigm more readily. (Kincheloe, de Palma, Constable, Aspden, Tiller, Inomata, Tewari, etc.) My greatest criticism and sorrow is that decisions on research directions are taken by those with the most to lose by change and who ra tionalize obstruction by clinging to obsolete ideas and citing obsolete, man -made \"laws.\" That's no way to make progress — or for a country to survive. 98"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"T ONY ' S N EWSLETTERS ANTONY SUTTON produced several different newsletter s during his lifetime as a way to stay in touch with his many readers and to continue his research on his many varied interests.

Understand this and you will understand th e trials that await New Tech- nology down the road a way. Okay, you say, but I al ways knew we were peons, and somebody unelected was running the show. The po int is that no academic has yet pinned this control down to an operating ph ilosophy working in defiance of the U.S. Constitution. Suspicion is not enough. Throwing names around is not enough. Big charts with lots of arrows is not e nough. We have to pin down the how and why, the operational procedures. If we are right in our analysis, you will in coming years see another layer of the onion skin peeled back. The Emperor really has no clothes. The Bush Administration is no different from the Cl inton Administration when it comes to new and more efficient energy tech nology. Both Administra- tions publicly ignore new technology or define it a s beefed up, old technology to favor those interests who pay vast sums to support the two major parties — and get a piece of the action. We hesitate to recommend Hegel for your reading. We see Hegel as turgid nonsense, but very influential. If you want Hegel's statement on the relations between \"Master\" (them) and \"Slave\" (us), see pages 520 to 523 of Phenomenology of Spirit. This is the section on \"Lordship and Bon dage.\" (We term it, \"Master and Slave\"): The self consciousness of the Lord is essentially r elated to the being of the mere things he uses and uses up, and these he enjoy s through the bondsman's (slave) self consciousness. The bondsman prepares a nd arranges things for the enjoyment of the Lord. In brief, the function of us — the slaves — is to w ork for the Master. See Bush/Cheney as the Lord and you and I as the slaves , then it all becomes clear. Our job is to go along. Theirs is to steal and grab and enjoy the product. The State is the vehicle they use to grab the product l egally. The State is the Master, and we are supposed to be obedient slaves. Quite a racket, if you can keep it going. And this is the purpose of Bohemian Grove an d Skull & Bones. Clever, isn't it? You are all running around thinking Repub lican and Democrat, while the real action is somewhere else. So within this Hegelian frame, let's take a look at the Bush-Cheney energy plan. The Bush-Cheney energy plan is wholly based on conv entional fossil-atomic tech- nology owned by the same interests that financed Bu sh and are prominent in the S & B and Bohemian Grove. If the steam and water wheel interests had kicked in for his re-election, no doubt they would have a place in th e Bush-Cheney Plan. It's all about cash for re-election, put up enough cash, and you b ecome one of the Masters.

Hegel is therefore intimatel y related to Skull & Bones and Bohemian Grove. The reason that outside observe rs have not been able to get a handle on establishment power is because they have been trapped into a right-left dichotomy and kept there by carefully ba ited political promises, rarely kept except to financial contributors. Collection of names and organizations is insufficie nt. One needs to know their operating philosophy to learn their goals and how t hey achieve their goals. This is not political meandering. Unless you understand the control features in today's world, you cannot make correct decisions on future technology. The input for the Bush-Cheney energy plan came only from conventional energy interests. The Administration refuses to rel ease the working papers. Why? Because these will demonstrate that only a few energy firms got access to Cheney with their proposals. These were clearly sel f-serving proposals. No one else was even considered. Certainly not renewable e nergy sources or free energy, Just as Hegel would have it. Those who gather at Bo hemian Grove and Bones — the Masters — got the rewards. The citizen slaves who do the thinking and the development get nothing. Same with Clinton. The Clinton Administration engin eered a sabotage plan in 1996 to collapse the Congress on Free Energy sch eduled to be held in Wash- ington, D.C. Bush-Cheney just left them out of cons ideration. This closed-shop procedure is, of course, the fasci st tableau, and directly out of Hegel, who also provides the philosophic fuel fo r fascism and communism. So far, only a few commentators have made this obse rvation, and wherever you took your \"poli-sci\" courses didn't tell you this. Our name for the Bush-Clinton version is \"smiling f ascism,\" and it stems directly from the \"right Hegelians\" of the 19th cen tury. Bush himself can trace to 1832 through Skull and Bones, and its formation in 1832 in Hegelian Germany and the U.S. Even Domhoff, who has written in detai l about Bohemian Grove, missed the link to Hegel through Minerva the Owl. Today, according to our sources, Morgan Stanley is preparing the IPO for Black Light Power (proven free energy). It will com e to market in about two years. Wall Street (a lot of the Masters hang out i n Wall Street) needs these two years to dump conventional energy assets. But don't be surprised if a wrench gets thrown into the works. We don't trust Washingt on, D.C. one bit when it comes to New Technology or what they will do with t he technology as they try to seize control. Similarly, California utilities are trying to dump their resource assets onto the State and the taxpayer before they become worthless . This is right on schedule as we predicted many years ago. First, fuel cells will have a run in about 2003 and 2004. Then free energy will start to emerge. By 2005, everybody and his dog will be looking for free energy proposals.

By 2005, the insiders will have dumped conventional energy assets long before the BLP IPO hits the market. Be careful. We know of only three, maybe four useful free energy technologies: BLP, MEG, Cold Fus ion, and a Canadian project, already picked off by the U.S. Navy. MEG is not in as strong a position as BLP because C olonel Bearden is U.S. Army (Retired), and subject to pressure. We like hi s technical approach, but Bearden himself well knows the pressures he faces. Cold fusion is fully proven, but not yet repeatable . It was deliberately crippled, early on. The initial blow to destroy was cast by f ormer President Bush (also S & B) in 1989. The Canadian project is based on nano technology and is way over unity (>1000%). This was demonstrated to the U .S. Navy — and then disappeared. Note also that BLP has a director (Brewer) who was former Assistant Secretary of Energy in the Reagan Administration. BLP is desc ribed by the Internet service, <psst-heyu.com> as the \"one that got away.\" Maybe not quite a plausible theory is that if free energy is to emerge, the U.S. Government (run by the Masters) would much prefer a government monopoly or control by interests close to the Masters. In ot her words, make a profit out of something essentially free. How to seize it? The re are many ways. At the mo- ment, we say no more.

We don't think so. What may happen is th is: the AMA will suddenly get religion and adopt radionics. Stranger things h ave happened. Most important here is the theoretical justificatio n for radionics formulated in the work of the late famed quantum physicist, David Bohm, one-time Professor of Physics at University of London. Take a look at Chapter 7 of The Undivided Universe, by Bohm & Hiley, entitled \"Non locality.\" Bohm says the opposition t o \"non locality\" (this is what physicists call \"action at a distance\") has a historical explanation, and Einstein's \"spooky action\" comment is not based on science or logic, but on mere assumption.

This assump- tion does not reflect observation, and in fact, is a continuation of Isaac Newton's comment that non locality is a \"philosophical absur dity.\" The establishment is headed, then, towards two road blocks. Free energy is here, proven and scheduled for installation about 2 004 - 2005. The earlier Bush administration shot down cold fusion with a stacked Blue Ribbon Committee, but Randall Mills was too persistent and thorough. The government will have to make a deal with Mills or go the seizure route. Medical radionics is here, proven and available, fr ee today. Note the use of the word \"free\" in both cases. Not quite free, but close enough. If it is free, it cannot be controlled for private gain. Nobody can own it. What the U.S. can do is impose a tax to remove the free aspect or don ate the technology to friends. This, alone, guarantees more skullduggery in coming years. No way are the powers that be going to allow free energy without t heir control. This is fundamen- tal. If Randall Mills is stubborn and won't make a deal, they use national security. And if you don't know how they use national securit y, then read our America's Secret Establishment. Randall Mills is not Tony Sut ton. We would promptly put the BLP patents into the public domain, and make th e lab information freely available. But Mills has sweated blood for 10-15 ye ars and deserves a payback; so do his loyal shareholders. Does Washington know all this? Possibly most politi cians and bureaucrats do not. But what about those who make the decisions? We can go back 30 years, and cite CIA Director Will iam Casey, who said CIA did not know the West built the Soviet Union un til the 1970s. Yet the State Department files (State used to do the CIA's job) a re crammed with information (Microcopy 316). That's where we found the story in the 50s and 60s. (Casey was not courte- ous enough to cite this Editor as the source of his knowledge, but have you ever known a Government official to be courteous? — or t ruthful?) Probably the strangest part of this story is that S ecretary of State Dean Rusk and Assistant Secretary of State Main (in 1963) wen t on public record with statements like: The Soviets have their own self-developed technolog y and are not dependent on U.S. technology. (Rusk) These statements were nonsense, and directly oppose d to the massive evidence in the State Department Decimal File. It took this writer three massive volumes to show the falsity. We then privately and quietly produced a fourth volume to show that the Soviets also depended on us for milit ary technology as well. (Na- tional Suicide, 1974) — so privately that the book was on the street before the CIA picked up the news. When we refused to withdraw the volume, we were fired at a momentous meeting in August 1973.

They had their orders. The Masters knew they w ere wrong, and wanted to avoid embarrassment and public exposure. A few, lik e Zbigniew Brzezinski and Richard Pipes, took our side, but were soon quieted . It took Casey and the CIA ten years to quietly repeat our work and find we we re correct. After this, we took nothing out of Washington at fa ce value. In brief, there is no sure thing about free energy.

And if real ambitious, they want a freeway or building after their name. The welfare o f citizens is very much second- ary. Don't expect any change.

But, above all, we need some explanations from Washington, D.C. e need to know why this happened. The Presidential talk about evil and \"America under attack\" is ridiculous. Why do these people hate America so much? What have the government and the multi-nation als done to achieve this level of enmity? Why has Washington suppressed free energy development? We don't need Saudi Arabia or the other oil producers; we need open-mindedness in Washington. Even further, we spend $30 billion a year on intell igence, yet no advance warning, and no action! This strains our credulity. The hijackers came into this country in mid summer, and were recorded on the CIA \"terrorist watch list\" as \"terrorists.\" The ball stopped right there. The Whi te House was informed. The people doing the watching did that and no more. The y watched while terrorists were allowed to take no-landing Right training and do their planning in peace and quiet. It appears to us the operation was \"allowed to go forward\" — a scenario we have not seen discussed in the media. How can yo u spend $30 billion a year on intelligence, and ignore 19 known terrorists? We know the CIA informed the White House. No one said, \"stop them.\" This reminds us of a similar snafu in the 1960s. Th e CIA said it did not know that the U. S. had built the Soviet Union. Nothing has changed. Either we have the most unintelligent of intelligence agencie s, throwing money at useless SIGNIT systems, or somebody has another agenda out there — and the power to order \"don't do anything.\" With hundreds of billions a year spent on defense, four planes are able to sneak in and bring down two landmark buildings and hit the Pentagon without triggering defenses. This is incredible. A complete collapse of defenses. We need a full and documented answer. How much was known an d when? This put-off of \"revealing our intelligence sources\" is plain si lly. We have no intelligence if we can't use it — period! To us, it looks very much like the Washington action pre-Pearl Harbor in 1941. Roosevelt had the Japanes e code messages and allowed the attack to occur. This is also a repeat of the collapse of U.S. intel ligence in the technical \"per- ceptions problem\" with the Soviets.

Radionics, discovered in 1924 by a San Francisco do ctor, Albert Abrams, was ruthlessly suppressed by the American Medical A ssociation in its effort to monopolize American medicine. In fact, radionics may be the ideal defense for bio logical warfare. Radionics can protect up to 1/2 square mile, but thanks to AMA gr eed and myopia, the U.S. has no usable radionic defense. Any system using li fe energy can be influenced by radionics. But neither life energy nor radionics is officially recognized in the United States. If anything is to be done, it will b e by individual citizens. We don't believe that Al Queda cares what is offici ally recognized by the U.S. establishment. They have one question: does the Uni ted States have a defense? The facts are extraordinary, but not surprising to those who follow govern- ment. There is a vaccine against anthrax — efficien cy unknown. Only sufficient vaccine exists for the military. None is available for civilians. Antibiotics have very limited use.

September 11? ur information is, the White House knew on August 2 3, 2001, and had a list of the terrorists from CIA. We ask this becaus e other Administrations have allowed attacks \"to go forward\" for political reasons. We can cite three or tour such cases. The most well known is December, 1 941, when Roosevelt had intercepts of the Japanese Pearl Harbor attack code s well beforehand, but allowed the attack to go forward to bring the U.S. into war . The code messages were forwarded to Hawaii by commercial routes, the slowe st possible method. They arrived well after the attack. In September, 2001, the entire New Utrecht High Sch ool in New York knew a week beforehand'that the Twin Towers were to be att acked. (Journal News, October 11, 2001.) If a high school had advance warning, th en someone in Washington must have had that same information. QUESTION NO. 2: ISN'T CIA A WASTE OF MONEY? We spend $30 billion a year on intelligence, and we are asked to believe no one in Washington had advance warning! Not impossib le, but unlikely. What are we doing? Well, we are still waiting for r elease of the Iran-Contra papers. Olly North was smuggling planeloads of coca ine into the U.S. under CIA auspices. This has been completely concealed by Congress. The Bush family supplied the oil rigs used as transit points for th e cocaine. Very few know this today because Washington has clamped secrecy on the operation.

Incompetence in Washington, D. C. The November 2000 FTIR one year ago headlined a war ning: we are on the verge of disaster. FTIR identified the Middle East, terrorism and the heavy over- hang of gold supply. The significance is this: Wash ington has a thousand times more information than FTIR. It lacks a capability t o analyze and then act on information. The prediction of a gold overhang is i mportant, because it meant that in the event of a crisis, gold would not behav e in its normal manner. This is exactly what happened in September, 2001. Gold r esponded only sluggishly to the WTC events. The reluctance of Government to act is a recurring problem. Where oil and the Middle East are concerned, the word is \"do nothing to upset the oil companies.\" As far back as 1985, we brought to the attention of the Foreign Intelligence Ad- visory Board the emerging free energy paradigm. Our argument: We don't need Saudi Arabia or any other oil producing country. Le t's get out while we can. This was back in 1985! — and is on record.

There is more to come, much more. And this takes us well beyond the original topic of future technology. Our original task has broadened. The government is on the way to take over free energy technology; fuel cells are just th e start.

March 2002: Vol 13, No. 3 HIGH LEVEL GERMAN STATESMAN DISPUTES BUSH ON WTC AN D 9/11 ormer German Minister of Technology, Andreas von Bu elow makes more sense than Bush and the White House on WTC and 9/11. Von Buelow makes sense, but is almost totally ignor ed in the United states. He was the former Minister of Technology in Germany, an independent, sensible, down to earth thinker. It is now nearly four months since 9/11, and accord ing to general U.S. press articles, TV and radio reports, it is an unequivoca l but unproven fact that the WTC event of 9/11 was the sole work of an evil madm an — Osama bin Laden. Furthermore, we were promised an investigation, but all FBI investigative at- tempts have been blocked by the White House itself. Then, conveniently, the Enron scandal emerged. Look at this: Enron has cur- rently twelve Congressional investigations plus oth ers on the board. The tragic event of WTC has none — zero. Sure, Lay and his buddies ripped off millions, but someone was able to hijack four air planes, fly into New York landmark buildin gs, and kill a few thousand Americans. We spend billions of taxpayer dollars ea ch year to stop this kind of thing — but our defenses spend 75 minutes drinking coffee! Quite difficult to understand how a lone Arab who l ives in a cave with four wives is able to bring about this stupendous act of cooperation, and our technical efficiency is not discussed or investigated!

Our solution is simple: put Lay in jail, and put ou r effort into WTC - 9/11. Something over 90% of Americans reportedly support Mr. Bush and accept his neurotic pleas without question;yet, overseas, some very important questions and investigations are in progress. At home, Enron commands all attention, while an extremely important interview of Andreas v on Buelow appeared in the German daily, Tagesspiegel (January 13), with n ot one whisper in the U.S. And the topic is untouched, not only by the vast Am erican Press, but also by Congressional investigators. Here is one key point from von Buelow: \"I can expla in what's bothering me: I see that after the horrifying attacks of Sept. 11 , all political public opinion is being forced into a direction that I consider wrong .\" Some people in the U.S. feel the same way, but ther e is little coverage and few commentators even raise a hint that something is mi ssing here. Mr. von Buelow's views are important, not only by v irtue of his former position, but also because his views match a few publicized i n the United States. FTIR and the La Rouche people have expressed skepticism abou t the official monopoly view. We sense that many others have unexpressed skeptici sm, confusing the office of the President with the contemporary office holder. In your mind, go back and look at how Mr. Bush came to occupy this office — courtesy of Enron — and consider how he can raise over 90% approval on the basis of a PR campaign with no evidence to supp ort the claim. The level at which Bush discusses Osama bin Laden i s sophomoric. This dis- cussion of an evil, seemingly uncatchable Osama is becoming ridiculous. We need some solid answers to some solid questions, and we are not getting them. To remind you, 3000 citizens get wiped out, a nd the limit of our knowl- edge is — evil madmen. Then we have absurd CIA statements from CIA Directo r George J. Tenet that this event was a victory for the United States ! — nonsense! WTC was no victory. But all we get is amateurish, unproven accusations and claims of victory. The next thing we know, we shall have vict ory parades on the White House lawn! The establishment press is little better.

The y reflect what some of us have long known. Basically, the problem stems fr om overwhelming greed in the political/economic system. Greed has brought Ar gentina to its knees, greed has brought Zimbabwe to the brink of starvation, an d the results of greed over common good are all too obvious now in the United S tates and in the White House. Lay was the biggest subscriber to the Bush e lection, and also a major donor to Prince Charles in England — a mere $1.4 mi llion for Charles. Lay was buying everyone who could be bought. The Russians a dopted this anything goes philosophy at the Olympics — but too late in the da y. They were caught! We found this obeisance to corporate power in the H oover Institution at Stanford University 30 years ago. We understand 3/4 of the Senate and perhaps 1/2 of the Congress have received donations from Ke nneth Lay — all there, with their hands eagerly outstretched. So if an individu al who has not bought his way into the game wants protection, it is not there. Our personal case is the one we know best, and is v ery simple. Thirty years ago, we discovered something those in the industrial mil itary establishment did not want you to know. We were told not to publish this by the Hoover Institution at Stanford. They even quietly went through the galley s of one of my books to pull out the material on military aid to the Russians. W e refused to stay quiet, and wrote National Suicide and later The Best Enemy Mon ey Can Buy. We published the whole dirty story. We then found the Hoover Institution was maintained by private corporate donations, those who built the U.S.S.R. for profit — we found that our establish- ment actually built the Soviet Union while hypocrit ically claiming innocence, Just like Lay — \"I know nothing.\" Instead of thanks for our discovery, the establishm ent threatened and blustered to save its own skin and reputation. People like De an Rusk, Robert McNamara and Henry Kissinger lied and made sure enormous pre ssure was brought out to stop the story. Congress stood by and did nothing. They did not succeed, but thanks to the gullibility — and perhaps the greed of the Congressman in the street — there was enough pressure brought to silence Congress. Many years ago, after I would present a speech, sco res would come up and make statements, \"We are with you.\" \"God bless you. \" But that was all. We often wondered why — why people would stop at that point, and never go beyond empty words. We decided fear was the best explanati on. The fear system works. Almost everyone is accountab le to someone just upstairs - his or her boss. As former Senator Mike Mansfield said, \"To get along, you have to go along.\" But once you go along, you are c ommitted. You have limited your own freedom of action. What has happened is that many have limited their o wn freedom of action, and don't really want the greed-reward system to stop, because it has paid off for them.

Bush needs to check his history books when he ta lks about an \"axis of evil.\" For many, including most Europeans, \"axis of evil\" refers to the unholy alliance of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Mr. Bus h has invented a new axis — Iraq, Iran and North Korea. No matter that Iran a nd Iraq are enemies. No matter that Saudi Arabia is more and more apparentl y the seat of power for our problems. Fifteen of the nineteen hijackers were Sa udi. The Saudi finance Al Queda and Saudis are highly uncooperative. Why doesn't Bush include Saudis? Politics again. Bu sh is buddy-buddy with Saudi Arabia for family and oil reasons, and refuses to s ee any evil in that direction. Mr. Bush now has two major problems: 1. Get off the Osama kick, and tell us who was respons ible for the World Trade Center bombing. \"Condi\" (Condoleezza. Rice, P resident George W Bush's National Security Advisor) should remind him that a ssumption is not proof. 2. His \"axis\" is pure fabrication. There is no \"axis\" among these countries, except in his own imagination for his own purposes. More and more, Bush sounds like one of his fraterni ty buddies in Skull & Bones. T ENET AND BIN L ADEN ow CIA Director George J. Tenet is claiming a victo ry for September 11th. That's about as far as you can stretch imagination!

Is it the CIA' s job just to look at terrorism, say, \"My, my!\" and go back to sleep? Tenet is implying that in five years, the agency co uld not find a way into the Osama group. To FTIR, that is a blunt admission of failure. It is the job of intel- ligence agencies to find a way in. That is what \"op erations\" does. To add to Tenet's advantages, the Bush family and m any others have inside contacts with Saudi Arabia. No, Mr. Tenet — not vic tory, but downright failure. Excuses won't do it. At $30 billion a year, we need more. THE VON BUELOW APPROACH 1. \"There are 26 intelligence services in the U.S.A . with a budget of $30 billion (more than the total German defense budget) and they were not able to prevent the attacks.\" (FTIR has pointed out the same statistic. We now fi nd the CIA knew 10 days before the attacks, and did nothing. This $30 billi on is in addition to a secret budget we understand to be at around $70 billion.) 2. \"Then the U.S. immediately went to war ... but a Government which goes to war must first establish who the attacker, the enemy is. It has a duty to provide evidence, the U.S. has not been able to pre sent any evidence that would hold up in court.\" (FTIR makes a similar point. Bush has made an assum ption, he has not pre- sented evidence. 3. \"The assumed chief terrorist is Mohammed Atta. T his presumed terrorist then took some unusual risks ... and professionals do not take unusual risks. He catches a plane to reach Boston just a short time b efore the connecting flight. None of the stated terrorists was on the passenger list. None went through pre-flight procedures.

WHAT YOU MAY SUSPECT IS TRUE AND IS NOW IN PROGRESS BE WARNED ometimes surprises hit when least expected. This is certainly true in research. In February 2002, we had a letter from an internati onal, award-winning New York film maker, Roland Legiardi-Laura, current ly making a film on John Taylor Gatto, the New York City and State Teacher o f the Year. The film is en- titled The Fourth Purpose. 115 S"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY In making the film, Roland had noted references to our book, America's Se- cret Establishment. These came from Gatto's fourth book, Underground History of American Education. (In case you need it, Roland 's address is: The Odyssey Group, 269 East 8th Street, New York, NY 10009.) Legiardi Laura in particular had noted references i n our book (a book he de- scribes as \"extraordinary\") to Thomas Gallaudet, fo under of Gallaudet College (for the deaf) in Washington, DC. A book by Gallaud et has apparently been expurgated. We have a photo of the title page, whic h proves the book did indeed exist, but Legiardi-Laura was unable to obtain a co py for the film. Legiardi-Laura mailed me a copy of Gatto's book, an d we found numerous ref- erences to a member of the Illuminati, a secret soc iety, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (1746 - 1827), a close friend of Heinrich Hebart, t he founder of so-called \"en- riched\" education in the U.S. An odd combination. A Swiss Illuminati works closely and for some years lived with the American founder of the much-criticized domestic educational system in primary schools. Legiardi-Laura achieved accidentally what so many h ave attempted. He found a way into the secret society octopus that threatens to extinguish our way of life. This gives us an enormous research problem, and all we can do at the moment is present it to you. You are going to either solve it or let everything we have go to pieces. I cannot be any more clear than that. What you cannot do is what happened 30 years ago wh en we discovered how the Soviet Union was built by the United States. Pe ople made all kind of sup- porting noises, but when it came down to doing some thing, they walked away and allowed a few to shoulder the burden. Then the Soviet Union collapsed. The Soviet chess piece was simply removed from the boar d, and today is replaced by \"terrorism.\" For a number of reasons, this \"I see nothing\" evasi on tactic is not going to work this time around. This time, you either do som ething, or believe me, you will go under. I can't be any more blunt. A NEW THEORY AND A HYPOTHESIS FOR INVESTIGATION America's Secret Establishment is based on a genuin e membership list of Skull and Bones, which is tied in with the older Illumina ti secret society. When viewed side by side with Gatto's book, Underground History of American Education, a dramatic picture emerges. Briefly, you have already been conditioned to accep t secret society world control through the much-criticized educational system. Som e of us have evaded this mechanism, because we did not receive our primary e ducation in the United States. We evaded the conditioning. What we see cle arly may not be available to you.

This is what Gatto has unknowingly discovered — a vital step in this plan for world domination. The President of the United States George W. Bush is a member of Skull and Bones. WHAT PRIMARY EDUCATION DOES s many parents have already found, the American pri mary education system has less to do with the development of the individu al child, but rather prepares the child to be a cog in the State apparat us. This child conditioning can be looked at in two ways: • First, the child is being raised as a tool of the State; barely able to read, and full of unnatural and non-educational ideas. • But second, this conditioning can be viewed as a device to make a New World Order more acceptable. The kid grows up to be a pli ant zombie. This was not the Gatto objective. He started out by criticizing the educational objective. A teacher who was a real teacher, and ob jected to what is happening out there. Because of the Pestalozzi aspect, we see this diffe rently. We see a long-ranging conditioning objective to make the child accept the se deeply secret objectives. This is what the statistics portray. Just look at t he literacy rate. Back 150 years ago, literacy was universal. Is it 100% in the U.S. today? Maybe 60% of the popu- lation can read! This is what we spend billions upo n? — Something is wrong. WHAT IS TO BE DONE? First let's complete the Odyssey film on the educat ional system. This needs your help. This portrays a ridiculous affair. We sp end billions — on what? — kids who can't read?

Five days a week for drumming! No history, no Constitution, no literature, no scie nce — but drumming! Our conclusion was, shut this place down fast. This is not a school; it's an entertainment center. This conditioning has been going on for well over 1 00 years. If it is not stopped, now, we shall have the entire population, except fo r immigrants, ready-made for the New World Order. We have noticed that quite often the immigrant (the re are 50 million of them) or the well-traveled American has evaded the condit ioning.

Our skepticism is based on logic and comm on sense, up to now without evidence. We now have evidence, which more or less confirms w hat at least some have already deduced. As we stated last month, times have changed; you ig nore today at your own peril. Our doubts based on common sense were: 1. Mr. Bush claimed the culprit as an evil bin Laden. Not one piece of evidence was submitted. Bush jumped up and down, pointing a finger at bin Laden, and, according to reports, convinced over 90% of the dum bed down American public without a shred of proof. 2. Congress has over twelve investigations for the Enr on case — and NONE for the WTC case. Just as we went to press, two com mittees were appointed — the House committee has a narrow focus. Chairman is Congressman Porter Goss, former CIA operations! Senate Chairman is Jos eph Lieberman, with a wider scope. Think about this. Is the death of 3,00 0 Americans so insignificant that it can be brushed under the rug? Do the misdee ds of Kenneth Lay warrant twelve investigations, and the deaths of nearly 3,0 00 innocent Americans war- rant no investigation? Our conclusion: Congress doesn't want to investigat e; maybe it fears some of the information below (and in following issues) is true , and will become public. But Congress is supposed to represent the people! 3.

CNN and Rense.com (at: http://www.rense.com/generall9/forme rgerman.htm); print the passenger lists for the four planes involved in the World Trade Center disaster. (More specifically, we routinely checked for Arab n ames — there are none (one possible). However, the FBI has given us Arab names for the hijackers without aliases. These names are not on any passenger manif est we have seen. What is the reason for this contradiction? There is much more proof of an alternative explanat ion. The four American planes were hijacked by NORAD — i.e., U.S. Air Forc e, using remote control technology designed to rescue hijacked planes — not to fly them into buildings. This is the story coming out of Britain and Germany . Is this why Britain — always a stout U.S. ally — re fused to send 25,000 troops to Afghanistan? Is this why Germany refused to take over peace keeping in Kabul after Britain exits? We will give you references next issue (June) where you can read the full ver- sion for yourself.

There are rumors this information will be expurgate d. What you do after that is our business. From our perspective, we trust non e of the above. Approximately 10,000 people, probably a lot more, k now this story, and we are skeptical of a variant — the Chinese version. Their interest is to destabilize the U.S. Our starting point is: 1. You are not fully dumbed down. 2. Washington is unwilling to tell you the truth. 3. We pick up rumors that this same Washington is frig htened that you will somehow learn the truth. 4.

The Bush family — and several allied families — are at the core of a secret society known as The Order. They are sworn t o conceal its objectives. Even its very existence. Three in the Bush family are members. Here is an ex tract from the member- ship \"Catalogue\" of this secret society listing the \"Bush\" entries. BUSH, '48, George Herbert Walker-Grove Lane, Greenw ich, Conn.

BUSH, '17, Prescott Sheldon-( Finance-59 Wall St., New York City; res., Grove Lane, Greenwich, Conn. Member, Yale Corporati on, 1944-; Capt., F.A., World War I (A.E.E). Prescott Sheldon Bush, father of Vice-President Geo rge Herbert Walker Bush, was initiated into The Order in 1917 along with Henry N eil Mallon, founder of Dresser Industries (an important supplier of strategic high technology to the Soviets). After graduation from Yale both Prescott Bush and H enry Mallon were com- missioned into the U.S. Army, Field Artillery. As instant Captains, they were assigned (or perhaps rewarded) regiments as follows: Captain Prescott Bush 322d Regiment Field Artil lery Captain Henry Mallon 323d Regiment Field Artille ry Readers of Introduction to THE ORDER will recall th at \"322\" and \"323\" are room numbers in the \"Bones\" Temple on the Yale campus. After World War One Prescott Bush joined W.A. Harri man (now Brown Broth- ers, Harriman) private bankers at 59 Wall Street, N ew York, to start a forty-year career with the firm. Brothers Averell Harriman ('1 3), Roland Noel Harriman ('17) and members of the Brown family are also memb ers of The Order. In 1921 Bush married Dorothy Walker, daughter of St . Louis banker George Herbert Walker, whose son Stoughton Walker was init iated in 1928. Walker also hired James Smith Bush (initiated 1922), brother of Prescott Bush into his bank, the Industrial Bank of St. Louis. In brief, the Bush family is part of the tightly wo ven inner core of The Order, a secret society whose members are sworn to avoid d iscussion of objectives and membership — or even its very existence. 122 T"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"T ONY ' S N EWSLETTERS G EORGE H ERBERT W ALKER B USH eorge Bush was born June 12,1924, in Milton, Massac husetts. His childhood was spent in Greenwich, Connecticut and Phillips Exeter Academy, Andover. During World War Two — and this is one of the few positive aspects of Bush's career — he spent three years in the Pacific with Naval Air Services, leaving as a Lieutenant Junior Grade. Then, according to Current Biography. On his return to civilian life, Bush entered Yale U niversity where he majored in eco- nomics, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and joined De lta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. Nowhere in this biography — nor in any other Bush b iography — is initiation into the order cited. Membership is consistently co ncealed from the public record. Moreover, suppression of this membership is consist ent with the oath of ini- tiation which forbids members to discuss membership or even be present when The Order is discussed by outsiders. After Yale, Bush decided to go to work. According t o Current Biography: After graduating from Yale ... Bush decided to stri ke out on his own rather than work for his father's banking firm (Brown Brot hers, Harriman) and took a job as a salesman with Dresser Industries of Odes sa, Texas, an oilfield supply company of which his father was a director. One interesting point about Dresser Industries: it has always been a supplier of top flight high technology to the Soviets— some wit h more than obvious military applications. Even President Carter — who was actua lly tougher on holding the technological export line than President Reagan — a llowed a Dresser-Soviet contract to go forward in 1977 against the protests of the Department of Defense. A MBASSADOR B USH A T U NITED N ATIONS n 1970 Bush ran for the U.S. Senate from Texas. He lost. President Nixon then appointed Bush U.S. Ambassador to United Nations. This appointment was widely criticized as a politic al pay-off-because Bush had absolutely no experience whatsoever in foreign affa irs or diplomacy. This deficiency led to expulsion of Taiwan from the U.N. General Assembly and a seat for Communist China. Simultaneously Bush used his U.N. office to support \"Mundialization,\" i.e., the adop- tion by individual communities of world status. Par t of local taxes goes to support United Nations rather than the local community. It is a re jection of U.S. sovereignty. The first U.S. city to join the New World Order was Richfield, Ohio (November 1970). Here's part of a letter sent by U.N. Ambassa dor Bush to Richfield, Ohio: Permit me to congratulate you and the other members of your community on your Proclamation of Mundialization.

Equally significant is your community's comm itment to help increase understanding among the peoples of the world for wi thout that understanding peace among peoples can never be achieved. What a p rofound contribution Richfield is making to man's greatest efforts to bu ild a world in which all the pledges of the UN Charter will truly govern relatio ns among nations! Mr. Bush had sworn an oath of office to support the Constitution of the United States. He cannot support any measure that would in any way dilute the sovereignty of the United States. The \"Mundialization\" process and the Constitution of the U.S. are opposed to each other. They are mutually e xclusive. You have to choose one or the other. You can't support both simultaneo usly. After this Bush was moved along the fast track by N ixon and Ford: • 1971-2 U.S. Ambassador to United Nations • 1973-4 Chairman Republican National Committee • 1974-5 Chief U.S. Liaison Office, Peking, Communist China • 1976-7 Director, Central Intelligence Agency In 1980 Bush ran for President. Financial backing c ame heavily from the so-called Eastern Establishment-not only did David Rockefelle r send the maximum allow- able contribution of $1,000, but so did five other Rockefellers. Among members of The Order who backed Bush were: • J. Richardson Dilworth ('38) (Administrator of the Rockefeller family) $1000 •John Cowles, Jr. (four Cowles in The Order) $1000 • George Weyerhaeuser $1000 As you know, Bush ended up on the Presidential tick et with Reagan — and made it into the White House.

(and therefore) would be less apt to misread the intentions of the United States. The Bush assessment was that Andropov was misunders tood and really wanted to improve U.S.-Soviet relations. And what did Phoenix Letter print at that time (Jan uary 1983 The Russian Window)? As follows: Andropov is by far the most dangerous Soviet leader since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Andropov has more education than Lenin, and probabl y equals Lenin's cun- ning. Andropov is as ruthless as Stalin, but this r uthlessness will be directed as much at the Free World as long suffering Russians. In the light of history Kruschev and Brezhnev will be seen as toothless tigers compa red to the Andropov regime. In brief: KGB efficiency and terror will now be fel t inside and outside Russia. The \"poor misunderstood\" Andropov acted — in quick succession came these terror strikes: • The attempted assassination of the Pope, traced bac k to Moscow, • The massacre of KAL 007, • The massacre of the South Korean cabinet in Bangkok , • The Beirut Marine massacre, • The Cuban-Soviet buildup on Grenada — aimed at revo lution in Brazil. Bush boasts he spent a year as head of CIA. He shou ld buy a subscription to The Phoenix Letter— then his assessment of inten tions will be 100% more accurate.

Reading extracts from the speech Bush made in Harar e (capital of Zimbabwe) readers will understand why Bush may not have been anxious for domestic U.S. coverage of his views on Zimbabwe. Back in May of this year we reported that Robert Mu gabe was engaged in a quiet slaughter of his tribal enemies in Zimbabwe . .. while the U.S. was financ- ing Zimbabwean housing projects at lower interest r ates than could be obtained by American citizens.

H ere are some of the fawning statements made by Bush at a State Dinner held in H arare, Zimbabwe on No- vember 16, 1982: Your excellency ... thirty-one hours ago in Moscow, I discussed my mission to Africa with the President of Pakistan, Zia Al-Hu k. When I mentioned Prime Minister Mugabe, President Zia made reference to so mething which informed men everywhere on earth agree .... I want to acknow ledge that I stand in the pres- ence of a genuine statesman, the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe. His stature in the world is well established, highl y respected, and it will be more formidable in the years to come .... And more, Mr. Prime Minister... you have faced awesome challe nges... I do want to say on behalf of the Reagan Administration that we support the policy of reconciliation to which you have committed yourself... We have suppor ted your country because its success is consistent with U.S. principles and U.S. interests... shortly after President Reagan took office my government pledged nearly one quarter of a billion U.S. dollars in new aid. America has not only avowed its faith i n Zimbabwe, but proven it. Finally, Bush couldn't resist commenting on his res ponse to Andropov's sucker bait: A moment ago I mentioned our journey to Moscow. No doubt you have all seen photographs of Secretary Brezhnev's funera l. The image that struck me most — one that I will never forget — was the magni ficent, stately display of young Russian soldiers. And there's more of the same preppie gee-whiz juven ile ramblings ... this is the Vice President of the United States — once they let him outside the U.S. Now let's come up to date— to November 1, 1983, a f ew days before we go to press. Over in Harare, statesman Robert Mugabe has seized and imprisoned Bishop Abel Muzorewa of the American-based United Methodis t Church. What is Bishop Muzorewa's sin? Two days before Mugabe stormtroopers seized the bis hop, Muzorewa made a comment that human oppression in Zimbabwe was wor se than under white minority rule (Zimbabwe was formerly Rhodesia). Thi s is how Bishop Muzorewa phrased his criticism of Mugabe: I continue to hope and pray that God can somehow he lp us to be delivered from the oppression of today imposed on us not by I an Smith, not by Israel or 126"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"T ONY ' S N EWSLETTERS South Africa and not by people with white skins, bu t by our ruling party and government with black skins. Bishop Muzorewa is today held in Harare Central Pol ice Station. Muzorewa has not been formally charged with a crime. He cannot r eceive visitors or a lawyer. And the man responsible is Vice President Bush's he ro — distinguished states- man Mugabe — who is getting a one quarter billion d ollar hand-out this year from the United States taxpayer. C ONCLUSIONS 1. Mr. Bush is a member of a \"sordid\" secret society ( that's what one of its own members has called it). This membership has been co ncealed from the American rublic. It is obvious deception. 2. Mr. Bush apparently has some difficulty in making c orrect assessments of people and events. Anyone who provides rapturous su pport for such psychopaths Andropov and Mugabe has little understanding of tra ditional American values of freedom and human dignity. 3. These deficiencies have been identified by Andro pov. Soviet psychological profiles of Bush are accurate. Bush apparently cann ot restrain himself from reac- tion. Diplomatic precedence and goose-stepping mili tary parades are two Bush bairs which have succeeded. 4. Bush's actions confirm the conclusion of INTRODU CTION TO THE ORDER, i.e., that members of The Order have severe personality deficiencies. R ECOMMENDATION 1.

Vice President Bush now has a choice — deny members hip and so lie to the American people and betray his oath of office — or he can tell the truth, admit membership and betray The Order. At this time Patriarch Bush has opted to deny membe rship. In November 1983, a Phoenix Letter reader wrote the Vice President, request- ing him to respond to the charges made in The Phoen ix Letter.

This is a basic tenet of professional librarianship — in thirty years around the academic world we have never once known this rule v iolated. Even Soviet libraries by and large keep to this rul e. This editor's three-volume study of Soviet technology relied heavily on Soviet material (the U. S. govern- ment classified its files on this topic) and even t he paranoid Soviets were willing to ship abroad material listed in their Moscow cata logues. Now let's come to that bastion of free inquiry in N ew Haven, Connecticut, known as Yale University.

B USH -B AKER G ROUP C LOSE D OWN P LATFORM H EARINGS raditionally in election years the Republican Party holds nationwide public platform hearings. This year, White House counselor Edwin Meese (in ch arge of writing the platform) and almost all Republican officials, legi slators and Governors, wanted to continue the tradition. The Bush-Baker forces said no. Said James Baker, \"W hen you have the White House, why invite people to go out and criticize you.\" Then Trent Lott (R-Miss.) arranged a compromise — f our hearings only. In January, even this compromise was scuttled by the B ush-Baker crowd. We understand individual Republicans are now organi zing hearings on a local basis — in addition to the orchestrated show at Dal las. We also know from internal correspondence among mem bers of The Order (between their local cells or clubs) that they are worried — worried about the anti-elitist tide, worried that even Yale campus do esn't want them anymore. Someone needs to come up with an idea — how to get Vice President Bush on a public platform before nationwide TV cameras t o answer a few questions. For example: \"Are you or have ever been a member of a secret soc iety?\" \"Have you ever taken an oath to keep this membershi p secret?\" \"Did you declare this secret membership to the FBI or the Senate when you were confirmed as Vice President?\" CONCLUSIONS 1. George \"Poppy\" Bush is not only a member of a secre t society, but cannot deny this association. 2.

Bagg's century-old observations are fully supported by subsequent ACTIONS. A membership list for The Order — part of the Yale senior society system — is not freely available.

This is partially tru e. But nothing more than bare names of those initiated were ever published. All p rocedures and objectives are carefully guarded and always have been. In the past few decades secrecy has been extended e ven to names — as Daly admits. Daly states publication was \"discontinued a few years back.\" In fact, it is almost a century since full lists were published to our knowledge, although we have not thoroughly researched this point. The reason for non-publication presented by Daly is lack of newsworthiness. If it is newsworthiness alone, then why is it impos sible to obtain a current list of members of Skull & Bones? Why is the catalogue trea ted as a state secret \"For eye only.\" We suggest the true reason for concealment is the p recise opposite, i.e., that the list is indeed highly newsworthy. A quick scan of the 1983 list reveals an extraordinary correlation between The Order and the \"powers that be\" in the United States. Furthermore, we have begun to print evidence of col lusion among members for specific objectives.

The KGB ended up in control of MI-6, thanks to Masonic \"Privacy.\" This, in spite of the fact that all British intelligence organization s refuse to recruit masons.

F RATERNAL O BJECTIVES A RE T HE K EY ___________________________________ oncealment of fraternal objectives is the key. Priv acy is only guaranteed and acceptable in a free society if the privacy is used for legitimate ends. Evidence is accumulating that Yale senior society p ower has been used for illegitimate ends. In the Phoenix Letter for Decemb er 1984, January and Febru- ary 1985 we demonstrated — with only preliminary ev idence — that the Yale senior society system has generated the architects of defeat in U.S. foreign policy. We demonstrated that members act jointly and consis tently to the disadvantage of the United States. Not only is membership concealed, but also objectiv es are concealed and members are under oath not to discuss membership or objectives. We can deduce objectives from the actions of these blood brothers. Joint actions are the indicator and result of intentions. Joint actions are the proof of intentions. Consider again, for example, the case of \"The Broth erhood\" in England as surfaced by Stephen Knight. The KGB infiltrated and manipulated British freemasonry to control British intelligence organiz ations. Yet British Freema- sons claim a right to privacy. They are indeed enti tled to privacy if their ends are legitimate and if they take precautions against misuse of privacy. But in England freemasonry was used for illegitimate ends. Privacy is used as a reason to hide perverted, illegal, socially harmful action s totally unacceptable in a free society. In three issues of the Phoenix Letter we outlined j oint use of power in the United States by members of Yale senior societies. These actions were to the disadvantage of the United States. We have so far o utlined only 8 events. In fact, we have — even at this early stage — another 20 events ready to lay before you, including control of the Manhattan Project, ta rget selection in World War Two, the Alger Hiss case, and a wide range of other situations.

Under certain circumstances other Ivy League g raduates or outsiders with specific qualifications have priority over Yale gra duates. 4) Other Ivy League Universities, especially Harva rd, Princeton and Johns Hopkins (5) Families of (1) and (2) above (6) Outsiders with specific qualifications For example: President William Howard Taft (Club D. 76) appointed Franklin MacVeagh (Club D. 60) as his Secretary of Treasury and Henry Lewis Stimson (Club D. 86) as his Secretary of War. In brief: Taft's appointments were selected from ca tegory (1) above for two senior cabinet posts. But Taft appointed Theodore Marburg, German born, ( 6) above, as U.S. Ambassador to Belgium. Why? In 1911 Marburg was the prime exponent of the League of Nations idea and used the Belgian pos t to push this concept. The League of Nations concept is an event we can tr ace to The Order and its associates.

It's an extraordinary story — the Skull and Bones T emple at Yale is illegally holding the skull of Apache Chief Geronimo ... stol en from the grave by Senator Prescott Bush, father of President Bush, and other Bonesmen. The Apaches want the skull back... and under Connec ticut law (Section 53-334 of Offenses Against Public Policy and Title 45-253 of the State Probate Law) the hoding of human remains is illegal. New Haven lawyers, according to Altman, are relucta nt to sue or press for a civil or criminal complaint because of the power of Skull and Bones, to which we say \"wait a minute, this isn't Russia\" ... the l ocal prosecutor has a duty to prosecute if the evidence is credible. After all we live under the rule of law and that includes Presidents. If Mr. Bush is accessory to a criminal offense, apparently compounded by satanism, he has to be brought to the bar of justice. In this case George Herbart Walker Bush is apparently not implic ated directly except that he would have knowledge of illegal actions — which is indeed an offense.

K RIS M ILLEGAN ____________________ FEBRUARY 2001 A-THUNK! THE SOUND BROUGHT MY ATTENTION to the very building that brought me to New Haven in the first place, \"The Tomb,\" an expanded mausoleum, housing Yale's oldest senior secret society, The Order of Skull and Bones. Out came a young, serious coed leaving the building into the cold afternoon snowscape. That started me wondering, what hath the ladies wrought? What had been the effect of allowing females into that vener able male bastion? In 1991, the 15 outgoing members tapped 6 gals and 9 guys in early April as their replacements. Retribution came fast, the lock s were changed on the heavy doors at High Street and board spokesman Reverend S id Lovett (S&B 1950) declared, \"There was no election. There is no socie ty [next year].\" The \"disagreement\" caused more mainstream ink about the secret group s activi- ties than ever before. There were stories in Time, Newsweek and The Economist. Even People magazine ran a 2-page spread about the Bones tiff in May '91, while Bonesman GHW Bush (S&B 48) sat in the Oval Office . .. with no comment. Walking around today at Yale, one can see and feel a strong feminine pres- ence. Yale has been coed since 1969, the year after George W Bush (S&B 1968) graduated. By 1991 the undergrads were 45% female a nd a feeling on campus was that \"gender differences between friends of dif ferent sexes is not a dominant issue.\" The Bones crowd was, as Yale was by 1991, a diverse group of races, creeds and sexual orientation. Also the Tomb had become a bone of contention with feminists and there had been a break-in by some det ermined ladies, who took pictures and spread rumors. 143 K"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY The board had offered an early compromise of separa te his and hers secret societies but that was rejected by the then seniors , who went ahead, \"tapped\" the ladies and were locked-out of their High Street hid eaway. The \"locked-outs\" vowed to continue and they were s oon offered the use of another senior society's (Manuscript) secret clubho use. A then senior Bonesman contended, \"It makes sense to be co-ed because the world is co-ed.\" One view on the other side, a Patriarch DC lawyer, felt \"the admission of women would lead to 'date rape' in the 'medium-term future.'\" A vote-by-mail by Bones members produced a narrow v ote in favor of the admittance of the co-eds. The old guard cried foul, filed charges that the mail vote was against Bones by-laws and scuttled the Sep tember '92 plans to initiate the ladies. Finally in November a second vote was t aken, with members having to either appear in person or send a proxy by anoth er Bonesman, at the Tomb and another slim decision was made to admit the gal s. The 2000 senior group, outed by Rumpus, Yale's tabloid, included at least six women and maybe more. The Rumpus printed two different lists and some nam es could be either male or female. And it seems, judging from a list of Wolf H ead's members for the year 2001, that Wolf's Head, the last all-male senior se cret society at Yale, has also gone co-ed. What has been the effect? Do the women tapped for B ones follow the \"old guidelines\" of captains of ball teams, a Yale Lit e ditor, maybe a radical (for excite- ment?), some old-blood money with a few minorities tossed in now and then? Is there a new sexual element? What about the sexua l confession times? Is there a hot time on High Street now? Has the \"nude mud wr estling\" in the basement changed to \"playtime in the dungeon?\" Does the narr ow vote show a political change at stodgy Bones? Will Bones be taken-over by radical-Amazons? What hath the women wrought? \"My senior year, I joined Skull and Bones, a secret society, so secret I can't say anything more. It was a chance to make fourteen new friends.\" From the autobiography of George W Bush, A Charge t o Keep. According to recent lists released by Yale's tabloi d Rumpus, women are definitely here to stay at Bones. Women may actually revive some life and interest by students in the Order which was taking a beating from undergrads for its males-only stand. According to an article in the April 16, 1991, Hartford Courant: \"M y sense is that they get turned down these days more often than they get accepted,\" said Jacob Weisberg, a senior editor of the New Republic, who declined to become a Bonesman in 1985 when asked. \"There have been years lately when their whole first string has turned them down.\" Jacob even turned down a personal request from John Kerry to join Bones because \"he felt he could not join a club that excludes women.\" 144"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"S KULL & B ONES KRIS MlLLEGAN ______________________________________ ________ A PPEARED IN H IGH T IMES , J ANUARY 2000 \"These secret societies are behind it all,\" my fath er told me many years ago, During the early '50s he was a CIA branch chie f, head of the East Asia intelligence analysis office. \"The Vietna m War,\" he said soberly, \"is about drugs.\" Many years later I final ly had some understanding of what Dad was telling me.

BUSH IS THE THIRD GENERATION of Bush Bones men to become prominent in national politics. His father, President George H.W. Bush, joined S&B, in 1948. His grandfather, Prescot t Bush (S&B, 1917) was a senator from Connecticut, 1952-62, a partner in the Brown Brothers, Harriman investment-banking firm, and a director for CBS, Pa n Am and Prudential. He was one of President Dwight Eisenhower's favorite g olfing partners and a member of Washington's elite Alibi Club. But there was more to Prescott than met the resume. He had served as a US Army Intelligence liaison officer during World War I. Pr escott's boss, W. Averell Harriman (S&B 1913) worked closely with fellow \"Bonesman\" Se cretary of Defense Robert Lovett (S&B 1918) to organize US intelligence activ ities in the early Cold War. They created a framework to run covert operations and ps ychological warfare. In 1954, H.S. Richardson, the maker of Vick's cough drops and Vapo-Rub, wrote in a letter to Senator Bush; \"1 want to get your advic e and counsel on a subject — namely what should be done with the income from a foundati on, which my brothers and I are setting up.\" Eugene Stetson (S&B 1934), an assistant manager at Brown Brothers, Harriman, organized the H. Smith Richardson Foundation. It pa rticipated in MK-ULTRA, a secret CIA domestic psychological-warfare operation, and h elped to finance the testing of psy- chotropic drugs, including LSD, at Bridgewater Hosp ital in Massachusetts in the '50s. In the '80s, the Richardson Foundation was a \"priva te donors steering committee,\" working with the National Security Council to coord inate the Office of Public Diplomacy. This was an effort to provide money and cover for a rming the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, and to coordinate published attacks on opponents of the program. In 1962, Prescott founded the National Strategy Inf ormation Center, with his son, Prescott Bush, Jr. and future CIA director William Casey, an investment banker and veteran of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the CIA's predecessor. The center laundered funds for the dissemination of CIA-author ed \"news stories\" to some 300 newspapers. Gordon Gray, another of Prescott's golfing buddies, was Eisenhower's national se- curity adviser and first director of the Psychologi cal Strategy Board in the early '50s. Along with Averell Harriman and others, he created the modern wall of \"deniability\" for US covert actions, such as the overthrow of lef tist governments in Iran in 1953 and Guatemala in 1954. Gray's son C. Bowden Gray wa s President George Bush's White House counsel. As \"protector of the president , come what may,\" he helped to keep Bush \"out of the loop\" as George became embroi led in the evolving Iran-Contra scandal.

At this meeting Mallon, Prescott Bush and Dulles discussed the use of drilling rigs in the Caribbean. Dresser Industries had \"often provid ed cover employment to CIA operatives.\" In reaction to the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Vice P resident Richard Nixon and the National Security Council formed a working grou p — the \"5412 Committee.\" Members discussing \"plausible deniability\" and the option of assassinating Cuban lead- ers decided to use a third-party \"cut-out\" for the operation.The \"cut-out,\" code-named Operation 40, was mobster Santos Trafficante, who h ad plenty of reasons to want Castro gone — and any actions could easily be laid at his doorstep. And with ground- work already laid with the World War II mob/docks d eal and subsequent black-market activities in Italy, an informal financing arrangem ent between \"intel,\" the mob, assassins and arms, and drug trafficking was made. Zapata Off Shore, an offshore oil-drilling company headed by George Bush, provided a convenient cover.

One was named Houston, the other Barbara. They were Navy ships that has been repainted with new names.\" At t he time George Bush was living in Houston with his wife, Barbara. In July, 1988, The Nation published a memo from FBI Director J.

After Nixon resigned as President, his staff reveal ed that his code name for the assassina- tion of John Kennedy was that \"Bay of Pigs thing.\" One of the most important pieces of evidence in the assassination, Abraham Zapruder's f ilm, was purchased by Time, Inc., and locked in a vault. Time, Inc. was founded by Henry Luce (S&B, 1920). The Zapruder film got its first public screening af ter being subpoenaed by Judge Jim Garrison, who tried to prove CIA involvement in the killing.

Phi Beta Kappa was \"founded with impressive ritual and high solemnity\" on Thurs- day, December 5, 1776, at William and Mary College, in Williamsburg, Virginia. The chapter at William and Mary was disbanded in 1781, making the Yale branch, which was founded in November 1780, the oldest extant cha pter. Phi Beta Kappa became an \"open honorary organizatio n\" in 1832. In protest, ap- parently, Russell, Yale valedictorian of 1833, infl uenced Taft and 13 others \"to form what is now perhaps the most famous secret society in the United States.\" From the very beginning there was resentment from f ellow students. Faculty sent warning letters to early members' parents. But the chapter persisted and flourished, and by 1884 two other senior secret societies at Yale h ad been formed, Scroll and Key, and Wolf's Head. Also, Phi Beta Kappa was revived after disappearing in 1871. On September 29, 1876, the Order of File and Claw b roke into the \"Tomb,\" the windowless Bones-owned and built meeting house. The y wrote that they saw its walls \"adorned with pictures of the founders of Bones at Yale, and of the members of the society in Germany, when the Chapter was establishe d here in 1832.\" In the cellar, they found a small room, with an \"al ways-burning lamp\" and \"a dilapidated human skull.\" Upstairs, three rooms wer e found, a lodge room with its walls covered in black velvet, a table with skull a nd crossbones, and the \"sanctum sanctorum,\" furnished in red velvet.

He had built a house (now a museum) in Milton, Massachusetts (no t far from where former President George Bush was born).

The Chinese emperor would only receive Western amba ssadors as if they were tribute-bearing vassals, and in the highly str uctured social caste of China, merchants were not worthy of respect, let alone dis course at an official level. For many years dealings with Westerners were delegated to a few \"Hong\" merchants, who paid for the privilege and had to vouchsafe the foreigners' commercial dealings. The term \"pidgin\" English came from the H ong merchant pronunciation of the word \"business\" in the trade dialect of Engl ish that was used to conduct affairs with the \"white devils.\" Chinese High Commissioner Lin Tse-hsu came to Canton in 1839 with an order to \"investigate the port affairs.\" The first edict against opium had co me in 1729; another against smoking came in 1796. The trade had grown to 40,000 chests by 1838. Smoking, a novel, more soporific and addictive manner of using opium, plus the encouragement of the trade by the British and others, had devasta ted all segments of Chinese society.

T hrough threats, a servant walkout, giant gongs that were rung all night and o ther measures, he was able to collect over 20,000 chests of opium (about half of that year's Indian trade). Then, under orders from the emperor, he destroyed i t all. This sparked the first Opium War, made huge profits for those companies that had held on to chests, and left Russell & Comp any the only trading firm left open in Canton.

Soon there was a black market, and smuggling again began developing into a major force. Taft succeeded Roosevelt as President in 1909, and actively promoted federal legislation and international conven- tions to outlaw and \"control\" certain drugs. These international treaties helped to break down judicial reluctance, and brought claims of the extraconstitutional force of interna- tional treaty obligations into the enabling of US drug laws — thus creating a profitable prohibition. And entangled in many of the recent nexuses of smug glers and spies is George H.W.

Unraveling the King Air's tangled and colorful hist ory first requires a look at the year the plane came into service ... 1982 was a momentous year. The plane was spanking-new. And President Reagan had just introdu ced \"Project Democracy,\" which he called a \"crusade for freedom.\" It became, instead, a license to steal. Here's how it started .... The detonations rumbled along the rocky course of t he Rio Negro in Nicaragua throughout the night of March 14,1982. Concrete bridges groaned under their own weight, an d came crashing in ava- lanches of dust in a dark landscape seen through ni ght-vision goggles. In certain quarters of Washington. D.C, it was time to uncork the champagne. War was breaking out in Central America. Two days later, Barry Seal took possession of the f irst of many planes supplied to him through CIA Director Bill Casey's \"off-the-book s\" Enterprise, a King Air 200. By March of 1982, more than 100 U.S. advisers were in Honduras. The chief of the Honduran Army, Barry's pal General Alvarez, said that his country would agree to U.S. intervention in Central America, if i t were — but of course!— the only way to \"preserve peace.\" Some Generals will say anything to make a buck. \"'Up to March 1982 you could still change your poli cy,\" recalled a member of the NSC later. \"The issue was still the question of support for El Salvador's 163"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY rebels. If that ended, so could pressure on Managua . But once the first forces of Nicaraguan exiles were trained and set in motion, a ny real negotiating became much harder. The blowing of the bridges was an anno uncement.\" Democrats, fearing that Reagan was pushing the US i nto another Vietnam- style quagmire throughout early 1982 tried to cut o ff aid to the contras. And at precisely this time — at the height of CIA Director Bill Casey's frenetic efforts to ward off these Congressional efforts — Barry Sea l acquired two brand new multi-million dollar Beech Craft King Air 200's. The ownership of the planes was deliberately obscur ed through convoluted transactions involving Phoenix-based corporations w hich we were \"fronts\" for Phoenix-based General John Singlaub's \"Enterprise.\" In early 1982 Singlaub had organized an American ch apter of the World Anti- Communist League (WACL), with a loan from Taiwan. S eal's King Air 200's came from sources close to these efforts. Jack Singlaub has a long history of involvement in covert operations, beginning with the World War II Office of Strategic Services (OSS). He served as CIA desk officer for China in 1949 — yet another China hand — and deputy station chief in South Korea during the Korean War. During Vietna m he commanded the Special Operations Group Military Assistance Comman d, Vietnam—Studies and Observation Group, deeply involved in the CIA's Ope ration Phoenix assassination program. Seal and Singlaub's covert efforts in 1982 were mad e necessary by the CIA's recent history. It had been forced, after the shock ing scandals of the 1970s, to make drastic reductions in \"official\" CIA capabilit ies in the Carter years. Until then, the CIA had controlled a huge network o f planes, pilots and companies for use in paramilitary situations. But a fter the public revulsion at disclosures of out-of-control CIA covert operations , many of these assets, like the infamous Air America, were dissolved or sold of f. The Contra war put everything back into high gear; the Reagan Adminis- tration sought to expand covert paramilitary operat ions in Central America and elsewhere. So the CIA and the Army jointly agreed to set up a special aviation operation called \"Seaspray,\" New York Times reporter Seymour Hersh revealed in 1987. And the Agency rebuilt its capabilities illegally, rely ing on assets like Barry Seal. This is old news to local and state police in areas , like Mena, affected by these extra-constitutional government operations. They mo re than most had seen the cynical manipulation of this operation to flood Ame rica with a river of drugs. When law enforcement authorities debriefed convicte d \"drug smuggler\" Seal in late 1985, one of the cops present brusquely beg an by stating, \"We already know about Seaspray.\" The spring of 1982 was an extraordinarily busy time . The boys were getting ready to go to war .... 164"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"T HE W AR OF '82 • CIA agent Dewey Clarridge put a proposition to Cont ra leader Eden Pastora. \"He would become the star of the second revolution as he had been the star of the first.\" • John Hull, whom Congressional sources said worked f or the CIA since at least the early 1970s, rented a contra safe house in San Jose , Coast Rica at CIA request. • Retired Air Force General Richard Secord began mana ging an operation in which Israel shipped weapons captured in Lebanon to a CIA arms depot in San Antonio, Texas, for re-shipment to the contras. • Felix Rodriguez drew on his Vietnam experience and wrote a proposal for the creation of an elite mobile strike force that would be \"ideal for the pacification efforts in El Salvador and Guatemala.\" • Medellin Cartel money man Ramon Milian Rodriguez be gan to launder, at Felix Rodriguez' request, $10 million from the cart el for the Contras.

Between March and December 1982, according to law e nforcement records and Seal's own archives, Barry fitted nine of his a ircraft with the latest electronic equipment, paying the $750,000 bill in cash...remin ding us of an old Saturday Night Live gag about Chico Esquela, a clueless Latin ball payer, changed only slightly: \"National security been berry berry good to me.\" Early in 1982 a new cover unit of the Armed Forces was also set up. Known as the Intelligence Support Activity (ISA), it became a separate entity in the Army's net world of special operations, with its own comma nder, Col. Jerry King. The secret operation ferried undercover Army operatives to Honduras where they trained Honduran troops for bloody hit-and-run oper ations into Nicaragua. The Army went to outside businessmen and arms deale rs to make off-the- books airplane purchases, with funds that had been \"laundered\" through secret Army finance offices at Fort Meade. $325 million was appropriated for this Special Oper ations Division of the Army between 1981 and the autumn of 1983. Through private front companies like the ones which supplied Barry Seal with his fleet of smuggling aircraft, Operations Seaspra y and Yellow Fruit ferried weapons like rapid-fire cannons to CIA operatives busily mi ning Nicaragua's harbors. 165"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY All of this was in violation of Congressional legis lation barring the Defense Department and the Agency from any action aimed at overthrowing the Sand- inistas. More importantly, they ignored the manifest wishes of the American people, who strongly rejected war with puny Nicaragua. Acco rding to a 1987 New York Times report by Seymour Hersh, had these operations become public, they would almost certainly have caused enormous damage to the Reagan Administration. But that's why God made Special Forces...or so, at least, goes the rationale. Whatever the reason for the Central American war, S eal's drug enterprise grew to become a truly formidable 'funding engine.' Vast fortunes were made, covertly, during the 1980' s...and these are some of the people who made them, giving them a 'leg up' in achieving the coveted distinction of being 'global oligarchs.' Seal's planes flew from Mena to airstrips in the mo untains of Colombia and Venezuela. After making a refueling stop in Panama or Honduras, they would return to Mena. En route, the planes would drop par achute-equipped duffel bags loaded with cocaine over Seal-controlled farms in L ouisiana... . \"His well-connected and officially-protected smuggl ing operation based at Mena accounted for billions in drugs and arms from 1982 until his murder four years later,\" said Dr. Roger Morris and Sally Denton in P artners in Power. They reported that coded records of the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) showed Barry Seal on the payroll beginning in 1982. The effects of the Barry Seal-directed efforts to t ake weapons one way and bring drugs the other soon began to become visible, in ruined lives in the U.S. and maimed bodies in Central America. \"My investigation established a conspiratorial peri od, chronologically, with a first overt act and a last overt act. The first ove rt act was April 12, 1982,\" stated Arkansas state criminal investigator Russell Welch. Of course, Seal's operation was not alone. When pri vate planes began to bomb the Nicaraguan capital, resulting in the crash of a Cessna 404 at the Managua air- port, an account of how three Cessna's were secretl y transferred from the New York Air National Guard to Central America for the raid on Managua leaked out. Custody of a number of planes moved from the U.S. A ir Force to a top-secret Joint Chiefs operation code-named \"Elephant Herd,\" and then on to the CIA, through a Delaware company where they were first ar med and then transferred to the Contras. This company, Summit Aviation, was doing business w ith Barry Seal, proved by records in his widow's possession. According to con gressional sources, Summit did \"contract\" work for the CIA, had former CIA personn el on the payroll, and had been linked through ownership records to the Cessna that crashed while bombing Managua. And the downed Cessna's ownership records were equa lly as convoluted as were Barry Seal's King Air's. The 'fake paper' desk was doing a crackerjack job... . 166"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"T HE W AR OF '82 The Cessna was purchased by Summit in October 1982 from Trager Aviation Center in Lima, Ohio. They covered their tracks on the same day, selling it to In- vestair Leasing Corp. of Mclean, Va.

Foley, Su mmit's \"military director,\" a Seal associate whose name and number are in Barry's files. In addition to work for Investair, Summit maintaine d and modified planes for Armairco, another company involved in covert Govern ment projects. Armairco, organized in 1982, also bought several multimillion -dollar Beechcraft King Airs like Seal's, purchased directly from Beech in a pro cedure used only for military projects, according to Beech officials and aviation experts. They were all, in other words, mil-spec planes. When asked whether Armairco's government work inclu ded activities in Central America, an Armairco official said, \"That may well be.\" The convoluted paper history of the airplane which once belonged to Barry Seal, and which was until recently the favorite pla ne of George W. Bush, begins when the title to the new aircraft was first record ed by Portland, Oregon, dealer Flightcraft, Inc, in early 1982. Flightcraft's President, David Hinson, a former mil itary and commercial airline pilot active in the Republican Party in Oregon, at the time was, according to The Oregonian, under consideration to head the FAA. The paper stated Hinson met with Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole to exp ress interest in the job, even travelling to Washington to promote himself for the post. Helping Bill Casey subvert the will of Congress and the American people pre- sumably did nothing to hurt his chances .... The King Air, N6308F, was spoken for even before it arrived at Flightcraft's facilities ... FAA records show a defunct Lake Arro whead, California firm entered into leasing agreements with developer Eugene Glick in February of 1982, two months before the manufacturer's title was transfer red to Flightcraft. On paper the plane was 'owned' by a Greyhound Bus L ines subsidiary, Grey- cas, which in turn leased it to a mysterious Phoeni x firm close to John Singlaub's Enterprise operations named Systems Marketing, Inc. AP reporter Bryson Hull reported to us recently tha t some digging had revealed that Systems Marketing was a wholly-owned subsidiar y of yet-another company, called... Military Electronics. Can you say \"Iran Contra?\" (We knew that you could. ) Military Electronics, through its cutout, Systems M arketing, then leased the plane to Continental Desert Properties, a firm owne d by Gene Glick .... In the final step, Glick turned the plane over to B arry Seal. Insurance policies found in Seal's private papers confirm that he sign ed for an insurance policy on the aircraft. What was the purpose of this convoluted ownership? What was it designed to conceal? 167"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY The answer lies in the very definition of \"tradecra ft,\" a term for what it is that spies and covert operators do: operate in the dark. The 'front' companies were in place to act as \"cut-outs,\" layers of insulation, b etween the spy agency, in this case Bill Casey's CIA, and the covert operative, in this case, Barry Seal. Gene Glick lived in the exclusive Hope Ranch, very near Ronald Reagan's Rancho Del Cielo Ranch in Santa Barbara, California . He leased not just this but several other Barry Seal's planes and helicopte rs as well, during the time Seal was most active in drug and weapons smuggling. Other documents we uncovered revealed that Glick wa s also actively helping Seal purchase ocean-going vessels, for use in drug smuggling activities, and as stationary platforms for the CIA to use off the coa st of Nicaragua. FBI agent Del Hahn, who had dismissed Glick's impor tance to us, had instead fueled our suspicions. \"He's just a money launderer,\" said Hahn, Special A gent in Charge of an Inter- Agency Organized Crime Drug Task Force looking into Barry Seal's organization in the mid-'80s. Not quite, Delbert .... He was a cut-out. The circle was completed when we discovered that th e Beech King Air, as well as several others used by Barry Seal, had been in reality owned all the time ... by the CIA, through the company revealed in 199 8 bankruptcy proceedings to have owned Southern Air Transport (SAT). Souther n Air was owned by an entity called Finova, which was disclosed when no o ne was looking when SAT went into bankruptcy in 1998. Southern Air is a legendary CIA proprietary—second only to Air America — con- nected to Secord, Singlaub, Rodriguez, Casey and Vi ce President George Bush. The company that supposedly 'owned' Barry Seal's Ki ng Air's is an Agency front, set up in Arizona and headquartered in Canad a to escape American financial disclosure requirements. Among its dubious achievements Southern Air owned t he C123 used by Seal in the Nicaragua sting operation; the same aircraft that was later shot down over Nicaragua in 1986. When lone survivor Eugene Hasenf us was captured by San- dinistas, it had precipitated what became known as the Iran-Contra scandal. Back then, no one knew — or admitted knowing — just who owned Southern Air Transport, although Government officials swore up and down that it wasn't the CIA. On June 14, 1984, after passage of the second Bolan d Amendment and the consolidation of Contra operations under Oliver Nor th, the plane was sold twice in one day, first to a Morgan B. Mitchell of Vale, Oregon, and then to Chevrolet Dealer Merrill Bean of Ogden Utah, who curiously ga ve the Dover, Delaware, address of the \"Prentis Hall Corporation\" on his FA A registration. Students of the CIA have long been aware of the age ncy's affinity for hiding its assets in Delaware corporations. But many other com panies do so for reasons of 168"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"T HE W AR OF '82 convenience. In an interview Bean stated that he ha d incorporated in Delaware as a legal necessity because of the needs of his in vestors. \"Delaware is a very convenient place for many kinds of corporations to in- corporate and many large corporations and multi-nat ionals do so,\" Bean said. \"Because other companies I was in partnership with were incorporated there I chose to do so also. It was much easier that way an d it was a requirement of the partners who were investing.\" A good answer. Unfortunately Delaware officials sta te that Bean's company, Prentis Hall, does not exist. And in the FAA record s connected to Bean's owner- ship of the plane there are other gaps in the FAA r ecords. When major mechanical repairs are made on an aircra ft, the mechanic is re- quired to complete an FAA form; in December 1989, a n FAA certified mechanic installed routine de-icing equipment on the plane, and, reviewing exact ownership documents, listed the owner as United Insurance of Ogden, Utah. Nowhere in FAA title paperwork does United Insuranc e appear as an owner. And a spokesman for the Utah State Department of In surance said there had never been a 'United Insurance' licensed to do busi ness in the State. So we took a closer look at Merrill Bean, and disco vered that he, too, had been involved in — what else? — major financial fraud, i n what The Salt Lake City Tri- bune called \"the worst financial disaster in Utah s ince the Great Depression.\" The disaster was the en masse failure of Utah thrif ts—hybrid financial insti- tutions that offered high interest rates and consum er loans—and the collapse of the insurance fund that was supposed to protect their deposits. And because Utah's thrifts were essentially uninsured, the fail ure of Bean's thrift left a trail of broken hearts and people. One example will suffice: \"We had just moved to Utah from California two year s ago,\" 58-year old Irene Culver told The Salt Lake City Tribune in 198 6. \"My husband Kent was an aircraft mechanic but he has Parkinson's disease. W e put half our savings in there (Western Heritage) and bought a little fixer-upper with the other half. When the state closed everything, we were ruined.\" We were going to put a new roof on and install a ga s furnace, because the elec- tricity's expensive. Now we can't do it, so we've g ot half the house closed off.\" Bean told us, \"I was Director of that failed Thrift . I came aboard when it was almost going under. And I poured some money int o it to try to save it and it didn't happen. I was hoping that my $75,000 that I put into it would help revive it.\" How does a savvy businessman with aircraft and car dealerships believe that $75,000 will turn around a failing Savings & Loan? The answer may be in \"The Mafia, The CIA and George Bush,\" where Texas journalist Pete Brewton documented how much of the S&L scandal was con- nected to illegal covert operations of the CIA.... 169"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY In many of those schemes a $75,000 or similar \"buy- in\" might have purchased a seat at a highly-lucrative but completely-crimina l feeding frenzy. The 'paper trail' of Barry Seal's King Air 200 reve aled other connections to the unsavory perpetrators of the major financial fr auds which — like the S&L scandal — marred the 1980s. The plane's ostensible 'owner,' Greyhound Leasing, or Greycas, for short, was also at the center of a huge and seemingly-inexplicable financial fraud which, like the half- trillion dollar S&L scandal, no one ever seemed too concerned about unraveling. The corporation was openly and eventually very publ icly looted. Afterwards, company management pretended to be \"baffled.\" It went down like this: Greycas Inc. and another Gr eyhound unit, Greyhound Leasing, were bilked out of over $75 million by She ldon Player, a Utah resident assumed to be in the machine and oilfield equipment sales business. He gained the money through fraudulently obtained loans from Greyhound. Obligingly, Greycas then devised an elaborate cover -up scheme to prevent disclosure of details about the losses, which eventually toppe d one hundred million dollars. It began with a $600,000 loan. Player would sell Gr eycas heavy machine tools, lease them back, and then pretend to sublease the e xpensive devices to end-users. In most cases the machines, collateral for the loan s, were non-existent. By 1984 Player had borrowed $8 million from Greyhou nd in the scheme. So he asked for $40 million in new loans to continue his transactions, and $23.5 million had been disbursed before the company got suspiciou s and confronted Player, telling him they wanted to inspect the machinery which they supposedly owned. Player resisted, leading some company executives — not in on the joke — to question the \"integrity of the transactions with Pl ayer.\" But, remember, this was a company controlled by CIA -front Finova. So de- spite the company's doubts about Player's credibili ty and integrity, and in spite of Greycas' inability to obtain inspections of the equipment, the company lent Player another $24 million in new loans! Anyone who has ever borrowed money for a car or hom e must admire the chutzpah of Sheldon Player, whom the business press took to calling an \"admitted con artist\" though he had no history of financial f raud that we could discover, which took place at the same time officers of a Swi ss-based subsidiary of the company were also massively defrauding Greycas, of another $120 million, in a (supposedly) unrelated scandal. \"Many borrowers failed to make even the initial mon thly payment,\" court documents stated, about this second scandal. The co mpany's accountants wrote that \"fraudulent and dishonest acts resulted direct ly in a loss of $119,684,598.\" Not so, said the company's hapless general counsel, responding weakly that the loss was a mere $72 million. The double looting was an Iran-Contra 'bust-out' wh ich left hapless shareholders holding the bag. The fraud included checks written as bribes on napkins in Swiss restaurants and then set afire, the reported possib ility that one of the participants 170"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"T HE W AR OF '82 was blackmailing the company, and angry lawsuits fi led by upset shareholders. But the real question, which puzzled business reporters were never able to answer, was: why were they were giving money away down at Greyho und during the 1980s? The criminal trial of Sheldon Player is an illustra tion of our thesis that being connected means never having to say you're sorry. W hen Player was sentenced, he received just a five-year sentence. That's just one year for each $13 million he stole. This is clearly a deal which, if offered to regular Americans, would have them lined up around the Phoenix Federal Courthouse to sign up. After receiving his 'draconian' sentence, Mr. Playe r was then given additional time to settle personal affairs before entering pri son, which, for Mr. Player, con- sisted of the Lompoc Camp, a minimum-security facil ity known as one of the \"country club\" institutions in operation around the nation, according to Dick Murray of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. Even funnier is what happened to the President of h apless Greycas. Robert Bertrand, lucky fellow, never went to prison. Inste ad he resigned at Greyhound in 1986, and was appointed new president and chief executive officer of Finalco, an equipment finance and brokerage company based in Mclean, Virginia. That's the home of the CIA, folks. Probably just coinciden ce. Completing the Barry Seal-to-George W. Bush plane c hronology, Merrill Bean sold the plane in May of 1990 to Corporate Wings of Salt Lake City, which flipped it two days later to Gantt Aviation of Georgetown, Texas, which a month later sold it to the State of Texas Aircraft Pool, where it resides today. Johnny Gantt, President of Gantt Aviation, said he probably knew that the State of Texas had a bid out when he acquired the p lane. At the time the Gov- ernor of Texas was Bill Clements.

Just after Hopsicker's book was in print, AP ran this official story. From: Corpus Christi Caller-Times (9/10/2000) TEXAS-OWNED PLANE ONCE OPERATED BY INFAMOUS DRUG RU NNER Colombia cartel paid Adler 'Barry' Seal a reported $1 million for each flight By C. Bryson Hull, Associated Press HOUSTON — The state of Texas flies a plane that ear ned its wings at the hands of famed drug smuggler, government operative and eventual assassi nation victim Adler \"Barry\" Seal. State officials have flown aboard N6308F, an 18-yea r-old twin turboprop that seats up to 10, on offici al business since Texas bought the plane in 1990. The Beech King Air is one of 53 in the state s fleet. Gov. George W. Bush took office five years after th e plane became Texas property and was unaware of it s history. \"We're glad to hear that the plane is on t he straight and narrow and has landed on the right side of the law,\" Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said. Airborne Smuggling Seal leased the N6308F seven years before Texas bro ught it to ferry government officials, according to an Associated Press comparison of Federal Aviation Administration records with insurance and leasing documents. In the early '80s, Seal was a top DEA informant by dint of his work as airborne smuggler for Colombia' s Medellin cartel. He earned a reported $1 million a flight, hauling guns south and drugs north. Seal, a former member of the Army's special forces and a one-time Trans World Airlines pilot, leased a nd operated the plane for at least a year, beginning o n March 21, 1983, according to a leasing document. B. Don Wineinger, who handled the insurance policie s for Seal while working for a Kansas insurance firm, verified his signature on the documents and a uthenticated the lease. Many Owners The plane's owner at the time is unclear. Leasing r ecords show the lessor as Continental Desert Proper ties Inc., a California real estate firm. But FAA title records show the owner to be Systems Marketing Inc. , a now-defunct Arizona computer leasing business. Continental Desert Properties owner Gene Glick has since died. The former owner of Systems Marketing was unavailable for comment. N6308F passed through five other owners before it c ame to the state, but belonged for most of the time to a Utah Chevrolet dealer named Merrill Bean. Of t he other owners, three were aircraft brokers and one was a leasing subsidiary of Greyhound Bus Lines called Greycas Inc. None, save Bean, owned the plane for more than 30 days. Violent Death The State of Texas Aircraft Pooling Board, which ow ns a fleet for use on official state business, purc hased N6308F in May 1990 from Gantt Aviation, a Georgetow n airplane broker. Seal, 46, was machine-gunned to death in the parkin g lot of a Baton Rouge, La., halfway house on Feb. 19, 1986. Three Colombians were sentenced to life i n prison for the killing, which occurred shortly before Seal was to testify in the Miami drug trial of Jorge Ochoa, a top Medellin cartel lieutenant. Medellin leader Pablo Escobar and Ochoa had offered $500,000 to have Seal killed and $1 million to have him brought back alive to Colombia, according to testimony at the trial. Iran-Contra Connection This is not the first time one of Seal's planes res urfaced in an unlikely place. In 1984, Seal flew hi s C-123K military transport plane, dubbed \"The Fat La dy,\" to Nicaragua on an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration sting operation. Using hidden cameras installed on the plane by the CIA, Seal snapped photos showing him taking bags of cocaine from Escobar and a corrupt Sandinista go vernment official. President Reagan later used the photos during a nationally televised plea for suppo rt for the Contras. But the plane that bore those public-relations frui ts eventually gave Reagan fits. \"The Fat Lady\" was shot down over Nicaragua in October 1986 while carr ying a load of weapons bound for the Contras. That crash and the Sandinistas' capture of the sole survivor, CIA operative Eugene Hasenfus, led to th e unmasking of the Iran-Contra scandal. 172"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"T HE S ECRET T REATY OF F ORT H UNT This under-appreciated article is for background in formation and as a help in understanding our current world.

Himmler's plan for dealing with the grim situation facing Nazism found its premise in Hitler's belief that the alliance betwee n \"the ultra-capitalists\" of the U.S. and \"the ultra-Marxists\" of the Soviet Union w as politically unstable. \"Even now they are at loggerheads,\" said Hitler. \"If we c an now deliver a few more blows, this artificially bolstered common front may sudden ly collapse with a gigantic clap of thunder. 5 Himmler believed that this collapse would occur an d that the U.S. would then consider the formation of a new ant i-Soviet alliance with Nazi Germany. The Nazis would then negotiate \"a separate peace\" with the United States, separate from any peace with the USSR, with which Germany would remain at war, now joined against the Soviets by th e United States. But Martin Bormann, who was even more powerful than Himmler, did not accept the premise of the separate-peace idea. Borm ann was an intimate of Hitler's, the deputy fuhrer and the head of the Nazi Party, t hus superior to Himmler in rank. Bormann wielded additional power as Hitler's link to the industrial and financial cartels that ran the Nazi economy and was particularly close to Hermann Schmitz, chief executive of I.G. Farben, the giant chemical firm that was Nazi Germany's greatest industrial power. With the support of Schmitz, Bormann rejected Himml er's separate-peace strategy on the ground that it was far too optimist ic. 6 The Allied military advan- tage was too great, Bormann believed, for Roosevelt to be talked into a separate peace. Roosevelt, after all, had taken the lead in proclaiming the Allies' demand for Germany's unconditional surrender and total de- Nazification. Bormann reasoned, rather, that the Nazi's best hope of surv iving military defeat lay within their own resources, chief of which was the cohesio n of tens of thousands of SS men for whom the prospect of surrender could offer only the gallows. Bormann and Schmitz developed a more aggressive, se lf-contained approach to the problem of the looming military defeat, the central concept of which was that large numbers of Nazis would have to leave Eur ope and, at least for a time, find places in the world in which to recover their strength. There were several possibilities in Latin America, most notably Argent ina and Paraguay; South Africa, Egypt, and Indonesia were also attractive rear area s in which to retreat. 7 After the German defeat in the battle of Normandy i n June 1944, Bormann took the first external steps toward implementing c oncrete plans for the Nazis' great escape. An enormous amount of Nazi treasure had to be moved out of Europe and made safe. This treasure was apparently divided int o several caches, of which the 174"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"T HE S ECRET T REATY OF F ORT H UNT one at the Reichsbank in Berlin included almost thr ee tons of gold (much of it the so-called tooth-gold from the slaughter camps) as well as silver, platinum, tens of thousands of carats of precious stones, and perhaps a billion dollars in various currencies. 8 There were industrial assets to be expatriated, inc luding large tonnages of- specialty steel and certain industrial machinery as well as blueprints critical to the domination of certain areas of manufacturing Key Nazi companies needed to be relicensed outside Germany in order to escape the reach of war-reparations claims. And tens of thousands of Nazi war criminals, almost all of them members of the SS, needed help to escape Germany and safely re group in foreign colonies capable of providing security and livelihoods. For help with the first three of these tasks, Borma nn convened a secret meeting of key German industrialists on August 10,1944, at the Hotel Maison Rouge in Strasbourg. 9 One part of the minutes of this meeting states: The [Nazi] Party is ready to supply large amounts o f money to those indus- trialists who contribute to the post war organizati on abroad. In return, the Party demands all financial reserves which have already b een transferred abroad or may later be transferred, so that after the defeat a st rong new Reich can be built. 10 The Nazi expert in this area was Hitler's one-time financial genius and Minister of the Economy, Dr. Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht, available to Bormann even tough he was in prison on suspicion of involvement in the anti-Hitler coup of 1944. According to a U.S. Treasury Department repor t of 1945, at least 750 enter- prises financed by the Nazi Party had been set up o utside Germany by the end of the war. These firms were capable of generating an annual income of approximately $30 million, all of it available to Nazi causes. 11 It was Schacht's ability to finesse the legalities of licensing and ownership that brou ght this situation about. 12 Organizing the physical removal of the Nazis' mater ial assets and the escape of SS personnel were the tasks of the hulking Otto Skorzeny, simultaneously an officer of the SS, the Gestapo, and the Waffen S S as well as Hitler's \"favorite commando.\" 13 Skorzeny worked closely with Bormann and Schacht in transporting the Nazi as- sets to safety outside Europe and in creating a net work of SS escape routes (\"rat lines\") that led from all over Germany to the Bavarian city of Memmingen, then to Rome, then by sea to a number of Nazi retreat colonies se t up in the global south. The international organization created to accommoda te Bormann's plans is most often called \"The Odessa,\" a German acronym fo r \"Organization of Vet- erans of the SS.\" It has remained active as a shado wy presence since the war and may indeed constitute Nazism's most notable organiz ational achievement. But we must understand that none of Bormann's, Skorzeny 's, and Schacht's well-laid plans would have stood the least chance of success had it not been for a final component of their organization, one not usually as sociated with the Odessa at all but very possibly the linchpin of the entire pr oject. 175"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY E NTER G EHLEN ______________________________________ HIS FINAL ELEMENT OF THE ODESSA was the so-called G ehlen Organization (the Org), the Nazi intelligence system that sold i tself to the U.S. at the end of the war. It was by far the most audacious, most critical, and most essential part of the entire Odessa undertaking. The literatu re on the Odessa and that on the Gehlen Organization, however, are two different things. No writer in the field of Nazi studies has yet explicitly associated the two, despite the fact that General Reinhard Gehlen was tied politically as wel l as personally with Skorzeny and Schacht. Moreover, Gehlen's fabled post-war org anization was in large part staffed by SS Nazis who are positively identified w ith the Odessa, men such as the infamous Franz Alfred Six and Emil Augsburg of the Wannsee Institute. An even more compelling reason for associating Gehlen with the Odessa is that, without his organization as a screen, the various Odessa pr ojects would have been directly exposed to American intelligence. If the Counter In telligence Corps (CIC) and the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) had not been neu tralized by the Gehlen ploy, the Odessa's great escape scheme would have been di scovered and broken up. At 43, Brigadier General Reinhard Gehlen was a stif f, unprepossessing man of five foot eight and a half inches and 128 pounds when he presented himself for surrender at the U.S. command center in Fischha usen. But there was nothing small about his ego. \"I am head of the section Fore ign Armies East in German Army Headquarters,\" he announced to the GI at the d esk. \"I have information to give of the highest importance to your government.\" The GI was not impressed, however, and Gehlen spent weeks stewing in a POW co mpound before an evident Soviet eagerness to find him finally aroused the Am ericans' attention. 14 Gehlen became chief of the Third Reich's Foreign Ar mies East (FHO), on April 1, 1942. He was thus responsible for Germany's mili tary intelligence operations throughout Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. His FHO was connected in this role with a number of secret fascist organi zations in the countries to Germany's east. These included Stepan Bandera's \"B Faction\" of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN/B), 15 Romania's Iron Guard, 16 the Ustachis of Yugoslavia, 17 the Vanagis of Latvia 18 and, after the summer of 1942, \"Vlassov's Army,\" 19 the band of defectors from Soviet Communism marchi ng behind for- mer Red hero General Audrey Vlassov. Later on in th e war, Gehlen placed one of his top men in control of Foreign Armies West, w hich broadened his power: and then after Admiral Wilhelm Canaris was purged a nd his Abwehr intelligence service cannibalized by the SS, Gehlen became in ef fect Nazi Germany's over-all top intelligence chief. T HE G REAT E SCAPE ___________________________________ N DECEMBER 1943, at the latest, Gehlen reached the same conclusion about the war that had come upon Bormann, Schacht, Skorzeny, and Himmler. Germany was losing and could do nothing about it. Several m onths later, Gehlen says, he began quietly discussing the impending defeat with a few close associates. As he 176 T I"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"T HE S ECRET T REATY OF F ORT H UNT writes in his memoir: \"Early in October 19441 told my more intimate colleagues that I considered the war was lost and we must begi n thinking of the future. We had to think ahead and plan for the approaching cat astrophe.\" 21 Gehlen's strategic response to Gotterdammerung was a kind of fusion of Him- mler's philosophy with Bormann's more pessimistic O dessa line: \"My view,\" he writes, \"was that there would be a place even for G ermany in a Europe rearmed for defense against Communism. Therefore we must se t our sights on the Western powers, and give ourselves two objectives: to help defend against Communist expansion and to recover and reunify Germany's lost territories.\" 22 Just as Bormann, Skorzeny, and Schacht were beginni ng to execute their escape plans, so too was Gehlen. \"Setting his sights on th e Western powers,\" and in particular on the United States, Gehlen pursued the following strategic rationale: When the alliance between the United States and the USSR collapsed, as it was bound to do upon Germany's defeat, the United State s would discover a pierc- ing need for a top-quality intelligence service in Eastern Europe and inside the Soviet Union. It did not have such a service of its own, and the pressures of the erupting East-West conflict would not give it time to develop one from scratch. Let the United States therefore leave the assets as sembled by Gehlen and the FHO intact. Let the United States not break up Gehl en's relationship with East European fascist groups. Let the United States pick up Gehlen's organization and put it to work for the West, the better to prevail in its coming struggle against a Soviet Union soon to become its ex-ally. Gehlen brought his top staff people into the planni ng for this amazing pro- posal. Together, during the last months of the war, while Hitler was first raging at Gehlen for his \"defeatist\" intelligence reports, then promoting him to the rank of brigadier general, then at last firing him altog ether (but promoting into the FHO directorship one of Gehlen's co-conspirators), Gehlen and his staff carefully prepared their huge files on East Europe and the So viet Union and moved them south into the Bavarian Alps and buried them. At th e same time, Gehlen began building the ranks of the FHO intelligence agents. The FHO in fact was the only organization in the whole of the Third Reich that w as actually recruiting new members as the war was winding down. 23 SS men who knew they would be in trouble when the Allied forces arrived now came flo cking to the FHO, knowing that it was the most secure place for them to be wh en the war finally ended. 24 When Gehlen's plans were complete and his preparati ons all concluded, he divided his top staff into three separate groups an d moved them (as Skorzeny was doing at the same time) into prearranged positions in Bavaria. Gehlen himself was in place before the German surrender on May 7, hiding comfortably in a well-stocked chalet in a mountain lea called Misery Meadow. Besides Gehlen, there were eight others in the Misery Meadow group, including two wounded men and three young women. For three weeks, maintai ning radio contact with the two other groups, Gehlen and his colleagues sta yed on the mountain, waiting for the American army to appear in the valley far b elow. \"These days of living in 177"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY the arms of nature were truly enchanting,\" he wrote . \"We had grown accustomed to the peace, and our ears were attuned to nature's every sound.\" 25 D ESTRUCTION OF THE OSS _____________________________ EHLEN WAS STILL COMMUNING WITH NATURE when William Donovan, chief of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), ar rived in Nuremberg from Washington, dispatched by the new president to assist Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson. Harry S. Truman had made Ja ckson the United States's chief prosecutor with the International Military Tr ibunal (IMT), established to try the Nazis' principal military leaders. Donovan' s OSS was to function as an investigative arm of the IMT. By the last half of the war if not before, Presiden t Roosevelt and Donovan were convinced that the U.S. needed a permanent int elligence service and that this service, like the OSS, should be civilian rath er than military. They were convinced too that the OSS should be its foundation . On October 31, 1944, Roosevelt directed Donovan to prepare a memo on how such a service should be organized. 26 Donovan consulted on this assignment with his colle ague Allen Dulles, a force unto himself as wartime chief of OSS operations in Bern. Dulles advised Donovan to placate the military by proposing that the new a gency be placed automatically under military command in time of war. 27 Donovan's proposal incorporated this idea, 28 but only in order to state all the more strongly t he case for civilian control and for making the OSS the basis of the new organiz ation. As he wrote in his memo to Roosevelt of November 18, 1944, \"There are common-sense reasons why you may desire to lay the keel of the ship at o nce .... We now have [in the OSS] the trained and specialized personnel needed f or such a task, and this talent should not be dispersed.\" 29 Donovan proposed establishment of a civilian intell igence service responsible directly to the President and the Secretary of Stat e, the chief mission of which would be to support the President in foreign policy . Except for the civilian Sec- retaries of War and the Navy, Donovan's plan did no t even include a place for military representation on the advisory board, and he was careful to specify that the advisory board would merely advise and not cont rol. The new service was to be all-powerful in its field, being responsible for \"coordination of the func- tions of all intelligence agencies of the Governmen t.\" The Donovan intelligence service, in other words, would directly and explici tly dominate the Army's G-2 and the Navy's ONI. 30 Naturally, therefore, the Donovan plan drew an inte nse attack from the military. One G-2 officer called it \"cumbersome and possibly dangerous.\" 31 Another referred to the OSS as \"a bunch of faggots\" 32 Nor was the FBI's J. Edgar Hoover silent. Hoover had fought creation of the OSS perhaps more bitterly than the military and had insisted throughout the war on maintaining an FBI intelligence network in Latin America despite the fact that this was sup posed to be OSS turf. 33 178 G"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"T HE S ECRET T REATY OF F ORT H UNT Certain elements within Army intelligence were not only opposed to Donovan's plan but were also beginning to formulate their own notions of what a post-war intelligence system should be like. Roosevelt sent the Joint Chiefs of Staff ultra-secr et copies of Donovan's proposal along with Roosevelt's own draft executive order to implement it. On January 1, 1945, the Chiefs formally reported to Roosevelt their extreme dissatisfaction with this scheme and leaked Donovan's memo to four right-wing newspapers, which leapt to the attack with blaring headlines ac cusing FDR and Donovan of conspiring to create \"a super Gestapo.\" This att ack put the Donovan plan on hold, and the death of FDR on April 12, 1945 destro yed it. 34 In early May 1945, president for less than a month, Truman made the OSS the American component of the investigative arm of the IMT. It is one of the fasci- nating conjunctions of this story that Donovan shou ld have left for Nuremberg just as Gehlen was coming down from his mountain. I t is one of its riper ironies that Donovan would soon resign from Jackson's staff in a disagreement over try- ing German officers as war criminals, which Donovan objected to but Jackson and Truman supported. 35 Had Donovan lent his energies to the trial of Nazi s within the German officer corps, he might have conf ronted the very adversaries who would shortly take his place in the American in telligence system, not only militarizing it, but Nazifying it as well. G EHLEN M AKES HIS M OVE _____________________________ EHLEN HAD BEEN ON THE MOUNTAIN for exactly three we eks and the war had been over for almost two weeks when he decided on May 19 that it was time to make contact. He left the three women a nd the two wounded men as Misery Meadow and with his four aides began the descent to the valley town of Fischhausen on Lake Schliersee. On the same day Soviet commissioners far to the nor th at Flensburg demanded that the United States hand over Gehlen as well as his files on the USSR. This was the first the U.S. command had heard of Gehlen. 36 Gehlen and company took their time, staying three d ays with the parents of one of his aides and communicating by radio with th ose who had remained at Misery Meadow. On May 22, Gehlen at last decided th e moment was right. He and his aides marched into the Army command center and represented themselves to the desk officer, a Captain John Schwarzwalder, to whom Gehlen spoke his prepared speech: \"I am head of the Section Foreign Armies East in Ge rman Army headquar- ters. I have information to give of the highest imp ortance to your government.\" Schwarzwalder had Gehlen and his group jeeped to Mi esbach where there was a OSS detachment. There Gehlen once again gave his speech, this time to a Captain Marian Porter: \"I have information of the g reatest importance for your supreme commander.\" Porter replied, \"So have they a ll,\" and shunted him and his cohorts off to the prison camp at Salzburg. 179 G"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Gehlen's disappointment at this reception was keen and his biographers all say he never forgot it, \"lapsing,\" as one puts it, \"int o near despair\" as he \"presented the strange paradox of a spy-master thirsting for r ecognition by his captors.\" 37 Recognition was inevitable, however, since the CIC was trying to find him. By mid June at the latest, his name was recognized by a G-2 officer, Colonel William H. Quinn, who had Gehlen brought to Augsburg for hi s first serious interrogation. Quinn was the first American to whom Gehlen present ed his proposal and told of his staff dispersed at several camps in the mountai ns as well as the precious buried archives of the FHO. Unlike Captain Porter, Colonel Quinn was impressed. He promptly passed Gehlen up the command chain to Gene ral Edwin I. Sibert. Sibert later recalled, \"I had a most excellent impr ession of him at once.\" Gehlen immediately began educating him as to \"the a ctual aims of the Soviet Union and its display of military might.\" As Sibert told a journalist years later, \"With her present armed forces potential, he [Gehle n] continued, Russia could risk war with the West and the aim of such a war wo uld be the occupation of West Germany.\" 38 Acting without orders, Sibert listened to Gehlen fo r several days before inform- ing Eisenhower's chief of staff, General Walter Bed ell Smith. 39 Smith and Sibert then continued to develop their relationship with G ehlen secretly, choosing not to burden Eisenhower with knowledge of what they we re doing \"in order not to compromise him in his relations with the Soviets .\" 40 Eisenhower in fact had strictly forbidden U.S. fraternization with Germans . 41 Gehlen was encouraged to resume contact with his FH O comrades who were still at large in Bavaria, releasing them from thei r vow of silence. Gehlen was sufficiently confident of his American relationship s by this time that he dug up his buried files and, in special camps, put his FHO experts to work preparing detailed reports on the Red Army for his American c aptors. Well before the end of June he and his comrades were \"discharged from p risoner of war status so that we could move around at will.\" 42 They were encouraged to form a unit termed a \"general staff cell,\" first within G-2's Historic al Research Section, then later in the Seventh Army's Intelligence Center in Wiesba den, where they worked in private quarters and were treated as VIPs. 43 Indeed, a partly declassified CIA document recapitu lated this story in the early 1970s, noting at this time: Gehlen met with Admiral Karl Doenitz, who had been appointed by Hitler as his successor during the last days of the Third Reich. Gehlen and the Admiral were now in a U.S. Army VIP prison camp in Wiesbade n; Gehlen sought and received approval from Doenitz too! 44 In other words, the German chain of command was sti ll in effect, and it ap- proved of what Gehlen was doing with the Americans. Gehlen's biographers are under the impression that it took six weeks for some- one in European G-2 to notice and recognize Gehlen in the POW cage, that Sibert did not tell Smith about finding him until t he middle of August, and that it 180"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"T HE S ECRET T REATY OF F ORT H UNT was much later still before Sibert and Smith conspi red to circumvent Eisenhower and communicate their excitement about Gehlen to so meone at the Pentagon presumably associated with the Joint Chiefs of Staf f. 45 But documents released in the 1980s show that this part of Gehlen's story rac ed along much more quickly. Already on June 29, in fact, the Pentagon had infor med Eisenhower's European command that the War Department wanted to see Gehle n in Washington. 46 It was a fast time. By no later than August 22, one of Gehlen's top associates, Hermann Baun, was forming what would become the int elligence and counter- intelligence sections of Gehlen's new organization. Gehlen himself, with retinue, was departing for Washington in General Bedell Smit h's DC-3 for high-level talks with American military and intelligence officials. And the whole concept of the with he was about to offer his conquerors had been approved by a Nazi chain of command that was still functioning despite what the world thought and still does think was the Nazis' unconditional surrender. 47 Gehlen arrived in Washington on August 24 with six of his top FHO aides and technical experts in tow. 48 World War II had been over about a week, the war in Europe about three and a half months. T HE S ECRET T REATY OF F ORT H UNT _____________________ S GEHLEN AND HIS SIX MEN were en route from Germany to Washington, Donovan's OSS troubles became critical. On August 2 3, Admiral William Leahy, chief of the JCS, the President's national security adviser and a man who despised Donovan, advised Truman to order his budget directo r Harold Smith to begin a study of the intelligence question. Stating \"this country wanted no Gestapo under any guise or for any reason,\" 49 Truman may not have known that the Gestapo's Odess a heirs were landing in the lap of the Pentagon even as he spoke. Smith in any case responded to Truman's directive by asking Donovan for his OSS demobilization plans. Now, too late, Donovan tried to fight. The Gehlen p arty, \"Group 6,\" was checking out its very comfortable accommodations at Fort Hunt at the very moment at which Donovan, writing from a borrowed Wa shington office, fired back a memo to Smith defending the OSS and its righ t to live: Among these assets [of the OSS] was establishment f or the first time in our nation's history of a foreign secret intelligence s ervice which reported information as seen through American eyes. As an integral and i nseparable part of this service, there is a group of specialists to analyze and eval uate the material for presentation to those who determine national policy. 50 Much more significant than the question of the adeq uacy of U.S. intelligence on the Soviet Union, however, was the question of c ivilian versus military control of the intelligence mission. Germany and England ha d fought this battle in the 19th century, the military capturing the intelligen ce role in Germany and the civilians maintaining a position in England. Throug hout the summer and fall of 1945, this same battle raged in the U.S. government . 51 The battle for intelligence control was indeed the background for the arrival o f Gehlen and his six aides at 181 A"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Fort Hunt, where Gehlen's party was housed and Gehl en himself provided with an NCO butler and several white-jacket orderlies. 52 A momentous relationship was established at Fort Hu nt, one that had the pro- foundest effects on the subsequent evolution of Uni ted States foreign policy during an exceptionally difficult passage of world history . The period of the Cold War as a whole, and more especially its early, formative yea rs — from Gehlen's coming aboard the American intelligence service until he rejoined the West German republic in 1955 — was laden with the peril of nuclear war. On at least one occasion, in 1948, 53 Gehlen almost convinced the United States that the Soviet Union was about to launch a war against the West and that it would be in the U.S. interest to preempt it. Clearly it is important to know who made and author ized the decisions that led to our national dependency on a network of unde rground Nazis. Yet because the relevant documents are still classified, this c entral part of the Gehlen story still cannot be reconstructed. From the handful of published books about the Gehle n affair (none of which cite their sources on this point) we can list only seven Americans who were said to be involved with Gehlen at Fort Hunt: • Admiral William D. Leahy, chief of staff and Truman 's national security advisor. • Allen Dulles, OSS station chief in Bern during the war. • Sherman Kent, head of OSS Research and Analysis Bra nch and a Yale historian. • General George V. Strong, head of Army G-2. • Major General Alex H. Boiling of G-2. • Brigadier General John T Magruder, first head of th e Army's Strategic Services Unit, a vulture of OSS. • Loftus E. Becker, a lawyer assc. with G-2 and the N uremberg war-crimes opera- tion; the CIAs first deputy director. We do not know if these people were involved as a c ommittee, if they talked with Gehlen and his six aides a lot or a little, se parately or all at once, or if they sent their own aides to work out the details. We do not know how a POW-inter- rogation was transformed into a bargaining process. Above all, we do not know what kind of communication the U.S. participants in the Fort Hunt-Gehlen talks had with the political authorities to whom th ey were responsible. Leahy is the only one who had obvious contact with Presid ent Truman. But there is nothing in the revealed record to indicate that he ever discussed Gehlen or the Fort Hunt deal with Truman, or took the least troub le to explain to Truman the implications of hiring a Nazi spy network. We have no idea, for that matter, how Leahy himself saw it. What we do know is the outlines of the Gehlen deal itself, however it was hammered out and however it was or was not ratified by legal, political author- ity. That is because Gehlen himself laid out its te rms in his autobiography, The Service. Gehlen says in this work (which has been a ttacked for its inaccuracies that the discussion ended with \"a 'gentlemen's agre ement,'\" that the terms of his relationship with the United States were \"for a var iety of reasons never set down 182"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"T HE S ECRET T REATY OE F ORT H UNT in black and white.\" He continues, \"Such was the el ement of trust that had been built up between the two sides during this year of intensive personal contact - that neither had the slightest hesitation in foun ding the entire operation on a verbal agreement and a handshake.\" 54 According to Gehlen, this agreement consisted of the following six basic points. His la nguage is worth savoring. \"I remember the terms of the agreement well,\" he wrote : \"1. A clandestine German intelligence organization was to be set up, using the existing potential to continue information gath ering in the East just as we had been doing before. The basis for this was our c ommon interest in a defense against communism.\" \"2. This German organization was to work not 'for' or 'under' the Americans, but 'jointly with the Americans.' \"3. The organization would operate exclusively unde r German leadership, which would receive its directives and assignments from the Americans until a new government was established in Germany.\" \"4. The organization was to be financed by the Amer icans with funds which were not to be part of the occupation costs, and in return the organization would supply all its intelligence reports to the American s.\" (The Gehlen Organization's first annual budget is said to have been $3.4 milli on. 55 )\" \"5. As soon as a sovereign German government was es tablished, that govern- ment should decide whether the organization should continue to function or not, but that until such time the care and control (late r referred to as 'the trusteeship') of the organization would remain in American hands. \" \"6. Should the organization at any time find itself in a position where the American and German interests diverged, it was acce pted that the organization would consider the interests of Germany first.\" 56 Gehlen acknowledges that the last point especially might \"raise some eyebrows\" and make some think that the U.S. side \"had gone ov erboard in making conces- sions to us.\" He assures his readers that actually \"this point demonstrates better than any other Sibert's great vision: he recognized that for many years to come the interests of the United States and West Germany mus t run parallel.\" 57 Gehlen and his staff left Fort Hunt for Germany on July 1, 194 6, having been in the United States for almost a year. They were temporarily bas ed at Oberursel then settled into a permanent base in a walled-in, self-contained vil lage at Pullach near Munich. Gehlen set up his headquarters in an estate origina lly built by Martin Bormann. 58 There a start-up group of 50 began to turn the \"gen tlemen's agreement\" of Fort Hunt into reality. The first order of business bein g staff, Gehlen's recruiters were soon circulating among the \"unemployed mass\" of \"fo rmer\" Nazi SS men, the Odessa constituency, to find more evaluators, couri ers and informers. 59 Gehlen had \"solemnly promised in Washington not to employ SS and Gestapo men,\" 60 although it will be noted that Gehlen includes no s uch provision in his list of terms. There is not the least question that he did recruit such men, supplying them with new names when necessary. 183"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Two of the worst of them were Franz Six and Emil Au gsburg. Six was a key Nazi intellectual, and both Six and Augsburg were a ssociated with the Wannsee Institute, the Nazi think-tank in Berlin where SS l eader Reinhard Heydrich, in January 1942, announced \"The Final Solution to the Jewish Question.\" Both of them had commanded extermination squads roving in E ast Europe in pursuit of Jews and communists. And both had gone underground with the Odessa when the Third Reich crumbled. Augsburg hid in Italy, th en returned in disguise when Gehlen called. Six was actually captured by Allied intelligence, tried at Nuremberg and imprisoned, only to be sprung to work with Augs burg running Gehlen's networks of East European Nazis. 61 From the edge of total defeat, Gehlen now moved int o his vintage years, more powerful, influential and independent than he had b een even in the heyday of the Third Reich.

Through his close ties to Chancellor Konra d Adenauer's chief minister, Hans Globke, Gehlen was able to place his men in po sitions of control in West Germany's military intelligence and the internal co unterintelligence arm. When NATO was established he came to dominate it too. By one estimate \"some 70 percent\" of the total intelligence take flowing int o NATO's military committee and Allied headquarters (SHAPE) on the Soviet Union, th e countries of East Europe, the rest of Europe, and indeed the rest of the worl d was generated at Pullach. 63 Not even the establishment of the CIA in 1947 and t he official transfer of the Pullach operation into the West German government i n 1955 (when it was retitled the Federal Intelligence Service, BND) lessened the reliance of American intel- ligence on Gehlen's product. 64 From the beginning days of the Cold War through the 1970s and beyond, the United States's, West Ger many's, and NATO's most positive beliefs about the nature and intentions of the Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact, and world communism would be supplied by an i nternational network of utterly unreconstructed SS Nazis whose primary p urposes were to cover the escape of the Odessa and make the world safe for Na zism.

They include above all the story of the enormous victory of the Odessa in planting powerful Nazi colonies around th e world — in such countries as South Africa, where the enactment of apartheid laws followed; or several countries in Latin America that then became breeding grounds for the Death Squads of the current day, and indeed even in the United Stat es where it now appears that thousands of wanted Nazis were able to escape justi ce and grow old in peace. In making the Gehlen deal, the United States did no t acquire for itself an intel- ligence service. That is not what the Gehlen group was or was trying to be. The military intelligence historian Colonel William Cor son put it most succinctly, \"Gehlen' s organization was designed to protect the Odessa Nazis. It amounts to an exceptionally well-orchestrated diversion.\" 65 The only intelligence provided by the Gehlen net to the United States was intelligenc e selected specifically to worsen East-West tensions and increase the possibility of military conflict between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. It was exactly as the ri ght-wing papers had warned in 1945 when they were aroused by Donovan's proposal f or a permanent intelligence corps, warning their readers that a \"super spy unit \" could \"determine American foreign policy by weeding out, withholding or color ing information gathered at his direction.\" 66 It was exactly as Truman had warned when he demobi lized the OSS with the observation that the US, had no intere st in \"Gestapo-like measures.\" The fact that this lively concern for a police-stat e apparatus should have been focused on the relatively innocuous OSS while at th e same time the red carpet was being rolled out for Gehlen's gang of SS men mu st surely count as one of the supreme wrenching ironies of the modern period. Another dimension of the cost of the Gehlen deal is the stress it induced within American institutions, weakening them incalculably. The Gehlen Organization was the antithesis of the Allied cause, its siniste r emergence on the scene of post- war Europe the very opposite of what the western de mocracies thought they had been fighting for. Perhaps at least we can say that, despite Gehlen an d despite the military, the United States did after all finally wind up with a civilian intelligence service. The National Security Act of 1947 did embody Donovan's central point in creating a CIA outside the military. But in fact the Gehlen Org substantially pre-empted the CIA's civilian character before it was ever bor n. The CIA was born to be rocked in Gehlen's cradle. It remained dependent on the Org even when the Org turned into the BND. Thus, whatever the CIA was fro m the standpoint of the law, it remained from the standpoint of practical i ntelligence collection a front for a house of Nazi spies. The Org was not merely military, which is bad, not merely foreign, which is much worse, and not merely Nazi, which is intolerab le; it was not even profession- ally committed to the security of the U.S. and West ern Europe. It was committed exclusively to the security of the Odessa.

It never cared in the least for the security of the United States, its Constitu tion or its democratic tradition. It is not the point of this essay that there would have been no Cold War if the Odessa had not wanted it and had not been able, through the naive col- laboration of the American military Right, to place Gehlen and his network in a position that ought to have been occupied by a de scendant of the OSS. But it was precisely because the world was so volatile and confusing as of the transition from World War II to peacetime that the U.S. needed to see it, as Donovan put it in his plaintive appeal to Truman in the summer of 1945, \"through American eyes.\" No Nazi eyes, however bright, could see it f or us without deceiving us and leading us to the betrayal of our own national char acter. Second, there was no way to avoid the Cold War once we had taken the desperate step of opening our doors to Gehlen. From that moment on, from the summer of 1945 when the Army brought him into t he United States and made a secret deal with him, the Cold War was locke d in. A number of Cold War historians on the left (for example D.E Fleming and Gabriel Kolko) have made cogent arguments that from the Soviet point of view the Cold War was thrust upon us by an irrational and belligerent Sta lin. The story of the secret treaty of Fort Hunt exposes this \"history\" as a sel f-serving political illusion. On the contrary, the war in the Pacific was still ragi ng and the United States was still trying to get the Soviet Union into the war against Japan when General Sibert was already deep into his relationship with Gehlen. The key point that comes crashing through the pract ical and moral confusion about this matter, once one sees that Gehlen's Orga nization was an arm of the Odessa, is that, whether it was ethical or not, the U.S. did not pick up a Gift Horse in Gehlen at all; it picked up a Trojan Horse . The unconditional surrender the Germans made to the Allied command at the little red schoolhouse in Reims was the surrend er only of the German armed services. It was not the surrender of the hard SS c ore of the Nazi Party. The SS did not surrender, unconditionally or otherwise, an d thus Nazism itself did not surrender. The SS chose rather, to seek other means of continuing the war while the right wing of the United States military establ ishment, through fears and secret passions and a naivete of its own, chose to facilit ate that choice. The history that we have lived through since then stands witness to the consequences. Carl Oglesby is the author of several books, notabl y The Yankee and Cowboy War.

A rogue's gallery of various commercial , ideological, political and bureaucratic partners fill out the foundation of th is conspiracy. What is the Illuminati? In 1785, a courier died en route to Paris from Frank- fort-on-the-Main. Original Shift in Days of Illumin ations, a tract written by Adam \"Spartacus\" Weishaupt, founder of the Illuminati, w as recovered from the dead messenger. It contained the secret society's long-r ange plan for The New World Order through world revolution. The Bavarian Government promptly outlawed the socie ty and in 1787 pub- lished the details of The Illuminati conspiracy in The Original Writings of the Order and Sect of the Illuminati. The Illuminati was publicly founded May 1, 1776, at the University of Ingolstadt by Weishaupt, a Professor of Canon Law. It was a very \"learned\" society; Weishaupt dre w the earliest members of his new order from among his students. In Adam Weishaupt's own words: \"By this plan, we shall direct all mankind in this manner. And, by the simplest means, we shall set all in motion and in flames. The occupati ons must be so allotted and contrived that we may, in secret, i nfluence all political transactions.\" There is disagreement among scholars as to whether or not the Illuminati survived its banishment. Nevertheless, under Weisha upt's guidance, the group had been quite successful in attracting members and through various manipula- tions had allied itself with the extensive Masonic networks in Europe and the United States. On December 5,1776, students at William and Mary Co llege founded a secret I society, Phi Beta Kappa. A second chapter was forme d at Yale in 1780. The anti-Masonic movement which erupted in the United States during the 1820s denounced the se crecy of groups such as Phi Beta Kappa. The society respo nded to this pressure by going public. Some researchers note this as the direct cause of the appearance of Yale's Order of Skull and Bones. The alumni of Skull and Bones provide a di- rect link between secret societies and the state department/national security apparatus. From George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography: ...

In the later years of the Eisenhower presidency , Gordon Gray rejoined the government. As an intimate friend and golfing partn er of Prescott Bush, Gray complemented the Bush influence on Ike. The Bush-Gr ay family partnership in the secret government continues up through the Geor ge Bush presidency. Gordon Gray had been appointed head of the new Psyc hological Strategy Board in 1951 under Averell Harriman's rule as assistant to President Truman for national security affairs. From 1958 to 1961 Gordon Gray held the identi- cal post under President Eisenhower. Gray acted as Ike's intermediary, strategist and hand-holder, in the President's relations with the CIA and the U.S. and allied military forces. Eisenhower did not oppose the CIA's covert action p rojects; he only wanted to be protected from the consequences of their fail ure or ex- posure. Gray's primary task, in the guise of oversi ght on all U.S. covert action, was to protect and hide the gro wing mass of CIA and related secret government activities. It was not only covert projects which were develope d by the Gray-Bush-Dulles combination; it was also new, hidden structures of the United States government.

They wanted a young candidate to run for Congress. Nixon ap- plied and won the job, becoming a mouthpiece for th e Bush group, progressing to the U.S. Senate and in 1952 the vice presidency. In 1960, Vice President Nixon was scouring the worl d seeking the presidency. At his side was Prescott Bush. Congress man Gerald Ford was helping raise funds, as was George Bush. It took Nixon eight more years to reach his goal. A nd the canny politician always remembered who helped him get there. So again it was payback time for George Bush. Nixon appointed him Chairman of the Republican National Committee, and later am- bassador to China. By 1976, Ford, who succeeded Nixon after Watergate, paid his due bill. He picked out big job for his old crony, Bush: the CIA . But this time Bush would not be an underling.

Scores of people were engaged in varied peripheral plots and sub-plots, many of which were related tangentially or not at a ll to the actual assassination. As a result, the pertinent facts drowned in a contr ived whirlpool of suspicious, but not necessarily related, activity. But who was REALLY involved? Rodney Stich's book Defrauding America tells of a deep- cover CIA officer assigned to a counter-intelligenc e unit, code-named Pegasus. This unit had tape-recordings o f plans to assassinate Kennedy from a tap on the phone of J . Edgar Hoover. The people on the tapes were [Nelson] Rocke feller, Allen Dulles, [Lyndon] Johnson of Texas, George [HW ] Bush and J. Edgar Hoover. According to Stich's source, There were conversa- tions between Rockefeller, [J. Edgar] Hoover, where Rockefeller asks, Are we going to have any problems ?\" And he said, \"No, we aren't going to have any probl ems. I checked with Dulles. If they do their job we'll d o our job.\" There are a whole bunch of tapes, because Hoo ver didn't realize that his phone had been tapped. The inner core of the conspiracy is bound tightly t ogether by oaths of secrecy and affiliations with various secret societies alli ed with various Nazi groups, mind control operations and business ventures. Much of t he operational apparatus used in the conspiracy lay hidden in the shadow world of ultra-secret national security state entities such as Division Five of the FBI, th e Defense Industrial Security Command and double/triple agents of various allegia nces. The Torbitt Document and The Man Who Knew Too Much detail the work- ings of this actual operational framework.

Mr. Downard's co-researcher and author, Michael A. Hoffman II, wrote in Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare that: \"f abled alchemy had at least three goals to accomplish before the t otal decay of matter, the total breakdown we are witnessing al l around us today, was fulfilled and these are: The Creation and Destruction of Primordial Matter. The Killing of the Divine King. The Bringing of Prima Materia to Prima Terra.\" Hoffman writes: [The following excerpt is copyright © 1995 by Michael A. Hoffman II. All Rights Reserved.

The Trinity Site itself is located at the beginning of an ancient Western road known in old Mexico as the Jornada del Muerto (the Journey of the Dead Man). Early in this century a Freemason named Peter Kern was ordered to build a highly symbolic \"Gate of Death\" at a key point on this ancient trail. It was known as the Gate with a Thousand Doors. At the front of this gate Kern was ceremonially mur dered (decapitated) by a hooded executioner. Gary Trudeau satirized the Az tec-masonic Comazotz head-chopping cult of the American Southwest in a s eries of December, 1988, Doonesbury cartoons which depicted Skull and Bones initiates trying to dispose of a number of heads including that of Pancho Villa , a key political operative of the cryptocracy who was in fact also ritually decap itated. Other occult rituals for the Creation and Destructi on of Primordial Matter were played out in the general area of the 33rd deg ree of north parallel latitude in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. The Trinity Site is also at this latitude. There are 33 segments in the human spinal column wh ich according to occult lore is the vehicle of the fiery ascent of the Kund alini serpent force which resides in the human body. 33 is the highest degree of Scot tish Rite Freemasonry. Near the Trinity Site a derelict shack was symbolically dubbed \"MacDonald House.\" The Creation and Destruction of Primordial Matter o ccurred exactly on the Trinity Site, the Place of Fire, with the explo sion of the first atomic bomb, culminating untold thousands of years of alchemical speculation and practice. The Killing of the King rite was accomplished at an other Trinity site located approximately ten miles south of the 33rd degree of north parallel latitude between the Trinity River and the Triple Underpass at Deale y Plaza in Dallas, Texas. Dealey Plaza was the site of the first masonic temple in D allas. In this spot, which had been known during the 19th century cowboy era as \"B loody Elm Street,\" the world leader who had become known as the \"King of C amelot,\" President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, was shot to death. A widely publicized image, which has become perhaps the key symbol of the enigma of the Kennedy hoodwink, emerged immediately in the wake of the assassination: a photograph of three \"tramps\" in official custody, who were unexplainably released and never iden- tified, though speculation about who they really were has reached fever pitch among investigators.

T HE A LCHEMY OF R ITUAL M URDER ____________________________ What ought to be unambiguous to any student of mass psychology, is the almost immediate decline of the American people in the wake of this shocking televised slaughter. There are many indicators of t he transformation. Within a year Americans had largely switched from softer-ton ed, naturally colored cotton clothing to garish-colored artificial polyesters. P opular music became louder, faster and more cacophonous. Drugs appeared for the first time outside the Bohemian subculture ghettos in the mainstream. Extr emes of every kind came into fashion. Revolutions in cognition and behavior were on the horizon, from the Beatles to Charles Manson, from Free Love to LS D. The killers were not caught, the Warren Commission was a whitewash. There was a sense that the men who ordered the assas- sination were grinning somewhere over cocktails and out of this, a nearly-psychedelic wonder seized the American population, an awe- some shiver before the realization that whoever could kill a president 197 "},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWEREUL S ECRET S OCIETY of the United States in broad daylight and get away with it, could get away with anything. A hidden government behind the visible government o f these United States became painfully obvious in a kind of subliminal wa y and lent an undercurrent of the hallucinogenic to our reality. Welcome to Oz thanks to the men behind Os-wald and Ruby. There was a transfer of power in the collective gro up mind of the American masses: from the public power of the elected front- man Chief Executive, to an unelected invisible college capable of terminating him with impunity. For the first time in their history since the 1826 masonic assassination of writer William Morgan, Americans were forced to con front the vertiginous reality of a hidden power ruling their world. Sir James Fra zer writing in The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion, explains that when the \"divine king\" is murdered by one who is himself stronger or craft ier, those powers of \"divinity\" which were the king's are \"Sympathetically\" and \"Co ntagiously\" transferred from the vanquished to the victor. The entry of this awareness into the subconscious G roup \"Dreaming\" Mind of the American masses instituted a new simulacrum. The shocking introduction of a diametrically different, new \"reality\" is a cl assic scenario of another phase of alchemical programming known to the cryptocracy as \"Clamores.\" Dave Marsh writing in Rolling Stone magazine (Feb. 24, 1977): \"The Beatles have always had an intimate con- nection to the JFK assassination. He was shot the week before Thanksgiving 1963. By February 1964, the Beatles were number one in the national charts and the climactic appearance on Ed Sullivan's TV show occurred. Even Brian Epstein (the manager of the Beatles) believed the Ken- nedy assassination helped their rise - the Beatles appeared to bind our wounds with their messages of joy and handholding .... And the way was paved, replacing Camelot with Oz.\" Now the American people were forced to confront a s cary alternative reality, the reality of a shadow government, over which they had neither control or knowl- edge. The shepherding process was thus accelerated with a vengeance. Avant-garde advertising, music, politics and news would hereaft er depict (especially in the electronic media) — sometimes fleetingly, sometimes openly — a \"shadow side\" of reality, an underground amoral \"funhouse\" curren t associated with extreme sex, extreme violence and extreme speed.

The perpetrators deliberately murdered JFK in such a way as to affect our national identity and cohesiveness — to fracture America's s oul. Even the blatancy of their conspiracy was designed to show their superiority a nd our futility. They were doing to the nation what they had been doing to individua ls for years. Looking into the subject of mind-control, one finds that the scope is wide and methods used are sophisticated. Mind control tr aces its origins to religious institutional use by priesthoods. Techniques of min d control developed in our western culture were field-tested by the Jesuits, c ertain Vatican groups, and vari- ous mystery religions, secret societies and masonic organizations. Methods tested during the Inquisition were refined by Dr. Josef Me ngele during the reign of the Third Reich. After World War II, hundreds of Nazi scientists, re search- ers and administrators were \"smuggled\" into the Uni ted States against direct written orders from President Harry S. Truman, through Operation Sunrise, Operation Blowba ck, Operation Paperclip and other covert operations. 199 "},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Soon afterwards, a mind control project called Mari - onette Programming imported from Nazi Germany was revived under the new name, \"Project Monarch.\" The basic component of the Monarch program is the sophisticat ed manipulation of the mind, using extreme trauma to i n- duce Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), now known as Disassociative Disorder. In public testimony submitted to the President's Co m- mittee on Radiation, there are amazing allegations of severe torture and inhumane pogroms foisted upon Americans and other citizens, especially as children. These s ame children were used in ra- diation experiments. They detail the drug and traum atic methodology of sophisticated mind control. Survivor s tell similar stories of brutal mind control experim enta- tion as part of the CIA's MKULTRA program. Many mind control survivors speak of a \"Dr. Greene.\" Som e survivors and researchers have identified Dr. Green e as the infamous Dr. Mengele. But mind control programs and assassinations are me rely part of a much larger enterprise being carried out by an internati onal network of power interests. In 1995, a researcher-lawyer anonymously posted on the Internet his ten-year investigation of this conspiracy on the Internet. C alling the JFK assassination part of a 50-year conspiracy, he detailed the struc ture of this international network, which he named \"the group.\" The inner work ings and New World Order agenda of this group fit snugly with what oth er researchers have called the Illuminati.

The remarks were recorded in a 1966 interview with Prescott for an oral history project about the Eisenhower Administration by Columbia Uni versity. The Bush political family seems to have taken those words to heart, one example being the story of Prescott's involvement with the Union Banking Corporation and the financing of Hitler and fascism. Why there has been such a deliberate and hard cover-up of this affair is in no doubt due to its sensitive nature. The who, what and where of this business is already covered in several of the other articles in this book. Here we will examine t he story as it appears today. The specific allegations about the Union Banking Co rporation first surfaced in Antony Sutton's 1975 book, Wall Street and the R ise of Hitler. Sutton at that time did not know about the Order of Skull & Bones. After becoming aware of the Order in 1983 he expanded his writings on th e subject in How the Order Creates War and Revolution in 1984, which was later published, with Antony's three other booklets on The Order of Skull & Bones, together as America's Secret Establishment in 1986. The charges were articulated again in 1988 in Sutton's The Two Faces of George Bush. The mainstream press and establishment historians i gnored Sutton's books and the accusations.

They found in U.S. government archives the vesting order seizing the Union Banking Corporation and documented other Harriman/B ush controlled interests that were doing business with the Nazis. Their book was published by Executive Intelligence Review, a Lyndon Laurouche organization, and again the reports were ignored. John Loftus, a former attorney for the Office of Sp ecial Operations prosecuting Nazi war criminals in the US Justice Department als o added information about the situation in his 1994 book, The Secret War Agai nst the Jews. A Dutch producer Daniel de Witt, from Dutch Nationa l Television interviewed Sutton, Chaitkin, Tarpley and others in 1996, for a documentary on Skull & Bones that included confirmation from Dutch officia ls concerning the Union Banking Corporation and its activities in financing Hitler through a Dutch bank, the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvart (Bank for Trade and Shipping). From the documentary: \"Original documents of the Amsterdam b ased International In- stitute of Social History (Instituut voor Sociale G eschiedenis) clearly show the connection between the BHS, the August Thyssen Bank from Fritz Thyssen and Harriman's Union Banking Corporation.\" The show — as produced — never aired.* The show was listed in printed sched- ules and there was a preview in a TV guide but the program was pulled just before being a televised in 1998. Finally in January 2001, a re-edited thirty minute seg- ment of the original eighty minute film was aired p lus ten minutes of new footage of interviews of the movie, The Skulls, writer and director. With the advent and growth of the Internet and its ability to by-pass the mainstream media editorial bottleneck there was a g rowing awareness of the Nazi-Bush financial connections. Newspaper reporter Michael Kranish finally made the accusations public through a mainstream pr ess article in the Boston Globe that became the story about the charges. A fr ont-page article headlined Triumphs, Troubles Shape Generations, ran on April 23, 2001. The story was told in first three paragraphs. The story: Prescott Bush was surely aghast at a sensational ar ticle the New York Herald Tribune splashed on its front page in July 1942. \"Hitler's Angel Has 3 Million in US Bank,\" read the headline above a story reporting that Adolf Hitler's financier had stowed the fortun e in Union Banking Corp., possibly to be held for \"Nazi bigwigs.\" Bush knew all about the New York bank: He was one of its seven directors. If the Nazi tie became known, it w ould be a potential \"embarrassment,\" Bush and his partners at Brown Brothers Harriman wo rried, explaining to government regulators that their position was merely an unpaid courtesy for a client. The situation grew more serious when the government seized Union' s assets under the Trading with the Enemy Act, the sort of action that could have r uined Bush's political dreams. As it turned out, his involvement wasn't pursued by the press or political opponents during his Senate campaigns a decade later. But the episode may well have been one of the catalysts for a dramatic change in his life.

He traveled the country raising millions of dollars to help boost the morale of US troops during World War II, enhancing his stature in a way that helped him get elected US senator. A son and g randson would become presidents. The next fifty plus paragraphs extolled Prescott's liberal virtues, proclaimed him to be \"akin to the Kennedys\" and mentions Prescott' s membership in the Yale singing group the Whiffenpoofs, but failed to infor m about his membership in the Order of Skull & Bones. Alexandra Robbins, a member of Yale's second oldest senior secret society Scroll & Key, used the story in 2002 to deflect the charges in her faux expose of the Order of Skull & Bones, Secrets of the Tomb: Nor was it Skull and Bones that specifically instru cted members to aid Adolf Hitler, though Hitler's financier stowed $3 million in the Union Banking Corporation, a bank that counted among its seven directors Prescott Bus h. That's it. That is Ms. Robbins complete comment on the subject of the Union Banking Corporation, financing of Hitler and the Or der of Skull & Bones. No mention about the American Ship and Commerce Compan y, Consolidated Silesian Steel Corporation, Hamburg-Amerika Lines, Harriman Fifteen Corpo- ration, Harriman International Company, Holland-Ame rican Trading Company, Seeamless Steel Corporation or the Silesian-America n Corporation, companies of which Brown Brothers Harriman were involved and all of which were enmeshed with Hitler's rise to power. No mention that under the Trading with the Enemy Act many of these companies were seized and were pl aced at the US Office of Alien Property Custodian. No mention that the Union Banking Corporation was established in August 1924 with George Herbert Walk er serving as president and working out of the offices of W. A. Harriman and Co mpany. No mention that in 1932, four out of the eight bank directors were mem bers of the Order of Skull & Bones. No mention that, in the fall of 1942 when Un ion Banking Corporation was taken over by the government, that a total of t hree out of seven directors were members of the Order and that a fourth directo r was an employee of Brown Brothers Harriman — effectively giving Brown Brothe rs Harriman voting control. No mention that while there were many other non-Bon es personnel in partnership at Brown Brothers Harriman, none of them were direc tors of Union Banking, only Bones partners were on the Union Banking Corpo ration board. The only exception being not another partner but a Brown Bro thers Harriman employee. No mention that two of the other directors have been i dentified as Nazis. There was no mention of published accounts such as \"[a] 1934 congressional investigation alleged that Walker's Hamburg-Amerika Line subsidiz ed a wide-range of pro-Nazi propaganda efforts both in Germany and the United S tates;\" or that in June of 1936 \"[i]nstead of divesting of the Nazi money, [Pr escott] Bush hired a lawyer 205"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY to hide his assets. The lawyer he hired ... was All en Dulles.\" Was it because Ms. Robbins didn't do her homework — or was she just adv ancing the story? The story next gets extended and massaged in Mickey Herskowitz's craftily written just released 2003 biography of Prescott Bush, Duty, Honor, Country: In everyone's life there is a summer of '42; Presco tt Bush spent his on Wall Street, where nostalgia and romance are not the hot commodities they were in the motion picture that made the phrase symbolic. A headline that landed on the front page of the New York Herald Tribune in July of that year read: \"Hitler's Angel Has 3 Million in U.S. Bank.\" The reference was to the Union Banking Corporation. Prescott may have been u pset or alarmed by the disclosure — he was one of its seven directors. A person of le ss established ethics would have been panicked. The story claimed that the bank held $3 million in deposits for a German business- man, described as a \"financier\" for Adolf Hitler. T here was speculation that the account may have been intended for the later use of \"Nazi b igwigs.\" Buried in the databases that dealt with the Bush fa mily political tradition, the article was rediscovered and reported in the Boston Globe, in April 2001, by Michael Kranish. He concluded in the article that the connection had represented a potential \"embarrass- ment\" for Prescott. No one actually knew what purpo se the fortune had been meant to serve, or who controlled it. Possibly, the money had been socked away as a hedge against Germany's defeat. Bush and his partners at Brown Brothers Harriman in formed the government regula- tors that the account, opened in the late 1930s, wa s \"an unpaid courtesy for a client. The situation,\" wrote Kranish, \"grew more serious when the government seized Union's assets under the Trading with the Enemy Act, the sort of a ction that could have ruined Bush's political dreams.\" The phrase was an ominous one. The client was believed to be a friend of Charles L indbergh, according to Roland Harriman. Prescott Bush acted quickly and openly on behalf of the firm, served well by a reputation that had never been compromised. He ma de available all records and all documents. Viewed six decades later in the era of s erial corporate scandals and shattered careers, he received what can be viewed as the ulti mate clean bill. A decade later when he ran for the Senate, his invo lvement in the bank went untouched by the press or his political opponents. Earlier that year he had accepted the chairmanship of the USO (United Service Organizations.) He traveled the country over the ne xt two years raising millions for the National War Fund and, as the Boston Globe noted, \"p utting himself on the national stage for the first time ... (and) boosting the mor ale of U.S. troops.\" Out of adversity good things came. Again the other companies are conveniently ignored and new facts appear out of thin air and a theme is laid down. Mr. Herskowit z doesn't cite any known 206"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"P RESCOTT B USH AND THE U NION B ANKING C ORPORATION sources for this new information. He cites the Kran ish article but does not cite the Herald-Tribune or any other contemporaneous acc ounts; he says he had ac- cess to 46-hours of taped interviews and scrapbooks from the Bush family and mentions archives at the University of Connecticut. So we do not know where he gathered this particular new information. We do know that it is incorrect and misleading. Let us examine the story: First off the Herald-Tribune article didn't appear in July of 1942 it was actu- ally printed in July of 1941. The article itself pr oved to be quite the challenge to find. I talked with several different researchers a nd none had been able to find it, although spending hours looking at microfilm. Since , there was never a complete date given, just July, 1942, researchers were havin g to look at the whole month of July and when it wasn't found there, began looki ng in June and August. In a July 2003, call to Mr. Kranish at the Globe I was told that \"several other people\" had called him telling him that they were \" unable to find it.\" That there wasn't a complete date reference on the Herald-Trib une article because the article — he had found it in an \"archive of archives\" — was cut out and there was not a full date just a month and year. He said he was s ure it was July 1942. I asked Mike, if it was a special edition and if I could fi nd out where this archive was? He said, \"The Herald-Tribune doesn't exist anymore and it is hard to find, you are just going to have to take my word for it. The story definitely appeared.\" He then excused himself as being busy, that he had wri tten the story over two years ago and he needed to go. Well, we have found proof that the article did inde ed appear — in July of 1941. First we found on Alex Jones' infowars.com website an article from the July 31, 1941, Zanesville Signal'in Ohio. The Thyssen/Union Banking news story was in an INS (International News Service) wire report, wh ich says that it was \"disclosed today in a news story in the New York Journal Ameri can. We then found, at ancestry.com, an AP wire report in the Sheboygan Pr ess, a Wisconsin newspaper of August 1, 1941 which stated: \"The Herald-Tribune said Thursday [July, 31, 1941], that Fritz Thyssen, German industrialist cre dited with helping finance Adolf Hitler's rise to power, 'has $3,000,000 in Am erican cash salted away in the bank vaults of downtown New York.'\" Armed with the correct date, we were then able to find both the New York Herald-Tribune and N ew York Journal American stories. The articles are presented in full later i n this chapter. So, big deal, what difference does a year make? Wel l, let's see — in July of 1941 — when the article was really printed, there was no declared war, and the story al- lows the rehabilitation of Prescott's honor by allo wing him to \"enhance his stature\" before the revealing newspaper article, instead of after. The truth of the matter, that Prescott was possibly running for cover in Feb ruary 1942, by serving as the national chairman of USO, is not broached and the s candal is covered-up. 207"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY What \"embarrassment\" Prescott may have felt isn't k nown. The incident isn't discussed in his oral history interviews nor were t here any contemporaneous news articles except for the one flurry in July/Aug ust 1941 and the articles that mention his name do so without any personal comment s. Neither establishment historians nor the mainstream media have dealt with the episode in any depth. Sutton's works and others have been quietly ignored for years, it is only the power of the Internet that has brought forth the story. In the History Of The Class Of 1917 Yale College, V olume V— Twenty-Fifth Record printed in 1942, Prescott proudly proclaims his directorship of the Union Banking Corporation, listing it third behind CBS an d The Dresser Manufactur- ing Company and ahead of six other substantial comp anies. He had been on the bank's board since 1934, his father-in-law was a founder and had been the bank's president. It really wasn't a bank per se, b ut acted has a holding company for Thyssen, the German Steel Trust and its related components in their dealings with American industrial and financial markets. It allowed the Thyssen interests to raise money, sell and buy goods in America and t hen use Union Banking Corporation as their reciprocal bank to transfer mo nies back and forth. And the theme of poor of diligent, naive Prescott a nd partners being flummoxed by Charles Lindbergh into such a position of \"embar rassment\" — is unfounded blame-shifting. The statements by Mr. Herskowitz of \"[n]o one actually knew for what purpose the fortune had been meant to serv e, or who controlled it\" and \"that the account [was] opened in late 1930's\" are incorrect and disingenuous at best. The bank had working relations with the Thyss en interests since the 1920's and Prescott would have had access to information c oncerning business. Prescott had been a director of the bank since the early 193 0s and he was \"running the business\" at Brown Brothers Harriman at the time of the scandal. In Prescott's own words, from the Columbia University oral histor y: \"... the partners, like myself and Knight Wooley, who became — certainly af ter Lovett went to Wash- ington in 1940 — from then on, we were really runni ng the business, the day to day business, all the administrative decisions a nd the executive decisions. We were the ones that did it.\" The Union Banking Corporation was capitalized at $4 00,000 (most of the stock held by Roland Harriman) and acted as a repos itory for Thyssen's funds earned in the United States.

Or was it some sort of controlled leakag e? Over a third of the article consists of the letters to and from the Superintend ent of Banks of the State of New York which give some \"patriotic\" cover for the Brown Brothers Harriman partners. The article also sets out doctored facts, some in the bold subheads, such as \"Enlisted Harriman in 1925, that is even contrad icted in the newsstory. The theme of the Herald-Tribune article is a \"chance\" m eeting, that it may be or not be that bad or duped Thyssen's fault, that no compe nsation was received and how above-board and approved the whole affair is fr om the government's view. The use of controlled scandal to deflect and cover- up deeper scandal has been used many times in US political life and it sometim es even gets a reporter off an editor's back. The story runs and is forgotten. No matter what the reason, the reportage was quietl y stifled. With Luce's Time-Life combine, Harriman's position at Newsweek and other Bones influenced media such as CBS, the New York Times and others, t he scandal was effectively killed as an item of news. There was no coverage of the Herald-Tribune article 's information on the Thyssen/Union Banking Corporation connection in the national news weeklies, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal ox even the New York Daily Worker. The afternoon daily, Hearst-owned J ournal-Americans article was basically a condensed re-hash of the earlier Herald Tribune art icles. The next known mention of the Union Banking Corpora tion in the news was the cryptic one sentence in the December 16, 1944 N ew York Times* financial pages saying that: The Union Banking Corporation, 39 Broadway, New Yor k, has received authority to change its principal place of business to 120 Broadway. The real story continued to be suppressed.

Maybe that power to suppress, to fabricate, to deny everything and to explain nothing was why Prescott was so blase and felt no n eed to hide from his peers his directorship in a company that had already been rep orted by the New York press to be holding $3 million dollars in Nazi funds, pri or to him putting the \"bite\" on classmates as the National Chairman in Charge of the 1942 Fund Drive for the USO. The next mention of Thyssen in the news were review s in newspapers, and in magazines, such as Time, Newsweek and Nation, for t he book, I Paid for Hitler, by Fritz Thyssen. In Bonesman Henry Luce's Time mag azine October 13, 1941 it was reported that a co-writer, Emery Reeves a jo urnalist, who in April of 1940 met with Thyssen in Paris and persuaded Thyssen to go to Monte Carlo with Reeves, \"a collaborator and a secretary.\" Where Thy ssen would \"dictate three solid hours every day, then revised and approved th e copy.\" In late May 1940. Reeves went \"to Paris to check so me names and dates.\" As the Germans were also on their way to Paris. Reeves left France for Britain on a British destroyer. \"He never saw or heard from Thys sen again. After more than a year, it seemed obvious that Thyssen was a captive; for if he were free, he would have communicated with his family in South America. Alive or dead, he was Reeves decided, beyond the power of the book to hur t or help. So Reeves decided to publish.\" The book has Thyssen pounding his head and mutterin g \"'Ein Dummkopfwar ich!' (What a dumbhead I was')\" and reports about T hyssen's financial assistance to Hitler prior to the Beer Hall Putsch of 1923. Th e Thyssen role in financing Hitler is covered extensively in other chapters, so we will not recount that history here. A new revelation in the book was the novel co nspiracy theory that Adolph Hitler was the illegitimate son of Baron Rothschild . I Paid for Hitler was published in New York, by Farrar & Rinehart. Chairman of the Board of Farrar & Rinehart was John Chipman Farrar a member of the 1918 cell o f the Order of Skull & Bones. The class that had been tapped by Prescott's Bones cell. The 1918 Bones cell included US Congressman Malcolm Baldridge, CIA personnel Director F. Trubee Davison, mega-businessman Artemus Gates and the then, in 1941, Asst. Secretary of War and Brown Brothers Harriman partne r Robert A Lovett. They had all been part of the famous Palm Beach, Florida , Yale WW I flying unit. John C Farrar during WW II was a member of the Psyc hological Warfare Branch in the Office of War Information and was an editor for some of the OWI propaganda publications. After the war, Thyssen \"denied authorship\" of I Pai d for Hitler. Was there more to the book than met the eye? Was I Paid for H itler created to confuse and possibly rehabilitate certain individuals and diffu se and confuse situations in the war-charged American atmosphere of the early 1940s?

Prescott definitely understood this and it seems as though he and Brown Brothers Harriman were trying to keep the scandal in the dar k— before some newshound broke the soon to be squashed news — because in the July 31,1941, New York Herald- Tribune it says that seven months before, in January of 1941, Brown Brothers Harriman partner and Bonesman, Knight Wooley had written to the NY State Banking Board Superintendent that \"[s]hould the United States enter the war, the y [the Union Banking Corporation American directors] felt they might be under some e mbarrassment, ... .\" Kept in the dark it was and Prescott won a special election in 1952, after the death of a sitting Senator, to serve as a US Senato r from Connecticut. General Dwight Eisenhower, whom Prescott in November of 195 1, had urged to run for the Republican party nomination for President o f the US was also elected. Prescott golfed with President Eisenhower often, an d spent a half-hour alone with him on Ike's last day as President. Senator Bush served on the Banking Committee, many times as a contact person for World Bank and Federal Reserve officials , who sometimes looked for more casual places to do business than the Senate c ommittee rooms. In his second term — protecting his state's interests — Prescott also served as a member of the Armed Service Committee. For years Connecticut had received more per capita of the defense dollar than any other state earning itself the sobriquet, the \"Arsenal of Democracy.\" That the Military-Industrial Complex began in Connecticut in the 1800s is relevant ... but another tale. Prescott was a member of two private clubs in Washi ngton, the Alibi Club and the Alfalfa Club. Every presidential election seaso n, the Alfalfa Club nominates one of its members in jest to run for President of the United States. In January 1959 Senator Bush was the nominee for Alfalfa Party . His acceptance speech was recorded and a transcript was included, by the Senator's request, in his oral history given to Columbia University. In this speec h Prescott says: I recall here the immortal words of Granville Rice, when he wrote: The rules of life apply the same To any sport you choose It matters not how you play the game, So long as you never lose.

What was left was as goo d as dead and was broadcast at the ultimate impossible hour of 5 PM on a Friday aftern oon as every possible viewer is in traffic going home. There never was a rerun. The reason we had to, well, kill our 'child,' was because the new head of the documentary department at that time could not stand behind our findings. Even though they were based on facts and told by ex perts. There was also a cultural difference. The new head was just recently promoted to this doc umentary department from a news section that made very factual clips of maximum five minute s: 'There is a fire and two people died.' Whilst our documentary was about 'who lit the fire and why?' We had made a documentary — which is a view on reality based on facts — of on e hour and twenty minutes and with a subject that is beyond the frame of mind of many pe ople consuming the news that they are fed. This combination of events was the end of our docum entary as such. Making the program was quite an experience, not the least because of all the spooks we had to deal with for the CIA-drugs segment. When we fir st started in 1995 there was no Internet, just some old stencils of a hard to find book of a man k nown by only a few and the few who knew him. thought Antony Sutton was dead or lived on a high m ountain. To communicate there was the fax and the telephone. In 1996 the Internet came (for u s at least) but information on Skull & Bones was still hard to find. Try to explain that to anyo ne typing in \"Skull and Bones\" in Google today and getting swamped in information. The subject of Bones and all these kinds of institut ions and people was a real eye opener. As a matter of fact, it changed my life and made me see the world completely different. So much different that many times things are one hundr ed percent different than they seem. Not just ten of sixty percent, but really one hundred p ercent, turned upside down. On the one hand the subject of Skull & Bones became less 'dark ,' because we found out the society is not some sort of spooky world government, on the other hand it became darker, because these Bones-like institutions and their members show a bru te force and an enormous concentrated power that is overwhelming and could make anyone ve ry cynical very easily. That also must be a reason people like to stay away from these realit ies. Since corresponding and meeting with Antony Sutton he is my greatest example. He was just a player in the game that has to be played, bu t he played his role very well. He made a difference. I was then and still am 'in the researc h business', as Antony called it, digging deeper as ever, but it is extremely difficult to find reso urces to make new documentaries on the subjects I specialize in. Very frustrating, because the mark et is there. It's just not easy convincing the people who have the funds about this fact.

In the tides of economic warfare now surging over the world, the New York Herald Tribune, has discovered that Fritz Thyssen, the German industrialist who was Adolf Hitlers original patron on a prodigal scale a decade has $3,000,000 in Ameri- can cash, salted away in the bank vaults of downtown New York. In the American colony of Thyssen en- terprises perhaps the most interesting is, the Union Banking Corporation, 39 Broadway, nominal guardian of the $3,000,000 cache, all in United States currency — a sort of nest egg for Herr Thyssen or perhaps for some of his high-placed Nazi friends when the present troublous days are over. Among other Thyssen interests in New York are half a dozen corporations engaged in the shipping, export and import trades, centering chiefly about coal and steel indus- tries and operating under the wing of the Union Banking Corporation. These organi- zations did a thriving business in rolling up dollars for Herr Thyssen in years past, but have been brought virtually to a standstill during the last year by the war. One of the most fascinating aspects of this story is the mystery surrounding the Thyssen fortune. At the moment, of course, no can get at this Thyssen nest egg, because it is part of the $4,500,000,000 foreign assets frozen by the United States government since Adolf Hitlers armies began overrunning Europe. Government circles assert that the as- sets of the Union Banking Corporation and its subsidiaries were frozen because capital and control came from Nether- lands institution called the, Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart (Bank for Trade, and Shipping) in Rotterdam one of the Thyssen string of banking houses on the Continent. It was subject to the freezing order, however, as a Dutch corporation and not as a German-owned property. As the Custodian of all Dutch property outside the Netherlands, the Netherlands government in exile represents that it, too, would seem to have some rights in the, matter. Nevertheless all of Fritz Thyssen's properties were confiscated by the Nazi regime back in 1939, and thus it might appear that the assets here are legally a part of the German government's assets in the United States. Rotterdam Bank Bombed The Thyssen bank in Rotterdam which nominally owned the New York corpora- tion was bombed out of existence by the invading Nazis in May, 1940. No one in New York professes to know what has happened to the officers of the Rotterdam institution. Not a word of instruction or advice has come from abroad. Perhaps it wasn't Herr Thyssen's money at all, some persons suggest. Maybe he sent it here for safekeeping for some of the Nazi bigwigs — perhaps for Goering, for Goeb- bels, for Himmler, or even Hitler himself. No matter how the story comes out, the United States government has the situation in hand. Every penny of known Thyssen as- sets is frozen, under the strictest control. There are many Americans in respon- sible positions who do not think that the rift between Herr Thyssen and the Nazi- was genuine at all, preferring to believe that Thyssen was in reality a sort of eco- nomic advance agent of the Hitler forces, a financial surveyor and softener-up posing as a refugee. Reliable private information is that Thyssen has been wandering about Switzer- land, France and other European countries before and after the Nazi armies arriving without much hindrance, from the Hitler government. Thyssen is now in Germany — not under confinement, free to move 214 New York Herald- Tribune, July 31, 1941 T HYSSEN H AS $3,000,000 C ASH IN N EW Y ORK V AULTS Union Banking Corp.

Herr Thyssen's adventure in the Ameri- can business world dates back to August, 1924, when without flourishes or ruffles the Union Banking Corporation was incorpo- rated with a capital stock of $400,000, the money coming from the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart, of Rotterdam. It was li- censed under the New York State banking laws as an investment corporation. In addition to known lieutenants of the Thyssen interests in Europe, there appeared and continue to appear on the board of directors of this corporation the names of several partners of the private banking house of Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., 59 Wall Street. Enlisted Harriman In 1925 This circumstance dates back to a chance meeting in Europe in 1925 between Fritz Thyssen and W Averell Harriman, a partner of the Brown Brothers, Harriman firm and now minister plenipotentiary to England as expediter of lease-lend aid to the British. Herr Thyssen said to Mr. Har- riman that he was opening a bank in the United States to take care of his financial and industrial interests here and, asked Mr. Harriman to serve on the board. Mr. Harri- man agreed to have several other members of his firm, go on the directorate. This took place, of course, at a time when the present world tangle could hardly have been foreseen and when such courtesies were part of the normal routine of international banking relations. When a new world war began the Brown Brothers Harriman partners sensed possible embarrassment through association with a corporation stemming from German in- terests and considered withdrawal from the Union Banking Corporation's board. In a consultation with William R. White, State Superintendent of Banks, on the subject Mr. White requested them to remain on the board to assure efficient administration of the corpo- ration's affairs by trustworthy and responsible persons during the emergency. They agreed to comply with Mr. White's request. Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. have never had any financial interest in the Union Banking Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, and have never profited in any way from its activities. The association of some of its partners with the Thyssen corporation, it points, out, was entirely a matter of courtesy. Relationship Explained The circumstances of relationship were frankly set forth in a letter addressed by Knight Woolley, a partner of the, Brown Brothers Harriman firm, to Mr. White on Jan. 14 of this year. This letter follows: \"January 14, 1941. \"William R. White, Esq., \"Superintendent of Banks, State Of New York, 80 Centre Street, \"New York, N, Y. \"'Dear Mr. White: \"As you are aware, my partners, E. R. Harriman, Ray Morris, Prescott S. Bush and our manager, H. D. Pennington, are directors of the Union Banking Corpora- tion, a state institution under your super- vision. This corporation is located, at 39 Broadway, and it is in effect a New York office, or agency, of the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart, in Rotterdam. Because of possible uncertainty as to whether the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart might be held to be a Dutch institution, or whether it is, in fact, a German institution under a Dutch name, my partners have been giving serious consideration to withdrawing from the board. Should the United States enter the war, they feel they might be under some embarrassment because of their connection with the bank, even though we have no financial interest in the Union Banking 215"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Corporation, nor do we participate in its earnings. They act as directors merely as a matter of business courtesy. \"In order that you may understand clearly the reasons for our doubts, I should like to give you the background of our connection with the Union Banking Corporation. Our partner W.A. Harriman was in Europe in 1925, and at that time he became acquainted with Mr. Fritz Thyssen, the German industrialist. To the best of my knowledge, Mr. Thyssen formed the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart and presum- ably controlled that institution. At one of his meetings with Mr. Harriman, he told him he was forming a bank in New York to look after his interests in the United States and he asked Mr. Harriman to serve on the board. Mr. Harriman agreed that certain of his associates would serve in this capac- ity, and as a result various members of the Harriman organizations and now of Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., have been on the board ever since. \"The Union Banking Corporation does no commercial business, and its only depositor is the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart. Its activities are limited to oc- casional payments and a few purchases and sales of securities. All shares of the Union Banking Corporation are registered in the name of E. R. Harriman, who is chair- man of the board, except the qualifying shares held by directors. As the company is Dutch-owned, its banking accounts were frozen under the Presidential Proclamation of May 10, 1940. \"The Union Banking Corporation maintains accounts with the Chase Na- tional Bank, the National City Bank, the Guaranty Trust Company, and ourselves. At present its account with us is the only one which is active, and the drawings are limited to the Payment of salaries and usual office expenses. To further control its op- erations, we have arranged that either Ray Morris or H. D. Pennington must sign checks jointly with the president of the company, Mr. C. Lievense, or with the, assistant treasurer, Mr. W Kauffmann, and that one of our gentleman from our organization must be present when access is desired to the company's safe deposit box at the Chase Bank. \"You have perhaps read in the newspa- pers recently that, Fritz Thyssen is no longer in Germany, and it has been reported that he has had differences with the Nazi regime. We have no knowledge as to whether he still retains an interest in the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart, nor are we able to obtain any information with respect to the stock ownership in the bank. \"In view, of these uncertainties, together with the censorship affecting communica- tions to and from Rotterdam, I realize that the Union Banking Corporation might be placed in an embarrassing position if all the directors were to resign at this time. I feel sure however that you will understand the position of my Associates, and I would greatly appreciate, a frank expression from you as to the action which you feel that they should take should you believe that the interests of the Banking Department would be best served by their continuing as directors until the situation abroad has been somewhat clarified, I know that they will be glad to be guided by, your judgment and I shall greatly appreciate your reaction to this situation and your opinion as to what action, if any, should be taken by my associates.

Mr. Lievense would reveal little of the operations of the corporations beyond saying that they are now under the strict supervision of the Treasury Department and that there was \"very little activity.\" He insisted, however, that Religious Publications, Inc., although occupying of- fices with the Union Banking Corporation and the others, was not a Thyssen venture but was purely his personal affair. \"This is a philanthropic venture of mine,\" he explained with disarming sincer- ity, \"undertaken to bring out the religious works of Dr. K Schilder, a Dutchman who has recently been released from a German concentration camp. This is in no sense a profit-making venture and must not be associated with these other business organizations.\" Three of Dr. Schilder's books have been, brought out by the William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, of Grand Rapids, Mich., and were translated from the Dutch by Henry Zylstra. They bear the titles, \"Christ In His Suffering, \"Christ on Trial\" and \"Christ Crucified.\" On Other, Thyssen, Boards Mr. Lievense speaks in soft, low tones and merely smiled broadly when questioned about his association with Herr Thyssen. His name appears as a director of the Thyssen Holland American Investment Corporation, at Rotterdam. He is a member of the board of the August Thyssen Bank, Aktiengesell- schaft, at Berlin, and, he is also a director of the Handelscompagnie Ruilvkeer, a Thyssen bartering company at Amsterdam. Two of Mr. Lievense's associates, on the board of the Union Banking Corporation,, J. G. Groeninger and N.J. Kouwenhoven, are among Herr Thyssen's chief manage- rial assistants in the conduct of many of his European Projects. Kouwenhoven is an old school friend of Mr. Lievense and is managing director of the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart. He is also man- aging director of the Holland American Investment Corporation and is on the board of the Thyssen-owned Vlaardingen Harborworks. Groeninger is managing director of the Thyssen-owned Halcyon Line, with headquarters at Rotterdam. It was this corporation which refused to transfer its headquarters and assets outside Holland when the Netherlands government warned all industrialists to take their properties to Dutch colonies at the time of the Nazi In- vasion. Just before the arrival of the Ger- man forces at Rotterdam, the British and Dutch navies seized eleven of the thirteen ships of the line and incorporated them in the British shipping pool. It is understood that three of these ships have since been destroyed. Only two ships of the line fell into the Nazis, hands. Only One Has Visited U. S. Both Groeninger and Kouwenhoven are directors of the local Holland American Trading Corporation. Groeninger is also on the board of the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart and is a director of the Vulcan Rhine Shipping Co., another unit in Thys- sen's industrial kingdom.

It is anybody's guess whether he is a genuine refugee from the Nazi terror or a Hitler agent wrapped in a fugitive's cloak. The world at large does not know where he is or even whether he is alive. And it has, apparently, no way of finding out. On March 17 it was reported in Vichy. France, that he had been arrested on the Riv- iera in December, returned to Germany and lodged behind the barbed wire of Dachau concentration camp. Four days later German authorities announced that he was not in France or in Dachau but in South America. Earlier this month informed sources in Ger- many said he had been released from custody and was in a German sanatorium enjoying \"limited freedom of movement.\" Contradictory reports of Herr Thyssen's status are not new in the history of the man who, more than any other, financed Hitler's rise to power. Since 1934 vague rumors of breaks between Thyssen and Hitler have circulated from time to time. They came to a head on Nov. 11, 1939, when it was announced that he had left Germany for Switzerland \"for an indefinite stay.\" The next day he arrived in Lucerne and for several months kept correspondents regard- ing his hints that he quit his country after protesting against the Nazi-Soviet pact and urging Hitler through Hermann Wilhelm Goering, not to go to war. Property Confiscated A week after his arrival in Switzerland it was announced in Berlin with fanfare that the Reich had confiscated his fortune and proper- ty estimated to be worth at least $88,000,000. It was done on the basis of a law aimed at persons inimical to the people and the state. On Feb. 12, 1940, a decree was published in the official German gazette stripping him and his wife of their citizenship. They were then living In luxury in a Locarno hotel. From then until his disappearance from the Riviera his movements were of a nature to arouse suspicion, or at least puzzlement. 219"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY He was in Belgium in March, 1940, and within a few weeks Hitler's armies forced the surrender of that country. From Bel- gium he moved to France, where he re- mained unmolested long after the French bowed before Hitler's legions. Thyssen's residence at the Hotel Crillon in Paris while the German armies gathered in front of the, Maginot Line puzzled the Parisians. It seemed strange to them that a man who was a declared enemy of France and the prime mover of Hitler's coup should be ensconced in the French capital at that particular time, able to get the ear not only of French industrialists but also of French politicians. The same puzzlement arose after the French surrender when Thyssen suppos- edly an enemy of the Reich was allowed to sun himself for months on the sands of Cannes, although the German authorities could have had him for the asking. Mentioned as Roehm Associate All this maneuvering was an echo of in earlier incident in his career. In 1934 after Hitler had assumed the Chancellorship with the staunch help of Thyssen, Berlin began to buzz with rumors of a split among the Nazis. It was also said that Thyssen was seen frequently in the company of Captain Ernst Roehm, one of the leaders of the supposed plot against the Fuehrer. In the blood bath of July 30, 1934, when Hitler purged his party by killing Roehm and others, there was no mention of Thyssen's having a part in the conspiracy. Yet, when he sailed in August for South America, it was reported that he was fleeing. Despite his intimacy with Roehm however, Thyssen ap- parently suffered none of Hitler's suspicion. After studying the steel business of South America, he returned in the spring to Ger- many and took up where he had left off. In the various accounts of the string-pulling responsible for Hitler's rise in Germany, there in no suggestion that Thyssen shelled out his marks to the Nazi party for any reasons but selfish ones. He was firm believer In capitalism so far as capitalism was represented by the palatial Thyssen chateau, the roaring Thyssen steel furnaces in the Ruhr and Rhine valleys and the 120,000 workers who owed their daily bread to the Thyssen pay rolls. Hitler's main appeal to him was as a defender of Capital- ism against tile Bolshevik bogey. The Thyssen holdings were hard hit in the German inflation and the subsequent struggle of German industry against the restrictions imposed under the Versailles Treaty. Thyssen hated the French, dis- trusted the German Republic and dreaded socialism. He began to look around for an antidote to the three-headed monster of his imagination. In 1927 he found it in the person an Austrian former house painter. Started Pushing In '30 Thyssen kept an eye on Hitler and, when the depression in 1930 rocked the Thyssen industrial empire, decided that it was time to push the Nazi leader. He introduced him to prominent industrialists, promised them that Hitler's National Socialism was only window dressing and helped to pry money for the cause from their pockets. In 1930 he and a business associate distributed 1,000,000 marks to the party and two years later, before the fateful presidential election leading to Hitler's Chancellorship, Thyssen donated 3,000,000 more. His reward was to be made economic dictator of western Germany and a mem- ber of the Reich's Grand Economic Council and Prussian State Council. He also had a seat in the Reichstagg. If the version that would picture him tossed over by Hitler is correct, he mistook his man when he patronizingly gathered the Fuehrer under his wing, His idea was to guide Hitler in the paths of safety for the Thyssen fortune. Like other German industrialists with same thought, however, it would appear that his supported puppet turned out to be a Frankenstein monster. 220"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Thyssen Fund Of $3,000,000 Found Here His Nazi nest egg in Uncle Sam's cold storage. Existence of a $3,000,000 fund es- tablished here by Fritz Thyssen, German industrialist and original backer of Adolf Hitler at the beginning of the latter's rise to power, was disclosed today. \"Whether the money is for Thyssen personally, or, perhaps, for some of his high-placed Nazi friends in the event of an \"emergency\" compelling them to leave Germany, no one knew. However, it will do neither Thyssen nor any of his Nazi friends any good now, as it has been \"frozen\" along with the $4,500,000,000 Axis assets now held in this country. INVESTMENT COMPANY. The money exists in funds of the Union Banking Corporation, an investment com- pany incorporated and licensed under new York State laws in August, 1924. Money for its $400,000 capital stock came from Thyssen's Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart in Rotterdam. Among members of its board of direc- tors are E. R. Harriman, Ray Morris and Prescott S. Bush, partner in the firm of Brown Brothers Harriman & Company, of which W. Averell harriman is now Ameri- can minister plenipotentiary to England. Also a director is H. D. Pennington, Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. man- ager. On Jan. 14, 1941, Knight Woolley, another partner in the harriman company, wrote to State Banking Superintendent William R. White in behalf of Harriman, Morris, Bush and Pennington. \"Should the United States enter the war, they feel they might be under some embarrassment because of their connec- tion with the bank, even thought we have no financial interest in the Union Banking Corporation, nor do we participate in its earnings,\" Woolley wrote. SEEKS STEPS TO TAKE He asked White for \"a frank expression from you as to the action\" the Harriman directors should take. Their own impulse, he indicated, was to resign en masse from Thyssen's bank. White, however, replied on May 13: \"While the department would not feel free to object if your partners, Mr. Harri- man, Mr. Morris and Mr. Bush, and your firm's manager, Mr. Pennington, should desire to resign as directors of the corpora- tion, nevertheless the department would be gratified if these gentlemen could find it possible to remain on the board during this period of uncertainty.\" He plainly indicated that he considered it best, if Thyssen or other Nazi money was tied up in the Union Banking Corporation, to keep the corporation under Harriman's Morris's, Bush's and Pennington's control, thus effectively checkmating whatever Thyssen's plan might be. All of the shares of the Union Banking Corporation are registered in the name of E. R. Harriman, who is chairman of the board, except the qualifying shares held by other directors. Mr. Woolley related the circumstances leading to the selection of the Harriman partners on the board of directors. He said: 'BUSINESS COURTESY.' \"Our partner, W A. Harriman, was in Europe in 1925 and at that time he became acquainted with Fritz Thyssen. \"To the best of my knowledge, Thys- sen formed the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart, and presumably controlled that institution. 222"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"P RESCOTT B USH AND THE U NION B ANKING C ORPORATION \"At one of his meetings with Mr. Harri- man he told him he was forming a bank in New York to look after his interests in the United States, and he asked Mr. harriman to serve on the board. \"Mr. Harriman agreed that certain of his associates would serve in this capacity, and as a result various members of the Har- riman organization, now Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., have been on the board ever since.\" Mr. Woolley emphasized that these di- rectors act \"merely as a matter of business courtesy.\" President of the Union Banking Corp. is Cornells Lievense, Holland-born, who came to the United States by way of Mon- treal in May, 1926, two years after the bank was set up. He is now a naturalized American citizen, having received his final papers in Mineola, L. I., Jan. 29, 1932. He is president also of the Domestic Fuel Corp., Seamless Steel Equipment Corp., and Holland-American Trading Corp., all of which share the Union Bank- ing Corp.'s offices at 39 Broadway. ASSETS FROZEN The assets of all three of these firms also have been \"frozen\" by the U. S. Govern- ment, Lievense admitted. Last Fall, the Canadian Government blacklisted the Domestic Fuel Corp., which had been bringing coal from Thyssen's Eu- ropean mines to Canada. Also housed in the same offices with the bank are the Kemari Trading Corp., Riberena Fuel Y Chartering Co. Religious Publications, Inc., and Kauffmann & Co. Reached early today at his home on Ce- dar Swamp Road in the Glen Hills Farm section of Glen Head, L. I., Lievense said: \"I have nothing to say. I have no com- ment to make on anything, especially when I'm asleep.\" Besides the Harriman officers on the board of the Union Banking Corp., there are J. G. Groeninger and N. J. Kouwen- hoven. Kouwenhoven is managing director of the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart, managing director of the Holland-Ameri- can Investment Corp., and a member of the board of the Thyssen-owned Vlaardingsen Harborworks. Groeninger is managing director of the Thyssen-owned Halcyon Line, which re- fused to obey the Netherlands government's order to all industries to remove their prop- erties to the Dutch colonies, just before the Nazi invasion.\" Thyssen himself, according to best ob- tainable advices, is now back in Germany. For a time he wandered about Switzerland, France and other European countries. His present status is said to be that of, perhaps, a willing prisoner, not in confinement but under surveillance, perhaps a hostage for his wealth throughout the world."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY The next two and a-half pages are from the History of the Yale Class of 1917, Twenty-Fifth Record - 19 42 Prescott Sheldon Bush Business: General Partner in the firm of Brown Br others Harriman & Co.

The funding of Hitler and the Nazi movement has yet to be explored in exhaustive depth. The only published examination of Hitler's personal finances is an article by Oron James Hale, \"Adolph Hitler: Taxpayer,\" 1 which records Adolph's brushes with the German tax authorities before he became Reichskanzler. In the 1920s Hitler presented himself to the Ger- man tax man as merely an impoverished writer living on bank loans, with an automobile bought on credit. Unfortunately, the original records used by Hale do not yield the source of Hitler's income, loans, or credit, and German law \"did not require self-employed or profes sional persons to dis- close in detail the sources of income or the nature of services rendered.\" 2 Obviously the funds for the automobiles, private se cretary Rudolf Hess, another assistant, a chauffeur, and expenses incurr ed by political activity, came from somewhere. But, like Leon Trotsky's 1917 stay in New York, it a hard to reconcile Hitler's known expenditures wit h the precise source of his income. Some Early Hitler Backers We do know that prominent European and American ind ustrialists were sponsoring all manner of totalitarian politica l groups at that time, including Communists and various Nazi groups. The U .S Kilgore Com- mitee records that: By 1919 Krupp was already giving financial aid to o ne of the reactionary political groups which sowed the seed o f the present Nazi ideology. Hugo Stinnes was an early contributo r to the Nazi Party (National Socialistische Deutsche Arbeiter Pa rtei). By 1924 other prominent industrialists and financiers, amon g them Fritz Thyssen, Albert Voegler, Adolph [sic] Kirdorf, and Kurt von Schroder, were secretly giving substantial sums to the Nazis.

The m ost interesting name from this period is that of Emil Kirdorf, who had e arlier acted as conduit for financing German involvement in the Bolshevik R evolution. 4 Kirdorf's role in financing Hitler was, in his own words: In 1923 I came into contact for the first time with the National-Socialist movement. . . . I first heard th e Fuehrer in the Essen Exhibition Hall. His clear exposition com pletely con- vinced and overwhelmed me. In 1927 I first met the Fuehrer personally. I travelled to Munich and there had a c onversation with the Fuehrer in the Bruckmann home. During four and a half hours Adolf Hitler explained to me his program me in de- tail. I then begged the Fuehrer to put together the lecture he had given me in the form of a pamphlet. I then dist ributed this pamphlet in my name in business and manufacturing c ircles. Since then I have placed myself completely at the d is- position of his movement. Shortly after our Munich conver- sation, and as a result of the pamphlet which the F uehrer com- posed and I distributed, a number of meetings took place be- tween the Fuehrer and leading personalities in the field of indus- try. For the last time before the taking over of po wer, the leaders of industry met in my house together with Adolf Hit ler, Rudolf Hess, Hermann Goering and other leading personaliti es of the party. 5 In 1925 the Hugo Stinnes family contributed funds t o convert the Nazi weekly Volkischer Beobachter to a daily public ation. Putzi Hanf- staengl, Franklin D. Roosevelt's friend and protege , provided the remain- ing funds. 6 Table 7-1 summarizes presently known financial con tributions and the business associations of contributors from the United States. Putzi is not listed in Table 7-1 as he was neither indust rialist nor financier. In the early 1930s financial assistance to Hitler b egan to flow more readily.

The critical point is that the German industrialists financing Hitler were predominantly directors of cartels with American asso- ciations, ownership, participation, or some form of subsidiary connection. The Hitler backers were not, by and large, firms of purely German origin, or representative of German family business. Except for Thyssen and Kir- dorf, in most cases they were the German multi-nati onal firms — i.e.,I.G. Farben, A.E.G., DAPAG, etc. These multi-nationals h ad been built up by American loans in the 1920s, and in the early 1930s had American di- rectors and heavy American financial participation. One flow of foreign political funds not considered here is that reported from the European-based Royal Dutch Shell, Standard Oil's great competitor in the 20s and 30s, and the giant brainchild of Anglo- Dutch businessman Sir Henri Deterding. It has been widely asserted that Henri Deterding personally financed Hitler. This ar gument is made, for instance, by biographer Glyn Roberts in The Most Po werful Man in the World. Roberts notes that Deterding was impressed w ith Hitler as early as 1921: ... and the Dutch press reported that, through the agent Georg Bell, he [Deterding] had placed at Hitler's d isposal, while the party was \"still in long clothes,\" no les s than four million guilders. 7 It was reported (by Roberts) that in 1931 Georg Bel l, Deterding's agent, attended meetings of Ukrainian Patriots in P aris \"as joint delegate of Hitler and Deterding.\" 8 Roberts also reports: Deterding was accused, as Edgar Ansell Mowrer testi fies in his Germany Puts the Clock Back, of putting up a la rge sum of money for the Nazis on the understanding that succe ss would give him a more favored position in the German oil market. On other occasions, figures as high as £55,000,000 wer e men- tioned. 9 Biographer Roberts really found Deterding's strong anti-Bolshevism distasteful, and rather than present hard evidence of funding he is inclined to assume rather than prove that Deterding was pro- Hitler. But pro- Hitlerism is not a necessary consequence of anti-Bo lshevism; in any event Roberts offers no proof of finance, and hard eviden ce of Deterding's involvement was not found by this author.

He later went to live in Hitler's Germany and increased his share of the German petroleum market. So there may have been some contr ibutions, but these have not been proven. Similarly, in France (on January 11, 1932), Paul Fa ure, a member of the Chambre des Deputes, accused the French industr ial firm of Schneider-Creuzot of financing Hitler — and inciden tally implicated Wall Street in other financing channels. 10 The Schneider group is a famous firm of French arma ments manufac- turers. After recalling the Schneider influence in establishment of Fascism in Hungary and its extensive international armament s operations, Paul Faure turns to Hitler, and quotes from the French p aper Le Journal, \"that Hitler had received 300,000 Swiss gold francs\" from subscriptions opened in Holland under the case of a university professor named von Bissing The Skoda plant at Pilsen, stated Paul Faure, was c ontrolled by the French Schneider family, and it was the Skoda directors vo n Duschnitz and von Arthaber who made the subscriptions to Hitler. Faur e concluded: . . . I am disturbed to see the directors of Skoda, controlled by Schneider, subsidizing the electoral campaign of M. Hitler; I am disturbed to see your firms, your financiers, yo ur industrial cartels unite themselves with the most nationalisti c of Ger- mans .... Again, no hard evidence was found for this alleged flow of Hitle- funds. Fritz Thyssen and W.A. Harriman Company of New York Another elusive case of reported financing of Hitle r is that of Fritz Thyssen, the German steel magnate who associated hi mself with the Nazi movement in the early 20s. When interrogated in 194 5 under Project Dustbin, 11 Thyssen recalled that he was approached in 1923 by General Ludendorf at the time of French evacuation of the R uhr. Shortly after this meeting Thyssen was introduced to Hitler and provid ed funds for the Nazis through General Ludendorf. In 1930-1931 Emil Kirdorf approached Thyssen and subsequently sent Rudolf Hess to negoti ate further funding for the Nazi Party.

Supposedly Hitler's grandmother, Frau Schickelgruber, had been a servant in the Rothschil d household and while there became pregnant: . . . an inquiry once ordered by the late Austrian chan- cellor, Engelbert Dollfuss, yielded some interestin g results, ow- ing to the fact that the dossiers of the police dep artment of the Austro-Hungarian monarch were remarkably complete. 14 This assertion concerning Hitler's illegitimacy is refuted entirely in a more solidly based book by Eugene Davidson, which i mplicates the Frankenberger family, not the Rothschild family. In any event, and more relevant from our viewpoint, the August Thyssen front bank in Holland — i.e., the Bank voor Handel en Scheep- vaart N.V. — controlled the Union Banking Corporati on in New York. The Harrimans had a financial interest in, and E. R oland Harriman (Averell's brother) was a director of, this Union B anking Corporation.

Thyssen's book, later repudiated, states that as much as one million mark s came from Thyssen. Thyssen's U.S. partners were, of course, prominent members of the Wall Street financial establishment. Edward Henry H arriman, the nine- teenth-century railroad magnate, had two sons, W. A verell Harriman (born in 1891), and E. Roland Harriman (born in 189 5). In 1917 W. Averell Harriman was a director of Guaranty Trust C ompany and he was involved in the Bolshevik Revolution. 16 According to his biographer, Averell started at the bottom of the career ladder as a clerk and section hand after leaving Yale in 1913, then \"he moved ste adily forward to posi- tions of increasing responsibility in the fields of transportation and fi- nance.\" 17 In addition to his directorship in Guaranty Trust, Harriman formed the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation in 191 7, which soon be- came the largest merchant fleet under American flag . This fleet was dis- posed of in 1925 and Harriman entered the lucrative Russian market. 18 In winding up these Russian deals in 1929, Averell Harriman re- ceived a windfall profit of $1 million from the usu ally hard-headed Soviets, who have a reputation of giving nothing aw ay without some pre- sent or later quid pro quo. Concurrently with these successful moves in international finance, Averell Harriman has always been attracted by so- called \"public\" service. In 1913 Harriman's \"public \" service began with an appointment to the Palisades Park Commission. In 1933 Harriman was appointed chairman of the New York State Committee of Employment. and in 1934 became Administrative Officer of Roosev elt's NRA — the Mussolini-like brainchild of General Electric's Ger ard Swope. 19 There followed a stream of \"public\" offices, first the Le nd Lease program, then as Ambassador to the Soviet Union, later as Secreta ry of Commerce. By contrast, E. Roland Harriman confined his activi ties to private business in international finance without venturing , as did brother Aver- ell, into \"public\" service. In 1922 Roland and Aver ell formed W. A. Harri- man & Company.

Nazi financier Hendrik Jozef Kouwenhoven, Roland Ha rriman's fellow-director at Union Banking Corporation in New York, was manag- ing director of the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart N.V. (BHS) of Rotterdam. In 1940 the BHS held approximately $2.2 million assets in the Union Banking Corporation, which in turn did most o f its business with BHS. 2 In the 1930s Kouwenhoven was also a director of th e Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G., the steel cartel founded with Wall Street funds in the mid-1920s. Like Baron Schroder, he was a prominent Hitler supporter. Another director of the New York Union Banking Corp oration was Johann Groeninger, a German subject with numerous i ndustrial and fi- nancial affiliations involving Vereinigte Stahlwerk e, the August Thyssen group, and a directorship of August Thyssen Hutte A .G. 21 This affiliation and mutual business interest betwe en Harriman and the Thyssen interests does not suggest that the Har rimans directly fi- nanced Hitler. On the other hand, it does show that the Harrimans were intimately connected with prominent Nazis Kouwenhov en and Groeninger and a Nazi front bank, the Bank voor Han del en Scheepvaart. There is every reason to believe that the Harrimans knew of Thyssen's support for the Nazis. In the case of the Harrimans , it is important to bear in mind their long-lasting and intimate relationshi p with the Soviet Union and the Harriman's position at the center of Roosev elt's New Deal and the Democratic Party. The evidence suggests that some m embers of the Wall Street elite are connected with, and certainly have influence with, all significant political groupings in the contemporary world socialist spec- trum — Soviet socialism, Hitler's national socialis m, and Roosevelt's New Deal socialism. Financing Hitler in the March 1933 General Election Putting the Georg Bell-Deterding and the Thyssen-Ha rriman cases to one side, we now examine the core of Hitler's ba cking. In May 1932 the so-called \"Kaiserhof Meeting\" took place between Sc hmitz of I.G. Farben, Max Ilgner of American I.G. Farben, Kiep of Hamburg-America Line, and Diem of the German Potash Trust. More tha n 500,000 marks was raised at this meeting and deposited to the cre dit of Rudolf Hess in the Deutsche Bank.

Farben contributed 100,000 RM, or one-fifth of the total. The \"Sidney Warburg\" book claims Warburg involvement in the funding of H itler, and Paul War- burg was a director of American I.G. Farben 22 while Max Warburg was a director of I.G. Farben. There exists irrefutable documentary evidence of a further role of international bankers and industrialists in the fin ancing of the Nazi Party and the Volkspartie for the March 1933 German elect ion. A total of three million Reichmarks was subscribed by prominent firm s and businessmen, suitably \"washed\" through an account at the Delbruc k Schickler Bank, and then passed into the hands of Rudolf Hess for u se by Hitler and the NSDAP. This transfer of funds was followed by the R eichstag fire, abro- gation of constitutional rights, and consolidation of Nazi power. Access to the Reichstag by the arsonists was obtained through a tunnel from a house where Putzi Hanfstaengel was staying; the Reichstag fire itself was used by Hitler as a pretext to abolish constitutional ri ghts. In brief, within a few weeks of the major funding of Hitler there was a li nked sequence of major events: the financial contribution from prominent b ankers and indus- trialists to the 1933 election, burning of the Reic hstag, abrogation of constitutional rights, and subsequent seizure of po wer by the Nazi Party. The fund-raising meeting was held February 20, 1933 in the home of Goering, who was then president of the Reichstag, w ith Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht acting as host. Among those present , according to I.G. Farben's von Schnitzler, were: Krupp von Bohlen, who, in the beginning of 1933, wa s president of the Reichsverband der Deutschen Indust rie Reich Association of German Industry; Dr. Albert Voegler, the leading man of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke; Von Loewenfeld; D r. Stein, head of the Gewerkschaft Auguste-Victoria, a mine w hich belongs to the IG. 23 Hitler expounded his political views to the assembl ed businessmen in a lengthy two-and-one-half hour speech, using the t hreat of Communism and a Communist take-over to great effect: It is not enough to say we do not want Communism in our economy. If we continue on our old political course , then we shall perish . ... It is the noblest task of the le ader to find ideals that are stronger than the factors that pull the pe ople together.

It turned out to be mo re than enough to ac- quire power, because 600,000 marks remained unexpen ded after the elec- tion. Hjalmar Schacht organized this historic meeting. We have pre- viously described Schacht's links with the United S tates: his father was cashier for the Berlin Branch of Equitable Assuranc e, and Hjalmar was intimately involved almost on a monthly basis with Wall Street. The largest contributor to the fund was I.G. Farben , which com- mitted itself for 30 percent (or 500,000 marks) of the total. Director A. Steinke, of BUBIAG (Braunkohlen-u. Brikett-Industri e A.G.), an I.G. Farben subsidiary, personally contributed another 2 00,000 marks. In brief, 45 percent of the funds for the 1933 electio n came from I.G. Farben. If we look at the directors of American I.G. Farben — the U.S. subsidiary of I.G. Farben — we get close to the roots of Wall Street involvement with Hitler. The board of American I.G. Farben at this t ime contained some of the most prestigious names among American industria lists: Edsel B. Ford of the Ford Motor Company, C.E.

The payments to Hitler in this final step on the ro ad to dictatorial Naziism were made through the private bank of Delbr uck Schickler. The Delbruck Schickler Bank was a subsidiary of Metallg esellschaft A.G.

The principal shareholders of \"Metall\" wer e I.G. Farben and the British Metal Corporation.

Usually the bl ame for financing Hitler has been exclusively placed upon Fritz Thyss en or Emil Kirdorf. In the case of Thyssen this blame was widely circulate d in a book allegedly authored by Thyssen in the middle of World War II b ut later repudiated by him. 27 Why Thyssen would want to admit such actions befor e the defeat of Naziism is unexplained. Emil Kirdorf, who died in 1937, was always proud of his association with the rise of Naziism. The attempt to limit Hitl er financing to Thyssen and Kirdorf extended into the Nuremburg trials in 1 946, and was chal- lenged only by the Soviet delegate. Even the Soviet delegate was unwill- ing to produce evidence of American associations; t his is not surprising be- cause the Soviet Union depends on the goodwill of t hese same financiers to transfer much needed advanced Western technology to the U.S.S.R. At Nuremburg, statements were made and allowed to g o unchal- lenged which were directly contrary to the known di rect evidence pre- sented above. For example, Buecher, Director Genera l of German General Electric, was absolved from sympathy for Hitler: 240"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"W HO F INANCED A DOLF H ITLER Thyssen has confessed his error like a man and has courage- ously paid a heavy penalty for it. On the other sid e stand men like Reusch of the Gutehoffnungshuette, Karl Bosch, the late chairman of the I.G. Farben Aufsichtsrat, who would very likely have come to a sad end, had he not died in time. Th eir feelings were shared by the deputy chairman of the Aufsichts rat of Kalle. The Siemens and AEG companies which, next to I.G. F arben, were the most powerful German concerns, and they we re deter- mined opponents of national socialism. I know that this unfriendly attitude on the part of the Siemens concern to the Nazis resulted in the firm r eceiving rather rough treatment. The Director General of the AEG (Allgemeine Elektrizitats Gesellschaft), Geheimrat Buecher, whom I knew from my stay in the colonies, was anyth ing but a Nazi. I can assure General Taylor that it is certai nly wrong to assert that the leading industrialists as such favo red Hitler be- fore his seizure of power. 28 Yet on page 56 of this book we reproduce a document originating with General Electric, transferring General Electri c funds to the National Trusteeship account controlled by Rudolf Hess on be half of Hitler and used in the 1933 elections. Similarly, von Schnitzler, who was present at the F ebruary 1933 meeting on behalf of I.G. Farben, denied I.G. Farbe n's contributions to the 1933 Nationale Treuhand: I never heard again of the whole matter [that of fi nancing Hitler], but I believe that either the buro of Goer ing or Schacht or the Reichsverband der Deutschen Industrie had as ked the of- fice of Bosch or Schmitz for payment of IG's share in the elec- tion fund. As I did not take the matter up again I not even at that time knew whether and which amount had been paid by the IG. According to the volume of the IG, I should estimat e IG's share being something like 10 percent of the election fun d, but as far as I know there is no evidence that I.G. Farben par ticipated in the payments. 29 As we have seen, the evidence is incontrovertible r egarding political cash contributions to Hitler at the crucial point o f the takeover of power in Germany — and Hitler's earlier speech to the indus trialists clearly 241"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY revealed that a coercive takeover was the premedita ted intent.

WHO WAS THYSSEN? Fritz Thyssen was the German steel magnate who asso ciated himself with the Nazi movement in the early '20s. When inte rrogated in 1945 under Project Dustbin, Thyssen recalled that he was approached in 1923 by General Ludendorf at the time of French eva cuation of the Ruhr. Shortly after this meeting Thyssen was introd uced to Hitler and provided funds for the Nazis through General Ludend orf. In 1930-31 Emil Kirdorf approached Thyssen and subs equently sent Rudolf Hess to negotiate further funding for the Na zi Party. This time Thyssen arranged a credit of 250,000 marks at the B ank Voor Handel en Scheepvaart N.V. (the Dutch name for the bank na med by Thyssen in the attached document), at 18 Zuidblaak in Rotte rdam, Holland.

In reward for his efforts, Thyssen was showered with political and economic favors by the Third Reich an d enjoyed almost unlimited power and prestige under the Nazi regime until his break with Hitler in 1939 over the decision to invade Poland a nd precipitate the Second World War. This incident and Thyssen's subsequent publication, I Paid Hitler, has a parallel wtih the history of his father, August T hyssen. Through a similar confession in 1918 the elder Thyssen, despi te his record as a staunch backer of pan-Germanism, succeeded in convi ncing the Allies that sole responsibility for German aggression shou ld be placed on the Kaiser and German industrialists should not be blam ed for the support they had given to the Hohenzollerns. Apparently inf luenced by August Thyssen and his associates, the Allies made no effo rt to reform German industry after World War I. The result was that Thy ssen was allowed to retain a vast industrial empire and pass it on inta ct to his heirs and successors. It was against this background that Fritz Thyssen t ook over control of the family holdings following the death of his fath er in 1926. The new German steel baron had already achieved fame throug hout the Reich by his defiance of the French during their occupati on of the Ruhr in 1923. Like Hitler, Thyssen regarded the Treaty of V ersailles as \"a pact of shame\" which must be overthrown if the Fatherlan d were to rise again This is the story in Hitler's Secret Backers. Thyssen set out along the same road as his father, aided by ample Wall Street loans to build German industry. August Thyssen had com- bined with Hugenburg, Kirdorf, and the elder Krupp to promote the All- Deutscher Verband (the Pan-German League), which su pplied the ra- tionale for the Kaiser's expansionist policies. His son became an active member of the Stahlhelm an d later, through Goring, joined the Nazis. Finally, after th e crash of 1931 had brought German industry to the verge of bankruptcy, he openly em- braced national socialism. During the next 2 years Thyssen dedicated his fortu ne and his in- fluence to bring Hitler to power. In 1932 he arrang ed the famous meeting in the Dusseldorf Industrialists' Club, at which Hitler addressed the leading businessmen of the Ruhr and the Rhinela nd. At the close of Hitler's speech Thyssen cried, \"Heil Herr Hitler,\" while the others ap- plauded enthusiastically. By the time of the German Presidential elec- tions later that year, Thyssen obtained contributio ns to Hitler's cam- paign fund from the industrial combines. He alone i s reported to have spent 3,000,000 marks on the Nazis in the year 1932 . 247"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY III. THE UNION BANKING CONNECTION This flow of funds went through Thyssen banks. The Bank fur Handel and Schiff cited as the conduit in the U.S. Intelli gence report was a sub- sidiary of the August Thyssen Bank, and founded in 1918 with H.J. Kouwenhoven and D.C. Schutte as managing partners. In brief, it was Thyssen's personal banking operation, and affiliate d with the W.A. Harriman financial interests in New York. Thyssen r eported to his Project Dustbin interrogators that: \"I chose a Dutch bank because I did not want to be mixed up with German banks in my position, and because I thought it was better to do business with a Dutch bank, and I thought I w ould have the Nazis a little more in my hands.\" Hitler's Secret Backers identifies the conduit from the U.S. as \"von Heydt,\" and von Heydt's Bank was the early name for Thyssen's Bank. Furthermore, the Thyssen front bank in Holland — i. e., the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart N.V. — controlled the Union B anking Cor- poration in New York. The Harrimans had a financial interest in, and E. R oland Harriman (The Order 1917), Averell's brother, was a director of this Union Bank- ing Corporation. The Union Banking Corporation of N ew York City was a joint Thyssen-Harriman operation with the fol lowing directors in 1932: E. Roland Harriman Vice President of W.A. Harriman & (The Order 1917) Co., New York H.J. Kouwenhoven Nazi banker, managing partner of (Nazi) August Thyssen Bank and Bank voor Handel Scheepvaart N.V.

Look at the following: • Four directors of Union Banking are members of The Order: all initiated at Yale in 1917 — members of the same Yal e class. All four were members of the same cell (club) D 115. • E. Harriman was the brother of W. Averell Harriman and a Vice-President of W.A. Harriman Company. • Guaranty Trust was represented by Knight Woolley. • Two of the Union directors, Kouwenhoven and Groning er, were Nazi directors of Bank voor Handel en Scheepva art, formerly the von Heydt Bank. Von Heydt was the inte rmediary between Guaranty Trust and Hitler named in Hitler' s Secret Backer. • Ellery S. James and Prescott S. Bush were partner s in Brown Brothers, later Brown Brothers, Harriman. Out of eight directors of Thyssen's bank in New Yor k, we can therefore identify six who are either Nazis or memb ers of The Order. This private bank was formerly named Von Heydt Bank and von Heydt is named by Sharp in Hitler's Secret Backers as the intermediary from Guaranty Trust in New York to Hitler between 1 930 and 1933. Above all, remember that Shoup was writing in 1933 when this infor- mation was still only known to those on the inside. Out of tens of thousands of banks and bankers, Shoup, in 1933, nam es those that evidence surfacing decades later confirms as financ ing Hitler. In brief, when we merge the information in PROJECT DUSTBIN with Shoup's Hitler's Secret Backers, we find the m ajor overseas conduit for Nazi financing traces back to THE ORDER and specifically cell D 115. IV. PROFIT FROM CONFLICT Out of war and revolution come opportunities for pr ofit. Conflict can be used for profit by corporations und er control and in- fluence of The Order. In World War II, the Korean W ar and the Viet- namese War we can cite examples of American corpora tions that traded with \"the enemy\" for profit. This \"blood trade\" is by no means sporadic or limit ed to a few firms; it is general and reflects higher policy decisions and philosophies. Cor- porations — even large corporations — are dominated by banks and trust companies, and in turn these banks and trust companies are dominated by The Order and its allies.

Even before December 1940 the MS \"Freder ick S. Fales\" owned by Standard Vacuum Company was sunk by a Germ an sub- marine on September 21, 1940. Yet in 1941 Standard Oil of New Jersey (now EXXON) had six Standard Oil tankers und er Panamanian registry, manned by Nazi officers to carry fuel oil from Standard Oil refineries to the Canary Islands, a refueling base of Nazi submarines. A report on this dated July 15, 1941 from Intellige nce at Fifth Corps in Columbus, Ohio is reproduced on page 172. The re port is in error recording that no Standard Oil ships had been sunk by the Nazis; Major Burrows apparently did not know \"Frederick S. Fales \" in 1940. Another example of profit from war is recorded in t he document on page 173. This records the association of RCA and t he Nazis in World War II. RCA was essentially a Morgan-Rockefeller fi rm and so linked to The Order. Yet another example is that of Chase Bank. Chase wa s linked to The Order through the Rockefeller family (Percy Rockefe ller, The Order 1900) and Vice-President Reeve Schley (Yale, Scroll & Key). Directors of Chase in The Order included Frederick Allen (The Order 1900). W.E.S. Griswold (The Order 1899) and Cornelius Vand erbilt, whose brother Gwynne Vanderbilt (The Order 1899) represen ted the family before his death. President of Chase was Winthrop A ldrich. This was the Harvard branch of the Aldrich family, another b ranch is Yale and The Order. Chase Manhattan Bank is not only a firm that plays both sides of the political fence, but with Ford Motor Company, was s elected by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau for post-war investigation of pro-Nazi activities: These two situations [i.e., Ford and Chase Bank] co nvince us that it is imperative to investigate immediately on the spot the activities of subsidiaries of at least some of the larger Amer ican firms which were operating in France during German occupation . . .

The Bush family join ed the Eastern Establishment compara- tively recently, and only as servitors.

But their actions — including his father's role as banker for Adolf Hitler — had tragic effects for the whole planet. It was these services to his family's benefactors, which propelled George Bush to the top. P RESCOTT G OES TO W AR ___________________________________ resident George Herbert Walker Bush was born in 1924 , the son of Prescott S. Bush and Dorothy Walker Bush. We will begin the Geor ge Bush story about a decade before his birth, on the eve of World War I. We will follow the career of his father, Prescott Bush, through his marriage with Dor othy Walker, on the path to fortune, elegance and power. Prescott Bush entered Yale University in 1913. A nat ive of Columbus, Ohio, Prescott had spent the last five years before college in St. George's Episcopal preparatory school in Newport, Rhode Island. Prescott Bush's first college year, 1913, was also t he freshman year at Yale for E. Roland (\"Bunny\" ) Harriman, whose older brother (Wm.) Avere ll Harriman had just graduated from Yale. This is the Averell Harriman who went on to fame as the U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union during World War II, as a gover nor of New York State, and as a presidential advisor who was greatly responsible fo r starting the Vietnam War. 255 W P"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY The Harrimans would become the sponsors of the Bushe s, to lift them onto the stage of world history. In the spring of 1916, Prescott Bush and \"Bunny\" Harr iman were chosen for member- ship in an elite Yale senior-year secret society kn own as Skull and Bones. This unusually morbid, death-celebrating group helped Wall Street financiers find active young men of \"good birth\" to form a kind of imitation British ari stocracy in America. World War I was then raging in Europe. With the pro spect that the U.S.A. would soon join the war, two Skull and Bones \"Patriarchs,\" Averell Harriman (class of 1913) and Percy A. Rockefeller (class of 1900), paid speci al attention to Prescott's class of 1917. They wanted reliable cadres to help them play the G reat Game, in the lucrative new im- perial era that the war was opening up for London a nd New York moneycrats. Prescott Bush, by then a close friend of \"Bunny\" Harriman, and several other Bonesmen from their class of 1917 would later comprise the core p artners in Brown Brothers Harriman, the world's largest private investment bank. World War I did make an immense amount of money for the clan of stock speculators and British bankers who had just taken over U.S. ind ustry. The Harrimans were stars of this new Anglo-American elite. Averells father, stock broker E.H. Harriman, had ga ined control of the Union Pacific Rail- road in 1898 with credit arranged by William Rockefe ller, Percy's father, and by Kuhn Loeb & Co.'s British-affiliated private bankers, Otto Kahn , Jacob Schiff and Felix Warburg. William Rockefeller, treasurer of Standard Oil and b rother of Standard founder John D. Rockefeller, owned National City Bank (later \"Citiba nk\" ) together with Texas-based James Stillman. In return for their backing, E.H. H arriman deposited in City Bank the vast receipts from his railroad lines. When he issu ed tens of millions of dollars of \"wa- tered\" (fraudulent) railroad stock, Harriman sold m ost of the shares through the Kuhn Loeb company. The First World War elevated Prescott Bush and his father, Samuel P. Bush, into the lower ranks of the Eastern Establishment. As war loomed in 1914, National City Bank began reorg anizing the U.S. arms industry. Percy A. Rockefeller took direct control of the Remin gton Arms company, appointing his own man, Samuel F. Pryor, as the new chief exec utive of Remington. The U.S entered World War I in 1917. In the spring of 1918, Prescott's father, Samuel P. Bush, became chief of the Ordnance, Small Arms an d Ammunition Section of the War Industries Board. 2 The senior Bush took national responsibility for go vernment assistance to and relations with Remington and other weapons co mpanies. This was an unusual appointment, as Prescott's fath er seemed to have no background in munitions. Samuel Bush had been president of the Bu ckeye Steel Castings Co. in Columbus, Ohio, maker of railcar parts. His entire career had been in the railroad business — supplying equipment to the Wall Street-owned railroad systems . The War Industries Board was run by Bernard Baruch, a Wall Street speculator with close personal and business ties to old E.H. Harrim an. Baruch's brokerage firm had handled Harriman speculations of all kinds. 3 In 1918, Samuel Bush became director of the Faciliti es Division of the War Indus- tries Board. Prescott's father reported to the Board' s Chairman, Bernard Baruch, and to Baruch's assistant, Wall Street private banker Claren ce Dillon. Robert S. Lovett, President of Union Pacific Railroad , chief counsel to E.H. Harriman and executor of his will, was in charge of national production and purchase \"priorities\" for Baruch's board. 256"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"T HE H OUSE OF B USH : B ORN IN A B ANK With the war mobilization conducted under the super vision of the War Indus- tries Board, U.S. consumers and taxpayers showered u nprecedented fortunes on war producers and certain holders of raw materials and patents. Hearings in 1934 by the committee of U.S. Senator Gerald Nye attacked the \" Merchants of Death\" — war profiteers such as Remington Arms and the British Vic kers company — whose sales- men had manipulated many nations into wars, and the n supplied all sides with the weapons to fight them. Percy Rockefeller and Samuel Pryor's Remington Arms s upplied machine guns and Colt automatic pistols; millions of rifles to Czarist Russia; over half of the small-arms ammunition used by the Anglo-American allies in Wor ld War I; and 69 percent of the rifles used by the United States in that conflict. 4 Samuel Bush's wartime relationship to these business men would continue after the war, and would especially aid his son Prescott's career of service to the Harrimans. Most of the records and correspondence of Samuel Bus h's arms- related section of the government have been burned, \"to save space\" in the National Archives. This matter of destroyed or misplaced records should be of conc ern to citizens of a constitutional republic. Unfortunately, it is a rather constant im pediment with regard to researching George Bush's background: He is certainly the most \" covert\" American chief executive. Now, arms production in wartime is by necessity car ried on with great security precau- tions. The public need not know details of the priv ate lives of the government or industry executives involved, and a broad interrelationship between government and private-sector personnel is normal and useful. But during the period preceding World War I, and in the war years 1914-1917 when the U.S. was still neutral, interlocking Wall Stree t financiers subservient to British strategy lobbied heavily, and twisted U.S. government and do mestic police functions. Led by the J.P. Morgan concern, Britain's overall purchasing ag ent in America, these financiers wanted a world war and they wanted the United States in it as Britain's ally. The U.S. and British arms companies, owned by these international financ iers, poured out weapons abroad in deals not subject to the scrutiny of any elector ate back home. The same gentlemen, as we shall see, later supplied weapons and money t o Hitler's Nazis. That this problem persists today, is in some respec t due to the \"control\" over the documentation and the history of the arms trafficke rs. World War I was a disaster for civilized humanity. It had terrible, unprecedented ca- sualties, and shattering effects on the moral philo sophy of Europeans and Americans. But for a brief period, the war treated Prescott Bus h rather well, In June, 1918, just as his father took over respons ibility for relations of the government with the private arms producers, Prescott went to E urope with the U.S. Army. His unit did not come near any fire until September. But on A ugust 8, 1918, the following item appeared on the front page of Bush's home-town newsp aper: 3 High Military Honors Conferred on Capt. Bush For Notable Gallantry, When Leading Allied Commander s Were Endangered, Local Man is Awarded French, English and U.S. Crosse s.

The incident occurred on the western front about th e time the Germans were launch- ing their great offensive of July 15 ...

Captain Bush is 23 years old, a graduate of Yale in the class of 1917. He was one of Yale's best- known athletes ... was leader of the glee club ... and in his seni or year was elected to the famous Skull and Bones Society ... 5 The day after this astonishing story appeared, ther e was a large cartoon on the editorial page. It depicted Prescott Bush as a small boy, read ing a story-book about military hero- ism, and saying: \"Gee! I wonder if anything like th at could ever truly happen to a boy.\" The caption below was a rehash of the batting- away - the-deadly-shell exploit, writter. in storybook style. 6 Local excitement about the military \"Babe Ruth\" last ed just four weeks. Then this somber little box appeared on the front page: Editor State Journal: A cable received from my son, Prescott S.

Columbus, Sept. 5 . 7 Prescott Bush later claimed that he spent \"about 10 or 11 weeks\" in the area of combat in France. \"We were under fire there... It was quit e exciting, and of course a wonderful experience.\" 8 Prescott Bush was discharged in mid-1919, and return ed for a short time to Columbus, Ohio. But his humiliation in his home town was so i ntense that he could no longer live there. The \"war hero\" story was henceforth not spok en of in his presence. Decades later, when he was an important, rich U.S. Senator, the st ory was whispered and puzzled over among the Congressmen. Looking to be rescued from this ugly situation, Capt ain Bush went to the 1919 reunion of his Yale class in New Haven, Connecticut. Skull a nd Bones Patriarch Wallace Simmons, closely tied to the arms manufacturers, offered Pre scott Bush a job in his St. Louis railroad equipment company. Bush took the offer and moved to St. Louis — and his destiny. 258"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"T HE H OUSE OF B USH -. B ORN IN A B ANK A T HOROUGHBRED M ARRIAGE _____________________________ Prescott Bush went to St. Louis to repair his troubl ed life. Sometime that same year, Averell Harriman made a trip there on a project whi ch would have great consequences for Prescott. The 28- year-old Harriman, until then something of a playboy, wanted to bring his inherited money and contacts into action in the arena of world affairs. President Theodore Roosevelt had denounced Harriman' s father for \"cynicism and deep- seated corruption\" and called him an \"undesirable c itizen.\" 9 For the still- smarting Averell to take his place among the makers and breakers of nations, he needed a financial and intel- ligence-gathering organization of his own. The man Harriman sought to create such an in- stitution for him was Bert Walker, a Missouri stock broker and corporate wheeler-dealer. George Herbert ( \"Bert\") Walker, for whom President George H.W Bush was named, did not immediately accept Harriman's proposal. Wou ld Walker leave his little St. Louis empire, to try his influence in New York and Europe ? Bert was the son of a dry goods wholesaler who had t hrived on imports from Eng- land. 10 The British connection had paid for Walker summer h ouses in Santa Barbara, California, and in Maine — \"Walker's Point\" at Kenne bunkport. Bert Walker had been sent to England for his prep school and college edu cation. By 1919 Bert Walker had strong ties to the Guaranty Trust Company in New York and to the British-American banking house J.P. Morga n and Co. These Wall Street con- cerns represented all the important owners of Ameri can railroads: the Morgan partners and their associates or cousins in the intermarried Rockefeller, Whitney, Harriman and Vanderbilt families. Bert Walker was known as the midwest's premier deal- arranger, awarding the invest- ment capital of his international-banker contacts t o the many railroads, utilities and other midwestern industries of which he and his St. Louis friends were executives or board members. Walker's operations were always quiet, or mysteriou s, whether in local or global affairs. He had long been the \"power behind the throne\" in t he St. Louis Democratic Party, along with his crony, former Missouri Governor David R. Fr ancis. Walker and Francis together had sufficient influence to select the party's cand idates. 11 Back in 1904, Bert Walker, David Francis, Washington University President Rob- ert Brookings and their banker/broker circle had org anized a world's fair in St. Louis, the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. In line with the old Southern Confederacy family backgrounds of many of these sponsors, the fair fea tured a \"Human Zoo\"; live natives from backward jungle regions were exhibited in spec ial cages under the supervision of anthropologist William J. McGee. So Averell Harriman was a natural patron for Bert Wa lker. Bert shared Averell's passion for horse breeding and horse racing, and easily acc ommodated the Harriman family's related social philosophy. They believed that the horses an d racing stables they owned showed the way toward a sharp upgrading of the human stock — j ust select and mate thoroughbreds, and spurn or eliminate inferior animals. The First World War had brought the little St. Loui s oligarchy into the Confederate- slave owner-oriented administration of President Wo odrow Wilson and his advisors, Col. Edward House and Bernard Baruch. Walker's friend Robert Brookings got into Bernard Baruc h's War Industries Board as director of national Price Fixing (sic). David R. Fr ancis became U.S. ambassador to Russia in 1916. As the Bolshevik Revolution broke out, we fi nd Bert Walker busy appointing people to Francis's staff in Petrograd. 12 259"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Walker's earliest activities in relation to the Sov iet state are of significant interest to historians, given the activist role he was to pl ay there together with Harriman. But Walker's life is as covert as the rest of the Bush c lan's, and the surviving public record is extremely thin. The 1919 Versailles peace conference brought togeth er British imperial strategists and their American friends to make postwar global arran gements. For his own intended inter- national adventures, Harriman needed Bert Walker, th e seasoned intriguer, who quietly represented many of the British-designated rulers of American politics and finance. After two persuasion trips west by Harriman, 13 Walker at length agreed to move to New York. But he kept his father's summer house in K ennebunkport, Maine. Bert Walker formally organized the W.A. Harriman & Co . private bank in November 1919. Walker became the bank's president and chief executive; Averell Harriman was chairman and controlling co-owner with his brother Roland (\"Bunny\"), Prescott Bush's close friend from Yale; and Percy Rockefeller was a director and a founding financial sponsor. In the autumn of 1919, Prescott Bush made the acquai ntance of Bert Walker's daughter Dorothy. They were engaged the following year, and were married in August, 1921. 14 Among the ushers and grooms at the elaborate weddin g were Ellery S. James, Knight Woolley and four other fellow Skull and Bonesmen fro m the Yale Class of 1917. 15 The Bush-Walker extended family has gathered each summer at the \"Walker country home\" in Kennebunkport, from this marriage of President Bu sh's parents down to the present day. When Prescott married Dorothy, he was only a minor executive of the Simmons Co., railroad equipment suppliers, while his wife's fath er was building one of the most gigantic businesses in the world. The following year the cou ple tried to move back to Columbus, Ohio; there Prescott worked for a short time in a r ubber products company owned by his father. But they soon moved again to Milton, Mas s., after outsiders bought the little family business and moved it near there. Thus Prescott Bush was going nowhere fast, when his son George Herbert Walker Bush — the future U.S. President — was born in Milto n, Mass., on June 12, 1924. Perhaps it was as a birthday gift for George, that \"Bunny\" Harriman stepped in to rescue his father Prescott from oblivion, bringing him into the Harriman-controlled U.S. Rubber Co. in New York City. In 1925 the young fa mily moved to the town where George was to grow up: Greenwich, Connecticut, a sub urb both of New York and of New Haven/Yale. Then on May 1, 1926, Prescott Bush joined W.A. Harri man & Co. as its vice presi- dent, under the bank's president, Bert Walker, his f ather-in-law and George's maternal grandfather — the head of the family. 16 T HE G REAT G AME ________________________________________ rescott Bush would demonstrate strong loyalty to the firm he joined in 1926. And the bank, with the scope and power of many ordinary nations, could amply reward its agents. George Bush's Grandfather Walker had put the enterprise together, quietly, secretly, using all the international connections a t his disposal. Let us briefly look back at the beginning of the Harriman firm — the Bush fam ily enterprise — and follow its course into one of history's darkest projects. The firm's first global lever was its successful ar rangement to get into Germany by dominating that country's shipping. Averell Harrima n announced in 1920 that he 260 P"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"T HE H OUSE OF B USH -. B ORN IN A B ANK would re-start Germany's Hamburg-Amerika Line, afte r many months of scheming and arm-twisting. Hamburg-Amerika's commercial stea mships had been confiscated by the United States at the end of the First World War. These ships had then become the property of the Harriman enterprise, by some ar rangements with the U.S. au- thorities that were never made public. The deal was breathtaking; it would create the worl d's largest private shipping line. Hamburg-Amerika Line regained its confiscated vesse ls, for a heavy price. The Harri- man enterprise took \"the right to participate in 50 percent of all business originated in Hamburg\"; and for the next twenty years (1920-1940) , the Harriman enterprise had \"complete control of all activities of the Hamburg line in the United States.\" 17 Harriman became co-owner of Hamburg-Amerika. The Ha rriman-Walker firm gained a tight hold on its management, with the not-so-sub tle backing of the post-World War I occupation of Germany by the armies of England an d America. Just after Harriman's public statement, the St. Lou is press celebrated Bert Walkers role in assembling the money to consummate the deal : \"Ex-St. Louisan Forms Giant Ship Merger\" \"G. H. Walker is Moving Power Behind Harriman-Morton Shipping Combine ... .\" The story celebrated a \"merger of two big financial houses in New York, which will place practically unlimited capital at the disposal of the new American-German shipping combine...\"18 Bert Walker had arranged a \"marriage\" of J.P. Morgan credit and Harriman family inherited wealth. W.A. Harriman & Co., of which Walker was president a nd founder, was merging with the Morton & Co. private bank — and Walker was \" [p] rominent in the affairs of Morton & Co.,\" which was interlocked with the Morgan-contro lled Guaranty Trust Co. The Hamburg-Amerika takeover created an effective i nstrument for the manipulation and fatal subversion of Germany. One of the great \" merchants of death,\" Samuel Pryor, was in it from the beginning. Pryor, then chairman of the executive committee of Rem- ington Arms, helped arrange the deal and served wit h Walker on the board of Harrimahs shipping front organization, the American Ship and Commerce Co. Walker and Harriman took the next giant step in 192 2, setting up their European headquarters office in Berlin. With the aid of the H amburg-based Warburg bank, WA. Harriman & Co. began spreading an investment net ove r German industry and raw materials. From the Berlin base, Walker and Harriman then plung ed into deals with the new dictatorship of the Soviet Union. They led a select group of Wall Street and British Empire speculators who re-started the Russian oil in dustry, which had been devastated by the Bolshevik Revolution. They contracted to mine Soviet manganese, an element essential to modern steelmaking. These concessions were arranged directly with Leon Trotsky, then with Feliks Dzerzhinsky, founder of t he Soviet dictatorship's secret infer- ligence service (K.G.B), whose huge statue was final ly pulled down by pro-democracy demonstrators in 1991. These speculations created both channels of communi cation, and the style of accom- modation, with the communist dictatorship, that hav e continued in the family down to President Bush. With the bank launched, Bert Walker found New York t he ideal place to satisfy his passion for sports, games and gambling. Walker was elected president of the U.S. Golf Asociation in 1920. He negotiated new international rules for the game with the Royal 261"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"F IESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, Scotland. Afte r these talks he contributed the three-foot-high silver Walker Cup, for which British and American teams have since competed every two years. Bert's son-in-law Prescott Bush was later secretary o f the U.S. Golf Association dur- ing the grave political and economic crises of the early 1930s. Prescott became USGA President in 1935, while he was otherwise embroiled in the family firm's work with Nazi Germany. When George was one year old, in 1925, Bert Walker a nd Averell Harriman headed a syndicate which rebuilt Madison Square Garden as th e modern Palace of Sport. Walker was at the center of New York's gambling scene in i ts heyday, in that Prohibition era of colorful and bloody gangsters. The Garden bloomed w ith million-dollar prize fights; bookies and their clients pooled more millions, try ing to match the pace of the specula- tion-crazed stock and bond men. This was the era of \"organized\" crime — the national gambling and bootleg syndicate structured on the Ne w York corporate model. By 1930, when George was a boy of six, Grandpa Walk er was New York State Racing Commissioner. The vivid colors and sounds of the rac ing scene must have impressed little George as much as his grandfather. Bert Walke r bred race horses at his own stable, the Log Cabin Stud. He was president of the Belmont P ark race track. Bert also person- ally managed most aspects of Averell's racing inter ests— down to picking the colors and fabrics for the Harriman racing gear. 19 From 1926, George's father Prescott Bush showed a fi erce loyalty to the Harrimans and a dogged determination to advance himself; he g radually came to run the day-to- day operations of WA. Harriman & Co. After the firm' s 1931 merger with the British- American banking house Brown Brothers, Prescott Bush b ecame managing partner of the resulting company: Brown Brothers Harriman. This was ultimately the largest and politically the most important private banking hous e in America. Financial collapse, world depression and social uph eaval followed the fevered specula- tion of the 1920s. The 1929-31 crash of securities values wiped out the small fortune Prescott Bush had gained since 1926. But because of h is devotion to the Harrimans, they \"did a very generous thing,\" as Bush later put it. T hey staked him to what he had lost and put him back on his feet. Prescott Bush described his own role, from 1931 thr ough the 1940s, in a confidential interview: I emphasize ... that the Harrimans showed great cou rage and loyalty and confidence in us, because three or four of us were really running the business, the day to day business. Averell was all over the place in those days ... and Roland was involved in a lot of directorships, and he didn't get down into the \"lift- up-and-bear- down\" activity of the bank, you see - the day- to-day decisions ... we were really running th e business, the day to day business, all the administrative decisions and the executive decision s. We were the ones that did it. We were the managing partners, let's say. 20 But of the \"three or four\" partners in charge, Presc ott was effectively at the head of the firm, because he had taken over management of the g igantic personal investment funds of Averell and E. Roland \"Bunny\" Harriman. In those interwar years, Prescott Bush made the fami ly fortune which George Bush inherited. He piled up the money from an internatio nal project which continued until a new world war, and the action of the U.S. governmen t, intervened to stop him. 262"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"T HE H OUSE OF B USH -.

On Oct. 28, the government issued orders seizing two Nazi f ront organizations run by the Bush-Harriman bank: the Holland-American Tradin g Corporation and the Seamless Steel Equipment Corporation. 2 U.S. forces landed under fire near Algiers on Nov. 8,1942; heavy combat raged throughout November. Nazi interests in the Silesian -American Corporation, long managed by Prescott Bush and his father-in-law Geor ge Herbert Walker, were seized under the Trading with the Enemy Act on Nov. 17, 1942. In this action, the government announced that it was seizing only t he Nazi interests, leaving the Nazis' U.S. partners to carry on the business. 3 These and other actions taken by the U.S. governmen t in wartime were, tragically, too little and too late. President Bush 's family had already played a central role in financing and arming Adolf Hitler f or his takeover of Germany, in financing and managing the buildup of Nazi war i ndustries for the conquest of Europe and war against the U.S.A.; and in the de velopment of Nazi genocide theories and racial propaganda, with their well-kno wn results. The facts presented here must be known, and their i mplications reflected upon, for a proper understanding of President George Herb ert Walker Bush and of the danger to mankind that he represents. The President 's family fortune was largely a result of the Hitler project. The powerful Anglo- American family associations, which later boosted him into the Central Intelligen ce Agency and up to the White House, were his father's partners in the Hitler pro ject. President Franklin Roosevelt's Alien Property Custo dian, Leo T. Crow- ley, signed Vesting Order Number 248 seizing the pr operty of Prescott Bush under the Trading with the Enemy Act. The orde r, published in obscure government record books and kept out of the news, 4 explained nothing about the Nazis involved; only that the Uni on Banking Corpo- ration was run for the \"Thyssen family\" of \"Germany and/or Hungary\" — \"nationals ... of a designated enemy country.\" 266"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"T HE H ITLER P ROJECT By deciding that Prescott Bush and the other direct ors of the Union Banking Corp. were legally front men for the Nazis, the gove rnment avoided the more important historical issue: In what way were Hitler 's Nazis themselves hired, armed and instructed by the New York and London clique of which Prescott Bush was an executive manager? Let us examine the Harriman-Bush Hitler project from the 1920s until it was partially broken up, to seek an answer for that question. O RIGIN AND E XTENT OF THE P ROTECT __________________________ Fritz Thyssen and his business partners are univers ally recognized as the most impor- tant German financiers of Adolf Hitler's takeover o f Germany. At the time of the order seizing the Thyssen family's Union Banking Corp ., Mr. Fritz Thyssen had already published his famous book, I Paid Hitler, 5 admitting that he had financed Adolf Hitler and the Nazi movement since October 1923. Thyssen's role as the leading early backer of Hitler's grab for power in Germany had been note d by U.S. diplomats in Berlin in 1932. 6 The order seizing the Bush-Thyssen bank was curious ly quiet and modest about the identity of the perpetrators who had been naile d. But two weeks before the official order, government investigators had reported secretly that \"W. Averell Harriman was in Europe sometime pr ior to 1924 and at that time became acquainted with Fritz Thyssen, the German industria list.\" Harriman and Thyssen agreed to set up a bank for Thyssen in New York. \"[C]ertain of [Harriman's] associates would serve as directors ....\" Thyssen agent \"H. J. Kouwe nhoven ... came to the United States - prior to 1924 for conferences with the Harriman Co mpany in this connection ...\" 7 When exactly was \"Harriman in Europe sometime prior to 1924[?]\" In fact, he was in Berlin in 1922 to set up the Berlin branch of W.A. Harriman & Co. under George Walker's presidency. The Union Banking Corporation was established formall y in 1924, as a unit in the Manhattan offices of W.A. Harriman & Co., interlocki ng with the Thyssen-owned Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart (BHS) in the Netherlands. The investigators concluded that \"the Union Banking Corporation has since its inceptio n handled funds chiefly supplied to it through the Dutch bank by the Thyssen interes ts for American investment.\" Thus by personal agreement between Averell Harriman and Fritz Thyssen in 1922, W.A. Harriman & Co. (alias Union Banking Corporation) would be transferring funds back and forth between New York and the \"Thyssen in terests \" in Germany. By putting up about $400,000, the Harriman organization would be joint owner and manager of Thyssen's banking operations outside of Germany. How important was the Nazi enterprise for which Pre sident Bush's father was the New York banker? A 1942 U.S. government investigative report said th at Bush's Nazi-front bank was an interlocking concern with the Vereinigte Stahlwerke (United Steel Works Corporation or German Steel Trust) led by Fritz Thyssen and his two brorhers. After the war, Con- gressional investigators probed the Thyssen interes ts, Union Banking Corp. and related Nazi units. The investigation showed that the Verei nigte Stahlwerke had produced the following approximate proportions of total German n ational output: 50.8% of Nazi Germany's pig iron 41.4% of Nazi Germany's universal plate 36.0% of Nazi Germany's heavy plate 38.5% of Nazi Germany's galvanized sheet 267"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY 45.5% of Nazi Germany's pipes and tubes 22.1% of Nazi Germany's wire 35.0% of Nazi Germany's explosives. 8 Prescott Bush became vice president of W.A. Harrima n & Co. in 1926. That same year, a friend of Harriman and Bush set up a giant new organization for their client Fritz Thyssen, prime sponsor of politician Adolf Hi tler. The new German Steel Trust, Germany's largest industrial corporation, was organ ized in 1926 by Wall Street banker Clarence Dillon. Dillon was the old comrade of Presc ott Bush's father Sam Bush from the \"Merchants of Death\" bureau in World War I. In return for putting up $70 million to create his organization, majority owner Thys- sen gave the Dillon Read company two or more represe ntatives on the board of the new Steel Trust. 9 Thus there is a division of labor: Thyssen's own co nfidential accounts, for political and related purposes, were run through the Walker-Bu sh organization; the German Steel Trust did its corporate banking through Dillon Read. The Walker-Bush firm's banking activities were not j ust politically neutral money-mak- ing ventures which happened to coincide with the ai ms of German Nazis. All of the firms European business in those days was organized aroun d anti-democratic political forces. In 1927, criticism of their support for totalitaria nism drew this retort from Bert Walker, written from Kennebunkport to Averell Harriman: \"It seems to me that the suggestion in connection with Lord Bearsted's views that we withdr aw from Russia smacks somewhat of the impertinent.... I think that we have drawn o ur line and should hew to it.\" 10 Averell Harriman met with Italy's fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini. A representative of the firm subsequently telegraphed good news back to his chief executive Bert Walker: \"... During these last days ... Mussolini ... has e xamined and approved our c[o]ntract 15 June.\" 11 The great financial collapse of 1929-31 shook Ameri ca, Germany and Britain, weaken- ing all governments. It also made the hard-pressed Prescott Bush even more willing to do whatever was necessary to retain his new place in t he world. It was in this crisis that certain Anglo-Americans determined on the installation of a Hitler regime in Germany. W.A. Harriman & Co., well-positioned for this enterp rise and rich in assets from their German and Russian business, merged with the British- American investment house, Brown Brothers, on January 1, 1931. Bert Walker retire d to his own G.H. Walker & Co. This left the Harriman brothers, Prescott Bush an d Thatcher M. Brown as the senior partners of the new Brown Brothers Harriman firm. (Th e London, England branch of the Brown family firm continued operating under its hist oric name — Brown, Shipley.) Robert A. Lovett also came over as a partner from Bro wn Brothers. His father, E.H. Harriman's lawyer and railroad chief, had been on t he War Industries Board with Prescott's father. Though he remained a partner in Brown Brother s Harriman, the junior Lovett soon replaced his father as chief executive of Unio n Pacific Railroad. Brown Brothers had a racial tradition that fitted it well for the Hitler project! American patriots had cursed its name back in U.S. Civil War days. Brown Brothers, with offices in the U.S.A. and in England, had carried on their shi ps fully 75 percent of the slave cotton from the American South over to British mill owners. Now in 1931, the virtual dictator of world finance, Bank of England Governor Montagu Colle t Norman, was a former Brown Brothers partner, whose grandfather had been boss of Brown Brothers during the U.S. Civil War. Montagu Norman was known as the most avid of H itler's supporters within British 268"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"T HE H ITLER P ROJECT ruling circles, and Norman's intimacy with this fir m was essential to his management of the Hitler project. In 1931, while Prescott Bush ran the New York offic e of Brown Brothers Harriman, Prescott's partner was Montagu Norman's intimate fr iend Thatcher Brown. The Bank of England chief always stayed at the home of Presc ott's partner on his hush-hush trips to New York. Prescott Bush concentrated on the firm 's German activities, and Thatcher Brown saw to their business in old England, under th e guidance of his mentor Montagu Norman. 12 H ITLER ' S L ADDER TO P OWER ________________________________ Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany January 30 , 1933, and absolute dictator in March 1933, after two years of expensive and vio lent lobbying and electioneer- ing. Two affiliates of the Bush-Harriman organizatio n played great parts in this criminal undertaking: Thyssen's German Steel Trust and the H amburg-Amerika Line and several of its executives. 13 Let us look more closely at the Bush family's German partners. Fritz Thyssen told Allied interrogators after the w ar about some of his financial sup- port for the Nazi Party: \"In 1930 or 1931 ... I tol d [Hitler's deputy Rudolph] Hess ... I would arrange a credit for him with a Dutch bank in Rotterdam, the Bank fur Handel and Schiff [i.e. Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart (BHS ), the Harriman-Bush affiliate], I arranged the credit ... he would pay it back in t hree years .... I chose a Dutch bank because I did not want to be mixed up with German b anks in my position, and because I thought it was better to do business with a Dutch bank, and I thought I would have the Nazis a little more in my hands .... \"The credit was about 250-300,000 [gold] marks — ab out the sum I had given before. The loan has been repaid in part to the Dut ch bank, but I think some money is still owing on it ....\" 14 The overall total of Thyssen's political donations and loans to the Nazis was well over a million dollars, including funds he raised from o thers — in a period of terrible money shortage in Germany. Friedrich Flick was the major co-owner of the Germa n Steel Trust with Fritz Thyssen, Thyssen's long-time collaborator and occasional com petitor. In preparation for the war crimes tribunal at Nuremberg, the U.S. government s aid that Flick was \"one of leading financiers and industrialists who from 1932 contrib uted large sums to the Nazi Party ... member of 'Circle of Friends' of Himmler who contrib uted large sums to the SS.\" 15 Flick, like Thyssen, financed the Nazis to maintain their private armies called Schutz- staffel (S.S. or Black Shirts) and Sturmabteilung(S. A., storm troops or Brown Shirts). The Flick-Harriman partnership was directly supervi sed by Prescott Bush, President Bush's father, and by George Walker, President Bush's grandfather. The Harriman-Walker Union Banking Corp. arrangements for the German Steel Trust had made them bankers for Flick and his vast operations in Germany by no later than 1926. The Harriman Fifteen Corporation (George Walker, pre sident, Prescott Bush and Averrell Harriman, sole directors) held a substanti al stake in the Silesian Holding Co. at the time of the merger with Brown Brothers, Jan. 1, 1931. This holding correlated to Averell Harriman's chairmanship of the Consolidated Silesian Steel Corporation, the American group owning one-third of a complex of steel-making , coal-mining and zinc-mining activities in Germany and Poland, in which Friedric h Flick owned two-thirds. 16 269"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY The Nuremberg prosecutor characterized Flick as fol lows: \"Proprietor and head of a large group of industrial enterprises (coal and iron mines, steel producing and fabricating plants)...'Wehrwirtschaft sfuhrer', 1938 [title awarded to promi- nent industrialists for merit in armaments drive —' Military Economy Leader'] ... 17 For this buildup of the Hitler war machine with coa l, steel and arms production, using slave laborers, the Nazi Flick was condemned to sev en years in prison at the Nuremberg trials; he served three years. With friends in New York and London, however, Flick lived into the 1970s and died a billionaire. On March 19, 1934, Prescott Bush — then director of the German Steel Trust's Union Banking Corporation — initiated an alert to the absent Averell Harriman about a problem which had developed in the Flick partners hip. 18 Bush sent Harriman a clip- ping from the New York Times of that day, which rep orted that the Polish government was fighting back against American and German stock holders who controlled \"Poland's largest industrial unit, the Upper Silesian Coal and Steel Company ...\" The Times article continued: \"The company has long been accused of mismanage- ment, excessive borrowing, fictitious bookkeeping a nd gambling in securities. Warrants were issued in December for several directors accus ed of tax evasions. They were German citizens and they fled. They were replaced by Poles . Herr Flick, regarding this as an at- tempt to make the company's board entirely Polish, retaliated by restricting credits until the new Polish directors were unable to pay the wor kmen regularly.\" The Times noted that the company's mines and mills \"employ 25,000 men and ac- count for 45 percent of Poland's total steel output and 12 percent of her coal production. Two-thirds of the company's stock is owned by Fried rich Flick, a leading German steel industrialist, and the remainder is owned by intere sts in the United States.\" In view of the fact that a great deal of Polish out put was being exported to Hitler Germany under depression conditions, the Polish gov ernment thought that Prescott Bush, Harriman and their Nazi partners should at lea st pay full taxes on their Polish holdings. The U.S. and Nazi owners responded with a lockout. The letter to Harriman in Washington reported a cable from their European representative: \"Have undertaken new steps London Berlin ... please establish friendl y relations with Polish Ambassador [in Washington].\" A 1935 Harriman Fifteen Corporation memo from George Walker announced an agreement had been made \"in Berlin\" to sell an 8,000 block of their shares in Consoli- dated Silesian Steel. 19 But the dispute with Poland did not deter the Bush f amily from continuing its partnership with Flick. Nazi tanks and bombs \"settled\" this dispute in Sept ember, 1939 with the invasion of Poland, beginning World War II. The Nazi army ha d been equipped by Flick, Har- riman, Walker and Bush, with materials essentially s tolen from Poland. There were probably few people at the time who coul d appreciate the irony that when the Soviets also attacked and invaded Poland from t he East, their vehicles were fueled by oil pumped from Baku wells revived by the Harriman/W alker/Bush enterprise. Three years later, nearly a year after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government ordered the seizure of the Nazis' share in the Silesian-American Corporation under the Trading with the Enemy Act. Enemy nationa ls were said to own 49 percent of the common stock and 41.67 percent of the preferred stock of the company. The order characterized the company as a \"business enterprise within the United States, owned by [a front company in] Zurich, Switz erland, and held for the benefit of Bergwerksgesellschaft George von Giesche's Erben, a German corporation ....\" 20 270"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"T HE H ITLER P ROJECT Bert Walker was still the senior director of the com pany, which he had founded back in 1926 simultaneously with the creation of th e German Steel Trust. Ray Morris, Prescott's partner from Union Banking Corp. and Brown Brothers Harriman, was also a director. The investigative report prior to the government cr ackdown explained the \"NATURE OF BUSINESS: The subject corporation is an American holding company for German and Polish subsidiaries, which own large and valuab le coal and zinc mines in Silesia, Po- land and Germany. Since September 1939, these prope rties have been in the possession of and have been operated by the German government and have undoubtedly been of considerable assistance to that country in its war effort.\" 21 The report noted that the American stockholders hop ed to regain control of the European properties after the war. C ONTROL OF N AZI C OMMERCE ___________________________ Bert Walker had arranged the credits Harriman needed to take control of the Ham- burg-Amerika Line back in 1920. Walker had organize d the American Ship and Commerce Corp. as a unit of the W.A Harriman & Co., wi th contractual power over Hamburg-Amerika's affairs. As the Hitler project went into high gear, Harriman -Bush shares in American Ship and Commerce Corp. were held by the Harriman Fifteen Corp., run by Prescott Bush and Bert Walker. 22 It was a convenient stroll for the well-tanned, ath letic, handsome Prescott Bush. From the Brown Brothers Harriman skyscraper at 59 Wall Str eet — where he was senior man- aging partner, confidential investments manager and adviser to Averell and his brother \"Bunny\" — he walked across to the Harriman Fifteen Co rporation at One Wall Street, otherwise known as G.H. Walker & Co. — and around th e corner to his subsidiary offices at 39 Broadway, former home of the old W.A. Harriman & Co., and still the offices for American Ship and Commerce Corp., and of the Union Banking Corporation. In many ways, Bush's Hamburg-Amerika Line was the pi vot for the entire Hitler project. Averell Harriman and Bert Walker had gained control over the steamship company in 1920 in negotiations with its post-World War I c hief executive, Wilhelm Cuno, and with the line's bankers, M.M. Warburg. Cuno was the reafter completely dependent on the Anglo-Americans, and became a member of the Ang lo-German Friendship Society. In the 1930-32 drive for a Hitler dictatorship, Wil helm Cuno contributed important sums to the Nazi Party. 23 Albert Voegler was chief executive of the Thyssen-F lick German Steel Trust for which Bush's Union Banking Corp. was the New York office. He was a director of the Bush-af- filiate BHS Bank in Rotterdam, and a director of the H arriman-Bush Hamburg-Amerika Line. Voegler joined Thyssen and Flick in their hea vy 1930-33 Nazi contributions, and helped organize the final Nazi leap into national p ower. 24 The Schroeder family of bankers was a linchpin for the Nazi activities of Harriman and Prescott Bush, closely tied to their lawyers All en and John Foster Dulles. Baron Kurt von Schroeder was co-director of the mass ive Thyssen-Hutte foundry along with Johann Groeninger, Prescott Bush's New York ban k partner. Kurt von Schroeder was treasurer of the support organization for the Nazi Party's private armies, to which Friedrich Flick contributed. Kurt von Schroeder and Montagu N orman's protege Hjalmar Schacht together made the final arrangements for Hitler to enter the government. 25 271"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUI S ECRET S OCIETY Baron Rudolph von Schroeder was vice president and di rector of the Hamburg- Amerika Line. Long an intimate contact of Averell H arriman's in Germany, Baron Rudolph sent his grandson Baron Johann Rudolph for a tour of Prescott Bush's Brown Brothers Harriman offices in New York City in Decembe r 1932 — on the eve of their Hitler — triumph. 26 Certain actions taken directly by the Harriman-Bush s hipping line in 1932 must be ranked among the gravest acts of treason in this ce ntury. The U.S. embassy in Berlin reported back to Washingt on that the \"costly election campaigns\" and \"the cost of maintaining a private a rmy of 300,000 to 400,000 men\" had raised questions as to the Nazis' financial bac kers. The constitutional government of the German republic moved to defend national fre edom by ordering the Nazi Party private armies disbanded. The U.S. embassy reported that the Hamburg-Amerika Line was purchasing and distributing propaganda attacks against the German government, for attempting this last-minute crackdown on Hitler 's forces. 27 Thousands of German opponents of Hitlerism were sho t or intimidated by privately armed Nazi Brown Shirts. In this connection we note that the original \"Merchant of Death,\" Samuel Pryor, was a founding director of bo th the Union Banking Corp. and the American Ship and Commerce Corp. Since Mr. Pryor was executive committee chair- man of Remington Arms and a central figure in the wo rld's private arms traffic, his use to the Hitler project was enhanced as the Bush famil y's partner in Nazi Party banking and trans-Atlantic shipping. The U.S. Senate arms-traffic investigators probed Re mington after it was joined in a cartel agreement on explosives to the Nazi firm I .G. Farben. Looking at the period leading up to Hitler's seizure of power, the Senato rs found that \"German political asso- ciations, like the Nazi and others, are nearly all armed with American ... guns... . Arms of all kinds coming from America are transshipped i n the Scheldt to river barges before the vessels arrive in Antwerp. They then can be car ried through Holland without police inspection or interference. The Hitlerists and Commu nists are presumed to get arms in this manner. The principal arms coming from America are Thompson submachine guns and revolvers. The number is great.\" 28 The beginning of the Hitler regime brought some biz arre changes to the Hamburg- Amerika Line — and more betrayals. Prescott Bush's American Ship and Commerce Corp. noti fied Max Warburg of Ham- burg, Germany, on March 7, 1933, that Warburg was t o be the corporation's official, designated representative on the board of Hamburg-A merika. 29 Max Warburg replied on March 27, 1933, assuring his American sponsors that the Hitler government was good for Germany: \"For the la st few years business was considerably better than we had anticipated, but a reaction is m aking itself felt for some months. We are actually suffering also under the very active propa ganda against Germany, caused by some unpleasant circumstances. These occurrences were th e natural consequence of the very excited election campaign, but were extraordinarily exaggerated in the foreign press. The Government is firmly resolved to maintain public pe ace and order in Germany, and I feel perfectly convinced in this respect that there is n o cause for any alarm whatsoever.\" 30 This seal of approval for Hitler, coming from a fam ous Jew, was just what Harriman and Bush required, for they anticipated rather seri ous \"alarm\" inside the U.S.A. against their Nazi operations. On March 29, 1933, two days after Max's letter to H arriman, Max's son, Erich Warburg, sent a cable to his cousin Frederick M. Wa rburg, a director of the Harriman 272"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"T HE H ITLER P ROJECT railroad system. He asked Frederick to \"use all you r influence\" to stop all anti-Nazi activity in America, including \"atrocity news and unfriendly propaganda in foreign press, mass meetings, etc.\" Frederick cabled back to Erich: \"No responsible groups here [are] urging [a] boycott [of] German goods[,] merely excited ind ividuals.\" Two days after that, On March 31, 1933, the American-Jewish Committee, contr olled by the Warburgs, and the B'nai B'rith, heavily influenced by the Sulzbergers ( New York Times), issued a formal, official joint statement of the two organizations, counseling \"that no American boycott against Germany be encouraged,\" and advising \"that no further mass meetings be held or similar forms of agitation be employed.\" 31 The American Jewish Committee and the B'nai B'rith (m other of the \"Anti-Defama- tion League\" ) continued with this hardline, no-att ack-on-Hitler stance all through the 1930s, blunting the fight mounted by many Jews and other anti-fascists. Thus the decisive interchange reproduced above, tak ing place entirely within the orbit of the Harriman/Bush firm, may explain somethi ng of the relationship of George Bush to American Jewish and Zionist leaders. Some of them, in close cooperation with his family, played an ugly part in the drama of Naz iism. Is this why \"professional Nazi- hunters\" have never discovered how the Bush family m ade its money? The executive board of the Hamburg Amerika Line (Ha pag) met jointly with the North German Lloyd Company board in Hamburg on S ept. 5, 1933. Under official Nazi supervision, the two firms were merge d. Prescott Bush's American Ship and Commerce Corp. installed Christian J. Beck, a long- time Harriman executive, as manager of freight and operations in North Ameri ca for the new joint Nazi ship- ping lines (Hapag-Lloyd) on Nov. 4, 1933. According to testimony of officials of the companie s before Congress in 1934, a supervisor from the Nazi Labor Front rode with ever y ship of the Harriman-Bush line; employees of the New York offices were directly org anized into the Nazi Labor Front organization; Hamburg-Amerika provided free passage to individuals going abroad for Nazi propaganda purposes; and the line subsidized p ro-Nazi newspapers in the U.S.A., as it had done in Germany against the constitutiona l German government. 32 In mid-1936, Prescott Bush's American Ship and Comm erce Corp. cabled M.M. Warburg, asking Warburg to represent the company's heavy share interest at the forth- coming Hamburg-Amerika stockholders meeting. The Wa rburg office replied with the information that \"we represented you\" at the stockh olders meeting and \"exercised on your behalf your voting power for Rm [gold marks] 3, 509,600 Hapag stock deposited with us.\" The Warburgs transmitted a letter received from Emi l Helfferich, German chief execu- tive of both Hapag-Lloyd and of the Standard Oil su bsidiary in Nazi Germany: \"It is the intention to continue the relations with Mr. Harrim an on the same basis as heretofore.... In a colorful gesture, Hapag's Nazi chairman Helffe rich sent the line's president across the Atlantic on a Zeppelin to confer with their New York string-pullers. After the meeting with the Zeppelin passenger, the Harriman-Bush office replied: \"I am glad to learn that Mr. Hellferich [sic] has stat ed that relations between the Hamburg American Line and ourselves will be continued on th e same basis as heretofore.\" 33 Two months before moving against Prescott Bush's Uni on Banking Corporation, the U.S. government ordered the seizure of all property of the Hamburg-Amerika Line and North German Lloyd, under the Trading with the Enem y Act. The investigators noted in the pre-seizure report that Christian J. Beck was still acting as an attorney represent- ing the Nazi firm. 34 273"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY In May 1933, just after the Hitler regime was conso lidated, an agreement was reached in Berlin for the coordination of all Nazi commerce with the U.S.A. The Harriman International Co., led by Averell Harriman's first c ousin Oliver, was to head a syndicate of 150 firms and individuals, to conduct all export s from Hitler Germany to the Unites States. 35 This pact had been negotiated in Berlin between Hitl er's economics minister, Hjalmar Schacht, and John Foster Dulles, international atto rney for dozens of Nazi enterprises, with the counsel of Max Warburg and Kurt von Schroe der. John Foster Dulles would later be U.S. Secretary of State, and the great power in the Republican Party of the 1950s. Foster's friendship a nd that of his brother Allen (head of the Central Intelligence Agency), greatly aided Pres cott Bush to become the Republican U.S. Senator from Connecticut. And it was to be of i nestimable value to George Bush, in his ascent to the heights of \"covert action gove rnment,\" that both of these Dulles brothers were the lawyers for the Bush family's far- flung enterprise. Throughout the 1930s, John Foster Dulles arranged d ebt restructuring for German firms under a series of decrees issued by Adolf Hit ler. In these deals, Dulles struck a bal- ance between the interest owed to selected, larger investors, and the needs of the growing Nazi war-making apparatus for producing tanks, pois on gas, etc. Dulles wrote to Prescott Bush in 1937 concerning one such arrangement. The Ger- man-Atlantic Cable Company, owning Nazi Germany's onl y telegraph channel to the United States, had made debt and management agreeme nts with the Walker-Harriman bank during the 1920s. A new decree would now void those agreements, which had origi- nally been reached with non-Nazi corporate official s. Dulles asked Bush, who managed these affairs for Averell Harriman, to get Averell' s signature on a letter to Nazi officials, agreeing to the changes. Dulles wrote: Sept. 22, 1937 Mr. Prescott S. Bush 59 Wall Street, New York, N.Y. Dear Press, I have looked over the letter of the German-America n [sic] Cable Company to Averell Harriman .... It would appear that the only rights in the matter are those which inure in the bankers and that no legal embarrassment would resul t, so far as the bondholders are concerned, by your acquiescence in the modification of the ban kers' agreement. Sincerely yours, John Foster Dulles Dulles enclosed a proposed draft reply, Bush got Har riman's signature, and the changes went through. 36 In conjunction with these arrangements, the German Atlantic Cable Company at- tempted to stop payment on its debts to smaller Ame rican bondholders. The money was to be used instead for arming the Nazi state, under a decree of the Hitler government. Despite the busy efforts of Bush and Dulles, a New York court decided that this particular Hitler \"law\" was invalid in the United S tates; small bondholders, not parties to deals between the bankers and the Nazis, were en titled to get paid. 37 274"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"T HE H ITLER P ROJECT In this and a few other of the attempted swindles, the intended victims came out with their money. But the Nazi financial and politic al reorganization went ahead to its tragic climax. For his part in the Hitler revolution, Prescott Bush was paid a fortune. This is the legacy he left to his son, President Ge orge Bush. A N I MPORTANT H ISTORICAL N OTE : HOW THE HARRIMANS HIRED HITLER ________________________ ___________ IT WAS NOT INEVITABLE that millions would be slaugh tered under fascism and in World War II. At certain moments of crisis, crucial pro-N azi decisions were made outside of Germany. These decisions for pro-Nazi actions we re more aggressive than the mere \"appeasement\" which Anglo-American historians later preferred to discuss. Private armies of 300,000 to 400,000 terrorists aid ed the Nazis' rise to power. W.A. Harriman's Hamburg-Amerika Line intervened against Germany's 1932 attempt to break them up. The 1929-31 economic collapse bankrupted the Wall-S treet-backed German Steel Trust. When the German government took over the Tru st's stock shares, interests as- sociated with Konrad Adenauer and the anti-Nazi Cath olic Center Party attempted to acquire the shares. But the Anglo-Americans — Mon tagu Norman, and the Harri- man-Bush bank — made sure that their Nazi puppet Fri tz Thyssen regained control over the shares and the Trust. Thyssen's bankrollin g of Hitler could then continue unhindered. Unpayable debts crushed Germany in the 1920s, repar ations required by the Versailles agreements. Germany was looted by the London-New Yo rk banking system, and Hitler's propaganda exploited this German debt burden. But immediately after Germany came under Hitler's di ctatorship, the Anglo-American financiers granted debt relief, which freed funds t o be used for arming the Nazi state. The North German Lloyd steamship line, which was me rged with Hamburg-Amerika Line, was one of the companies which stopped debt p ayments under a Hitler decree ar- ranged by John Foster Dulles and Hjalmar Schacht. Kuhn Loeb and Co.'s Felix Warburg carried out the Hi tler finance plan in New York. Kuhn Loeb asked North German Lloyd bondholders to a ccept new lower interest steam- ship bonds, issued by Kuhn Loeb, in place of the be tter pre-Hitler bonds. New York attorney Jacob Chaitkin, father of coauthor Anton Chaitkin, took the cases of many different bondholders who rejected the swin dle by Harriman, Bush, Warburg, and Hitler. Representing a women who was owed $30 on an old steamship bond — and opposing John Foster Dulles in New York municipal c ourt — Chaitkin threatened a writ from the sheriff, tying up the 30,000 ton tran satlantic liner Europa until the client received her $30. {New York Times, January 10, 1934 , p. 31 col. 3). The American Jewish Congress hired Jacob Chaitkin as the legal director of the boy- cott against Nazi Germany. The American Federation of Labor cooperated with Jewish and other groups in the anti-import boycott. On the other side, virtually all the Nazi trade with the United States was under the supervis ion of the Harriman interests and functionaries such as Prescott Bush, father of Presi dent George Bush. Meanwhile, the Warburgs demanded that American Jews not \"agitate\" against the Hitler government, or join the organized boycott. T he Warburgs' decision was carried out by the American Jewish Committee and the B'nai B'r ith, who opposed the boycott as the Nazi military state grew increasingly powerf ul. 275"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY The historical cover-up on these events is so tight that virtually the only expose of the Warburgs came in journalist John L. Spivak's \"W all Street's Fascist Conspiracy,\" in the pro-communist New Masses periodical (Jan. 29 an d Feb. 5, 1934). Spivak pointed out that the Warburgs controlled the American Jewis h Committee, which opposed the anti-Nazi boycott, while their Kuhn Loeb and Co. ha d underwritten Nazi shipping and he exposed the financing of pro-fascist politic al activities by the Warburgs and their partners and allies, many of whom were bigwigs in t he American Jewish Committee and B'nai B'rith. Given where the Spivak piece appeared, it is not su rprising that Spivak called Warburg an ally of the Morgan Bank, but made no mention of A verell Harriman. Mr. Harriman, after all, was a permanent hero of the Soviet Union . John L. Spivak later underwent a curious transforma tion, himself joining the cover- up. In 1 967, he wrote an autobiography (A Man in H is Time, New York: Horizon Press), which praises the American Jewish Committee. The pro -fascism of the Warburgs does not appear in the book. The former \"rebel \" Spivak also praises the action arm of the B'nai B'rith, the Anti-Defamation League. Pathetically, he comments favorably that the League has spy files on the American populace which it sha res with government agencies. Thus is history erased; and those decisions, which direct history into one course or another, are lost to the knowledge of the current g eneration.

On ly the source of his immense wealth is known, not its employment. 3 Will Farish has long been Bush's closest friend and confidante. He is also the unique private host to Britain's Queen Elizabeth II: Farish owns an d boards the studs which mate with the Queen's mares. That is her public rationale whe n she comes to America and stays in Farish's house. It is a vital link in the mind of o ur Anglophile President. President Bush can count on Will Farish not to betra y the violent secrets surrounding the Bush family money. For Farish's own family fortu ne was made in the same Hitler project, in a nightmarish partnership with George Bu sh's father. On March 25, 1942, U.S. Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold announced that William Stamps Farish (grandfather of the Pres ident's money manager) had pled \"no contest\" to charges of criminal conspiracy with the Nazis. Farish was the principal manager of a worldwide cartel between Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey and the I.G. Farben concern. The merged enterprise had opened th e Auschwitz slave labor camp on June 14, 1940, to produce artificial rubber and gas oline from coal. The Hitler govern- ment supplied political opponents and Jews as the s laves, who were worked to near death and then murdered. Arnold disclosed that Standard Oil of N.J. (later k nown as Exxon), of which Farish was president and chief executive, had agreed to stop h iding from the United States patents for artificial rubber which the company had provide d to the Nazis. 4 A Senate investigating committee under Senator (lat er U.S. President) Harry Truman of Missouri had called Arnold to testify at hearing s on U.S. corporations' collaboration with the Nazis. The Senators expressed outrage at t he cynical way Farish was continuing an alliance with the Hitler regime that had begun b ack in 1933, when Farish became chief of Jersey Standard. Didn't he know there was a war on? The Justice Department laid before the committee a letter, written to Standard president Farish by his vice president, shortly aft er the beginning of World War II (Sept 1, 1939) in Europe. The letter concerned a re newal of their earlier agreements with the Nazis: Report on European Trip Oct. 12, 1939 Mr. W.S. Farish 30 Rockefeller Plaza Dear Mr. Farish:...

[emphasis added] Very truly yours, F[rank] A. Howard 5 Here are some cold realities behind the tragedy of World War II, which help explain the Bush-Farish family alliance — and their peculiar clo seness to the Queen of England: * Shell Oil is principally owned by the British roya l family. Shell's chairman, Sir Henri Deterding, helped sponsor Hitlers rise to power/by arrangement with the royal family's Bank of England Governor, Montagu Norman. Their ally Standard Oil would take part in the Hitler project right up to the bloody, gruesome end. * When grandfather Farish signed the Justice Depart ment's consent decree in March 1942, the government had already started picking it s way through the tangled web of world-monopoly oil and chemical agreements between Standard Oil and the Nazis. Many patents and other Nazi-owned aspects of the pa rtnership had been seized by the U.S. Alien Property Custodian. Uncle Sam would not seize Prescott Bush's Union Banki ng Corporation for another seven months. The Bush-Farish axis had begun back in 1929. In that year the Harriman bank bought Dresser Industries, supplier of oil-pipeline couple rs to Standard and other companies, Prescott Bush became a director and financial czar o f Dresser, installing his Yale class- mate Neil Mahlon as chairman. 7 George Bush would later name one of his sons after the Dresser executive. William S. Farish was the main organizer of the Hum ble Oil Co. of Texas, which Far- ish merged into the Standard Oil Company of New Jers ey. Farish built up the Humble- Standard empire of pipelines and refineries in Texa s. 8 The stock market crashed just after the Bush family got into the oil business. The world financial crisis led to the merger of the Wal ker-Harriman bank with Brown Broth- ers in 1931. Former Brown partner Montagu Norman and his protege Hjalmar Schacht paid frantic visits to New York that year and the n ext, preparing the new Hitler regime for Germany. The most important American political event in thos e preparations for Hitler was the infamous \"Third International Congress on Eugeni cs,\" held at New York's American Museum of Natural History August 21 -23, 1932, supe rvised by the International Federa- tion of Eugenics Societies. 9 This meeting took up the stubborn persistence of A frican- Americans and other allegedly \"inferior\" and \"socia lly inadequate\" groups in reproducing, expanding their numbers, and amalgamating with othe rs. It was recommended that these \"dangers\" to the \"better\" ethnic groups and to the \"well-born,\" could be dealt with by sterilization or \"cutting off the bad stock\" of the \"unfit.\" Italy's fascist government sent an official represe ntative. Averell Harriman's sister Mary, director of \"Entertainment\" for the Congress, lived down in Virginia fox-hunting country; her state supplied the speaker on \"racial purity,\" W.A. Plecker, Virginia commissioner of vital statistics. Plecker reportedly held the deleg ates spellbound with his account of the struggle to stop race-mixing and inter-racial sex i n Virginia. The Congress proceedings were dedicated to Averell H arriman's mother; she had paid for the founding of the race-science movement in Am erica back in 1910, building the 283"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Eugenics Record Office as a branch of the Galton Nat ional Laboratory in London. She and other Harrimans were usually escorted to the ho rse races by old George Herbert Walker — they shared with the Bushes and the Farishe s a fascination with \"breeding thoroughbreds\" among horses and humans. 10 Averell Harriman personally arranged with the Walke r/Bush Hamburg-Amerika Line to transport Nazi ideologues from Germany to New Yo rk for this meeting. 11 The most famous among those transported was Dr. Ernst Rudin, psychiatrist at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Genealogy and Demography in Berlin, wh ere the Rockefeller family paid for Dr. Rudin to occupy an entire floor with his eugenic s \"research.\" Dr. Rudin had addressed the International Federation's 1928 Munich meeting, speaking on \"Mental Aberration and Race Hygiene,\" while others (Germans and America ns) spoke on race-mixing and sterilization of the unfit. Riidin had also led the German delegation to the 1930 Mental Hygiene Congress in Washington, D.C. At the Harrimans' 1932 New York Eugenics Congress, E rnst Riidin was unanimously elected president of the International Federation o f Eugenics Societies. This was recogni- tion of Riidin as founder of the German Society for Race Hygiene, with his co-founder, Eugenics Federation vice president Alfred Plotz. As depression-maddened financiers schemed in Berlin and New York, Riidin was now official leader of the world eugenics movement. Comp onents of his movement included groups with overlapping leadership, dedicated to: • sterilization of mental patients (\"mental hygiene s ocieties\"); • execution of the insane, criminals and the terminal ly ill (\"euthanasia societies\"): and • eugenical race-purification by prevention of births to parents from \"inferior\" blood stocks (\"birth control societies\"). Before the Auschwitz death camp became a household w ord, these British-American- European groups called openly for the elimination o f the \"unfit\" by means including force and violence. 12 Ten months later, in June 1933, Hitler's interior m inister Wilhelm Frick spoke to a eugenics meeting in the new Third Reich. Frick calle d the Germans a \"degenerate\" race, denouncing one-fifth of Germany's parents for produ cing \"feeble-minded\" and \"defec- tive\" children. The following month, on a commissio n by Frick, Dr. Ernst Riidin wrote the \"Law for the Prevention of Hereditary Diseases in Posterity,\" the sterilization law modeled on previous U.S. statutes in Virginia and o ther states. Special courts were soon established for the steril ization of German mental patients, the blind, the deaf and alcoholics. A quarter milli on people in these categories were sterilized. Riidin, Plotz and their colleagues train ed a whole generation of physicians and psychiatrists — as sterilizers and as killers. When the war started, the eugenicists, doctors and psychiatrists staffed the new \"T4\" agency, which planned and supervised the mass killi ngs: first at \"euthanasia centers,\" where the same categories which had first been subject to sterilization were now to be murdered, their brains sent in lots of 200 to experimental ps ychiatrists; then at slave camps such as Auschwitz; and finally, for Jews and other race vic tims, at straight extermination camps in Poland, such as Treblinka and Belsen. 13 In 1933, as what Hitler called his \"New Order\" appe ared, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. appointed William S. Farish the chairman of Standar d Oil Co. of New Jersey (in 1937 he was made president and chief executive). Farish mov ed his offices to Rockefeller Center, New York, where he spent a good deal of time with H ermann Schmitz, chairman of 284"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"R ACE H YGIENE -. T HREE B USH F AMILY A LLIANCES I.G. Farben; his company paid a publicity man, Ivy Lee, to write pro-I.G. Farben and pro-Nazi propaganda and get it into the U.S. press. Now that he was outside of Texas, Farish found hims elf in the shipping business — like the Bush family. He hired Nazi German crews for Stan dard Oil tankers. And he hired Emil Helfferich, chairman of the Walker/Bush/Harriman Ham burg-Amerika Line, as chairman also of the Standard Oil Company subsidiary in Germa ny. Karl Lindemann, board member of Hamburg-Amerika, also became a top Farish-Standa rd executive in Germany.'\" 14 This interlock between their Nazi German operations put Farish together with Prescott Bush in a small, select group of men operating from abroad through Hitler's \"revolution,\" and calculating that they would never be punished. In 1939, Farish's daughter Martha married Averell H arriman's nephew, Edward Har- riman Gerry, and Farish in-laws became Prescott Bus h's partners at 59 Broadway. 15 Both Emil Helfferich and Karl Lindemann were authori zed to write checks to Hein- rich Himmler, chief of the Nazi S.S., on a special Standard Oil account. This account was managed by the German-British-American banker, K urt von Schroeder. According to U.S. intelligence documents reviewed by author A ntony Sutton, Emil Helfferich continued his payments to the S.S. into 1944, when the S.S. was supervising the mass murder at the Standard-I.G. Farben Auschwitz and ot her death camps. Helfferich told Allied interrogators after the war that these were not his personal contributions — they were corporate Standard Oil funds. 16 After pleading \"no contest\" to charges of criminal conspiracy with the Nazis, William Stamps Farish was fined $5,000. (Similar fines were levied against Standard Oil — $5,000 each for the parent company and for several subsidi aries.) This of course did not interfere with the millions of dollars that Farish had acquir ed in conjunction with Hitler's New Order, as a large stockholder, chairman and preside nt of Standard Oil. All the govern- ment sought was the use of patents which his compan y had given to the Nazis — the Auschwitz patents — but had withheld from the U.S. military and industry. But a war was on, and if young men were to be asked to die fighting Hitler ... some- thing more was needed. Farish was hauled before the Senate committee investigating the national defense program. The committee chairma n, Senator Harry Truman, told newsmen before Farish testified: \"I think this appr oaches treason.\" 17 Farish began breaking apart at these hearings. He s houted his \"indignation\" at the Senators, and claimed he was not \"disloyal.\" After the March-April hearings ended, more dirt cam e gushing out of the Justice Department and the Congress on Farish and Standard O il. Farish had deceived the U.S. Navy to prevent the Navy from acquiring certain pat ents, while supplying them to the Nazi war machine; meanwhile, he was supplying gasol ine and tetraethyl lead to Germany's submarines and air force. Communications between Sta ndard and I.G. Farben from the outbreak of World War II were released to the Senat e, showing that Farish's organiza- tion had arranged to deceive the U.S. government in to passing over Nazi-owned assets: They would nominally buy I.G.'s share in certain pa tents because \"in the event of war between ourselves and Germany ... it would certainl y be very undesirable to have this 20 percent Standard-I.G. pass to an alien property custodian of the U.S. who might sell it to an unfriendly interest.\" 18 John D. Rockefeller, Jr. (father of David, Nelson an d John D. Rockefeller III), con- trolling owner of Standard Oil, told the Roosevelt a dministration that he knew nothing of the day-to-day affairs of his company, that all these matters were handled by Farish and other executives. 19 285"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"F LESHING Our S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIEP . In August, Farish was brought back for more testimo ny. He was now frequently ac- cused of lying. Farish was crushed under the intens e, public grilling; he became morose, ashen. While Prescott Bush escaped publicity when t he government seized his Nazi banking organization in October, Farish had been na iled. He collapsed and died of a heart attack on Nov. 29, 1942. The Farish family was devastated by the exposure. S on William Stamps Farish, Jr., a lieu- tenant in the Army Air Force, was humiliated by the public knowledge that his father was fueling the enemy's aircraft; he died in a training accident in Texas six months later. 20 With this double death, the fortune comprising much of Standard Oil's profits from Texas and Nazi Germany was now to be settled upon t he little four-year-old grandson, William (\"Will\") Stamps Farish III. Will Farish gre w up a recluse, the most secretive multi-millionaire in Texas, with investments of \"th at money\" in a multitude of foreign countries, and a host of exotic contacts overlappin g the intelligence and financial worlds — particularly in Britain. The Bush-Farish axis started George Bush's career. Af ter his 1948 graduation from Yale (and Skull and Bones), George Bush flew down to Texas on a corporate airplane and was employed by his father's Dresser Industries . In a couple of years he got help from his uncle, George Walker, Jr., and Farish's Bri tish banker friends, to set him up in the oil property speculation business. Soon thereaf ter, George Bush founded the Zapata Oil Company, which put oil drilling rigs into certai n locations of great strategic interest to the Anglo-American intelligence community. Will Farish at 25 years old was a personal aide to Zapata chairman George Bush in Bush's unsuccessful 1964 campaign for Senate. Will F arish used \"that Auschwitz money\" to back George Bush financially, investing in Zapata . When Bush was elected to Congress in 1966, Farish joined the Zapata board. 21 When George Bush became U.S. Vice President in 1980, the Farish and Bush family fortunes were again completely, secretly commingled . As we shall see, the old projects were now being revived on a breathtaking scale. B USH AND D RAPER _______________________________________ TWENTY YEARS BEFORE HE WAS U.S. PRESIDENT, George B ush brought two \"race-sci- ence\" professors in front of the Republican Task For ce on Earth Resources and Popula- tion. As chairman of the Task Force, then-Congressma n Bush invited Professors William Shockley and Arthur Jensen to explain to the commit tee how allegedly runaway birth-rates for African-Americans were \"down-breeding\" the Amer ican population. Afterwards Bush personally summed up for the Congress the testimony his black- inferiority advocates had given to the Task Force. 22 George Bush held his hearings on the threat posed by black babies on August 5, 1969, while much of the world was in a better frame of mind — celebrating mankind's progre ss from the first moon landing 16 days earlier. Bush's obsessive thinking on this subj ect was guided by his family's friend, Gen. William H. Draper, Jr., the founder and chairm an of the Population Crisis Com- mittee, and vice chairman of the Planned Parenthood Federation. Draper had long been steering U.S. public discussion about the so-called \"population bomb\" in the non-white areas of the world. If Congressman Bush had explained to his colleagues h ow his family had come to know General Draper, they would perhaps have felt some a larm, or even panic, and paid more healthy attention to Bush's presentation. Unfortunat ely, the Draper-Bush population doctrine is now official U.S. foreign policy. 286"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"R ACE H YGIENE : T HREE B USH F AMILY A LLIANCES William H. Draper, Jr. had joined the Bush team in 1 927, when he was hired by Dillon Read & Co., New York investment bankers. Drape r was put into a new job slot at the firm: handling the Thyssen account. We recall that in 1924, Fritz Thyssen set up his Un ion Banking Corporation in George Herbert Walker's bank at 39 Broadway, Manhatt an. Dillon Read & Co.'s boss, Clarence Dillon, had begun working with Fritz Thysse n sometime after Averell Harri- man first met with Thyssen — at about the time Thys sen began financing Adolf Hitler's political career. In January 1926, Dillon Read created the German Credi t and Investment Corporation in Newark, New Jersey and Berlin, Germany, as Thysse n's short-term banker. That same year Dillon Read created the Vereinigte Stahlwerke ( German Steel Trust), incorporating the Thyssen family interests under the direction of New York and London finance. 23 William H. Draper, Jr. was made director, vice pres ident and assistant treasurer of the German Credit and Investment Corp. His business was s hort-term loans and financial management tricks for Thyssen and the German Steel Trust. Draper's clients sponsored Hitler's terroristic takeover; his clients led the buildup of the Nazi war industry; his clients made war against the United States. The Nazis were Drapers direct partners in Berlin and New Jersey: Alexander Kreuter, residing in Berli n, was president; Frederic Brandi, whose father was a top coal executive in the German Steel Trust, moved to the U.S. in 1926 and served as Draper's co-director in Newark. Draper's role was crucial for Dillon Read & Co., for whom Draper was a partner and eventually vice president. The German Credit and Inv estment Corp. (GCI) was a \"front\" for Dillon Read: It had the same New Jersey address as U.S. & International Securities Corp. (USIS), and the same man served as treasurer o f both firms. 24 Clarence Dillon and his son C. Douglas Dillon were di rectors of USIS, which was spotlighted when Clarence Dillon was hauled before t he Senate Banking Committee's famous \"Pecora\" hearings in 1933. USIS was shown to be one of the great speculative pyramid schemes which had swindled stockholders of hundreds of millions of dollars. These investment policies had rotted the U.S. econo my to the core, and led to the Great Depression of the 1930s. But William H. Draper, Jr. s GCI \"front\" was not appa rently affiliated with the USIS \"front\" or with Dillon, and the GCI escaped the Congr essmen's limited scrutiny. This oversight was to prove most unfortunate, particular ly to the 50 million people who subsequently died in World War II. Dillon Read hired public relations man Ivy Lee to pr epare their executives for their testimony and to confuse and further baffle the Cong ressmen. 25 Lee apparently took enough time out from his duties as image-maker for William S. Farish and the Nazi I.G. Farben Co.; he managed the congressional thinki ng so that the Congressmen did not disturb the Draper operation in Germany — and d id not meddle with Thyssen, or interfere with Hitler's U.S. moneymen. Thus in 1932, William H. Draper, Jr. was free to fi nance the International Eugenics Congress as a \"Supporting Member.\" 26 Was he using his own income as a Thyssen trust banker? Or did the funds come from Dillon Read corpo rate accounts, perhaps to be written off income tax as \"expenses for German project: rac e purification\"? Draper helped select Ernst Riidin as chief of the world eugenics movement , who used his office to promote what he called Adolf Hitler's \"holy, national and intern ational racial hygienic mission.\" 27 W.S. Farish, as we have seen, was publicly exposed in 1942, humiliated and destroyed. Just before Farish died, Prescott Bush's Nazi bankin g office was quietly seized and shut 287"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET Society down. But Prescott's close friend and partner in the Thyssen-Hitler business, William H. Draper, Jr., neither died nor moved out of Germa n affairs. Draper listed himself as a director of the German Credit and Investment Corp. th rough 1942, and the firm was not liquidated until November 1943. 28 But a war was on; Draper, a colonel from previous military service, went off to the Pacific theater a nd became a general. General Draper apparently had a hobby: magic — illu sions, sleight of hand, etc. — and he was a member of the Society of American Ma gicians. This is not irrelevant to his subsequent career. The Nazi regime surrendered in May 1945. In July 19 45, General Draper was called to Europe by the American military government autho rities in Germany. Draper was appointed head of the Economics Division of the U.S . Control Commission. He was assigned to take apart the Nazi corporate cartels. There is an astonishing but perfectly logical rationale to this — Draper knew a lot about the subject! General Draper, who had spent about 15 years financing and managing the dirtiest of the Nazi enterprises, was now authorized to decide who was exposed, who l ost and who kept his business, and in practical effect, who was prosecuted for war crimes . 29 (Draper was not unique within the postwar occupatio n government. Consider the case of John J. McCloy, U.S. Military Governor and H igh Commissioner of Germany, 1949-1952. Under instructions from his Wall Street law firm, McCloy had lived for a year in Italy, serving as an advisor to the fascist government of Benito Mussolini. An intimate collaborator of the Harriman/Bush bank, McCl oy had sat in Adolf Hitler's box at the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin, at the invitati on of Nazi chieftains Rudolf Hess and Hermann Goring.) 30 William H. Draper, Jr., as a \"conservative,\" was pa ired with the \"liberal\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau in a vicious game. Morge nthau demanded that Germany be utterly destroyed as a nation, that its industry be dismantled and it be reduced to a purely rural country. As the economic boss in 1945 and 194 6, Draper \"protected\" Germany from the Morgenthau Plan ... but at a price. Draper and his colleagues demanded that Germany and the world accept the collec- tive guilt of the German people as the explanation for the rise of Hitler's New Order, and the Nazi war crimes. This, of course, was rather co nvenient for General Draper himself, as it was for the Bush family. It is still convenien t decades later, allowing Prescott's son, President Bush, to lecture Germany on the danger of Hitlerism. Germans are too slow, it seems, to accept his New World Order. After several years of government service (often wo rking directly for Averell Harri- man in the North Atlantic Alliance), General Draper was appointed in 1958 chairman of a committee which was to advise President Dwight Eisenhower on the proper course for U.S. military aid to other countries. At that t ime, Prescott Bush was a U.S. Senator from Connecticut, a confidential friend and golf par tner with National Security Director Gordon Gray, and an important golf partner with Dwi ght Eisenhower as well. Prescott's old lawyer from the Nazi days, John Foster Dulles, was Secretary of State, and his brother Allen Dulles, formerly of the Schroder bank, was he ad of the CIA. This friendly environment emboldened General Draper to pull off a stunt with his military aid advisory committee. He changed the sub ject under study. The following year the Draper committee recommended that the U.S. gove rnment react to the supposed threat of the \"population explosion\" by formulating plans to depopulate the poorer coun- tries. The growth of the world's non-white populati on, he proposed, should be regarded as dangerous to the national security of the United States! 31 288"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"R ACE H YGIENE : T HREE B USH F AMILY A LLIANCES President Eisenhower rejected the recommendation. Bu t in the next decade, General Draper founded the \"Population Crisis Committee\" and the \"Draper Fund,\" joining with the Rockefeller and Du Pont families to promote eugenics as \"population control.\" The administration of President Lyndon Johnson, adv ised by General Draper on the subject, began financing birth control in the tropi cal countries through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). General Draper was George Bush's guru on the populat ion question. 32 But there was also Draper's money — from that uniquely horrible s ource — and Draper's connections on Wall Street and abroad. Draper's son and heir, W illiam H. Draper III, was co-chairman for finance (chief of fundraising) of the Bush-for-P resident national campaign organiza- tion in 1980. With George Bush in the White House, t he younger Draper heads up the depopulation activities of the United Nations throu ghout the world. General Draper was vice president of Dillon Read unt il 1953. During the 1950s and 1960s, the chief executive there was Frederic Brandi , the German who was Draper's co- director for the Nazi investments and his personal contact man with the Nazi German Steel Trust. Nicholas Brady was Brandi's partner from 1954, and replaced him as the firm's chief executive in 1971. Nicholas Brady, who knows w here all the bodies are buried, was chairman of his friend George Bush's 1980 election c ampaign in New Jersey, and has been United States Treasury Secretary throughout Bu sh's presidency. 35 B USH AND G RAY ___________________________________________________ _ The U.S. A GENCY FOR I NTERNATIONAL D EVELOPMENT says that surgical sterilization is the Bush administration's \"first choice\" method o f population reduction in the Third World. 34 The United Nations Population Fund claims that 37 p ercent of contraception users in Ibero-America and the Caribbean have already been surgically sterilized. In a 1991 report, William H. Draper Ill's agency asserts that 254 million couples will be surgically sterilized over the course of the 1990s; and that i f present trends continue, 80 percent of the women in Puerto Rico and Panama will be surgica lly sterilized. 35 The U.S. government pays directly for these sterili zations. Mexico is first among targeted nations, on a list w hich was drawn up in July 1991, at a USAID strategy session. India and Brazil are secon d and third priorities, respectively. On contract with the Bush administration, U.S. perso nnel are working from bases in Mexico to perform surgery on millions of Mexican me n and women. The acknowledged strategy in this program is to sterilize those youn g adults who have not already completed their families. George Bush has a rather deep-seated personal feelin g about this project, in particular as it pits him against Pope John Paul II in Catholic countries such as Mexico. (See Chapter 4 below, on the origin of a Bush family grudge in th is regard.) The spending for birth control in the non-white cou ntries is one of the few items that is headed upwards in the Bush administration budget. As its 1992 budget was being set, USAID said its Population Account would receive $30 0 million, a 20 percent increase over the previous year. Within this project, a sign ificant sum is spent on political and psychological manipulations of target nations, and rather blatant subversion of their religions and governments. 36 These activities might be expected to cause serious objections from the victimized nationalities, or from U.S. taxpayers, especially i f the program is somehow given wide- spread publicity. 289"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Quite aside from moral considerations, legal questi ons would naturally arise, which could be summed up: How does George Bush think he ca n get away with this? In this matter the President has expert advice. Mr. (Clayland) Boyden Gray has been counsel to George Bush since the 1980 election. As c hief legal officer in the White House, Boyden Gray can walk the President through t he dangers and complexities of waging such unusual warfare against Third World pop ulations. Gray knows how these things are done. When Boyden Gray was four and five years old, his fa ther organized the pilot project for the present worldwide sterilization program, fr om the Gray family household in North Carolina. It started in 1946. The eugenics movement was looki ng for a way to begin again in America. Nazi death camps such as Auschwitz had just then se ared the conscience of the world. The Sterilization League of America, which had chan ged its name during the war to \"Birthright, Inc.,\" wanted to start up again. First they had to overcome public nervousness about crackpots proposing to eliminate \"inferior\" a nd \"defective\" people. The League tried to surface in Iowa, but had to back off becau se of negative publicity: A little boy had recently been sterilized there and had died fro m the operation. They decided on North Carolina, where the Gray famil y could play the perfect host. Through British imperial contacts, Boyden Gray's gran dfather, Bowman Gray, had be- come principal owner of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. Boyden's father, Gordon Gray, had recently founded the Bowman Gray (memorial) Medi cal School in Winston-Salem, using his inherited cigarette stock shares. The med ical school was already a eugenics center. As the experiment began, Gordon Gray's great aunt, Alice Shelton Gray, who had raised him from childhood, was living in his househ old. Aunt Alice had founded the \"Human Betterment League,\" the North Carolina branch of the national eugenical sterilization movement. Aunt Alice was the official supervisor of the 1946- 47 experiment. Working under Miss Gray was Dr. Claude Nash Herndon, whom Gordon Gray h ad made assistant professor of \"medical genetics\" at Bowman Gray Medical School. Dr. Clarence Gamble, heir to the Proctor and Gamble soap fortune, was the sterilizers' national field operations chief. The experiment worked as follows. All children enro lled in the school district of Win- ston-Salem, N. C. were given a special \"intelligenc e test.\" Those children who scored below a certain arbitrary low mark were then cut open and s urgically sterilized. We quote now from the official story of the project : 37 In Winston-Salem and in [nearby] Orange County, Nor th Carolina, the [Sterilization League's] field committee had participated in testi ng projects to identify school age children who should be considered for sterilization. The pro ject in Orange County was conducted by the University of North Carolina and was financed b y a 'Mr. Hanes,' a friend of Clarence Gamble and supporter of the field work project in N orth Carolina. The Winston-Salem project was also financed by Hanes.\" [\"Hanes\" was underwear mogul James Gordon Hanes, a trustee of Bowman Gray Medical School and treasurer of Alic e Gray's group]... The medical school had a long history of interest i n eugenics and had compiled extensive histories of families carrying inheritable disease. In 1946, Dr. C. Nash Herndon ... made a state- ment to the press on the use of sterilization to pr event the spread of inheritable diseases... 290"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"R ACE H YGIENE : T HREE B USH F AMILY A LLIANCES The first step after giving the mental tests to gra de school children was to interpret and make public the results. In Orange County the resul ts indicated that three percent of the school age children were either insane or feeblemin ded... [Then] the field committee hired a social worker to review each case ... and to pres ent any cases in which sterilization was indicated to the State Eugenics Board, which under North Carolina law had the authority to order sterilization... Race science experimenter Dr. Claude Nash Herndon pro vided more details in an interview in 1990: 38 Alice Gray was the general supervisor of the projec t. She and Hanes sent out letters promoting the program to the commissioners of all 1 00 counties in North Carolina... What did I do? Nothing besides riding herd on the whole thing! The social workers operated out of my office. I was at the time also director of ou tpatient services at North Carolina Baptist Hospital. We would see the [targeted] parents and c hildren there... I.Q. tests were run on all the children in the Winston-Salem public school sys tem. Only the ones who scored really low [were targeted for sterilization], the real bottom of the barrel, like below 70. Did we do sterilizations on young children? Yes. Th is was a relatively minor operation... It was usually not until the child was eight or ten years old. For the boys, you just make an incision and tie the tube... We more often performe d the operation on girls than with boys. Of course, you have to cut open the abdomen, but ag ain, it is relatively minor. Dr. Herndon remarked coolly that \"we had a very goo d relationship with the press\" for the project. This is not surprising, since Gordon G ray owned the Winston-Salem Journal, the Twin City Sentinel and radio station WSJS. In 1950 and 1951, John Foster Dulles, then chairman of the Rockefeller Founda- tion, led John D. Rockefeller III on a series of wor ld tours, focusing on the need to stop the expansion of the non-white populations. In November 1952, Dulles and Rockefeller set up the Population Council, with tens of millions of dollars from the Rockefeller family. At that point, the American Eugenics Society, still cautious from the recent bad publicity vis-a-vis Hitler, left its old headquarte rs at Yale University. The Society moved its headquarters into the office of the Population Council, and the two groups melded together. The long-time secretary of the American E ugenics Society, Frederick Osborne, became the first president of the Population Council . The Gray family's child-sterilizer, Dr. Claude Nash Herndon, became president of the Ame rican Eugenics Society in 1953, as its work expanded under Rockefeller patronage. Meanwhile, the International Planned Parenthood Fed eration was founded in London, in the offices of the British Eugenics Society. The undead enemy from World War II, renamed \"Popula tion Control,\" had now been revived. George Bush was U.S. ambassador to the United Nation s in 1972, when with prod- ding from Bush and his friends, the U.S. Agency for International Development first made an official contract with the old Sterilizatio n League of America. The League had changed its name twice again, and was now called th e \"Association for Voluntary Surgi- cal Contraception.\" The U.S. government began paying the old fascist group to sterilize non-whites in foreign countries. The Gray family experiment had succeeded. 291"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY In 1988, the U.S. Agency for International Developm ent signed its latest contract with the old Sterilization League (a.k.a. Association fo r Voluntary Surgical Contraception), committing the U.S. government to spend $80 million over five years. Having gotten away with sterilizing several hundred North Carolina school children, \"not usually less than eight to ten years old,\" the identical group is now authorized by President Bush to do it to 58 countries in Asia, Af rica and Ibero-America. The group modestly claims it has directly sterilized \"only\" t wo million people, with 87 percent of the bill paid by U.S. taxpayers. Meanwhile, Dr. Clarence Gamble, Boyden Gray's favor ite soap manufacturer, formed his own \"Pathfinder Fund\" as a split-off from the S terilization League. Gamble's Path- finder Fund, with additional millions from USAID, c oncentrates on penetration of local social groups in the non-white countries, to break down psychological resistance to the surgical sterilization teams.

Three days before this note to Moscow was written, George Bush had parachuted fr om a Navy bomber airplane over the Pacific Ocean, killing his two crew members whe n the unpiloted plane crashed. Five months later, in February 1945, Prescott's bos s, Averell Harriman, escorted President Franklin Roosevelt to the fateful summit m eeting with Soviet leader Joseph Stalin at Yalta. In April Roosevelt died. The agreem ent reached at Yalta, calling for free elections in Poland once the war ended, was never e nforced. Over the next eight years (1945 through 1952), Pres cott Bush was Harriman's anchor in the New York financial world. The increasingly p owerful Mr. Harriman and his allies gave Eastern Europe over to Soviet dictatorship. A Cold War was then undertaken, to \"counterbalance\" the Soviets. This British-inspired strategy paid several nightmar ish dividends. Eastern Europe was to remain enslaved. Germany was \"permanently\" divid ed. Anglo-American power was jointly exercised over the non-Soviet \"Free World.\" The confidential functions of the British and American governments were merged. The Ha rriman clique took possession of the U.S. national security apparatus, and in doi ng so, they opened the gate and let the Bush family in. Following his services to Germany's Nazi Party, Ave rell Harriman spent several years mediating between the British, American and Soviet g overnments in the war to stop the Nazis. He was ambassador to Moscow from 1943 to 194 6. President Harry Truman, whom Harriman and his frien ds held in amused contempt, appointed Harriman U.S. ambassador to Britain in 194 6. Harriman was at lunch with former British Prime Mini ster Winston Churchill one day in 1946, when Truman telephoned. Harriman asked Chur chill if he should accept Tru- man's offer to come back to the U.S. as Secretary o f Commerce. According to Harriman's account, Churchill told him: \"Absolutely. The cente r of power is in Washington.\" 1 J UPITER I SLAND ______________________________________________ T HE REORGANIZATION OF THE A MERICAN GOVERNMENT after World War II — the creation of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency alo ng British lines, for example — had devastating consequences. We are concerned here wit h only certain aspects of that overall transformation, those matters of policy and family which gave shape to the life and mind of George Bush, and gave him access to power. It was in these postwar years that George Bush atten ded Yale University, and was inducted into the Skull and Bones society. The Bush family's h ome at that time was in Greenwich, Connecticut. But it was just then that George's paren ts, Prescott and Dorothy Walker Bush, were wintering in a peculiar spot in Florida, a place that is excluded from mention in literature originating from Bush circles. Certain national news accounts early in 1991 feature d the observations on President Bush's childhood by his elderly mother Dorothy. She was said to be a resident of Hobe Sound, Florida. More precisely, the President's mot her lived in a hyper-security arrange- ment created a half-century earlier by Averell Harr iman, adjacent to Hobe Sound. Its correct name is Jupiter Island. During his political career, George Bush has claimed many different \"home\" states, including Texas, Maine, Massachusetts and Connectic ut. It has not been expedient for him to claim Florida, though that state has a vital link to his role in the world, as we shall see. And George Bush's home base in Florida, t hroughout his adult life, has been Jupiter Island. 296"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"T HE C ENTER OF P OWER IS IN W ASHINGTON The unique, bizarre setup on Jupiter Island began i n 1931, following the merger of W.A. Harriman & Co. with the British-American firm Br own Brothers. The reader will recall Mr. Samuel Pryor, the \"Merch ant of Death.\" A partner with the Harrimans, Prescott Bush, George Walker and Naz i boss Fritz Thyssen in banking and shipping enterprises, Sam Pryor remained execut ive committee chairman of Rem- ington Arms. In this period, the Nazi private armie s (S.A. and S.S.) were supplied with American arms — most likely by Pryor and his compan y — as they moved to overthrow the German republic. Such gun-running as an instrum ent of national policy would later become notorious in the \"Iran-Contra\" affair. Samuel Pryor's daughter Permelia married Yale gradu ate Joseph V. Reed on the last day of 1927. Reed immediately went to work for Presc ott Bush and George Walker as an apprentice at WA. Harriman & Co. During World War II, Joseph V. Reed had served in th e \"special services\" section of the U.S. Army Signal Corps. A specialist in security , codes and espionage, Reed later wrote a book entitled Fun with Cryptograms. 2 Now, Sam Pryor had had property around Hobe Sound, Florida, for some time. In 1931, Joseph and Permelia Pryor Reed bought the enti rety of Jupiter Island. This is a typically beautiful Atlantic coast \"barri er island,\" a half-mile wide and nine miles long. The middle of Jupiter Island lies just off Hobe Sound. The south bridge connects the island with the town of Jupiter, to th e north of Palm Beach. It is about 90 minutes by auto from Miami — today, a few minutes b y helicopter. Early in 1991, a newspaper reporter asked a friend of the Bush family about security arrangements on Jupiter Island. He responded, \"If y ou called up the White House, would they tell you how many security people they had? It 's not that Jupiter Island is the White House, although he [George Bush] does come down freq uently.\" But for several decades before Bush was President, Ju piter Island had an ordinance requiring the registration and fingerprinting of al l housekeepers, gardeners and other non-residents working on the island. The Jupiter Is land police department says that there are sensors in the two main roads that can track ev ery automobile on the island. If a car stops in the street, the police will be there withi n one or two minutes. Surveillance is a duty of all employees of the town of Jupiter Island . News reporters are to be prevented from visiting the island. 3 To create this astonishing private club, Joseph and Permelia Pryor Reed sold land only to those who would fit in. Permelia Reed was st ill the grande dame of the island when George Bush was inaugurated President in 1989. In recognition of the fact that the Reeds know where all the bodies are buried, Pres ident Bush appointed Permelia's son, Joseph V. Reed, Jr., chief of protocol for the U.S. State Department, in charge of private arrangements with foreign dignitaries. Averell Harriman made Jupiter Island a staging grou nd for his 1940s takeover of the U.S. national security apparatus. It was in that co nnection that the island became pos- sibly the most secretive private place in America. Let us briefly survey the neighborhood, back then i n 1946-48, to see some of the uses various of the residents had for the Harriman cliqu e. R ESIDENTS ON J UPITER I SLAND ________________________________ Jupiter Islander ROBERT A. LOVETT, 4 Prescott Bush's partner at Brown Brothers Har- riman, had been Assistant Secretary of War for Air from 1941 to 1945. Lovett was the leading American advocate of the policy of terror-b ombing of civilians. He organized 297"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIET )- the Strategic Bombing Survey, carried out for the Am erican and British governments by the staff of the Prudential Insurance Company, guide d by London's Tavistock Psychiatric Clinic. In the postwar period, Prescott Bush was associated with Prudential Insurance, one of Lovett's intelligence channels to the British secret services. Prescott was listed by Prudential as a director of the company for about two years in the early 1950s. Their Strategic Bombing Survey failed to demonstrate any real military advantage accruing from such outrages as the fire-bombing of Dresden, Germany. But the Har- rimanites nevertheless persisted in the advocacy of terror from the air. They glorified this as \"psychological warfare,\" a part of the Utopian m ilitary doctrine opposed to the views of military traditionalists such as Gen. Douglas Ma cArthur. Robert Lovett later advised President Lyndon Johnson to terror-bomb Vietnam. Presi- dent George Bush revived the doctrine with the bombi ng of civilian areas in Panama, and the destruction of Baghdad. On Oct. 22, 1945, Secretary of War Robert Patterson created the Lovett Committee, chaired by Robert A. Lovett, to advise the governmen t on the post-World War II orga- nization of U.S. intelligence activities. The exist ence of this committee was unknown to the public until an official CIA history was release d from secrecy in 1989. But the CIA's author (who was President Bush's prep school history teacher; see chapter 5) gives no real details of the Lovett Committee's functioning, claim ing: \"The record of the testimony of the Lovett Committee, unfortunately, was not in t he archives of the agency when this account was written.\" 5 The CIA's self-history does inform us of the advice that Lovett provided to the Truman cabinet, as the official War Department intelligenc e proposal. Lovett decided that there should be a separate Centr al Intelligence Agency. The new agency would \"consult\" with the armed forces, but i t must be the sole collecting agency in the field of foreign espionage and counterespion age. The new agency should have an independent budget, and its appropriations shoul d be granted by Congress without public hearings. Lovett appeared before the Secretaries of State, Wa r and Navy on November 14, 1945. He spoke highly of the FBI's work because it h ad \"the best personality file in the world.\" Lovett said the FBI was expert at producing false documents, an art \"which we developed so successfully during the war and at whi ch we became outstandingly adept.\" Lovett pressed for a virtual resumption of the wart ime Office of Strategic Services (OSS in a new CIA. U.S. military traditionalists centered around Gen. Douglas MacArthur opposed Lovett's proposal. The continuation of the OSS had been attacked at th e end of the war on the grounds that the OSS was entirely under British control, and that it would constitute an Americar.

Joan's father, grandfather and uncle were members of the Skull and Bones secret society. Charles Payson organized a uranium refinery in 1948. Later he was chairman of Vitro Corp., makers of parts for submarine-launched ballis tic missiles, equipment for frequency surveillance and torpedo guidance, and other subsur face weaponry. Naval warfare has long been a preoccupation of the British Empire.

This traditional covert British ori entation in the U.S. Navy, Naval Intelligence and the Navy's included service, the M arine Corps, forms a backdrop to the career of George Bush — and to the whole neighborhoo d on Jupiter Island.

Lansky officially moved to Florida in 1953/ GEORGE HERBERT WALKER, J R (Skull and Bones 1927), was extremely close to his nephew George Bush, helping to sponsor his entry int o the oil business in the 1950s. \"Uncle Herbie\" was also a partner of Joan Whitney P ayson when they co-founded the New York Mets baseball team in 1960. His son, G.H. Walker III, was a Yale classmate of Nicholas Brady and Moreau D. Brown (Thatcher Brown' s grandson), forming what was called the \"Yale Mafia\" on Wall Street. WALTER S. CARPENTER, J R had been chairman of the finance committee of the Du Pont Corporation (1930-40). In 1933, Carpenter ove rsaw Du Pont's purchase of Remington Arms from Sam Pryor and the Rockefellers, a nd led Du Pont into partner- ship with the Nazi I.G. Farben Company for the manuf acture of explosives. Carpenter became Du Pont's president in 1940. His cartel with the Nazis was broken up by the U.S. government. Nevertheless, Carpenter remained Du Pont 's president as the company's technicians participated massively in the Manhattan Project to produce the first atomic bomb. He was chairman of Du Pont from 1948 to 1962, retaining high-level access to U.S. strategic activities. Walter Carpenter and Prescott Bush were fellow activi sts in the Mental Hygiene Society. Originating at Yale University in 1908, th e movement had been organized into the World Federation of Mental Health by Montagu No rman, himself a frequent mental patient, former Brown Brothers partner and Bank of Eng land Governor. Norman had ippointed as the federation's chairman, Brigadier Jo hn Rawlings Rees, director of the Tavistock Psychiatric Clinic, chief psychiatrist and psychological warfare expert for the British intelligence services.

His father, Clarence Dil- lon, created the Vereinigte Stahlwerke (Thyssen's G erman Steel Trust) in 1926. C. Douglas Dillon made Nicholas Brady the chairman of the Dillo n Read firm in 1971 and himself continued as chairman of the executive committee. C. Douglas Dillon would be a vital ally of his neighbor Prescott Bush during the Eisen hower administration. Publisher NELSON DOUBLEDAY headed his family's publi shing firm, founded under the auspices of J.P. Morgan and other British Empire representatives. When George Bush's \"Uncle Herbie\" died, Doubleday took over as majorit y owner and chief executive of the New York Mets baseball team. GEORGE W. MERCK, chairman of Merck & Co., drug and che mical manufacturers, was director of the War Research Service: Merck was the official chief of all U.S. research into biological warfare from 1942 until at least th e end of World War II. After 1944. Merck's organization was placed under the U.S. Chemi cal Warfare Service. His family firm in Germany and the U.S. was famous for its man ufacture of morphine. A.L.

In 1965, just after performing a rather dirty favor fo r George Bush (see Chapter 9), Cole became chairman of the executive committee of the D igest, the world's largest-circula- tion periodical. From the late 1940s, Jupiter Island has served as a center for the direction of covert action by the U.S. government and, indeed, for the covert management of the government. Jupiter Island will reappear later on, in our account of Ge orge Bush in the Iran-Contra affair. TARGET: WASHINGTON _________________________________ ________________ GEORGE W. BUSH GRADUATED FROM YALE IN 1948. He soon en tered the family's Dresser oil supply concern in Texas. We shall now b riefly describe the forces that descended on Washington, D.C. during those years when Bush, wit h the assistance of family and powerful friends, was becoming \"established in busi ness on his own.\" From 1948 to 1950, Prescott Bush's boss Averell Harr iman was U.S. \"ambassador-at- large\" to Europe. He was a non-military \"theater co mmander,\" the administrator of the multi-billion-dollar Marshall Plan, participating i n all military/strategic decision-making by the Anglo-American alliance. The U.S. Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal, had become a problem to the Har- rimanites. Forrestal had long been an executive at Dillon Read on Wall Street. But ir recent years he had gone astray. As Secretary of th e Navy in 1944, Forrestal proposed the racial integration of the Navy. As Defense Secr etary he pressed for integration in the armed forces and this eventually became the U.S. po licy. Forrestal opposed the Utopians' strategy of appease ment coupled with brinkmanship. He was simply opposed to communism. On March 28, 19 49, Forrestal was forced out of office and flown on an Air Force plane to Florid a. He was taken to \"Hobe Sound\" (Jupiter Island), where Robert Lovett and an army ps ychiatrist dealt with him. 8 300"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"T HE C ENTER OE P OWER IS IN W ASHINGTON He was flown back to Washington, locked in Walter Re ed Army Hospital and given insulin shock treatments for alleged \"mental exhaus tion.\" He was denied all visitors except his estranged wife and children — his son had been Averell Harriman's aide in Moscow, On May 22, James Forrestal's body was found, his ba throbe cord tied tightly around his neck, after he had plunged from a sixteenth-story h ospital window. The chief psychiatrist called the death a suicide even before any investig ation was started. The results of the Army's inquest were kept secret. Forrestal's diarie s were published, 80 percent deleted, after a year of direct government censorship and re writing. North Korean troops invaded South Korea in June 195 0, after U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson (Harriman's very close friend) publicl y specified that Korea would not be defended. With a new war on, Harriman came back to serve as President Truman's adviser, to \"oversee national security affairs.\" Harriman replaced Clark Clifford, who had been specia l counsel to Truman. Clifford, however, remained close to Harriman and his partner s as they gained more and more power. Clifford later wrote about his cordial relati ons with Prescott Bush: Prescott Bush ... had become one of my frequent gol fing partners in the fifties, and I had both liked and respected him... Bush had a splendid singing voice, and particularly loved quartet singing. In the fifties, he organized a qua rtet that included my daughter Joyce... They would sing in Washington, and, on occasion, he invi ted the group to Hobe Sound in Florida to perform. His son [George], though, had never str uck me as a strong or forceful person. In 1988, he presented himself successfully to the vote rs as an outsider — no small trick for a man whose roots wound through Connecticut, Yale, Texas oil, the CIA, a patrician background, wealth, and the Vice-Presidency. 9 With James Forrestal out of the way, Averell Harrim an and Dean Acheson drove to Leesburg, Virginia, on July 1, 1950, to hire the Bri tish-backed U.S. Gen. George C. Marshall as Secretary of Defense. At the same time, Prescott's partner, Robert Lovett, himself became Assistant Secretary of Defense. Lovett, Marshall, Harriman and Acheson went to work to unhorse Gen. Douglas MacArthur, commander of U.S. forces in Asia. MacArt hur kept Wall Street's intelligence agencies away from his command, and favored real in dependence for the non-white nations. Lovett called for MacArthur's firing on Ma rch 23, 1951, citing MacArthur's insistence on defeating the Communist Chinese invade rs in Korea. MacArthur's famous message, that there was \"no substitute for victory, \" was read in Congress on April 5; MacArthur was fired on April 10, 1951. That September, Robert Lovett replaced Marshall as S ecretary of Defense. Meanwhile, Harriman was named director of the Mutual Security Agency, making him the U.S. chief of the Anglo-American military alliance. By n ow, Brown Brothers Harriman was everything but Commander-in-Chief.

A central focus of the Harriman security regime in Washington (1950-53) was the organization of covert operations, and \"psychologic al warfare.\" Harriman, together with his lawyers and business partners, Allen Dulle s and John Foster Dulles, wanted the government's secret services to conduct extensi ve propaganda campaigns and mass- psychology experiments within the U.S.A., and param ilitary campaigns abroad. This would supposedly ensure a stable world-wide environ ment favorable to Anglo-American financial and political interests. The Harriman security regime created the Psychologi cal Strategy Board (PSB) in 1951. The man appointed director of the PSB, Gordon Gray, is familiar to the reader as the sponsor of the child sterilization experiments, car ried out by the Harrimanite eugenics movement in North Carolina following World War II (s ee Chapter 3). Gordon Gray was an avid Anglophile, whose father ha d gotten controlling ownership of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company through alliance with the British Imperial To- bacco cartel's U.S. representatives, the Duke famil y of North Carolina. Gordon's brother, R.J. Reynolds chairman Bowman Gray, Jr., was also a Na val Intelligence officer, known around Washington as the \"founder of operational in telligence.\" Gordon Gray became a close friend and political ally of Prescott Bush; an d Gray's son became for Prescott's son, George, his lawyer and the shield of his covert pol icy. But President Harry Truman, as malleable as he was, constituted an obstacle to the co- vert warriors. An insular Missouri politician vague ly favorable to the U.S. Constitution, he remained skeptical about secret service activities that reminded him of the Nazi Gestapo. So, \"covert operations\" could not fully take off wi thout a change of the Washington regime. And it was with the Republican Party that Pr escott Bush was to get his turn. Prescott had made his first attempt to enter nation al politics in 1950, as his partners took control of the levers of governmental power. Re maining in charge of Brown Brothers Harriman, he ran against Connecticut's William Benton for a seat in the U.S. Senate. (The race was for a two-year unexpired term, left e mpty by the death of the previous Senator.) In those days, Wisconsin's drunken Senator Joseph R. McCarthy was making a circus- like crusade against communist influence in Washing ton. McCarthy attacked liberals and leftists, State Department personnel, politicians a nd Hollywood figures. He generally left unscathed the Wall Street and London strategis ts who donated Eastern Europe and China to communist dictatorship — like George Bush, t heir geopolitics was beyond left and right. 302"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"T HE C ENTER OF P OWER IS IN W ASHINGTON Prescott Bush had no public ties to the notorious Jo e McCarthy, and appeared to be neutral about his crusade. But the Wisconsin Senator had his uses. Joe McCarthy came into Connecticut three times that year to campaign f or Bush and against the Democrats. Bush himself made charges of \"Korea, Communism and Cor ruption\" into a slick campaign phrase against Benton, which then turned up as a nat ional Republican slogan. The response was disappointing. Only small crowds t urned out to hear Joe Mc- Carthy, and Benton was not hurt. McCarthy's pro-Bush ra lly in New Haven, in a hall that seated 6,000, drew only 376 people. Benton joke d on the radio that \"200 of them were my spies.\" Prescott Bush resigned from the Yale Board of Fellows for his campaign, and the board published a statement to the effect that the \"Yale vote\" should support Bush — despite the fact that William Benton was a Yale man, and in many ways identical in outlook to Bush. Yale's Whiffenpoof singers appeared regularly for Prescott's campaign. None of this was particularly effective, however, with the votin g population. 10 Then Prescott Bush ran into a completely unexpected problem. At that time, the old Harriman eugenics movement was centered at Yale Uni versity. Prescott Bush was a Yale trustee, and his former Brown Brothers Harriman partn er, Lawrence Tighe, was Yale's treasurer. In that connection, a slight glimmer of the truth about the Bush-Harriman firm's Nazi activities now made its way into the ca mpaign. Not only was the American Eugenics Society itself h eadquartered at Yale, but all parts of this undead fascist movement had a busy home at Yale. The coercive psychiatry and sterilization advocates had made the Yale/New Haven Hospital and Yale Medical School their laboratories for hands-on practice in brain s urgery and psychological experimenta- tion. And the Birth Control League was there, which had long trumpeted the need for eugenical births — fewer births for parents with \"i nferior\" bloodlines. Prescott's partner Tighe was a Connecticut director of the league, and the Connecticut league's medical advisor was eugenics advocate Dr. Winternitz of Yal e Medical School. Now in 1950, people who knew something about Presco tt Bush knew that he had very unsavory roots in the eugenics movement. There were then, just after the anti-Hitler war, few open advocates of sterilization of \"unfit\" or \"unnecessary\" people. (That would be revived later, with the help of General Draper a nd his friend George Bush.) But the Birth Control League was public — just about then it was changing its name to the euphemistic \"Planned Parenthood.\" Then, very late in the 1950 senatorial campaign, Pr escott Bush was publicly exposed for being an activist in that section of the old fa scist eugenics movement. Prescott Bush lost the election by about 1,000 out of 862,000 vot es. He and his family blamed the defeat on the expose. The defeat was burned into th e family's memory, leaving a bitter- ness and perhaps a desire for revenge. In his foreword to a population control propaganda book, George Bush wrote about that 1950 election: \"My own first awareness of birt h control as a public policy issue came with a jolt in 1950 when my father was running for United States Senate in Con- necticut. Drew Pearson, on the Sunday before Electi on day, \"revealed' that my father was involved with Planned Parenthood... Many political observers felt a sufficient number of voters were swayed by his alleged contacts with the birth controllers to cost him the election...\" 11 Prescott Bush was defeated, while the other Republic an candidates fared well in Con- necticut. When he tried again, Prescott Bush would n ot leave the outcome to the blind whims of the public. 303"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Prescott Bush moved into action again in 1952 as a national leader of the push to give the Republican presidential nomination to Gen. Dwigh t D. (\"Ike\") Eisenhower. Among the other team members were Bush's Hitler-era lawyer John Foster Dulles, and Jupiter Islander C. Douglas Dillon. Dillon and his father were the pivots as the Harrim an-Dulles combination readied Ike for the presidency. As a friend put it: \"When t he Dillons ... invited [Eisenhower] to dinner it was to introduce him to Wall Street banke rs and lawyers.\" 12 Ike's higher-level backers believed, correctly, tha t Ike would not interfere with even the dirtiest of their covert action programs. The bland , pleasant Prescott Bush was in from the beginning: a friend to Ike, and an original bac ker of his presidency. On July 28, 1952, as the election approached, Connec ticut's senior U.S. Senator. James O'Brien McMahon, died at the age of 48.* This was extremely convenient for Prescott. He got the Republican nomination for U.S. Senator at a special delegated meeting, with backin g by the Yale-dominated state party leadership. Now he would run in a special election for the suddenly vacant Senate seat. He could expect to be swept into office, since he woul d be on the same electoral ticket as the popular war hero, General Ike. By a technicality, h e would instantly become Connecticut's senior Senator, with extra power in Congress. And th e next regularly scheduled senatorial race would be in 1956 (when McMahon's term would ha ve ended), so Prescott could run again in that presidential election year — once aga in on Ike's coattails! With this arrangement, things worked out very smoot hly. In Eisenhower's 1952 election victory, Ike won Connecticut by a margin of 129,507 votes out of 1,092,471. Prescott Bush came in last among the statewide Republ icans, but managed to win by 30,373 out of 1,088,799 votes case, his margin near ly 100,000 behind Eisenhower. He took the traditionally Republican towns. In Eisenhower's 1956 reelection, Ike won Connecticut by 303,036 out of 1,114,954 votes, the largest presidential margin in Connecticu t's history. Prescott Bush managed to win again, by 129,544 votes out of 1,085,206 — his margin this time 290,082 smaller than Eisenhower's. 13 In January 1963, when this electoral strategy had b een played out and his second term ex- pired, Prescott Bush retired from government and ret urned to Brown Brothers Harriman The 1952 Eisenhower victory made John Foster Dulles Secretary of State, and his brother Allen Dulles head of the CIA. The reigning D ulles brothers were the \"Republi- can\" replacements for their client and business par tner, \"Democrat\" Averell Harriman. Occasional public posturings aside, their strategic commitments were identical to his. Undoubtedly the most important work accomplished by Prescott Bush in the new regime was on the golf links, where he was Ike's fa vorite partner. T OWARD THE \"N ATIONAL S ECURITY S TATE \" _____________________________________ Prescott Bush was a most elusive, secretive Senator . By diligent research, his views on some issues may be traced: He was opposed to the de velopment of public power projects like the Tennessee Valley Authority; he opposed the constitutional amendment introduced by Ohio Senator John W Bricker, which would have req uired congressional approval of international agreements by the executive branch. But Prescott Bush was essentially a covert operative in Washington. * McMahon had been Assistant U.S. Attorney General, in charge of the Criminal Division, from 1935 to 1 939. Was there a chance he might someday speak out about the unpunished Nazi-era crimes of rhe wealthy and powe rful? 304"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"T HE C ENTER OF P OWER IS IN W ASHINGTON On June 10, 1954, Bush received a letter from Connect icut resident H. Smith Rich- ardson, owner of Vick Chemical Company (cough drops, Vapo-Rub): \"... At some time before Fall, Senator, I want to g et your advice and counsel on a [new] subject — namely what should be done with the income from a foundation which my brother and I set up, and which will begin its o peration in 1956.. .\" 14 This letter presages the establishment of the H. Sm ith Richardson Foundation, a Bush family-dictated private slush fund which was to be utilized by the Central Intelligence Agency, and by Vice President Bush, for the conduct of his Iran-Contra adventures. The Bush family knew Richardson and his wife through their mutual friendship with Sears Roebuck's chairman, Gen. Robert E. Wood. Genera l Wood had been president of the America First organization, which had lobbie d against war with Hitler Germany. H. Smith Richardson had contributed the start-up mon ey for America First and had spoken out against the U.S. \"joining the Communists\" by fighting Hitler. Richardson's wife was a proud relative of Nancy Langehorne from Virginia, who married Lord Astor and backed the Nazis from their Cliveden Estate. General Wood's daughter Mary had married the son of Standard Oil president William Scamps Farish. The Bushes had stuck with the Farishe s through their disastrous exposure during World War II (see Chapter 3). Young George Bus h and his bride Barbara were especially close to Mary Farish, and to her son WS. Farish III, who would be the great confidante of George's presidency. 15 The H. Smith Richardson Foundation was organized by Eugene Stetson, Jr., Rich- ardson's son-in-law. Stetson (Skull and Bones, 1934 ) had worked for Prescott Bush as assistant manager of the New York branch of Brown Bro thers Harriman. In the late 1950s, the H. Smith Richardson Foundatio n took part in the \"psychological warfare\" of the CIA. This was not a foreign, but a d omestic, covert operation, carried out mainly against unwitting U.S. citizens. CIA Director Allen Dulles and his British allies organized \"MK-Ultra,\" the testing of psychotropic d rugs including LSD on a very large scale, allegedly to evaluate \"chemical warfare\" pos sibilities. In this period, the Richardson Foundation helped finance experiments at Bridgewater Hospital in Massachusetts, the center of some of the most brutal MK-Ultra tortures . These outrages have been graphi- cally portrayed in the movie, Titticut Follies. During 1990, an investigator for this book toured H . Smith Richardson's Center for Creative Leadership just north of Greensboro, No rth Carolina. The tour guide said that in these rooms, agents of the Central Intellige nce Agency and the Secret Service are trained. He demonstrated the two-way mirrors throug h which the government employ- ees are watched, while they are put through mind-be nding psychodramas. The guide explained that \"virtually everyone who becomes a ge neral\" in the U.S. armed forces also goes through this \"training\" at the Richardson Center . Another office of the Center for Creative Leadership is in Langley, Virginia, at the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency. Her e also, Richardson's Center trains leaders of the CIA. Prescott Bush worked throughout the Eisenhower year s as a confidential ally of the Dulles brothers. In July 1956, Egypt's President Ga mel Abdul Nasser announced he would accept the U.S. offer of a loan for the const ruction of the Aswan Dam project. John Foster Dulles then prepared a statement tellin g the Egyptian ambassador that the U.S.A. had decided to retract its offer. Dulles gav e the explosive statement in advance to Prescott Bush for his approval. Dulles also gave th e statement to President Eisenhower, and to the British government. 16 305"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Nasser reacted to the Dulles brush-off by nationali zing the Suez Canal to pay for the dam. Israel, then Britain and France, invaded Egypt to try to overthrow Nasser, leader of the anti-imperial Arab nationalists. However, Eisen hower refused (for once) to play the Dulles-British game, and the invaders had to leave E gypt when Britain was threatened with U.S. economic sanctions. During 1956, Senator Prescott Bush's value to the Ha rriman-Dulles political group increased when he was put on the Senate Armed Servi ces Committee. Bush toured U.S. and allied military bases throughout the world, and had increased access to the national security decision-making process. In the later years of the Eisenhower presidency, Go rdon Gray rejoined the govern- ment. As an intimate friend and golfing partner of Prescott Bush, Gray complemented the Bush influence on Ike. The Bush-Gray family partn ership in the \"secret government\" continues up through the George Bush presidency. Gordon Gray had been appointed head of the new Psyc hological Strategy Board in 1951 under Averell Harriman's rule as assistant to President Truman for national security affairs. From 1958 to 1961, Gordon Gray was nationa l security chief under President Eisenhower. Gray acted as Ike's intermediary, strat egist and hand-holder, in the President's relations with the CIA and the U.S. and allied milit ary forces. Eisenhower did not oppose the CIA's covert action pr ojects; he only wanted to be protected from the consequences of their failure or exposure. Gray's primary task, in the guise of \"oversight\" on all U.S. covert action, was to protect and hide the growing mass of CIA and related secret government activities. It was not only covert projects which were develope d by the Gray-Bush-Dulles com- bination; it was also new, hidden structures of the United States government. Senator Henry Jackson challenged these arrangements in 1959 and 1960. Jackson created a Subcommittee on National Policy Machinery of the Senate Committee on Governmental Operations, which investigated Gordon Gray's reign at the National Security Council. On January 26, 1960, Gordon Gray w arned President Eisenhower that a document revealing the existence of a secret part of the U.S. government had somehow gotten into the bibliography being used by Senator Jackson. The unit was Gray's \"5412 Group\" within the administration, offi cially but secretly in charge of approving covert action. Under Gray's guidance, Ike \"'was clear and firm in his re- sponse' that Jackson's staff not be informed of the existence of this unit [emphasis in the original].\" 17 Several figures of the Eisenhower administration mu st be considered the fathers of this permanent covert action monolith, men who cont inued shepherding the monster after its birth in the Eisenhower era: GORDON GRAY, the shadowy assistant to the President for national security affairs. Prescott Bush's closest executive branch crony and golf partner along with Eisenhower. By 1959-60, Gray had Ike's total confidence and ser ved as the Harrimanites' monitor on all U.S. military and non-military projects. British intelligence agent Kim Philby defected to th e Russians in 1963. Philby had gained virtually total access to U.S. intelligence activities beginning in 1949, as the British secret services' liaison to the Harriman-dom inated CIA. After Philby's defection, it seemed obvious that the aristocratic British inte lligence service was in fact a menace to the western cause. In the 1960s, a small team of U.S. counterintelligence specialists went to England to investigate the situation. They reported back that the British secret service could be thoroughly trusted.

The center came to be directed by Frank Barnett, former program officer of the Bush family's H. Smith Richardson Foundation. The center conduited funds to the London-Based Forum World Features, for the circulation of CIA-aut hored \"news stories\" to some 300 newspapers internationally. 18 \"Democrat\" Averell Harriman rotated back into offic ial government in the Kennedy administration.

Yet he was perhaps more than anyone the leader and the glue for the incredible evil that was hatched by the CIA in the f inal Eisenhower years: a half-public, half-private Harrimanite army, never since demobili zed, and increasingly associated with the name of Bush. Following the rise of Castro, the U.S. Central Intell igence Agency contracted with the organization of Mafia boss Meyer Lansky to organize and train assassination squads for use against the Cuban government. Among those employ ed were John Rosselli, Santos Trafficante and Sam Giancana. Uncontested public do cumentation of these facts has been published by congressional bodies and by leading Es tablishment academics. 19 But the disturbing implications and later consequenc es of this engagement are a crucial matter for further study by the citizens of every n ation. This much is established: On Aug. 18, 1960, President Eisenhower approved a $ 13 million official budget for a secret CIA-run guerrilla war against Castro. It is known that Vice President Richard M. Nixon took a hand in the promotion of this initi ative. The U.S. military was kept out of the covert action plans until very late in t he game.

The invasion of Cuba by the CIA's anti-Castro exiles was put off until after John Kennedy took over the presidency. The invasion at the Bay of Pigs was a fiasco, and Cas tro's forces easily prevailed. But the program continued. In 1960, Felix Rodriguez, Luis Posada Carriles, Rafael \"Chi Chi\" Quintero, Frank Sturgis (or \"Frank Fiorini\") and other Florida-base d Cuban exiles were trained as kill- ers and drug-traffickers in the Cuban initiative; th eir supervisor was E. Howard Hunt. Their overall CIA boss was Miami station chief Theod ore G. Shackley, seconded by Thomas Clines. In later chapters we will follow the subsequent careers of these characters — increasingly identified with George Bush — through the Watergate coup, and the Iran-Contra scandal.

H ONEYMOON _____________________________________________ BARBARA PIERCE QUIT SMITH COLLEGE in her sophomore year to marry George. Prescott and Mother Bush gave a splendid prenuptial dinner at the Greenwich Field Club. The wedding took place January 6, 1945, in the Rye, New York Presbyterian Church, as the U.S. Third Fleet bombarded the main Philippine isla nd of Luzon in preparation for inva- sion. Afterwards there was a glamorous reception fo r 300 at Appawamis Country Club. The newlyweds honeymooned at The Cloisters, a five-s tar hotel on Sea Island, Georgia, with swimming, tennis and golf. George's next assignment was to train pilots at Nor folk, Virginia Naval Air Station. \"George's duty ... was light. As for other young ma rrieds, whose husbands were between warzone tours, this was kind of an extended (and pa id) honeymoon.\" 2 Japan surrendered in August. That fall, George and Barbara Bush moved to New Haven where Bush entered Yale University. He and Barbara mo ved into an apartment at 37 Hill- house Avenue, across the street from Yale President Charles Seymour. College life was good to George, what he saw of it. A college career usually occupies four years. But we know that George Bush is a rapidly moving man. Thus he was pleased with the special arrangement made for veterans, by which Yale allowed him to get his degree after attending classes for only two and a h alf years. Bush and his friends remember it all fondly, as repr esentatives of the Fashionable Set: \"[M] embers of [Bush's] class have since sighed with nostalgia for those days of the late 1940s ...

Bush, the Pr esident's namesake. By the time of his 1948 graduation, he had been ele cted to Phi Beta Kappa, an honor traditionally associated with academic achievement. A great deal is known about George Bush's career at Yale, except the part about books a nd studies. Unfortunately for those who would wish to consider his intellectual accompl ishment, everything about that has been sealed shut and is top secret. The Yale admini stration says they have turned over to the FBI custody of all of Bush's academic records, al legedly because the FBI needs such access to check the resumes of important office hol ders. From all available testimony, his mental life befor e college was anything but outstand- ing. His campaign literature claims that, as a vete ran, Bush was \"serious\" at Yale. But we cannot check exactly how he achieved election to Phi Beta Kappa, in his abbreviated college experience. Without top secret clearance, w e cannot consult his test results, read his essays, or learn much about his performance in class. We know that his father was a trustee of the university, in charge of \"developmen tal\" fundraising. And his family friends were in control of the U.S. secret services. A great deal is known, however, about George Bush's status at Yale. His fellow student John H. Chafee, later a U.S. Sena tor from Rhode Island and Secretary of the Navy, declared: \"We didn't see muc h of him because he was married, but I guess my first impression was that he was — a nd I don't mean this in a derogatory fashion — in the inner set, the movers and shakers, the establishment. I don't mean he put on airs or anything, but ... just everybody kne w him.\" Chafee, like Bush, and Dan Quayle, was in the importa nt national fraternity, Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE or the \"Dekes\"). But Chafee says, \"I never remember seeing him there. He wasn't one to hang around with the fellow s.\" 4 T HE T OMB _______________________________________________ EORGE BUSH, IN FACT, PASSED his most important days an d nights at Yale in the strange companionship of the senior-year Skull and Bones Society. 5 Out of those few who were chosen for Bones membershi p, George was the last one to be notified of his selection — this honor is tra ditionally reserved for the highest of the high and mighty. His father, Prescott Bush, several other relatives a nd partners, and Roland and Averell Harriman, who sponsored the Bush family, were also m embers of this secret society. The undoubted political and financial power associa ted with Skull and Bones has given rise to many popular questions about the nature and origin of the group. Its members have fed the mystery with false leads and silly spe culations. The order was incorporated in 1856 under the name \" Russell Trust Association.\" By special act of the state legislature in 1943, it s trustees are exempted from the normal requirement of filing corporate reports with the Con necticut Secretary of State. As of 1978, all business of the Russell Trust was ha ndled by its lone trustee, Brown Brothers Harriman partner John B. Madden, Jr. Madden started with Brown Brothers Harriman in 1946, under senior partner Prescott Bush , George Bush's father. Each year, Skull and Bones members select (\"tap\") 1 5 third-year Yale students to replace them in the senior group the following year .

T HE R ACIST N IGHTMARE AT Y ALE called \"Patriarchs,\" give special backing in busine ss, politics, espionage and legal careers to graduate Bonesmen who exhibit talent or usefulnes s. The home of Skull and Bones on the Yale campus is a stone building resembling a mausoleum, and known as \"the Tomb.\" Initiations tak e place on Deer Island in the St. Lawrence River (an island owned by the Russell Trust Association), with regular reunions on Deer Island and at Yale. Initiation rites report edly include strenuous and traumatic activities of the new member, while immersed naked in mud, and in a coffin. More important is the \"sexual autobiography\": The initia te tells the Order all the sex secrets of his young life. Weakened mental defenses against manipulation, and the blackmail potential of such information, have obvious permane nt uses in enforcing loyalty among members. The loyalty is intense. One of Bush's former teacher s, whose own father was a Skull and Bones member, told our interviewer that his fath er used to stab his little Skull and Bones pin into his skin to keep it in place when he took a bath. Members continue throughout their lives to unburden themselves on their psycho- sexual thoughts to their Bones Brothers, even if they are no longer sitting in a coffin. This has been the case with President George Bush, f or whom these ties are reported to have a deep personal meaning. Beyond the psychologic al manipulation associated with freemasonic mummery, there are very solid political reasons for Bush's strong identifica- tion with this cult. Observers of Skull and Bones, apologists and critics alike, have accepted various decep- tive notions about the order. There are two outstan ding, among these falsehoods: 1) that it is essentially an American group, an ass embly of wealthy, elite \"patriots\"; it is in fact, an agency for British Empire penetrat ion and subversion of the American republic; and 2) that it is somehow the unique center of conspira torial control over the United States. This misconception is certainly understandable, giv en the rather astonishing number of powerful, historically important and grotesquely an ti-human individuals, who have come out of Skull and Bones. But there are in fact congrue nt organizations at other Ivy League colleges, which reflect, as does Skull and Bones, th e over-arching oligarchical power of several heavily intermarried financier families. The mistaken, speculative notions may be corrected by examining the history of Skull and Bones, viewed within the reality of the American Eastern Establishment. Skull and Bones — the Russell Trust Association — was first established among the class graduating from Yale in 1833. Its founder was William Huntington Russell of Middletown, Connecticut. The Russell family was th e master of incalculable wealth derived from the largest U.S. criminal organization of the nineteenth century: Russell and Company, the great opium syndicate. There was at that time a deep suspicion of, and nat ional revulsion against, freemasonry and secret organizations in the United States, fost ered in particular by the anti-masonic writings of former U.S. President John Quincy Adams . Adams stressed that those who take oaths to politically powerful international se cret societies cannot be depended on for loyalty to a democratic republic. But the Russells were protected as part of the multi ply-intermarried grouping of families then ruling Connecticut (see accompanying c hart). The blood-proud members of the Russell, Pierpont, Edwards, Burr, Griswold, Da y, Alsop and Hubbard families were prominent in the pro-British party within the state. Many of their sons would be among the members chosen for the Skull and Bones Society over the years. 313"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY The background to Skull and Bones is a story of Opiu m and Empire, and a bitter struggle for political control over the new U.S. re public. Samuel Russell, second cousin to Bones founder Willia m H., established Russell and Company in 1823. Its business was to acquire opi um from Turkey and smuggle it into China, where it was strictly prohibited, under the armed protection of the British Empire. The prior, predominant American gang in this field had been the syndicate created by Thomas Handasyd Perkins of Newburyport, Massachu setts, an aggregation of the self-styled \"blue bloods\" or Brahmins of Boston's no rth shore. Forced out of the lucra- tive African slave trade by U.S. law and Caribbean s lave revolts, leaders of the Cabot, Lowell, Higginson, Forbes, Cushing and Sturgis fami lies had married Perkins siblings and children. The Perkins opium syndicate made the fortune and established the power of these families. By the 1830s, the Russells had b ought out the Perkins syndicate and made Connecticut the primary center of the U.S. opiu m racket. Massachusetts families (Coolidge, Sturgis, Forbes and Delano) joined Connect icut (Alsop) and New York (Low) smuggler-millionaires under the Russell auspices. John Quincy Adams and other patriots had fought the se men for a quarter century by the time the Russell Trust Association was set up wi th its open pirate emblem — Skull and Bones. With British ties of family, shipping and merchant b anking, the old New England Tories had continued their hostility to American in dependence after the Revolutionary War of 1775-83. These pretended conservative patrio ts proclaimed Thomas Jefferson's 1801 presidential inauguration \"radical usurpation. \" The Massachusetts Tories (\"Essex Junto\") joined wit h Vice President Aaron Burr, Jr. (a member of the Connecticut Edwards and Pierpont fa milies) and Burr's cousin and law partner Theodore Dwight, in political moves des igned to break up the United State and return it to British allegiance. The U.S. nationalist leader, former Treasury Secret ary Alexander Hamilton, exposed the plan in 1804. Burr shot him to death in a duel, then led a famous abortive conspiracy to form a new empire in the Southwest, with territo ry to be torn from the U.S.A. and Spanish Mexico. For the \"blue bloods,\" the romantic figure of Aaron Burr was ever af- terwards the symbol of British feudal revenge agains t the American republic. The Connecticut Tory families hosted the infamous Ha rtford Convention in 1815. toward the end of the second war between the U.S. a nd Britain (the War of 1812). Their secessionist propaganda was rendered impotent by Am erica's defensive military victory. This faction then retired from the open political a rena, pursuing instead entirely private and covert alliances with the British Empire. The in cestuously intermarried Massachusetts and Connecticut families associated themselves with the British East India Company in the criminal opium traffic into China. These familie s made increased profits as partners and surrogates for the British during the bloody 183 9-42 Opium War, the race war of British forces against Chinese defenders. Samuel and William Huntington Russell were quiet, wa ry builders of their faction's power. An intimate colleague of opium gangster Samu el Russell wrote this about him: While he lived, no friend of his would venture to m ention his name in print. While in China, he lived for about twenty-five years almo st as a hermit, hardly known outside of his factory [the Canton warehouse compound] exce pt by the chosen few who enjoyed his intimacy, and by his good friend, Hoqua [Chinese security director for the British 314"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"S KULL AND B ONUS -. T HE R ACIST N IGHTMARE AT Y ALE East India Company], but studying commerce in its b roadest sense, as well as its minutest details. Returning home with well-earned wealth he lived hospitably in the midst of his family, and a small circle of intimates. Scorning w ords and pretensions from the bottom of his heart, he was the truest and staunchest of f riends; hating notoriety, he could always be absolutely counted on for every good work which did not involve publicity. The Russells' Skull and Bones Society was the most i mportant of their domestic projects \"which did not involve publicity.\" A police-blotter type review of Russell's organizati on will show why the secret order, though powerful, was not the unique organ of \"consp iracy\" for the U.S. Eastern Estab- lishment. The following gentlemen were among Russell s' partners: • Augustine Heard (1785-1868): ship captain and pio neer U.S. opium smuggler. • John Cleve Green (1800-75): married to Sarah Gris wold; gave a fortune in opium profits to Princeton University, financing three Pr inceton buildings and four professor- ships: trustee of the Princeton Theological Seminar y for 25 years. • Abiel Abbott Low (1811-93): his opium fortune finan ced the construction of the Columbia University New York City campus; father of Co lumbia's president Seth Low. • John Murray Forbes (1813-98): his opium millions fi nanced the career of author Ralph Waldo Emerson, who married Forbes's daughter, and b ankrolled the establishment of the Bell Telephone Company, whose first president was For bes's son. • Joseph Coolidge: his Augustine Heard agency got $1 0 million yearly as surrogates for the Scottish dope-runners Jardine Matheson duri ng the fighting in China; his son organized the United Fruit Company; his grandson, Ar chibald Cary Coolidge, was the founding executive officer of the Anglo-Americans' Council on Foreign Relations. • Warren Delano, Jr.: chief of Russell and Co. in Cant on; grandfather of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. *• Russell Sturgis: his grandson by the same name wa s chairman of the Baring Bank in England, financiers of the Far East opium trade. Such persons as John C. Green and A.A. Low, whose na mes adorn various buildings at Princeton and Columbia Universities, made little attempt to hide the criminal origin of their influential money. Similarly with the Cabot s, the Higginsons and the Welds for Harvard. The secret groups at other colleges are an alogous and closely related to Yale's Skull and Bones. Princeton has its \"eating clubs,\" especially Ivy Clu b and Cottage Club, whose oligarchi- cal tradition runs from Jonathan Edwards and Aaron Burr through the Dulles brothers. At Harvard there is the ultra-blue-blooded Porcelia n (known also as the Porc or Pig club); Theodore Roosevelt bragged to the German Kaiser of h is membership there; Franklin Roosevelt was a member of the slightly \"lower\" Fly Cl ub. A few of the early initiates in Skull and Bones went on to careers in obvious defiance of the order's oligarchical character; two such wer e the scientists Benjamin Silliman, Jr. (Skull and Bones 1837), and William Chauvenet (Skull and Bones 1840). This reflects the continued importance of republican factions at Yale, Harvard and other colleges dur- ing the middle three decades of the nineteenth cent ury. Silliman and Chauvenet became enemies of everything Skull and Bones stood for, wh ile the Yale secret group rapidly conformed to the Russells' expectations. * Certain of the prominent Boston opium families, s uch as Cabot and Weld, did not affiliate directly with Russell, Connecticut and Yale, but were identi fied instead with Harvard. 315"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Yale was the northern college favored by southern s lave-owning would-be aristocrats. Among Yale's southern students were John C. Calhoun, later the famous South Carolina defender of slavery against nationalism, and Judah P. Benjamin, later Secretary of State for the slaveowners' Confederacy. Young South Carolinian Joseph Heatly Dulles, whose f amily bought their slaves with the money from contract-security work for the British conquerors in India, was in a previous secret Yale group, the \"Society of Brothe rs in Unity.\" At Yale Dulles worked with the Northern secessionists and attached himsel f to Daniel Lord; their two families clove together in the fashion of a gang. The Lords became powerful Anglo-American Wall Street lawyers, and J.H. Dulles's grandson was the father of Allen Dulles and John Foster Dulles. In 1832-33 Skull and Bones was launched under the Ru ssell pirate flag. Among the early initiates of the order were Henry Ro otes Jackson (S&B 1839), a leader of the 1861 Georgia Secession Convention and post-Civil War president of the Georgia Historical Society (thus the false accounts of the \"good old slavery days\" and the \"bad northern invaders\"); John Perkins, Jr. (S& B 1840), chairman of the 1861 Louisiana Secession Convention, who fled abroad for 13 years after the Civil War; and William Taylor Sullivan Barry (S&B 1841), a national leader of the secessionist wing of the Democratic Party during the 1850s, and chair man of the 1861 Mississippi Seces- sion Convention. Alphonso Taft was a Bonesman alongside William H. Rus sell in the Class of 1833. As U.S. Attorney General in 1876-77, Alphonso Taft helped organize the backroom settlement of the deadlocked 1876 presidential elec tion. The bargain gave Rutherford B. Hayes the presidency (1877-81) and withdrew the U .S. troops from the South, where they had been enforcing blacks' rights. Alphonso's son, William Howard Taft (S&B 1878), was U.S. President from 1909 to 1913. President Taft's son, Robert Alphonso Taft (S& B 1910), was a leading U.S. Senator after World War II; his family's Anglo-Saxon racial /ancestral preoccupation was the disease which crippled Robert Taft's leadership of American nationalist \"conservatives.\" Other pre-Civil War Bonesmen were: • William M. Evarts (S&B 1837): Wall Street attorney f or British and southern slaveowner projects, collaborator of Taft in the 18 76 bargain, U.S. Secretary of State 1877-81; • Morris R. Waite (S&B 1837): Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court 1874-88. whose rulings destroyed many rights of African-Amer icans gained in the Civil War; he helped his cohorts Taft and Evarts arrange the 1876 presidential settlement scheme to pull the rights-enforcing U.S. troops out of the So uth; • Daniel Coit Gilman (S&B 1852): co-incorporator of the Russell Trust; founding president of Johns Hopkins University as a great ce nter for the racialist eugenics move- ment; • Andrew D. White (S&B 1853): founding president of Cor nell University; psychic researcher; and diplomatic cohort of the Venetian, Russian and British oligarchies; • Chauncey M. Depew (S&B 1856): general counsel for th e Vanderbilt railroads, he helped the Harriman family to enter into high socie ty. By about the mid-1880s, the Skull and Bones membersh ip roster began to change from its earlier, often \"scholarly,\" coloration; the cha nge reflected the degradation of American political and economic life by imperialist, neo-pag an and racialist ideology. 316"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"S KULL AND B ONES -. T HE R ACIST N IGHTMARE AT Y ALE Irving Fisher (S&B 1888) became the racialist high p riest of the economics faculty (Yale professor 1896-1946), and a famous merchant o f British Empire propaganda for free trade and reduction of the non-white population. Fi sher was founding president of the American Eugenics Society under the financial large sse of Averell Harriman's mother. Gifford Pinchot (S&B 1889) invented the aristocrats' \"conservation\" movement. He was President Theodore Roosevelt's chief forester, s ubstituting federal land-control in place of Abraham Lincoln's free-land-to-families fa rm creation program. Pinchot's British Empire activitism included the Psychical Research So ciety and his vice-presidency of the first International Eugenics Congress in 1912. Helping Pinchot initiate this century's racialist e nvironmentalism were his cohorts George W. Woodruff (S&B 1889), Teddy Roosevelt's Assi stant Attorney General and Acting Interior Secretary; and Henry Solon Graves ( S&B 1892), chief U.S. forester 1910- 20. Frederick E. Weyerhaeuser (S&B 1896), owner of v ast tracts of American forest, was a follower of Pinchot's movement, while the Weyerha user family were active collaborators of British-South African super-racist Cecil Rhodes. Th is family's friendship with President George Bush is a vital factor in the present environ mentalist movement. With Henry L. Stimson (S&B 1888) we come to the East ern Liberal Establishment which has ruled America during the twentieth centur y. Stimson was President Taft's Secretary of War (1911-13), and President Herbert H oover's Secretary of State (1929- 33). As Secretary of War (1940-45), this time under President Harry Truman, Stimson pressed Truman to drop the atomic bomb on the Japan ese. This decision involved much more than merely \"pragmatic\" military consideration s. These Anglophiles, up through George Bush, have opposed the American republic's tr adition of alliance with national aspirations in Asia; and they worried that the inve ntion of nuclear energy would too powerfully unsettle the world's toleration for pove rty and misery. Both the U.S. and the Atom had better be dreaded, they thought. The present century owes much of its record of horr ors to the influential Anglophile American families which came to dominate and employ the Skull and Bones Society as a political recruiting agency, particularly the Harri mans, Whitneys, Vanderbilts, Rockefellers and their lawyers, the Lords and Tafts and Bundys. The politically aggressive Guaranty Trust Company, run almost entirely by Skull and Bones initiates, was a financial vehicle of these familie s in the early 1900s. Guaranty Trust's support for the Bolshevik and Nazi revolutions overlapped t he more intense endeavors in these fields by the Harrimans, George Walker and Prescott Bush a few blocks away, and in Berlin. Skull and Bones was dominated from 1913 onward by th e circles of Averell Harri- man. They displaced remaining traditionalists such as Douglas MacArthur from power in the United States. For George Bush, the Skull and Bones Society is more than simply the British, as op- posed to the American, strategic tradition. It is m erged in the family and personal network within which his whole life has been, in a sense, h anded to him prepackaged.

The Yale Unit's leader was amateur pilot Ro bert A. Lovett. They were based first on Long Island, New York, then in Palm Beach, Florid a. The Yale Unit has been described by Lovett's family and friends in a collective biog- raphy of the Harriman set: Training for the Yale Flying Unit was not exactly b oot camp. Davison's father ... helped finance them royally, and newspapers of the day dubbed them \"the millionaires' unit.\" They cut rakish figures, and knew it; though some dismissed them as dilettantes, the hearts of young Long Island belles fluttered at the sight .... [In] Palm Beach ... they ostentatiously pursued a r elaxed style. \"They were rolled about in wheel chairs by African slaves amid tropical gar dens and coconut palms,\" wrote the unit's historian... \"For light exercise, they learn ed to glance at their new wristwatches with an air of easy nonchalance\"... [Lovett] was made ch ief of the unit's private club, the Wags, whose members started their sentences, \"Being a Wag and therefore a superman\"... Despite the snide comments of those who dismissed t hem as frivolous rich boys, Lovett's unit proved to be daring and imaginative w arriors when they were dispatched for active duty in 1917 with Britain's Royal Naval Ai r Service. 6 Lovett was transferred to the U.S. Navy after the U .S. joined Britain in World War I. The Yale Flying Unit was the glory of Skull and Bon es. Roland Harriman, Prescott Bush and their 1917 Bonesmates selected for 1918 members hip in the secret order these Yale Flying Unit leaders: Robert Lovett, F. Trubee Daviso n, Artemus Lamb Gates, and John Martin Vorys. Unit flyers David Sinton Ingalls and F. Trubee's brother, Harry P. Davison (who became Morgan vice chairman), were tapped for the 1920 Skull and Bones. Lovett did not actually have a senior year at Yale: \"He was tapped for Skull and Bones not on the Old Campus but at a naval station in West Palm Beach; his initiation, instead of being conducted in the \"tomb' on High Street, oc curred at the headquarters of the Navy's Northern Bombing Group between Dunkirk and Cal ais.\" 7 Some years later, Averell Harriman gathered Lovett, Prescott Bush and other pets into the Utopian oligarchs' community a few miles to the north of Palm Beach, called Jupiter Island (see Chapter 4 [George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography]). British Empire loyalists flew right from the Yale Un it into U.S. strategy-making positions: • F. Trubee Davison was Assistant U.S. Secretary of W ar for Air from 1926 to 1933. David S. Ingalls (on the board of Jupiter Island's Pan American Airways) was meanwhile Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Aviation (1929- 32). Following the American Museum of Natural History's Hitlerite 1932 eugenics congre ss, Davison resigned his government Air post to become the Museum's president. Then, un der the Harriman-Lovett national security regime of the early 1950s, F. Trubee Davis on became Director of Personnel for the new Central Intelligence Agency. • Robert Lovett was Assistant Secretary of War for Air from 1941-45. • Lovett's 1918 Bonesmate Artemus Gates (chosen by Pre scott and his fellows) became Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air in 1941. Ga tes retained this post throughout the Second World War until 1945. Having a man like Gate s up there, who owed his posi- tion to Averell, Bob, Prescott and their set, was qu ite reassuring to young naval aviator George Bush; especially so, when Bush would have to w orry about the record being cor- rect concerning his controversial fatal crash. 318"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"S KULL AND B ONES : T HE R ACIST N IGHTMARE AT Y ALE O THER I MPORTANT B ONESMEN ________________________________________________ • Richard M. Bissell, Jr. was a very important man to the denizens of Jupiter Island. He graduated from Yale in 1932, the year after the Harrimanites bought the island. Though not in Skull and Bones, Bissell was the young er brother of William Truesdale Bisell, a Bonesman from the class of 1925. Their fath er, Connecticut insurance executive Richard M. Bissell, Sr., had put the U.S. insurance i ndustry's inside knowledge of all fire- insured industrial plants at the disposal of govern ment planners during World War I. The senior Bissell, a powerful Yale alumnus, was als o the director of the Neuro-Psy- chiatric Institute of the Hartford Retreat for the I nsane; there, in 1904, Yale graduate Clifford Beers underwent mind-destroying treatment wh ich led this mental patient to found the Mental Hygiene Society, a major Yale-base d Skull and Bones project. This would evolve into the CIA's cultural engineering eff ort of the 1950s, the drugs and brainwashing adventure known as \"MK-Ultra.\" Richard M. Bissell, Jr. studied at the London School of Economics in 1932 and 1933, and taught at Yale from 1935 to 1941. He then joine d Harriman's entourage in the U.S. government. Bissell was an economist for the Combined Shipping Adjustment Board in 1942-43, while Averell Harriman was the U.S. leader of that board in London. In 1947 and 1948, Bissell was executive secretary o f the \"Harriman Commission,\" otherwise known as the President's Commission on For eign Aid. When Harriman was the administrator of the Marshall Plan, Bissell was assistant administrator. Harriman was director of Mutual Security (1951-53), while Bissell was consultant to the director of Mutual Security 1952. Bissell then joined F. Trubee Davison at the Central Intelligence Agency. When Allen Dulles became CIA Director, Bissell was one of his th ree aides. Why could this be of interest to our Floridians? We saw in Chapter 4 [George Bush - The Unauthorized Biography], that the great anti-Ca stro covert initiative of 1959- 61 was supervised by an awesome array of Harriman a gents. We need now add to that assessment only the fact that the detailed manageme nt of the invasion of Cuba, and of the assassination planning, and the training of the squads for these jobs, was given into the hands of Richard M. Bissell, Jr. This 1961 invasion failed. Fidel Castro survived the widely-discussed assassination plots against him. But the initiative succeeded in w hat was probably its core purpose: to organize a force of multi-use professional assassin s. The Florida-trained killers stayed in business unde r the leadership of Ted Shackley. They were all around the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963. They kept going with the Operation Phoenix mass murder of Vietnames e civilians, with Middle East drug and terrorist programs, and with George Bush's Contra wars in Central America. • Harvey Hollister Bundy (S&B 1909) was Henry L. Stim son's Assistant Secretary of State (1931-33); then he was Stimson's Special A ssistant Secretary of War, alongside Assistant Secretary Robert Lovett of Skull and Bones and Brown Brothers Harriman. Harvey's son William P. Bundy (S&B 1939) was a CIA off icer from 1951 to 1961; as a 1960s defense official, he pushed the Harriman -Dulles scheme for a Vietnam war. Harvey's other son, McGeorge Bundy (S&B 1940), co-aut hored Stimson's memoirs in 1948. As President John Kennedy's Director of Natio nal Security, McGeorge Bundy organized the whitewash of the Kennedy assassinatio n, and immediately switched the U.S. policy away from the Kennedy pullout and back toward war in Vietnam. • There was also Henry Luce, a Bonesman of 1920 with David S. Ingalls and Harry Pomeroy. Luce published Time magazine, where his ir onically-named \"American Century\" 319"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY blustering was straight British Empire doctrine: Bury the republics, hail the Anglo-Saxon conquerors. • William Sloane Coffin, tapped for 1949 Skull and Bo nes by George Bush and his Bone companions, was from a long line of Skull and Bo nes Coffins. William Sloane Cof- fin was famous in the Vietnam War protest days as a leader of the left protest against the war. Was the fact that he was an agent of the Centra l Intelligence Agency embarrassing to William Sloane? This was no contradiction. His uncle, the Reverend H enry Sloane Coffin (S&B 1897), had also been a \"peace\" agitator, and an oligarchic al agent. Uncle Henry was for 20 years president of the Union Theological Seminary, whose board chairman was Prescott Bush's partner Thatcher Brown. In 1937, Henry Coffin and Joh n Foster Dulles led the U.S. delegation to England to found the World Council of Churches, as a \"peace movement\" guided by the pro-Hitler faction in England. The Coffins have been mainstays of the liberal death lobby, for euthanasia and eugen- ics. The Coffins outlasted Hitler, arriving into the CIA in the 1950s. • Amory Howe Bradford (S&B 1934) married Carol Warburg Rothschild in 1941. Carol's mother, Carola, was the acknowledged head of the Warburg family in America after World War II. This family had assisted the Ha rrimans' rise into the world in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; in concer t with the Sulzbergers at the New York Times, they had used their American Jewish Committee and B'nai B'rith to protect the Harriman-Bush deals with Hitler. This made it nice f or Averell Harriman, just like fam- ily, when Amory Howe Bradford worked on the Planning Group of Harriman's NATO secretariat in London, 1951-52. Bradford was meanwhi le assistant to the publisher of the New York Times, and went on to become general m anager of the Times. Other modern Bonesmen have been closely tied to Geor ge Bush's career. • George Herbert Walker, Jr. (S&B 1927) was the Presid ent's uncle and financial angel. In the 1970s he sold G.H. Walker & Co. to White, Wel d & Co. and became a director of White, Weld; company heir William Weld, the curr ent Massachusetts governor, is an active Bush Republican. • Publisher William F. Buckley (S&B 1950) had a family oil business in Mexico. There Buckley was a close ally to CIA covert operations man ager E. Howard Hunt, whose lethal antics were performed under the eyes of Miami Stati on and Jupiter Island. • David Lyle Boren (S&B 1963) was assistant to the dire ctor of the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization, and a propaganda analyst for the U.S. Information Agency, before graduating from Yale. Thus while he was imbibing th e British view at Oxford University (1963-65), Boren was already an Anglo-American intel ligence operative, listed in the \"speakers bureau\" of the American embassy in London . David Boren was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1979 and became chairman of the Sena te Intelligence Committee. Though a Democrat (who spoke knowingly of the \"para llel government\" operating in Iran-Contra), Boren's Intelligence Committee ruli ngs have been (not unexpectedly) more and more favorable to his \"Patriarch\" in the W hite House.

He 320 A"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"S KULL AND B ONES -. T HE R ACIST N IGHTMARE AT Y ALE led other raids against U.S. and Mexican forces wel l into the 1880s; he was captured and escaped many times. Geronimo was finally interned at Fort Sill, Oklahom a. He became a farmer and joined a Christian congregation. He died at the age of 79 y ears in 1909, and was buried at Fort Sill. Three-quarters of a century later, his tribes men raised the question of getting their famous warrior reinterred back in Arizona. Ned Anderson was Tribal Chairman of the San Carlos Ap ache Tribe from 1978 to 1986. This is the story he tells 8 : Around the fall of 1983, the leader of an Apache gr oup in another section of Arizona said he was interested in having the remains of Ger onimo returned to his tribe's custody. Taking up this idea, Anderson said that the remains properly belonged to his group as much as to the other Apaches. After much discussion , several Apache groups met at a kind of summit meeting held at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The army authorities were not favorable to the meeting, and it only occurred thro ugh the intervention of the office of the Governor of Oklahoma. As a result of this meeting, Ned Anderson was writt en up in the newspapers as an articulate Apache activist. Soon afterwards, in lat e 1983 or early 1984, a Skull and Bones member contacted Anderson and leaked evidence that Geronimo's remains had long ago been pilfered — by Prescott Bush, George's father. The informant said that in May of 1918, Prescott Bush and five other officers at Fort Sill d esecrated the grave of Geronimo. They took turns watching while they robbed the grave, ta king items including a skull, some other bones, a horse bit and straps. These prizes w ere taken back to the Tomb, the home of the Skull and Bones Society at Yale in New Haven , Connecticut. They were put into a display case, which members and visitors could easi ly view upon entry to the building. The informant provided Anderson with photographs of the stolen remains, and a copy of a Skull and Bones log book in which the 1918 grav e robbery had been recorded. The informant said that Skull and Bones members used th e pilfered remains in performing some of their Thursday and Sunday night rituals, wi th Geronimo's skull sitting out on a table in front of them. Outraged, Anderson traveled to New Haven. He did so me investigation on the Yale campus and held numerous discussions, to learn what the Apaches would be up against when they took action, and what type of action woul d be most fruitful. Through an attorney, Ned Anderson asked the FBI to m ove into the case. The attorney conveyed to him the Bureau's response: If he would turn over every scrap of evidence to the FBI, and completely remove himself from the c ase, they would get involved. He rejected this bargain, since it did not seem likely to lead toward recovery of Geronimo's remains. Due to his persistence, he was able to arrange a Se ptember 1986 Manhattan meeting with Jonathan Bush, George Bush's brother. Jonathan Bush vaguely assured Anderson that he would get what he had come after, and set a followup meeting for the next day. But Bush stalled — Anderson believes this was to gain time to hide and secure the stolen remains against any possible rescue action. The Skull and Bones attorney representing the Bush fa mily and managing the case was Endicott Peabody Davison. His father was the F. Trubee Davison mentioned above, who had been president of New York's American Museu m of Natural History, and per- sonnel director for the Central Intelligence Agency. The general attitude of this Museum crowd has long been that \"Natives\" should be stuffe d and mounted for display to the Fashionable Set. 321"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Finally, after about 11 days, another meeting occur red. A display case was produced, which did in fact match the one in the photograph t he informant had given to Ned Anderson. But the skull he was shown was that of a ten-year-old child, and Anderson refused to receive it or to sign a legal document p romising to shut up about the matter- Anderson took his complaint to Arizona Congressmen M orris Udahl and John Mc- Cain III, but with no results. George Bush refused Con gressman McCain's request that he meet with Anderson. Anderson wrote to Udahl, enclosing a photograph of the wall case and skull at the \"Tomb,\" showing a black and white photograph of the living Geronimo, which members of the Order had boastfully posted next to their di splay of his skull. Anderson quoted from a Skull and Bones Society internal history, en titled Continuation of the History of Our Order for the Century Celebration, 17 June 1933, by The Little Devil of D'121. From the war days [WW. I] also sprang the mad exped ition from the School of Fire at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, that brought to the T[omb] its most spectacular \"crook,\" the skull of Geronimo the terrible, the Indian Chief who had tak en forty-nine white scalps.

The ring of pick on stone and thud of earth on earth alone disturbs the peace of the prairie. An axe pried open the iro n door of the tomb, and Patriarch] Bush entered and started to dig. We dug in turn, each on relief taking a turn on the road as guards ... Finally Patriarch] Ellery James turned up a bri dle, soon a saddle horn and rotten leathers followed, then wood and then, at the exact bottom o f the small round hole, Patriarch] James dug deep and pried out the trophy itself... We quic kly closed the grave, shut the door and sped home to Patriarch] Mallon's room, where we cle aned the Bones. Patriarch] Mallon sat on the floor liberally applying carbolic acid. The Skull was fairly clean, having only some flesh inside and a little hair. I showered and hit the ha y ... a happy man ... .\" 9 The other grave robber whose name is given, Ellery James, we encountered in Chapter 1 [ George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography] — he was to be an usher at Prescott's wedding three years later. And the fellow who applied acid to the stolen skull, burning off the flesh and hair, was Neil Mallon. Years later, Prescott Bus h and his partners chose Mallon as chairman of Dresser Industries; Mallon hired Presco tt's son, George Bush, for George's first job; and George Bush named his son, Neil Mallo n Bush, after the flesh-picker. In 1988, the Washington Post ran an article, origin ating from the Establishment-line Arizona Republic, entitled \"Skull for Scandal: Did Bu sh's Father Rob Geronimo's Grave?\" The article included a small quote from the 1933 Sk ull and Bones History of Out Order. \"An axe pried open the iron door of the tomb, and . .. Bush entered and started to dig ...\" and so forth, but neglected to include other n ames beside Bush. According to the Washington Post, the document whic h Bush attorney Endicott Davison tried to get the Apache leader to sign, sti pulated that Ned Anderson agreed it would be \"inappropriate for you, me [Jonathan Bus h] or anyone in association with us to make or permit any publication in connection with this transaction.\" Anderson called the document \"very insulting to Indians.\" Da vison claimed later that the Order's own history book is a hoax, but during the negotiat ions with Anderson, Bush's attorney demanded Anderson give up his copy of the book. 10 322"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"S KULL AND B ONES -.

After e xposure of 'true facts' by Anderson, and consideration by some representatives in Congress, the issue faded from public sight.

Conspiracy t heory maintains a lack of simplicity in its theoretical explanation of histor ical events often incorporating complex explanations when other, more simplistic ex planatory models may exist. Furthermore, conspiracy theory is an unfalsifiable explanation of events. As a result, conspiracy theory has come to represen t a political other to 'proper' democratic politics through the use of pot entially illegitimate as- sumptions that seem to question that the Unites Sta tes is a benign, pluralistic democracy, and that seem to reject the popular noti on that history moves through the triumph of progress and leadership, as well as through the vagaries of coincidence and mistake. 329 T T"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY In regards to conspiratorial assumptions of illegal financing and the Order of Skull and Bones, specialists in the field of politi cal science, who are confronted by ragged evidence, are likely to insist that a sim ilar lack of uniformity and/or causation characterized financial decisions in the first half of the century, and that no conspiratorial collusion existed. To genera lize about legality and motives of early international financing is undoubtedly haz ardous, and one should be on guard against projecting bias and contemporary theo ries too far back into the past. Yet one must also be on guard against ignorin g important evidence and its implications on society at that period of time. The actual number of firms involved and level of in ternational financing to both Germany and the Soviet Union during this time period is inevitably open to dispute. Even apart from the problem of trying to e stimate the number of firms and amount of finance that went uncataloged by Sena te investigations, contem- porary evidence must be handled with caution, for i t often yields false clues to the number of firms involved and the motives of the financiers. Furthermore, drawing correlations between firms that were involv ed in illegal financing requires listing managers, presidents, vice-presidents and d irectors who might have been involved in the decision making process. Such infor mation is difficult to come by, and almost impossible to determine who was dire ctly making individual deci- sions. As a result, certain assumptions have to be made and adhered to without the benefit of supporting evidence. This is one of many reasons that social scientists discredit conspiracy theory and the issues of illeg al finance during times of war are largely ignored. Nevertheless, although it has to be considered in c onjunction with many other issues, the correlations between The Order of Skull and Bones and illegal finance certainly does deserve a closer study. One must be careful not to skew these histori- cal events with speculation and assumption. But it is equally important not to go too far in the other direction and underestimate an d/or ignore these correlations. In order to avoid this problem, a falsifiable test will be created in order to minimize problems associated with traditional conspiracy the ory and to provide a framework through which the conspiracy theory evidence can be reexamined.

Bush, as well as increased political supp ort for presidential hopeful Senator John Kerry, also a Skull and Bones member, the subject of the Order of Skull and Bones has become very popular wi th certain media outlets, as well as very marketable. Hollywood recently prod uced a movie based loosely on the Order of Skull and Bones, an investigative d ocumentary was produced for television and three books covering the subject of Skull and Bones are scheduled to be released between 2002 and 2003. Such a rapid growth in the recent attention directe d at Skull and Bones begs the question of why; why has this organization rece ived so much attention of late, and why is much of the attention focused on a llegations of conspiracy? Skull and Bones has been in existence since 1832; however , until the election of our former President and Skull and Bones member George H. W. Bush, only about half a dozen articles were written about this organ ization. So why are we seeing such recent explosive popularity and interest regar ding this subject? I propose two possibilities that tend to feed into each other compounding the underlying focus of recent attention. The first is the secrecy of this organiza- tion. Skull and Bones, whose actual name is \"The Or der 322\" or \"The Order of Skull and Bones,\" is the most prestigious and influ ential of nine secret, senior societies at Yale University. Their meetings are he ld secretly, their initiations are held secretly, and until recently their membership was kept secret. The secrecy of this society is so prevailing that a member of T he Order is allegedly required to leave the room when the subject of The Order is being discussed. As a result of this adamant secrecy, outsiders are left no opti on but to speculate about the purpose and intent of Skull and Bones. Second, the secret society of Skull and Bones is ve ry small. Membership is limited to the initiation of only 15 seniors each y ear. This fact was known at Yale since The Order's founding; however, it was kept fr om public attention until 1984 when an anonymous member of Skull and Bones provide d an author with inside information, thus allowing the author to obtain the previously secret membership list. This membership list provided the groundwork from which all speculation about the organization's goals and intentions deriv e. The small size of Skull and Bones is not at all indicative of the power and inf luence that they have had on American society in the past 150 years. As one investigative reporter so aptly claimed, \" F or two centuries, the initiation rite of Skull and Bones has shaped the c haracter of the men who have shaped the American character,\" 1 including three Presidents. This secret 331 W"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET Society society is dominated by old-line wealth and power. In Skull and Bones we find family names such as Bush, Russell, Taft, Whitney, Lord, Phelps, Wadsworth, Allen, Bundy and Adams. Other Skull and Bones famil ies that attained influ- ence during the nineteenth century include Harriman , Rockefeller, Payne and Davison. A brief list of some of the members of Sku ll and Bones during the past century better illustrates the level of wealth , power and influence this small group wields. George W. Bush ('68): President George H.W. Bush ('48): CIA, Vice Pres. (1980-88), Pres. (88-92), Zapata Oil Prescott Bush ('17): Union Banking Corporation, Bro wn Brothers, Harriman William H.

Because of the existence of a membership l ist, researchers are able to trace the activities of the members of Skull and Bones in an attempt to determine the goal of that secret society. However, instead of pr oviding answers, such research only succeeded in generating new questions, assumpt ions and speculations. Such speculation resulted in numerous conspiracy theorie s ranging from organized crime and drug trafficking to the direct manipulati on of education and brain washing of America; to the Nazi eugenics movement a nd ultimately the active creation and manipulation of war through illegal fi nance. It is the latter subject that this thesis will expl ore. The claim of active creation and manipulation of war through illegal finance was chosen because there exists 332"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OF S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE very strong and verifiable evidence documenting the illegal financing of enemy regimes by members of Skull and Bones prior to and during times of war. This evidence and the subsequent claims are signifi cant because of the positions of influence that members of Skull and Bones occupy in our government. If the members of this secret society who hold political p ositions in the government are involved in illegal activities, how will their acti ons affect the United States as a whole, as well as the creation of government polici es that those members are able to influence? Second, how does public knowledge of illegal activities by political officials affect the democratic process? The focus of this thesis then is an attempt to answer the question: Does a causal relationship exist between membership in Skull and Bones and participation in illegal financ e? But first, it would be of value to provide a brief history of the emergence and growth of conspiracy theory in general. How and whe re did conspiracy theory start? How has conspiracy theory grown, and among w hom is it most prevalent? An exploration of the emergence of conspiracy theor y will then be followed by a brief history of the \"Order of Skull and Bones.\" THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING OF CONSPIRACY THEORY _____ __ CONSPIRACY THEORY IN THE UNITED STATES has received a great deal of popu- lar attention in the past several decades. In the w ake of the cold war, with events such as the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal s till etched in the minds of millions of Americans, a strong sentiment of distru st aimed at the government arose. Groups, such as the John Birch Society, were formed for the purpose of combating the 'government conspiracy,' while numero us citizens harbor vary- ing degrees of distrust toward politics and/or feel ings of insignificance in the American political system. As Professor Mark T. Reinhardt states, \"On the one hand, conspiracy theory is often characterized as illegitimate, pathological, and a threat to political stability; on the other hand, it seems an entertaining narrati ve form, a populist expression of a democratic culture, that circulates deep skept icism about the truth of the current political order through contemporary cultur e.\" 2 Author Mark Fenster, in his book Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture, makes a powerful argument for regarding conspiracism (the b elief in conspiracy theory) as in integral product of the political system, reflec ting inadequacies the establish- ment itself is blind to and expressing strong desir es for the realization of frustrated ideals. Fenster notes that conspiracy theory serves a useful purpose as a balm to the politically alienated segments of society, and he optimistically interprets the popular pursuit of uncovering the hidden mechanics of power as evidence of a latent populism waiting to be harnessed. 3 Nevertheless, conspiracy thinking is not confined t o the marginal and politi- cally alienated segments of society as Fenster migh t imply. Rather conspiracy thinking is becoming a popular way of viewing the w orld around us. Political figures such as Joseph McCarthy and Barry Goldwater both made names for 333"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY themselves through the claims and pursuance of cons piracy within the govern- ment. Numerous movies and television shows incorpor ate the themes of govern- ment conspiracy, abuse of power and political cover -up while New York Times best selling authors such as Dean Koontz consistent ly focus attention on secret government agencies and plots. In 1996, the Gallup Organization and the Post-Moder nity Project of the University of Virginia conducted a survey concernin g American political beliefs entitled, The State of Disunion: 1996 Survey of Ame rican Political Culture. This study involved face-to-face interviews with a natio nal sampling of over 2,000 adults. Among the many findings reported in the sur vey were the following: Three out of four Americans (77 percent) agree with the statement that \"the government is pretty much run by a few big interest s looking out for them- selves. \" (Twenty-nine percent completely agree.) S imilarly, 63 percent of all Americans say that America's governing elite is \"on ly concerned about its own agenda.\" This same percentage agrees that \"our coun try is run by a close net- work of special interests, public officials, and th e media.\" (Twenty-five percent completely agree.) 4 The survey also revealed, \"one quarter of the popul ation repeatedly express the conviction that the government is run by a conspira cy, and one in ten Americans strongly subscribes to this view.\" 5 Conspiracy theory provides a framework, which for m any, helps explain much of what would otherwise seem illogical or implausib le in our contemporary society. Conspiracy theory does not question the foundations of our societal structure but rather conspiracy theory provides the ability f or people to maintain their ideological convictions while scapegoating blame on to the ruling elite. Conspiracy theory centers on the surpluses of political and ec onomic power, understanding them as integral to the maintenance of power, while attempting to discern who has the surpluses of power, how they obtained those surpluses and what they are doing with them. P OPULAR U NDERSTANDING OF C ONSPIRACY T HEORY _______________________ CONSPIRACY THEORIES were arguably a large influence on American think- ing before the Revolutionary War. It was popularize d just after World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution, asserting Communism as the manifested form of the global conspiracy, and has steadily gai ned influence and at- tention since then through its insistence on the re jection of both socialism and global governing organizations such as the Unit ed Nations. Conspiracy theory is not limited to certain segments of societ y nor is it exclusive to American culture. The predominance of conspiracy thinking is found in numerous writings, speeches and records including U.S. congressional r ecords and investigations, 334"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OF S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE and many powerful and influential people have promo ted it. For example, the California Senate Investigating Committee on Educat ion states in their 1953 report on education that, So called modern Communism is apparently the same h ypocritical and deadly world conspiracy to destroy civilization that was f ounded by the secret order of the Illuminati in Bavaria May 1, 1776. 6 Conspiracy thinking is not exclusive to American Cu lture. In a speech before the British Parliament in 1920, Winston Churchill state d, From the days of Sparticus-Weishaupt to those of Ka rl Marx,... this world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization ... ha s been steadily growing. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement du ring the Nineteenth century, and now at last this band of extraordinary personal ities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America has gripped the Russian people..? Both of these passages refer to a worldwide conspir acy originating with the \"secret order of the Illuminati of Bavaria.\" The Illuminati of Bavaria, for a vast majority of conspiracy theorists is the corner stone to underst anding the worldwide conspiracy that allegedly exists today. Conspiracy theorist Jo hn F. McManus states, \"Let us openly assert, that there is operating in t he world today, and especially within our own nation, a conspiracy that is either a direct descendant of the Illuminati of 1776 or something closely patterned a fter it. \"8 So who or what is the Illuminati of Bavaria and why is so much attention focused on this group? H ISTORICAL U NDERSTANDING OF C ONSPIRACY T HEORY _____________________ ADAM WEISHAUPT formed the \"Order of the Illuminati\" in Bavaria on May 1, 1776. The philosophy of Weishaupt's Illuminism \" propose[d] as the end of Illuminism the abolition of property, social author ity, and of nationality,\" 9 and was based primarily on revolution and secrecy as a means to bring about social change. Weishaupt's goal was the complete and revol utionary restructuring of society, and to this end Weishaupt \"felt the need o f a powerful secret organiza- tion to support him in the conflict with his advers aries and in the execution of his rationalistic schemes along ecclesiastical and political lines.\" 10 By 1778, only two years after its creation, Weishau pt was able to secure more then 1000 members for the Illuminati in Bavaria alo ne, and there were lodges in 12 other countries including France and the United States. 11 In 1784, a messenger was struck by lightning while carrying letters from Weishaupt to other members of the Illuminati. The police authorities confiscat ed these letters, which resulted 335"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY in the raid of the homes of several leading members of the Illuminati. Weishaupt's Order of the Illuminati was declared as subversive to the German government and the leaders of the Illuminati were banished fro m Germany. After the French Revolution numerous books outlinin g alleged connections between the French Jacobins and Weishaupt's Illumin ati were produced. These books focused on the many shared members between th e Illuminati and the Jacobins, showing that the leaders of the French Re volution were also high rank- ing members of the Illuminati, according the Illumi nati's records which were confiscated by the Bavarian government. Concern over the influence of the Illuminati during the French Revolution spread all over the world, including America. In a letter to Rev. G.W. Snyder dated October 24, 1798, Former President George Was hington States, Reverend sir: It was not my intention to doubt that the doctrine of the Illu- minati had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more satisfied of this fact then I am. 12 Many organizations that were allegedly involved wit h the conspiratorial Illu- minati, because of their many shared members, becam e suspect. These various groups included Eclectic Freemasonry, the German Un ion and the League of the Just. The connection between the League of the Just and the Illuminati is of significance to conspiracy theorists because it was the League of the Just who \"commissioned [Karl] Marx and [Frederick] Engel s to draw up a defini- tive statement of its aims and program.\" 13 According to J. Edgar Hoover, the League of the Just was a secret society that later became publicly known as the Communist League. Conspiracy theorists emphasize the alleged link bet ween the Illuminati of Bavaria and Communism. A comparison of the Communis t Manifesto and of the writing of Adam Weishaupt, as confiscated by the Bavarian government and later published by John Robison in 1798, show t hat the two philosophies are essentially identical in both goals and in meth odology. Other superficial evidence presented by conspiracy theorists include the Communist National holiday celebrated on May 1, the same day that the Illuminati was officially formed; the stated goal of Communism as expressed b y former Communist leaders such as Lenin, Stalin, Khrushchev and Gorba chev as being World Communism or Novus Ordo Seclorum (New World Order), is both the same goal and same terminology expressed by Adam We ishaupt; both the Illuminati and Communism were regarded by numerous political figures throughout the world as a well organized internatio nal conspiracy in pursuit of a ruinous end. Following a three year investigation of the 1886 ri ot in Chicago that resulted in the death of 7 police officers and the injury of 63 more, Police Captain Mi- chael Schaack stated, 336"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OF S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE In London there are all the factors for the most da ngerous mob the world can produce. In France, the commune is stronger than ev er it was and the Red terror may appear with every turn of the whirligig of poli tics. In Spain and Italy, the Socialists are busy while in Germany and Russia a c risis is at hand. Let none mistake either the purpose or the duration of these fanatics, nor their growing strength. This is a methodical, not a haphazard con spiracy. The ferment in Rus- sia is controlled by the same heads and the same ha nds as the activity in Chicago. There is a cold-blooded, calculating purpose behind this revolt manipulating every part of it the world over to a common and rui nous end. A majority of conspiracy theorists base their metho d of analysis of contemporary events on the assumption that Communism is still al ive and active and that it is a manifestation of Weishaupt's secret order of the Illuminati because members of the Illuminati created the Communist League and commissioned Marx and Engels to write the Communist Manifesto. As a resul t of the publication of the Illuminati's records detailing their subversive age nda, conspiracy theorists assume a long-range plan of world domination by any group that might be aligned with the original Illuminati. This basis for analysis is critical to understanding the conspiracy theorists' claims against the Order of S kull and Bones, because, as will be discussed shortly, the Order of Skull and Bones is considered to be a single lodge of the original Illuminati. But why would wealthy capitalists support or financ e communist or fascist regimes? There are three possible answers to this q uestion. The first, and most obvious, is profit. It is possible that businesses seek profits regardless of ideology. In this case, expanding business to a larger market that includes communist or fascist regimes would increase revenues and profits for the firm. Second, capitalistic industrialists might favor a degree of social contr ol and development by the govern- ment. Industrialists Henry Ford and Frederick Winsl ow Taylor, along with their revolutionary ideas on the efficiency of the indivi dual in the work place such as specialization, departmentalization, mass productio n and employee satisfaction, also favored a stronger welfare state to provide the nec essary atmosphere for maximum production. The third possibility, as expressed by conspiracy theorist Antony Sutton, claims that the eventual power structure between a communist state, a fascist state and a monopoly is essentially the same: control of production and elimination of industrial competition. Both communism and fasci sm control the means of production and the degree of competition while a mo nopoly attempts to do the same. Sutton maintains that these American capitali sts might aid these regimes in an attempt to gain favor with the regime and gain i ndustrial dominance. S KULL AND B ONES _______________________________________ W ILLIAM H UNTINGTON R USSELL AND A LPHONSO T AFT established the Order of Skull and Bones, officially called the \"Order 32 2,\" at Yale University in 1833. It was later incorporated as the Russell Trust in 1856 . It is one of nine secret societies 337"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY at Yale, and one of three senior societies that are exclusive to Yale University. Fif- teen juniors are \"tapped\" each year by the seniors to be initiated into next year's group. Each initiate is allegedly given $ 15,000 an d a grandfather clock, although no one has yet been able to discover the significan ce of the clock. The original founder of Skull and Bones, William Ru ssell, studied in Ger- many from 1831-1832. While in Germany, it is believ ed that Russell joined a secret society at the German University and was t hen given permission to start a section of that same secret society at Yale . According to information acquired from a break-in to the \"tomb\" (the Skull a nd Bones temple and meet- ing hall located on Yale's campus) in 1876, \"Bones is a section of a corps in a German University ... General Russell, its founde r, was in Germany before his Senior Year and formed a warm friendship with a leading member of a German society. He brought back with him to college , authority to found a section here.\" 15 This same break-in team, who mockingly referred to themselves as \"the Order of File and Claw,\" claimed that within the Skull and B ones Tomb was a room num- bered 322, an elaborately decorated ceremonial room furnished in red velvet with a pentagram on the wall. In the parlor next to room 3 22 the break-in group found: On the west wall, hung among other pictures, an old engraving representing an open burial vault, in which, on a stone slab, rest four human skulls, grouped about a fools cap and bells, an open book, several mathematical instruments, a beggar's scrip, and a royal crown. On the arched wall above the vault are the explanatory words, in Roman letters, \"We War De r Thor, Wer Weiser, Wer Bettler Oder, Kaiser? And below the vault is engrav ed, in German characters, the sentence: 'Ob Arm, Ob Beich, im Tode gleich. 16 The picture is accompanied by a card on which is wr itten, 'From the German section, Presented by D.C. Gilman of D. 50'. D.C. G ilman refers to Daniel Coit Gilman, initiated into the Order of Skull and Bones 1850. The two German phrases translate into \"Who was the fool, who the w ise man, beggar or king? Whether poor or rich, in death we are the same. Thi s quote, and the initiation rituals that each new member must experience are ex tremely similar to the initia- tion ceremony of the Illuminati. An expose on the i nitiation rites of Skull and Bones by reporter Ron Rosenbaum, The Last Secrets o f Skull and Bones, highlights the various initiation activities along with a comp arison of the same Illuminati ceremonies as recorded by former Illuminati member John Robison. Many con- spiracy theorists conclude that the Order of Skull and Bones is either a section of the original Illuminati or an extension thereof. Conspiracy theorists, in light of potential Illumin ati affiliation, emphasize three aspects of society in which members of Skull and Bones were profoundly influential: namely government, education and illeg al finance. It is this latter subject that will be explored to some degree in thi s work. 338"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OF S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE Given the historical framework of the Illuminati/Co mmunist long-range goal of world domination used by conspiracy theorists, a nd the possible connection between the Order of Skull and Bones and the Order of the Illuminati, it is easy to understand the concerns of conspiracy theorisrs in regard to illegal financing of enemy regimes by members of Skull and Bones. As conspiracy theorist Antony Sutton states, Revolution is always recorded as a spontaneous even t by the politically or economically deprived against an autocratic state. Never in Western textbooks will you find the evidence that revolutions need fi nance and the source of the finance in many cases traces back to Wall Street. 17 More importantly, concludes Sutton, is that members of Skull and Bones provide a large part of Wall Street's financing to revoluti onary movements. 3 — A N E VALUATION OF THE A NALYTICAL F RAMEWORK OF C ONSPIRACY T HEORY ______________________________ ONSPIRACY THEORY MAINTAINS that, in a given state, power \"is exercised from behind the scenes by a small secretive group o f private citizens who want to change the government system or put the cou ntry under the control of a world government.\" 1 These conspiratorial groups are always made up of a group of powerful and/or influential businessmen or politicians who are intent on running the world. In essence, these small, secr etive groups form a shadow government that is not elected but controls politic al decision-making not only for their own benefit but also at the detriment of the rest of society. \"In the past, the conspirators were usually said to be secret Communist sym- pathizers who were intent on bringing the United St ates under a common world government in conjunction with the Soviet Union, bu t the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 changed the focus to the United Natio ns as the likely controlling force in the 'New World Order.\" 2 However, with deterioration of Soviet econo- mies, the maintenance of Communist party leaders in positions of power and publicly popular soviet appeals for a return to Com munism, many conspiracy theorists are reverting back to claims of the \"Comm unist Threat.\" Smaller groups of conspiratorial thinkers, on the o ther hand, focus on a secret group of individuals whom, it is claimed, are locat ed in the government itself. This secretive group is held responsible for the cr eation of government organiza- tions such as the CIA, think tanks like the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission as well as the creation of wa r through both illegal finance in the corporate world and government policy-making in the political realm.

As with many theories on power politics, the focus is on a specific framework, with a tendency to disregard or downplay the importance of other factors. An understanding of the strengths and weak nesses of conspiracy theory will aid in the overall assessment of the conspirac y theory's evaluation of the claims against Skull and Bones. The advantages of conspiracy theory are threefold: 1) conspiracy theory aids in the discovery of important facts and assessing pers onal guilt; 2) it allows society to admit horrors and express indignation without re jecting the basic norms of society; 3) it acts as a scapegoat for societal fru strations. These three advantages occur simultaneously within conspiracy theory and a re inseparable. A conspiracy theory could not occur without assessing personal g uilt for a societal atrocity. The blame for that atrocity is then placed solely on th e individual and, by extension, any network or group he may be affiliated with, the reby disregarding any funda- mental flaws in the fabric of society that may cont ribute to the problem. Conspiracy theories can act as a forum through whic h members of society are able to admit horrors and express indignation about the outcomes and problems of society. However the discoveries of conspiracy theo ry are often dismissed because they are presented in a conspiracy theory framework that does not acknowledge errors in the basic norms of society, but rather sh ifts blame to clandestine net- works working behind the scenes. The result of ille gal financing then is not the result of a capitalist system which allows for prof it maximization at the expense of others, but rather illegal financing occurs because a select, secretive group chose for it to happen in order to advance their global a genda. In this way, the blame is shifted from the political structure of society to a small group who are then held responsible for all the ills of society. A conspiracy theory is a version of historical even ts that redirects an audience's anger toward a scapegoat group. The theory seeks to lay blame for a legitimate is- sue on a perceived common enemy. As with any societ al issue, there are legitimate concerns that need to be addressed. Conspiracy theo ries, however, fail to address legitimate concerns because realistic solutions are lost in the process of laying blame for the common problem on a select group. By only l aying blame for the problem, the issue becomes, in effect, a renewable source of fuel for the audience. Author Mark Fenster makes a powerful argument for r egarding conspiracism as an integral product of the political system, ref lecting the inadequacies of the establishment and expressing strong desires for the realization of frustrated ideals. 340"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OF S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE Fenster notes that conspiracy theory should be perc eived \"as an active, indeed endless, process that continually seeks, but never fully arrives at, a final interpre- tation. It displaces the citizen's desire for polit ical significance onto a signifying regime in which interpretation replaces political e ngagement. 3 Mark T. Reinhardt interprets Fenster's claims when stating, \"conspira cy theory serves a useful purpose as a balm to the politically alienated segments of society, and he optimistically interprets the popular pursuit of uncovering the hi dden mechanics of power as evidence of a latent populism waiting to be harness ed.\" 4 The political significance of conspiracy theory is its ability to represent disen- franchised segments of society through expressions of distrust toward the gov- ernment and the establishment of blame for society' s ills. The interpretation of conspiracy theory must begin with the observation t hat conspiracy theory is an attempt to apprehend the past and the present by pl acing potentially disparate events within a unifying interpretive frame. Howeve r, the process through which conspiracy theory results is very problematic. The problems of conspiracy theory can be arranged into 4 categories: 1) terminology, 2) information, 3) formulation of the argument and 4) formulation of conclusions. Each of these categories will be addressed separately so that the significance of each can be fully understood. P ROBLEMS OF C ONSPIRACY T HEORY - T ERMINOLOGY __________ THE FIRST AND MOST BASIC PROBLEM of conspiracy theo ry lies in the termi- nology and ambiguous meanings associated with the t erm \"conspiracy theory.\" A definite distinction exists between a conspiracy and a conspiracy theory. The former describes an actual instance of covert collu sion, while the latter describes something that exists only in the imagination of an observer. A conspiracy involves two or more conspirators join tly and secretly aiming to achieve a prohibited goal. Conspiracies do occur . The European powers did conspire to divide up the Middle East during World War I (the Sykes-Picot agreement); the Israelis did bomb American targets in Egypt in 1954 to put the blame on Gamal Abdel Nasser (the Lavon Affair); and the U.S. government did send arms to Iran in the mid-1980s (the Iran/contra scandal). Conspiracies subdivide into petty conspiracies, whi ch work within the existing order, and grand conspiracies, which aspire to worl d domination. The former are limited affairs that involve a handful of individua ls plotting to make money or to seize power. They aim at transferring money from one pocket to another or replacing one set of rulers with another. With some exceptions, petty conspiracies receive little attention in the media and are gener ally not referred to as a conspiracy. Rather, grand conspiracies are what conspiracy theo rists refer to when they use the term conspiracy. Larger and more vague, grand c onspiracies go beyond plots for personal gain or for power or money; they seek to destroy religion, subvert society, change the political order, and undermine truth itself. Grand conspira- cies involve not duplicitous politicians or evil me rchants but covert international movements. They capture the imagination and inflame political passion; they 341"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY are big enough to cause all the world's ills. It is important to distinguish between a petty conspiracy and a grand conspiracy during ou r evaluation of Skull and Bones activities. A conspiracy theory, on the other hand, is the unpr oven version of a conspiracy. Anyone might speculate about the odd conspiracy the ory, but the conspiracy theorist makes this a habitual practice. He discerns maligna nt forces at work wherever something displeases him; plots serve as his first method for explaining the world around him. He suspects a plot or cover-up even whe n other, less malign explana- tions better fit the facts. This preoccupation with conspiracy theories is variously called conspiracism or the conspiracy mentality. Ju st as conspiracies divide into two sorts, the petty and the grand, so do conspiracy th eories. Petty theories deal with limited aims; grand conspiracy theories involve fea rs of world domination. Grand conspiracy theories may also have local manif estations, but they invari- ably fit into a larger scheme that maintains the ul timate goal of world hegemony. Such theories have a finite history as previously i llustrated. They began during the Enlightenment in northwestern Europe, became a major factor with the French Revolution, and peaked in importance in the three decades after 1918. Grand conspiracy theories have a well-established s tructure and form. The story begins with a small group attempting to benefit its elf by clandestinely making plans to take over the government or expand its inf luence abroad. Its means can be many - propaganda, destroying a political system , controlling multinational corporations - but the immediate goal is usually ec onomic. I NFORMATION ________________________________________ GOOD RESEARCH is based on the ability to uncover ac curate information. Hy- potheses are formulated with information and histor ical events are analyzed us- ing information recovered through research. However , there are three important problems with research information that play a majo r role in conspiracy theories. First, conspiracy theories, by their very definitio n, are not provable. Incomplete and/or insufficient evidence is the primary compone nt of conspiracies, effectively moving the conspirator's claims into the world of t he uncertain and unknown. Conspiracy theories focus on relationships and even ts that are rarely covered in the media and are generally given very little attention . As a result, it is difficult to find records and information that would support a conspi racy theorist's hypotheses. The question of legitimacy also comes into play dis puting both the validity of records and/or information as well as disputing the context in which the records occurred verses the context in which it is used by conspiracy theorists. Incomplete information is often used by conspiracy theorists to paint a limited picture of events in society from which certain ass umptions must be drawn and which prescribes specific conclusions. Because caus ation is never known to con- spiracy theorists, they focus on inconclusive corre lations drawn from incomplete information. Certain assumptions must then be appli ed, generally of a secretive, collective, long-range nature, which then require c onspiratorial conclusions. The 342"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OF S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE use of conspiratorial assumptions in order to produ ce conspiratorial conclusions will become more evident as we analyze Skull and Bo nes involvement in both the Bolshevik Revolution and the rise of Hitler. Second, the excessive amount of information used by conspiracy theorists in and of itself becomes problematic. Conspiracy theor ists commonly rely on large amounts of information to prove their point. The as sumption that since there is so much information available on the subject it mus t be true is based on a com- mon fallacy of logic; resulting in the conclusion t hat the sheer enormity of printed text unquestionably makes the accusation fact, desp ite generally large amounts of irrelevant information and correlations that are unnecessarily included. Third, the majority of conspiracy theory informatio n and research is either unfalsifiable or unverifiable, or both. The strengt h and weakness of conspiracy lies at the fact that a conspiracy theory is unfals ifiable. The conspiracy theory generates a large amount of information that draws correlations and which, under certain interpretation, may point toward a specific conspiratorial explanation. However, the theory as a whole cannot be proven as a legitimate conspiracy, nor can it be proven as false, again drawing strength o n correlations. Furthermore, conspiracy theories are based on \"privileged inform ation\" provided by an insider who claims to shed light on a given conspiracy. By the very nature of the claims of an insider, there is no verifiability. Generally , an insider is alone when he at- tempts to illuminate a conspiracy, and supporting t estimony is rare. Such is the case with author Antony Sutton. He was the first non-member of Skull and Bones to allegedly obtain a membership list of Skull and Bones. According to Sutton, an insider disenchanted with t he goals of Skull and Bones gave him a membership list. Much of the completed r esearch on Skull and Bones is based on the membership list that Sutton was giv en. However, later research discovered that the membership list of Skull and Bo nes was annually printed in the annual reports of RTA (Russell Trust Associatio n) under whom Skull and Bones is formally incorporated.* If the connection between Skull and Bones and RTA was not discovered, then Sutton's list of Skull and Bones members might never have been verified. As it stands, many of Sut ton's claims, based on insider information, remain unverified. As a result, information used in conspiracy theory is almost always incomplete and inconclusive, unnecessarily excessive and unfal sifiable or unverifiable. F ORMULATION OF THE A RGUMENT ____________________________ AS OPPOSED TO A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH to analysis, th e approach and formu- lation of arguments for conspiracy theories are all too often circular, ad hoc, and biased. A circular argument is one of the most comm on fallacies for conspiracy theorists. This fallacy occurs when one tries to pr ove point A by using point B, which in turn is proved by the first point. An e xample of such an argument would be the claim that Skull and Bones is involved in a grand conspiracy. As evidence for this, theorists focus on the illegal f inancing activities of members. Editor's note: I do not know what annual reports these are. Annual state corporation filings list on ly the directors and officers."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Conspiracy theorists argue that illegal financing o f enemy regimes is a way to advance a global, conspiratorial agenda. Conspiracy theorists then claim that Skull and Bones involvement in illegal financing pr oves that Skull and Bones is involved in a Grand conspiracy. Did this circular e ndorsement prove anything about the nature of Skull and Bones? An ad hoc explanation of events occurs when the fun damental criteria for a conspiracy changes from one event to the next, afte r the fact. Conspiracy theorists examine situation 1 and determine that factors A, B and C are the fundamental factors required for a conspiracy. An examination o f situation 2 yields factors A, D and E, and not A, B and C as in situation 1. Cons piracy theorists then alter the fundamental criteria that are required for a co nspiracy theory to exist in order to include situation 2. This alteration of fundamen tal criteria occurs after the occurrence and examination of each new situation. Many social scientists would argue that the tradema rk of conspiracy theory is its lack of objectivity. It is difficult, if not im possible to find conspiracy theory literature that is not biased. Such literature is f illed with the demonization of the alleged conspiracy group, and it too often appears that the alleged conspirators become the scapegoats of societal problems. Focus i s spent on reiterating negative affiliations of individuals and negative representa tions of those affiliate groups. A great deal of emphasis is based on those groups tha t either use secrecy or which wield a great deal of power. Furthermore, all consp iracy research is presented in the conspiratorial framework, often focusing on one or two elements that fit the prescribed framework while dismissing or all togeth er ignoring information or events that do not fit the framework. F ORMULATION OF C ONCLUSIONS _________________________ THERE ARE TWO COMMON ERRORS that occur in the formu lation of conclusions of conspiracy theories. The first is a faulty concl usion that is drawn from faulty information. The second is a faulty conclusion that is based on good evidence. These errors are not exclusive to conspiracy, but r ather they are problems of any scholarly discipline. A faulty conclusion drawn from faulty information i s common with conspiracy theory for many reasons. Legitimate information on a true conspiracy will be nearly impossible to obtain. There is a lack of com plex data; as a result, conspiracy researchers are forced to draw conclusions from ver y limited information. They are given to misinterpretation of information, whic h results in the furtherance of faulty conclusions as conspiracy researchers rel y heavily on secondary sources to obtain their information. Many conspiracy resear chers focus on work already completed by others and generally fail to check the ir primary sources in order to prevent misinterpretation and/or the misquoting of primary sources. This problem is furthered by the Internet, where large amounts o f information is passed along, but very rarely provides primary documentation of c laims, which lends itself toward misunderstanding and misquoting from other s econdary sources."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OF S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE A simple key word search of Skull and Bones on the Internet will yield 100's of websites with information pertaining to Skull an d Bones. A careful study of these web pages show that they all reiterate the sa me basic information, but as the information is passed from one secondary source to the next, it loses its in- formational accuracy. Names are misused and dates a re confused. Each new site attempts to add its own information and conclusions to be passed to the next person for further evaluation and change. In the en d we are left with 100's of web sites each dedicated to Skull and Bones, each w ith its own conclusions and assumptions based on information that may have lost its original accuracy. Faulty conclusions based on good evidence can resul t from a fundamental ele- ment of any scholarly work: the assumptions of each argument. Incorrect assump- tions can misdirect and bias any research, resultin g in a logical fallacy. For example, the claim that Skull and Bones is involved in the i llegal financing of enemy regimes is based on the assumption that illegal financing i s a focus of Skull and Bones, and that its members, as a whole, are engaged in this p ractice. Evidence indicates between 25 to 30 members of Skull and Bones were involved w ith firms who provided illegal financing, over a 30-year period. Noting that durin g any given year there are about 700 members of Skull and Bones living, 25-30 member s does not seem to be an accurate representation of Skull and Bones as a who le. Further research indicates that the majority of members, during this time peri od, pursued fields in education or business, and were not involved in illegal activ ities. The above assumption that Skull and Bones is involved in illegal financing be cause a very small percentage of members are involved in such activities leads to a logical fallacy. Another basic assumption of conspiracy theorists de rives from the terminology and definition of a conspiracy. As we stated earlie r, the definition of a conspiracy is when two or more conspirators jointly and secret ly aim to achieve a prohibited goal. However, the definition used by conspiracy th eorists is slightly different. As stated by John F. McManus, a conspiracy is \"an e ndeavor engaged in secretly by two or more persons for the accomplishment of an evil goal.\" 5 From the very outset conspiracy theorists have attached specific values of good and evil to certain behaviors. No longer is a conspiracy an attempt to achieve a prohibited goal, or an act against the law, but a conspiracy becomes am biguous as it begins to include anything and anyone who might aid in the accomplish ment of an \"evil\" goal, as defined by the conspiracy theorists. The ambiguity of the conspiracy theorists' definition becomes far-reaching and too inclusive a s it begins to include any liberal or non-conservative program or behavior. Often the assumptions of conspiracy theory are not explicitly stated but implicitly assigned through the use of complex ques tions. A complex question is formed when your proposition affirms more than o ne thing, but your ques- tion allows for an answer to only one. An example o f this line of questioning would be \"how was Skull and Bones involved in illeg al financing?\" In order to answer the question, we must assume and acknowledge that Skull and Bones was involved in illegal financing without having proved that Skull and Bones was 345"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY actually involved. In this manner, conspiracy theor ists focus not on whether or not a group is involved in a conspiracy, but rather the focus is on how they are involved in a conspiracy, already assuming that a c onspiracy is occurring without proper examination and proof. C ONCLUSION ________________________________________ This section discussed the many potential flaws tha t surface when dealing with conspiracy theory: namely the lack of uniformity in definition, the inadequacy of information and the formulation of both argument an d conclusion. In order to fully understand the connection between Skull and B ones and illegal financing, I will attempt to reduce these problems by eliminat ing both the assumptions of conspiracy and the conspiratorial framework in an e ffort to create a falsifiable test. This test will be used to then assess any pos sible correlations that may exist between Skull and Bones and illegal financing. 4 — M ETHOD OF A NALYSIS ____________________________ E XPERIMENTAL T EST VS . N ON - EXPERIMENTAL T EST N ORDER TO ACCURATELY STUDY and assess correlations between membership in Skull and Bones and participation in illegal fin ancing, a reliable scientific test design must be created. Although scientific me thods are not always necessary to answer research questions, they can be very effe ctive in minimizing the biases that affect subjective opinion. Many scientific des igns rely on experimentation. Experimental designs allow researchers the ability to control one or more variables thereby eliminating potentially confoundi ng factors. Such designs are powerful because they can be effective in deter mining causal relationships between variables. However, because we are unable to control the varia bles that we are studying (membership in Skull and Bones and participation in illegal financing), we are forced to rely on a non-experimental test design. Non-expe rimental test designs do not allow for control or manipulation of variables, but rathe r strict observations are used, from which conclusions can be drawn. Non-experimental te st designs do not yield results that are as strong as those of experimental test de signs, and they generally do not establish a causal relationship between the variabl es. However, non-experimental tests are generally effective at determining correlations among variables, and continuation of the test design over a period of time dramatical ly strengthens its conclusions. There are two problems associated with non-experime ntal test designs. First the quality of information that is observed and used fo r the test could be incomplete, inaccurate or biased, which could result in unrelia ble and/or inconclusive conclu- sions. Furthermore, the information that is used in the test could be selectively chosen and biased, again resulting in unreliable an d/or inconclusive conclusions. Second, a lack of direct manipulation or control in the non-experimental de- sign can cause problems in the interpretation of re sults because the investigator might not be able to properly handle extraneous fac tors. As a result, variables 346 I"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OF S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE may become compounded and factors that are not of c oncern in the study may complicate or taint the conclusions. W HY A N ON -E XPERIMENTAL T EST D ESIGN W AS C HOSEN __________ FOR THE PURPOSE OF TESTING the relationship between membership in Skull and Bones and participation in illegal financing, a non-experimental cross-sec- tional test design will be used. This test design i s simplistic in that it \"requires nothing more than the collection of two or more mea sures on a set of subjects or social entities at one point in time and require s no treatments or manipula- tions.\" 1 The cross-sectional design can be effective in det ermining whether or not two or more variables are related. Because we w ill be unable to determine causation through a non-experimental test, the esta blishment of correlations will be the goal of our test. A cross-sectional test design is useful in this stu dy because it provides a scientific framework through which the specified events can be studied. A scientific hypothesis maintains validity when the hypothesis can be teste d and can, potentially, be falsified. On the other hand, as previously noted, conspiracy theory relies on ad hoc explana- tions, explanations that do not provide a testable hypothesis because their basic as- sumptions change with each new event in order to ma intain specific conclusions. The conspiracy theory does not provide a process for sy stematic evaluation of more then one situation. As a result, its conclusions are not generally considered scientifically valid. The cross-sectional test will provide both t estable hypotheses and a framework for systematic evaluation of the hypotheses through the studied events. A cross-sectional test design has both limitations and advantages. It does not allow us to control specific variables; as a result we ar e forced to examine historical events. Not only are we limited in how we conduct the study , but we are also limited in the information available for testing. Information pert aining to this subject is scarce and often biased in its traditional presentation by conspiracy theorists. Second, the conclusions of a cross-sectional test do not show c ausation and depending on the rigidity of the hypothesis that is used, could lend itself to misinterpretation. Third, a cross-sectional test over one period in time prod uces weak conclusions. Continu- ation of the same test is required with a large tes t sample over a long period of time in order to add strength to any conclusion produced . However, the advantages of a cross-sectional test f ar outweigh the limitations. Given a random sample, the testing of several hypot heses will not show causation but can indicate correlations between the variables. Th e test is also able to show a much broader picture of the behavior of segments of soci ety or society as a whole, thereby reducing the occurrence of sample bias. The test al so provides a means of systemati- cally testing various hypotheses in order to sustai n or disprove a given hypothesis. T HE T EST F RAMEWORK ____________________________________ THE PURPOSE of the cross-sectional test is to deter mine a relationship between membership in Skull and Bones and participation in illegal financing. The data 347"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET Society for this test will be drawn from historical records as well as research and claims made by several conspiracy theorists. The test will have two variables each specifi- cally measured. These variables will be tested agai nst five separate hypotheses in order to 1) maintain an unbiased examination of eve nts and evidence as well as 2) examine the results of a hypothesis that will be ac ceptable to both social scientists and conspiracy theorists. This test will examine il legal financing to the Bolshevik Revolution and the rise of Hitler by United States based financial firms. V ARIABLES _______________________________________________ TWO VARIABLES will be used on our cross-sectional t est design: 1) membership in Skull and Bones and 2) participation in illegal financing by a firm. M EASUREMENTS _________________________________________ MEMBERSHIP IN SKULL AND BONES will be determined th rough the membership records of Skull and Bones. Membership in Skull and Bones is only important to this study if the individual was a member of Sku ll and Bones during the time period being examined (1917-1945). A firm will be defined as a financial institution w hose primary activity is providing financing to industrial corporations or o ther entities. This definition intentionally excludes industrial and production co mpanies. A company such as Ford or GE, who participated in illegal financin g will not be included in this study because the primary activities of both Ford a nd GE are production and not financing. On the other hand, a company such as Guaranty Trust Company, whose primary objective is to provide financing to production companies, would fit the requirements. Participation in illegal financing will be determin ed when a firm participates in providing funds to a state or group against the established laws of the country where the financing took place. A firm is determined to be associated with Skull an d Bones in one or more of the following ways: if it was directly created b y members of Skull and Bones; if its president, chief executive officer, or chair man of the board is a member of Skull and Bones; or if 25 percent or more of its ma naging directors are members of Skull and Bones. Conversely, a firm is determine d to not be associated with Skull and Bones if fewer then 25 percent of its man aging directors are members of Skull and Bones, if it was not created by a memb er of Skull and Bones or if neither its president, CEO or Chairman are not memb ers of Skull and Bones. I am requiring 25 percent of a firm's directorship to be members of Skull and Bones before that firm is classified as being assoc iated with Skull and Bones in order to eliminate the effects of confounding varia bles. The variables to be studied are binary. In other wo rds, a firm either participates in illegal financing or it does not; Skull and Bone s is either present, according to the above definition, or it is not. I am not all owing for variations of illegal financing, nor am I examining intentions behind ill egal financing at this time. 348"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OE S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE Likewise, there occur variations of Skull and Bones affiliations with various firms. However, a firm will only be classified as affiliat ed with Skull and Bones if it fits the specific requirements above. The elimination of variance in variables will aid in the interpretive process. The use of a binary state of variables is intended to avoid pitfalls such as the following example: a corporate financier is a direc tor of company A and company B. He is not a member of Skull and Bones, but compa ny A is heavily dominated by Skull and Bones members. Both companies A and B are involved in illegal financing. The link between company A and company B through the mentioned financier would lead some to conclude that company B is also under the influence of Skull and Bones through the common financier. Ho wever, such a link does not indicate Skull and Bones influence over company B, and inclusion of company B as a Skull and Bones dominated firm could skew th e results of the data. P OSSIBILITY OF E RROR _____________________________________ AS WITH ALL FORMS OF MEASUREMENT, there is always s ome degree of error. Establishing membership in Skull and Bones through reference to a private membership list is subject to error because, despit e strong research supporting the validity of the membership list, Skull and Bone s is secretive about its mem- bership and no member of Skull and Bones has either confirmed or denied the accuracy of the membership list. In the case of par ticipation in illegal financing, we cannot know which directors initiated and/or wer e involved in illegal financing. We are forced to assume that all managing directors , by the very nature of their position, were aware of the illegal financing, and with at least 25 percent of the directorship consisting of members we can conclude that members of Skull and Bones had some degree of influence and/or leverage in the decisions made. E VENTS TO BE E XAMINED ___________________________________ FOR ANALYSIS I CHOSE TO EXAMINE the financing activ ities of firms during the Bolshevik Revolution (1917-1926) and the rise of Hi tler (1923-1942). I chose these two historical events because during both tim e periods the United States government had established very specific laws forbi dding financial support to the belligerent regimes by United States residents. Second, these two events occurred in a relatively close time frame and the s tructure and laws pertaining to international finance were relatively similar. T hird, these two events are the primary focus of conspiracy theorists when claiming that Skull and Bones is involved in a conspiracy The further examination of an additional historical period of conflict such as the Vietnam War or the Gulf War would add strength to the conclusions that will result from our test, however very little rese arch has been completed by conspiracy theorists or scholars in regards to pote ntially illegal financial transac- tions of US firms after World War II. Furthermore, the occurrence of changes in international law after World War II resulted in a change in both the definitions 349"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIEP . of international finance and the methods through wh ich international finance occurred. As a result, it would be very difficult t o find another situation of finance that maintained similar circumstances, laws and pub lic opinion. H YPOTHESES _________________________________________ AS PREVIOUSLY STATED, the core of the validity of s cientific test designs is a hypothesis that can be tested and potentially dispr oved. For our cross-sectional test we will propose four separate hypotheses that were derived from the con- spiracy theorists' allegations in order to determin e the existence of relationships as well as provide a testing method that may be acc epted by both social scien- tists and conspiracy theorists. Four hypotheses wil l be presented, starting with a very strict hypothesis and then loosening the restr ictions with each consecutive hypothesis. The term \"strict hypothesis\" refers to a hypothesis that has strong and clear assumptions resulting in a strong prediction of res ults. A hypothesis that is \"loose\" is one that is weak and unclear and results in weak predictions. A hypothesis that is very restrictive or strict will be more favorabl e to a social scientist's analytical framework and will be rejected by conspiracy theori sts because of its strict assump- tions, while a hypothesis that is too loose could r esult in the failure to explain the events in question. The hypothesis that will be mos t beneficial will most likely be one that falls somewhere between the very strict hypothesis and the very loose hypothesis; being strict enough to point toward imp ortant correlations without potentially ignoring other possibly significant con nections. As previously stated, the cross-sectional test has two variables: membership in Skull and Bones, and participation in illegal fi nancing. As shown by Figure 1, the presence of members of Skull and Bones is demon strated by boxes A and B, while the absence of members of Skull and Bones is demonstrated by boxes C and D. Participation in illegal financing is repres ented by boxes A and C and the absence of participation in illegal financing is re presented by boxes B and D. Each of the four falsifiable hypotheses will be presented in detail separately Each hypothesis will include requirement for falsification, the predictions of the hypothesis and the significance of each possible outcome of the hypothesis. After all four hypotheses are presented, the fal- sifiable test for event 1 (Bolshevik Revolution) an d event 2 (rise of Hitler) will be presented, followed by the results of the test in r elation to each hypothesis. THE FIRST HYPOTHESIS, the most restrictive, is the hypothesis that Skull and Bones related firms will provide illegal finance to enemy regimes while non-Skull and Bones related firms will not provide illegal fi nancing. In this hypothesis, we will predict that all of the test data will fall in to either box A or box D, will all 350 "},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OF S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE Skull and Bones related firms participating in ille gal finance and all non-Skull and Bones related firms not participating in illega l finance. The occurrence of data in boxes B and/or C will dis prove this hypothesis. Data in box B indicates that some Skull and Bones relate d firms did not participate in illegal financing, while data in box C indicates th at some non-Skull and Bones related firms did participate in illegal financing. If we were to find our data in box B, regardless of where other data falls, our hypothesis that Skull and Bones is directly related with illegal financing would be falsified, because it would indicated that membe rs of Skull and Bones were in a position to provide illegal financing but did not. If our data were to fall exclusively in boxes C and D then again the hypothesis would be disproved, however because we are examinin g the relationship between membership in Skull and Bones and participation in illegal financing, we can conclude that at least some of the data will fall i nto box A. If the data were to fall into boxes A and C, the results would also disprove the hypothesis. Although, a collection of the data falling into boxes A and C does not necessary disprove that a relationship might exist between members of Skull and Bones and involvement in illegal financing, it does demonstrate that other firms in similar positions are engaging in illegal financing; and may indicate that there a re other factors responsible for the illegal activity which does not include members hip in Skull and Bones. Hypothesis 1 will be rejected by conspiracy theoris ts because conspiracy theorists will consider the assumptions of the hypo thesis to be inaccurate. The hypothesis limits participation in illegal finance exclusively to Skull and Bones related firms while also making participation in il legal financing mandatory of Skull and Bones members. However, a falsification o f this hypothesis is useful to this study and the establishment of relationship s in that a falsification of hypothesis 1 would indicate that illegal finance is not an exclusive behavior of Skull and Bones. A falsification of hypothesis 1 al so indicates that other factors may exist that may influence a firm's decision rega rding participation in illegal financing. THE SECOND HYPOTHESIS states that the presence of S kull and Bones may or may not result in the participation in illegal fina ncing but non-Skull and Bones related firms will not participate in illegal finan cing. In hypothesis 2 we predict that the presence of Skull and Bones may or may not result in participation in illegal financing. Therefore, if hypothesis 2 is co rrect, our data will fall in boxes A, B, and D, with Skull and Bones related firms eit her participating or not par- ticipating in illegal financing while non-Skull and Bones related firms would not be participating in illegal financing. 351 "},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY This hypothesis indicates that if a rela- tionship exists between Skull and Bones and participation in illegal financing, then it would be a weak relationship and par- ticipation in illegal financing would not be a primary behavior of Skull and Bones. In other words, Skull and Bones may not be the primary motivation for participation in ille gal financing. Hypothesis 2 will be falsified if any of the data falls into box 3, i ndicating that non-Skull and Bones related firms are also participating in illegal fin ancing. Again, a falsification of hypothesis 2 indicates that illegal financing is no t an exclusive behavior of Skull and Bones and indicates that there are other factor s influencing the decision to participate in illegal financing. T HE THIRD HYPOTHESIS is that the presence of Skull and Bones will al- ways result in illegal financing while the non-presence of Skull and Bones may or may not result in illegal financ- ing. In hypothesis 3 we predict that all of our data will fall into boxes A, C and D, with Skull and Bones related firms participating in illegal financing and non-Skull and Bones related firms participating in both illegal financing and non-illegal financing. This hypothesis would indicate that a relationship did exist between Skull and Bones and participation in illegal financing bu t it would also indicate that other factors exist which are driving particip ation in illegal financing. Therefore, a relationship between Skull and Bones a nd participation in illegal financing would exist, but would be weak. This hypo thesis would be falsified if any Skull and Bones related firms did not partic ipate in illegal financing, indicating that no relationship between Skull and B ones and participation in illegal financing exists. THE FOURTH HYPOTHESIS is that all firms will partic ipate in illegal financing. In this hypothesis we predict that all of our data will fall into boxes A and C. All firms will participate in illegal financ- ing and there will be no firms that will not participate in illegal financing. This hypothesis would indicate that Skull and Bones is not a contributing factor to participation in illegal financing, but that there are other motivating factors that are enticing other segments of society to participate i n illegal financing. If data falls 352 "},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OF S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE into boxes B or C, then this hypothesis is falsifie d. A falsification of hypothesis 4 indicates participation in illegal financing is n ot a behavior of all financial firms and there must exist some separating factor t hat influences some firms to participate in illegal financing while not influenc ing other firms. T HE T EST _______________________________________________ TWO MODELS ARE BEING EXAMINED. Model 1 demonstrates financial activities of several firms during the Bolshevik revolution, w hile Model 2 demonstrates financial activities of several firms during the ri se of Hitler. Each model will be examined separately followed by a comparison of the conclusions of each model. An error in our methodological framework is that mu ch of the evidence used for observation was drawn from government records a nd from conspiracy work already completed, which also draws from government records. Consequently, the available evidence provides a very narrow sampl e, which presents two fun- damental problems. First, the sample itself is too small and lends itself toward a large deviation in results. In the observation of the Bolshevik Revolution, seven firms are a small portion of the American fin ancial community. With a sample of only seven firms, only a few of the firms would be required to both participate in illegal financing and to be involved with Skull and Bones in order for a relationship to appear to exist between the t wo. As it stands in our test, 28 percent of the firms involved in the Bolshevik revo lution were also involved in Skull and Bones. A larger sample could very well de crease that percentage and show a different relationship. Furthermore, the sample is not representative of th e society as a whole. For example, the inclusion of illegal financial assista nce to Germany by American industrialists would show more then 300 American fi rms involved in trade with Germany that aided in the development of the German war machine. Thus, il- legal financing of Germany was not an exclusive beh avior committed by a very small few. However, it is difficult to determine wh at percentage of industrialists were involved in illegal financing verses those ind ustrialists who were not without counting all industrial companies at the time, whic h would negate the purpose of using a sample. The second problem is that of sample bias. The orig inal research question of this work is based on the knowledge that some Skull and Bones dominated firms were providing illegal financing to enemy regimes. Further research indicates that there were other companies that were also invo lved in illegal financing but were not involved with Skull and Bones. However, th e inclusion of these firms in our sample negates random sampling and steers our c onclusions in a particular direction. Furthermore, a lack of sufficient resear ch in regards to those firms who did not participate in illegal financing, and more importantly, those firms who did not participate in illegal financing and who we re associated with Skull and Bones definitely lends itself toward a biased concl usion. 353"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIET : R ELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A F IRM ' S P ARTICIPATION IN I LLEGAL F INANCING AND MEMBERSHIP IN S KULL & B ONES __________________________ RESULTS - MODEL 1. In the cross-sectional analysis of a firm's participation in illegal financing and membership in Skull and Bo nes during the Bolshevik Revolution we find that just over 28 percent of our sample data (or two of the seven firms studied) fell into box A, showing that roughly 28 percent of our sample were firms that participated in illegal fina ncing and were affiliated with Skull and Bones. We also find that roughly 56 perce nt of our sample (four of the seven firms studied) participated in illegal fi nancing but were not affiliated with Skull and Bones. We also find that roughly 14 percent of our sample (one of the seven firms studied) did not participated in il- legal financing and was not affdiated with Skull and Bones. An interesting point is that there was no data for box B, representing Skull and Bones affiliated firms that did not participate in illegal financing. This result is due in part to a lack of investigation into the ca- reers of all Skull and Bones members during this time period. Rather then invest igate the careers of each member during this time period, I examined the boar d of directors of various firms to determine if there was influence by Skull and Bones, according to the previously stated definition of what Skull and Bone s influence requires. It is possible that Skull and Bones members entered vario us financial firms and did not participate in illegal financing, but our evide nce does not indicate whether this is or is not the case. Given the results of the data, model 1 disproves hy pothesis 1, hypothesis 2 and hypothesis 4. Non-Skull and Bones related firms did participate in illegal financing while some non-Skull and Bones related fi rms did not participate in illegal financing. These results indicate that part icipation in illegal financing is not an exclusive behavior of Skull and Bones. It al so indicates that there exist other factors, which motivate participation in ille gal financing. However the data does not necessarily reject hypothesis 3; that the presence of Skull and Bones will always result in illegal financing while the non-presence of Skull and Bones may or may not result in illegal financing. T he sample evidence indicates that there does exist a relationship between Skull and Bones and participation in illegal financing. However, it appears that memb ership in Skull and Bones 354 1: Chase National Bank had Percy Rockefeller, a mem ber of Skull and Bones, on the board of directors, but membership in Skull and Bon es did not make up 20 percent of the directorship. 2: the J.P.

However, there is no existing evidence to indicate that the firm of J.P.

Morgan an the affairs of Guaranty Trust Company during the Bo lshevik revolution."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OF S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE is not a driving motivation; rather there exist oth er motivating factors that encourage firms to participate in illegal financing . The data also shows that whatever external factor is motivating firms to par ticipate in illegal financing, it is not affecting all firms equally. No evidence exists to determine if there were Skull and Bones related firms that did not particip ate in illegal financing, as a result our conclusions are weakened. The objective in using a cross-sectional test was t wo-fold: First, although it is not effective in determining causation, the cros s-sectional test is able to point toward significant correlations. Second, those corr elations can then be used to provide a framework, or new perspective, through wh ich the evidence can be re-examined and bias can be reduced. On the other h and, the cross-sectional test was unable to provide us with a direct answer as to what relationship exists between membership in Skull and Bones and illegal f inancing. As a result, we will need to turn to the evidence and arguments of conspiracy theorists for further insight. The results of the cross-sectional test will aid this evaluation of evidence by forcing us to focus on specific correla tions and minimize any bias or assumptions that have traditionally accompanied such evidence. RESULTS - MODEL 2. In the cross-sectional analysis of a firm's participation in illegal financing and membership in Skull and Bones during the rise of Hit- ler, we find that 50 percent of our sample (five of the ten firms studied) were firms that participated in illegal financing and we re affiliated with Skull and Bones. We find that 40 percent of our sample (four of the ten firms studied) participated in illegal financing but were not affi liated with Skull and Bones. We also find that 10 percent of our sample (one of the ten firms studied) did not participated in illegal fi- nancing and was not affili- ated with Skull and Bones. Again there was no data for box B, representing Skull and Bones affiliated firms that did not participate in illegal financing. Given the results of the data, model 2 also disproves hypothesis 1, hypothesis 2 and hypothesis 4. Once again, non-Skull and Bones related firms did participate in illegal financing. Some non-Skull and Bones related firms did participate in il- legal financing while other 355 3-4: There may be some dispute as to whether or not Chase National Bank and Morgan and Company should be included in this box.

Disregarding the issue of intent, these companies match the definition for participation in illegal f inancing"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIEP . non-Skull and Bones related firms did not participa te in illegal financing. This model also indicates that participation in illegal financing is not an exclusive behavior of Skull and Bones, and indicates that oth er motivating factors may exist. The data of model 2 also does not necessaril y reject hypothesis 3; that the presence of Skull and Bones will always result in illegal financing while the non-presence of Skull and Bones may or may not resu lt in illegal financing. The sample evidence indicates that there does exist a relationship between Skull and Bones and participation in illegal financ ing; however, membership in Skull and Bones is not a driving motivation. The re appear to exist other motivating factors that are encouraging non-Skull a nd Bones related firms to participate in illegal financing. The data also shows that whatever external factors are motivating firms to participate in ille gal financing, they are not affecting all firms equally. The conclusions of models 1 and 2 appear almost ide ntical. Both models disproved hypotheses 1, 2 and 4 while accepting hyp othesis 3. Both models appear to confirm that a relationship does exist be tween being a member of Skull and Bones and participating in illegal financ ing; however, that relation- ship is weak. Both models indicate that Skull and B ones is not a motivating factor for participating in illegal financing but r ather other factors exist which motivate firms to participate in illegal financing. In light of the results of this test, namely: 1) a relationship does exists between being a member of Skull and Bones and participation in illegal financing, 2 ) the relationship is weak and Skull and Bones is not a motivating factor, and 3) other factors exist in society that are driving participation in illegal f inance; an examination of the evidence of illegal financing by Skull and Bones me mbers, as presented by conspiracy theorists, is necessary. The results of our cross sectional test will provid e us with a new perspective and framework through which we can reevaluate the e vidence proposed by conspiracy theorists. The goal of the cross-section al test was threefold: first, it was intended to help eliminate interpretive bias ; second, to show possible relationships between the variables, and three to p rovide a larger view of the behavior of society. The results of the cross-secti onal test will aid in the re- evaluation of the evidence as it will bring into pe rspective the behavior of the financial community during this time period as well as aid in recognizing and eliminating biased representation of information. 5 — B OLSHEVIK R EVOLUTION AND THE R ISE OF H ITLER A N EVALUATION OF EVIDENCE HE CROSS-SECTIONAL TEST completed in section four h ighlighted some very important correlations regarding Skull and Bon es and illegal financing. Nevertheless, it did not provide strong answers to our question regarding the nature of the relationship between Skull and Bones and illegal financing. A further evaluation of the evidence presented by con spiracy theorists is now 356 T"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OF S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE needed in conjunction with the results of the cross -sectional test in order to gain additional insight. Because conspiracy theorists focus on the existence of a grand conspiracy aimed at taking over the world, events such as the Bolshevik revolution and the rise of Hitler will be examined in order to see how members of Skull and Bones are allegedly advancing the grand conspiracy. The conspiracy theorists argument, as formulated by Skull and Bones research er Antony Sutton, empha- sizes the illegal financial activities of Skull and Bones members through three Skull and Bones dominated firms between the years 1 917 to 1943. These firms include W. A. Harriman and Co. (later became Brown Brothers, Harriman), Guaranty Trust Company, and the Union Banking Corpo ration. Additional emphasis is then placed on the corporate subsidiari es and affiliated corpora- tions of these three firms. Sutton states that both the W. A. Harriman and Co. and Guaranty Trust Company were the \"operational vehicles\" through whi ch Skull and Bones was able to concentrate its illegal financing effor ts, focusing on both the large percentage of Skull and Bones members who make up t he board of directors of each of these companies as well as the many dire ctors shared between these two companies. By extension of the W.A. Harriman & Co., the Union Banking Corporation is also included for the same reasons m entioned above as well as its unique financial agenda for which it was create d. Furthermore, according to Sutton, the goal of Skull and Bones, through its illegal financial efforts, is to advance a fina ncial domination of the world through support of fascism and communism. As explai ned in section two, conspiracy theorists believe that Skull and Bones s upports both fascist and communist regimes because both style of regime main tains a government controlled economy, which would benefit Skull and B ones firms through the elimination of competition. Yet, the financing of t hese regimes would only be a means to an end. Sutton argues that financial sup port of the extreme left (communism) and the extreme right (fascism) would c ause a popular rejection of both extremes in favor of a different form of go vernment that could both prevent and control extremist regimes. Eventually a New World Order would be adopted with the members of Skull and Bones in c ontrol. Sutton argues that this plan will be accomplished t hrough the use of the Hegelian Dialectic process, or managed conflict. Th is process involves the cre- ation of a conflict, and the control of both sides of the conflict in order to steer the conflicts resolution toward a desired goal. In the case of Skull and Bones, according to Sutton, through the financing of both Communism (thesis) and Germany's National Socialism (Antithesis), a confli ct would arise which, if controlled correctly, would result in an increased policy and public approval for the implementation of a world government. The a ssumption being that a world government would control the world's finances and would in turn be controlled by members of Skull and Bones. 357"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIEP . An illustration of the Managed Conflict process inv olving Skull and Bones and the illegal financing of the Bolshevik Revolution a nd the rise of Hitler, as proposed by Sutton, breaks down into five basic parts, as il lustrated in Figure 8. The top box indicates what the subject of the diagram is focusing on: Skull and Bones involvement in the illegal financing of enemy regimes. The diagram then splits into two columns to show the Controlled thesis on the left and the antithesis on the right. The first set of boxes indicates the two sides of the conflict that are being managed along with a general period of time. The subsequent row of boxes indicates how the thesis and antithesis are being created and managed follow ed by the third set of boxes showing the method by which Skull and Bones is atte mpting to accomplish the creation and management of the thesis and antithesi s. The final box then shows the controlled goal as a result of the management o f conflict. As was discussed in section 3, the conspiracy frame work of analysis is far too limiting and problematic. Sutton maintains that the illegal financing of enemy regimes by members of Skull and Bones \"can only be explained in the terms of the Hegelian dialectic\" 1 , process. This framework assumes that Skull and Bo nes is involved in a conspiracy of a grand nature witho ut proving that to be the case. Second, because it assumes a conspiracy is at work, it eliminates other possibili- ties that might explain the situation. Using the re sults of the cross-sectional test performed in section 4 as a framework, a new analys is of the claims against Skull and Bones must be conducted. The evidence that will be examined in the following pages is in no way an exhaustive study of illegal financing activities du ring the Bolshevik Revolution or the rise of Hitler. Instead, we will focus our a ttention on the evidence that is presented by conspiracy theorists against Skull and Bones in an attempt to better explain the events in question as well as to draw f urther insights as to the correct nature of the relationship between Skull and Bones and illegal financing by using the results of the cross-sectional test. To begin this analysis of evidence, we will start w ith an examination of the Guaranty Trust Company and Brown Brothers, Harriman (formerly W.A. Har- riman & Co.) in order to explain why conspiracy the orists focus so heavily on the activities of these two companies, and why thes e companies were labeled as affiliated with Skull and Bones in the cross-sectio nal test. The activities of these companies and their subsidiaries will then be prese nted for evaluation starting with the illegal financing during the Bolshevik Rev olution and then followed by the activities of these firms during the rise of Hi tler, in order to show that the 358 "},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OF S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE aid of these companies was critical to the developm ent and/or maintenance of Soviet communism and German fascism. In addition to following these three companies, we will also follow the activi- ties of specific members of Skull and Bones through their involvement with the above-mentioned firms. This work will examine the a ctivities of Averell Harri- man ('13), Prescott Bush ('17), Roland Harriman ('1 7), Ray Morris ('01) and George H. Walker, highlighting their illegal activi ties through these firms and their subsidiaries. For simplicity, and in order to accurately present the correlations stressed by conspiracy theorists, members of Skull and Bones wi ll be indicated by including the year of their initiation into the Order of Skull an d Bones next to their name. G UARANTY T RUST C OMPANY ________________________________ G UARANTY T RUST C OMPANY WAS FOUNDED IN 1864 in New York. It grew rap- i dly by the absorbing other banks and trust companie s including the Morton Trust Company, the Standard Trust Company, and the Nation al Bank of Commerce. Guaranty Trust Company became a subsidiary of the J .P. Morgan firm in 1912 when the Harriman family sold 8,000 shares of 20,00 0 total outstanding shares to J.P. Morgan, and has been known as Morgan-Guaranty Company since 1954. The original capital for Guaranty Trust came from t he Whitney, Rockefeller, Harriman and Vanderbilt family, all of which are re presented in The Order of Skull and Bones, and on the Board of Guaranty Trust throughout the time period being discussed. Directors of Guaranty Trust Compan y during this time frame, who were also members of Skull and Bones, include: Membership in The Order Of Skull and Bones and Guar anty Trust Company: * indicates directorship in both W.A.

This firm was classified as affiliated with Skull and Bones because this firm: 1) was created by Skull and Bones members, 2) the Vice-President of the Firm was a member of Skull and Bones during the tim e period discussed, and 3) more then 25 percent of the firms directors were me mbers of Skull and Bones.

Furthermore, this firm was also dominated and substantially owned by members of the Order of Skull and Bones.

Harriman & Co. and Guara nty Trust Company which benefited the Soviet regime during and follow ing the Bolshevik Revolution. Special emphasis is placed on those industrial comp anies that were controlled by these two firms, namely the International Barnsdall Corporation, the Georgian Manganese Company, which provided the technology an d equipment needed for industrial production in the Soviet Union, and the USSR's first national bank, Ruskombank, which provided a means by which t he Soviet regime could establish credit with the United States. Conspiracy theorists also draw attention to the anti-communist activities conducted by these companies domestically as evidence of the Hegelian managed conflict process.

Brush, one of the very few directors of W.A. Harriman & Co. who was not a member ofThe Order of Skull and B ones. It is argued that Skull and Bones had a significant hold and influence on t he affairs of the International Barnsdall Corporation through its strong representa tion in three of the four compa- nies owning the International Barnsdall Corporation . Nevertheless, evidence tends to ignore the other major firms involved in this tr ansaction. Conspiracy theorists argue that members of Skull and Bones, through the WA. Harriman & Co. and Guaranty Trust Company, were able to use the Intern ational Barnsdall Corporation in order to aid in the development of communism (th e Hegelian thesis.) We shall see similar behavior with the Georgian Manganese Co mpany. G EORGIAN M ANGANESE C OMPANY __________________________ W. A VERELL H ARRIMAN , WITH M ATTHEW C. B RUSH as Chairman, formed the Georgian Manganese Company in 1923. On July 12 th , 1925, a concession agreement was made between the W. A. Harriman & Co. of New York and the USSR to provide loans and foreign exchange for the purpose of exploitation of the Chiaturi manganese deposits and extensive intro duction of modern mining and transportation methods. 6 Under this agreement $4 million was spent on mechanizing the mines and converting them from hand to mechanical operation, including the production of a railroad system, an a erial tramway for the transfer of manganese ore and loading elevators. On August 10, 1920, the U.S. State Department adopt ed the policy of un- recognition to be the official U.S. policy toward t he Soviet Union. 7 This policy prevented the extension of credit to the Soviet Uni on and permitted only pre- approved trading. This policy was in effect until P resident Roosevelt took office in 1933. The activities of both the International B arnsdall Corporation and the Georgian Manganese Company in the years of 1921-22 and 1925 respectively, were not approved by the U.S. government and were i n direct violation of the State Department's prohibition.

G UARANTY T RUST C OMPANY AND R USKOMBANK __________________________ IT IS ARGUED THAT MEMBERS OF SKULL AND BONES were n ot only providing technology and equipment to the Soviet Union, but t hey were involved in the creation of a bank that would allow Credit to the S oviet Union. In 1920 the Anglo-Russian Chamber of Commerce was created to pr omote trade with Russia. The Chairman of its Executive Committee was Skull a nd Bones member Samuel R. Bertron('85), a Vice President of Guaranty Trust Company. In a letter from the Anglo-Russian Chamber of Commerce to the State Department, dated July 1, 1921, requests, \"What date trading in Russian cr edits was prohibited in the United States by Federal Authorities?\" 8 Despite knowledge of Guaranty Trust Company's Vice- President Samuel Ber- tron('85) that trading and banking with the Soviet Union was deemed illegal by the State Department, Guaranty Trust Company initia ted trade with the Soviet Union against State Department regulations. Guarant y Trust Company, in associa- tion with several German, Swedish and British banke rs, formed a joint banking agreement with the Soviets in the fall of 1922. Rus kombank (Foreign Commercial Bank or the Bank of Foreign Commerce) became the fi rst Soviet commercial bank, and was headed by Olof Aschberg. 9 A Vice-President of Guaranty Trust Company was installed as the first VP of Ruskombank in char ge of its foreign operations. 10 Guaranty Trust Company came to represent Ruskombank the in the US. The objectives of Ruskombank \"were to raise short-t erm loans in foreign countries, to introduce foreign capital into the So viet Union, and generally to facilitate Russian overseas trade.\" 11 At the opening of the bank, Olof Aschberg commented, \"The new bank will look after the purcha sing of machinery and raw material from England and the United States and will give guarantees for the completion of contracts.\" 12 Conspiracy theorists point toward the illegal finan cing that was provided by U.S. firms as evidence of a conspiracy, as well as the joint directorship of these firms by Skull and Bones members such as Averell Ha rriman as proof of collusion. There is a link between membership in Skull and Bon es and directorship in both W.A. Harriman & Co. and Guaranty Trust Company.

Harriman & Co. and Guaranty Trust Company, as well as both s ubsidiaries. A broader view of society shows that during this ti me period the Soviet gov- ernment had enacted their New Economic Program (NEP ). The NEP promised a reform of Communist policies and cooperation with capitalist business and resulted in a massive infusion of financial and tec hnological aid from numer- ous countries. Although the U.S. State Department r efused to acknowledge the new Soviet government and deemed trade with the USS R illegal, numerous American companies, both industrial and financial, provided aid to the USSR during the NEP. As the results of the cross-sectional test indicate d, a broader view of society does show similar illegal involvement by non-Skull and B ones related firms. Conspiracy theorists who emphasize Skull and Bones involvement in illegal financing rarely evaluate the illegal financing of other firms and t heir subsidiaries. A few of these non-Skull and Bones related firms that were involve d in illegal financing include National City Bank who was involved in illegal fina ncing before WWI as well as after the Bolshevik Revolution, the Chase Nation al Bank who was involved in illegal financing during WWI, Kuhn, Loeb and Com pany who was involved in illegal financing before and during WWI as well as post Bolshevik Revolu- tion, and the Mechanics and Metals National Bank wh o was also involved in illegal financing before and during WWI. Important production companies and industrialist who received financing from the above -mentioned firms, and who also aided in the industrial development of the Sov iet Union include the Daniel Williard of Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, Westinghouse Air Brake Company, General Electric, Henry Ford and the Vacuum Oil Com pany. R ISE OF H ITLER ______________________________________ IN ORDER FOR THE HEGELIAN MANAGED CONFLICT process to work, an an- tithesis is required. Hitler's fascist NAZI party b ecame the antithesis, according to Sutton, and as a result became the benefactor of heavy financing and aid from members of Skull and Bones. Brown Brothers Harriman (formerly W.A. Harri- man & Co.) headed by Averell Harriman ('13), the Su llivan and Cromwell Law Firm headed by John Foster Dulles, and the Union Ba nking Corporation (UBC) headed by Roland Harriman ('17) and Prescott Bush ( '17), came to represent the entire business interests of the NAZI cartels i n the U.S. before and dur- ing World War II. 13 On October 1942, the U.S. government charged Presc ott Bush ('17) with running NAZI front groups in the Un ited States. Under the Trading with the Enemy Act, all the shares of the U nion Banking Corporation were seized, including those held by Prescott Bush ('17), W. Averell Harriman ('13) and Roland Harriman ('17) as being, in effect , held for enemy nationals. The Union Banking Corporation was an affiliate of B rown Brothers, Harriman (formerly W.A.

The government later went after the Harriman Fifteen Holding Company (wh ich was shared by Prescott Bush, his father-in-law George Herbert Walker and t he Harriman brothers), the Hamburg-Amerika Line, and the Silesian-American Corporation. The U.S. government found that huge sections of the UBC Empi re was operated on behalf of Nazi Germany and had greatly assisted the German war effort. By determining that Prescott Bush ('17), Roland Har riman ('17), George Her- bert Walker and other directors of Union Banking Co rp. were legally front men for the Nazis, a host of business networks for the build-up of Germany emerged. In light of the results of the cross-sectional anal ysis we will re-analyze the Union Banking Corporation's role in financing Germany dur ing the rise of Hitler, to determine whether or not illegal support for a viol ent regime was intentional as well as what role members of Skull & Bones played i n these activities. Again, the evidence presented here is not a compreh ensive examination of the available evidence nor is it a comprehensive presen tation of the argument against Skull and Bones, however it is more then sufficient to show the connections and relationships between firms in an attempt to show t he intent of each firm. U NION B ANKING C ORPORATION ______________________________ CONSPIRACY THEORISTS CLAIM that Averell Harriman('1 3) began plans to take advantage of the economic crisis in Germany du ring the post-World War I period, starting in the early 1920s. Government i nvestigators reported that \"W. Averell Harriman was in Europe sometime prior t o 1924 and at that time became acquainted with Fritz Thyssen, the German in dustrialist.\" During this time Harriman and Thyssen agreed to set up a bank f or Thyssen in New York. \"Certain of Harriman's associates would serve as di rectors...\" while Thyssen's agent \"HJ. Kouwenhoven ... came to the United State s ... prior to 1924 for conferences with the Harriman Company in this conne ction.\" 14 The Union Banking Corporation was formally establis hed in 1924 as a unit of the Manhattan offices of W.A. Harriman & Co., in terlocking with the Thys- sen-owned bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart (BHS) in the Netherlands. Thus by personal agreement between Averell Harriman and Fritz Thyssen in 1922, W.A. Harriman and Co., through the Union Banking Co rporation, would be transferring funds back and forth between New York and the Thyssen interests in Germany by way of BHS in the Netherlands. By fro nting $400,000 during the upstart, W.A. Harriman and company became joint owner and manager of Thyssen's banking operations in the U.S., the UBC. 15 Government investiga- tors concluded \"the Union Banking Corporation has s ince its inception handled funds chiefly supplied to it through the Dutch bank by the Thyssen interests for American investment.\" 16 365"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY An article in the Herald Tribune on July 31, 1941 d eclared that while the majority of Thyssen's interest within the United St ates had been frozen, the Union Banking Corp was currently holding $3 million for Thyssen. 17 This article launched an investigation by the U.S. government's Justice Department, and on October 20, 1942 the U.S. government, under the tra ding with the Enemy Act, seized the assets of the Union Banking Corporation including stock shares, all of which were owned by E. Roland Harriman, Prescott Bu sh, three Nazi executives and two associates of Bush. 18 The list of Directors and their affiliations at the time of seizure are important in order to understand the aid that the UBC provide d to the Nazi movement in Germany. These directors and their affiliations are : E. Roland Harriman - 3991 shares [Chairman and director of Union Banking Corp.

The U.S. based UBC became the pivotal component of US aid to Germany prior to and during the war. G ERMAN S TEEL T RUST _____________________________________ THE 1942 US GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIVE REPORT states that the UBC was an interlocking concern with the Vereinigte Stahlwerke (United Steel Works Corpora- tion or German Steel Trust.) 21 The UBC began making financial arrangements for the German Steel Trust and its co-owner, Friedr ich Flick, before 1926. 22 Flick was the major co-owner of the German Steel Trust wi th Fritz Thyssen. At the wartime tribunal at Nuremberg, the US government sa id that Flick was \"one of the leading financiers and industrialist who from 1 932 contributed large sums to the Nazi party [and] to the SS.\" 23 After the war, a Congressional investigation examin ed the Thyssen interests in relation with the UBC (The UBC was also the New Yor k office for the German Steel Trust) and other Nazi entities, and determine d that the Vereinigte Stahlwerke (German Steel Trust) had produced the following app roximate proportions of total German national output as of 1938: 50.8% of Germany's pig iron 41.4% of Germany's universal plat 36.0% of Germany's heavy plate 38.5% of Germany's galvanized sheet 45.5% of Germany's pipes and tubes 22.1% of Germany's wire 35.0% of Germany's explosives 24 The major co-owners of the Germany Steel Trust were Fritz Thyssen and Friedrich Flick. Both of these men were long-time supporters of the Nazi movement in Germany and were held on trial after the war for th eir financial and industrial support to Germany during the War. Fritz Thyssen told Allied interrogators after the w ar that he provided financing to the Nazi party in several different ways. Arrang ements were made with Hitler's deputy Rudolph Hess to received credit with the Dut ch bank in Rotterdam, the Bank Handel und Schiff (i.e. Bank voor Handel e n Scheepvaart (BHS), the UBC affiliate bank). 25 Thyssen also donated large sums of money for the m ain- tenance of Hitler's private armies: the Schutzstaff el (S.S. or Black Shirts) and the 367"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Sturmabteilung (S.A., Brown Shirts). 26 Flick also, since 1932, donated large sums to the Nazi party and was a member of the infamous \"Circle of Friends\" who contributed large sums to the maintenance of the S. S. 27 For the role he played in the buildup of Hitler's army, Flick was condemne d to seven years in prison at the Nuremberg trials. The 1929-31 economic collapse bankrupted the German Steel Trust and the German government took over the Trust's stock share s. Konrad Adenauer and interest associated with the anti-Nazi Catholic Cen ter Party attempted to ac- quire the shares. However, the UBC, with the help o f British financier Montagu Norman, made the financial arrangements that guaran teed Fritz Thyssen would regain control over the shares and the Trust. 28 S ILESIAN -A MERICA C ORPORATION ___________________________ T HE S ILESIAN -A MERICA C ORPORATION WAS FOUNDED IN 1926 by Herbert Walker at the same time as the German Steel Trust, and was held as a unit of the Harriman Fifteen Corporation. The Harriman Fift een Corporation consisted entirely of George Walker as president, and Prescot t Bush ('17) and Averell Har- riman ('13) as the sole directors of the corporatio n. At the time of the merger of WA. Harriman & Co. and Brown Brothers in 1931, T he Harriman Fifteen Corporation held a substantial stake in the Silesia n Holding Co., which resulted in Averell Harriman's Chairmanship of the Consolida ted Silesian Steel Corpora- tion, with the Harriman Fifteen Corporation owning one-third of a complex of steel-making, coal-mining and zinc-mining activitie s in Germany and Poland, while Friedrich Flick owned the majority of the oth er two-thirds. 29 A director of the Silesian-America Corporation was Ray Morris ('0 1), a partner of Prescott Bush ('17) and the Harrimans at both The UBC and Brown B rothers, Harriman. An investigative report of the Silesian-American Co rporation determined the \"NATURE OF BUSINESS: The subject corporation is an American holding company for German and Polish subsidiaries, which o wn large and valuable coal and zinc mines in Silesia, Poland and Germany. Since September 1929 these properties have been in the possession of and have been operated by the German government and have undoubtedly been of cons iderable assistance to that country in its war effort.\" 30 H AMBURG -A MERIKA L INE _________________________________ IN 1920 HERBERT WALKER, AS PRESIDENT of the W A. Ha rriman and Co., arranged the necessary credits to take control of the Hambur g-Amerika Line. Walker then organized the American Ship and Commerce Corp. as a unit of the WA. Harriman and Co., with contractual power over Hamburg-Amerik a's affairs. 31 The Bush-Har- riman shares in American Ship and Commerce Corp. we re held by the Harriman Fifteen Corp., which was run by Prescott Bush ('17) and Herbert Walker. 32 Directors of the Hamburg-Amerika Line included Baro n Rudolph von Schro- eder and Albert Voegler: Voegler was the chief exec utive of the German Steel 368"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OF S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE Trust associated with the UBC and a director of the BHS Bank in Rotterdam which was also the Dutch bank affiliated with the U BC. Voegler donated heav- ily to the Nazi party between 1930-1933 and helped to organize the Nazi leap into national power. 33 The Hamburg-Amerika Line was not only involved in t he buildup of Hitler's army, but was an active agent in the promotion and arming of Hitlers Nazi party. Before Hitler's accession to power, his private arm y of an estimated 300,000 men raised concern with Germany's established governmen t, which moved to defend national freedom by ordering the Nazi party's priva te armies to be disbanded. The U.S. Embassy reported that the Hamburg-Amerika Line was purchasing and distributing propaganda attacks against the German government for attempting to disband Hitler's forces. 34 Furthermore, the Hamburg-Amerika Line and its affil iates were being used to ship American weapons to Germany. A key figure in t hese activities was Samuel Pryor. Pryor was a founding director of both the UB C and the American Ship and Commerce Corp. with Herbert Walker and Averell Harr iman. Pryor was also the executive committee chairman of Remington Arms. 35 A US Senate investigation on arms trafficking began after Remington contracte d to supply the German firm I.G. Farben with explosives. The Senators found tha t, German political associations, like the Nazi and ot hers, are nearly all armed with American ... guns ... Arms of all kinds coming from America are transshipped in the Scheldt to river barges bef ore the vessels arrive in Antwerp. They then can be carried through Holland w ithout police inspec- tion or interference. The Hitlerists (sic) and Comm unists are presumed to get arms in this manner. The principal arms comi ng from America are Thompson submachine guns and revolvers. The number is great. 36 On September 5, 1933, under official Nazi supervisi on, the Hamburg Amerika Line (Hapag) and the North German Lloyd Company mer ged. On November 4, 1933, Prescott Bush, through the American Ship and Commerce Corp, person- ally chose Christian J. Beck to be the manager of f reight and operations in North America for the new joint Nazi shipping lines (Hapa g-Lloyd). 37 According to testimony of officials of the companie s before Congress in 1934, a supervisor from the Nazi Labor Front rode with ev ery ship of the Hapag-Lloyd line; employees of the New York offices were direct ly organized into the Nazi Labor Front organization; Hamburg-Amerika provided free passage to individuals going abroad for Nazi propaganda purposes; and the line subsidized pro-Nazi newspapers in the USA, as it had done in Germany ag ainst the constitutional government. 38 Two months before the seizure of the UBC, the US go vernment ordered the seizure of all property of the Hamburg-Amerika Line and the North German Lloyd Company under the Trading with the Enemy Act. The investigators noted 369"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY in the pre-seizure report that Christian J. Beck wa s still acting as an attorney representing the Nazi firm. 39 As is argued by Sutton and other conspiracy theoris ts, the Guaranty Trust Company and the W.A. Harriman & Co. were both invol ved in illegal financial activities, which resulted in the economic and indu strial build-up of the Soviet Union and Hitler's army. However, the conspiracy th eorists conclude that because a large percentage of these firms are made up of Sk ull and Bones members, Skull and Bones must then be involved in a conspiracy. An examination of other com- panies who received financing from these firms migh t show that the majority of companies aided by either the Guaranty Trust Compan y and the W.A. Harriman & Co. were not involved in the build-up of Hitler's Nazi party. However, this information is not available. Second, it is difficult to determine how much of th e decision making was done by members of Skull and Bones verses non-member par tners and directors. As was indicated in the presented evidence, many of th e managers and presidents of subsidiary companies were not members of Skull a nd Bones, and it was these latter companies that were providing the material b uild-up of Germany and the Soviet Union. Furthermore, it might be erroneous to argue that be cause members of Skull and Bones were involved in illegal financing that i t is a behavior of the Skull and Bones group. Conspiracy theorists, despite showing individual guilt, have largely failed to provide proof that causation exists betwe en being a member of Skull and Bones and participating in illegal financing. Throughout all the evidence, we not only find W.A. Harriman & Co. and Guaranty Trust Company with all its subsidiaries, b ut more importantly we find five individuals at the head of all these affairs. The presence of Skull and Bones members Averell Harriman ('13), Prescott Bush ('17) , Roland Harriman ('17), Ray Morris ('01) and non-member George H. Walker. M any of these members were involved in the creation of the majority of th e above-mentioned firms. This evidence demonstrates the personal blame for i llegal financing on the five above-mentioned individuals, at the very least. It also demonstrates important family correlations such as Averell and brother Rol and Harriman or Prescott Bush and father-in-law George H. Walker. Furthermore, al though George H. Walker was not a member of Skull and Bones, his progeny we re initiated, along with the progeny of the other four financiers. The evide nce also indicates that illegal financing is not an exclusive behavior of members o f Skull and Bones, but rather many firms were engaged in such practices. 6 — C ONCLUSION ____________________________________ HE FALSIFIABLE TEST conducted in section four yield ed three important results. First, a relationship between being a memb er of Skull and Bones and participation in illegal financing did appear t o exist. Despite the behavior of non-Skull and Bones related firms, our evidence indicated that all members 370 T"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OE S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE of Skull and Bones who were in a position that allo wed them to provide illegal financing did so. Second, the existence of many non -Skull and Bones related firms who were also providing illegal financing ind icates that the relationship between being a member of Skull and Bones and parti cipation in illegal financing may be spurious, and membership in Skull and Bones does not appear to be a motivating factor in the participation of ille gal financing. Third, the participation of non-Skull and Bones related firms in illegal financing indicates that other factors exist in society that are acting as the motivating force behind illegal finance. R ESULTS OF THE EXAMINATION OF EVIDENCE ___________________ AN EXAMINATION OF THE EVIDENCE USED BY CONSPIRACY THEORI STS against Skull and Bones during both the Bolshevik Revolutio n and the rise of Hitler was enlightening for three reasons: it assessed persona l blame, it presented a broader view of society, and it highlighted important famil y connections that were not discernible in the falsifiable test. The presentation of evidence in both cases showed c learly a number of com- panies that acted illegally during this time period . In some instances the evidence was as able to indicate individual guilt and intent , although evidence for the latter is generally incomplete and circumstantial. The ass essment of personal guilt is important in criminal investigations. However, the assumption that a grand con- spiracy is taking place or that Skull and Bones is involved in such a conspiracy remains unproven. Using the evidence illustrated in section five, we were able to present the charges made against Skull and Bones members while at the s ame time glimpse a broader view of society during that time period. Although c onspiracy theorists tend to focus only on those firms controlled or associated with Skull and Bones members, a closer examination of society shows that several hundred firms and industrial companies illegally aided in the build-up of the So viet Union during and after the Bolshevik Revolution as well as Hitler's access ion to power. No evidence ex- ists showing correlations between being a member of Skull and Bones and these other companies who were also providing illegal fin ancing. The evidence also indicates that many of Americas largest corporation s, such as General Electric, Ford, Standard Oil and the Vacuum Oil Company parti cipated in illegal financ- ing during this time period. Participation in illegal financing by such a large group of the corporate elite indicates that other factors in society might exist that motivates firms to participate in illegal activity. The most obvious factor is the profit maximization of financial gains. These corporations were able to take advanta ge of post war Germany and Russia in an attempt to increase profits throug h the sale of products these countries desperately needed. As indicated in secti on five, several companies formed a lobbying group in an attempt to persuade c ongress to recognize the USSR and aid in the new government's development. C ertainly any financial 371"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY aid to the USSR by the US government would have end ed up in the pockets of the American businesses that were providing the USSR with technology and equipment. Other companies such as Standard Oil and W.A. Harriman & Co. were granted ownership, by the foreign country, ove r portions of the industry they were financially aiding. Another factor that might motivate firms to partici pate in illegal activity could be the desire for power. However, power seems to be directly connected to finan- cial gains. Increased profits would allow a company to gain a larger share of the industry and thus create even larger profits. The c ompany could gain stronger influence in government through increased lobbying and the creation of founda- tions and think tanks. The company could also gain stronger influence among the public through propaganda and advertising, publ ications by the company's foundations and think tanks, and through goal-speci fic grants and donations. By extension, an individual would gain these same powe rs through the company. Or more accurately, the company would act as the ve hicle through which the individual is able to gain and exercise power. Status is another factor that might motivate a firm to participate in illegal finance, although again, status is also directly re lated with financial gains as well as power. Conspiracy theorists assert that these factors are legitimate factors for explaining why so many companies were involved in illegal fina ncing. However, conspiracy theorists go one step further to argue that there e xists a few individuals who are encouraging and even organizing the activities of o thers in order to accomplish their conspiratorial goals. Examples would include the financing of dozens of industrial companies who were intent on illegally c onducting business with the USSR or Germany by W.A. Harriman & Co. and Guaranty Trust Company. Or conspiracy theorists point toward the exclusive rep resentation of American firms in their dealings with pre-World War II Germany by the Sullivan and Cromwell Law Firm headed by John Foster Dulles. These claims would suggest that the majority of bus iness is intent on profit maximization, and businesses would engage in illega l activity if there was a pos- sibility of not suffering consequences. But conspir acy theorists also suggest that there exist a few individuals who are trying to car ry out a hidden agenda. These clandestine individuals position themselves in situ ations where they are able to steer the actions of others. In such a way, these c landestine few could position themselves in the financial world and then aggressi vely aid those companies that are willing to act in a way that benefits the financier's agenda. In the same way, these conspiratorial financiers would be able to prevent companies from acting in a way that harms the agenda of the financ iers through the denial of business finance. However, proving that a select few individuals are steering the actions of oth- ers is nearly impossible as it involves proving int ent. Second, such agenda-based manipulation of the corporate world could still be explained through profit 372"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OF S KULL & Bones AND I LLEGAL F INANCE maximization, which would not necessarily require s ecrecy or a conspiracy of a grand nature. The third benefit of the examination of evidence is that it highlights important family correlations that were not discernible in th e falsifiable test. Evidence shows two strong family links that were heavily involved in illegal finance in both case studies. The Harriman family, which includes W.A. H arriman('13) and brother Roland Harriman ('17), were responsible for the cre ation of the W.A. Harriman & Co. and the Union Banking Corporation. These firm s, of which both the Harrimans were directors, were the focal points of illegal financing to the Bolshevik Revolution and the rise of Hitler. W.A. Harriman wa s also a director of Guaranty Trust Company. The second family correlation is that of Prescott B ush ('17), which includes his father-in-law George Herbert Walker. George Her bert Walker was one of the original directors of W.A. Harriman & Co.; he helpe d set up the Union Banking Corporation and later established G.H. Walker & Co. and the Harriman Fifteen Company. His son-in-law, Prescott Bush ('17) was a director of both the Union Banking Corporation and W.A. Harriman & Co. Althoug h George Herbert Walker was not a member of Skull and Bones, both hi s son and grandson were initiated into the Order of Skull and Bones. Presco tt was the first in his family to be initiated, but his son, George H.W. Bush, and grandson, George W Bush, were initiated as well as numerous relatives. There are no other prominent fam- ily connections between the members of Skull and Bo nes that participated in illegal financing. P OSSIBLE E XPLANATIONS ____________________________________ THE EVIDENCE OF ILLEGAL FINANCING could lead to num erous conclusions and explanations. The methodological framework used in section four was intended to reduce those possibilities. However, even with b oth the falsifiable test and a reevaluation of the evidence we are left with sever al possible conclusions. As previously explained, power, prestige and wealth could be the ultimate motivating factor for illegal financing, whether by members of Skull and Bones or by non-Skull and Bones related firms; however, this does not exclude occasional non-profit, agenda-based motivators. The results of the falsifiable test indicate that a weak relationship exists between being a mem ber of skull and Bones and participation in illegal financing, however a relat ionship still appears to exist. A much stronger correlation exists between being in volved in a powerful firm and participation in illegal financing. As a result , we could conclude that Skull and Bones membership appears to have nothing to do with illegal financing as a whole. However, our evidence indicates that a relationship does exist between being a member of Skull and Bones and participation in il legal financing. It is difficult to determine what that relationship is, or if our t est is accurate. Because of the small size of the test sample the results could be skewed, incorrectly indicating 373"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET Society that a relationship may exist when in reality it mi ght not. Nevertheless, for the purpose of evaluation we are going to assume that t he test sample is an accurate representation of each case study. With that assump tion, our results indicate that a relationship between the two variables exist s, but now we need to explore the possible forms the relationship between Skull a nd Bones and illegal finance might take. Conspiracy theorists claim that the relationship is direct and conspiratorial, stating that the appearance of several members of S kull and Bones indicates group collusion. Often in the arguments presented b y conspiracy theorists, no distinction is made between the organization of Skull and Bones and its members. Rather, each is generically referred to as Skull and Bones. In this way, an implicit assumption and accusation is made again st the Skull and Bones organization whenever one of its members is accused of a crime. Firms are not referred to as being dominated by members of Skull and Bones but rather the firm is referred to as being Skull and Bones domina ted. Illegal financing is not referred to as illegal financing by members of Skul l and Bones, but rather it is illegal financing by Skull and Bones. The potent ially erroneous assumption is that a direct relationship exists between the be havior of Skull and Bones members and the Skull and Bones organization itself , despite the fact that no evidence exists to prove that illegal financing is the agenda of the Skull and Bones organization. Another simple cross-sectional test might help to b ring into perspective the conspiracy theorists assumptions about the proposed Skull and Bones agenda. If illegal financing was the agenda of Skull and Bo nes, then a significant percent of the group's members should be involved in this a ctivity. Never the less, not enough significant evidence exists which would allo w us to calculate the percent- age of Skull and Bones members that were involved i n illegal financing during this time period. E XPLANATION OF R ELATIONSHIP _________________________ SO WHAT THEN IS THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP betw een Skull and Bones and illegal financing? The research indicates four possible explanations for the relationship that appears to exist: 1) positive networking, 2) agenda based networking, 3) status and 4) collective guilt of Sk ull and Bones. It could simply be a coincidence that there are so many members of Skull and Bones working together at firms where illegal finan cing is taking place; however, that seems highly unlikely. A better explanation wo uld be to examine the net- working capabilities among alumni members of Skull and Bones. Networking with alumni, and especially among fraternity pledge classes is quite common in most American universities. There is no evidence to suggest that networking was any less useful between the years of 1917 and 1943. It is reasonable to conclude that members of Skull and Bones who were interested in international finance were able to network with alumni Skull and Bones me mbers to gain access to 374"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OF S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE particular jobs, especially when members such as Av erell Harriman and Prescott Bush were so well connected in the financial world. Given the high concentration of members of Skull an d Bones found in certain firms such as W.A. Harriman & Co., or Guaranty Trus t Company, it is reason- able to conclude that some form of networking was t aking place. At this point however, the question shifts from whether or not me mbers of Skull and Bones networked with each other, to what role networking played in illegal financing, On the one hand, positive networking could have occ urred in which case mem- bers of Skull and Bones networked with each other t o gain particular positions of employment. Nothing conspiratorial would exist i n this relationship, and the existence of numerous members of Skull and Bones lo cated within a single firm where illegal finance occurs is simply coincidental . On the other hand, could agenda-based networking have occurred? More specifi cally, if deviant members of Skull and Bones wanted to engage in illegal financi ng, did they network within the membership of Skull and Bones to find other mem bers who would also be willing to engage in illegal financing? This variat ion seems plausible, and given that members of the Order of Skull and Bones are already bound by oaths of secrecy, it does not seem to be a far stretch to accept a cl aim that deviant members are able to network within the Order of Skull and Bones for deviant purposes. Regardless, there is no information as to whether o r not the many Skull and Bones members who were employed by the firms that p articipated in illegal fi- nance were actively participating in the decision m aking process to provide illegal finance. We must assume that by the very nature of their positions as directors of the company, that they were aware of such activity, but that is an assumption that remains unproven. It could be that these members of Skull and Bones networked to gain jobs with various firms but were not involv ed in illegal activity. If this is true, then the number of Skull and Bones members wh o were actively participat- ing in illegal finance would be much smaller then o riginally indicated. A third possible explanation is that the Order of S kull and Bones merely rep- resents status. Skull and Bones is the most prestig ious of the nine secret societies at Yale University. It is made up of very wealthy p restigious family names. As previously stated, Prescott Bush was the first in h is family to be initiated into the Order, but both his son and grandson were initiated ; the same is true of Averell Harriman. George H. Walker was not a member, but wa s associated in all his busi- ness ventures with prominent members. Both his son and grandson were initiated into the Order of Skull and Bones. It is plausible to conclude that there exists no relationship between being a member of Skull and Bo nes and participation in illegal financing, but rather the bonds that were establish ed between individuals such as the Harrimans, Prescott Bush and George H. Walker r esulted in the initiation of the progeny of these men into the prestigious Order of Skull and Bones. However, a very slight twist on this third conclusi on might state that the Skull and Bones organization is not, in and of itse lf, goal oriented, but rather Skull and Bones becomes the reflection of the agend a of its members during any 375"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY given time period. If members of prominent families within Skull and Bones collectively work to accomplish a given goal, how d oes that effect the Skull and Bones organization as a whole as well as the potent ial agenda of the organization? Furthermore, if the progeny of individuals who were involved in illegal financing are initiated into Skull and Bones as a status symb ol, does that not represent an implicit acceptance (or even reward) for illegal fi nancing? The fourth possible relationship is that Skull and Bones is collectively guilty of illegal financing. Our falsifiable test indicate d that the relationship between membership in Skull and Bones and illegal financing may be spurious, but it does not negate possible guilt of the Skull and Bon es organization. Conspiracy theorists have long argued that a conspiracy only r equires a few collaborative individuals in key positions to successfully accomp lish a goal. Recent events involving Enron and Arthur Anderson certainly showe d how only a few well- placed individuals were able to commit illegal fina ncial activities and hide such activities from other officers in the firm. It is p ossible that a secret agenda of Skull and Bones is illegal financing, and only cert ain members are chosen to accomplish that specific agenda while other members or kept out of the loop, or more ominously, other members are pursuing other Sk ull and Bones promoted activities. The cross-sectional test was unable to indicate if causation between member- ship in Skull and Bones and participation in illega l finance exists. The research and evidence was useful in assessing the personal g uilt of members of Skull and Bones, yet it too failed to prove causation. As a result, it is still unclear as to whether or not membership in Skull and Bones is the reason that the guilty members participated in illegal financing. P ROBLEMS WITH TEST RESULTS ____________________________ THE PURPOSE OF USING A SCIENTIFIC TEST DESIGN is to eliminate error and problems associated with bias; however, those probl ems can still occur. The primary problem associated with the test conducted in section four is that of sample size and bias. As previously stated, the sam ple for our test was very small, which leads to a larger margin of error. A sample o f 10 companies, with four of those companies affiliated with Skull and Bones, in dicates that 40 percent of the sample was associated with Skull and Bones. If the sample were to be increased to 20 firms, holding the number of Skull and Bones related firms constant, then the percentage of firms that would be associated wi th Skull and Bones would be reduced by 50 percent, indicating that only 20 perc ent of the firms were affili- ated with Skull and Bones. The purpose of a sample is to try to show an accura te representation of society as a whole. That task is difficult to do with so sm all a sample. Second, increasing our sample size by 100 percent while holding consta nt the number of firms that are affiliated with Skull and Bones shows a dramati c decrease in comparison with the rest of the sample. 376"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OF S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE Biased sampling further complicates this problem. T his study was initiated by the knowledge that some firms that were affiliat ed with Skull and Bones were also participating in illegal finance. By intention ally including those firms in our sample we begin to bias our results, especially con sidering that the sample is so small. Second, a majority of the research for this work focused on those firms that did participate in illegal finance, generally lacking sufficient research of those firms that were not participating in illegal financ e. As a result there is further biasing of the test sample. An unbiased test sample would most likely show that a great deal of firms did not participate in illega l financing. In addition, no evidence was presented that fit the requirements of box B in our testing sample: Membership in Skull and Bones a nd non-participation in illegal financing. Again, further research into tho se firms that did not participate in illegal financing might show Skull and Bones mem bers in the directorship of those firms, indicating that members of Skull an d Bones members were in a position to participate in illegal finance but did not. However, no research was completed in that area and as a result the conclusi ons from the cross-sectional test are further weakened. S OCIAL S CIENCE VS . C ONSPIRACY THEORY : P ROBLEMS WITH THE A CCEPTABILITY OF A CROSS SECTIONAL TEST _________________ THE HYPOTHESES OF THIS PARTICULAR CROSS-SECTIONAL T EST find themselves caught in much the same dilemma as any other conspi racy verses social science work; it is not accepted or supported by both socia l scientists and conspiracy theorists alike. This particular work will fall int o the favor of social scientists while conspiracy theorists might argue that by comparing large sections of society we are dismissing the potentially critical links that need to be explored between Skull and Bones and any conspiracy that may stem from it. While social scientists can argue that illegal financing may have been a behavi or practiced by several firms of influential power without the benefit of Skull and Bones membership, conspiracy theorists would counter that the activities of othe r firms does not downplay the importance of the activities of firms dominated by Skull and Bones. The difference in the interpretations of these even ts stem from the very differ- ent methodologies used in the analytical frameworks of conspiracy theorists and social scientists. These differences include the te sting of assumptions, differing definitions and induction. Social scientists rely on controlled assumptions in order to test their hypoth- eses. As stated previously in this section, scienti sts run tests by controlling certain variables while manipulating others to determine re lationships. These relationships are then tested in order to find a universality tha t holds true. As one theory is proven false, a new theory is designed from the new evidence and is then tested, and this process is repeated until the theory utter ly fails or until it cannot be proven false. On the other hand, conspiracy theoris ts tend to create theories of a grand conspiracy using the evidence of one or two situations. Then as new 377"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY situations arise, new characteristics of the conspi racy theory emerge to adapt to the new situation. As a result, a tightly construct ed universal framework for the classification of a conspiracy is not possible beca use each situation requires dif- ferent defining characteristics in order to classif y it as a conspiracy. In many ways, social scientists examine the micro e vents of particular situations in order to develop a theory that will apply to the macro level. The events of the Bolshevik revolution are examined to develop the de fining characteristics of a conspiracy and are then used and tested on other si milar historical events. On the other hand, conspiracy theorists focus on the macro level in order to interpret the micro events that take place. Because conspiracy th eorists focus on the existence of a grand conspiracy aimed at taking over the world o n the macro level, events such as the Bolshevik revolution and the rise of Hitler are then examined in order to see how the grand conspiracy is being advanced through these events. The framework of conspiracy theory and a long-range goal of world socialism and domination are used to interpret historical events, rather then us ing an accumulation of historical events to determine whether or not a conspiracy is taking place. There also exists the confusion of terminology with conspiracy and conspiracy theory. As previously stated, two forms of a conspi racy can exist. A grand con- spiracy aspires to world domination while a petty c onspiracy works within the existing order. A petty conspiracy is limited to af fairs that involve a handful of individuals plotting to make money or to seize powe r. A petty conspiracy aims at transferring money from one pocket to another or replacing one set of rulers with another. With a few possible exceptions, grand conspiracies are extremely difficult to prove, while petty conspiracies are ve ry rarely referred to as a conspiracy. When conspiracy theorists say that a conspiracy exi sts, they are referring to a grand conspiracy, and therein lies the problem. As the evidence in section five indicates, very likely a conspiracy was indeed taki ng place. Numerous companies were involved in the illegal financing of enemy reg imes against specific instruc- tions issued by the U.S. State Department. This con spiracy was of a petty nature as the seemingly obvious goal of this conspiracy wa s financial gain. If conspiracy theorists would emphasize that their evidence point s toward a petty conspiracy, it might be more acceptable to social scientists. Neve r the less, conspiracy theorists use the evidence of a petty conspiracy to point tow ard the possible existence of a grand conspiracy, which also requires the affilia tion of a secret and subversive organization such as the Order of Skull and Bones. In testing, a social scientist will often examine t he evidence of many different events in order to draw correlations and create hyp otheses. These hypotheses are tested against other events to determine if they wi ll hold up or be rejected. On the other hand, conspiracy theorists tend to create a theory, and then only use the favorable evidence of other events to prove it. As we saw in the presentation of evidence, focus is on the Skull and Bones relate d firms in order to prove that Skull and Bones is involved in a grand conspiracy. No attention is given to those companies who are involved in illegal activity and are not affiliated with Skull 378"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OF S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE and Bones, nor is there an investigation into the a ctivity's of Skull and Bones related firms that might not have participated in i llegal finance. The selective presentation of only favorable eviden ce also leads to problems of induction. Because only Skull and Bones members who are involved in illegal activity are presented, the reader is left to the c onclusion that all Skull and Bones members are involved in illegal activity. If a book were written celebrating the great amount of influence Skull and Bones members had on the American educational system, only listing those members who contributed significantly to education as well as the great percentage of members who become professors, the reader would plausibly induce from the evidence that Skull and B ones membership is focused on higher education and teaching. Again, biased rep resentation of evidence leads both the conspiracy theorists and the reader to fal lible conclusions. Never the less, the evidence presented by conspirac y theorists is valuable as it helps to assess individual guilt. Furthermore, t he scientific cross-sectional test did not produce strong conclusions, and therefore d id not necessarily negate the conspiracy theory. Rather, it helped to see thr ough the shortcomings of the conspiracy theory evidence as well as provide insig ht into important correlations that can be further evaluated in conjunction with t he evidence. The results of the cross-sectional test provided a framework that, whe n combined with the evidence and commentary, helps to better explain a larger vi ew of the situation. In order to gain additional explanations and insights into the relationship of illegal finance and membership in Skull and Bones, it would be usef ul to use the results of the cross-sectional test in conjunction with other theo ries of power politics. R EQUIREMENTS FOR A CONSPIRACY THEORY ____________________ THIS STUDY DID NOT PROVE OR DISPROVE the existence of a conspiracy in relation to Skull and Bones and illegal financing, but it did provide interesting insights into possible explanations. In order to pr ove that a conspiracy exists, very specific requirements must be met. First, the conspiracy must be jointly planned and acted upon. There must be direct collus ion between the members of the conspiracy. There is the possibility that no t all members of the conspiracy will be actively involved, but a large percentage o f the members of the conspiracy should be actively involved. Second, the conspiracy must be secret. By the very definition of a conspiracy, secrecy is required for individuals to achieve a pro- hibited goal. If the goals of the group are public knowledge and the group is still trying to accomplish them, then it cannot be classi fied as a conspiracy. Third, the goals of the conspiracy must be prohibited by law. Conspiracy theorists make a distinction here by stating that the goals of the c onspiracy must be evil, but evil is too ambiguous a term for proper evaluation. If a group of students jointly and secretly decided to earn a grade of \"A\" on their final exams, then this would not fit the requ irements of a conspiracy. If these same students jointly and secretly plotted to steal the answer key to the exams, then it would fit the requirements of conspiracy. L ikewise, if all of the members 379"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY of an extremist group such as the Ku Klux Klan bega n rallies and demonstra- tions in an attempt to segregate the community, thi s would not be classified as a conspiracy. Although there is group collusion and they are attempting to achieve a prohibited goal, there is no secrecy in t heir actions. On the other hand, the assassination of civil rights leaders during th e 1960s and 70s would fit the requirements or a conspiracy provided that more the n one person was involved in the planning of the assassination. In regards to the Order of Skull and Bones and part icipation in illegal fi- nancing, the group as a whole meets the requirement of secrecy, but there is no evidence that the Order of Skull and Bones is se cretly planning specific and illegal actions. Conspiracy theorists would need to prove that the Order of Skull and Bones is in some way promoting illegal financin g. Second, group collusion in regards to participation in illegal financing is uncertain. Collusion between certain members exists, but it is unknown as to whe ther or not that collusion is representative of the Skull and Bones organization. Third, conspiracy theorists would need to prove that the stated goals of the Or der of Skull and Bones are conspiratorial or are attempting to achieve a prohi bited goal. No such stated goal of Skull and Bones has been proven to exists (altho ugh if a conspiracy does exist then no such goal will be found.) Conspiracy theorists attempt to prove these three r equirements by first dem- onstrating a possible link between the Order of the Illuminati and the Order or Skull and Bones. Existing records do indicate that the Order of the Illuminati was involved in a conspiracy of a grand nature. Conspir acy theorists use these claims against the Illuminati along side strong similariti es between both the Illuminati and Skull and Bones in an attempt to show that these tw o organizations are really one and the same. Conspiracy theorist conclude that if the Order of Skull and Bones was originally a section of the Order of the Illumi nati then the revealed goals of the Order of the Illuminati must be the same for Or der of Skull and Bones. Conspiracy theorists do not focus on group cohesion in micro activities such as illegal finance, but rather on a cumulative cohe sion to the ultimate goals of the conspiracy. In which case, it is argued that on ly a few members need to be involved in illegal finance while other members can be involved in government, in education, in media, etc. This way, the goals of the conspiracy can be furthered through many different means all working together. This point is also consistent with the plans of the Order of the Illuminati. Finally, the general and extreme policy of secrecy by members of Skull and Bones is referred to as a fulfillment of the final requirement of secrecy. If they exist, the goals of Skull and Bones are not known by anyon e outside of the Order. It is assumed by conspiracy theorists that goals do exist and that they are conspiratorial in nature. The secrecy of the group only adds fuel to the fire of suspicion. In reality, a conspiracy theory version of history assumes a top-down, macro framework of a long-range global conspiracy, which is then used to interpret all historical events. Such a framework is required in order to arrive at the conclu- 380"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"T HE O RDER OF S KULL & B ONES AND I LLEGAL F INANCE sion of a grand conspiracy. As already stated, cons piracy theorists showed the individual guilt of members of Skull and Bones, but assessing the collective guilt of Skull and Bones is a difficult task. The burden of proof lies with the conspiracy theorists. This work has provided valuable insights into the nature of the relation- ship between membership in Skull and Bones and part icipation in illegal finance, yet that relationship remains unclear.

Then in 1864 through a bequest from Augustus Russell Street the Yale Art School and Gal- lery or Street Hall was built \"specifically at Mr. Street's direction\" on the northeast corner of Chapel & High with one entrance for New Haven citizens and one for the college. Later in the 1920's the Gallery of Fine Arts, now k nown as the Old Art Gallery was built on the northwest corner of High and Chape l Streets and an elaborate gallery bridge walkway was built over High Street c onnecting the two art build- ings. With Weir Hall on one side and later with the modernistic Yale Art Gal- lery built in 1953, the Tomb was flanked on three s ides by Yale art galleries and schools. In the 1920's there was thought of moving the museum and galleries next to the new Peabody museum on Whitney Avenue, b ut that was nixed by Street's original bequest restrictions. There have always been strong relationships in New England between the art community and secret societies. The Age of Enlighte nment, Calvinism, Spiritual Awakenings, The Revolutionary War, Millennialism and other influences had brewed an interesting social stew with the secret societ- ies, primarily Freemasonry and Phi Beta Kappa playing very visible roles. The year Skull & Bones was formed, America's first college cam- pus art gallery and the first Tomb-like building at Yale the Trumbull Gallery, was opened on October 25, 1832. John Trumbull, famous early American historic al painter, had fallen on hard times and his nephew and Yale's first science faculty member, Professor Silliman, established the gallery and arranged for him to receive an annuity in exchange for the donation of his paintings to Yale. An early design for the gallery was likened to a traditional Greek Temple. Trumbull designed the building that was finally built. The gallery contained two large windowless rooms and had an eastern entrance flanked by Doric columns and Doric pilasters. Professor Silliman was the founder and editor of th e American Journal of Science and Arts. He was a founding member of the National Academy of Sciences and a member of Phi Beta Kappa, which in 1832, in reactio n to the Ant-Masonic move- 388 "},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"T HE T OMB ment ceased being a secret society and became an op en and honorary organization. A reported reaction to the Phi Beta Kappa secrecy c hange was that Yale students William Huntington Russell and Alphonso Taft asked 13 of their classmates to form with them the Order of Scull & Bones. Phi Beta Kappa did continue also, with Russell, Taft and three other Bonesmen as memb ers. The school of chemistry, which Professor Silliman f ounded at Yale in 1847, later developed into the Sheffield Scientific School (SSS ) through which Bones was able take-over Yale. Professor Silliman retired in 1853 to be succeeded by his son, Professor Benjamin Silliman, Jr., a member of a very active group of Bones- men, the class of 1837. Junior, among other things, discovered in 1855 the process known as cracking, the distillation of paraffin, gasoline and other products from oil. As Professor Sil- liman, Jr. noted in his report: Gentlemen, it appears to me that your Company may have in their possession a raw material from which, by a simple and not expensive process, they may manufacture very valuable products. His findings spurred the first oil rush and brought Americas first oil company, The Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company of New York into the hands of New Haven investors, and made fortunes for Townsend and Bissell families , who soon had sons in the Order of Skull & Bones. The thread of the petroleum business continues through the history of Yale, the Tomb and the members of th e Order of Skull & Bones. The Tomb as first built was a nearly windowless two-story mausoleum/ Masonic hall style building. It was constructed from brownstone and is generally considered to be the work of local architect Henry Aus- tin, although officially the architect is unknown. There have been no public events held within it, so in- formation about the interior comes from reportage of various break-ins and some people with commercial access. The Order of File & Claw issued a pamphlet in 1876 on a break-in on Septembe r 29th of that year.

There were a couple of bedrooms, and there was this monumental dining room with dif- ferent rolls of Skull and Bones songs suspended from the ceiling. And there was a President Taft memorabilia room filled with flyers, posters, buttons - the whole room was like a Miss Haversham's shrine. And a big living room with a beautiful rug. And then this big, huge, expensive-l ooking ivory carving in the hallway. The whole thing was on a very medieval sca le. But it was all kind of a shambles. It looked like a boy's dorm room, like it hadn't been cleaned up in six months. There were a lot of old bones around - believe me, it could use a women's touch. \"The most shocking thing — and I say this because I do think it's sort of important — I mean, President Bush does belong to S kull and Bones, everyone knows that — there is, like a little Nazi shrine in side. One room on the second floor has a bunch of swastikas, kind of an SS macho Nazi iconography. Somebody should ask President Bush about the swastikas in th ere. I mean, I don't think he'll say they're not there. I think he'll say, 'Oh , it wasn't a big deal, it was just a little room.' Which I don't think is true and whi ch I wouldn't find terribly reassuring anyway. But I don't think he'd deny it a ltogether, because it's true. I mean, I think the Nazi stuff was no more serious th an all the bones that were around, but I still find it a little disconcerting. \" Alexandra Robbins in her book, Secrets of the Tomb adds to the public's knowledge of the interior although she dismisses the idea that the Tomb may be reached by Yale's infamous steam tun- nels — even when the subject is brought up by New Haven's finest. There are most definitely extensive tunnel and underground building complexes at Yale. Exploring the steam tunnels is still \"among the offenses that are subject to disciplinary action.\" The Yale Bulle tin The Tomb - Scribner's Magazine, April 1876 390 "},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"T HE T OMB & Calendar September 1-8, 1997 Volume 26, Number 2 reports about a $90 million \"comprehensive reconstruction\" and \"moderni zation\" of the power plants and the \"interconnecting network of underground pip es and tunnels provide steam for heating, chilled water for air conditioni ng, electricity and telecom- munication systems throughout central campus.\" From the relative positions of the power plants and Yale buildings, it is very pro bable that there is underground access to the Bones clubhouse, as claimed by the Ne w Haven police officers in Ms. Robbins' book. Just a little over a block away is the Cross Campus Library, a huge multi-sto- ried underground complex in the central campus core . Next-door just beyond the Tomb's secret courtyard wall underneath Weir Co urt is a large underground auditorium. According to Ms. Robbins there is an underground tunnel going underneath the secret courtyard garden then turn- ing north going only as far as Weir Towers. With the Order's govern- ment intelligence background, I am sure that there could be constructed an entrance into Yale's hundred-plus year old underground system with a blind alley so that those without the need to know would think that there was only passage to the basement of Weir Towers. The Tomb was first enlarged in 1883 with the addition of a large dining hall attached at a tee on the rear of the building. The dining hall is two stories with large windows. The additional building doesn't directly abut the Old Art Gallery building, built later in 1926- 27 on the south, but there is a high stonewall between the two buildings that blocks vision and movement. When the dining room addition was added, George Douglas Miller, a member from 1870, owned the sur- rounding property and \"[h]e raised a great mound of earth and surrounded the property for secrecy.\" The Order writes very little about Mr. Miller. In their catalogues all that is said is that he was an indus- trialist. George Douglas Miller also gave to the Or der one of his private islands, Deer Island, inherited from his father Samuel. 391 "},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET Society For some time George lived on the property surround ing the Tomb. His son Samuel was born in 1881 and died in 1883 on the \"pr emises.\" According to the Biographical Record of the Class of Seventy, Yale U niversity, 1870-1904, Miller had \"prepared\" for Yale at Skull & Bones co-founder, Wi lliam H. Russell's Collegiate Institute in New Haven. Miller had been in the empl oy of a New York publishing house, the secretary of the New England Car Spring Company and then he worked with the New York and Straitsville Coal and Iron Co mpany, \"a position which came to him through William Walter Phelps (S&B 1860), who had a controlling inter- est in the company. He was afterwards secretary of the New Haven Electric Light Company\" W W Phelps is a member of the Order who was involved ex- tensively in the Order's influence on Yale. George didn't reminisce about his time in New Haven , his relatives I spoke with knew nothing about his time there and written records are sketchy and sometimes contradictory. As far as I can ascertain, is that George purchased the property all around the Tomb, almost the complete b lock in the 1870s and early 1880s. There were various buildings both commercial and residential. He then proceeded to raze many of the buildings and built a flat-topped berm around the sides of the Tomb and wanted to build a college suc h as the Magadelan College at Oxford University. Evarts Tracy (S&B 1890), a me mber of the NYC architect firm, Tracy & Swartwout began building this college in 1910. The exterior of the Tomb that we see today was cons tructed in 1903. The building was reproduced, the original door was turn ed into a pair of slit windows and the doorway was put in the middle of the two. The north building is the most recent. In 1911, Alumni Hall was demolished and it's two large Gothic stone towers were brought down the street and re-erected at the northwest corner of the new addition to the Tomb. 392 "},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"T HE T OMB The old Trumbull Gallery was torn down in 1903, after having had windows put in 1868 and then serving as the central administra- tion building until demolished. John Trumbull and his wife were buried beneath their gallery in 1843. They were moved to Street Hall for a while to be fi- nally laid to rest across High Street in the basement of the Old Art Gallery, right next to the Tomb. Notably above the bridge between the two art school buildings is a \"dimensio nally correct (30 feet by 60 feet)\" windowless replica of a gallery at the Trumb ull Gallery. The cloister quadrangle that Miller began was aband oned and in 1912 was purchased by Yale. The building was finally completed in 1924 and was named Weir Hall. It was the home to the School of Architecture for many years. The building was finished using funds from Yale gradu- ate Edward S. Harkness, the son of Stephen Harkness, a Cleveland harness-maker, who was an early investor with John D. Rock- efeller and wound up as the second largest shareholder in Standard Oil. Harkness donated funds again, some sources say in 1924 others say is 1926, but nonetheless, Harkness bought the rest of the Miller property to the south of the Tomb and Yale commissioned Tracy & Swartwout to de- sign the Old Art Gallery. The original design fille d up the whole block from High to York Streets and there were designed perpendicul ar arms connecting to Weir Hall that would have completely enclosed the Tomb. This design was not built with just about half being built. This was just enough to seal off the south side of the Tomb and secret courtyard. There appears to be a vestibule at or a door into Weir Towers from the secret courtyard. Inside the court- yard there is a portico and according to reports there are some memorial benches and a statue of a knight. 393 "},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY A gate entrance to the courtyard is on the northwest corner and a high wall encompasses the courtyard com- pletely on the west side connecting again to the Old Art Gallery. At certain times of the day you may pass through the locked doors of the antechamber of Weir Hall Towers and into Weir Court. Weir Court, abut- ting on the west side the Tomb's secret courtyard 20-foot tall ivy-covered wall, was built on part of the same plateau that Miller had built up. The space is a small and usual ly private park amid the bustle of the urban campus and probably very similar to the Bones' secret courtyard on the other side of the wall. Until 1947, the Department of Architecture was housed in Weir Hall with a view of the secret courtyard, a view they kept when they moved to the top floors of the Louis Kahn designed modernistic completion of the Art Gallery over to York Street. The Tomb was n ow completely sealed behind the protective facade of the art schools. In 1963 t he architecture school moved across York Street but they \"still return to Miller 's courtyard every spring for the hopeful rituals of commencement.\" Underneath the Weir Court in 1974- 76 there was built, as already mentioned, a large auditorium. This was done without disturbing the large old elm trees. The park- like setting above-ground was restored as it was before the underground structure was built and is natural looking. Person- ally after visiting the court several times, I didn't realize that there was an underground structure at the site until reading about it later. It was not evident in casual use and perusal of the area. After the architecture school moved, Weir Hall became part of Jonathan Ed- wards College, most of the Weir Hall building becoming the college library.

What t he policy is and who owns the Towers are not completely clear. The Tomb property today is the only private propert y within the blocks from High to York Streets and Chapel and Grove Streets, the rest belonging to Yale University. From 1911 to 1928 Yale acquired 36 different parcels on the two blocks from Elm to Grove Streets through a series of interesting transaction s using \"trusts and trusted friends in order to acquire property for itself while vesting legal title in another's name.\" This was done to keep the University's name off the public r ecords thus not allowing the property owners \"to exact a holdout premium.\" Yale's \"false front\" acting as the Trustee holding the property was \"almost exclusively the Union & Ne w Haven Trust Company,\" A company with at least three Bones members in the fi rm, one serving as president for 20 years and Chairman of the Board for 10. Some of the se transactions were just simple actions with the trust company holding the property for a few months. The University's purchase of the three lots, which gave Yale the entire frontage of High Street from Wall to Grove Streets — where today, stands the Sterling Law School — was a bit more complex. The University acquired the property in a convoluted four-year scheme with Edward Harkness again supplying oil money for the purchase. The parcel was placed in th e name of Bonesman Samuel H Fisher (S&B 1889), a New Haven lawyer, a Yale gen eral counsel, a Fellow of the Yale Corporation and Director of New York Trust among many others. Part of the property deal was the site of the Hopkins Gr ammar School, a prestigious school of long tradition, which many Bonesmen inclu ding founder William Huntington Russell attended. The chairman of the Hop- kins School, Bonesman Simeon E. Baldwin (1861), facilitated the deal. Baldwin was part of a very powerful Bones Machine in Connecticut and Yale at the time. He served as Governor of Yale 1911-15, after serving from 1907-10 as the Chief Justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court, having been on the court since 1893 — all the time holding a Yale Professorship of Law. 395 "},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY The Hopkins' property was \"held\" by Yale University Press, a separate \"entity legally distinct from the university,\" that was ver y much under the influence of Bones and friends at Yale.

The manipulation for control had been going on at Y ale for many years, Frorr America's Secret Establishment by Antony Sutton: Daniel Coit Gilman is the key activist in the revol ution of education by The Order. The Gilman family came to the United States from Norfolk, Engl and in 1638. On his mother's side, the Coit family came from Wales to Salem, Massachusetts before 1638. Gilman was born in Norwich, Connecticut July 8,1831 , from a family laced with members of The Order and links to Yale College (as it was know n at that time). Uncle Henry Coit Kingsley (The Order '34) was Treasurer of Yale from 1862 to 1886. James I. Kingsley was Gilman's uncle and a Professor at Yale. William M. Kingsley, a cou sin, was editor of the influential journal New Englander. 396"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"T HE T OMB On the Coit side of the family, Joshua Coit was a m ember of The Order in 1853 as well as William Coit in 1887. Gilman's brother-in-law, the Reverend Joseph Parris h Thompson ('38) was in The Order. Gilman returned from Europe in late 1855 and spent the next 14 years in New Haven, Con- necticut - almost entirely in and around Yale, cons olidating the power of The Order. His first task in 1856 was to incorporate Skull & B ones as a legal entity under the name of The Russell Trust. Gilman became Treasurer and Will iam H. Russell, the cofounder, was Presi- dent. It is notable that there is no mention of The Order, Skull & Bones, The Russell Trust, or any secret society activity in Gilman's biography, nor in open records. The Order, so far as its members are concerned, is designed to be secret, an d apart from one or two inconsequential slips, meaningless unless one has the whole picture . The Order has been remarkably adept at keeping its secret. In other words, The Order fulfi lls our first requirement for a conspiracy - i.e., IT IS SECRET. The information on The Order that we are using surf aced by accident. In a way similar to the surfacing of the Illuminati papers in 1783 when a messenger carrying Illuminati papers was killed and the Bavarian police found the documents. All that exists publicly for The Order is the charter of the Russell Trust, and that tells yo u nothing On the public record then, Gilman became assistant Librarian at Yale in the fall of 1856 and \"in October he was chosen to fill a vacancy on the New Haven Board of Education.\" In 1858 he was appointed Librarian at Yale. Then he mo ved to bigger tasks. The Sheffield Scientific School he Sheffield Scientific School, the science departm ents at Yale, exemplifies the way in which The Order came to control Yale and then the United States. In the early 1850s, Yale science was insignificant, just two or three very small departments. In 1861 these were concentrated into the Sheffield Scientific School with private funds from Joseph E. Sheffield. Gilman went to work to raise m ore funds for expansion. Gilman's brother had married the daughter of Chemis try Professor Benjamin Silliman (The Order, 1837). This brought Gilman into contact with Professor Dana, also a member of the Silliman family, and this group decided that Gilman should write a report on reorganization of Sheffield. This was done and entitled Proposed P lan for the Complete Reorganization of the School of Science Connected with Yale College. While this plan was worked out, friends and members of The Order made moves in Washing- ton, D.C., and the Connecticut State Legislature to get state funding for the Sheffield Scientific School. The Morrill Land Bill was introduced into C ongress in 1857, passed in 1859, but vetoed by President Buchanan. It was later signed by Presi dent Lincoln. This bill, now known as the Land Grant College Act, donated public lands for St ate colleges of agriculture and sciences... and of course Gilman's report on just such a colleg e was ready. The legal procedure was for the Federal government to issue land scrip in propo rtion to a state's representation, but state legislatures first had to pass legislation acceptin g the scrip. Not only was Daniel Gilman first on the scene to get Federal land scrip, he was firs t among all the states and grabbed all of Connecticut's share for Sheffield Scientific School ! Gilman had, of course, tailored his report to fit the amount forthcoming for Connecticut. No o ther institution in Connecticut received even a whisper until 1893, when Storrs Agricultural College received a land grant. Of course it helped that a member of The Order, Aug ustus Brandegee ('49), was speaker of the Connecticut State Legislature in 1861 when the state bill was moving through, accepting Connecticut's share for Sheffield. Other members of The Order, like Stephen W Kellogg ('46) and William Russell ('33), were either in the State Leg islature or had influence from past service. The Order repeated the same grab for public funds i n New York State. All of New York's share of the Land Grant College Act went to Cornell University.

Daniel Gilman was rewarded by Yale and bec ame Professor of Physical Geography at Sheffield in 1863. In brief, The Order was able to corner the total st ate shares for Connecticut and New York, cutting out other scholastic institutions. This is the first example of scores we shall present in this series - how The Order uses public funds for i ts own objectives. And this, of course, is the great advantage of Hege l for an elite. The State is absolute. But the State is also a fiction. So if The Order can ma nipulate the State, it in effect becomes the absolute. A neat game. And like the Hegelian dialec tic process we cited in the first volume, The Order has worked it like a charm. Back to Sheffield Scientific School. The Order now had funds for Sheffield and proceeded to consolidate its control. In February 1871 the Sc hool was incorporated and the following became trustees: Charles J. Sheffield Prof. G.J. Brush (Gilman's close friend) Daniel Coit Gilman (The Order, '52) W.T. Trowbridge John S. Beach (The Order, '39) William W. Phelps (The Order, '60) Out of six trustees, three were in The Order. In ad dition, George St. John Sheffield, son of the benefactor, was initiated in 1863, and the firs t Dean of Sheffield was J.A. Porter, also the first member of Scroll & Key (the supposedly compet itive senior society at Yale). How The Order Came To Control Yale University rom Sheffield Scientific School The Order broadened its horizons. The Order's control over all Yale was evident by th e 1870s, even under the administra- tion of Noah Porter (1871-1881), who was not a memb er. In the decades after the 1870s, The Order tightened its grip The Iconoclast (October 13 , 1873) summarizes the facts we have presented on control of Yale by The Order, without being fully aware of the details: They have obtained control of Yale. Its business is performed by them. Money paid to the college must pass into their hands, and be s ubject to their will. No doubt they are worthy men in themselves, but the many whom the y looked down upon while in college, cannot so far forget as to give money f reely into their hands. Men in Wall Street complain that the college comes straight to them for help, instead of asking each graduate for his share. The reason is found in a remark made by one of Yale's and America's Erst men: \"Few will give but Bones me n, and they care far more for their society than they do for the college.\" The Wo olsey Fund has but a struggling existence, for kindred reasons. Here, then, appears the true reason for Yale's pove rty. She is controlled by a few men who shut themselves off from others, and assume to be their superiors ... The anonymous writer of Iconoclast blames The Order for the poverty of Yale. But worse was to come.

The Brewster family has had seve ral members in The Order, in law and the ministry rather than education. We can best conclude this memorandum with a quotati on from the anonymous Yale observer: Whatever want the college suffers, whatever is lack ing in her educational course, whatever disgrace lies in her poor buildings, whate ver embarrassments have beset her needy students, so far as money could have availed, the weight of blame lies upon the ill-starred society. The pecuniary question is one of the future as well as of the present and past. Year by year the deadly evil is growing. The society was never as obnoxious to the college as it is today, and it is just this ill-feeling that shuts the pockets of nonmembers. Never before has it shown such arroganc e and self fancied superiority. It grasps the College Press and endeavors to rule i n all. It does not deign to show its credentials, but clutches at power with the silence of conscious guilt. (pages 65-69) W HERE DID THE MONEY COME FROM ? W HERE D ID I T G O ? here did George Douglas Miller's money come from an d how did it happen that he owned the land around the Tomb? My surmise is that Mr. Miller was acting as a beard for the Skull & Bones Trust. The main front man for the Order's activities in New Haven s ince the mid 1850s, Mr. Gilman, had moved on in the earl y 1870s to serve as the first President of the Univer sity of California in 1872. The Boodle Boys, as Skull & Bones members were being called at the time, needed a new front man an d prevailed upon the obliging Mr. Miller. George spen t his first year after graduation, 1871, working in t he college library system — similar to Mr. Gilman's re - turn to Yale. He then went off into the world but h e didn't really get all that far and soon came back t o New Haven. Once back in town, George soon began to buy up the property arou nd the Tomb and served as a secretary for a local utility. He held many of his positions from his association with Bonesman W.W. Phelps, who was the son-in-law and estate trustee o f John Sheffield the benefactor of Sheffield Scientific School (SSS). Phelps was a congressman, US Minister to Austria and Germany and a very successful business man. He was on the Board of Directors of the National City Bank, The Second National Bank of NY, the United States Trust Company, nine railroad firms an d others. Mr. Phelps was an incorporator and trustee for many years of Sheffiel d Scientific School, which was phased out in the 1950s and became officially part of Yale but with the Trust still exercising control over the land. 399 W"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Back in 1911 when Miller's money ran out, the Order had assumed the Presi- dency of Yale for over 20 years and in the Treasure r's office for over 40 years.

A cathedral is a sanctified church cont aining the cathedra, the bishop's seat of power from which is ruled the diocese. The Saint Denis Basilica near Paris is considered b y many to be the first ex- ample of Gothic architecture. It was begun in 1136 and finished near the end of the thirteenth century. It was built on the site wh ere, according to legend, Saint Denis, the patron saint of France and legendary fir st bishop of Paris, stopped preaching, lay down his head and died. Quite litera lly, or so the tale goes (ac- cording to Golden Legends, compiled in the 13 th century and destined to be a bestseller in the 15 th century, second only to the Bible) that, around th e year 250 AD, St. Denis went to convert the Gauls and was beh eaded by the Romans for his ministrations. The decapitated St. Denis began to p reach a sermon and, carrying his head in his hands, he then walked to the cathed ral site and expired. It eventually became known as the \"royal necropolis of France\" because of all the bluebloods buried there. From the Merovigans to Car olingians to Carpetians to Valois to Bourbons, they are all there, all mixed t ogether it seems.

The rise of the cathedrals — some of the m ost significant buildings of the medieval period — are linked by ma ny historians and researchers with the rise of the Knights Templa r and, later, the Freemasons. The builder of St. Denis, Abbot Sug er, used the Templars for a capital transfer transaction with Ki ng Louis VII of France in 1148, while he was on the Second Crusa de. In the 1430s Johannes Gutenberg took four years bui ld- ing his press and then, in another fifteen years (1 455). printed his famous Bibles. This helped to usher in the Re- naissance and the downfall of the Papacy and its fi efdoms. On Halloween in 1517, a well-read Martin Luther nai led his ninety-five theses to the church door, marking the beginning of the Protestant Reformation. Later, in the early 1530s, when snubbed for a divorce, Henry VIII started his own church, the Church of England. By the 1550s people were going to jail in London for practicing their faith differently from proscri bed ecclesiastical tradition. F AITH OF OUR F ATHERS s time and Gutenberg's press spread the Word, the Reformation increased the ferment for social, religious and political change. Around the 1560s in England there emerged a group who were, because of their endeavors to purify the Church of England in theological and liturgical matters, derisively called Puritans. They called themselves Saints and people of God. Other of the faithful wished to separate completely from the mother-church and start a new church. They were cal led Pilgrims and settled in New England in Massachusetts, landing at Plymouth R ock on December 21, 1620. Not quite twenty years later a very devout group of Puritans settled in Connecticut on land purchased from the Quinnipiac Indians in 16 38. The land was not theirs by legal right and they had no deed. The new colony, named New Haven, based part of its claim on the dis covery by John Cabot, who had landed somewhere on the North Americ an shore on the feast-day of St. John the Baptist, June 24, 1497. The New Haven Colony was the wealthiest group to settle in the new world so far. The leaders and their congregation wished to b uild a new Zion on biblical principles and prepare for Christ's ret urn and final judgment. The story of New Haven begins in the parish of Sain t Stephen's, Coleman Street, London. Saul/Paul stoned St. Stephen to dea th outside Damascus. St. Stephen was one of the original seven deacons a nd the first Christian 404 A "},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"G OD AND M AN AND M AGIC AT Y ALE martyr. Saint Stephen's feast day is De- cember 26 th . Saint Stephen's was \"one of London's most influential\" pulpits at the time. In October of 1624, 27 year-old, John Davenport was elected vicar. After fending off accusations of being a Puritan, he was allowed his position and became quite celebrated. Later in 1633, when Charles I appointed William Lau d to the office of Arch- bishop of Canterbury with complete authority to dea l with dissenters within the Church of England, Daven - port left England for exile in the Netherlands. Whi le there, Davenport read the impassioned accounts from his friend John Cotton about New England and soon proceeded back to England to gather his flock to sa ve them from the coming punishment from God soon to be visited upon England in retribution for its mani fold and persistent wickedness. He was hoping to congreg ate the faithful and seek shelter in New England where the saints could prepare for Christ's return and the fi nal judgment. Puritans were true believers and proponents of the strict doctrines of John Cal- vin, a French-born, theologian whose influence can be still felt today. Calvinism beliefs codified at the Synod of Dordt in 1618/19 a re based on total dependence on God and predestination. These are: • that all humans are, inherently wicked and offend G od; • that there is an elect that God chose to be saved r egardless of their actions and how deserving; • that Jesus died just for those special elect, not f or everyone; • that once God has chosen an elect they are saved by irresistible grace no matter what; • that these elect or Saints cannot fall from grace once saved. The most pious, the Hyper-Calvinists (which the New Haven Colony were) hold to the tenet of the doctrine of reprobation, the belief that God purpos e- fully foreordains damnation. In other words, there are those who are predestined to Hell. Some being t he Elect doing \"God's work\" through \"sanctified\" devilish activities.

Mr. Eaton had married Anne Lloyd, widow of Thomas Yale and grandmother of Elihu Yale, benefactor and names ake of Yale University. New Haven was a theocracy with only male church mem bers — The Elect — allowed to vote and hold office. Although they we re a small fraction of the total population, they rule d over the majority. No matter their actual piety, to the people of God, the rest of the populace was considered hopele ssly damned.

The town of the New Haven Colony was laid out in 16 38 into nine squares using magnetic north. The first street \"was laid out half a mile in length and upon it as a base, a square was described.\" Plot allocations w ere completed by 1641 with the center square being public. The four streets State, Church, College and York run east/west, with George, Chapel, Elm and Grove as cr oss streets. New streets bisecting the originals in 1784 were named Orange, Wall, Crow n, Temple and High. In 1640 in the middle of the public square there wa s built a wooden meetinghouse. Over the years there have been many different congregations on the green: the \"Prime Ancient Church,\" the \"First Society,\" the White Haven Society,\" the \"New Lights,\" the \"Old Lights\" and others. Over the years there has been much theological discord about just who was saved and who wasn't, and through the many revivals the congregations split, reformed and reunited several times.

When New Haven grew from a town to a city in 1784, the first new street was High Street, going only within the original town square area from George to Grove. In the middle of town at the corner of High and Cha pel Streets, turning-up High and going under the Art Gallery bridge, on the west side of the street, is the Tomb, built in 1856 and expanded several times. Beh ind it is the Secret Courtyard and towers of Weir Hall. Down High Street is the wo rld famous Sterling Library. At the next corner down High St. is the Yale Law Sc hool, alma mater of Bill & Hillary Clinton, Gerald Ford, Joe Lieberman and Cla rence Thomas, among others. Across the street, on the other corner, is a three story white-marble mausoleum- looking building. This is the \"meeting-hall\" of the secret society, Book & Snake. Reporter Bob Woodward and former Treasury Secretary Mcklaus Brady are members.

Funds for such a colony beg an to be collected in 1776 and the American Colonization Society was founded i n 1817. This was not some altruistic crusade but was \"formed solely for the sending to Africa of free Negroes, who were considered extremely dangerous.\" Ezra Stiles is buried at the New Haven Burying Ground, so is Jehudi Ashmun, who some consider the \"founder\" of Liberia (1822). Some praise him, others say he was dictatorial and \"convinced that African-Americans were not capable of running their own political affairs.\" He rescheduled an election afte r bis candidates lost and fixed the next one. This set the stage for years of factional strife. Jehudi left Africa ill with fever and died just a f ew days after landing, in Boston on August 25,1828. His funeral was held two day lat er in New Haven and he was interned in a sarcophagus that today lies just insi de the massive Egyptian gate. Jehudi wasn't a Yalie, (his Whitney family connecti on may be what brought him to rest in New Haven) but the main road curving around the outside of the cemetery was renamed in the 1840s Ashmun Street, near the time when the Egyptian gate was built.

What \"322\" means has been debated for years.

Some say it rep resents the date of the death of Demosthenes, claiming it was upon his philosophy that Bones was founded, Others point to the occultic and numerological aspe cts of the number. Again there are several differing explanations. One being that 322 represents \"the symbolic dimensions for an isosceles triangle with three as the base and the twos becom- ing equal sides. \"In an isosceles triangle with the point of the apex representing a Logos, and the two equal sides flowing from it re presenting the masculine and feminine rays, the horizontal base-line stands for the physical foundation from which the manifested objective world starts into ex istence.\" The most visible and recognized symbol of the group is the skull and crossbones. A symbol of death, that is found on bottles of pois on, pirates flags and the Nazi totenkopf, \"death's head\" the insignia of the Nazi Schutzstaffel or, as commonly known, the SS. It has been used in Prussia for elit e troops as far back as 1740. Some historians date the origin of the skull and cr ossbones to the late Middle Ages, during that period doctors were using the sym bol as a sign of quarantine. It was drawn on doors of patients with strange and/ or deadly maladies. After the Inquisition began in the 13th century, and the persecution of heretics by ecclesiastical tribunals drove non-Catholic thought underground, the heretics began using skull and crossbones to ward off persec utors. There was a slight dif- ference in the heretic's skull and crossbones. It h ad no lower jaw, which signified secrecy and silence. Many don't even notice the mis sing mandible. The symbol soon began showing up on ship's masts, at first use d to keep people away. Later it was used by privateers and pirates. An understanding of Masonry, the Knights Templars a nd the preservation of the old mystery schools is emerging, and evidenc e is accumulating about the Knights Templars devotions to St. John, Mary Magdal ene and their use of the Skull and Crossbones in their symbology, both by th e original Knights Templars, who were disbanded in 1307, and by the current Maso nic commanderies.

Many others are also relevant to understanding this hist ory of secret societies, some specifically about the chapel at Rosslyn, Scotland and the chapel of Sauniere at Renne-le-Chateau, France. First century studies, th e study of intelligence services and methods, financial studies and banking historie s are helpful in understanding the reach and rolodexes of these small but powerful secret organizations. The basic story is that in 70 AD, when Titus was sa cking Jerusalem various familial groups responsible for differing duties, g enerally connected with Temple obligations, gathered their items of diligence such as sacred oils, treasures, and hid them in caves in the Temple Mount and other are as of the country. These families comprised of members of the various priest hoods and royal lines then dispersed, many towards Europe, producing the \"blue bloods.\" According to Knight and Lomas, a familial secret society existed named Rex Deus that was revealed by a father to his chosen son, upon this s on reaching the age of 21. This group emerged above-ground with the Crusades, suppo sedly in accordance with prophecies in Daniel and Isaiah. From The Second Messiah: The picture that was emerging was of a group of Eur opean noble families, descended from Jewish Lines of David and Aaron, who escaped from J erusalem shortly before, or possibly even after, the fall of the Temple. They had passed down the knowledge of the artifacts concealed beneath the Temple to a chosen son (not necessarily the eldest) of each family. Some of the families involved were the Counts of Champagne, Lor ds of Gisors, Lords of Payens, Counts of Fontaine, Counts of Anjou, de Bouillon, St Clair s of Roslin, Brienne, Joinville, Chaumont, St Clair de Gisor, St Clair de Neg and the Hapsburg s. From this group developed the Knights Templar, who went to Jerusalem, were housed on the Temple Mount, later returning to Euro pe to become what many call the first international bankers, They were sol diers, sailors and large landhold- ers and were a very strong political force. The Tem plars were arrested by Phillip the Fair, King of France on Friday, October 13, 130 7 and driven underground or into exile. The Templars, according to several sources, had kno wledge and had explored the North American continent before Columbus. The R osslyn Chapel in Scot- land, built between 1440 and 1490, has stone relief s of plants found only in the Americas. John Cabot, whom many of the major Bones players claim as a relation, sailed from Bristol, England (a port very beholden to the Templars) and Cabot named his American settlement, St, John. The history of Freemasonry is long and tedious. Nev ertheless, we know that Freemasonry emerged officially in 1717 in England a nd soon enjoyed royal protec- tion. During the preceding and proceeding centuries much activity took place in various secret societies both fraternal and magicka l orders. One very interesting ideology that developed out of these circles is syn archy. 414"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"G OD AND M AN AND M AGIC AT Y ALE An excerpt from Picknett and Prince's The Stargate Conspiracy: ... a specific politico-esoteric system, a movement known as Synarchy. This is 'government by secret societies,' or by a group of initiates wh o operate from behind the scenes. It is an analogue of 'theocracy,' or rule by a priesthood. . .. The founder of Synarchy, a Frenchman named Joseph A lexandre Saint-Yves d'Alveydre (1824-1909), explained that the term was the opposi te of anarchy. Whereas anarchy is based on the principle that the state should have no cont rol over individuals, Synarchy proposes that it should have complete control. He proposed t hat Synarchists achieve power by taking over the three key institutions of social control: political, religious and economic. With its own members in positions of power, the Synarchists would, in effect, secretly govern entire states. And why stop there? One of the aims of Syna rchy, from its very inception, was — from the words of a Synarchist document — the creation o f a 'federal European Union.' Is it any coincidence that we are now moving rapidly towards such a European state? Significantly, those words were written as far back as 1946. ... As might be expected from a movement dedicated to g overning by secret societies, Synarchy had close ties with some of the most powerful of su ch organizations, including the Martinist Order, of which Saint-Yves d'Alveydre was Grand Mas ter. As the French writer Gerard Galtier states: \"The synarchic ideal influenced all the Mar tinists and occultists of the beginning of the century.\" 25 Not unexpectedly, Synarchists were also members of French Masonic Lodges, ... Synarchy is by definition a shadowy group lurking b ehind many uprisings and revolutions, and whose jealous gaze is automatically fixed on an y stable regime or established government unless it already conforms to their ideals. ... There is another aspect to Synarchy. The concept of nine legendary leaders plays a large part in its philosophy. ... the Knights Templar, fo unded by nine French knights shortly after the First Crusade. The Templars were believed by Sa int-Yves d'Alveydre to have represented the supreme expression of Synarchy in the medieval worl d, because they had almost total political, religious and financial control during the two cent uries of their existence yet remained at heart a secret, heretical order whose real agenda was kno wn only to its membership. In nineteenth-century France several secret societi es all claimed to be the true descen- dants of the medieval Knights Templar. Saint-Yves d rew upon their ideals and practices for his movement, especially those of certain types of occult Freemasonry known as the Strict Templar Observance and its successor, the Rectified Scottish Rite, thus bestowing on the primarily political movement a strong undercurrent of mysticism And magical rites. This proved to be a two-way traffic, for the Synarchist ideal was adopted by several occultists and their organizations, such as Papus Gerard Encausse, (1865-1916), an enormously influential figure who was the French Grand Master of both the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) and the Masonic Order of Memphis-Misraim, whose rituals, si gnificantly, were based on the rites and ceremonies of the ancient Egyptian priesthood. Papus considered Saint-Yves to be his 'intellectual Master.' As Gerard Galtier wrote: \"Wi thout doubt, the Martinist directors such as Papus ... had the ambition to secretly influence the course of political events, notably by the diffusion of synarchic ideals.\" Papus put the Synarchist ideals into practice by wo rking to bring together the various secret societies of his day, merging orders where p ossible and creating 'confederations' where representatives of the organizations could meet. Th e bodies he created fragmented during the First World War, but others, notably Theodore Reuss and H. Spencer Lewis, created similar groups afterwards. 415"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Undoubtedly, Saint-Yves was hugely influential on t he development of Western occultism. Theo Paijmans, an authority on nineteenth-century E uropean esotericism, pointed out to us that Saint-Yves introduced the seminal idea of Agar tha, the mysterious underground realm from which highly evolved Adepts psychically direct the development of the human race. This was to become a common feature of Western occu ltism — as in the works of Madame H.P. Blavatsky — and was the basis for a belief in Hidden Masters, or Secret Chiefs, which we will discuss shortly. Saint-Yves claimed that he had travelled astrally to Agartha, and that he was in telepathic contact with its inhabitants. He also claimed that he had derived his Synarchist ideology from them. ... The twentieth-century legacy ... involves one o f the most flamboyant and controversial figures of our times - the ritual magician Aleister Crowley. Conjurations of the 'Beast' In March 1904 the — even by then - notorious occult ist Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) and his new wife Rose paid a visit to Cairo where t hey carried out a 'magickal' operation (a 'working') in their rented apartment. The result wa s unexpected. The untrained Rose, totally ignorant of magickal workings (and, if Crowley's so mewhat disloyal description is anything to go by, of much else too), went into trance, repe ating, 'They are waiting for you.' During the next few days, she revealed that 'they' were pr imarily the god Horus, who had chosen Crowley for a special task, telling him the ritual to facilitate contact. At first Crowley was irritated by Rose's words — after all, he was the g reat magus, not her — but then he gave her a series of questions to test the authenticity of t he communicator. When he asked her which planet was traditionally associated with Horus, she answered, correctly, Mars. A few days later, in the Cairo Museum, Rose — who h ad never visited it before - confidently led her husband through the halls to stand before o ne particular exhibit, a rather unremark- able Twenty-Sixth-Dynasty painted wooden stele show ing an Egyptian priest standing before Horus in his form of Ra-Hoor-Khuit (a variation of Ra-Horakhti, who is closely associated with the Sphinx). This has been known ever since in the occult world as the Stele of Reveal- ing. Crowley was impressed by the synchronicity of the exhibit's number - 666, the number of the Great Beast of Revelation, which also happen ed to be Crowley's own proud alter ego, thanks to an overliteral interpretation of the Bibl e by his religious-maniac mother. (When we saw the stele in April 1998, we were amused to note that, although it is now exhibit 9422, the original 1904 label, bearing the number 666 in a beautiful but faded copperplate hand, has been laid beside it in the display case. Could there be Crowleyite sympathizers; on the staff of the Cairo Museum?) This led Crowley, somewhat reluctantly, to take his wife's words seriously. He duly carried out the magickal ritual — now known simply as the C airo Working — which turned out to be a pivotal moment not only in his own bizarre career , but also in the whole history of mod- ern occultism. As a result of this working, he came into contact with an entity called Aiwass (sometimes, for magickal reasons, spelt Aiwaz) who over the course of three days —8-10 April 1904 - 'dictated' to Crowley what has become his 'g ospel,' The Book of Law. pp 264-269 The works of Aleister Crowley still carry a profoun d effect upon Western occultic traditions and practice. The Book of Law redevelope d a theme written in 1532, by Francois Rabelais in Gargantua and Pantragruel, wherein a story speaks of the \"Abbey of Thelma,\" and the only rule is \"do what th ou wilt.\" Crowley reworked it into his famous codex \"Do what thou wilt shall b e the whole of the Law.\" 416"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"G OD AND M AN AND M AGIC AT Y ALE DO C ALVINISM AND R ITUAL M AGIC M IX ? ________________________________ ale and Harvard, both schools were founded and run for many years by Calvinist clerics soon became hot beds of secret so cieties and magical ritual. From Washington Allston — Secret Societies and the Alchemy of Anglo-American Painting: Allston was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, which not only organized the lead- ing members of the New England intelligentsia, but closely associated them with the broader, middle class social base of Freemasonry. A secret f raternity of students and alumni, Phi Beta Kappa derived its rituals and symbols from the Maso nic brotherhood. Like Masonry, the \"master image\" of Phi Beta Kappa was the animating sun, symbol of alchemical wisdom originated from Ancient Egypt. ... They [Masons] celebrated the arts for transmitt ing an ancient body of original truths, deriving not only from the Jews and the masons who built Solomon's Temple, but also from Pythagoras and the Greeks, and from the ancient Egy ptian mythology of Isis, Osiris, and Hermes Trismegistus. The society [PBK] created a magical aura to honor w isdom through initiation ceremonies that led blindfolded candidates toward sudden illum ination and arcane emblems expressing esoteric truths, [emphasis added] The whole art community that surrounded the birth o f Bones and later sur- rounded the Tomb were largely members of Phi Beta K appa (PBK). Many being both Bones and PBK. Such as founders Russell and Ta ft, plus the ever-handy Daniel Coit Gilman. Charles Tracy, an 1832 Yale graduate writes in his Yale College, Sketches from Memory: In those days free-masonry and anti-masonry fought their battles: and a grave question of consience [sic] arose about the promise of secrecy exacted on initiation to the Phi Beta Kappa Society. Harvard was for dissolving the secrecy, an d it sent Edward Everett to the private meet- ing at Yale to advocate the cause. He used a tender tone stood half drooping as he spoke, and touchingly set forth that the students at Harvard h ad such conscientious scruples as to keep them from taking the vow of secrecy, and the society's l ife was endangered. There was stout opposition, but the motion prevailed, and the missionary return ed to gladden the tender consiences[sic] of the Harvard boys. The secret was of course out. The whole world did not stare at the discovery; and a few years had passed the society took back it s secrecy and revived its grip. Most secret societies have structure akin to an oni on or pyramid with a large base or outer layer that makes-up the majority of t he members. These members, called porch brethren in Masonic circles are there for window-dressing and gener- ally have very little idea of the true function of the organization. Then there are the administrators and then at the core a \"secret s ociety within a secret society\" with many times certain key personnel overlapping i nto several secret societal organizations. The Yale secret society Wolf's Head's logo is the h ead of a wolf over an upside down ankh. \"In the Egyptian mysteries a candidate w ould assumed the mantle 417 Y"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY of Osiris and wore a wolf skin. Wolf in French is l ouve and the word louvteau means \"the son of a Mason.\" The ankh is an old Egyp tian symbol generally as- sociated with life and eternity. The mystical and r itual magickal significance of the Wolf's Head logo is there for all to see. There are those who say this is just folderol, just \"fads and fancy\" of students. To others it adds to the evidence that the secret soci eties at Yale are much more than a supplemental educational program of Yale Universi ty or even just a crazy college \"club.\" Demonstrative links to the mystery schools and ritualistic initiatory para- phernalia abound. Do some Bonesmen experience an in itiatory death and rebirth through Yale's underground? Is the crypt of Saint J ohn part of that ritual? Do we find in New Haven a multi-generational cult t hat uses conspiratorial tactics and ritualistic magic in its drama for cont rol? A bigger picture emerges when you look in depth at the historical, architec- tural and genealogical threads, and at the physical geomantic forces at play in New Haven. You could make a case that what exists at Yale is a multi-generational cult that believes in the power of death to bring about change, a group of Zeitgeist initiates believing that the ends justify the means , and using massive deaths to feed their necromancy. Just a bit farther up the geographical draw from th e cemetery is the Winchester Repeating Arms plant, where many of the rifles for deadly warfare have been manufactured, producing many piles of bones — many through conflicts with Bones members playing major political roles. Ron Rosenbaum reported in the New York Observer, Ap ril 23,2001, this chant used in the Order's initiation rites: The Hangman Equals Death! The Devil Equals Death! Death Equals Death. In Alexandra Robbins' apologia for the Order, Secre ts of the Tomb, Bonesmen claim that they just played a joke on Rosenbaum and the ritual was a show. Scroll & Key member Ms. Robbins, after saying that she thought \"the ceremony described in Rosenbaum's article sounded much to vu lgar for Skull and Bones, then quotes a Bonesman \"laughing heartily\" and sayi ng, \"We wanted to fuck with that prick.\" As Governor of Texas, George W Bush \"hung\" all pris oners sentenced to death that he had an opportunity to kill, except one, Hen ry Lee Lucas — a confessed serial killer for a shadowy cult. Bonesman and US p olitical power player Henry L Stimson takes credit for talking President Truman into dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These are just two of th e Order's death-dealing activities. 418"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"G OD AND M AN AND M AGIC AT Y ALE The primary families of the Order are all inter-rel ated and related to Euro- pean royalty.

The river at that point is about three miles wide and the American ship channel sweeps the eastern side of the island. Being thus near the center of the river, the islan d commands a superb view for many miles both up and down the river and is exposed to the prevailing breezes which blow north and south along the course of the stream. The island is irregular in form, with a shore line two miles in length, following the bays and indentations. It is covered to the wat er's edge by a natural forest which has been preserved and is traversed in all directions by wooded paths, of which more than fifteen miles have been laid out . THE \"OUTLOOK\" This is the main club house, located on the east- ern side of the island, with a rocky bay on one sid e and the broad St. Lawrence in front. The house rise s from a granite ledge on the river bank, and a wide gallery opening out of the lounging room projects over the clear green waters, which are there more than 100 feet deep. In the \"Outlook\" are fifteen bed rooms, each with hot and cold water; and five bath rooms. Each room is furnished in a unique way.

In the northern part is the dining room, comfortably and picturesquely fur- nished, commanding light and air and beautiful river views through the broad windows at its either extremity. The lounging room opens out of this, and with its large windows and water gallery seems poised over the brink of the river. In the south wing is the main hall filled with a collection of curious and beautiful mementos and relics gathered from many lands, while beside the great fire place a short stairway leads to the library, a semi-circula r room back of the chimney—a room that must be seen to be appreciated and understood. THE \"STONE HOUSE\" This is located 100 yards from the \"Outlook,\" close to the shore and in a heavily wooded dell. It is a large building of native stone with a Flemish roof. In the lower part is a great hall (not yet fi n- ished.) Its walls are to be hung with a collection of ancient armor which is now in the keeping of the Albany Historical Society. At the rear of the hall is a gallery, and on the floor above it is a suite of six bed rooms with several baths, while on the floor above that is a similar suite of five bed rooms, surrounded by a gallery, which comes well above the tree tops and looks out on a magnificent view. 456"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"T HE D EER I SLAND C LUB 457"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIET : 458"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"T HE D EER I SLAND C LUB The Deer Island Club Corporation. 29 THE \"LEDGES\" This is for the accommodation of men bringing their wives and families or friends.

Every college in the land has its secret societies — even Harvard ca nnot deprive them of in existence within its halls. But at all the other colleges and universities except Yale the Freshmen are elected soon after entering, and remain active members of the organization during the entire four years. Beginning, then, with the societies of Freshmen year , we find three such societies now in existence at Yale. As with the organizations in the two succeeding classes, these societies are known and designated by letters of th e Greek alphabet, the letters selected being the initial letters of the secret motto of th e society. They are known as Delta Kappa ( ), founded in 1845; Kappa Sigma Epsilon, or \"Sigma Fps\" ( ), founded in 1840; and Gamma Nu ( ), a sort of half-and-half secret society, founded in 1855, A fourth society, Sigma Delta ( ), founded in 1849, expired in 1860. A Freshman on entering college has an opportunity to join either one of th ese three societies, and if he has friends in an upper class, is pretty sure to join whichever one they may recommend. The rivalry between the societies is solely one of numbers, and many interesting and humorous stories of the influences used to induce a would-be Freshman to join one or the other of the two first-named might be repeated ad libitum, Z ealous Sophomores have paid hotel bills, driven in hired carriages all around the cit y carried carpet-bags, and furnished With an unlimited supply of cigars, wine, and suppers, F reshmen whom they wished to secure for their organization, only to fie mortified in th e end by the discovery that the Freshmen was already pledged to the rival organization, or w as a smooth-faced graduate of many years' standing. The society meetings in this year are held on Saturday nights, breaking up at midnight, and the exercises, are of a literar y character, sometimes varied by a dra- matic entertainment. Despite the popular belief to the contrary, not a drop of wine is allowed within any society hall in college, and thi s rule, we have been informed on good authority, is seldom if ever violated. \"Sigma Eps\" has one chapter or branch at Dartmouth College; Delta Kappa has one at Amherst as well as o ne at Dartmouth; Gamma Nu has no chapters, and is a weak society at the best. All told, the first named society has had about 1600 members, the second about 1900, and the third 400. An allusion to these societies would not be complete without a reference to their initiations, which are known of and cited throughout the country as illustration s of pandemonium broken loose. Until 1869 they were very rough in character, and often r esulted in serious injury to some of their victims; but since then a professor has been present during the sports, to interfere in case they are carried too far. Tossing in a blan ket, rolling in a wheel, stowing away in a coffin, sitting, suddenly in a tub of ice, or put under a guillotine, where the knife is arrested within a few inches of the victim's nose, and members yelling, blowing horns, burning phosphorus, and masked as skeletons and dem ons-these are what a candidate has to pass through before being invested with the dignity of membership. The Sophomore societies are now mere stepping-stone s to a Junior organization, and are almost entirely of a social character. They are at present two in number — Delta Beta Chi ( ), and Phi Theta Psi ( ) — and have each from thirty to thirty-five member s. In a class of ordinary size this leaves about half the members out in the cold. The first Sophomore society I was established in 1838, and wa s known as Kappa Sigma Theta, and flourished until 1858. Alpha Sigma Phi was establis hed in 1846; and was-broken up in 1864 by the faculty and from its ashes sprang the t wo organizations already mentioned. All the college societies have rooms of their own, guarded by ponderous iron doors, and furnished, so report says, elaborately and elegantl y.

In Junior year there are three -societies, two of w hich own handsome buildings of their own, illustrations of which accompany this ar ticle. Alpha Delta Phi, founded in 1832 at Hamilton College, is the weak member of the triad, its chapter at, Yale, which was established in 1836, ranking the lowest in the college estimation. It has twenty-two chapters in the different colleges throughout the U nion, and numbered 3650 members all told when its last catalogue was issued. Among its prominent members may be cited D. G. MITCHELL ('Ilk Marvel\"), W. L. KINGSLEY (edito r of the New Englander), General DICK TAYLOR, President D. C. GILMAN (of the Cal ifornia University), G. W. SMALLET, Governor DENNISON (of Ohio), and Senato r PUGH, HORACE MAYNARD, Dr. STORRS, J. R. LOWELL, Rev. E. E. HALE, MAN TON MARBLE, and others, while the late Chief Justice CHASE, Rev. H . W. BEECHER, and CASSIUS M. CLAY are among its honorary members. This society has no hall of its own at Yale. The society of Psi Upsilon is one of the best-known of college societies; it was founded at Union College in 1833, and established a chapter at Yale in 1838 ; has now fifteen chapters, and a roll of membership with about 3500 names. Among its members are Senator FERRY, DWIGHT Foster, ANDREW D. WHITE, CHAUNCEY M. Depew, E W. SEWARD, GALUSHA A. GROW, Amos F. AKERMAN and a host of other equally well-known names. It owns a beautiful hall on High Street, with a front of twenty-six feet and a depth of sixty-six feet. The material is red pressed brick, inlaid with ornamental work in black, and it has a Mansard-roof. Inside is a fine theatre or exhibition-hall and several other rooms. The cost of the property was a bout $15,000. The other Junior society is that of Delta Kappa Eps ilon, founded at Yale in 1.844. It has now no less than thirty-eight chapters and n early 5000 members. Among them are CHARLTON F. LEWIS, Major-General SWAYNE, Profess or NORTHROP, J. H. DRUMMOND, General F. A. WALKER, J. Q. ADAMS, Jun.; fi nd among its honor- ary members General BURNSIDE, SCHUYLER COLFAX, BAYARD TAYL OR, and others. Its hall is on York Street, and was built i n 1861 of red brick, and has a front of twenty-four feet six inches, with a depth of forty- five feet, and the property is valued now at about $10,000. Last, though by no means least, come the Senior soc ieties, two in number, whose mysteries are \"deep, dark, unfathomable,\" and an el ection to either of which is one of the coveted college honors. Skull and Bones, and Scr oll and Key are the euphonious names by which these two organizations are known to the college world. Of the two the first-named is also first in position and in honor. Not much is known about its origin, except that it is supposed to have been founded in 1933. It takes each year fifteen new members, who are claimed to be the most prominent i n their respective class either as scholars, literary men, or social companions. Its h all is on High Street near Chapel and is a grim-looking, windowless, tomb-like structure, built of brown sandstone, and with a front of thirty-five and a depth of forty-four fe et. It stands in a lot forty by seventy, and the value of the property is estimated at $30,000. Scroll and Key was founded in 1841, and it also tak es fifteen new members every year. Its hall is undoubtedly the handsomest colleg e society structure in the United States, and it stands on the corner of College and W all streets. It has a front of thirty-six feet, with a depth of fifty-five feet, in a lot for ty-eight by ninety-two, and the light yel- low Cleveland stone is the chief material of which i t is composed.

So far we have sketched the history of the societie s of the academic department. Two more remain, Phi Beta Kappa, which is represente d in every college, and has for its members the leading scholars in every class, an d Chi Delta Theta, a revived society, which formerly comprised the leading literary men, and now is confined to the five edi- tors of the Yale Literary Magazine. The Sheffield. Scientific School has also several secret societies, but the school itself is too young for t hem to have any history. In leaving the subject of secret societies ofYale, much of course remains unsaid as not being pertinent to the limits of a newspaper articl e. College politics are kept alive in all their intricacies by the societies, which represent in that respect the parties of the outside world. Friendships are formed in them which last th rough life, and the old graduate finds an old familiar spot in his society hall when he re turns to his alma mater and meets none but strange faces and new buildings about him. 'The secret societies form the college life, and their existence is apparently assured. They \"Mask their business from the common eye;\" but even if their doings were open to public inspec tion, but little would be revealed not already known or surmised.

Ilium fuit! — Published by the Order, 1876 — BABYLON IS FALLEN. ANY one who was noticing the Bones men of '77, on t he morn- ing of Sunday, October 1st, 1876, was probably stru ck by the crest-fallen air which characterized all of the m. At any rate there were those who observed that during the churc h services their eyes suspiciously scanned the faces of one ne utral after another, and invariably dropped if their glance was returned. The reason for this is a simple one. As long as Sku ll and Bones Society shall exist, the night of September 29th wi ll be to its members the anniversary of the occasion when their Temple was invaded by neutrals, some of their rarest memorabil ia confisca- ted, and their most sacred secrets unveiled to the vulgar eyes of the uninitiated. We have thought that a description of how this was done might be of interest to the college world. The back -cellar windows of the Eulogian Temple were fortified as fo llows : First, to one seeking entrance from the outside, wa s a row of one-inch iron bars; behind them a strong iron ne tting fast- ened to a wooden frame; behind this another row of iron bars, one and one quarter inches thick; and still behind this a heavy wooden shutter. Formidable as these defenses appear , the O EDEE OF THE F ILE AND C LAW , having procured a supply of files, skeleton keys, etc., determined to attempt to effec t an entrance. For reasons that need not be rehearsed here, the wo rk proceeded slowly, and it was only after many hours of patient and cau- tious labor that one of the outside bars was cut in two. Next, by means of a powerful claw, the long nails that fa stened the iron netting to the wooden frame were drawn out. Th en the bar was re-fastened in its place by means of a litt le putty, and we retired to await a favorable night for finishing the job. Eight o'clock Friday evening, September 29th, was the hou r selected. 469"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY First, one of our number proceeded to remove the ir on bar and the netting, and then, for the sake of more roo m, he, with considerable difficulty, got out the strong wooded frame to which the latter had been fastened. Pushing head and shou lders into the opening thus made, there still remained a stron g row of one and one quarter inch iron bars. Fortunately there w as no need to file through these. It was found that they were fastened above in a thick joist, but below ran into a brick \"damp-wall\" that was built up inside, and two inches from, the stone founda- tion-wall of the building. By the aid of a claw and a hatchet, it was the work of but a few moments to dig away ab out twenty inches of this wall, and thus loosen an iron plate through which the lower ends of the bars ran. Upon pushing this p late in- ward, the bars all fell out with their own weight; the flimsy wooden shutter was then easily wrenched from its po sition, and at just half past ten o'clock an entrance into the cellar was ob- tained. Passing in through the window, we broke ope n the wooden door at the top of the cellar stairs, opened the two iron shutters which close the back windows of the main h all, and proceeded to examine the Temple at our leisure. For the bene- fit of future explorers, and as a directory for new -fledged Bones men for all time, we will now give a brief descript ion of THE INTERIOR OF SKULL AND BONES HALL.

Some of the old memorabil is qui te curious, and the collections relating to recent years are ve ry complete. The Bones catalogue is essentially as described in Four Years at Yale. The doors to E and F, which are used as general sto rerooms, are protected by plates of sheet-tin, but the locks were not \"what we may call\" proof against skeleton keys. The memora bilia in these rooms was noteworthy for amount rath er than quality. However, in the midst of a good deal of ru bbish we found four or five boating flags, and a number of o ld Greek, Latin and German works in MB. None of these were so ciety records, but works of well-known authors; into the genuine an- tiquity of the MSS. we have not as yet been able to examine. In conclusion, we will say that a thorough examinat ion of every part of the Temple leads us to the conclusion that \"the most powerful of college societies \" is nothing mor e than a pleas- ant convivial club. The kitchen contains the materi als for serv- ing refreshments for the inner man; there are neith er billiard tables nor any kind of musical instrument in the bu ilding; there is a total absence of all the \"machinery\" which we had been led to expect; the bell heard on initiation nights is not \"the old college bell;\" Skull and Bones has no secrets beyon d a few that may be handed down annually by word of mouth, and n o writ- ten constitution beyond a few directions similar to the sugges- tions appended to the Delta Kappa by-laws. Before leaving the hall, it was asked whether we sh ould in- form other members of the college of what we had do ne, and throw open the hall to the public.

But while we had no consideration for the mysterious popiecock o f Skull and Bones Society, we nevertheless remembered that some of the Bones men of '77 are our warm personal friends, and therefore we preferred a less radical course. To Bones as a p leasant con- vivial club, we have no objections. Let her live on as long as men enjoy good suppers and quiet whist. But her mys tery and her secresy are at an end, and we hope her absurd p retensions and her popiecock are dead also. The burglary was not discovered until the following evening, at about eight o'clock. All day Saturday the great Skull and Bones lay at the mercy of any one who might notice the back window. How thoroughly the society was frightened can be se en by the way they have sealed up the window through which we entered, as well as more recently all of the other five base ment openings. We have no idea that Skull and Bones will deny that their hall has been entered, for we are not without proofs tha t our tale is true. We have above spoken of different manuscripts , trinkets and memorabilia as existing in the Temple. In sever al cases we should have written \"existed,\" for the place that k new them shall know them no more forever. In short, while robbery was not our errand, on the principle that the second thief is t he best owner we helped ourselves to a few pieces of memorabil, whic h can be put on exhibition, and a few documents which can be pri nted, should any authoritative denial be made to any essential p oint in this statement. Nor will Bones' usual policy of silence avail to throw discredit upon our story. Part of our memorabil has been seen by Senior neutrals, and the remainder will be put w here it will do the most good, as soon as the protection of a sh eepskin has been placed between us and the Faculty and the law.

NEW HAVEN, CT L AST T HURSDAY NIGHT AST THURSDAY NIGHT the hall on the corner of Colleg e and Wall streets, occupied by the Scroll and Key Society, was painted by some unknown person in such a manner as to deface and seriously mar the fine effect of the marble front. All college disapproved the act, and many were glad when it was known that two detectives were engaged in wo rking up the matter. Many, however, considered that the more dignified s tand taken by the Skull and Bones Society which had suffered a similar, tho ugh from the nature of the building material, less injury would have been the proper treatment. Friday afternoon several suspicious looking men wen t through South college in a vague sort of a way, inquiring for bed-room se ts, etc., and during annual, one room at least was searched. Early in the evening Edmund R. Terry, a Senior, fro m Brooklyn, was pointed out to a constable by a classmate named Jewett. Several men were at the fence at the time, and so the demand for a warrant was met by the answ er: \"You can't come any Sandy Hollow game over me,\" allusion being made, accordin g to Chief Allen, to a resident in Sandy Hollow, a low part of New Haven, who deman ded to see a warrant and, on its being produced, relieved the constable of it. H e was finally persuaded to exhibit his warrant to Terry at a distance from the, party. Ter ry was taken to the Station House, and bailed out by a classmate, Mr. Briggs. Herbert W. Bowen, also a Senior and Brooklynite, was arrested a little later, and baile d by Mr. A. A Dershimer, 78. The warrants were examined, and the charge found to be, \"defacing the build- ing of the Kingsley Trust Association. The names of E. S. Charlier, and J. W. Eaton, '79; M. Wilcox, '78; and Tutor E. S.

Porter and M. Wilcox, '78, and Ten Eyck and Donaldson, '79, and s everal graduates, among them Frank Ingersoll and John W Ailing of this city. No Bones men were visible. The disposal of three drunks, and a family jar occu pied the Court until. 10, and during this time some of the audience got tired and departed. Finally the case of E. R. Terry was called, and the charge of defacing Keys hall read. Terry plead not guilty, and E. S. Dana took the stand. Tutor Dana t estified that he was a member of the Kingsley Trust Association, and one of the t rustees of the building. He saw the building after the defacement of Thursday night . Mr. Doolittle, attorney for the defence, objected to the word defacement. It was ch anged, and the witness proceeded to testify that \"the hall had been ornamented — we will say decorated, adorned, — \" by laying on in black paint, in front and at th e side, of certain figures. \"What were those figures?\" \"A 5, a 2, and a 2.\" E. S. Charlier testified that he was a member of th e Junior class resident at 82 Wall street. First saw Terry on Thursday night at 1 0:30 near Farnam College. He came up and peered into my face. We went over to Ke y's Hall. There Terry came up and looked into my face. I saw a man at work in front of the hall. Quite a number of men, presumably students were on the N. E . corner. They crossed the street one by one, and, without addressing the pain ter inspected his work. Mr. C. testified to a conversation with Bowen, in w hich Bowen warned him, not to interfere. He did not see the painter's face . Failed to recognize him. Could not describe him. Does not know whether he was a co llegian or not. When the work was done, he followed the painter, en deavoring to ascertain who he was. Bowen went with him. They went down Wal l to High, but failed to overtake the painter, although neither party ran . Three or four men were with the painter, who had a pot or vessel of paint with him. The inscription on the steps was 522 SCULL & BONE. On the side were two or three 522's. Does not know to what purpose the building is appli ed. The Keys society has no peculiar number to his know ledge. One society in college employs the number 322. Mr. C. was asked if he belonged to any college society. \"I belong to Linonia.\" \"Are you a secret member of Keys? \"I am a member of no secret organization in Yale Co llege.\" James W Eaton was called and testified that he met Terry near the south entry of Farnam, between 10:30 and 11:30 Thursday evening . Had a conversation with him. Terry told him of the decoration of the hall, and stating that he had taken no part in the procedure. Had produced a small tube of pigment done up in foil, with the remark that it would make \"first-cla ss memorabil.\" 478"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"L AST T HURSDAY N IGHT - C OLLEGE V ANDALISM This closed the case against Terry. The defense did not introduce any evidence. Pickett , for the prosecution, claimed that Terry had aided and abetted in a consp iracy to deface the hall. Doolittle, for the defense, called the act a harmle ss college prank. All injury to the hall could have been removed in a few hours with a little common sense and some potter's clay. The numbers were evidently placed there merely to cause laughter. If Terry had no right to be present, how came Charlier there? Charlier was equally guilty. Eaton's evidence was for the de fense, for he had testified that Terry had stated at the time that he had no part in the proceedings. The Court very justly pronounced the work as low an d mean and beneath the dignity of any one who pretended to be a gentleman, but said that there being no conclusive proof, he would have to nolle the cas e. Bowen's case came next and seeing no hope of convic ting him by Mr. Pickett's tactics, Ailing came to the rescue. E. S. Charlier testified that he had seen Bowen on the corner of Wall and Col- lege streets, Thursday evening. He had but a slight acquaintance with Bowen, having been casually introduced a week before. Neve rtheless, he went up to Bowen, notwithstanding the fact that Bowen was an u pperclass-man. Bowen had remarked \"Good evening.\" Charlier replied , \"I think this is nice, don't you?\" Bowen said in effect that it was none o f his business. Charlier said, \"I call this low business for a gentleman, a gentle man of Yale.\" All the rest of the party crossed the street separately. Bowen and Char lier crossed together. They followed the, painter together until Bowen advised Charlier to give tip the pursuit, saying, \"What are you meddling here for? You will g et into trouble.\" Mr. Ailing: \"Is Bowen a member of Scroll and Key?\" Charlier: \"No. He has the reputation of being 'sat on' in his own class.\" Mr. Doolittle: \"Have you the reputation of making b ets and not paying them in your own class?\" Pickett objected and the question was not pressed. Pickett began asking about Senior societies, but Ai ling and Marion Wilcox spoke to him and he desisted. Doolittle wanted to know if Charlier was a candidat e for membership in Keys. Pickett objected. Charlier's impression was that Bo wen was superintending the matter. He, supposed Bowen was engaged in mischief and \"volunteered, the information that he thought it was a low business f or a gentleman.\" Doolittle considered such remark to a mere bystander an insul t. Charlier considered himself \"as much a gentleman as you are, and\" [with a splendid stage gesture] \"I appeal to you, your hono r.\" His honor told him to go on with his evidence. Afte r some evidence of trifling importance, Eaton was called, and testifie d that he had seen Bowen enter the South entry of Farnam rapidly, Thursday e vening, in a dark suit of presumably old clothes. He wore a slouch hat, and h ad his coat collar turned up about his neck. 479"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY E.

Came out in response to a call. \"He and a crowd started off on a brisk walk, attended by a peculiar motion of the he el and toe, characteristic of the Keys society; an old but, somewhat childish custom, I should like to be permit- ted to observe.

Ailing spoke for the prosecution, and Doolittle for the defense. Doolittle gave Ailing some \"taffy\" about his member ship in Keys. Called him the real conspirator, compared him to Catiline. So sensitive, you know. Argued that there was no proof of Bowen's participation or conspiracy. Called it a college jest. The society considered its hall not disfigure d and disgraced by the paint, but by the emblem of a rival Society. Judge Peck spoke a few minutes treating the perpetr ators of the outrage with the contempt they so well deserve, but acquitted Mr . Bowen with the remark that he considered the case as beneath the dignity and unworthy the attention of the Court, and the remark that though he conside red Terry's testimony as sufficient proof of the existence of a conspiracy, there was no proof of Bowen's participation.

COLLEGIATE VANDALISM TRIED FOR DEFACING A BUILDING. JUDGE PECK THINKS THE MATTER ONE TO BE SETTLED O UT OF C OURT . HE CITY COURT ROOM was crowded with students this m orning, who had gathered to witness the trial of Edmund R. Terry and Herbert W. Bowen, arrested on a charge of having ai ded, abetted and conspired to deface the hall occupied by the Sc roll and Key Society on the corner of College and Wall streets, on the n ight of the 13th inst. The accused were defended by Tilton E. Doolittle, a nd Mr. Pickett was assisted in the prosecution by John W. Ailing, of t he class of '62, and a former member of Scroll and Keys. The first party tried was Mr. Terry. Edward S. Dana , a tutor at Yale, testified that he saw the building after its defacement on the nig ht of the 13th, and also on the same day. He saw the figures \"522\" on the wall betw een the staircases leading into the building, painted on the white wall in black figure s. He also testified that the building belonged to the Kingsley Trust association, of whic h he was one of the trustees. Mr. E. S. Charlier, a Junior, who \"gave the business away, \" next told his story. He was going by Farnam hall on the night when the ornamentation of the hall took place, and there saw Mr. Terry, who looked at him full in the face t wo or three times, he returning the look, so as to be able to fully recognize Terry. He then went along up to Wall street where he has rooms, and found some one engaged in a rtistic work at Keys hall, and fonr[sic] students, two of whom he recognized as Te rry and Bowen, looking at the work, the latter apparently superintending it. He a ddressed Bowen with whom he had a[n] jgh[sic] acquaintance and returned the sal utation. Then Charlier said \"Don't 481 T"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY you think this is nice business,\" and Bowen respond ed \"It's none of your business.\" Mr. Charlier said \"I call it low business for a gen tleman of Yale to be engaged in.\" He was then informed that it would be a very health y thing for him to do to avoid meddling and go about his own business. At this poi nt the painter whose back was kept studiously turned toward him went away, being escorted by one of the party, the other three remaining behind and intimating to him that he must not interfere and that if he did there would be trouble. He followed the painter for some distance and finally thinking discretion the better part of valo r, left the party and went home. Mr. James W. Eaton another junior testified to having s een the ornamentation, as it had pleased Mr. Doolittle to call the defacement. He ha d also seen Mr. Terry at Farnam college that evening, and they had some conversatio n in relation to the matter of the decoration, Mr. Terry telling him what was done, an d taking a small can of pigment from his market remarked, \"This will make a first-c lass memorabil.' He described the disfiguring of the walls of Keys Hall, which bore i n black paint the legend \"522 S CULL and Bone 522 [.]\" This closed the case against Terr y who did not testify at that time, and after short arguments in which Mr. Doolittle claims that nothing was proven and Mr. Pickett that there was a clean case against Terry o f his having cognizance of, and aiding in or abetting the disgraceful work. The court pron ounced the work as low, mean, and beneath the dignity of any one who pretended to be a gentleman, but said he should have to order the case nolled, as there was no conc lusive proor[sic] against him. Then came the case against Bowen, and Mr. Ailing, s eeing there was no hope of convicting him in the way in which Mr. Pickett had been conducting the first, came to the rescue, in order to convict, if possible, th e one who was supposed to be the principal in the affair. Tutor Dana testified to ha ving seen a party of four or five stu- dents on the Campus, among whom was Bowen, who, whe n they saw him, started off in the childish walk assumed by the members of the Scroll and Key society, and began to sing a song which is sung by the members o f that society almost exclusively. Where they went to he did not know. Mr. Charlier re peated his testimony given in the case against Terry, identifying Bowen fully as the man to whom he said that the \"ornamentation\" in progress was low business, altog ether too low for a gentleman at Yale to be implicated it. He also reaffirmed his st atement that Brown said \"You'll get into trouble if you meddle.\" He testified further t hat he saw Bowen go over or and instruct the painter who was engaged in the disgrac eful job, and that Bowen stood within a few feet of him while the painting was in progress. When the party left the building he saw the one that did the painting, whom he did not recognize, and another of the students, each carrying a paint pot. There was considerable talk about secret societies, witness answering that he be- longed to no society in Yale, and he was asked if M r. Bowen did not belong to one the secret societies. His reply was, \"No, sir, Mr. Bowen has the reputation of being one of the men in his class who was... {unreadable} ... statement was greeted with hisses by the studen ts in the room. One of them sit- ting near the reporters table said, \"He'll get h—1 for that when he gets to college.\" 482"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"L AST T HURSDAY N IGHT - C OLLEGE V ANDALISM Mr. Doolittle turned to the witness when the excite ment had subsided and asked, \"Haven't you the reputation among the students of b eing one of those men who refuse to pay bets they have made, when you lose?\" This qu estion was greeted with laughter and applause by the students, but court -ordered th e witness not to answer the question, and ordered the crowd to keep quiet. The cross-exam ination elicited no new facts, and Mr. James W. Eaton was called, and testified to hav ing seen Bowen go into Farnham college soon after 11 o'clock, with an old suits of clothes on, his collar turned up, and a slouch hat pulled down over his eyes. He recogniz ed him by his height. There was considerable excitement when Edmund R. Te rry was called, and as he took the stand he appeared to be a most unwilling witnes s, and appearances in the case were not deceitful this time. He testified to having see n Bowen on the evening on which the outrage was committed, and also to having seen him during the daytime of the same day, but denied that he had entered into any conspi racy with him to deface the build- ing, giving his testimony hesitatingly and guardedl y. He testified that he had purchased some black paint, which he had used in painting a s ign of furniture for sale. He said he had loaned the paint to one Moore, living in the same building, but on the floor below him, the paint to be used for the same purpos e he had used it, and acknowledged having been in Moore's room during the evening, but denied that any conversation relative to the painting of Keys' hall had been had there. He refused to tell who was there beside him, or what the conversation was, on the ground that it might tend to criminate him. He acknowledged having visited Keys hall to see the \"decoration,\" and said that Mr. Charlier's statement was substantiall y correct, as to his visit. He refused to tell who were in the party besides himself and B owen, the court sustaining him in his refusal, he claiming that his sense of honor wo uld not allow him to \"give away\" the parties who were present. He said the party who did the work was disguised, but that he could not tell what the disguise consisted of, a s the party kept his back constantly turned toward the street. He acknowledged that both he and Bowen were witnesses of a portion of the defacing, but denied that they kne w of it before it was done. Short arguments by Mr. Doolittle and Mr. Ailing fol lowed, the former claiming that no conspiracy was proven and that the boys hap pened to be there as spectators as did Mr. Charlier, and that if there had been a c onspiracy, Mr. Bowen would have tried to keep out of the way himself. Mr. Ailing he ld that there was a clear case against the men who, with others of the \"Mythical 522\" fail ing to gain elections to either of the secret societies had taken this method of reven ge. The court (Judge Pack) nolled the case, saying that there was no doubt but that the accused knew of the outrage, but that it was a college prank. If a Grand street boy had done the work, he said, I should fine him $ 25 and costs, and perhaps send him to jail. This is a student's frolic, done in a spirit of fun, and should be settled at the college, and not brought to this court. He ther efore, greatly to the surprise of the majority present, ordered a nolle entered in the ca se. 483"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Wolf's Head FOUNDED 1883 H ENRY H ORNBLOWER A TKINS D ONALD A DELBERT B OYNTON E DMOND T AYLOR C HEWNING , J R .

Little is known of it but it serves us here, for just as Wolf's Head was the product of a wave of protest against the things for which Skull and Bones and Scroll and Key stood in 1883, so the first society to enjoy a long and distinguished life at Yale was started, in part, as a protest against the ways of Crotonia. Linonia, organized in 1753, was apparently a \"crusa ding\" movement designed to bring more democracy to the College. One reads t his between the lines of the brief story of Linonia's origin (the italics in the following quotation are the writer's): \"Of the class which graduated that year [1754], numbering 17 in all,\" says the author of Four Years at Yale, \"one only be longed to the society [Lino- nia] . He was the seventeenth on the list-the names at that time being arranged according to the gentility of the families they rep resented, instead of alphabetically.\" Crotonia lived on for a few years only, while Linon ia came into blossoming days and survived, finally only as a shell of former glo ry, for over a hundred years. 485 C"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Linonia, however, was at first closed to freshmen, who \"in those days of ser- vitude\" were never \"admitted to any Society whateve r\"; and in 1768 Brothers in Unity was founded, definitely a crusading moveme nt. We are told that it was organized \"by 21 individuals in the four classe s of [17]68, '69, '70, and '71 — seven being upper-class men who seceded from Lino nia, and the remaining 14 being Freshmen, who were of course neutrals.\" Th e hero of this movement was a freshman \"who stood up for the dignity of his class; and having found two Seniors, three juniors and two Sophomores, who were willing that Freshmen ... be admitted to a literary Society, he, with thirtee n of his classmates fought for and established their own respectability.\" Brothers in Unity forced the pace on Linonia, just as Wolf's Head did later on Skull and Bones and Scroll and Key. Linonia opened its doors to the freshmen and therea fter for many years the two societies competed on a basis of equality. Both Linonia and Brothers in Unity were secret soci eties; but their secrecy never reached the dignity of \"poppycock \" — the gen eric term adopted later by the Yale undergraduate to denote all the elements i n the secret society system to which he objected. The chief competition between these societies was in the matter of numbers, each attempting to get \"the larg est number of the incoming class.\" Such rivalry in secrecy as existed was a ri valry between two groups of \"ins,\" stimulated to a friendly game of hide-and-seek, it being thought \"a great — as it was an infrequent — triumph for a man to find out t he name of the president or other officers in a rival society.\" Both societi es, too, had much to engross their attention besides the preservation of mystery . They served an important function in a College still inadequately organized. The accumulation of books was begun by them at a very early period; and by 18 70, the number of books in each of the two libraries had reached approximat ely thirteen thousand. The societies also had reading rooms, which were in gen eral use. In addition, the meetings in their halls, while in part devoted to t he popular \"pea-nut bums,\" initiations, elections and the like, included also formal and informal debates, the delivery of orations and the reading of essays and poems, all so much the vogue in those times; and in their hey-day — after 1825 — the societies oc- casionally put on \"exhibitions\": \"a dramatic poem, a tragedy, and a comedy, all written for the occasion,\" being delivered or a cted, each society trying to outdo the other. They were general societies in the truest sense of the word, and lived for many years without creating a need for reform. A third important society was founded in 1779 — the Yale Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. It was not, apparently, a crusading mov ement, for it did not compete with the existing societies. It was a national soci ety, giving the \"bulk\" of its elec- tions to the juniors during the third term, as the senior societies do to this day. Admission to the Society was considered \"one of the greatest honors in college\"; and in spite of stray cases of personal prejudice a nd personal favoritism, scholastic achievement was the sole criterion for membership, \"the society confining its 486"},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"T HE F OUNDING OF W OLF ' S H EAD elections pretty closely to the list recommended it by the faculty, in response to its own application therefor.\" Phi Beta Kappa also had important educational activ ities, supplementing, like those of the general societies, only more seriously , the all-too-rigid curriculum of the day. \"The exercises consisted of an oration and a debate. ... The day after Commencement, it was customary to hold an 'exhibiti on,' when two orations were delivered by tutors or other graduates, and a debate was engaged in by four undergraduates.\" As these exhibitions gradually gre w in interest and importance, it was decided to make them public, \"and in the 42 years, 1793-1834, there were only 12 Commencements when the Society failed to di splay itself.\" Like Linonia and Brothers in Unity, Phi Beta Kappa was an instit ution with an important private and public life in the College. It was, however, a secret society; more secret — th ough in exactly what man- ner we are not told — than the general societies an d hence more open to the temptations of generating \"poppycock.\" Certainly it s secrecy was the secrecy of a small group of \"ins\" against a much larger group of \"outs\"; and as was to happen so often and so notoriously later on in the case of Skull and Bones and Scroll and Key, \"poppycock\" was accompanied by its corolla ry-attacks of a physical nature by the \"outs.\" In the history of Phi Beta Kappa there is record of at least two breakings-in by the \"neutrals\" of the College, acting, we are to ld \"under the united influence of envy, resentment and curiosity.\" In 1786 three s eniors broke open the door of rhe secretary's study and \"feloniously took, stole, and carried away the secretary's trunk, with all its contents.\" They were discovered , the papers returned and the thieves appeared before a general meeting of the so ciety with a \"voluntary\" writ- ten confession, swearing never to divulge whatever secrets they had discovered. A year and a half later the trunk was once more rai ded and its contents stolen, the perpetrators, this time, never being discovered . But about 1825 a much more serious event took place . \"A clamor against Ma- sonry and secret societies generally... swept over the country.\" It seems to have swept through the American colleges as well and to have resulted in the removal of its secret character from Phi Beta Kappa. \"With its mystery departed its activity also; and for forty years past\" — the statement is from Four Years at Yale, published in 1871 — \"it has been simply a 'society institutio n' possessed of but little more life than it claims to-day, though membership in it was thought an honor worth striving for until quite a recent period.\" By 1884, when the Founders of Wolf's Head were getting ready to graduate, Phi Beta Kappa was dead. The College press of the time contains reports of the efforts made by the Yale faculty to revive it. It was dead, however, past all saving except as a symb olic institution. In 1832 with the founding of Skull and Bones begins the era of the senior societies of the type which existed in 1883. Skull and Bones was organized \"by fifteen members of the class which graduated the fo llowing year\" and was, in all probability, an \"outs\" movement, it being recorded that \"some injustice in the 487"},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY conferring of Phi Beta Kappa elections seems to hav e led to its establishment.\" It was not a crusading movement unless — and this m ay well be possible — the need of the human animal for secrecy and mystery is a real need which must be satisfied. The elimination of these elements fro m Phi Beta Kappa-the only important grouping in senior year at this time exce pt Chi Delta Theta, which was distinctly literary — may have left a gaping vo id. Certainly, like all new institutions, Skull and Bones was not taken serious ly at first, being \"for some time regarded throughout college as a sort of burle sque convivial club.\" Certainly too, there is no evidence of any very serious purpo se behind its founding. In fact all of the evidence points to its being a group of congenial individuals enjoying, behind their closed doors, a rather riotous good ti me. The same elements seem to have motivated the foundi ng of Scroll and Key in 1841. It was definitely an \"Outs\" movement, \"its fo unders not being lucky enough to secure elections to Bones.\" But unlike Skull and Bones which had created an organization quite different from Phi Beta Kappa an d not in competition with it, Scroll and Key, at least in the eyes of the Col lege, set out from the beginning to rival the older society on its own ground. \"Its ceremonies, customs and hours of meeting were all patterned after those of Bones, as well as its manner of giving out elections.\" That it was considered a \"sour grap e\" society is indicated by the burlesque in The Yale Banger of 1845, in which the Keys scroll bears the legend, \"Declaration of Independence and Rejection of the S kull & Bone,\" and has for its Great Seal \"a view of the historical fox reachi ng after the equally celebrated grapes.\" This, the author of Four Years at Yale rem arks, \"probably represents, with substantial accuracy, the motive which originated K eys.\" Even more than Skull and Bones the new society had hard sledding at first, failing on at least four occasions prior to 1851 to make up its full quota of fifteen, the number in 1850 falling as low as seven ; but like Skull and Bones it seems to have had no important purpose of existence other than pleasant social intercourse. Being thus limited, these two societies were in a m ore precarious position than the older societies which had had definite activiti es, intellectual and otherwise, within and without their halls. Their very secrecy was a temptation and a handicap. It would seem that at first — during the days of th eir youth, ten, twenty years after their respective foundings — they were merely negatively mysterious. Their members, it seems, said nothing about their activit ies inside their buildings and concealed the arrangement of rooms and furniture. T hey used their moments of public appearance to strut a bit before they retire d for another year into their \"impenetrable mystery.\" They wore their badges mere ly as symbols of membership and took themselves more or less lightly as human b eings in a human world. But with no relation to the world except the self-i mposed duty of perpetuating the species, and no formalized basis for choice oth er than a social one, these societ- ies fell, after a while, into the temptation of usi ng what they had most of— their mysteries and ritual — to startle the College into taking them seriously.

By 1873 the word \"poppycock\" was in current use and the \"god\" who had started life so modestly had become great. But alre ady in 1870 he was strutting and had been strutting for some years. The elements which had gradually come to constitute his most objectionable features will be familiar to all, for many of the hydra-heads have not been severed even to this day, and some which were once severed have grown back again. It is to be supposed, since there is no evidence to the contrary, that from the beginning the members of both Skull and Bones and S croll and Key wore their badges on their neckties. But by 1870 the light-hea rted wearing of a symbol of membership had become a solemn ritual surrounded by ritual. \"This badge is constantly worn by active members,\" says the author of Four Years at Yale (from which volume many of the preceeding[sic] quotations have been taken), \"by day upon the shirt bosom or necktie, by night upon the night dress. A gymnast or boating man will be sure to have his senior badge a ttached to what little clothing he may be encumbered with while in practice; and a swimmer, divested of all garments whatever, will often hold it in his mouth or hand, or attach it to his body in some way, while in the water.\" And as for a nyone touching the pin or speaking of it or of the society, the words of the Horoscope, written much later, vividly describe the result: \"[the society men] ris e up abruptly, put their ears behind their beads and sneak off.\" A similar ritual was built up around the society bu ildings: the mystery that might rightly have attached to the four walls of th e meeting place being extended to unwarranted distances. The impressive Skull and Bones tomb was erected in 1856, and Scroll and Key inhabited, until the compl etion of their fine hall on College Street in 1870 rooms \"in the fourth story o f the Leffingwell Building, corner of Church and Court Streets, across from the Tontine Hotel.\" We are not told directly that the entire Leffingwell Building was held sacred; but we know that by 1870 the senior society men had progressed to the length of at times refusing \"to speak while passing in front of their hall\" and even \"in some cases [of refusing] to notice a neutral classmate whom th ey may chance to meet after eight o'clock of a Thursday evening.\" Such items of ritual, inasmuch as they related spec ifically to society parapher- nalia, might not have been deemed offensive by the \"neutrals\" of the College and might have been without harmful results had they be en restricted at this point. But once embarked upon, the habit of flaunting thei r special position in the face of the College grew upon the society men of success ive classes like the growing hold of the drug habit. 489"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWEREUL S ECRET S OCIETY In 1867 an all-time \"high\" for the period up to 187 0 had been reached. In that year the College, which was apparently not too much concerned over bad manners on the part of senior society men where the ir pins and buildings were concerned, was distinctly shocked. We know one of t he causes. \"Two Bones men,\" we read, \"brought from their meeting a sick c lassmate and put him to bed in his room, without paying any attention to hi s neutral chum who was there present, though he was also a classmate with whom they were on friendly terms.\" But there must have been other incidents wh ich have not come down to us, for the young author of Four Years at Yale, an undergraduate at this time, speaks of \"exaggerated secrecy\" as \"a modern outgro wth,\" and refers to 1867 as the year of its \"highest pitch.\" He indicates clear ly that the College did not take it lying down and that as a result of the furore th e senior society men thereafter \"conducted themselves much more sensibly.\" But this temporary recession of the tide was to be followed by new \"highest pitches.\" It is easy to imagine the process, for ri tual is a coral growth: new cer- emonies are added, but few are ever cut away. With the intense rivalry that existed between Skull and Bones and Scroll and Key the inve ntive genius of the imma- ture youngesters[sic] of the successive delegations must have been continuously at work. They took what they found after their elec tion and then, consciously and unconsciously, set about devising new ways and means of impressing the underclassmen. They invented new taboos to emphasiz e a superiority they may- or may not have felt at first. Later, by a boomeran g effect, the taboos became hourly proof of an existing superiority, till it ca me to be believed. Ultimately, they and all those with whom they came in contact w ere unhappily aware of a chasm between the \"elect\" and the \"non-elect.\" The proof of the process is partly illustrated by a story appearing in an 1890 Buffalo, New York, newspaper. The story contains no hint as to the date of the incident, though it is evidently ancient history. I t may be apocryphal. It is illumi- nating, nevertheless. As in the 1867 incident a mem ber of Skull and Bones was lying sick in his room at the hour of the regular T hursday evening meeting. His \"neutral\" roommate was in attendance. Members of Sk ull and Bones made their appearance; but this time their care and attention was not limited to a putting to bed and a departure. The technique had become en larged. In one-hour shifts the members of the delegation came to sit by the si ck man's bed. They ignored the roommate completely and their relation with the ir brother member was that of the deaf and dumb. This particular story ended happily. After the seco nd visitation the room- mate bolted the door and stoutly informed the next arrival that no deaf-mutes need apply.

Each \"highest pitch\" on the part of the society men was met by a correspond- ing \"highest pitch\" counter-activity on the part of the enemy, this activity taking on forms ranging from cat-calls and physical violen ce to diatribes in anonymous pamphlets and bitter complainings in such College p ublications as might by chance become available. An entirely unofficial institution, first known as \"Bowl and Stones\" and later as \"Bull and Stones,\" was the rallying ground for t he attacks. Four Years at Yale gives us the picture for the years 1865-1869. \"It i s in senior year alone,\" says its author, \"that the neutrals largely outnumber th e society men, that they have nothing to hope for in the way of class elections, and that they are not overawed by the presence of the upper-class men. These circu mstances combine to foster in some of them a sort of reckless hostility toward these societies. ... It was in the class of '66 that this hostility first definitely d isplayed itself, in the institution of a sort of mock 'society' called 'Bowl and Stones\" the name being a take-off on that of Bones, and the duties of its members being simpl y to range about the colleges at a late hour on Thursday night, or early on Frida y morning when the senior societies disbanded, singing songs in ridicule of t he latter, blocking up the entries, and making a general uproar. The refrain of one son g, to the tune of'Bonnie Blue Flag,' was 'Hurrah! Hurrah! for jolly Bowl and Ston es'; of another to the tune of 'Babylon,' 'Haughty Bones is fallen, and we gwine d own to occupy the skull.' ... In the class of '67 they were at their worst, a nd wantonly smashed bottles of ink upon the front of Bones hall and tore the chain s from its fence.\" By the early 1870's \"Bowl and Stones\" had become \"B ull and Stones,\" a well established institution occupying a definite and pe rmanent place in the minds of the undergraduate \"neutrals\" and the object of c onstant comment by them.

Before even Hasty Pudding or Phi Beta K appa were thought of, this fraternity could number its years by the score. Bul l and Stones was founded Commencement Day, 1776, by the Rev. Elisha Williams , Rector of Yale Col- lege, Ezra Stiles, Jeremiah Day (both Presidents of the University), the Governor of the State, and other prominent men.... I t s hall is — no one knows where. However, there is a rumor current that the elected from '76 are to build a fine new hall on Hillhouse Avenue.\" In one class the \"neutrals\" went so far \"as to proc ure a small gilt representation of 'a bull' standing upon 'stones,' which was worn ... even in public ... during the first term of their senior year.\" And in very close proportion to the widening of the taboos by the society men, the activities of the \"Bull and Stones\" men gr ew more and more violent and spread deeper and deeper among the \"neutrals\" o f all classes. The Yale News had not been founded in those days, a nd even if it had been it is to be doubted in view of its subsequent history whether it would have encour- aged or even permitted editorials or communications on such a hush subject as the senior societies. The Yale Courant had re-acqui red independent existence as an undergraduate organ in 1870; but a search in the un-indexed volumes prior to 1874-75 fails to disclose any editorial, communi cation or news article, or even a list of members elected, where the senior societi es are concerned. And after the 1864 attack upon Skull and Bones in The Yale Litera ry Magazine (via the leader \"Collegial Ingenuity\") had resulted in the violent war between the \"neutral\" editors and the Skull and Bones editors on the Board, and i n the formation the same year of the unhappy \"Diggers\" society, \"Spade and Grave, \" the pages of this aristocrat of the College papers were closed forever to \"Bull and Stones\" material. The discontented of the College who were not satisf ied with \"direct action\" but needed the printed word for the release of thei r emotions, were driven, therefore, to publications of their own creating. E ven more than the \"physical\" violences which they often chronicled, the ideas ex pressed in these publications were effective in crystalizing[sic] and perpetuatin g from one class to another the antagonism to the societies and their methods. The one and only issue of the Iconoclast, which mus t have startled the College when it was put on sale on October 13, 1873, was fr ankly directed against Skull and Bones. \"Our object,\" said the editors, \"is to v entilate a few facts concerning 'Skull and Bones,' to dissipate the awe and reveren ce which has of late years en- shrouded this order of Poppy Cock. ... Our reason f or doing this, is ... because we believe that Skull and Bones, directly and indir ectly, is the bane of Yale Col- lege. .. .We speak through a new publication, becau se the college press is closed to those who dare to openly mention 'Bones.'\" The eight pages were full of a variety of charges.

The vehicle was another private publication, a pamp hlet printed in the guise of an issue of the Yale Literary Magazine and identica l with it in general appearance, except that the dignified and bewigged head of Sain t Elihu Yale, and his feet, legs and knee breeches, were replaced by the correspondi ng members of a lowly bull, the cloven hoofs resting upon a floor of cannon-bal l-like stones. The title gave the tone of the whole: Seventh Book of Genesis, otherwise know as the Gospel according to Scrohleankee. It is recorde d by the Naughty-Gal All-Man-Ax, for 1875, that it was written \"by a sophomore in reveng e for having some of his memo- rabilia appropriated by one of the college societie s.\" It is dated February 1874. The author set forth, first, the alleged state of m ind of the men who founded Scroll and Key in 1841. \"Wherefore do they of Pscul lenbohnes,\" the founders were made to say, \"for a space of nine years set th emselves up for us to bow down before and worship? Behold, they are no better than we. Go to now, let us congregate together to make unto ourselves a graven image and a great mystery. Let it be called Scrohleankee. And let us afterward take unto ourselves from Phortietoo such of them as are to be saved like unt o ourselves. Also let Phortietoo dososummore unto Phortiethrie and so on until perch ance by doing sosummore we may rival our enemy, even Pscullenbohnes.\" \"And, \" said the chronicle, they did sosummore.\" The pamphlet then sketched, in an irreverent manner , the progress of \"Keeze\" down to the year 1872, \"when one Noah, surnamed Poh rturr, was King\" and the freshman \"Klasuv Psevventie Psyx journed that w ay\" and, having become sophomores, beheld \"the foolishness and thomfooller rie of the mysterie of the great Poppiekock,\" and how \"very many of the lesser tribes not yet within reach of the Gospel of Dososummore ... cast to the dogs t heir natural rights and grov- eled upon their bellies in the dust, that, peradven ture, they might be accepted.\" It told how \"a Nootrahl, bold and skillful, did fas ten a banner by night from the top of the chief synagogue of the land ... and on it was written in symboli- cal characters, Death to Pschullenbohnes\"; how a ce rtain sophomore, \"named Arayjay,\" brought down the flag and \"loaned it ... to a Nootrahl to keep till Xmas for an altar cloth when offering burnt offerin gs to Bullensthone his god\"; how Scrohleankee\" stole the flag from the \"neutral' s room; how in revenge the \"Nootrahls congregated 'round about the new taberna cle [the recently completed Scroll and Key tomb], reviling Keeze and singing th eir hymns of sacrifice\"; and how \"Scrohleankee [did] wax exceeding wroth, and wo uld have gone forth and slain all, but they could not.\" The story then passed to Arayjay who \"vexed over th e loss of his flag ... cast about him what he might do.\" It told how \"he spake thus within himself: ... 'I 494"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"T HE F OUNDING OF W OLF ' S H EAD will wear their pihn; yea, verily, the golden image which they worship.' ... And he did so ... and ... the Keeze men were black with rage ... Howbeit, they did not touch him for fear of his Klasmaytes.\" Finally it was told how certain men of the class of \"Psevventie Psyx,\" \"about the fourth w atch... gathered up their loins, and taking their pots came unto Keeze Hall... and b ehold, they wrote upon the door, in large characters, PSEWENTIE PSYX. Then did they hastily depart... and when the Keeze men saw what was done, their fur y surpassed the rage of a mad cow in her wildest cavortings ... and they he ld Arayjay in suspicion and would have crucified him, but they could not.\" The tale ended with a parable of a ram with two hor ns, attacked by a he-goat with one horn, who smote the ram and broke both hor ns; and the parable was thus interpreted: \"The ram with the two horns is Sc rohleankee. The horns .. .are the Gospel of Dusosummore, and the doctrine of the Great Poppiekock .... The he-goat ... is Psewentie Psyx ... and the rest of the prophecy showeth the hostility of Psewentie Psyx to Scrohleankee with it s Dusosummore and its Pop- piekock, and the manner in which Psewentie Psyx wil l destroy Scrohleankee and exterminate it utterly.\" A few months before the Seventh Book of Genesis, an other pamphlet had ap- peared, The Yale Literary Chronicle. The covers of the two are identical, except in color, and they are probably by the same author, for the Chronicle couches its main story in the peculiar language which was broug ht to such perfection in the Seventh Genesis. It celebrated, among other things, the \"many jokes and tricks ... the Bullenstohnes men [did] play upon the Chose n-phew\" and especially how \"they did fall upon the chariot [carrying \"to the B ohns men their provender\"] ... and ... did seize the food ... and that night the P scullenbohns men went hungry to bed \" — a tale reminiscent of the incident relat ed in Four Years at Yale: \"The Stones men seized upon and confiscated for their ow n use the ice-cream and other good things which the confectioner was engaged in t aking into Bones hall.\" The year of the Iconoclast and the Scroll and Key w ar was memorable, however, for another event. In May of 1874, the Yale Courant, fo r the first discovered time, opened its editorial and news columns to discussion and ne ws of the senior societies. \"It would be an unpardonable oversight,\" said the i ssue of May 23d,\" to pass without notice ... an event which occupies so much of the attention and interest of the college world as the announcement of electio ns to Senior societies.\" And the elections were not only announced and Tap Day d escribed in detail, but the Courant embarked on a long editorial discussion of the evils of the system, par- ticularly its creation of the politician type among the undergraduates, and closed with the bold words: \"May the time soon come when Y ale shall be delivered of them [the politicians] and of the system which has produced them.\" Such outspokenness may have accounted in part for t he quietness of the next college year. When Tap Day was approaching in May, 1875, and the Courant was once more launching its editorials, it was able to say: \"The Senior society men of '75 have, as a general thing, conducted themselves in a non-offensive manner; 495"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY a great deal of that ostentatious 'poppicock' which caused so much trouble with '74 has not been put on; in fact, the way in which they have acted throughout the year has led us to the belief that a wise choic e [in the coming elections] is to be made.\" But a warning was issued. \"However,\" said the Courant, \"whether the following year is to be a quiet one or a season of Iconoclasts, bogus pins, bum thieving, etc., rests entirely with the Society men of the Senior class, and it is to be hoped that they are fully alive to the fact.\" When Tap Day was over the Courant was not satisfied and said so. The elections, on the whole, were properly given, it thought, but one man was left out of Skull and Bones \"for no other earthly reason than a petty personal dislike.\" \"That is the sentiment,\" said the Courant, \"of the majority of m en in the College\"; and there was no lack of frankness in the Courant's opinion o f such an act. In addition there were three surprises in the elections to Scroll and Key, and while not finding fault with the men taken in, the Courant was troubled abo ut the men omitted. \" There has been some talk,\" it remarked, \"about setting Sp ade and Grave on its legs again and we think that it would be a desirable thing if it could possibly be done ... a third society is really needed in Senior year. Of c ourse it would be difficult to start such a society, but it would surely be a success in the end, provided however, that it was a respectable organization, and not got toge ther to 'grind' the other two.\" Most illuminating of all was the Courant's news-sto ry of Tap Day itself. \"It has been handed down by tradition that Senior election night is a legitimate time for the non-society men of the Senior and junior classes to range around Bones' Hall, and make as much disturbance and trouble as possible, and th en to howl, in the college yard for the rest of the evening, the praises of Bull and St ones, interfering with the society men as they give out elections, rushing them round the campus, locking them up in the entries and building bonfires.... But this year mat ters have been different.... Instead of congregating around Bones' Hall and making the welk in ring there, the crowd thronged the yard between Farnam and Durfee, eagerly compari ng notes as the elections were given out, passing a few remarks upon the general m ake-up of some well-dressed Keys man, and rushing round to congratulate the fortunat e or to sympathize with others. As the Bones' men went around they greeted salutati ons from the crowd with good natured grins, once or twice answering back in a jo king way; a thing never before done and which materially assisted in repressing any ten dency to rowdyism.\" The Courant closed its year with another editorial: \"The organizations in question propose to take in only the 'cream' of the class, and when the best part of that ingredient is left out, what else can be ex pected than adverse criticism?\" It also printed at Commencement time a communicatio n from a graduate of '69. \"Well, really,\" asks E. P. W, the graduate, \"h as the writer [of the Courant's first editorial after Tap Day] come to regard an el ection to a society as one of the prizes?... The Alumni do not so regard it. .. .\"And at the same time the Courant, not to be found in support of such a system, answer ed: \"The writer has mistaken us entirely. We never said that it was an honor to receive a Senior election. What we did say, was that it is considered an honor....' \" (Italics theirs.) 496"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"T HE F OUNDING OF W OLF ' S H EAD But such frankness could not last. In the College y ear 1875-76, the Courant was once more feeding the College on a milk and wat er diet. There is an edito- rial on the society system, but the high point of c riticism was that the evils were known and felt in every class. The news-story was a conventional, a fine time was had by all, and the results of the elections were \" anticipated and satisfactory to the crowd and to the class.\" In 1877 and 1878 reference had dwindled to a mere list of names. In 1879 even the lists had disappeared, r eappearing in 1880 and 1881 and vanishing again in 1882. Courant men, strictly \"neutrals\" before 1880, began in that year to receive elections: one member of th e board to Skull and Bones in each of the years 1880 and 1882, and one member to Scroll and Key in 1881. One suspects a Machiavellian technique for the muzz ling of the College press. At all events, with the first return to milk and wa ter in 1876 whether by coinci- dence or something more, the \"Bull and Stones\" viol ences returned. In 1870 the author of Four Years at Yale had writte n with a measure of pride and a larger measure of foreboding: \"Not yet do the y [the \"Bull and Stones\" men] ever attempt to break into the halls of the [s enior societies].\" But among the memorabilia of the year 1876-77, we find a smal l brown pamphlet bearing the title: \"The Fall of Skull and Bones, compiled f rom the minutes of the 76th regular meeting of the Order of the File and Claw. \"It is d ated 1876, and tells the story of an alleged breaking into the Skull and Bones tomb, \"File and Claw\" being obvi- ously another manifestation of the chameleon, \"Bull and Stones.\" \"Anyone who was noticing the Bones men of 77,\" the pamphlet begins, \"on the morning of Sunday, October 1 st, 1876, was prob ably struck by the crest-fallen air which characterized all of them. ... The reason for this is a simple one. As long as Skull and Bones Society shall exist, the ni ght of September 29th will be to its members the anniversary of the occasion when their Temple was invaded by neutrals, some of their rarest memorabilia confi scated, and their most sacred secrets unveiled to the vulgar eyes of the uninitia ted.\" It may have been on this occasion that the theft re ported in The New Haven Register ion March 7, 1887, occurred, for dates mea nt as little to newspapers then as now. \"The original by-laws of the Russell Trust association,'\" says the Register, \"... were stolen from the temple on High Street by a sorehead student in 1872 or \"73, who had failed to get into the society itself, but did succeed in getting into the building through the roof and then making away with the by-laws.\" The pamphlet says nothing about by-laws. It deals f irst with the details of the fortifications of the Eulogian Temple.\" \"The back-cellar windows,\" it says, \"were fortified as follows: First... was a row of one-inch iron bars; behind them a strong iron ne tting fastened to a wooden frame; behind this another row of iron bars, one an d one quarter inches thick; and still behind this a heavy wooden shutter.\" It then proceeds to the tale of the breaking-the ou tside bars cut \"only after many hours of patient and cautious labor\"; the long nails in the iron netting drawn \"by means of a powerful claw\"; the brick \"dam p-wall\" dug away with a 497"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET Society claw and hatchet; and the building entered \"at just half-past ten o'clock\" on the night of Friday, September 29th. The Skull and Bones tomb is described floor by floo r and room by room, the invaders having discovered, in essence, nothing whi ch they might not have known or guessed before; but \"for the benefit of future e xplorers, and as a directory for new-fledged Bones men for all time,\" they give the description and include de- tailed floor plans. The narrative is in all ways un interesting. It is only important in that it is the first recorded breaking into a se nior society building and that the note upon which it ends — a sincere, if slightly bo mbastic note-fits so accurately with all else that is known of the thoughts and act ivities of \"neutrals.\" \"Before leaving the hall,\" the author says, \"it was asked whether we should inform other members of the college of what we had done, and throw open the hall to the public. We think no one will deny that we had it in our power at one stroke not only to take away forever all the presti ge which her supposed secrecy has given this society, but to make her the laughin g-stock of all college, and render her future existence extremely doubtful. But while we had no consider- ation for the mysterious poppiecock of Skull and Bo nes Society, we nevertheless remembered that some of the Bones men of '77 are ou r warm personal friends, and therefore we preferred a less radical course. T o Bones as a pleasant convivial club, we have no objections. Let her live on as lon g as men enjoy good suppers and quiet whist. But her mystery and her secrecy ar e at an end, and we hope her absurd pretensions and her poppiecock are dead also .\" T HE C HANGING C OLLEGE AND THE G OD C HALLENGED ___________________________ HROUGH all these years one can detect a distinct ch ange taking place in the College, fostered by the faculty, but respon ded to readily by the undergraduates. Yale College was growing up, \"hallo wed institutions\" were being abolished right and left and among them, in 1875, t he two sophomore societies, Beta Xi and Theta Psi. Their abolition had been mooted for a long time, th e faculty merely waiting for the proper moment and excuse. It came on Monday , May 24, 1875, a few days before that so-peaceful Tap Day of the year after t he Scroll and Key \"memorabil\" war, though just what happened is not clear. The Co urant said of the recently tapped senior society members: \"The newly elected w ere requested to remain in their rooms all night, probably to prevent any poss ible repetition of Monday night's scene\"; and added, \"It was no use, no one stayed in ; but everyone kept sober.\" The Courant also, in announcing that the freshmen h ad been notified by their division officers not to be initiated into sophomor e societies until further notice, said: \"Last Monday's spree ... was the last straw t hat broke the camel's back.\" The burial of the societies was as tumultuous as th eir lives. Both halls were raided by undergraduates and the appurtenances-\" hy mn books, the archives, the old Sigma Phi curtain, the ballot box, posters and pictures \" — carried off as \"memorabil'.\" Most bemourned was the Theta Psi r aven \"imported from 498 T"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"T HE F OUNDING OF W OLF ' S H EAD England and ... valued at fifty dollars.\" The theft s were charged to the senior societies — to Scroll and Key, \"that society having an unsavory reputation in regard to memorabil' thieving\"; to Skull and Bones, \"as a prominent Bones man was seen going up there Wednesday evening\" and two Bones men were caught \"at the doors of Theta Psi Thursday morning, and im mediately ran away upon the approach of the Sophomores.\" But significant of the changing times, no one mourn ed the demise of the organiza- tions. \"Talk of the Faculty disbanding them has bee n rife at frequent periods,\" wrote the Courant,\" it is probably done for a good reason . ... The majority of thinking men in college will not be sorry for this action of the Faculty.\" The horseplay and general disorder they bred was becoming, intellectu ally at least, unfashionable. Five years later when the Founders of Wolf's Head f rom the class of '84 had barely settled themselves in New Haven as freshmen \"on probation,\" the fresh- men societies, Delta Kappa and Sigma Epps, met a si milar fate. Like the sophomore societies these freshmen organiz ations had been notorious for years as riot breeders and wasters of time. The aut hor of Four Years at Yale gives us the picture in a description that still applied in 1880 : \"When 'the candidate for admis- sion to the freshman class in Yale College' draws n ear to New Haven,\" he says, \"he is usually accosted with the utmost politeness by a ja unty young gentleman, resplendent with mystic insignia. ...\" The \"jaunty young gentle man\" then attempted to pledge the sub-freshman to his society, which might be Sig ma Epps, Delta Kappa or Gamma Nu. On arriving at New Haven the sub-freshman was s urrounded by society runners. \"At a sign from the first,\" the account continues, it one takes his valise, another his umbrella, a third his bundle. ... And before the su b-Fresh has time to protest, he is rolling along in a hack, and his new found friends are enquiring the number of his boarding house. ... Sometimes the transfer to the h ack is not so easily accomplished, for the runners of another society may scent the pr ey, rush for it, and bear it off in triumph. There are plenty of representatives from a ll three societies hanging about the railroad station. ... They jump upon the platforms of the moving cars, they fight the brakemen, they incommode the travelers, they defy t he policemen, — but they will offer the advantages of 'the best freshman society' to every individual 'candidate.'\" This picture is supplemented by the Yale Courant, a lready, in 1872, forecasting the abolition of these societies: \"If they [the fre shmen society runners] do their duty as we used to do it, they must visit the depot twenty-three times a day, besides attending to the morning and night boat.\" (Italics ours.) Quite apart from all this local disorder, the vast campaign machinery that had been built up was an impossible drain on studen t time and money. \"I was pledged while at Williston,\" writes Francis Bartlet t Kellogg, Founder, Of '83, of his freshman society experience; and this was merel y typical of the general policy of sending emissaries broadcast to the prep, school s just before Commencement to pledge members — often futily and foolishly, for we have a record that, in 1880, representatives of Gamma NO were sent to the Hartfo rd High School and there pledged all the members of the graduating class alt hough none of them came to Yale or, it seems, had any prospect of coming. 499"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & Bones - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET Society In addition, as had been the case with the sophomor e societies, the freshman initiations, pea-nut bums, and purposeless meetings and politics were seats of continuous disorder. The excuse to disband them appeared at the freshman initiations of 18 So. These ceremonies were held in the middle of the Gar field-Hancock presiden- tial campaign, and presidential campaigns of that d ay were as immature as the horseplay of the undergraduates. Yale was largely R epublican. The Democratic candidates were apparently associated in Republican minds with the rebels of the Civil War. Organization for the campaign was not ca sual, as witness the notice in the Yale News: 'Order No. 2. The University Garfiel d and Arthur Regiment will meet for company drill at 9:30 A.M. Saturday.\" And by a stroke of fate the hall of the Jeffersonian Club, boosters of General Hanco ck, was just across the street from the initiation hall of Sigma Epps; and between the two halls was hung a \"flag of the union with Hancock's name across its s acred folds.\" The inevitable happened. \"The initiation,\" writes F rank Kellogg, \"turned out to be an historical event. It rang down the curtain for the freshmen societies Incidentally, being tossed in a blanket is rather e xhilarating. The grand climax, however, came with the discovery of a rope tied to a bar across one of the front windows. Investigation disclosed that the rope exte nded across Chapel Street and that from it, in mid-street, hung a large American flag with the words 'Hancock and English' emblazoned upon it. These were the Dem ocratic candidates for President and Vice President. Political stupidity h ad anchored that rope within reach of student hands which were promptly in actio n. The flag was quickly hauled in and as quickly torn into a thousand piece s, henceforth to function as memorabilia of a momentous occasion.\" This act, coming when the New Haven political blood was hot, assumed major political proportions. A despicable outrage, cried the New Haven Register, Democratic. Give us the sacred pieces, shouted the Jeffersonian Club. It wa s an unpardonable act, said the Yale News calmly, but stop making political capital out of what was simply the act of a few rowdy Sophs at a freshman initiation. Not rowdy Sophs — upperclass- men, protested \"Justice\" in a communication to the News. And committees from the College waited on the Jeffersonian Club with ap ologies and offers of cash payment. The Register then acquired-feloniously acc ording to the News the Sigma Epps constitution, publishing it in full. Dastardly , thieving act, howled the News, and a secret society tool The Jeffersonian Club, ha ving turned down the cash of- fer and still crying for the \"sacred pieces,\" waite d surreptitiously upon President Porter and demanded-of all things-money, which comm odity \"peace-loving\" President Porter dug out of his own pocket to quell the uproar-one hundred and two dollars and some cents. The entire College was furious at this traitorous act of the \"rebs\" Then the campaign ended; and with the approval \"of all thinking men\" the freshman societies were abolished forever. That is, Delta Kappa and Sigma Epps were abolished. Gamma Nu, the third freshman society, and as far as can be learned, qui te as much involved as the 500 "},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"T HE F OUNDING OF W OLF ' S H EAD other two in the evils of campaigning, was permitte d to survive. But Gamma Nu was a \"reform\" society. Its founders had suffere d \"the fate of all reformers ... despised, derided and abused.\" Gamma Nu men, by and large, were \"harder workers, and in proportion to their numbers ... [se cured] a far larger share of the substantial college awards.\" Even in 1870 Ga mma Nu \"was sometimes favored ... [by the faculty] as against the others. \" But most important of all, Gamma Nu was an open society-not exactly an open cl ub, the ideal of the College \"neutrals\"!—but still not a typical \"Yale s ecret society.\" Its survival was a symptom of the times. Two other \"immemorial traditions\" were sacrificed i n this period to die eradica- tion of immaturity: the Thanksgiving jubilee, a mor e than usually riotous affair frequently censored by the faculty, and the custom of the senior societies of giving their elections in the rooms of the candidates. The Tap Day tradition had already undergone one maj or change. Much ear- lier it had been the rule for all fifteen undergrad uates of each senior society to march in a body to the room of each candidate where the elections were offered, the leader of the group, in the case of Skull and B ones, \"displaying a human skull and bone,\" and in the case of Scroll and Key, in addition to \"the large gilt scroll-and-key\" being borne by the leader, with eac h member carrying \"a key some two feet in length.\" This marching of an army, however, called forth the best efforts of the \"neutrals\" in mass formation. F ree-for-alls in the rooms and entries resulted until, after a period, a major bre ak with tradition was made and the senior society men were sent out one by one, ea ch individual tendering an election to an individual candidate. As we have seen this change had achieved nothing su bstantial and the \"neu- tral \" activities — the catcalls, bonfires and kidn appings — grew burdensome. Daylight and supervision-probably by the faculty — were required. The rites were, therefore, transferred to the Campus, to the corner under the elms next to the Chapel, and the Tap Day known to most living Ya le men and objectionable to so many of them, came into existence. Under the impact of all these abolitions the \"Bull and Stones\" violences dwindled. We know that the breaking into Skull and Bones —\" t his unprecedented vandalism \" — was followed \"in 1878, by another set of maraud ers defacing with paint both Senior buildings,\" that \"the offenders were tried i n the City Court\" and that they \"escaped free of fine or imprisonment, through tech nicalities.\" We know, too, that in the same year, probably as a part of this same a nti-society wave, a supplement to the Yale Year Book was devoted in part to a cut of the Keys scroll, with key-crossing, sealed with the \"Great Seal\" — the fox and grapes v iew — and bearing the legend, obviously an imitation of the Banger burlesque alre ady referred to: \"Declaration of Imbecility and Rejection of Skull and Bones.\" Th e accompanying letter-press reads: \"The club occupying the so-called striped ze bra Billiard Hall ... after act- ing in the most unaccountable, ungentlemanly and un derhand way during the past year, decided not to permit their cut to be us ed by anything except their own masterpieces of publications as the Yale Index....

Index.\" (Itali cs, etc., in the original.) But after 1878 there seems to have been a cessation of physical violences and less of the old childish forms of attack. \"What were the 'Bull and Stones' activities in your time?\" was the question put in the recent questionnaire to the living members o f the first three delegations to Wolf's Head who, together, cover the college genera tion, 1879-1885. \"None,\" is the substance of the statements of the nine men who answered: Frank Bartlett Kellogg and Frank Cunningham; Founders, of '83; Fra nklin Davis Bowen, Henry Raup Wagner and Harry Augustus Worcester, Founders, of '84; and Albert Heman Ely, Lafayette Blanchard Gleason, William Procter M orrison and William T. G. Weymouth, of '85; either by direct statement, or in directly by failing to answer the question. Weymouth says, \"I hardly remember the name,\" and Gleason adds, \"Not until the meeting of the Senior class in 1884. \" This does not mean, however, that the \"poppycock\" o f the society men had di- minished in intensity or scope or that the College had grown reconciled to it. We read in the New Haven press of those days of an operation in Bridgeport, Connecticut, upon a Skull and Bones man in a very s erious condition after having swallowed his society pin: humorous, if it w ere not so sad; and Frank Kellogg writes: \"I recall a prank of Sophomore year. The D'Oyly Car te Musical Comedy Company gave 'The Pirates of Penzance' in New Haven . The pirate king wore a Napoleon hat with a skull and cross bones emblazo ned on it. I enlisted the co-operation of Ted Buell and Charlie Foote in my p lot and we visited the 'king' at his hotel. We told him that it would make a loca l hit if he would put '322' below the death's head. Then we went to the evening performance and sat in the front row of the balcony. When the 'king' appeared he had the mystic number on the hat all right. \"I don't suppose the singer noticed that several st udents in the audience got up and left the hall. Much less did he know that they were 'Bones' men. However, we did, and got quite a kick out of it, but more es pecially out of the universal grin on the faces of all the other Yale men in the audience.\" But whether these activities and all they typify we re confined to Skull and Bones men, or were affected by Scroll and Key men a s well, and whether by all fifteen men in each society or by a few only, there is no direct evidence to show. Scroll and Key as a rule seemed to confine its unpl easantness to \"memorabil\"' raids and such, leaving to Skull and Bones the deve lopment of \"haughty man- ners.\" In all probability, it was the old story of \"high pitches\" and \"low pitches,\" for we know that the society men of '82, like their predecessors of a few classes after the \"highest pitch\" of 1867, conducted themse lves \" more sensibly\" That there was an immediate reaction is proven by the ti dal wave of antagonism that threatened to overwhelm the societies in 1883 and 1 884. The forerunner of this wave was a \" daily anti-seni or society newspaper ... vigorously conducted so as to thwart the society me n in every way.\" No copy of 502"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"T HE F OUNDING OF W OLF ' S H EAD this publication has been discovered; but the fact that it was issued daily proves that its attack was, like that of the Iconoclast, g eneral and not specific, and that the antagonism behind it unlike the quickly release d antagonisms of the Icono- clast, the Seventh Book of Genesis and the Fall of Skull and Bones, was something functioning twenty-four hours a day. The wave itself, however, was characterized by a re bellion in the ranks of the senior societies themselves, as is evidenced by an \" elaborate pamphlet from a man who had belonged to the societies from e ach year, from first to last,\" and who, in spite of these affiliations, \" s ought to prove that the whole system was pernicious and should be abolished.\" Thi s was alarming enough, but worse followed. The crusade against the societi es, until then confined to the Campus activities of the \"Bull and Stones\" m en and the presenta- tion of views in special publications of limited ci rculation, spread violently outward and \"was transferred to the columns of prom inent metropolitan journals.\" The alumni bodies were infected: \" alumn us and undergraduate emulated each other in striving to point out the en ormities committed by the societies,\" and before the astonished eyes of t he world-at-large, and aided and abetted by editors forever welcoming dissension at Yale to increase their circulation, \"the good name of the University ... [ was) dragged through the mire by her own sons.\" The situation affected all Yale men, but from the p oint of view of the harassed societies the immediate danger lay in the fact that the attacks upon them had lost their informal and indirect characteristics. A few isolated expressions of adverse opinion could be ignored by the Yale authorities as unrepresentative. \"Bull and Stones\" physical violences could be cried down as i mmature horseplay of un- dergraduates and counter-attacked as clean-cut viol ations of law. But when \"the faculty and corporation were directly appealed to\" by the enemies of the system, then the situation was obviously out of hand. It wa s entirely possible that, legally and drastically approached, the faculty and corpora tion would be driven into legal and drastic action. We have this general picture on the unimpeachable a uthority of John Addison Porter, prominent Yale and Scroll and Key man, in h is article in the New Eng- lander for May, 1884, \"The Society System of Yale C ollege.\" It is to be gathered directly from what he says and indirectly from what he implies. The vital nature of the question is to be read in his choice of vehi cle: a publication traditionally devoted to Yale matters of the highest importance. The quality of the danger appears in his statement that whereas \"the societie s have never yet: been forced to ... offer explanations to their assailants, and it is extremely improbable that they will ever condescend to do so,\" nevertheless t he occasion has now arisen \"for plain words between man and man ... the time for de lay, for allowing things to 'adjust' themselves, would appear to have passed.\" \"Whether the Yale Societies are guilty or not of th e charges made against them,\" says Mr. Porter,\" is not the first question. ...

The immediate cause for the publication of this art icle was the direct, open and organized attempt, on February 1, 1884, to kill or cure the diseased society \"pyramid\" by the amputation of its senior society t op-knot. Said The New Haven Register, in 1887, \"In 1884 ... opposition to 'popp ycock' ... was at its height\"; and The New York Tribune, in 1896, \"From time to ti me the opposition to the senior society system takes organized form, but per haps the most vigorous attack ... was made by the class of 1884\" The wave was breaking. The senior class had met, according to custom, for the election of its class day committees: Promenade, Class Supper, Class Day, Cla ss Cup, Ivy, and the election of a Class Secretary. Well beforehand, however, it had become known that after the transaction of this business, a resolution agai nst the senior societies would be introduced. \"[The movement] was fostered and con ducted,\" writes Lafayette Gleason, \"by William McMurtrie Speer, afterwards pr ominent in newspaper and legal circles in New York\"; and Speer had done a th orough job. \"The supporters of this motion entered the meeting confident of the ir ability to put it through,\" the Yale News says, and this is confirmed by the st atement of the Horoscope of a year later: \"There were a sufficient number who h ad promised to vote for it to make it a success.\" The society men were genuinely alarmed. One more \"a bolition\" in a season of \"abolitions\" was entirely within the bounds of p ossibility. They themselves conducted a counter-canvass of the class insofar as their policy of never conde- scending to face an opponent man to man would permi t them; but this policy had them at a distinct disadvantage. The mathematic s of the meeting disclose two illuminating possibilities. There were 151 men in the senior class. 117 of these voted \"yea\" or \"nay\" on the anti-society moti on. 117 Plus 30 equals 147. Allowing for a few natural absences, the conclusion is inevitable either that not a single member of Skull and Bones or Scroll and Key was present at the meeting or that, being present, they were too proud to vote . In either event, they were forced to rely on such allies as could be induced t o support them. The Class Day officers were duly elected, among the m a number of the men to be found among the Founders of Wolf's Head: Charles Walker, William Bristow 505"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY and Charles Phelps, to the Promenade Committee of n ine; William Holliday, Harry Worcester, Harry Wagner, and James Dawson, to the Class Supper Com- mittee of five; Edwin Merritt, Henry Cromwell and S idney Hopkins to the Class Cup Committee of three. \"The way was now clear,\" says the Yale News, for Mr . Speer to introduce the fol- lowing resolution, which the meeting had declined t o receive before, prefering[sic] to postpone its discussion until all other business had been transacted: \"WHEREAS, The present senior society system creates a social aristocracy, exercises an undue influence in college politics, f osters a truckling and cowering disposition among the lower classes, creates dissen sions and enmities in every class, alienates the affections of the graduates fr om the college, stifles the full expression of college sentiment by its control of t he college press. \"Resolved, That we believe this system detrimental to the best interest of Yale College and injurious to, ourselves. That we reques t the college press to publish this resolution of the senior class. That the chair man and two others, to be ap- pointed by him, be a committee of three to lay this resolution before the president, faculty and members of the corporation.\" Debate then followed, but true to the general polic y of suppressing society news and views as far as possible, not a word appea rs in the College press, or elsewhere, of the sentiments expressed. We know onl y the outline of the par- liamentary procedure: that after the resolution had been read, \"Mr. Merritt\" — no other than Edwin Albert Merritt, of '84, a Fou nder of Wolf's Head — demanded that the mover should make known to the me eting his reasons for supporting it. Mr. Speer, thereupon, did so, when M r. Merritt spoke at some length in reply. The debate was continued by Mr. Ki nlay, for the resolution, and Mr. Judson, against.\" Then after some skirmishing — a majority vote to la y on the table having been ruled insufficient by the chair, with a two-th irds vote impossible to secure — the motion was put to a vote. The chair ruled \"th at the voter, on his name being called, could answer from his seat, could whi sper his vote in the ear of the chairman, or could deposit a ballot in the hat at the desk\"; and amid great excitement, 117 men of the senior class, one by one , recorded their vote in these varying fashions. The process was slow, with the ou tcome unrevealed and in doubt. At length all the votes were in and counted. There were 67 \"nays\" and 50 \"yeas.\" \"It is a disgrace to the Yale manhood so often spok en of,\" writes the Horoscope bitterly in 1885, \"that the last graduating class w as unable to pass resolutions condemning the methods of the two eyesores.\" This f rom the \"neutral\" side. On the \"society\" side haste was made to follow up the advantage gained and within a few hours almost, John Addison Porter had been sp urred into the preparation and proposed publication of a \"defense\" of the syst em and was abroad on the Campus collecting his material before worse should happen. The outcome seems to have been a complete surprise both to the two older societies and to the College.

I think that most of our members voted with them.\" Lafayette Gleason says: \" Speer counted upon the votes of Wolf's Head members, as we were supposed t o be organized in opposition to the two societies, but for obvious reasons, such as the Hall being under construction, etc., he did not get those votes.\" The shift of fifteen votes would, of course, have reversed the \"yeas\" and \"nays\" and brought victory to the proponents of the resolution, so that the Founding may be said to be directly responsible for the outcome. But while some of the fifteen Founders must have voted as they did from loyalty to a system of which they were now a part or from a feeling that the system was too entrenched to be affected by a mere vote, nevertheless, from an historical perspective the reason for the defeat appears to lie much deeper. The Founders of the new Society had been, of course , of the great body of the College \"outs.\" For this very reason they had not b een bound by tradition and were able with dear eyes to discern the defects in the e xisting system, and to attempt its cure through the introduction of new and progre ssive elements rather than through the over-drastic process of the axe. Not by accident had they gathered into the platform of their institution the spirit of the ideas expressed over long years by the \"neutrals\" of the College-the spirit of the Courant's description of that one peaceful Tap Day after the bitter Scroll and Key me morabilia war: \"As the Bones men went around they greeted salutations from the c rowd with good-natured grins, once or twice answering back in a joking way ; a thing never before done...\"; 507 "},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET Society the spirit of the Courant's \"third society\" proposa l: \"a respectable organization.. not got together to 'grind 'the other two \"; the sp irit of the constructive elements of the Iconoclast, the Seventh Book of Genesis and the Fall of Skull and Bones. In addition, like the founders of Linonia and Broth ers in Unity, they had embarked upon their venture with something of a cru sading fervor — \" to bring more democracy to the College.\" As a first witness of this, unlike the members of Skull and Bones and Scroll and Key who were skulkin g in their tents — haughtily absent or more haughtily present but not voting — t he fifteen members of the new society were full participants in the meeting with their non-society classmates. It would not have been possible in the course of a bitter and long debate to have kept the basic principles of the founding of t he new Society wholly hid- den. Wolf's Head, at this time, was still without a name; its building was no more than a foundation covered with snow; but its e xistence was known by this time and its membership, in part at least, identifi ed and something of the ideas behind its founding must have percolated into the C ol- lege. When, therefore, Edwin Merritt spoke \"at some length\" in defense of the society system — or more probably in defense of a society system in which a sense of humor would play a large part and \"poppycock\" no ne at all — it is impossible not to believe that he wa s listened to by his classmates with deep interest as the pos- sible prophet of a new order, or that 'votes — whether of some of the Founders or of the \"neutrals\" — previously \"promised\" to Speer were changed under the persuasiveness of the new idea. More than this, the very presence of the members of the new society at the meeting, taking part in the debate and registering their vot es, must have been a happy and effective testimonial of the possibility of a new order.

The mummer's art that so flourished in the universi ties situated in the larger cities had not racked the simple souls of Yale before our day. They had been content to read of lutes trimmed to the beating foot and to im itate in cheers the classic chorus of the frogs. The secret societies, however, had lo ng found amusement in giving on their own hallowed stages plays that were not se riously prepared or skillfully performed, and in our middle years the junior Frate rnities sought the clamor and the glare of the theatre by the public production o f musical comedies, in one of which our classmates appeared as brigands, nymphs, and gallowglasses.

No commentary, however abbreviated, on the life at Yale would be adequate without some allusion to the system of secret socie ties existing there. The estab- lishment of societies is fixed, although they are c ontinually undergoing a series of changes and developments, thereby indicating some d isorder of the social state. When we entered college there were two Sophomore so cieties that kept the entire Class in a state of unrest throughout Freshman year ; their only outward indications being exhibited by machinations in Freshman politic s and by their marching in a body, as of course, into the two larger junior soci eties, Psi Upsilon and Delta Kappa Epsilon. In our junior year a third Sophomore socie ty was started by the members of Ninety-Six, but shortly after our day all these Sophomore societies, having met with a widespread condemnation, were abolished by t he Faculty. At the close of our course Alpha Delta Phi, which h ad been a general four-year society, was made a junior fraternity, resulting in a shifting in the system to overcome the criticism then prevailing. The Senior secret so cieties have continued withour change, except that there is to be recorded the rec ent birth of a non-secret Senior group styled the Elihu Club. The subject of societies is so abundantly, though f urtively, discussed in under- graduate days that any consideration of the various views would perhaps be unwel- come here, and the social problem involved is refer red to only to cut the ten-year notch in our opinions, and to pause, as we reflect once more upon that powerful undercurrent of Yale life, for the observing of the modifications that a decade of experience and of contact with a different communit y have made in us. A comment on the American people has been frequentl y made that they are inor- dinately given to forming a multiplicity of secret orders and associations. Certainly in the colleges this propensity has developed to a high degree, and Yale has indulged in it in due proportion. Secret societies abound, e specially in preparatory schools, where they are subjected to no very intelligent con trol. Boys are entranced by the appeal of mysticism newly awakened in a dawning lif e, and captivated in their un- balanced days by an apparent superiority establishe d by themselves and accepted by the uninitiated. They bring to Yale all the ardor a nd all the undesirable attitudes that school societies can create, and, with the latter, supply to the social life an element that is in constant conflict with more wholesome in fluence. A Yale graduate will be most likely to form an opin ion uncolored by loyalty to his fraternity, or without bias as to the society s ystem, if he calmly considers the characteristics of some outside fraternal order of whatever species of Independent Reindeers it may happen to be. The very fact that h e himself is not a member—as not many college men join in after years such assoc iations—is an expression of his opinion of their allurements; he knows that their s ecrets amount to nothing, that their symbolism is the emptiest kind of trumpery.

He turns again at this extended day to vie w the societies of Alma Mater, to discover, doubtless with some shock of surprise, ho w like in part they are to those fraternal orders viewed with his indulgent eye. Tru e, there is a marked divergence, but on the point of secrecy he finds college men no less ridiculous, except they are not so old and fat. To turn over the pages of the Yale Banner, or any c ollege year book, is to find emblematic engravings of secret orders with smoulde ring sarcophagi, exhaling the odor of mystery, skulls, masks, spades, keys to the secret of knowledge, books of sibylline prophecy, and a host of gewgaws that symb olize the ages of credulity and ignorance. The sacred iron doors at Yale no more cl ose on the world than do the wicker wings of a summer barroom; the societies hav e no secrets, except for the pitiful agreement not to tell the meaning of A.B.C. or the significance of chained hearts and clasped hands. It cannot be denied that a spirit of mysticism, fin ding its only expression in tokens of tragedy and darkness, appeals strongly to all men and especially to the spirited and immature temperament of youths. If Yal e men take a delight in the allurements and romances of the occult, they are to be allowed that liberty, even at the seat of a university, where it is the business of the Faculty to enlighten the blind, and the practice of a student body to seriously adm inister the social law. In general the liberty is harmless, but the spectacle is to be tolerated only where it does not interfere or conflict with the wellbeing of the col lege community. Whether it does so at Yale is the question now raised for our matur er judgments. It has been stated that but few graduates join frat ernal orders. A further reason for this is found in the fact that those orders cannot bestow the favors or inflict the pains that lie in the laps of the college fraternities. I n the world at large we have courts of law to govern the conduct of men, and the requireme nts of the entire community over conduct extend not much beyond the reach of th e penal statutes. For the vast admixture of society there are many standards impos ed on as many classes, among which the fraternal organizations by their paucity in membership are entirely lost, so that a breach of any particular requirement of a fraternal order not correspond- ing with a general rule of conduct of the entire co mmunity will bring no penalty except from the order. One is permitted to observe a march of decorated Templars without much concern for his own welfare, but at Ya le the underclass man lurks to watch a midnight parade as fearful of detection as a Peeping Tom. The college community is quite differently constitu ted from the general, and me system of ethics which prevails richly transcend s that penumbra closely cling- ing to the portals of the jail. Undergraduates come largely from a single stratum of society and respond with almost equal sensitiveness to the praise or blame of their fellow-men. Their numbers are few, all are eligible to the same clubs, and most regard an election as a thing greatly to be desired. The s ecret societies dominate the entire activity of college life, they establish by their e lections a system of rewards that are accepted by the community as the highest gifts that man can have for man, and of punishments whose sting no one is too independent t o ignore or too degraded to 511"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY feel. They establish a morale, their imposition of social regulations is accepted by all, and the violation of their rules brings not on ly the disapproval of the initiated and a failure of election, but shapes the judgment of expectant underclassmen on the propriety of conduct. Whether this situation is deplorable or beneficent is for the moment immaterial; the fact to be noted is that it exists. The government by a tribunal of public opinion, so constituted, exercises a con- trol, powerful, sustained, and complete, over the b ehavior of men from the moment they arrive in New Haven as Freshmen; it is powerfu l only because its standards are high, sustained because it affects a class superior in culture, and complete because it manages men in their most dependent days. This s ystem, unique in its class progression and wholesome in its achievement, is hi ghly valuable. Yet in spite of its wide and efficient control of conduct, and beca use of its great authority, it has established a certain attitude and exercises some r equirements that neither appeal to reason nor freely meet the approval of sober-min ded graduates. It is out of the feature of secrecy that there arises a strong doubt . It has been maintained here that the secret societi es have no substantial secrets, and that their claims of the supernatural or of hid den experience are as unreal as they are pretentious, yet the power and the prestig e they have gained, coupled with the show of secrecy, give birth to a feeling of sup eriority and exclusiveness that quite intoxicates. If men want to feel superior and exclusive, of course they may be allowed the opportunity so to indulge their intelle cts, but when they are the same men whom circumstance has elevated to a position of authority, the maintenance of their attitude may, and in undergraduate days ou ght to be fairly questioned. That the entire system is conducted with a fostered exclusion is beyond doubt; the countless prohibitions that are imposed on non-memb ers is proof enough. The qual- ity of exclusion is displayed not in an aloofness f rom non-members, such conduct could be nicely tolerated, but in a pointed comming ling, a subtle insistence on a difference, and a constant appreciation of a barrie r, perhaps as wilfully raised by the non-member, but certainly the fabric of the oth er. It may be urged that men need not accept these prohibitions, but the college world does submit to them—the worst being a restriction upon free discussion. The decrees of exclusiveness are ad- ministered conjointly with the wholesome rules of c onduct, and most men while willingly submitting to the latter feel hotly the e ffrontery offered in the former, for effrontery and chivalry can be maintained together in any community and they so thrive in Yale's societies. As the secrecy is false , the exclusiveness is manufactured, and as it is manufactured it is offensive. A proper answer is not given if it be said that no man need feel the exclusion unless he choos es to take it as such, for when a condition is ostentatiously created, as this is, and a prohibition against open recognition is decreed, then exclusiveness is delib erately maintained. Objection arises not out of pique at the assumption of the ch osen few but out of the injury submitted to, perhaps weakly, by the uninitiated.

The societies at Yale are essentially clubs for the development of friendships, all have the interest of Yale at heart, and election to their number is an honor not lightly considered and a trust not wilfully violated. Their power is great, their influence inspiring. Without secrecy and the offense growing out of it, these clubs would still maintain their high position and authority, and the y would remove from life at Yale a feature that long has been an object of criticism and regret. While the society system has a strong influence on college social life it is still only an undercurrent above which is a stronger, wider st ream, rich with experience and opportunity from earliest Freshman days. At a casua l glance it seems amazing to think how quickly the members of the Class in Fresh man year came to know each other. An universal intimacy sprang up that finds, as we continually observe, no correspondence in the outside world. Mere boys, shy and diffident, from all corners of the country, made up the membership; they were n ot thrown together by the force of college regulations, but were marshalled i n divisions of thirty or so, and yet in no time they were on terms of Nym and Pistol fro m A to Z. This of course was due to the men coming in groups from the preparator y schools, like Andover and St. Paul's, and lesser institutions, where they liv ed in closest relation. Each group stood practically as a unit, so that to know one me ant immediately to know all. Those who came singly from remotest towns and isola ted high schools soon became attached to and a part of one of the larger groups, with the consequence that from the very start of the course the men gained acquain tances widespread that later were to develop into friendships, fraternities, clubs, a nd carousals.

Athletics and societies are first-rate mediums thro ugh which the pressure of many may cause the individual to modify his peculiaritie s and faults. Four years at New Haven seeing no one but instructors, and devoting t he whole time to study would be less valuable than four years under the present system, with study left out and some regular physical labor substituted as the reas on for our presence,—No, on reading this I convert myself to the contrary. The improvement would not come without the mental activity of study. It is absolut ely essential.\" The chief complaint against athletics is that compa ratively few are encouraged to take part in them. A very common sentiment is ex pressed by the man who says: \"I think athletics should be more generally indulge d in and less attention paid to University teams.\" Although the question does not suggest a criticism of the society system, about 20 men add such criticism. Their replies are mostly to the effect either that societies are very much over-emphasized or that they should be ab olished. Six of them, however, feel that the societies do more good than harm. Of these six men five were in Senior societies. The only Senior society man to criticize the society system stated the fol- lowing: \"I do not think a man should make a Senior society unless he has a junior appointment.\" Of the critics a very few were member s of junior societies. Sentiments expressed are as follows: \"The fetish of Senior soc ieties seems to me wholly bad. Its evil influence penetrates even the lower grades of preparatory schools.\" \"Societies (all of them) root and branch should be abolished.\" \"Societies seem to me of less importance each year.\" These from Junior society me n who did not make a Senior society.

There are three secret societies, Skull and Bones, Scroll and Keys, and Wolf's Head, and it is the ambition of every normal College man to get into one of them.

In so far as I have been able to ascertain them from talk ing with Yale alumni these qualifications may be formulated as two, one passiv e and one active: First conformity; second, achievement. The first requirem ent of eligibility is that the student \"be a gentleman\" according to the preva iling definition of that word; that he be clubbable; that he conform to Yale customs and violate none of its traditions. The second distinguishes the few men of prominence from the crowd of those who are merely negatively eligib le thru conformity with establisht ideals of manners and conduct. A man mus t have done something, particularly something that has brought glory upon the college; he must be a leader among his mates in college activities, such as athletics, journalism, college politics, or religious work. These criteria are on the whole good ones, at least very similar to those that measure a man's success in the outside world, but s ome questions would arise as to their interpretation. Youth is naturally into lerant and exclusive, even, or perhaps especially, college youth, and probably too rigid a conformity is insisted upon and too narrow a definition given to the word \"gentleman.\" Then, too, the activities in which prominence is rewarded are rath er apart from the purposes for which the university exists, and devotion to some o f these activities may easily become so absorbing as to give rise to a general se ntiment that high grades are indicative of a narrow mind. The societies should in my opinion add scholarship to their list of undergradu- ate activities in which a student may legitimately attain distinction, and should take cognizance of the fact that a man who presents an original thesis, who dis- covers a new species of plant or writes a genuine p oem, may be said in a sense to have brought glory upon his university as well as a man who has won a game. That scholarship has very little weight in the ques tion of eligibil- ity to the senior societies was shown by Mr. Mauric e F. Parmelee in the Yale Courant of December, 1906, from which I obtain the following figures: TABLES OF GRADUATES FROM ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT, 1882- 1905 H ONOR MEN % W OLF ' S H EAD 308 19 6.1 S CROLL & K EYS 349 37 10.6 S KULL & B ONES 358 83 23.1 S OCIETY M EN 1,015 139 13.6 N ON -S OCIETY M EN 3,984 967 24.2 T OTAL 4,999 1,106 22.6 516"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"Y ALE U NIVERSITY The \"Honor Men\" are those that have received the hi ghest marks in their classes and are, according to tradition, placed upon the co mmencement program for Philosophical Orations, High Orations and Orations, altho these are not now given. These men also become members of the Phi Beta Kappa , a national non-secret honorary society. The figures show that only one of the three secret senior societ- ies contains a higher percentage of honor men than the College as a whole, and even that society had a less percentage than the st udent body outside. That is, if a blindfolded man had entered the crowd assembled aro und the oak tree near Battell Chapel on the third Thursday in May and tapped fort y-five men at random, the chances are that he would have obtained men of high er standing than those actu- ally chosen, after the long and anxious deliberatio ns of the secret conclaves. Or, in other words, after the forty-five happy men had gone to their rooms there was better picking in the crowd than there was before, so far as scholarship goes. But the faculty estimate of a man's ability based o n grades alone is as narrow as the student estimate based on activities which o ften interfere with the making of high grades. To get some light on this point, I asked seven Yale graduates in classes from 1872 to 1896, to mark in the directory of graduates the names of their classmates who had in some way distinguished themse lves since graduation. No instructions were given as to the degree of promine nce or the proportion of the class to be indicated, but they checked on an avera ge 24 per cent, of the names on their class rolls. On comparing these with the l ists of living graduates in these classes who are members of the three senior societi es and of Phi Beta Kappa (the latter being Honor Men), the following results were obtained: 38 per cent. of the Phi Beta Kappa men became promi nent. 37 Per cent. of the Society men became prominent. 19 per cent. of the men not in Phi Beta Kappa becam e prominent. 18 per cent. of the men not in the societies became prominent. Of course the question of which men in these classe s had shown special ability depended upon the personal judgment of the men mark ing the lists and their knowledge of their classmates and the examination w as not extensive enough to give accurate figures.* [* But two men marking the same class gave practically the same figures.] No allowance can be made for the fac t that the honors conferred upon an undergraduate give him thereafter a certain prominence in the eyes of his classmates and may directly contribute to his s uccess in life. Still we should probably be justified in concluding that the senior societies and the Phi Beta Kappa, tho their standards of judgment are differen t, are equally successful in picking out the men of superior ability and that a student belonging to either of these groups has twice the chance of future prom inence as one belonging to neither. There are several interpretations that mig ht be given to these figures. One is that the importance attached to non-scholastic a ctivities in Yale draws a large proportion of the ablest students away from their u niversity duties. 517"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET Society Most conspicuous of the activities is, of course, a thletics, which at Yale as in all the other American colleges, absorbs too much o f the student's time, energy, ,and enthusiasm. By athletics I do not mean physica l exercise or even sport, for these two desirable elements of student life have b een so overshadowed by other features of the intercollegiate contest system as t o be negligible in the consideration of the question. Whenever the number of spectators exceeds the number of play- ers the limit of true sport has been past, and when the spectators outnumber the players a hundred to one, the game becomes merely a n exhibition. If there were some way by which the strength and agility, or rath er the health and symmetrical development of the entire student body of one unive rsity could be matched against those of another, some good might come of it, but u nder present conditions success in intercollegiate contests does not prove that the winning university is superior to its rival in these important qualities nor does it do much to promote them. Young men got excited enough over their games naturally without outside pressure, and when they know that in every city of the United States crowds art assembled to watch and bet on their feats the press ure is too great. Overstrain, physical and moral, necessarily results, as in the boat race of last June, when, with a President rooting on one side and a future P resident on the other, a Yale student collapsed and has since died and two Harvar d men broke the rules of the university and were expelled. I find that I am expected to say something about de mocracy in this article on Yale. I will therefore take this opportunity of exp laining that I have not been able to find out much about democracy in American univer sities because it means dif- ferent things or takes different forms in the diffe rent institutions I have visited. In Yale, for example, the students resent the introduc tion of valets and automobiles as a menace to democracy. In Princeton the authorit ies regard the use of Greek letters in the name of a club as too dangerous to b e tolerated. In Wisconsin it is thought democracy will be lost if the tickets to th e junior Prom are raised from $3 to $5. In Michigan any system of marking grades except \"passed\" and \"not passed\" is considered undemocratic and it was only this year that that aristocratic institution, the Phi Beta Kappa, was allowed to be establisht. In Harvard the word \"democracy\" seems to mean \"promiscuity\" or els e some spiritual condi- tion altogether unaffected by external circumstance s. When I started out on my quizzing tour I had at the head of the list of ques tions which I proposed to ask. in one form or another, \"Does the spirit of democra cy prevail in this university. But I soon dropped that question as unnecessary and fruitless, because it was answered everywhere before I asked it, and always i n the same way. There were two things about which faculty, students and alumni of each university visited agreed, that is on the purity of their democracy an d the beauty of their campus. In admitting deficiencies in other respects they we re usually frank enough and on some points even effusive, but on these two they wo uld acknowledge no superiors. Therefore as the net result of a hundred conversati ons bearing on this subject I have left in my memory a hazy composite something l ike this: \"There are other 518"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"Y ALE U NIVERSITY universities that are richer or older than ours; so me that have at present more students. Our president is not all that he should b e. The trustees do not always do the right thing. The faculty might be improved b y process of elimination and substitution. But nowhere will you find a prettier campus or a more democratic body of students.\" On the former point I was able t o use my own eyes, and shall take the liberty of expressing my personal op inions, but on the latter I was obliged to rely on hearsay evidence. Having just gi ven this evidence I shall dismiss the subject with the remark that in view of alarmis t reports about the growth of luxury, narrowness and class distinction, it is dis tinctly encouraging to find that the democratic spirit is still regarded as a desira ble thing to have in a university, even tho there may be a disposition to assume that it is already attained. I have observed a curious difference between Easter n and Western colleges in regard to the influence of the alumni. In the West the alumni are always urging forward their Alma Mater into untried paths. Someti mes a State Alumni As- sociation will take things into its own hands and, overruling president, trustees and faculty, will, by control of the legislature, f orce the university to take steps which it believes are necessary to bring it closer into touch with modern life. In the East on the contrary the alumni seem to be, as a whole, a conservative, even a reactionary influence, opposing almost any change, wise or unwise. I have asked many persons the reason of this and tho they genera lly have agreed that it is so, they have not given any explanation which, in my op inion, satisfactorily accounts for it. The most plausible of the explanations sugg ested to me is that the Eastern alumni are older on the average. But are not the fr eshly graduated about as re- luctant to have their Alma Mater changed as the old er men? Whatever the cause it raises the question whether the present movement to give the alumni a larger representation on the governing boards of State uni versities may not ultimately result in impeding rather than accelerating these i nstitutions. Eastern alumni are generous in the matter of financ ial support and certain individuals initiate important changes thru specifi c gifts, but as a body they are inclined to regard their Alma Mater as a relic of h appy schooldays and as such to keep it intact and unaltered, so that when they return they may find it as they remembered it. In 1888 several thousand of the Yale alumni signed a petition to the corporation remonstrating against the removal o f an old fence that was in the way of one of the new buildings, and what is wo rse, they celebrated twenty years later the anniversary of \"the fight that fail ed.\" It is the alumni, I believe, who are responsible for the preservation of Old Sou th Middle, which makes Yale look like a full-grown rooster with a bit of the sh ell from which it was hatched stuck on its back. In important matters it is the s ame. If it were proposed to cut down the college course to three years or to raise the Sheffield course to four; to make the Sheffield boys go to chapel or to release the college boys from going; to abolish the senior societies or to have more of the m, probably the majority of the alumni would oppose the change regardless of its ad vantages or disadvantages.

The finest thing about Yale is the student body. I do not think this is true of all the universities in this country. In some la boratories and libraries I have visited the students appeared out of place, unworth y of their beautiful buildings. In some classrooms 1 have pitied the instructors be cause they were expending so much good teaching on such poor material. But I did not pity the instructors in Yale. If they could not do something worth while with the earnest, energetic, wide-awake, well-ordered young men in the scats bef ore them, they could not anywhere. The Yale students as a rule are not blase , cynical and prematurely aged, nor on the other hand are they awkward, unrul y and obstreperous. They are not so studious and diligent as the average run of students in the State and city universities, but they come from more cultured homes and with more thoro preparation. After seeing the Yale boys in mass, I have come to think that the university gets more credit than it deserves for th e achievements of its graduates. This educational machinery that we talk so much abo ut is, after all, of minor importance. The product of the mill depends mostly on what kind of grain is poured into the hopper. I liked the way a man would stroll across the campu s in the evening, bareheaded and hand-pocketed, and call \"Oh Billy Rogers!\" to a four-story building, then hold a confidential conversation with the student w ho stuck his head out of one of the upper windows. I like the way they played di abolo and tops. I liked the way they heeled for the News. I liked the way they sang. Altogether they are a likable lot of fellows. 520"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"S OCIAL S YSTEM IN THE C OLLEGE C LARENCE W.

Probably the best way to u nderstand the changes is to visualize the situation in the early 70s. At the top of the system were the two Senior societ ies, Bones and Keys, then as now taking fifteen members each, elected at the end of junior year. These societies were local and entirely secret. Bones, which was or iginally Skull and Bone, was founded by fifteen men of the Class of 1833 as a re sult, it is said, of some injustice in the Phi Beta Kappa elections so that in another way Phi Beta Kappa may be considered the unintentional sponsor for the system . There was never any pledg- ing or discussion of elections which were given out on a Thursday evening in the individual rooms. A sharp distinction from all othe r societies except Keys which was modeled exactly upon Bones lay in the fact that graduates attended initia- tions and commencement dinners in large numbers. Ke ys and an unsuccessful society called Spade and Grave were the only other Senior societies at the time. Spade and Grave started as the result of a quarrel between three Bones editors of the Yale Lit and two non-society editors, but was s oon buried. In Junior year there were three fraternities, Alpha Delta Phi, Psi U and DKE all established between 1836 and 1844. In the 70s t he last two had what were considered extravagant houses, one on High street a nd the other on York of which the more elaborate was valued at nearly $15,0 00. These junior societies were chapters of national fraternities and took abo ut thirty men each. Their chief function seems to have been to engineer the electio n of the Wooden Spoon Com- mittee and the Yale Lit editors. There were nine me n on the former and five of the latter. Coalitions between various pairs of soc ieties always determined who should be the Spoon man and the editor in chief of the Lit. Beyond this political function the only object of the fraternities seems to have been self-perpetuation. So far as we can judge there was absolutely no frat ernity feeling. Only the Ju- nior Class members were interested or attended meet ings. There was no Senior delegation at all. In Sophomore year we find the societies which reall y created some intense interest. Kappa Sigma Theta and Alpha Sigma Phi had died out. But the result of a ruction between Psi U and DKE in 1864 had prod uced two societies known as Phi Theta Psi and Delta Beta Xi, vouched for by no lesser notables than Pro- fessor Thacher and Cyrus Northrop. The motto of the former was the familiar but tantalizing amici usque ad aras. Freshmen were pledged for these societies early in the year, about thirty to each. There was a notification night preceded by marching on the campus with dark lanterns and so ngs outside the rooms of the chosen. The Freshmen furnished the banquets. In itiations were secret and inside the houses, followed by a play and dinner. T he meetings were on Friday and the graduates had nothing to do with the frater nities except by invitation. In these Sophomore societies are to be found most o f the traditions which have continued in the modern fraternities and they rathe r than the junior fraterni- ties were the hunting grounds of the Senior society campaigners. Probably this was one of the reasons why they and one or two othe rs founded later were short 522"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"S OCIAL S YSTEM IN THE C OLLEGE lived. They were the step in the pyramid around whi ch centered the most severe general criticism, especially that which came from the faculty who in those days wielded rather a big stick. At the bottom of the social pyramid were the Freshm an societies Kappa Sigma Epsilon, Delta Kappa, and Gamma Nu. The last was an open society, the other two semi-secret. At first in the 40's the membershi p of a Freshman society had been twenty but in the 70s the whole class was divi ded between the three societies after a vigorous campaign for the best men which ex tended back into pre-college days. One blackball rejected a man but every Freshm an must belong to one of the three societies! How this worked out is somethi ng of a puzzle today. These Freshman societies tried to extend themselves to ot her colleges as the fraternities had done, but without much success. At some period certain schools regularly supplied particular societies. There was some open hazing of candidates, and each initiate was in charge of one Sophomore to see that life did not become dull for him at any moment. Such in abstract was the society situation fifty ye ars ago. The two great debating societies so-called, Linonia and Brothers in Unity, established in the middle of the eighteenth century, were purely voluntary and i ncluded all four years. They had rooms in Alumni Hall, held debates and listened to orations, poems, and essays. Their chief treasures were their libraries, which were kept in the wings of the old library. They had over 13,000 books each in 1870. There was a reading room supported by the societies and run by the Coll ege in the central part of South Middle with space for the College Book Store. On the racks of the reading room were to be found one hundred and twenty period icals, including Punch. A tax of $8.00 per annum was assessed on the member s, and the reading room was presided over by an \"indigent student.\" This re ading room superseded a newspaper rack in the bowling alleys of the old gym nasium. The evolution from this situation of the 70 s to th e present day social system is fairly obvious. The general societies, Linonia a nd Brothers, have become in part a library collection, in part mere names in Ha rkness Quadrangle. The most iron clad democracy could not maintain \"societies\" that took in every one of the increasingly numerous boys that came to Yale. P hi Beta Kappa, the source of the whole trouble, is now a respected badge of s cholarship. At the bottom of the pyramid the great unwieldy Freshman societie s died in the 80s. There seems to have been some merciful assistance given t hem from without to hasten their last moments, and the assistance was even mor e effective in the case of the Sophomore societies, which died a little later. The re soon sprang into existence, however, a new group of Sophomore societies taking in fifteen men apiece and quite obviously out of tune with the pyramid princi ple. He Boule, Eta Phi, and Kappa Psi formed a group of forty-five men who quit e regularly stuck together and furnished the material for the three Senior soc ieties (Wolf's Head had been founded meanwhile). Quite obviously they injured th e system in two ways. In the first place they selected and established a cho sen group early in the collesr 523"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY course, shattering the existing ideals of democracy . In the second place they produced something of a continuity of experience wh ich the old class system of societies had, in the interests of class spirit, pr evented. They were abolished by faculty action in 1902, and the present system real ly dates from that time. With no Sophomore or Freshman societies the Junior frate rnities slipped down to the beginning of Sophomore year, and in place of a pyra mid there came into being a large group of fraternities with continuous exist ence through three years, the group of smaller senior societies in the final year continuing as before. From this survey of the situation fifty years ago a nd now it is clear that most of our older customs and methods are more or less i ntact although they now belong to different organizations and different kin ds of organization. The fixed element amongst the many changes has been the Senio r society and even there the Elihu Club has introduced some relaxation of th e old austerity. In spite of external resemblances in custom and tradition the f raternities have largely reversed the theory of the early years that only the members of a given class should be interested in a given society. The delegation syste m inside of the fraternities is, however, a direct outcome of this old theory, a tra it persisting within a system which has practically discarded the theory as a who le. One distinct change is to be found in the present d ay principle that in general less than half of a class should be comprised withi n the fraternities. In the 70's everybody belonged to a Freshman society and a good deal more than half the class to a Junior society. The modern principle is different. Fraternities have increased in numbers in the Colle ge but only in proportion with the growth of the College. From decade to deca de the Sophomore societies were always a little out of gear with the rest of t he system. A curious incongruity in the system of the 70 s, namely the appearance of fraternities as the junior group in the society system, probably accounts for the tr aditional difficulty which the Yale chapters have always had with their national o rganizations. The fraternal urge was originally connected with sc holarly interests. Wit- ness Phi Beta Kappa and Chi Delta Theta. Witness th e great debating societies — open and general to be sure, but always cultivati ng club rivalry. Throughout the history of societies at Yale, and even in the l ast fifty years, the various or- ganizations have never entirely thrown overboard th e principle of intellectual stimulation as an excuse for existence in associati on with the principles of good fellowship and service to Yale. The relative import ance of the various principles is a most variable quantity. In the seventies we ar e told \"the sight of a Phi Beta key would raise a cry of derision.\" Today it may be that we have gone too far in the direction of shuffling off onto Phi Beta Kap pa, The Elizabethan Club, The Pundits and so on, all the responsibility of ca rrying our intellectual bur- den. But still the debates of the old freshman soci eties, the essays and orations and poems of the others have left their mark on our present society procedure. The descriptions of the absurdities of rushing week in the seventies and in the present decade are interchangeable.

And what of the resulting situation? Senior Societi es still loom overwhelmingly large on the Yale College horizon. In the past they have been the conservation of the best traditions of Yale. Today they do not main tain the standards as they have been reputed to in the earlier days. They must meet the fact that last year more than half their men were taken from the graduates o f three preparatory schools and that only two high school men were chosen. They must face the charge that the senior society men are no longer, through the fraternities, establishing standards which in themselves justify their existen ce. The Junior Fraternities are confronted today with a considerable body of honest conviction that they are worthless or even h armful at Yale. The foolish, small-town quality of open initiating is to say the least in bad taste. The marked tendency to encourage (some would say compel) drink ing on the part of the initiate is intolerable. The open house system now inaugurated has a tendency to increase the drift toward snobbish aloofness. All true — much of it too true. But the answer is w hat it always has been and must be. The human animal will make for itself grou ps within its social confines. The value of the smaller group is to accentuate and perpetuate the best in the larger group.

There are twenty-six fraternities in the f irst group, which have chapters or branches in from four to sixty-four of the highe r institutions of learning in the United States. Membership is confined in almost all instances to students studying the classics or those in the literary and scientifi c departments; membership originally was, and in a few instances to-day is, restricted t o upper-class men. This has resulted in the formation of similar societies among student s in professional schools, of which four have achieved prominence and a considera ble membership. With the increase of institutions for the higher education o f women, there have appeared nearly a dozen Greek and Roman letter secret societ ies for women undergraduates, half a dozen of which made themselves known beyond the walls of the colleges where they have an active existence. There are many college secret societies classed as local, that is, existing only at colleges where founded, some with Greek-letter and some with other titles, among the better known of which are the three senior class societies at Yale. If to the foregoing there be added those which have lived, shone, and left a record, American college life wil l be found to have given birth to almost one hundred secret societies of this particu lar and unique type. 527 C"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWEREUL S ECRET S OCIETY The form of government prior to 1870 was weak, cons isting of general super- vision by a Grand, usually the parent Chapter, or b y one chapter after another in turn, which made laws and regulations as it plea sed, communicated the fact to the other chapters and left it to their option t o obey them. But within the last quarter of a century conventions made up of de legates from chapters, with administrative bodies or councils, composed of alum ni members, have had a general supervision over and management of affairs, and in leading, instances have taken the place of an imperial form of governm ent. Annual conventions are held with undergraduate chapters, in turn, when undergraduate delegates act in the capacity of legislators, leaving the duties of all executive to the council of alumni. These reunions generally end with a banquet and formal public exer- cises at which distinguished members deliver addres ses of welcome, poems, and orations in the presence of delegates and other und ergraduate members, their relatives and friends. These exercises are rendered the more attractive because of the long list of alumni prominent in the various wa lks of life, who may be called on to discourse eloquently touching the fraternity and what it means to those who enjoy its privileges, or on literary and econom ic topics. Membership in college fraternities includes active, alumni, and honorary; but the latter, with a few exceptions, is no longer per mitted to increase, initiations being confined to undergraduates. At some of the la rger cities, graduate members have established alumni chapters or clubs. The olde r fraternities, for they do not rank necessarily according to membership, have publ ished accounts of their origin and growth; a number have issued elaborate and orna te catalogues, with lists of names of members arranged alphabetically by States and by colleges, with memo- randa as to rank in the society or at college and b iographical sketches of members distinguished in public life; not a few issue magaz ines and other periodicals, some of which are circulated privately. Nearly all have published music and song books of their own, in some instances have adopted distin ctive colors, and in others, flowers, as having a special significance. But most important, perhaps, are college fraternity badges, almost always made of gold, some times enamelled, and gener- ally set with precious stones. These are worn consp icuously by undergraduate members and by many long after leaving college. In a number of instances the badge consists of a monogram formed of the Greek le tters composing the name of the fraternity; in others, of a representation o f one or more emblems and in many instances of shields or rhombs, ornamented wit h enamelled, jewelled, or engraved letters and emblems. The Greek-letter fraternity is unique among secret societies, in that it is the only organization of the kind founded on an aristoc racy of social advantage and educational opportunity. Students have to be invite d to join them, and the un- dergraduate who should prove so unfamiliar with col lege customs as to ask to join one would probably never be permitted to do so. So \"secret\" are the Greek-letter fraternities, or most of them, that, although weari ng jewelled badges, members generally refuse to mention the organization in the presence of profanes.

Though this does happen, the member is said to be \" lifted.\" A student whose acquaintance has been cultivated, has been \"rushed; \" when he has been asked to join, he has been \"bid;\" and when he has agreed to do so, he is \"pledged;\" when he has been initiated and appears wearing the socie ty's badge, he is\" swung, out.\" In \"rushing\" a man it is customary to invite him to the fraternity house, where he meets the members, who watch his conduct and his co nversation. If he makes a good impression, he is invited again, taken to foot ball games, to the theatre, and invited to social affairs, and if all are satisfied the new man is a desirable acquisi- tion he is invited to join. After initiation the wa tch over a new member is kept up. He is guarded against falling behind in class w ork and is taught during all his rirst year that neither he nor his opinions are of importance. By the time he is a sophomore he has learned to make allowance for ever y one's point of view. Among about six hundred and fifty chapters of Ameri can college fraternities nearly seventy possess houses or temples valued at over $ 1,000,000, costing from $1,200 to $100,000. Some of them are elaborate and fanciful in design, others severely classic and still others sombre piles of b rick and stone. In many instances members lodge in fraternity houses, in others out o f them. The tabular exhibit on page 330 respecting some of the better known genera l Greek-letter fraternities is condensed from data for 1890 and 1891, furnished by William Raimond Baird in Johnson's Encyclopedia. The system of Greek-letter fraternities, nearly if not all of which are chartered corporations, is fitly characterized by John Addiso n Porter, private secretary to President McKinley, in a \"Century Magazine\" article , September, 1888, as \"the most prominent characteristic of American undergrad uate social life.\" A refer- ence to brief sketches of them will reveal the name s of a few of the 125,000 members who during, the greater part of the present century have done much to add lustre to the professional, political, and b usiness life of the Republic. The novitiate of the college fraternity soon learns to think of these men not only as brethren, but as models. President Seelye of Amhers t College, in an address on June 28, 1887, said: It is not accidental that the foremost men in colle ge, as a rule, belong to some of these societies. That each society should s eek for membership the best scholars, the best writers and speakers, the best m en of a class, shows well where its strength is thought to lie. A student entering one of these societies finds a healthy stimulus in the repute which his fraternity shall share from his successful work. The rivalry of individuals loses much of its narrowness, and almost all of its envy, when the prize which the individual seeks is valued chiefly for its benefit to the fellowship to which he belongs. Doubtless membe rs of these societies often remain narrow-minded and laggard in the race, after all the influence of their society has been expended upon them, but the influe nce is a broadening and 529"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY a quickening one notwithstanding. Under its power t he self-conceit of a young man is more likely to give way to self-control than otherwise. Mr. Porter adds this These \"little societies\" have supplied forty govern ers [sic] to most of the largest States of the Union, and had, in the last a dministration, the President of the United States and the majority of his Cabine t. On the Supreme Bench of the United States the fraternities are now (1888 ) represented by five of the associate justices. A summary, published in 1885, s howed Alpha Delta Phi, Psi Upsilon, and Delta Kappa Epsilon, to have furnished of United States senators, 39, 25, and 36, respectively; while in the last Con gress thirteen representatives and two senators were members of the last-named fra ternity alone; and in the membership of these three fraternities are included twenty-four bishops of the Protestant Episcopal Church. In view of the foregoing, it is with amusement rath er than concern that one recalls the active opposition to college secret soc ieties between 1845 and 1885 by the faculties of a few distinguished colleges an d officers of a number of other institutions of learning. This was due in part to t he antipathy for all secret soci- eties engendered in the minds of some who were clos e to but partly ignorant of the facts underlying the anti-Masonic agitation of from 1827 to 1840; partly to the warfare waged against secret associations of al l kinds by one or two religious denominations, and to some extent, to ignorance of all that pertains to these societies, or because antagonists had been refused by or expelled from member- ship in such organizations, or for special reasons applying to particular instances. All of this opposition, except that at Princeton, h as practically disappeared, the other colleges prohibiting Greek-letter fraternitie s not having either the standing as institutions of learning or the personnel among their students which would suggest the propriety of establishing chapters of t hese societies. The earliest warfare of this character was at Harva rd College in 1831, when John Quincy Adams and others, notably Joseph Story and Edward Everett, in- duced the parent Greek-letter society, Phi Beta Kap pa, to make public its so-called secrets and become an open, honorary organization. It is worth recalling that in 1831 Mr. Adams was elected an anti-Masonic and Whig candidate for Congress and that he had been defeated for reelection to the Presidency three years before by Andrew Jackson, a Freemason, at a time when publ ic feeling ran high against the Masonic Fraternity, owing to its supposed respo nsibility for the mysterious disappearance of one Morgan who, it was said, propo sed to reveal its secrets. Mr. Adams was led to \"'hate Freemasonry,\" not from any personal knowledge he had of it, but because of the attitude of politicians towa rd the institution who exercised a great influence over him. One result was a series of letters abusive of Freema- sonry which he published in the papers between 1831 and 1833, and another 530"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"C YCLOPAEDIA OF F RATERNITIES evidently, was his rescuing the chapter of Phi Beta Kappa at Harvard, his alma mater from the depths of iniquity to which he evide ntly thought its secrecy was leading it. Associate Justice Story was professor o f law at Harvard at the time, and Edward Everett, then member of Congress, was the ca ndidate (such is the irony of fate) for the Vice-Presidency of the Constitutio nal Union party in 1860. The latter organization, it will be recalled, was the r esiduary legatee of the so-called Know Nothing party, a proscriptive, political secre t society, which antagonized aliens and Roman Catholics from behind closed doors and at the ballot-box dur- ing the early fifties. [1850s] (See Know Nothing Pa rty.) There were few chapters of college secret societies in 1831, not more than a dozen scattered throughout New England, New York, and New Jersey, and communic ation between them either by mail or in, person was infrequent. There was no other effect of the effort by Adams, Story, and Everett until in 1834, when a \"non-secret\" Greek-letter society, Delta Upsilon,* [*There is an anti-secret society called Delta Upsilon which exists at a number of colleges and grew out o f a confederation of societies having their origin in opposition to the secret soc ieties. It makes more or less point, of the alleged immorality of the secrecy of the fraternities and its chapters work with or against the fraternities as may seem t o them expedient.—Baird's American College Fraternities, New York,] was forme d at Williams College. It exists to this day, with chapters in twenty-six colleges, and has many of the outward peculiarities of the secret Greek-letter fraterniti es. It reveals very little more of what it does than the latter, and calls itself priv ate instead of secret. Eleven years later, 1845, the faculty of the University of Michi gan demanded the disband- ment of chapters of Alpha Delta Phi, Chi Psi, and B eta Theta Pi under penalty of expulsion of members and required new students t o sign a pledge not to join such societies. The fight between the faculty and t he few members of the then far western branches of those fraternities lasted f ive or six years. The members of Beta Theta Pi tried to 'evade the rule and killed t he chapter in the attempt, Alpha Delta Phi and Chi Psi fought the faculty tooth and nail, in the press throughout the State, by means of an informed and healthy publ ic sentiment, and with the aid of Freemasons and Odd Fellows, until the rule w as rescinded. Two professors were expelled from the faculty by the Board of Rege nts and one was allowed to resign. A new president of the university was appoi nted shortly after and there was no further trouble. This anti-fraternity war, a lmost one of extermination, was another outcome of anti-secret society sentimen t created by the anti-Masonic agitation a few years before. Opposition to the Gre ek-letter fraternities continued to show itself at some colleges through faculty reg ulations prohibiting their or- ganization, notably at the Universities of Alabama, North Carolina, and Illinois; at Oberlin and others by requiring students to sign a pledge at matriculation, not to join such societies, which was the course pu rsued at Princeton in 1857, at Purdue, Dennison, and elsewhere. The refusal of the University of California in 1879 to permit a chapter of one of these societies to exist roused the press of that State, and the order was speedily rescinded.

Within the past fifteen years anti-fraternity laws have been repealed or ig nored by Harvard as well as Vanderbilt, and by the Universities of North Caroli na, Georgia, Iowa, Missouri, and Alabama. The secrecy of these societies is conf ined to so little besides privacy of meetings that it hardly calls for comment. While largely social, their aims are high and ideals lofty. Advantages secured and frien dships gained through them are often among the most valuable acquisitions of t he college student. Origin and Extension. — American Greek-letter colle ge secret societies began with the formation of Phi Beta Kappa at the College of William and Mary, Wil- liamsburg, Va., December 5, 1776. Secret or semi-se cret, as well as open, literary college societies, usually with Latin names, alread y existed, where debates and annual elections of officers were often the first t raining of the young student in public speaking and in politics. William and Mary w as a successful and prosper- ous college one hundred and twenty-one years ago, a nd there it was that five young men formed a new and, as they believed, more effective students' organi- zation. There was already a society there with a La tin name, and as one of the five students was a good Greek scholar, it has been thought that may have sug- gested the propriety of a Greek-letter name. In any event, they chose a Greek motto of three words, the initials of which are Phi Beta Kappa; decided to keep the society's proceedings secret; declared themselv es a fraternity; established a few local branches, of which nothing has been heard sin ce, and chapters at Yale and Harvard, which preserved the society and founded wh at has grown into a veri- table world of Greek-letter fraternities. (See Phi Beta Kappa; also accompanying genealogical charts showing the order and place of establishment of earlier chap- ters of Phi Beta Kappa, and some of the other older Greek-letter fraternities, whether imitators of or merely inspired by a spirit of rivalry to those which pre- ceded them.) The parent chapter of Phi Beta Kappa b ecame dormant at the approach of Lord Cornwallis in 1781. The Yale Chapt er was established in 1780, and that at Harvard a year later. These were origin ally the Zeta and Epsilon Chapters, Beta, Gamma and Delta having been assigne d to now extinct, local, non-collegiate Virginia chapters. They subsequently became the Alphas, respec- tively of Connecticut and Massachusetts. From this, doubtless, arose the custom 532"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"C YCLOPEDIA OF F RATERNITIES in many of the Greek-letter fraternities of designa ting chapters by Greek letters, the oldest in a State as Alpha, and so on. Six year s later, in 1787, the Yale and Harvard Chapters took Phi Beta Kappa to Dartmouth, at Hanover, N. H., and in 1817 thirty years after, it was established at U nion College at Schenectady, N. Y. It was during this thirty years' interval that t he older college literary societies flourished, many of which had Latin names, some of which are still active, but most of which have given way to the Greek-letter fr aternities, except at Princeton, where Whig and Clio continue features -of student l ife; and at Lafayette, where Washington and Jefferson claim a large share of att ention. Four years after Phi Beta Kappa was taken to Union College, a second Gre ek-letter fraternity was founded at Yale, manifestly suggested by Phi Beta K appa, which had been there forty-one years. It was called Chi Delta Theta, and differed from its progenitor in that it never established branches or chapters a t other colleges, but remained a local, and, more recently an honorary society, me mbership in it being practi- cally an honor conferred upon the editorial staff o f the Yale \"Literary Magazine.\" Two years later, in 1823 according to tradition, a Kappa Alpha club was formed at Union College, there being at that time no inten tion of making it a secret society. Whether the thought of rivalling the then comparatively widespread Greek-letter fraternity Phi Beta Kappa was the insp iration is not known, but the probabilities indicate that the second Greek-letter fraternity at Union was mod- elled after the first. Their names are suggestively alike and a comparison of the watchkey badges of both would seem to settle the qu estion. In 1825 Kappa Alpha club blossomed out as a regular Greek-letter frater nity, and two years later, stimulated by a spirit of emulation, Sigma Phi was founded and within a few months Delta Phi was organized, the third at Union College, which institution has proved a veritable mother of fraternities. Thes e three societies, the \"Union Triad,\" are, more than any others, except Phi Beta Kappa, responsible for the widespread interest shown during the past sixty yea rs in this department of secret, social, and literary life at American colleges. Sig ma Phi was the first to follow the example of Phi Beta Kappa by establishing chapters, its original branch being at Hamilton College, Clinton, N. Y, where it was estab lished in 1831. Kappa Alpha was quick to follow the example, but the Hamilton s tudents who were approached by the \"Kaps\" declined to become members of that so ciety, and in 1832 found- ed one of their own, calling it Alpha Delta Phi. It was in 1832 also that the Yale society commonly called Skull and Bones appeared. I t has continued a purely local organization, on the lines of other college f raternities, without a Greek-let- ter title, but with more mystery and prestige than usually surrounds a society which does not venture beyond the place of origin. It is due to Skull and Bones that what is known as the Yale secret society syste m differs from that at almost all other colleges. At the latter, members of a fra ternity would as soon think of committing treason as join a second college society ; but at Yale the sophomore joins one of the junior Greek-letter fraternities, if asked, and then lives in the unuttered hope of being invited to join one of the local senior-year fraternities. 533"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Whether successful or not, his interest in his juni or society (one of the three most renowned which have chapters at the older instituti ons of learning) is not, as a rule, of that deep and lasting nature which charact erizes members of the same society at other colleges. In 1829, three years bef ore Skull and Bones was found- ed, I. K. A. (not Greek), appeared at Washington, n ow Trinity College, Hartford, Conn., and, like the former, has remained a local s enior society ever since. In 1833 Union College gave birth to another fraternity , Psi Upsilon, which, within a few years, followed Alpha Delta Phi, which led in placing chapters in the then foremost colleges and universities. Alpha Delta Phi shocked some of the conservative spirits of 1835 by placing chapter s at the University of New York and in what was then regarded as the far West, at M iami University, Oxford, Ohio. In 1836 it appeared at Columbia in New York C ity and at Amherst in 1837 at Yale, Harvard, and Brown, and in 1838 at th e Cincinnati Law School; so that within six years it possessed nine chapters as contrasted with only four chapters of Phi Beta Kappa, four of Sigma Phi, one of Delta Phi, all older societ- ies, and as compared with two chapters of Psi Upsil on. A brief account of the local, senior-class society, The Mystic Seven found ed at Wesleyan University (since absorbed by Beta Theta Pi), may be found in the sketch of the Heptasophs, or Seven Wise Men. The advent of Alpha Delta Phi at Miami resulted in the formation of BetaTheta Pi. In 1837 Psi Upsilon went to the University of New York, to Yale, and in 1840 to Brown, in which year Alpha Delta Phi was estab- lished at Hobart. In 1841 Union arose to the occasi on again and gave birth to another, its fifth fraternity, Chi Psi, and in 1842 , stimulated by the success of Skull and Bones at Yale, Scroll and Key made its ap pearance there, to choose fifteen juniors annually and divide the honors, as far as possible, with the older senior society. In 1844 a schism from the Yale Chap ter of Psi Upsilon resulted in the formation of a third \"junior-year fraternity \" Delta Kappa Epsilon, the only living society originating at Yale which has establ ished chapters at other colleges and has conformed to the college society system exi sting out of New Haven. Alpha Delta Phi, Psi Upsilon, and Delta Kappa Epsil on, for fifty years, have been closely associated in the minds of the members of t he college world, and are fairly classed as the three great college fraternit ies. They are great rivals and num- ber many distinguished names in professional, polit ical, commercial, and indus- trial life on the lists of their alumni. A large pr oportion of their chapters own their own houses or temples. At most of the older E astern and Middle State col- leges and universities chapters of two of these fra ternities are to be found, and at many such institutions the three meet as rivals. In the latter instance, as pointed out by Baird,* [*American College Fraternities; New York, James P. Downs, 1890.] the colleges are historic, which is due to the fact that forty years ago such col- leges were the centres of the literary activity of the country. New chapters of Alpha Delta Phi, Psi Upsilon, Delta Kappa Epsilon, and Beta Theta Pi were established with comparative fre quency between 1844 and 1861, the societies ranking during that period abou t in the order named.

The original Southern college fraternity, \"Th e Rainbow,\" founded at the University of Mississippi in 1841, believed to have been an offshoot from the Mystical Seven of Wesleyan, did not live long. (See Order of the Heptasophs.) The Princeton and Hobart orders of Chi Phi united in 18 67, and the Southern order of Chi Phi joined them in 1874, when the amalgamate d orders took the name of the Chi Phi fraternity. After the Civil War ther e was not much opportunity for new college fraternities to compete with those already in the field, except in the South, where chapters of Northern fraternities had disappeared. As shown in an accompanying genealogical chart of these orga nizations, five Greek-letter fraternities were established at Southern education al institutions between 1864 and 1870: Alpha Tau Omega at Virginia Military Inst itute, and Kappa Alpha (southern) at Washington-Lee University, Virginia, in 1865; Kappa Sigma at the University of Virginia in 1867; Pi Kappa Alpha at t he same place in 1868, and Sigma Nu at the Virginia Military Institute in 1869 , all of which have sent out branches and prospered. Aside from the founding in 1884 of a third local senior society, Wolf's Head, at Yale, the past twenty-seve n years have developed few, if any, college fraternities of national repute except professional and women's soci- eties. The quarter of a century in this department of college life has witnessed a rapid growth on the part of some fraternities which , just after the war, were not ranked among the first half dozen, and by others, t he development of abnormal conservatism, with a tendency to let well enough al one, and in some instances to live on prestige. An accompanying chart makes it pl ain that after Kappa Alpha, Sigma Phi, and Delta Phi at Union bad given rise to Alpha Delta Phi and to Psi Upsilon, the former to Beta Theta Pi and the latter to Delta Kappa Epsilon, that the line of propagation, as it were, was divided. O ne course was the outcome of the activity of Alpha Delta Phi and Beta Theta Pi, resulting in Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Kappa Psi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon Delta Tau Delta, Alpha Tau Omega Kappa Alpha (southern) and Sigma Nu, the other, the result of Psi Upsilon and Delta Kappa Epsilon stimulus, including Sigma Chi, Kappa Sigma, Pi Kappa Alpha, and Phi Kappa Sigma. Among remainin g prominent societies Chi Psi and Theta Delta Chi had their origin at Uni on, and Delta Psi and Zeta Psi in New York city, where Alpha Delta Phi, Psi Up silon and Delta Phi had each preceded them. The foregoing suggests a classificat ion of college fraternities into general, honorary, professional, women's and local. 535"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY The older societies in the first group may be subdi vided according to seniority and place of origin as follows: G ENERAL F RATERNITIES . ___________________________ Union Triad.—Kappa Alpha, Sigma Phi, Delta Phi.

The characteristics of the three earlier fraterniti es at Union College are broadly marked. Twenty years ago and for a long time preced ing, the membership of the few chapters of Kappa Alpha (very few had or ha ve been established) was limited and exclusive, while the policy of the frat ernity was distinctly one of non-extension. Its immediate imitator, Sigma Phi, w as not long in securing a like classification. It, too, had a restricted numb er of chapters, and a tendency to regard the grandfather as having much to do with the man. Delta Phi was less exclusive, but did not establish many new chap ters and has held to its ear- lier standard with less success than the other two. Baird says of the three great fraternities, Alpha Delta Phi, Psi Upsilon, and Del ta Kappa Epsilon, that \"they are rivals of each other more frequently than of ot her societies, and have the common characteristics of chapters of large size, l iterary work in their meet- ings, and wealth in their outward appointments.\" He thinks the first excels in literary spirit, the second in the cultivation of t he social side of life, and that the third \"occupies a middle ground.\" At Yale they are junior societies, and at that place, more often than otherwise, are stepping tones to the senior societ- ies. They are found as rivals at Hamilton, Columbia , Yale, Amherst, Brown, Bowdoin, Dartmouth, Michigan Rochester, Wesleyan, K enyon, Cornell, Trinity, and Minnesota; the first and third at Western Reser ve, Williams, and College of the City of New York; the second and third at Ch icago and Syracuse, and the first two at Union. Psi Upsilon also has chapte rs at New York University, University of Pennsylvania, and Lehigh; Alpha Delta Phi at Harvard, Johns Hopkins and Toronto; and Delta Kappa Epsilon at Col by, Lafayette, Colgate, Rutgers, Middlebury, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institu te, De Pauw, Central, Miami, California, Vanderbilt, Virginia, North Caro lina, Alabama, and Mis- sissippi. Alpha Delta Phi and Psi Upsilon continue to pay that attention to the social standing and literary excellence among their members which has ever characterized almost all of the chapters of each, b ut are more conservative as to extension than formerly. Delta Kappa Epsilon is noticeable for good fellow- ship and numerous chapters, some of which as noted, are at minor colleges. 536"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"C YCLOPEDIA OP F RATERNITIES Beta Theta Pi, the first western fraternity, is now one of the largest and best governed. It places less weight on the propriety or desirability of what has been called conservatism with respect to increase of cha pters and maintains as high literary excellence among members as older and form erly more distinguished fraternities. Chi Psi, while not so restricted as t o number of chapters as Sigma Phi or Kappa Alpha, continues one of the smaller so cieties; its reputation is as much for good fellowship as for social or litera ry excellence. Zeta Psi was formerly one of the smaller fraternities, but adopt ed a policy of extension and has grown rapidly. It is very secret, was founded b y Freemasons, and in recent years has made a remarkable advance in standing and membership. The socially exclusive members of Delta Psi, like those of Sigma Phi and Kappa Alpha, do not add to their few chapters. There is consider able wealth centred in this organization. Among western societies which have sh own enterprise and have become prominent of late years are Phi Kappa Psi, P hi Delta Theta, and Phi Gamma Delta. Some of the relatively smaller or youn ger societies, such as Theta Delta Chi, the (amalgamated) Chi Phi, Sigma Chi, an d Delta Tau Delta, are particularly strong at a number of colleges. The fr aternities in the Pennsylvania and Miami groups, as a whole, have paid more attent ion to extension than to the exclusiveness which has marked societies formin g the Union, Historic, and Double Triads. Most of the Chapters of the Southern group are confined to colleges in the South. Since 1880, Beta Theta Pi, P hi Delta Theta, Delta Tau Delta, Phi Kappa Psi, Sigma Chi, and Phi Gamma Delt a, which, prior thereto, were found almost exclusively in western and southe rn colleges, began to invade colleges and universities of the North and East, wh ere to-day, in some instances, they dispute supremacy with older fraternities.

Kappa Kappa Gamma, organized at Monmouth, 111., 187 0 by four young women, in preference to accepting membership in a p roposed sisterhood. It spread to colleges through the central western and northwe stern States, and by 1890 had twenty-two active chapters, with a form of gove rnment similar to that of many Greek-letter fraternities. It's colors are dar k and light blue and the badge is a jewelled key with the letters Kappa Kappa Gamma a nd Alpha Omega Omicron enamelled in black thereon. Present membership: abo ut 2,200 Kappa Alpha Theta, organized at De Pauw University, Indiana, in 1870, by a daughter of a member of Beta Theta Pi and three oth er women students, assisted by the father of the founder. Its government was ve sted in the parent chapter until 1883, when it was placed in the hands of a Gr and Chapter composed of one member from each chapter. Its flower is the pan sy, its colors are black and gold and its badge is a kite shaped shield with a b lack- field and white chevron bearing the Greek letters forming its name. Its twe nty active chapters in 1890 were scattered through the central western and nort hwestern States, with a few in California, Pennsylvania, New York, and Vermont. Present membership is approximately 1,900. Delta Gamma, founded at the University of Mississip pi, in 1872, by three women, the outgrowth of a social organization at a neighboring educational institution. The twelve active chapters in 1890 wer e distributed through south- ern, central, northwestern, a few far western, and in eastern States. March 15 is observed as a day of reunion, when the alumni, s o far as possible, visit active chapters or communicate with them by mail. A Grand (governing) and a Deputy Grand Chapter is chosen every four years. There are alumni chapters at Cleveland, Milwaukee, Chicago, and other cities.

Alpha Phi, founded at Syracuse University in 1872, by ten women students. Nine years later it established the second or Beta, Chapter, that at Northwestern University, but has continued a conservative policy in this respect, having formed only five chapters by 1890, the others being at Bos ton University, De Pauw, and Cornell.

Russell, '37, who died a few yea rs ago, after having been for many years at the head of a famous military academy in the city of New Haven. It is a part of college tradition that \"Bones\" is a branch of a university corps in Germany, in which country General Russell spent som e time before his graduation. One of the classmates who joined with him in establ ishing the society at Yale was the late Alphonso Taft of Cincinnati, President Hay es's Attorney-General.

For a long time it held its meetings in hired rooms; but in 1856 the windowless, vine-covered bro wn stone hall in High Street, near Chapel Street, opposite the campus, was erecte d. A few years ago the society found more space necessary and built a large wing t o the hall. The building is about 30 feet high, 33 feet wide, and 44 feet deep. The property is held by the Russell Trust Association, a name assumed in honor of General Russell. On the last Thursday in May the entire college assembles b efore Durfee Hall, among whom the juniors are conspicuous, for they all know that lightning is to strike forty-five of them. Soon a \"Bones\" man appears who, however good natured, wears a solemn look as he passes in and out among t he crowd. Suddenly he taps or slaps a junior on the shoulder,* and says sternl y, \"Go to your room.\" Amid wild cheering the lucky man obeys mutely followed b y the one who tapped him, who says, \"Will you accept an election to the socie ty known as 'Skull and Bones?'\" and goes away in silence, while the junior returns to receive the congratulations of friends. About the same time a Keys man, and a \" Wolf's Head\" man in his wake, go through the same evolutions. Between \"tapp ing time\" and initiation a week elapses. During this time the slapper and th e slapped preserve a sacred mutual silence, except when the new man is notified of the time and place of the awful ordeal, to be consummated in the recesses of the society house. This peculiar ceremony of nominating or choosing ne w members of the Yale senior societies, original there with Skull and Bon es and imitated by \"Keys\" and by Wolf's Head, is, doubtless, derived from the acc olade, or conferring of knight- hood, in ancient times an embrace; but more recentl y a blow on the shoulder with the flat of a sword. But still more singular i s the custom of the Yale juniors in assembling on the campus between four and six o' clock, on the particular Thursday in May, accompanied by half the college, a nd hundreds of other spec- tators, entirely without announcement from or arran gement by any one. The writer first referred to points out, in addition to the fact that Yale's senior societ- ies meet Thursday nights in closely guarded society houses, that a \"Bones\" man. while in college, is never without his badge, a sku ll and bones, with the figures \"322\" in place of the lower jaw; that if in swimmin g without bathing costume, he carries it in his mouth; that one of the newly c hosen \"Bones\" men wears two (overlapped) badges for six months, and that the \"s anctum sanctorum\" in the \"Bones\" house is referred to by the figures \"322.\" There is a tradition, however, that the \"322,\" the sum of which is the perfect num ber and suggests a \"mystical seven,\" means \"founded in '32,2nd chapter (the firs t being \"the German corps\"): also, that the members trace their society \"to a Gr eek patriot organization, dat- ing back to Demosthenes, 322 B.C. The 'Bones' recor ds of 1881, it, is alleged, are headed 'Anno-Demotheni 2203.' \" An election to \"Bones\" is generally the secret ambition of almost all Yale men, even over t he bones of the Greek-letter societies, although Scroll and Key, and Wolf's Head , of late, have made such *Secret Societies at Yale.

Skull and Bones, Scroll an d Key, and Wolf's Head, as a matter of practice, each elect fifteen members an nually, generally from among members of the first three societies named, seldom from members of that last named, and still less frequently elect a junior who is not a member of any, of the Greek-letter fraternities.

Its badge consists of an owl on the top of a column or pillar between the letter s forming the society's name. It numbers three governors of Vermont among its alu mni.

Scroll and Key was founded at Yale in 1841, by memb ers of the class of '42, as a rival senior society to Skull and Bones, most of the peculiarities of which it copied. (See Skull and Bones.) It celebrated its fi ftieth anniversary with a three days' jubilee in May, 1892, in its society house at New Haven, one of the hand- somest structures of the kind in the country. It is incorporated as the Kingsley Trust Association. It is related that on the nights when the society meets all the active \"Keys\" men in New Haven are required to be i n the society house from half-past six until half-past twelve, and that none of them is allowed to leave the building during that period, \"unless accompanied by another man.\" In preserving a deep mystery about its affairs, in not mentioning the society in the presence of an outsider, and in retaining constant possessio n of badges by undergraduate members, \"Keys\" parallels its prototype. While memb ers of the latter wear their badges on their vests, \"Keys\" men frequently wear t heirs on their necktie. The \"Keys\" badge consists of a gold key across a scroll , with the letters \"C.

It copies most, if not all, of the pecu liarities of the two older senior societies. For a few years it was not rated as high ly as either \"Bones\" or \"Keys,\" and was able to take only the so-called better men in the Junior Class overlooked by \"Bones\" and \"Keys;\" but with the increase in the size of classes, and the fact that each of the senior societies takes only fiftee n men each year, with increased age and its handsome ivy-clad society house.

Phi Nu Theta was organized at Wesleyan University, 1837, shortly after the appearance there of the Mystical Seven which is now dead, and in some respects one of the most remarkable college societies in the country. Phi Nu Theta sought to bring together a few members of each class for m utual helpfulness and within the past sixty years has initiated about 460 member s. It has a handsome house, and ranks well among Middletown college fraternities. I ts badge is a scroll watch-key with the letters forming its name engraved thereon. Among its alumni are Rev. Dr. Winchell, formerly of Syracuse University, the late Bishop Haven and Pro- fessor W. O. Atwater. Kappa Kappa Kappa. Founded at Dartmouth, Hanover, N . H., in 1842, by six students, assisted by Professor C. B. Haddock, the year following the appear- ance of Scroll and Key at Yale. It numbers about 85 0 members. The badge is a Corinthian column and capital of gold with the lett ers K. K. K. at the base. It has generally ranked with other fraternities at Dar tmouth. Delta Psi. Organized at the University of Vermont i n 1850. For a few years it was an anti-secret society. It has no connection with t he fraternity by the same name which was founded at Columbia in 1847. It numbers a bout 350 members. Alpha Sigma Pi. Organized at Norwich University, Ve rmont, in 1857, by seven students. The military character of the socie ty was the natural outcome of the college where it appeared. Its colors are bl ue and white, and the badge is a gold shield displaying a flag and musket cross ed over a drum and the Greek letters forming the name of the organization. Present membership, about 290. General Granville M. Dodge is, perhaps, its most widely known alumnus. Phi Zeta Mu was organized in the scientific school, Dartmouth, in 1857, by five students, members of '58 and '59.

T he parent chapter died from internal disagreements, the first two branches were suppressed by college faculties, and the fourth was withdrawn by the soci ety itself, which flourishes, therefore, solely at Marietta College. It has about 300 names in its catalogue, and there are several organizations of its alumni. The society has a fine house. Its badge consists of a shield bearing an open book on which are hieroglyphics, across it a quill and letters forming the name of t he society. Berzelius was established at Sheffield, Yale Colleg e, in 1863. Its membership is about 370. The badge \"is a combination of potash bulbs in gold,\" over which is the letter \"B.\" It ranks high among Yale scienti fic students. Sigma Delta Chi was founded at Sheffield Scientific School, Yale, in 1867. It is sometimes referred to as Book and Snake, beca use its badge consists of an open book displaying the letters Sigma Delta Chi, s urrounded by a serpent. It is prosperous and has about 300 members. The foregoing makes it plain that the secret societ y system at Yale is something radically different from that at other colleges. Th e difference may be made clear by stating that at almost all colleges the freshman who receives a bid from and joins a Greek-letter fraternity unites with an inte rstate or national society which represents the social, literary, and human side of college life and binds him closely to itself not only while an undergraduate, but for life. At Yale when there used to be freshmen as well as s ophomore,' junior, and senior societies, the same general cliques or group of \"fellows\" were taken into the same freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior so cieties in a mass, a sort of four degrees system, each society representing a di fferent \"degree.\" The freshmen societies were merely Yale affairs, with no ligamen ts reaching to other colleges, and the like is true to-day of Yale's sophomore societi es. Its three junior fraternities are, indeed, parts of as many national college soci eties, with a prestige not second even to Yale's senior societies, but one must leave the shadows of Yale to appreci- ate the fact. The Yale senior societies, owing to t his exceptional and unfortunate system so far as the Yale sophomore and junior soci eties are concerned, are goals, and the sophomore and junior societies are merely s tepping-stones. Twenty-five years ago the rival freshmen societies were \"D. K.\" (Delta Kappa) and \"Sigma Epps\" (Kappa Sigma Epsilon). The sophomore members endeavored to select freshmen most likely to make a mark while in colleg e, and great efforts were made by the rival societies to outwit each other an d get \"the best men.\" When the initiation ceremonies were held, a month later, the sophomores felt that they were rewarded for their trouble. A correspondent of the New York \"Sun\" has described substantially what took place at the init iation of freshmen during the palmy days of \"D. K.\" and \"Sigma Epps,\" as follows: The candidate received a black-bordered notificatio n of his election, with instructions to repair the following evening to som e remote street corner.

Then ensued a Wa lhalla dance through bypath and wood and dell. Now the candidate was run at ful l speed against a tree, now he trembled astride a picket fence, now the bandage was slipped so as to give one glance of an open grave or the dizzy verge of East Rock. Then, after many miles and countless turns he was hurried, all panting, strugg ling, and stumbling, through a busy street, made evident by jostlings and derisi ve calls. He was forced step by step to mount backward a seemingly interminable fli ght of stairs, and to wait in a close and heated room until there was a sudden up ward jerk, the bandage was removed, and be found himself on the roof of a high building with others of his classmates, equally confused and exhausted. When at length the candidate's name was called in sombre tones he advanced all uncertai n to the scuttle. There he was bound and blindfolded. Strong arms grasped him from above and from below. He descended rapidly with many a bump. He was dragg ed into the main hall, flung into a great canvas blanket with rope handles , and then, with all the force of a score of excited young devotees, tossed and sl apped again and again against the lofty ceiling. He was rolled in a cask and nail ed in a coffin, and stretched on a guillotine with one blade—all to an accompaniment of sulphurous smoke and lurid flashes and piercing yells of '\"My poor fresh .\" But these ceremonies were not always without unfort unate results, and at times were marked, by a degree of hilariousness not expla ined entirely on the ground of good nature and a desire to look on the humorous side of life. The displeasure of the faculty was an outcome, and in 1880 the soci eties were abolished. The only remaining Yale freshman fraternity, Gamma Nu, found ed in 1859 as a non-secret, literary society, died from internal weakness in 18 89, since which time Yale Greek-letter or other secret freshmen societies hav e been extinct. Twenty-five years ago Yale's sophomore fraternities were Phi Theta Ps i and Delta Beta Xi, founded on the ruins, as it were, of Kappa Sigma Phi and Al pha Sigma Theta. The first, called \"Theta Psi,\" was practically a stepping-ston e to Psi Upsilon, and Delta Beta\" was all ante-room leading to the sanctum sanctorum of Delta Kappa Epsilon. They took about thirty men each and held weekly mee tings, features of which were mild-mannered literary exercises and sometimes punch that was anything but mild. So serious were the results of one occasi on of that kind, in 1878, that the faculty unceremoniously \"twisted the neck\" of t he \"phoenix of Theta Psi\" and closed \"the book of Delta Beta forever.\" The two ex isting sophomore societies are He Boule and Eta Phi, the first formed in 1875 and the latter in 1879, among the most powerful organizations at Yale, it being s eldom that a member of each fails of an election to the junior societies. They are almost if not quite as secret in their workings as the senior societies, and constit ute a formidable factor in college politics. The names of the seventeen members of eac h, together with their places of meeting, are confidently believed by members to be unknown to the outside world; and while, as a matter of fact, such is seld om or never the case, the fiction is encouraged.

Alpha Delt a Phi, Psi Upsilon, and Delta Kappa Epsilon of national fame, with chapters at ma ny other colleges, each takes thirty-five sophomores at the end of the year. Zeta Psi, a two-year society at Yale, also takes its quota. As explained in the sketch of Skull and Bones, these elections have an important bearing on the chances of those s elected for securing member- ship in one of the three senior societies. About tw enty-five years ago Alpha Delta Phi refused to continue to be made a means to an en d, merely a way to a senior society, and withdrew its Yale Chapter. For nearly a score of years thereafter Psi Upsilon and Delta Kappa Epsilon monopolized desirab le junior recruits on their way to \"Bones\" and \"Keys,\" and after 1881 to Wolf's Head. Six or seven years ago Alpha Delta Phi revived its Yale Chapter, the oldes t secret society at Yale except Skull and Bones, as a four-year fraternity, and tri ed to make it a Yale organization on a par with even the senior year fraternities. It met with only moderate success, owing to the overpowering, weight of Yale sentiment in favor of class societies, and within a few years accepted the situation, beca me a junior society again, so far as that chapter is concerned, built one of the handsomest and most expensive fraternity houses at New Haven, and revived its anc ient standing as a worthy rival of the Yale variety of Psi Upsilon and Delta Kappa Epsilon. This junior society rivalry, however, is more on th e surface than otherwise, the three fraternities being practically private social clubs which meet separately, of course, to cooperate in the production of plays and burlesques and in even more distinctively social entertainments. The \"Alpha Del t,\" \"Psi U,\" and \"Deke\" halls, or houses, at New Haven are among the most elaborat e and costly structures of the kind in the country. In the week prior to the \" tapping\" ceremonial of the senior societies, in May (see Skull and Bones), the junior societies appear on the campus attired in gowns and hoods, singing each its own peculiar songs, after which they retire to their several buildings and pr oceed to initiate the thirty-five newly pledged members who are to act as heirs and a ssigns of these fraternities for the ensuing college year. The inspiration, development, rituals, and function of the general college fraternities, those which do not live in vain, whic h hold the remembrance and affection of members well on into their declining y ears, which often divide the regard felt for alma mater, call for an analysis wh ich the mere chronicler may well be excused for not attempting. A recent writer stat ed that many men who have belonged to a Greek Letter society during their und ergraduate days lose interest in the matter before they are five years away from their alma mater. This is almost inevitable because of new interests and because a l arge number of graduates are not associated in their homes with men who belong to th eir fraternity. \"One can hardly refrain from believing the author of the sentiment is a Yale man. The \"Bones\" or \"Keys\" graduate of Yale might naturally find the height of his ambition in an election to a senior society.

The Greek-letter fraternities antedate all other existing secret societies in America, exc ept the fraternity of Freemasons. They vary more than might be supposed, for members are always convinced of the superiority of their own fraternities over all rivals and confident of the greater loyalty of their own alumni. Some have elaborate ri tuals and others ceremonials which would be regarded by good judges as commonpla ce. The world at large, unfortunately, has had abundant evidence during the past twenty-five years of the sensational if not solemn character of the init iation ceremonies of some, as the results were such as to endanger the lives of i nitiates. Heckethorn [Secret Societies of All Ages.] and some others attribute the found- ing, in 1776, of Phi Beta Kappa, the mother of Amer ican college Greek-letter fraternities, to the Illuminati, of Weishaupt, in B avaria, but this is undoubtedly mere conjecture. The Illuminati itself was founded in 1776, and it is hardly likely that a few boys at the College of William and Mary in Virginia, in those days of extremely infrequent letter-writing and trans-Atlan tic voyages, were inspired in their formation of a Greek-letter secret society by the illustrious foreigner whose name is linked to an order which for a short time w as grafted upon Freemasonry and then disappeared forever. There is no reason fo r believing that American college Greek Letter societies had any inspiration beyond what appeared on the surface, until after 1828, the year following the d isappearance of Morgan, who was accused of being about to betray Masonic secret s. In that and several succeed- ing years politicians made use of this \"good enough Morgan until after election,\" and so fanned the anti-Masonic flame that thousands of well-meaning people discovered prejudices against the fraternity which they never till then suspected themselves of possessing. Reference has been made t o the effect on John Quincy Adams, Edward Everett, and others, and the history of that time will reveal some, notably Thurlow Weed, who were less sincere in thei r antagonism to Freemasonry, even though no less bitter. This presented an oppor tunity to cranks and charlatans which was not to be despised, and the country was s peedily flooded with sup- posititious Masonic ceremonies and alleged accounts of revelations of Masonic secrets. The public mind was directed to that subje ct as it never had been before, and probably never will be again. Secret societies of the middle ages, the myster- ies of Isis and Osiris and of Eleusis, and the revo lutionary secret societies of this and of other countries, all came in for a critical examination and premeditated condemnation and got both. The only importance atta ching to this reference is to recall what seems not to have been pointed out b efore, that it was during the period from 1828 to 1845, covering the anti-Masonic agitation, that the older among the best known national Greek-letter college fraternities were born.

If one can read of groups of college st udents at New York and New England centres of intelligence organizing Greek Le tter secret societies on the outward lines established by Phi Beta Kappa, Kappa Alpha, Sigma Phi, and Delta Phi without appreciating that they must have utiliz ed some of the raw material which was floating in the air, he must be deficient in imagination. The societies which saw the light in 1825 and 1827, Kappa Alpha, Sigma Phi, and Delta Phi, probably did not have elaborate rituals at that tim e. There are those who know they had them later. Then came Alpha Delta Phi and Skull and Bones in 1832, Psi Upsilon, in 1833, 'Mystical Seven in 1837, Beta Theta Pi in 1839, Chi Psi and Scroll and Key in 1841, and Delta Kappa Epsilon in 1844. In these one finds the practical inspiration for all that came a fter in the family of Greek-letter societies. That college fraternities multiplied fas t and grew rapidly during this period is more than significant. As a matter of fac t, some of the better known college fraternities give unmistakable evidence, to those of their members in a position to judge, of having rummaged in the bureau drawers of Freemasonry, Odd Fellowship, Forestry, the Templars, Knights of Malta, and other \"orders\" for ritualistic finery. Zeta Psi was founded by Fre emasons. Delta Psi, Columbia, 1847, was dressed up by some one who had access to rituals of the bastard Ma- sonic rites of Misraim and Memphis. Psi Upsilon hun g its harp low on the tree of symbolic Masonry while its offspring, Delta Kapp a Epsilon, read up on the Vehmgerichte and ancient Grecian mysteries before s electing a few ceremonials which would better fit nineteenth-century college l ife. Theta Delta Chi went far afield and returned with the Forestic legend, w hile the earlier \"Alpha Delts\" were evidently inspired by what they knew of Royal Arch Masonry and the Red Cross degree as conferred in commanderies of Masoni c Knights Templars. There would appear to be little room to-day for additions to the Greek-letter world. There are too many of these fraternities already, a nd while there is no tendency on the part of stronger societies to unite, weaker ones occasionally find their way into older or stronger fraternities. The latter, ha ving the prestige of age and a distinguished alumni, are naturally well-nigh invin cible. The general fraternities publish catalogues contain ing, as estimated, about 111,000 names, honorary about 6,500, professional 4 ,400, and the ladies, per- haps, 9,000; in all about 131,000, a large proporti on of which are of deceased members.

Delta Kappa Epsilon, or \"D. K. E.\" as it is usually called, beat all records at extension, by p lacing chapters at thirty-two colleges and universities between the year it was founded an d the outbreak of the war in 1861, going as far as Miami and the University of Michiga n in the \"West and to colleges in Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi and Loui siana at the South. The southern chapters were rendered dormant by the war, and sinc e 1866 the fraternity has been much more particular in creating branches, has made more of an effort to revive inac- tive chapters than to place new ones. Its original plan did not contemplate a general fraternity, but early opportunities for new chapter s presenting themselves, a plan for the propagation of \"D. K. E.\" was organized and was carried out with a thoroughness which, owing in part to the war, reacted upon the g eneral standing of the society. From 1870 to date the society has built upon far be tter foundation and with more care and skill, and ranks as the largest general college fraternity, with more than 12,000 members, nearly 10 per cent of the total membership of the world of Greek-letter societies. The impression has always prevailed that the parent chapter of \"D. K. E.\" exercises a dominant influence over the entire orga nization, but this has been denied. Certain it is that, at times, the tie between the Y ale \"Deke\" and his fraters from other colleges is not as strong as that between members o f different chapters of almost any other college fraternity. But this may be due to th e peculiar society system at Yale rather than to a peculiarity in the government or p ersonnel of Delta Kappa Epsilon. Its Harvard chapter ran against the anti-fraternity laws there in 1858 and practically ceased to exist as a chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon until 1863. It had not initiated members, for several years, but held meetings in Bo ston, where it became known as the \"Dicky Club.\" The chapter was revived as a soph omore society in 1863, and exists to-day, occasionally challenging attention when som e accident reveals to the public its ridiculous and at times reprehensible method of initiating candidates. Dicky Club is no longer \"D. K. E.\" Quite a number of chapters of \"D. K. E.\" have houses of their own; the \"D. K. E.\" club in New York stands as high as similar institutions there, and there are associations of \"D. K. E.\" alumni at a score of cities which hold annual reunions and cultivate the fraternal relations begu n during college life. The fraternity is governed by an advisory council which is incorpo rated. The badge resembles that of Psi Upsilon, except that in the centre of the black field the golden letters Delta Kappa Epsilon appear upon a white scroll. Much is made of armorial bearings, each chapter having a distinct blazon. The fraternity emblem is a lion rampant, in black, on a gold background. On its list of names of distinguished m embers are those of United States Senators M. C. Butler and Calvin S. Brice; Perry Be lmont, W. A Washburn, John D. Long, A. Miner Griswold, A. P.

On their rosters are found not only the names of undergraduates, but also those of men who long since left youth and folly far behind. Indeed, one now and then runs across a name that adds a certain dignity to the catalogue and becomes an inspiration for ambitious youth. Of these many find no small satisfaction in identifying themselves from time to time with the life of the various clubs and societies of which they were members when boys at col- lege ; they take a mild, half-melancholy pleas- ure in reminiscent talk, and delight to meet and wander with half-regretful sadness in halls where youth wears the crown. The charm of life in the society hall is much easier for one to imagine than for another to relate. A stereotyped phrase, \" mere boyish- ness,\" fails to explain it; a compendium of dry facts and arguments would be farther still from picturing the life that often masquerades un- der the thin veil of a half-pretended secrecy. More \"sweetness and light \" seems always to have been the goal to- wards which the fraternities strove, and the story of their development is a plain tale of natural and steady growth from small beginnings. Towards the end of the first quarter of the present century the social life of our colleges had become barren— not more barren, perhaps, than it had been for many years, but relatively so in view of the fact that life was becoming richer and the spirit of the times more liberal. Boys from families in which puri- tanical methods were obsolete naturally hated the puritanism of college discipline; they chafed at the petty decorum of the stuffy class-rooms, and fretted at the deadness of the iron-bound curriculum. Almost the only means of relaxa- tion countenanced by the faculties were open debating societies, which met on the college grounds, and to the meetings of which both professor and student might go. In view of the fact that students, from the days of Horace down, were wont to hold their preceptors as their natural enemies, the presence of profes- sors did not increase the popularity of these societies. Indeed, they languished. Here was the opportunity of the typical college fraternity. Of these societies the first to assume the characteristics that are now recognized as their essential, albeit it soon lost them, had been Phi Beta Kappa. It was founded at Williamsburg, Virginia, December 5, 1776, in the very room where Patrick Henry had voiced the revolu- tionary spirit of Virginia. The story is a sim- ple one: John Heath, Thomas Smith, Richard Booker, Armistead Smith, and John Jones, * For friendly assistance in the preparation\" of th is article the writer cordially acknowledges his oblig a- tion to Mr. John De Witt Warner, of New York.

The minutes are discouraging to those who would like to consider Phi Beta Kappa as a band of youthful enthusiasts planning a union of the virtuous college youth of this country, who were afterward to reform the world; and even more so to those who have declared infi- del philosophy to be its cult. Youths of fine feel- ings and good digestion, they enjoyed together many a symposium like that on the occasion of Mr. Bowdoin's departure for Europe, when, \" after many toasts suitable to the occasion, the evening was spent by the members in a man- ner which indicated the highest esteem for their departing friend, mixed with sorrow for his intended absence and joy for his future prospects in life.\" They called themselves a \" fraternity.\" More thoroughly to enjoy the society of congenial associates, to promote re- fined good-fellowship, was the motive of these hearty young students who founded the first of the true Greek-letter fraternities, with (to quote from its ritual) \" friendship as its basis, and benevolence and literature as its pillars \"— one which thrived in their day as its successors on the same basis flourish in ours. So far from being inspirers, or a product, of American national spirit, or of a union of the wise and virtuous to which they invited all known American col- leges, the only reference in their record to the Revolution is the single mention of the \" con- fusion of the times\" in the record of the final meeting; and the only recognition of the exist- ence of other colleges is the record of the grant- ing of charters for \"meetings\" at Harvard and Yale, which institutions were never mentioned again. Meanwhile Cornwallis was coming nearer, and after having chartered additional chap- ters,— Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta (Harvard), Eta (Yale), and Theta,— the Al- pha, or mother chapter, passed ou t of existence. From Epsilon and Zeta have descended the latter-day chapters of Phi Beta Kappa. Of the fate of Beta, Gamma, Delta, Eta, and Theta nothing is known. After a lapse of seventy years, William Short, of the mother chapter, at the age of ninety, traveled from Philadel- phia to Williamsburg and revived the Alpha, which, however, soon succumbed to the vicis- situdes of its college. It is not known what was its first follower. But of those whose ac- tivity have been continuous to date, Kappa Alpha, founded in 1825 at Union College, adopting with its Greek name, a badge planned similarly to that of Phi Beta Kappa (except that it was suspended from one corner, in- stead of from the center of one of its equal sides), and inspired by similar ends, began 552"},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"COLLEGE FRATERNITIES. 7 51 the career that has made it the mother of living Greek-letter societies. For Phi Beta Kappa has long since become an honorary, as distinguished from an active, institution, though the reunions of its chapters, especially of the old Zeta, now the \" Alpha of Massa- chusetts,\" founded at Cambridge in 1779, are still noteworthy events. Even before Phi Beta Kappa came into ex- istence, Oliver Ellsworth, afterward Chief-Jus- tice of the Supreme Court of the United States, had founded Clio Hall at Princeton, and a few years later, in 1769, Whig Hall arose at the same college with James Madison, afterward twice President of the United States, for its founder; and from that day to this these friendly rivals have never ceased to exert a healthful influence on the intellectual life of Princeton. These were the prototypes, and are the most vigorous survivals, of what, for nearly a cen- tury, were the most flourishing and numerous of student societies — the twin literary socie- ties, or \" halls,\" generally secret, and always intense in mutual rivalry, which have been in- stitutions at every leading college in the land. Another and a third, though less homogene- ous, class of student societies may be best described by noting separately its only im- portant examples — at Harvard and Yale. The Hasty Pudding Club of Harvard also took its rise in those interesting and forma- tive years just subsequent to the close of the Revolutionary war, and was founded, as its constitution says, \"to cherish the feelings of friendship and patriotism.\" For the display of the latter virtue the club for many years was wont to celebrate Washington's Birthday with oration and poem, with toasts and punch. Alas, for these degenerate days! Conventional theatricals have taken the place of poem and oration, though, for aught I know, the toasts and punch may yet survive. \" Two members in alphabetical order \"— so ran the old by-laws — \"shall provide a pot of hasty pudding for every meeting,\" and it is said that this practice is still religiously kept. That the banquet was not lightly considered by the old Harvard clubs may be seen in the tend- ency to exalt in the name of the club the peculiar feature of the club's fare, the Por- cellian taking its name from the roasted pig — classical token of hospitality — that one of its bright young members provided for the en- tertainment of his fellows on a time when the feast fell to his providing. But the Porcel- lian has not wholly given itself up to the things that go with banqueting, for no other college society has so fine a library as it pos- sesses. Indeed, its seven thousand well-se- lected and finely bound volumes might be coveted by many less fortunate small colleges. The A. D. Club is a younger rival of the \"Pork,\" and, in the comfort of its house, the brilliancy of its dinners, and its good-fellowship, is by no means inferior. The development of this species of undergraduate activity has taken a widely different and rather unique form at Yale. The Yale senior societies are the most secret and clannish of college societies. No outsid- ers ever enter their buildings, and their goings and comings are so locked in mystery that one can only guess what their aims and purposes are. A passion for relic worship and a taste for politics are generally ascribed to both, though the class of men taken by Scroll and Key differs widely from that chosen by Skull 553"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"75 2 COLLEGE FRATERNLTIES. and Bones — the men of the former being se- lected, it is supposed, for their social position and qualities of good-fellowship, while those of the latter are usually good scholars or prom- inent athletes. Thus we have the three classes of student societies — the old literary societies, still flour - ishing in the older colleges of the South, but languishing elsewhere, except at Princeton, where Clio and Whig are still the great insti- tutions of the student body, and at Lafayette, where the Washington and Jefferson are scarcely less prosperous; the peculiar local in- stitutions of Yale and Harvard, sui generis and not to be propagated; and the Greek-let- ter system of chaptered fraternities, the char- tered corporations of which are to-day the most prominent characteristic of American undergraduate social life. The interval of thirty-five years from the founding of Kappa Alpha to the outbreak of the civil war was the golden age of these fraternities. They sprang up and multiplied with a persistency that should forever make firm the doctrine of the strengthening power of persecution. They were not confined to any one grade of college or to any particular part of the country. They flourished every- where, and increased in number through almost every imaginable combination of the letters of the Greek alphabet. Many, of course, have vanished from the face of the earth. Of those that still remain, Delta Kappa Epsilon, founded at Yale in 1844, is the largest, and has now above 9000 members, representing 30 active chapters situated in 19 different States Psi Upsilon, originated at Union in 1833, en- rolls some 6600 members, distributed among 19 chapters in 10 States; and Alpha Delta Phi founded at Hamilton in 1832, has a mem- bership nearly as large. Delta Kappa Epsilon appears to have made good its claim to be re- ognized as a national institution; and while certain smaller fraternities are favorites in particular parts of the country, all barriers are rapidly disappearing before these three favour- ite societies in their march towards representa- tion at all the important colleges of the country. Though fraternities are organized less fre- quently now than formerly, because of the increased difficulty of competing with those that have been long established, still, as the colleges themselves grow, the chapters of the most flourishing fraternities grow with them, so that the increase of the system, as a whole, is both very regular and very considerable. Up to 1883, the date at which the latest general manual of the fraternities appeared, there were enrolled among the 32 general college frater- nities of this country, forming an aggregate of 505 active chapters, no less than 67,941 mem- bers, representing every possible profession and branch of business, every shade of religion and political opinion, and every State and Territory of the United States. But these figures by no means tell the whole storyof 554"},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"COLLEGE FRATERNITIES. 753 the growth and spread of the \"little\" college fraternities. Many colleges and advanced technical schools in every section of the country, besides welcoming the general fra- ternities to their privileges, have ambitiously started and preserved local fraternities that are limited or have no branches at other in- stitutions, but nevertheless often enjoy a large share of local patronage. These societies, of which there are 16 now in existence, had a membership of 4077. But this is not all. The female students, not to be outdone, about a dozen years ago began to organize sisterhoods, from which males were ignominiously debarred from membership, and had meantime suc- ceeded in building up 7 prosperous societies, with 16 chapters and 2038 members, situated mostly in co-educational institutions. When to this grand total of 74,056 names are added the large membership of the Princeton halls, the Harvard clubs, and the Yale senior societies, already described, together with the very nu- merous class organizations in various colleges, it may be seen how firm ahold the spirit of co- operation has taken upon the collegians of the country. The fraternities have grown far away from the persecutions of their early days, when the hands of all men and faculties were raised against them. Because they met in secret, and held themselves free from the intrusion of the faculty for one night in the week, and adorned their poor little badges with Greek letters, all evil and rebellious conduct was charged against them. Though their purposes were sensible enough, and good rather than evil has come from them, a nameless stigma of bad parentage still rests upon the whole system, to live down which, by an overplus of actual and visible good attainment, has not been possible till within recent years. But prejudice has an unequal contest with con- viction. Through persecution, and poverty of opportunity, and lack of means the new society men fought their way towards solid ground, finding in their struggles and in their ambi- tions for the success and honors of their fra- ternities an incentive and charm college life had till then never yielded. Whatever may have been the shortcomings of the American college boy of a quarter of a century ago, want of energy was not one of them. To take off his coat and go to work with his hands seemed to him the most natu- ral thing when he needed a society lodge. In this way was built, in 1855, the famous \"log- cabin \" of Delta Kappa Epsilon at Kenyon Col- lege, Gambier, Ohio. The site selected was a deep ravine, far away from any human dwell- ing. Neighboring farmers were hired to fell the trees and to raise the frame of this ark of a house, forty-five feet in length by ten in height. The entire chapter (including its youngest member, now an orator of national reputation several times elected to Congress) rested not until they had plastered the outside crevices with mud. Inside the room was nicely ceiled, and furnished with good tables and chairs, a carpet, and several pictures. The walls and roof of the building were ingeniously deadened with saw-dust and charcoal, so that not the remotest whispers could reach the ears of curious eavesdroppers, if any such should have the temerity to penetrate to the recesses of this sylvan retreat. \" A cooking-stove, with skillet, griddles, and pots complete, was the pride of the premises,\" writes an old member, \" where each hungry boy could roast his own potatoes, or cook his meat on a forked stick, in true bandit style.\" The building of this lodge gave a great im- petus to the owning of society homesteads. Before this the various chapters had been ac- customed to rendezvous stealthily in college garrets, at village hotels, or anywhere that circumstances and pursuing faculties made most convenient. But when the assurance was once gained that the fraternities might own their premises and make them permanent abiding-places, the whole system became straightway established on a lasting founda- tion. In 1861, at Yale, the parent chapter of 555"},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"754 COLLEGE FRATERNITIES. the same fraternity, Delta Kappa Epsilon, built for itself a two-story hall in the form of a well-proportioned Greek temple, and this proved to be the beginning of a long epoch of more and more elaborate house-building, the culmination of which has scarcely been reached at the present day. From the temple-shaped hall with its facili- ties for the routine work of the chapter, its dramatic and social festivities, the most enter- prising fraternities progressed gradually to- wards ample homesteads, thoroughly equipped for dealing with every phase of student life, in- cluding the furnishing of comfortable board and lodging, which, in some features, excelled the average dormitories. The work began in earnest about fifteen years ago, but the past two or three years have excelled all the others combined, both in an intelligent understanding of what was needed to make the houses thor- oughly habitable and creditable in appearance, and in the amount of superior work planned in detail or actually accomplished. A critical comparison of the specimens in existence re- veals the fact that pretty nearly every kind of known architecture has been tried. At Princeton one may see in the twin temples of Whig and Clio copies of the Ionic archi- tecture; at Cambridge, should he visit the A. D. Club, he could scarcely fail to notice that this hospitable mansion is the veritable traditional New England homestead, with its air of little pretense and much comfort. At Yale, \" Bones Hall\" is venerable and pictur- esque when covered by the foliage of its ivy; the magnificent building of \" Keys \" is of Moor- ish pattern; the new \" Wolf's Head \" society, at the same college, honors our ancestors in the \" Old Home\" by choosing a corbel-stepped gable, \" fretting the sky,\" to which the English and the Dutch of several centuries ago were noticeably partial; the stone Delta Psi lodges at New Haven and Hartford are veritable castles for strength and ruggedness of outline; no gentleman would need a more tasteful or finely located villa than one of the fraternity houses which he would find at Ithaca; while by Delta Kappa Epsilon at Amherst has been introduced, and by Sigma Delta Chi at Yale has been elaborated, what seems probable to become the reigning type — that of \" cloisters,\" in which are lodged the members, joined by gallery or covered way to the \" chapel,\" where are celebrated the rites of the chapter. If the fraternities as a whole have had a weakness, it has been for what they were pleased to believe was the \" Queen Anne style \"— a \" spread \" of red bricks, irregular, very irregular, tile roofs, and an unknown quan- tity of bowed windows, with the usual acces- sories of modern stained-glass \"Venetian\" blinds, and unlimited opportunity for portieres These experiments, as embodied by some ama- teur architect, most likely a well-meaning but untrained member of the chapter, have not al- ways been successful; but lately the bizarre mode has given way to better taste, and in all probability the next efforts of the fraternities 556"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"COLLEGE FRATERNLTIES. 755 at house-building will be characterized by solidity rather than show, by harmony rather than conspicuousness. Several of the college faculties have, with the consent of their boards of trustees, presented enterprising societies with valuable building-sites on their grounds; and where their invitations have been accepted, they have no cause to regret their generosity. In interior decoration the houses of the American college fraternities differ no less radically than in external appearance. At a Western lodge the members are often content with, and indeed think themselves fortunate if they have at their command, the bare neces- sities of life, while not a few of the wealthy chapter-houses of the East are furnished with all the luxury and refined taste of the high- est modern art as applied to club life. For instance, the lodge-room of the Delta Psi fra- ternity in New York City is magnificently fur- nished in Egyptian designs especially imported from Thebes for this purpose, at a cost of several thousands of dollars; and in the build- ings of the Alpha Delta Phi at Wesleyan, the Psi Upsilon at Cornell, the Chi Psi at Amherst, and the Sigma Phi at Williams may be found wood-work, furniture, and ob- jects of art which would be in no wise out of place in the most attractive of modern city homes. Several of the foremost chapters, such as the Sigma Phi, the Alpha Delta Phi, and the Kappa Alpha of Williams College, have been presented with valuable memorials by the friends or relatives of deceased members, which are introduced so as to form conspicu- ous features of the buildings. Thus the last of the three societies just named contains a strikingly beautiful emblematic window, de- signed by Tiffany & Co. of New York. The Samuel Eell's Memorial Hall, at Hamilton College, is itself a tribute to the brilliant young founder of the Alpha Delta Phi fra- ternity, who died after a short career of great promise at the Cincinnati bar as a law part- ner of the late Chief-Justice Chase. Other representative lodges have been built or beau- tified by the generosity of individuals. With the aid of rich sons and generous par- ents and friends, the loading down of college lodge-rooms might easily be carried to an unfortunate extreme, especially if a false spirit of rivalry should gain a foothold in our col- lege world. But at present there seems little danger of this. An honorable ambition pre- vails among the leaders of the best fraternities to make their homes complete and attractive in every particular, but beyond this they do not seek to go. The energies of those who 557"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"756 COLLEGE FRATERNITIES. have charge should be directed especially to adorning the chapter-houses with what illus- trates and improves student life in general, and with what is of particular importance to the members of the college or university at which the chapter-house is located. Of the value of the real and personal prop- erty belonging to the ten American college fraternities that are represented by at least one chapter-house each, and the leaders by five or more, it may safely be said that the sum is fast approaching a million of dollars; while numerous other fraternities and chapters have well-invested and rapidly accumulating building-funds. The fraternity literature is another interest- ing subject. The hideous reptiles and winged monsters, the burning altars and dungeon bars, and other such fantastic symbolism with which the magazines and newspapers of some of the fraternities are decorated, prove to cover in- teresting and oftentimes useful tables of con- tents, including reminiscences of college life and literary articles by prominent graduates, news-letters from the chapters at the different colleges, personal gossip concerning alumni, official notices from the officers of the frater- nity, editorial comments, and notes from exchanges. Two or three of these society periodicals have attained a large circulation. The fraternities have not confined their ener- gies to current papers, however, but have com- piled elaborate record books of their mem- bers, in the form of catalogues, which, besides containing the names and occupations of mem- bers, give succinct sketches of the chapters and the colleges at which they are situate, interest- ing tables of residence and relationship, and brief biographical sketches of the most distin- guished graduates. But decidedly the fresh- est and most characteristic literature possessed by the fraternities are their song-books, where, 558 "},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"COLLEGE FRATERNITIES. 757 in varied and not always correct verse, the youthful laureates have sung the praises of their clans, comrades, festal nights, the charms of good-fellowship, and many other such tempting themes for the imagination and the heart. Till about a dozen years ago few or none of the fraternities had a strong executive gov- ernment, but were managed by the oldest chap- ter, or by several chapters in turn, and by the hasty edicts of the general conventions of the order. But this system proving inadequate, the leaders conceived and boldly acted on the idea of taking the general executive administration of the college fraternities out of the hands of the undergraduate members, at. the same time appealing to the graduate members to assume an active share in their welfare. So far their success has been noteworthy. The graduate councils, which now form the executive de- partment of most of the leading fraternities, are ably managed, and graduate associations of the larger fraternities have been formed in most of the important cities. They hold re- unions, banquets, and business meetings, and in most essentials serve as graduate chapters of their orders, cementing old college ties and forming new ones between members of differ- ent colleges; and several of the fraternities, such as the Delta Psi, the Delta Phi, the Delta Kappa Epsilon, the Alpha Delta Phi, the Psi Upsilon, the Zeta Psi, and the Delta Upsilon, have lately taken the advanced step of estab- lishing in the large cities regular club-houses, which are well equipped, and well patronized by men of all ages; while at Chautauqua, the \"Wooglin \" club-house, with its ample accom- modations and grounds, is the summer head- quarters of the Beta Theta Pi, by a graduate corporation of which it is owned. The legislative functions of the fraterni- ties still rest with the annual conventions, which are usually held with the different undergraduate chapters in turn, when, be- sides the transaction of routine business, the several hundred students present from all parts of the country are occupied with social cour- tesies extended to them by local residents, and with literary efforts in the form of orations and poems, often delivered by members of the fraternity who have attained eminence in public life. In view of the facts already presented in the course of this narrative, a defense of the fra- ternities, a summing-up of all the reasons on which their existence and continuance might be justified, seems altogether superfluous. This one significant feature of the case may however be offered to the dubious without comment, as pointing its own moral — that so far, whenever the majesty of the law has been invoked by still obstinate faculties or trustees to drive the fraternities from their institutions, the law has upheld the continuance of the societies and the free rights of the students to join them, provided that in doing so they do not violate any of the proper functions of the college. It was so in 1879, when the faculty of the University of California tried to disband a society which had been allowed to erect a house on college land, and was met by the hostile criticisms of the entire press of that State; it was so in 1882, when the pres- ident of Purdue University, Indiana, striving to compel students entering his university not to join any of the societies, was pre- vented by a decision of the superior court of that State, and in the end resigned his office. The one notable exception to this rule is the case of the College of New Jersey. Here the faculty succeeded in expelling all the fraternities; but it was before the era of their house-building. All of those chapters 559"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"758 COLLEGE FRATERNITIES. which have built houses are now incorporated institutions, paying taxes on their real and personal property, and entitled to the full privileges and protection of local and State laws. They therefore appear to rest on a more solid basis than mere sufferance; and however ardently certain individuals may wish to see them abolished, it is extremely doubtful if even an organized crusade against them, headed by all the college presidents in the United States and the majority of the faculties under them, could succeed in doing more than to drive the reputable societies into a temporary seclusion, from which, in a few years, they would emerge stronger than ever. Such at least has been the case at many representative institutions. But the above supposition is relegated to the realms of the impossible when one dis- covers that a large portion of the educators referred to are themselves members of the fraternities, and in many cases actively associ- ated with their progress. This list includes such men as President Eliot of Harvard, Dwight of Yale, Walker of the Boston Institute of Technology, Seelye of Amherst, White of Cornell, Dwight of the Columbia Law School, Oilman of Johns Hopkins University, John- ston of Tulane, and Northrop of the Uni- versity of Minnesota. There is not a faculty of any size in the United States that does not contain society members, and few professorial chairs at the largest colleges are not filled by representatives of the leading fraternities. These \"little societies\" have supplied forty governors to most of the largest States of the Union ; and had in the last administration the President of the United States and the ma- jority of his Cabinet. On the Supreme Bench of the United States the fraternities are now represented by five of the associate justices. A summary, published in 1885, showed Alpha Delta Phi, Psi Upsilon, and Delta Kappa Epsilon to have furnished of United States senators and representatives 39, 25, and 36 respectively; while in the last Congress 13 representatives and 2 senators were members of the last-named fraternity alone; and in the membership of these 3 fraternities are included 24 bishops of the Protestant Episcopal Church. In the class-room they are represented by Whitney and Marsh; in the pulpit, by R. S. Storrs and Phillips Brooks; in the paths of literature, by James Russell Lowell, George William Curtis, Donald G. Mitchell, Charles Dudley Warner, Edward Everett Hale, and E. C. Stedman; in recent public life, by Presi- dents Arthur and Garfield, by Wayne Mac- Veagh, Charles S. Fairchild, Robert T. Lin- coln, John D. Long, William M. Evarts, Joseph R.Hawley,and William Walter Phelps. These gentlemen were not elected into the fraternities after graduation, but were active supporters of these organizations during their undergrad- uate days. Whatever, then, may be the short- comings of college secret societies, it is to their credit that their exponents are men noted for ability and prominence in every useful sphere of life, as well as for mere cult- ure and congeniality, while from end to end of the catalogued chapter-lists run in thick procession the starred names of the most brilliant and lamented of the young officers who fell in the battles of our civil war — in the blue and gray ranks alike. Judging the system by its deeds only, it is difficult to es- cape the conclusion that the best societies have in reality been groups of picked men among the fortunate few, comparatively speak- ing, who are able to incur the expense of a college education. In almost every college where the secret societies have flourished attempts have been made, some of them quite successful, to carry on local anti-secret societies; and there has existed for many years an anti-secret frater- nity, with chapters placed in different colleges, which has been patterned very closely after the societies calling themselves secret, both as to means and ends. But in one case only, that of Delta Upsilon, have the anti-secret orders 560"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"COLLEGE FRATERNITIES. 759 been able to keep pace with their secret rivals, in either the quality of their membership, their activity in college affairs, or their increase in material resources. Even here this has been the result of assimilation to the secret frater- nities, till now, so far as Delta Upsilon can ef- fect it, the distinction between itself and the secret fraternities is simply that the latter ex- poses somewhat more private business than do they, and, as to the rest, terms \" privacy \" what they call \" secrecy.\" Mr. Warner has said: Notwithstanding their formation is only in obedienc e to an ancient and universal love in human nature, t hey are attacked because they are secret. I suppose tha t some of them are guardians of the occult mysteries of Egypt and India, that they know what once was only known to augurs, flamens, and vestal virgins, and p er- haps to the priests of Osiris; others keep some sec ret knowledge of the formation of the alphabet, or pres erve the secret of nature preserved in the Rule of Three , and know why it was not the Rule of Four; while others, in midnight conclave, study the ratio of th e cylinder to the inscribed sphere. It matters not. I have never yet met any one who knew these secrets, whatever they are, who thought there was any moral dynamite in them; never one who had shared them who did not acknowledge their wholesome influence i n his college life. I mean, of course, the reputable socie- ties; I am acquainted with no other. The constitutions of many college frater- nities are now open to the inspection of fac- ulties; the most vigorous publish detailed accounts of their conventions and social gath- erings; nearly all of the homesteads are on oc- casions opened for the reception of visitors; their rites, ceremonies, and even the appear- ance of their sancta sanctorum, are quite ac- curately apprehended by rival societies — in short, the old shibboleth of secrecy is a myth rather than a reality. The shrewdest college presidents have long since discovered that to control undergraduate action with a firm though gentle hand they have only frankly to bespeak the aid and win the confidence and assistance of the fraterni- ties represented at their institutions. It is thu s that we come to see and to realize the im- portance of such unique departures from the traditional, ever-antagonistic relations be- tween the faculties and the students of large colleges as those lately put into operation at Amherst, Bowdoin, and other colleges; where all matters relating to the privileges and pen- alties of the students are adjusted to a code of laws which is administered, and from time to time amended, by a council of undergradu- ates, representing the fraternities, acting in concert with one or more members of the faculty. This simple and amicable relation- ship between those desiring to obtain knowl- edge and those desiring to impart it has already been attended with very gratifying results. Illustrated by such cases as that of Amherst and Bowdoin, and reenforced by the healthy tone of the fraternity press, which has not failed to wage war on what is reprehensible or deficient in our college life, and has labored to inculcate in their members the obligations which they owe to their college and to the members of rival societies as well as of their own, the words of General Stewart L. Wood- ford, in speaking of the early days of the societies, seem amply justified, and to promise even larger and still more excellent fruit in the near future: To no one cause more than to the fraternity move- menthas been due the altered conditions of college cult- ure. ... In matters of study and discipline each student is now largely guided by his personal predi lec- tions, by the advice of those whom he sees fit to c onsult, by the moral force of his chosen associates. These as- sociations are now determined in many colleges by t he Greek-letter societies or fraternities. 561"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"760 COLLEGE FRATERNITIES. That they can use without abusing their privileges was very well expressed by Presi- dent White, at the dedication of the new Psi Upsilon house at Cornell: Both theory and experience show us that when a body of young men in a university like this are giv en a piece of property, a house, its surroundings, its repu- tation, which for the time being is their own, for which they are responsible, in which they take pride, the y will treat it carefully, lovingly, because the hono r of the society they love is bound up in it. He added the following profound observa- tions as the result of his long experience, both here and abroad : One of the most unpleasant things in college life hitherto has been the fact that the students have c on- sidered themselves as practically something more th an boys, and therefore not under tutors and governors ; but something less than men, and therefore not ame- nable to the ordinary laws of society. Neither the dor- mitory nor the students' boarding-house is calculat ed to better this condition of things, for neither has an y in- fluence in developing the sense of manly responsibi lity in a student. But houses such as I am happy to say this society and its sister societies are to erect on these grounds seem to solve the problem in a far better w ay. They give excellent accommodations at reasonable prices; they can be arranged in such a manner and g ov- erned by such rules as to promote seclusion for stu dy during working-hours; they afford opportunities for the alumni and older students to exercise a good influe nce upon the younger; they give those provisions for th e maintenance of health which can hardly be expected in student barracks, or in the ordinary student boa rd- ing-house, and in the long run can be made more eco - nomical. But what I prize most of all in a house li ke this is its educating value ; for such a house tend s to take those who live in it out of the category of bo ys and to place them in the category of men. To use an old English phrase, it gives them \" a stake in the country.\" President Seelye of Amherst College, in an address on June 28, 1887, states, referring to the Greek-letter fraternities: The aim of these societies is, I say, improvement i n literary culture and in manly character, and this a im is reasonably justified by the results. It is not acci dental that the foremost men in college, as a rule, belong to some of these societies. That each society sho uld seek for its membership the best scholars, the best writers and speakers, the best men of a class, show s well where its strength is thought to lie. A studen t entering one of these societies finds a healthy sti mulus in the repute which his fraternity shall share from his successful work. The rivalry of individuals loses m uch of its narrowness, and almost all of its envy, when the prize which the individual seeks is valued chiefly for its benefit to the fellowship to which he belongs. Doubt- less members of these societies often remain narrow - minded and laggard in the race, after all the influ - ence of their society has been expended upon them, but the influence is a broadening and a quickening one notwithstanding. Under its power the self-conceit o r a young man is more likely to give way to self-cont rol than otherwise. . . . To represent all the fraternities as standing on anything like the same high plane as to membership, progress in the past, and pros- pects for the future would be misleading. My thoughts have naturally turned to the stand- ing, the equipment, the aspirations, or per- haps only the pretty dreams of those fraterni- ties which deserve to be ranked as the leaders in the race — that some day all the colleges of the United States will be veritable and ac- knowledged student democracies; that the fraternity buildings, though smaller than the college halls, will equal the latter in durability and completeness of appointment; that all the large cities will have graduate clubs, where the college fraternity man can renew the old associations that he cherished when a student. The leading fraternities are fond of affirm- ing the difference in their standard qualifica- tions for membership. Some venerate high scholarship; others pride themselves on the aristocracy of birth or wealth; still others recognize the claims of a heartier and more democratic spirit. This may be true; and yet in all of them there is enough good-fellowship to attract the cultured and enough culture to improve the sociable. They illustrate a law of nature and a law of man, in the tendency of atoms with affinities to form into groups. Hav- ing outgrown weaknesses and prejudices, they may be expected to enjoy a career of pros- perity. John Addison Porter.

One of the most remarkable features of college life at New Haven—The undergraduates' secret organizations, their fine club houses, their prestige and influence—\"Skull and Bones,\" \"Scroll and Key\" \" Wolf's Head,\" and o thers. By Rupert Hughes. IFE at Yale is almost devoid of so- ciety in the ordinary acceptance of the word. The stern, conservative Puri- tanism of the New Englanders who make New Haven their home, is inclined to frown on the levity and recklessness of college men, and seldom encourages their attentions to the local Priscillas; while the Yale man is too much wrapped up in the joys of campus life to miss the luxury. The only social life enjoyed by the average undergraduate is that of an occasional spasm like \"Prom.\" week, when the long starved appetite overfeeds on imported delicacies ; for a Yale man never thinks of taking a New Haven girl to a college event if he can, by hook or by crook, manage to bring to town a fair maiden, duly chaperoned, from his own city. But society life, as the Yale man in- terprets it, is quite the most important factor of college existence, and should be spelled with a capital \"S.\" It is in the mysterious halls of the secret societies that the student finds his dearest pleas- ures, and from them it is that the powers that direct the college de- mocracy issue. The first noticeable feature of the Yale societies is that they are only class societies, and not fraternal organiza- tions to be enjoyed for the three or four years of college life. The one important exception to this, Alpha Delta Phi, only emphasizes the strong class spirit at Yale by the many difficulties against which it has had to contend. And yet, though this fact is undeniable, the so- ciety life is, in a sense, similar to that where the fraternity membership extends through the whole course. The same men, in general, clique together and pass almost en masse through the differ- ent class societies, as through succes- sive strata, or through different degrees and orders. For example, a member of Kappa Omicron Alpha (one of the secret socie- ties at the Phillips Andover Academy, and probably the most powerful prepara- tory school society in the country) is almost certain of an election to one of the two Sophomore societies at Yale. This is an excellent introduction to the Junior societies, and they are but step- ping stones to that peak of Yale ad- vancement, a home in one of the Senior societies. The evolution, or retrogression, of the Yale chapters of various national four year fraternities, like Delta Kappa Epsi- lon and Psi Upsilon, into mere class societies, presents interesting features 563 L"},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY The Yale Campus. not to be dwelt upon here, further than to note how permanently the class prin- ciple is now imbedded in the college tradition and spirit. So firmly imbed- ded, indeed, is it, that many outside fraternities do not dare attempt an en- trance into Yale; and there is a strong sentiment even in Alpha Delta Phi that looks towards turning it also into a class society. The history of secret societies at Yale contains the obituaries of some fifteen victims to the rule of the survival of the fittest. Among these were several Freshman societies that withered and died under the disapproval of the faculty, which found too much reason for suspicion of any dark organizations among the immature and unassimilated new comers. The last of these to die was the local society, Gamma Nu, which for some time kept up a struggling ex- istence unknown to the faculty, but finally fell apart from internal weakness in 1889. This ended Freshman club life, and it is only natural, to the Yale mind, that the men who are forbidden canes, high hats, and a seat on what is left of the famous fence, should also be denied anything so dignified as a society. The policy of the faculty, though it does not forbid secret societies in toto, like the Princeton faculty, is, or at 564 "},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"S ECRET S OCIETIES AT Y ALE - M UNSEY ' S M AGAZINE , J UNE 1894 mysteries. The fact that almost any under- graduate can tell you both the names of the members and the loca- tion of their society r o o m s , does not weaken the bond of the members, however, so long as they suppose their secrets inviolated. The badges of these organizations are worn on the waistcoat, under the coat, and near the left armpit. That of He Boule is an owl with the initials under it, and that of Eta Phi is a mask. In choosing the least has been, more or less adverse to Sophomore or- ganizations also. In spite of this, two Sophomore so- cieties maintain a flourish- ing existence. They were founded respectively in 1875 and 1879, and are called He Boule and Eta Phi. In some respects these are the most powerful cli- ques in college, since the high place of society mem- bership in the Yale mind cannot be overestimated, and since initiation into one of these two clubs practically insures admis- sion to those of the Junior and Senior years. The power of He Boule and Eta Phi is mightily strength- ened, too, both in the firm- ness of fraternal ties and in the underground workings of college politics, by their almost absolute secrecy.

The initiations are now nothing more than picturesque, since the lamentable death of Wilkins Rustin, '94, in the spring of 1892. He was blindfolded and instructed to run at his highest speed along an unfrequented street. In his enthusiasm he outstripped the two men in whose charge he was. Mis- understanding a cry of warning from them, he suddenly swerved from his 566 "},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"S ECRET S OCIETIES AT Y ALE - M UNSEY ' S M AGAZINE , J UNE 1894 direct course and ran into the sharp pole of a wagon, receiving injuries that proved fatal. The keen anxiety and deep grief of his initiators acquitted them of anything more serious than blind folly, but the faculty very wisely forbade all initiation further than the taking of the oath. Indeed, in defer- ence to the storm of indignation through- out the country, they almost decided to wipe out the societies altogether; but, fortunately for the delight of Yale life, this radical step was not taken. On the night of initiation, which is always the last Friday in May, the two societies march about the campus in h o o d s and gowns, singing their rival songs as they march. They then retire to their halls, where the formal initiation takes place, and a local burlesque is given as a welcome to the new comers. In order to make a whole night of it, the two societies indulge in a hilarious game of base ball, between day- light and sunrise, those who are not on the nines usually falling asleep in a shed near by. Perhaps the strongest bond of fellowship in the two Junior societies, be- sides the conviviality they foster, is the large number of very creditable plays written and per- formed in their halls, the works of Bolt- wood, Perkins, and Paine deserving especial mention. The connection of these societies with their national organ- izations grows weaker and weaker every year, and many advo- cate its com- plete dissolu- tion. Perhaps their princi- pal value in the eyes of the students is their service in securing admission to the societies of the Seniors, who retain a limited voice and vote in the Junior clubs. The expenses are not high, being seldom more than seventy five dollars for the year. The Psi Upsilon badge shows two clasped hands and a monogram; that of ''Deke\" is a scroll bearing the word ''Yale,\" and the initials of the society's name. This is as good a place as any to refer to two societies which are, in a sense, rivals of the two last named, though they are hardly formidable opponents. 567"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY Zeta Psi, commonly known as ''Zate,'' is a two year society which usually takes in fifteen or twenty of the men that fail of admission to Delta Kappa Epsilon and Psi Upsilon. Though Zeta Psi is not held in very high favor at Yale, it has a handsome chapter house, and a number of very good men on its list of members. Its pin is a monogram. the spirit of the college is against a three year society, and it is hard to get an ambitious student to lose the possi- bility of a place in the more popular clubs even for a sure membership in Alpha Delta Phi.

It is a three year society, and leads a somewhat pre- carious existence, harrowed as it is by its inevitable conflict, first against the power and activity of the Sophomore societies, and later against the dolce far niente of the Juniors. Unlike a member of Zeta Psi, the \"Alpha Delt\" stands a fair chance of election to the poorest of the three Senior societies and '' a shadow of a show'' for the two better ones. But great history, but suffers for lack of a chapter house. Money is now being collected for this purpose, however, and the society has already bought a lot on Hillhouse, the most elegant avenue in New Haven. Alpha Delta Phi was founded in 1836 but was extinct for many years, and was only reorganized in 1888, the year that saw the birth of Zeta Psi.

They all have grad- uate organizations, and are quite an ex- pensive luxury. disappointments may have embittered his lot, if he can only find a haven in one of the Senior societies, his cup of joy is full. Omitting mention of Phi Beta Kappa, the association of men that have taken honors for scholarship, and Chi Delta Theta, composed of the edi- tors of the Yale Literary Magazine (founded respectively in 1780 and 1821), the social societies are three in number : Skull and Bones, founded in 1832, Scroll and Key 1842, and a newcomer, Wolf's Head, born only eleven years ago.

By this I do not mean that it is a fat men's club, but that it takes the fifteen men who stand head and shoulders above their class for distinction—literary, scholas- tic, athletic, social, or otherwise. An impression prevails, however, that here, as with the other societies, in many 569 "},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"F LESHING O UT S KULL & Bones - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY cases heredity has much to do with the selection, and that the son or younger brother of a former member is often pre- ferred to more capable candi- dates. But this is stoutly contradicted by Bones men. The Bones badge consists of a gold skull and cross bones over the number \"322,\" and it is worn on the lower left side of the waist- coat. ''Keys,\" whose pin is worn on the neck scarf, and is a gold key on a scroll with the letters \"C. S. P.\" and \"C. C. I.,\" is not far behind Bones in prominence. It takes annually the fifteen most con- vivial and socially prominent men left by Bones. Wolf's Head is much less highly rated, and instances are not wholly unknown wherein students un- noticed by either Bones or Keys have yet refused to join Wolf's Head. Its pin is a golden wolf's head transfixed on a loop, and it has a magnificent chapter house. The day of election into these societies is perhaps the quaintest feature of Yale life. It is called \"tapping time,\" or \"slap day,'' and falls on the third Thursday in May, at five in the afternoon. Then all the anxious Juniors congregate in front of what is now used as '' the fence,'' and pray that they may be chosen. Soon a solemn Senior issues from one of the society halls and threads the crowd till he finds the man he has been dele- gated to notify. He deals him a vigorous slap on the back, and says stern- ly, \"Go to your room.\" Amid wild cheering, the lucky man obeys mutely, followed by his slapper, who says to him, \"Will you accept an election to the society known as Skull and Bones?\" and goes back in silence to the hall whence he came, while the happy Junior returns to re- ceive the envious congratu- lations of his friends. About the same time a Keys man. with a Wolf's Head man in his wake, goes through the same evolutions. Between ''tapping time\" and initiation a week elapses During this the slapper and the slapped preserve a sacred mutual silence, except on one occasion, when the new man is notified of the time and place of the awful ordeal, which is consum- mated in the dark recesses of the mysterious chapter house. Besides these Academic societies there are many others at Yale. Among those not yet mentioned are Phi Gamma Delta, a very small university chapter of the national fraternity; the University Club, 5 70 "},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":"S ECRET S OCIETIES AT Y ALE - M UNSEY ' S M AGAZINE , J UNE 1894 which is like any city club; the two Law School soci- eties, Corbey Court and Book and Gavel, and the societies of theSheffield Scienti- fic School. These last are quite as im- portant as the minor Academic societies, and deserve more detailed mention than space permits, notably \"Book and Snake,'' or Sigma Delta Chi, whose club house, \"The Cloister,\" is the handsomest in New Haven; \"Berzelius,\" named after the great chemist; the \"Tea Company,\" or Delta Psi; and Chi Phi, besides which there are three smaller societies, Theta Psi, Theta Delta Chi, and Delta Phi. There are many interesting customs in vogue among these secret brotherhoods, such as their habit of returning home from meetings in absolute oblivion of each other and everybody else, walking at opposite sides of the pavement and crossing each other's paths on entering their houses. In the training seasons, too, the athletes are always escorted home from meetings at ten o'clock. The Academic Sophomores meet on Friday nights ; the Juniors, on Tuesdays; the Sheffield men, on Thursdays; and the Seniors, on Thursdays and Saturdays. Most inexplicable to an outsider is the fact that a Yale man is unwilling to breathe a word about his college society, and seemingly feels insulted at any mention of it. Even the most bewitch- ing young woman is warned not to make any remark about his badge (which, by the way, is supposed never to leave his person, even during a bath, when it is carried in his mouth) for the student will feel compelled to receive your ques- tion in absolute silence. The ethics of the subject cannot be discussed here, but it is noteworthy that the chief arguments against these or- ganizations come from men who have failed of admission to them, and that Yale's greatest alumni have been mem- bers of the secret societies. 571"},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"S CRIBNER ' S M ONTHLY .

The city is built at the head of a narrow bay four miles long, and its suburbs stretch back across the plain to the foot of a range of trap dikes. The boldest members of this range are the two sheer and naked precipices known as East and West Rock. These are some 370 feet high, and the most striking objects in sight, as one sails up the winding channel of the bay, or enters the city by rail across the trestle-work over the \"flat marshes, that look like monster billiard-tables with hay-stacks lying about for balls.\" The following somewhat rose-colored pict- V OL . XI.—49. ure of the city, is painted by Willis from his recollections of it as an undergraduate in 1827: \"If you were to set a poet to make a town, with carte blanche as to trees, gardens and green blinds, he would probably turn out very much such a place as New Haven. The first thought of the inventor of New Haven was to lay out the streets in parallel- ograms ; the second was to plant them from suburb to water-side, with the magnificent elms of the country. The result is that, at the end of fifty years, the town is buried in leaves. If it were not for the spires of the churches, a bird flying over on his autumn voyage to the Floridas would never mention 573 "},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":" having seen it in his travels. The houses are something between an Italian palace and an English cottage,—built of wood, but, in the dim light of those overshadowing trees, as fair to the eye as marble, with their triennial coats of paint; and each stands in the midst of its own encircling grass-plot, half buried in vines and flowers, and facing outward from a cluster of gardens divided by slender palings, and filling up with fruit- trees and summer-houses the square on whose limit it stands. Then, like the vari- colored parallelograms upon a chess-board, green openings are left throughout the town, fringed with triple and interweaving elm rows, the long weeping branches sweeping downward to the grass, and, with their inclos- ing shadows, keeping moist and cool the road they overhang.\" In spite of its growth from a small university town to a city of over 50,000 inhabitants, New Haven keeps its rural look. This is owing partly to its architecture, and partly to its tree-planting traditions, inherited from the times of James Hillhouse, who set out the great elms that now shadow the older streets. The immediate suburbs of New Haven are far from imposing,—acres of flat ground covered with rows of small wooden houses, of a dreary sameness of pattern, with here and there a waste lot inter- sected by foot-paths, and nibbled by bleating goats that tug restlessly at their tethers. Yet even in these unsightly outskirts, and wherever the hand of the real estate speculator has been at work laying out new \" boulevards,\" there are planted ranks of young elms, the germ of future Temple streets. Hence, from the top of East or West Rock, the straggling town, with its wooden houses and shade trees, looks like an over- grown village. From the upper stories of Divinity Hall in June the tree-tops of the City Green and the College Campus strike on the eye as a sea of billowy ver- dure, the church steeples and the belfries, clock towers and gables of the University, seeming not so much to emerge therefrom as to be themselves the craft of some fan- tastic navy sailing on the leaves. The round 574 observatory of the Athenaeum serves for the cheese-box turret of a Monitor, and the steep roof-ridge of Durfee, with chimneys for"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"smoke-pipes, does duty as a hog-backed Merrimac. The scenery about New Haven is uncom- monly rich and varied, tempting constantly to holiday walks and sails, and lending a romantic charm to the memories of under- graduate life. There is an intimate blending of sea-side and inland. Brackish creeks empty and fill their sluices with tide water, at the bases of cliffs miles from the sea. Following a path through woods, you come out suddenly on the borders of a salt marsh, where gulls are flying about. Lying under the trees of an orchard seemingly in the heart of the continent, you lift your eyes and see across the clover-tops the sparkle of the sun on the waters of the Sound, and the sail of a vessel bound for New York. You could put out your hand and touch it, lying under the apple-trees. New Haven was settled in 1638 by a company of immigrants from London, who bought the land from Momauguin, sachem of the Quinnipiacs, \"for 12 coats of English cloth, 12 alchymy spoons, 12 hatchets, 12 hoes, 2 dozen knives, 12 porringers and 4 cases of French knives and scissors.\" Like other New England towns, it has its romance of colonial history. In 1661 Whalley and Goffe, two of the regicide judges of Charles the First, came to New Haven. Tradition connects their names with a sort of den, formed by two bowlders on the back of West Rock, where they lay hidden while the King's officers were making search for them in the town. The Judges' Cave is the first shrine to which the Freshman makes pilgrimage, and on one of the bowlders some lover of liberty, whose enthusiasm outran his orthog- raphy, has cut the inscription: \"Oposition to tyrants is obedience to God.\"* Long before the close of the 17 th century, the project of a college in the Colony of Connecticut had been mooted. The dis- tance of Harvard College in those days of unrapid transit (mostly on horseback) was felt as a serious evil. But not until the year 1700 did the movement take definite shape. In that year ten of the foremost ministers in the colony, nominated by general consent, assembled at New Haven, and formed them- selves into a society for founding and car- rying on a collegiate school. Later in the year tradition reports that they again came * For a fuller account of the topography and an- tiquities of New Haven, see President Dwight's \"Statistical Account of New Haven;\" and Prof. Dana's \" Walks about New Haven,\" in the \" Col- lege Couraut\" for 1868-9. together at Branford, each bringing a num- ber of books—in all some forty folios— which he laid on the table with the words: \" I give these books for founding a college in this colony.\" So that the library is to be regarded as the corner-stone of the univer- sity. In 1701, the society was incorporated by Act of the Colonial Assembly, in conse- quence of a petition numerously signed, set- ting forth that \"from a sincere regard to, and zeal for, upholding the Protestant religion by a succession of learned and orthodox men, they [the petitioners] had proposed that a collegiate school should be erected in this colony, wherein youth should be instructed in all parts of learning, to qualify them for public employments in church and civil state.\" Abraham Pierson, of Killingworth [Ken- nelworth], was. chosen Rector of the school, and held, office till his death in 1707. In the summer of 1874 a bronze statue of Yale's first president was erected on the college grounds in front of the Art Gallery, and un- veiled at Commencement with appropriate ceremonies. The statue was designed by Launt Thompson, and presented to the col- 575"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"lege by Mr. Charles Morgan, of New York.

These modest beginnings recall the affectionate Puritan scholar have something typical and even prophetic, carrying the mind back to the times when, Teucro duce et auspice Teucro, the students were \"weekly caused memoriter to recite the Assembly's Catechism in Latin and Ames's Theological Theses.\" A memo- rial of Rector Pierson is also preserved in the library—a square oaken chair of the true antique solidity. The school was located provisionally at Saybrook. The first student on its rolls was Jacob Hemingway, who took his Bachelor's degree in 1704. He entered college in March, 1702, and continued in his sole per- son to represent the whole body of under- graduates until September of the same year, when the number was swelled to eight, who were distributed into classes according to their scholarship. At the same time the Faculty received an addition by the appoint- ment of Mr. Daniel Hooker as tutor. The first Commencement was held at Saybrook in 1702, and some honorary degrees con- ferred ; but there was no proper graduating class until the following year, when the Triennial Catalogue makes the following record: 1703. *Johannes Hart, A.

How the Seniors kicked about the Fresh- man class of one!\" It should be borne in mind that in 1700 Connecticut had a poor and thinly scattered agricultural population of little more than 15,000. During its first seventeen years the new college led a wandering life. Rector Pier- son lived at Killingworth, and taught his classes there. The Rector who succeeded him resided at Milford with the Seniors, the lower classes being instructed by the tutors at Saybrook. In 1716, many of the students being dissatisfied with Saybrook, seceded to Wethersfield and put themselves under the teaching of Mr. Elisha Williams, who thus became a kind of tutor extraordinary. The few who remained at Saybrook shorthly after fled from the small-pox to East Guil- ford. There was much local jealousy touch- ing the permanent settling of the college; New Haven, Hartford, Saybrook, Wethers- field and Middletown, all making bids for it. 576 YALE ART BUILDING."},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"The up-river interest was in the minority in the Corporation, and memorialized the As- sembly. But most of the Trustees declaring for New Haven, the college was removed thither in 1717—not, however, without vio- lent opposition. The Governor and Council had to assemble at Saybrook to help the sheriff. The bridges between Saybrook and New Haven were broken down, and the library was a week on the road. The carts in which the latter was carried were attacked, and two hundred and sixty volumes lost or destroyed in the scuffle. The Commencements at Saybrook had been mostly private. A public Commence- ment was held at New Haven in 1718. A few recalcitrant members of the graduating class still lingered at Wethersfield, where a rival Commencement took place. But the up-river faction was finally conciliated, and Mr. Elisha Williams was appointed tutor, and afterward, in 1725, Rector. Meanwhile a house for the reception of the college had been built at New Haven, and was dedi- cated on Commencement Day. It stood in the south-eastern corner of the yard, near\" the fence,\" whose top rail, crowded with singers in the summer evenings, now forms the fav- orite lounging-place of the undergraduates (see page 768). This building was of wood, three stories high, with steep roof and dor- mer windows, and had, besides chambers for the scholars, a hall, library and kitchen. A part of it was standing as late as 1782. About the time of the removal of the college to New Haven, there were received from Gov. Elihu Yale, of London, a large box of books, the portrait (by Sir Godfrey Kneller) and the arms of King George, and € 200 sterling worth of English goods. The por- trait is preserved in the Art Gallery, but the coat-of-arms was destroyed at the, time of the Revolution. In acknowledgment of this gift the Trustees \" solemnly named\" the new building Yale College; \"upon which,\" pro- ceeds the contemporary account,\" the Hon. Col.

After which they sung the four first verses of the 65th Psalm, and so the day ended.\" Elihu Yale, whose name was thus almost accidentally bound up forever with the for- tunes of a university whose future greatness he surely could not have foretokened, was born in New Haven in 1648. He was educated in England, and made a fortune in the East Indies, where he was made Governor of Fort St. George, now Madras. \"He was a gentleman,\" says President Clap, \"who greatly abounded in good hu- mor and generosity as well as in wealth.\" A grandson of Gov. Yale presented the col- lege, in 1789, with an original full-length portrait of its distinguished sponsor. From this is taken the picture which figures on the cover of the \" Yale Literary Magazine,\" but the elegiac couplet just beneath it, \"Dum mens grata manet nomen laudesque Yalenses Cantabunt suboles unanimique patres.\" comes from a MS. inscription, under an engraving of Gov. Yale sent to the college at an earlier period. The college is also in possession of a silver snuff-box once belong- ing to its benefactor, having a tortoise-shell lid with medallion, coat-of-arms, and the motto Praemium virtutis gloria. The fol- lowing lines, from Yale's epitaph in the church-yard at Wrexham in Wales, are cu- rious, and have been often quoted : \" Born in America, in Europe bred, In Afric travelled and in Asia wed, Where long he lived and thrived; at London dead.

But these chairs were slenderly endowed, and often empty. Sometimes the President per- formed the duties of a Professor, as well as his own. A house for the Rector had been built in 1722. A second President's house was built in 1799, and was standing in 1860. In lay- ing the foundations of Farnam Hall, in 1869, a bottle of mulberry wine was dug up from the ruins of the President's cellar, \"which, if any have tasted, they have far exceeded was modeled upon \"red Massachusetts\" at Cambridge, and was described in the dedi- cation ceremonies as cedes hoc nitida et splendida Aula Connecticutensis.

Down to 1767, the names of under- graduates were arranged, not alphabetically, but in order of rank. The first name in the class of 1725 is Gurdon Saltonstall, the Governor's son. Then follow names of sons of clergymen, lawyers, artisans, and trades- men. \"Every student,\" runs one of the old laws,\" shall be called by his sir name, except he be the son of a nobleman, or a knight's eldest son.\" As between the col- lege classes, a strict subordination was en- forced, and a somewhat laborious etiquette prevailed between Faculty and students. The Freshmen were almost in the condition of fags in the English public schools. The following statutes from a book of \"Freshman Laws\" seem incredible, but were gravely meant, and put in practice: \"The Freshmen, as well as other under- graduates, are to be uncovered, and are for- bidden to wear their hats (unless in stormy weather) in the front door-yard of the Presi- dent's or Professor's house, or within ten rods of the person of the President, eight rods of the Professor, and five rods of a tutor.\" \"A Freshman shall not play with any members of an upper class without being asked.\" \"In case of personal insult, a Junior may call up a Freshman and reprehend him. A Sophomore, in like case, must obtain leave from a Senior, and then he may discipline a Freshman.\" \"Freshmen shall not run in college-yard,. or up or down stairs, or call to anyone through a college window.\" The Academic costume of cap and gown was worn at Yale in the last century. A curious wood-cut, \" View of Yale College,\" in the library, printed at New Haven in 1786, represents South Middle College and the Athenaeum, with figures of President Stiles, tutors, and scholars, walking in the yard. Some are in cap and gown, others in frock coat, cocked hat, and peruke. Each has a little spot of green to stand on, like the wooden lozenges which support the feet of the dramatis personm in a Noah's Ark. The figure of President Stiles is fearfully and wonderfully made. The scholars were not allowed to use English in addressing each other, but must talk in Latin. Discipline was maintained chiefly by a system of graded fines. Fresh- men and \"commencing Sophomores\" were sometimes cuffed or boxed on the ear by the President in a solemn and formal manner in chapel; but there seems to have been no 579"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":" instance at Yale of that bodily flogging some- times administered at Harvard—notably in the case of Thomas Sargent, of painful memory, who was \"whipped before the scholars\" in 1674. We cannot pause to describe those shadowy functionaries, the Beadle and the Scholar of the House, or do more than allude in pass- ing to the College Butler, a licensed monopolist, who held his buttery in the ground floor front corner room in the south entry of South Middle, wherefrom he dis- pensed to such as had money or credit \"cider, me- theglin, strong beer, together with loaf sugar ('saccharum rigidum'), pipes, tobacco, etc,\" — being, indeed, a sort of ancient and official \"Hoad.\" He it was who fur- nished the candles which glimmered in the chapel at early prayers in the dark win- ter mornings. He had charge of the college bell, and a disorderly student was sometimes, with a certain grim humor on the part or the authorities, appointed to the office of \" Butler's waiter,\" and compelled to ring the bell for a week or two. In 1729 arrived in Rhode Island, Dean, afterward Bishop, George Berkeley, with a train of English gentlemen. He came to the province in furtherance of his romantic project of founding a college in Bermuda to chris- tianize the Indians, and be the center of civilization in the New World. The imag- inative spirit in which Berkeley undertook this enterprise appears from his fine \" Verses on the Prospect of Planting Arts and Learn- ing in America.\" The closing stanza is familiar, the first line having passed into proverb : \"Westward the course of empire takes its way; The four first acts already past, A fifth shall close the drama with the day; Time's noblest offspring is the last.\" In Rhode Island Berkeley sojourned three years, waiting for the £20,000 promised him by the British Ministry toward his Ber- muda College. This, of course, never came. Sir Robert Walpole's statesmanship was any- thing but visionary, and he found more prac- 580 "},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"tical uses for the money at home. In the interior of the island Berkeley built himself a mansion, still standing, which he named Whitehall, in a pleasant valley, neighbor to a hill that commands the land and the ocean with its outlying islands. Here he lived in scholarly retirement, writing his \"Minute Philosopher,\" and the dialogues of \"Alci- phron.\" In 1719 Timothy Cutler had been chosen Rector of Yale College. He is described and the Trustees excused Mr. Cutler from any further service as Rector, and accepted Mr. Brown's resignation of his tutorship. It is honorable to both sides that the new con- verts never put themselves in hostility to the college. Mr. (afterward Dr.) Johnson in particular continued zealous in its interests. He had accompanied Cutler to England, and received ordination and degrees.* In 1754 he was chosen first President of King's (now Columbia) College. His son was edu- by President Stiles as \"a great Hebrician and Orientalist,\" \"a noble Latin Orator,\" and a man of \"a high, lofty, and despotic mien.\" \"He made a grand, figure as the head of a college. But his head being at length turned with the splendor of Prelacy, and carried away with the fond enterprise of Episcopizing all New England, he, in 1722, turned Churchman, left his Rectorate of Yale College, and was re-ordained by the Bishop of Norwich, and was honored with the Doctorate in Divinity from Oxford and Cambridge. Returning, he settled in Bos- ton, but failed of that influence and emi- nence which he figured to himself in pros- pect.\" Rector Cutler drew after him a number of ministers, including Mr. Samuel Johnson, a former tutor, and Mr. Daniel Brown, then acting tutor in the college. This apostacy created alarm throughout New England, cated at Yale, and became, like his father, President of King's College. On Berkeley's arrival at Newport, John- son visited him there, and a friendship was begun which had important results for Yale. The two friends kept up a correspondence, partly on philosophical matters, and John- son embraced Berkeley's idealism, as did also, though independently, a thinker in some respects greater than Berkeley—Jona- than Edwards, once a pupil of Johnson at Yale. Johnson embodied the Berkeleian system in his \"Elementa Philosophica,\" printed at Philadelphia in 1752 by Benjamin Franklin. Through Johnson, Berkeley be- came interested in \"the college at New- haven,\" and in 1732, on his return to Eng- land, conveyed to the Trustees his farm of * He is said to have visited Pope, and brought home cuttings from the Twickenham willow, which he planted at Stratford, Conn. 581 "},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":" ninety-six acres at Whitehall, the rent to be appropriated to three scholarships, awarded for excellence in Greek and Latin, deter- mined by a competitive examination in the presence of the President and the \"Senior Episcopal Missionary of the Colony or Prov- ince of Connecticut.\" In 1733 he sent the college nearly 1,000 volumes, valued at € 500—the best collection of books that had ever been brought at one time to Amer- ica. The collection included the chief works of classical literature and philosophy, the Greek and Latin Fathers, church history, Anglican divinity, modern philosophy, math- ematics, natural history and medicine, Eng- lish poetry, and modern French literature. Berkeley kept up a correspondence with the college till his death in 1753. His name has been kept alive at Yale, not only by the Berkeley scholarships,—\" the Dean'sbounty\" they were formerly called,—but by many other mementos; among others by his por- trait now in the Art Gallery, painted by Smibert, an English artist who came with him to America as Professor of Fine Arts in the future University of Bermuda. Smibert staid in America after Berkeley's departure, and died at Boston. Copley was one of his pu- pils. The painting shows Berkeley standing by a table, with his hand resting on a volume of Plato, and surrounded by his family. North Middle College, finished in 1803, was at first called Berkeley Hall, but \"swell names\" have never flourished at Yale. In 1869 a Berkeley Association was started by the Episcopal students in college. During the long administration of President Clap, from 1739 to 1766, there arose in the colony serious dissatisfaction with the college management. In 1740 the great revival preacher, White- field, visited New England, and, raised by his eloquence, a kind of religious inflammation. All sorts of Enthusiasts and Separatists started up to trouble the decorous orthodoxy that had hitherto reigned unbroken in Con- necticut. Authority everywhere took ground against the movement, and the heads of the college criticised Whitefield and his followers in a printed document. David Brainerd, then a Junior in college, and afterward a famous missionary among the Indians, a man of fervent and even fanatical piety, said of a 582 "},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":" certain tutor Whittelsey, that \"he had no more of the grace of God than that chair.\" For this offense, and for attending against the rules a Separatist meeting in New Haven, he was expelled from college. This and other harsh measures gave great offense to many in the colony. Anonymous pamph- lets were directed against the government of the college; its orthodoxy was questioned, and complaints were made of its system of discipline and instruction; the students were encouraged in insubordination by civilians in New Haven. Finally, in 1763, a memo- rial was presented to the Assembly, praying the appointment of a Commission of Visita- tion to inquire into and rectify the abuses in the college. In answer, President Clap presented an address, showing conclusively that no visitorial powers resided in the Legislature, but in the real founders of the college, the ten ministers who made the first donation of books, and their successors, the Trustees under the charter of 1701, and the President and Fellows of Yale College in New Haven under the amended charter of 1745. Of the legal ability shown in this argument Chancellor Kent spoke in the highest terms. The Assembly took no action on the memo- rial. This controversy was of great value to the College, as it established thus early in its history the independence of the corporation from State interference. Nevertheless the college continued for a time widely unpopu- lar, and a fresh grievance was added when, in 1765, two of the tutors who had become infected with Sandemanian principles were forced by the President to resign. President Clap was a man of ability and firmness of will, who devoted himself with untiring- fidelity to the interests of the college. The study of mathematics and natural philosophy especially received impetus from his teach- ing; but he seems to have been rigid and intolerant. During the Revolution the college was all but broken up. Owing to the high price of provisions at New Haven, the Freshmen were removed to Farmington, and the Juniors and Sophomores to Glastonbury, the Seniors alone staying at New Haven under Tutor Dwight. No public Com- mencement was held between 1777 and 1781. It was voted that the college bell might be transported to Glastonbury if the inhabitants would pay the cost of its con- veyance. In July, 1779, New Haven was occupied by the British. The invading force landed on the shore of the Sound west of the town, and advanced 583"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"along the Milford turnpike. Beyond West Riyer they were met by the militia, including anumber of undergraduates. These irregular troops were soon dispersed after a skirmish. Among other citizens, ex-President Daggett had shouldered his fowling-piece and gone forth to battle. He was taken prisoner, put at Presidents of the college was Dr. Ezra Stiles, who served from 1777 to 1795. He was the best scholar of his time in New England, and, it is said, would have been elected President of Harvard, but for his being a graduate of another college. He had an eager and credulous curiosity, which led the head of the British column, and prodded with bayonets into town. Being a portly man, \"subject to continual dissolution and thaw,\" and the day being intensely hot, Dr. Daggett sustained injuries from his forced march at the point of the bayonet, which are believed to have hastened his death. In this skirmish Major Campbell, reputed the handsomest man in the British army, was shot by a farmer from behind a stone wall. He was buried in the fields nearby, and the spot is still marked by a small stone, and sometimes visited by the curious. It is said that the first body of troops reviewed by Washington after his appointment as Com- mander-in-Chief, was a company of Yale students that he put through the maneuvers on the New Haven green while on his way to take command at Cambridge. By reason of the depreciation and fluctuation of the currency during the Revolution and just after, the salaries of the college officers were paid in terms of beef, pork, wheat, and Indian corn, a medium not so elastic as Continental paper, but seemingly preferred by these ancient bullionists. One of the most interesting of the early him into a wide range of rather unrelated pursuits. Thus we find him experimenting with an electrical apparatus sent to the col- lege by Dr. Franklin; corresponding with Winthrop about the comet of 1759 ; writing letters of inquiry to the head of the Jesuits' College in Mexico respecting the discoveries of the Catholic Missions in the North-west: to a Greek bishop in Syria asking for an account of the Gentiles beyond the Caspian, \"with reference to the remains of the ten tribes;\" to Sir William Jones suggesting a search for copies of the Pentateuch among the Black Jews in India. As an antiquarian and Orientalist he was specially famous. He wrote an entertaining but uncritical treatise on King Charles's Judges in Amer- ica. He pursued his Oriental studies with the help of the learned Rabbi Haigim Isaac Carigal, who had charge of the synagogue at Newport. He was active in the contro- versy between the colonies and the mother country, and later in projects for the aboli- tion of the slave trade. He pursued a more liberal policy than President Clap, and it was during his administration that the Hon. James Hillhouse, Treasurer of the College, 584 "},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"originated the conciliatory measure by which, in return for a grant from the State, the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, and six senior Senators were made ex-officio mem- bers of the Corporation. South College, built in 1794, was named Union Hall, to commemorate this union of Church and State in the college government. The successors of Dr. Stiles in the Presi- dency have been Timothy Dwight (1795- 1817); Jeremiah Day (1817-1846)-; Theo- dore Dwight Woolsey (1846-1871); and Noah Porter, the present head of the College. At the time of the Revolution there flour- ished at New Haven a school of Yale poets and patriots, who aided the cause of Inde- pendence with sword and pen—Trumbull, Dwight, Humphreys, and Barlow. They wrote immense epics in rhyme; essays in the style of \"The Spectator;\" satires and epistles after the manner of Pope; epigrams against Tom Paine, Ethan Allen and Thomas Jefferson; and burlesques in imitation of Hudibras. This galaxy of literati, together with three Hartford wits, contributors to \"The American Mercury,\" formed a mutual admiration society and were spoken of as \"The Seven Pleiades of Connecticut.\" Their poems are little read nowadays, but are historically interesting as the beginnings of our national literature, and abundantly filled with the spirit of '76. The two first named, John Trumbull and Timothy Dwight, were chosen tutors in the college in 1771. Their influence served to broaden the course of study by the introduction of the humani- ties,—Trumbull's first satire, \" The Progress of Dullness,\" being directed in part against the dry and unpractical character of the old logical curriculum. Trumbull's best poem was \"M'Fingal,\" a satirical account of the war, which was very popular in its day. Thirty pirated impressions were hawked about by newsmongers and chapmen, and the classical Marquis de Chastellux wrote from Paris complimenting Trumbull in good critical form for having observed all the rules of burlesque poetry obtaining since the age of Homer. Could Dr. Johnson have said more? Two or three couplets of \" M'Fingal\" still circulate as proverbs generally credited to Butler, e. g. : \"No man e'er felt the halter draw With good opinion of the law : \" and, \" But optics sharp it needs, I ween, To see what is not to be seen.\" Trumbull afterward studied law in John Adams's office at Boston, and finally became Judge of the Superior Court of Connecticut. Timothy Dwight is less known to posterity as a writer than as the vigorous scholar who, as President of Yale College, impressed his strong personality upon every one of a gen- eration of students. Yet his contributions to literature were by no means valueless. Prominent among these were his \"Theol- ogy,\" and his entertaining \"Travels in New England and New York,\" of which latter Southey spoke with respect, though he made game of his poems. Of these, \"The Con- quest of Canaan,\" finished at the age of twenty-three, is the longest and most pre- tentious. This is a scriptural epic in rhymed heroics, which was favorably criticised by Cowper in \"The Analytical Review.\" Trum- bull, \"in allusion to the number of thunder- storms described in the portion of the poem handed him to read, requested that, when he sent in the remainder, a lightning-rod might be included.\" Of this epic, with its thunder-storms and Niagaras, its Irads and Selimas, and the rest, one would wish to speak warily as of the manes of the illus- trious dead. Peace be with them! Dwight's best poem is, perhaps, his \" Green- field Hill,\" a rural idyl in the reflective and descriptive vein of Goldsmith. His once famous song, \"Columbia,\" was written during his chaplaincy in the Revolutionary army, and gave voice to the new feeling of Amer- ican nationality. The psalm included in most collections beginning, \"I love Thy kingdom, Lord,\" was written by Dwight. The third star in this constellation was Colonel David Humphreys, who was gradu- ated in 1771. He fought in the Revolution, first as staff officer to General Putnam, and afterward as one of Washington's aids, and was presented with a sword by Congress for gallantry at Yorktown. He continued a life-long friend of Washington, and a fre- quent inmate at Mount Vernon. He was appointed Minister to Spain and introduced into America the breed of Merino sheep. From his woolen factory was furnished the coat in which President Madison took his oath of office. Colonel Humphreys' muse was always patriotic, and, withal, somewhat stately and monotonous. He sung \"The Happiness of America,\" \"The Future Glory of the United States,\" \"Love of Country,\" \"The Death of General Washington,\" and \"The Industry of the United States of America.\" He exchanged poetic epistles with Barlow, \"whom Nature formed her 585"},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":" loftiest poet,\" and with Dwight, \" that bard sublime, the father of our epic song.\" His poem, entitled \" Address to the Armies of the United States of America,\" was trans- lated into French by the Marquis de Chas- tellux. Humphreys was the patron saint and one of the founders of the Brothers in Unity Society, and, as such, his name has come down in college song almost to the present generation of undergraduates. An- other Revolutionary hero, Nathan Hale, the martyr spy, was the founder of the rival society, Linonia. Joel Barlow made his debut as a poet on his Commencement Day, in 1778, by the delivery of a poem on the \" Prospect of Peace.\" Like Dwight, he served as chap- lain in the Revolutionary army. When the war was over, this knot of New Haven poets turned their pens into the service of the Federalist party. Barlow settled at Hartford and wrote for the \"Mercury,\" in connection with Trumbull, Humphreys and Dr. Lemuel Hopkins, a series of papers called \"The Anarchiad,\" in favor of a strong Constitu- tion. But later, he strayed to Paris and went after false gods, becoming a convert to French democracy and taking part in the struggles of the Revolution. He attacked Burke in a pamphlet printed at London, and wrote, among other rather wild things, a famous song in praise of the guillotine to the tune of \" God Save the King.\" He made a fortune abroad by speculation, and, returning to America, after an absence of seventeen years, built a residence near Wash- ington, which he called Kalorama. He was sent as Minister to France by Mr. Monroe, and caught his death by exposure while traveling through Poland to get an inter- view with Napoleon, then engaged on his Russian campaign. Barlow's best poem is \"Hasty Pudding,\" an excellent mock heroic after the manner of Philip's \" Cider.\" The couplet, \" E'en in thy native regions, how I blush To hear the Pennsylvanians call thee mush,\" is familiar, as, indeed, are other passages. But Barlow's chief title to fame in his own time was \" The Columbiad,\" a sort of Fourth of July epic in ten books, splendid with the boom of cannon and the blaze of rockets, with geographical surveys of the continent from \"hills of vision,\" accompanied with remarks by guardian angels and geniuses of America, and ending in a grand holo- caust of ancient errors and superstitions. This was published at Philadelphia in 1807, with prints by the best English engravers, and was the costliest book that had ever been issued from an American press. Many 586 "},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"of the pieces of this early school of Connec- ticut poets were published in a volume of \"American Poems,\" at Litchfield, in 1793. With the opening of the present century, and the accession of President Dwight in 1795, the college entered upon a career of development so rapid and manifold that, from a school attended by scarcely more than one hundred and thirty pupils, and conducted by half a dozen teachers, it has become a university of six separate faculties, numbering some ninety officers of instruc- tion and nearly eleven hundred students, North College, in 1821; the Old Chapel, in 1824, and Old Divinity, in 1835. The build- ings of this row are all standing, except the last, which was pulled down in 1870, to make room for Durfee Hall. The Lyceum is occupied by recitation-rooms. All these buildings are excessively plain, resembling nothing so much as a line of red brick fac- tories. The four dormitories are almost precisely alike. Each is four stories high and has two entries; each entry gives access to sixteen rooms, four on a floor. Though plain in appearance, they furnish comfort- and occupying about thirty buildings, This development has been double: First, an unfolding of the college in itself; Secondly, a throwing off by the parent stem of vigorous shoots in the shape of special' departments and technical schools. The increase in the number of college buildings may first be mentioned, as the outward and visible sign of this progress. The plan of the first builders was as simple as their architecture—mere accretion in a right line. Hence \"the old brick row,\" comprising, besides the structures already mentioned, the Lyceum, begun in 1800; able lodgings. Two of them are heated by steam. All have water on the ground floor, and gas in the entries and in some of the rooms. These buildings are old without being venerable; yet sometimes, in the long sum- mer vacation, when the yard is deserted, their bricky fronts, with the shadows of the elms playing quietly over them, take on a mellow tone of age that appeals to one with a certain pathos for recognition. The rooms in the older colleges have a faint aroma of association. In many, lists of former inmates are kept pasted on the closet doors. The 587 "},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"floors are uneven, the low ceilings are crossed by beams, and there are old-fash- ioned fire-places in the chimney, now chiefly bricked or boarded up. Altogether, it is not strange that so much sentimental opposition 1868 the paintings were removed to the new art school, and the upper floor of Trum- bull Gallery is now taken up by the rooms of the President and Treasurer of the college. On the lower floor are working- was developed among the alumni when, a few years since, it was proposed to move the college from its present site. Behind the main row stand three other buildings irregularly placed—the Laboratory, the Cabinet, and the Trumbull Gallery. The first is a low brick edifice put up in 1782 for a commons hall and kitchen, but used since 1819 for a chemical lecture-room, laboratory, optical chamber, working-rooms, etc. The cabinet is a large building covered with dark stucco, constructed in 1819. The upper story is used as a cabinet of minerals; the lower was occupied by a dining-hall until the abolition of the commons in 1843, but now by recitation-rooms and the \" phil- osophical chamber.\" The Trumbull Gal- lery is a mausoleum-like affair erected in 1832, to hold the paintings presented by Colonel John Trumbull, the historical painter of the Revolution. Some of these pieces are widely known by copies, as, \" The Sign- ing of the Declaration of Independence\" and \"The Death of Montgomery.\" In rooms for entomology, popularly known as the \" Bug Lab.\" The most modern buildings are ranged along the outer edge of the college square, an area of some nine acres, facing inward. They are designed in time to form a con- tinuous quadrangle completely inclosing this square. It is unfortunate that, when this arrangement was decided upon no general plans were drawn for such a quad- rangle. As it is, the new colleges, though in some cases individually creditable, are of so many materials and shapes, that it will be impossible to harmonize them architecturally in a close quadrangle. The first of these is the Library, a graceful Gothic building of rough-dressed Portland sandstone, begun in 1842. Here the books, of the college at last found permanent shelter after lodging succes- sively in the upper stories of the Athensum. the Lyceum, and the Chapel. Including the consolidated libraries of the Linonia and Brothers Societies in the north wing, the college owns one hundred and eleven 588 "},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":" thousand volumes, exclusive of pamph- lets. Alumni Hall, completed in 1853, is a squat, castellated structure of red sandstone,* built in that order of architecture known to readers of \"Cecil Dreeme \" and the Bohemian frequenters of \"Chrysalis\" as mock-Gothic. The lower story is a large hall used for the annual examinations and for Commence- ment meetings of the Alumni. It is hung around with portraits of college benefactors and distinguished graduates. There are two medieval-looking towers (with wooden battlements), whose corkscrew staircases conduct to the two handsome rooms on the upper floor, once the rival debating halls of Linonia and Brothers, but now used as lecture-rooms. By far the most elaborate building on the square is the Art School, completed in 1866 at a cost of $200,000 and upward. It is built of smooth-dressed New Jersey sand- stone, in the shape of an irregular H, and has one entrance, through a tower, from the college side, and another from Chapel street through a fine porch with columns of polished granite. The floors are of oak and black walnut, and the inside finish of the halls and the handsome staircases of. chestnut. The second story contains two large sky-light galleries, in one of which is hung the Jarves collection of paintings illus- trative of the history of Italian art; in the other the Trumbull collection and other paintings be- longing to the college, conspicuous among which is Allston's \" Jere- miah.\" The school also owns a well-chosen gallery of casts, col- lections of photographs, etc. The lower floor is devoted to studios and lecture-rooms. The only portion of the \" quad \" at present closely built, is the north-eastern corner, formed by Farnam, Durfee, and the new chapel. Farnam Hall was finished in 1870. It is built of brick and North River blue-stone, is four stories high, and furnishes accom- modation for 89 students. The rooms are grouped on three stair- cases. Durfee Hall, completed in 1871, is perhaps the most thoroughly satisfactory to the eye of all the college buildings. It is of rough-dressed New * Much, in fact, like the cock's comb in Chaucer: \" ----- redder than the fine coral, Embattailed, as it were, a castle wal.\" Jersey sandstone, four stories high, and accommodates 80 lodgers. The rooms are grouped on five staircases. Both of these houses are heated by steam and lighted by gas throughout, and have water on each floor. Filling the space between Farnam and Durfee is the new chapel, not yet fin- ished, a cruciform building with a rounded apse at the eastern, and two towers at the western end of the nave. Like Durfee, it is of New Jersey sandstone with trimmings of the light-colored Ohio sandstone. Two scutcheons on the Elm street side present the coats of arms of the college and the State, with their respective legends : Lux et Veritas and Qui transtulit sustinet. The chapel will seat 1,150 persons. During the year 1868-9 the question was agitated whether it might' not be well to move the college into the suburbs, on ac- count of the rise in the value of land from the rapid growth of the city. The proposed new site was a lot of fifty acres near the Observatory grounds, on the ridge between East and West Rocks, half a mile north of the Old Hillhouse Place. The plan was given up because of the impossibility of raising money enough to equip the college properly in a fresh location. President Dwight inaugurated the policy of appointing to permanent professorships young men who had given promise as tutors, Among those first appointed were Jeremiah Day, who succeeded Dr. Dwight in the Pres- idency; Benjamin Silliman and James L. Kingsley. A Professorship of Jurisprudence, the nucleus of a Law- School, was founded in 1801; of Chemistry, Mineralogy, and Geol- 589 "},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":" ogyin 18025 of Ancient Languages (Hebrew, Greek and Latin) in 1805; of Rhetoric in 1817. These chairs were afterward divided, and others were added. At present the teaching force of the college proper (or Academical Department) consists of the President, who is also the Professor of Moral Philosophy and Metaphysics; eleven Profes- sors in the following subjects: Natural Philosophy and Astron- omy; Geology and Mineralogy; Latin; Mathematics; Greek; Rhetoric and English Literature; History; Chemistry and Molecu- lar Physics; Modern Languages; German; and Political and Social Science; three Assistant Professors in Mathematics, Latin and English Literature; and ten tutors. The first of the professional schools in operation was the Med- ical School, organized in 1810 with assistance from the State Medical Society, which retains the right of choosing members of the Examining Board. The Faculty consists of seven Professors and a Demonstrator in Anatomy. Since 1859 the School has occupied a three-story brick building on York street, about two blocks from the college, containing a lecture-room, anatom- ical museum, dissecting-rooms, offices, etc. The catalogue of 1875 shows an attendance of forty-two students. In 1822 was organized the Divinity School, developing in time into one of the most pros- perous branches of the University. Instruc- tion is in the hands of six permanent Pro- fessors and several special lecturers. A popular feature was added to the course of study in 1871, by the endowment of the Lyman Beecher Lectureship on Preaching, which has been held in successive years by several eminent divines. Four volumes of \" Yale Lectures on Preaching\" have already issued from the press. The Divinity School is quartered in two fine buildings opposite the new Chapel and Durfee. These are known as East and West Divinity Halls, and were built respectively in 1870 and 1874. They are alike in appearance—each five stories high, and furnish jointly rooms for 150 students. The lower floors are devoted to class-rooms, libraries, etc. Con- nected with East Divinity is the small but elegant Marquand Chapel. The number of students at the Seminary averages 100. The Law School was started in 1824 and celebrated its semi-centennial in 1874; on which occasion Chief-Justice Waite pre- sided. The Hon. Edwards Pierrepont de- livered an oration and ex-President Woolsey an historical address. The School has been located since 1873 in fine apartments, occu- pying the entire third floor of the new County Court House. Its efficiency has increased greatly within the last decade, and the number of its students has been nearly trebled. On the last catalogue it stood 76 The Law School has four regular Profes- sors and seven or eight lecturers. The most powerful department of the Uni- versity, after the Academical, is the Sheffield Scientific School. Although this has had many benefactors, and although its success has been due in great part to the exceptional energy and ability of its Professors, yet it may be regarded as mainly the work of one man, Mr. Joseph E. Sheffield, of New Haven. The School was started in 1847, but led a struggling existence till 1860, when Mr. Sheffield bought the old Medical College at the head of College street and presented it to the School, after having refitted it, added two wings, and furnished it with apparatus. The building has received later additions; among others, two towers for astronomical purposes. It is known as Sheffield Hall. In 1873 the same generous patron built and equipped a second building, North Sheffield Hall, immediately north of the former. Both are occupied by laboratories, collections, drawing rooms, observatories, libraries, lec- ture and recitation rooms and private rooms for instructors. The large lecture-room in North Sheffield seats 400. The known gifts 590 "},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":" of Mr. Sheffield to the School exceed $350,000. But he has given much pri- vately in addition. The Faculty of the Sheffield School con- sists of sixteen Professors, and thirteen instructors and assistants. The number of undergraduates is 224. Although the sphere of the school is primarily the Natural Sci- ences, it is by no means a mere professional or technical institute. It secures a liberal basis for special study by enforcing, in Fresh- man year, a uniform course in mathematics, physics, chemistry, botany, physical geog- raphy, drawing, German, English and polit- ical economy. Some knowledge of Latin is required for admission. There is a \" select course,\" embracing linguistics, political econ- omy, and history (under such instructors as Professor William D. Whitney and General Francis A. Walker), English language and literature, German, French, and English composition. The Scientific School has, indeed, attained the dimensions of a second and independent college. It is not unlikely that, by an enlargement of its courses in language and history (adding perhaps the classical tongues), the Academic Department in the meanwhile gradually opening elective courses, and increasing its facilities for the teaching of natural science, the two may eventually come to cover nearly the same ground. Here may be mentioned the Peabody Museum of Natural History, endowed by Mr. George Peabody of London. This is a handsome four-story building, just erected on the corner of Elm and High streets, opposite Alumni Hall. It contains lecture- rooms, offices, and cabinets for collections in zoology, geology, mineralogy, paleontology, and American archeology. The valuable collections of fossils made by the annual Yale expedition in the West, under the lead- ership of Professor Marsh, will be arranged in the Peabody Museum. The building already erected is merely one wing of a larger structure which will stretch from Elm to Library street. The Yale School of the Fine Arts is, like the Sheffield School, mainly the creation of a single donor, Mr. Augustus R. Street of New Haven, whose gifts to the college have amounted to $280,000, besides other sums of unknown amount not yet realized. The Faculty of the Art School consists of a Professor of Painting and Design, a Professor of the History of Art, a Professor of Drawing, and an Instructor in Per- spective. It has some thirty stu- dents, and is open to both sexes. These various departments, though subject to the general government of the University,—the original President and Fellows of Yale College,—are practically independent in their internal discipline and instruction. The President of the college is ex officio President of each of the schools; but these have also a Dean, Chairman, or Director, who acts as executive officer of his department. All degrees, of course, are con- ferred by the University. One of the most encouraging symptoms in the recent development of the University is the establishment of a school for the advanced instruction of graduate students. At present, however, this department has no separate organization, instruction being given by members of the undergraduate Faculties in the intervals of their other work. The annual report by the Executive Committee of the Society of the Alumni, published June 1 st, 1875, says : \"There have been this year 29 [graduate] students distributed in the following classes : In History, 13 ; in Polit- ical Science, 12; in Sanskrit and General Philology, 9; in English Literature, 7; in Greek, 7 ; in Hebrew, 6; in Mental Science, 4 ; in Mathematics, 3 ; in Latin, 2; in Gothic, 2.\" This is exclusive of graduate students in Natural Sciences. The number of gradu- ate students now in attendance is 63. The recent establishment of several Fellowships will do much toward stimulating graduate study; but what is most needed is provision 591 "},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"for a number of University Professors who should devote themselves exclusively to this department. It would be impossible, within the limits of this paper, to mention the many gifts, in the shape of endowment funds, building funds, scholarships, books, money, specimens, apparatus, etc., which have contributed to the rapid advance thus briefly sketched in all departments of the University. It is worthy of note, however, that Yale owes nearly all that she has to private liberality. The gifts of the commonwealth of Connecti- cut to the college do not, all told, exceed $100,000, if we except $135,000, the product of the sale of public lands granted to the Scientific School as the State Agricultural Institute. The productive property of the University, according to the last Treasury Exhibit, is about $1,500,000. If to this be added the value of the land, and the amount that has been spent in buildings, books, apparatus, etc., the University may be roughly estimated as worth five millions of dollars—a small sum, if we consider what has been accomplished with it. Indeed, the history of the college is a story of unceasing struggle with poverty—almost with bank- ruptcy; of self-denying effort by its officers, and of a system of small and patient econo- mies on the part of its financial managers. In addition to the buildings belonging to the separate departments ought perhaps to be mentioned the College Gymnasium, and the building opposite it on Library street, occupied by graduate students ; the elegant new boat-house of the Yale Navy on Mill River, and the halls of the Skull and Bones, Scroll and Keys, Psi Upsilon, and Delta Kappa Epsilon Societies. About the years 1869-71 appeared what was called \"the Young Yale movement,\" a rather vaguely expressed, though clearly shown, dissatisfaction among the younger graduates with the conservatism of the col- lege government. It was urged especially that there was too large a clerical element in the corporation, and that the Alumni ought to be represented. There was much controversy in and out of print, Dr. Leonard Bacon taking a prominent part on the Old Yale, and Mr. William Walter Phelps on the Young Yale, side. Finally, in accordance with a suggestion of President Woolsey, made as long ago as 1866, the State agreed to relinquish a share of its claim in the gov- ernment of the college, and the six Senior Senators were replaced by an equal number of gentlemen, chosen, one each year, by the Alumni at their annual Commencement meetings. In speaking of the influence which the college has had on the intellectual develop- ment of the country, a comparison naturally suggests itself between Yale and the sister University at Cambridge. Founded under similar auspices, and for similar purposes, the two have diverged widely in spirit- Cambridge, with the neighboring city of Boston, is widely known, not only as the seat of Harvard College, but as trie center of most that is best in American letters. New Haven can claim no such distinction. There has always been in the training given at Yale a certain severity. Discipline, rather than culture; power, rather than grace; 592"},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":" \"light,\" rather than \"sweetness,\" have been, if not the aim, at least the result of her teach- ings. Her scholars have been noted for solid and exact learning. Perhaps Dwight and Woolsey on one hand, and Everett and Felton on the other, may be taken as the types of Yale and Harvard Presidents. This difference is owing to many causes. Har- vard has had at her back a wealthy and cultivated city. Boston is the chief point on this continent where the electric sparks have been taken off from the current of European thought. Yale, on the contrary, has been situated in a small provincial city, with little \" atmosphere \" beyond what the college itself might impart to the town. Again, the Unitarian and Transcendental movements in Massachusetts during the first half of this century, whatever may have been their effect on the Church, undoubtedly stim- ulated literary activity. The course of study at the two colleges has been much the same. The influences of place have differed toto ccelo. The imag- ination and the feelings may be chastened, but they cannot be aroused to original expression by any scheme of study. For this there are needed fresh and joyous impressions from without; a free and even audacious reception and interchange of new thought. These impulses the Massachusetts come-outers of the last generation had and profited by. Before the recent changes in its system, Harvard was not very a large and by no means popular college, drawing most of its students from Eastern Massachusetts. Its Alumni settled largely in Boston and neigh- Yale the reverse has been true. She has not kept her boys at home. They came from all over the country, largely from New York and the West, and, before the war, from the South; and after graduation they cut loose from Alma Mater's apron-strings, and were scattered more widely than before. This, which has been her weakness, has also been her strength. She has a national character, and her investments are everywhere. Yale is by no means deficient in distinguished names in poetry, fiction, criticism, and belles-lettres generally, numbering among her graduates of the present century Pierpont, Hillhouse, Cooper,* Per- cival, Willis, Bushnell, Judd (the author of \" Margaret,\") Bristed, Mitchell, Winthrop, and Stedman, with others perhaps less famous. But the centrifugal force of New Haven is shown in the fact that of this list only three have resided there since their graduation, and these at different times. There has never been a Yale school of writers since the * Non-graduate, class of 1806. 593 boring towns, and there thus grew up about the college a cultivated body of its sons, and in time a school of brilliant writers.

In scholarship she is represented by such names as Webster, Worcester, Woolsey, Hadley, and Whitney; in science and invention by Silliman, Morse, Whitney, Dana, and Chau- venet; in divinity by Edwards, Hopkins, Emmons, Dwight, and Taylor; in the State and at the bar by Grimke, Mason, Kent, Calhoun, and Evarts.

Presidents Barnard of Columbia, White of Cornell, Gilman of the Hopkins University, and Chancellor Stille of the University of Pennsylvania, are all graduates of Yale. This paper has been devoted mainly to tracing the growth of the university as an educational institution. The social life of the undergraduates falls outside our com- pass. Much might be written of the old col- men now in public life the names of the Hon. William M. Evarts, Chief-Justice Waite, Attorney-General Pierrepont, and Governor Samuel J. Tilden. Yale is, in a sense, the daughter of Har- vard. Her founders and early Presidents and tutors were of necessity Harvard men. But the younger college has since been far more active in founding and officering new colleges—a work, be it said, which has proved to be of doubtful expediency. Yale may be called, like Virginia, \"Mother of lege commons, of the Bully Club, of Town and Gown fights, of Linonia and Brothers and the Secret Societies; of the ceremonies of Presentation Day; of college journalism and college boating, and of many other cus- toms, traditions, and institutions, but they would easily fill a chapter by themselves. Probably at no other American college has so distinctive a social life been developed as at Yale, nor one so rich in humorous and picturesque traits. This life has never been adequately described.

She comes—had come, unknown, before— Though not on 'vext Bermoothes' shore; Yet will she not her prophet fail— The Old—the New—the same dear Yale.\" The article below is from Life magazine April 3,191 3. This is not the same Life magazine begun in 1936 by Bonesman Henry Luce. This was one of the last articles about The Order o f Skull and Bones in the popular press until Esquir e magazine in September 1977 WE read in the papers that the Yale worm has turned and that the whole Sophomore class, except two members, have signed in a book not to be joined to Bones, Keys or Wolf's Head Senior Societies, as now consti- tuted. The said organizations, it seems, must abolish secrecy and get in a new line of consecration, if they are to enjoy the patronage of the pres- ent Yale Sophomore class. This is great news. Who would be free themselves must strike the blow. It is much more suit- able for the Yale Sophomores to take this action than for the faculty to do it, because a Sophomore can better afford to be foolish than a faculty can. If the little Senior clubs at Yale can be broken of some of their silly habits, and shorn of their importance as arbiters of destinies and standard- izes of character, there is no reason why they should not renew their health and live joyful and comparatively in- nocuous ever after. For the last forty years they have been getting more and more out of date and more and more in the way of what Dr. Wilson calls \"The New Freedom.\" Surely they must know it, and must be glad of a chance to rid themselves of buncombe and an uncomfortable prestige, and shake down into something that will fit into a modern institution. It is not the fault of their members that they have come to be a nuisance. That is something that has just hap- pened to them, in the march of events, just as it has happened to the trusts and the tariff and the House of Lords. And the revolt of the Sophomores is just a piece of the contemporary unheaval. Everybody who cares for Yale is to be congratulated on it, especially Bones, Keys and Wolf's Head. Now these amusing organiza- tions will be able to modernize them- selves, let daylight into their club houses, exhibit the enlightened selfish- ness which is all that is possible to any club that lives by exclusion and permit themselves some of the exercises of hospitality, from which hitherto they have been debarred. It is obvious that something happen between their sophomore and senior years, because the societies l ived on with their secrets intact - and still act se cretly today. 595 "},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":" 596"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"THE SKELETON CREW KRIS MILLEGAN ______________________________________ ______ J ULY 2003 HIS LIST IS COMPILED from material from the Order o f Skull and Bones membership books at Sterling Library, Yale Universi ty and other public records.

But some observers see the future of societies in the flexibility of the under- ground system—and especially in the unique feature of Vaya or Vale. \"At Yale,\" Professor Argyris says, \"the co-ed societies undergo the same kind of experience as the all-male ones. In my view, in fact, they have a richer experience.\" He concludes that if Yale should go co-ed (in about five years' time) \"this will not undermine the society impulse per se; but there will cer- tainly be greater pressure to co-educate the societies.\" A senior, currently in one of the co-ed societies, says; \"It's fantastic, and you can forget about all that 'missed prestige'. You can get as intimate as you want with your roommates, if that's what you want to do. But talking in that way to girls, and getting to understand what a different thing the female mind is, that's another dimension altogether. Amazing, that's all.\" Mr. Reisman would probably agree, He sees \"a certain insulation at Yale from which some students are now breaking out.\" And, he adds, \"I hope the place goes co-ed.\" And so, the argument rages on. There are those who insist that there will always be a need for an all-male society, no matter how much Yale changes. The possi- bility that Skull and Bones will co-educate in the near future is not strong. And others feel that the question of co-education apart, societies will have to change and adjust to the new spirit of skepticism. [cropped from page bottom — ed.] They probably will. Skull and Bones had to change a century of tradition in its tapping procedure merely to remain alive: pre-tapping has now become so prevalent that it is apparent that few \"big men\" would now turn down a sure election for the possibility of a Bones tap.

S outhern Pacific Railroad Company, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that a private corporation is a person and entitled to the legal rights and protections the Co nstitutions affords to any person. Because the Constitution mak es no mention of corporations, it is a fairly clear case of the Court's taking it upon itself to rewrite the Consti tution. Far more remarkable, however, is that the doctrine of corporate personhood, which subsequently became a cornerstone of corporate law, was introduced into t his 1886 decision without argument. According to th e official case record, Supreme Court Justice Morrison Remick Waite simply pronounced before the beginning of arg ument in the case of Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacif ic Railroad Company that The court does not wish to hear argument on the que stion whether the provision in the Fourteenth Amend ment to the Constitution, which forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of opinion that i t does. The court reporter duly entered into the summary re cord of the Court's findings that The defendant Corporations are persons within the i ntent of the clause in section 1 of the Fourteen Am endment to the Constitution of the United States, which forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Thus it was that a two-sentence assertion by a sing le judge elevated corporations to the status of per sons under the law, prepared the way for the rise of global corpor ate rule, and thereby changed the course of history . The doctrine of corporate personhood creates an int eresting legal contradiction. The corporation is ow ned by its shareholders and is therefore their property. If it is also a legal person, then it is a person owned by others and thus exists in a condition of slavery — a status explici tly forbidden by the Thirteenth Amendment to the Co nstitution. So is a corporation a person illegally held in serv itude by its shareholders? Or is it a person who en joys the rights of personhood that take precedence over the presume d ownership rights of its shareholders? So far as I have been able to determine, this contradiction has not been directly addressed by the courts. from David Korten's The Post-Corporate World, Life After Capitalism F LESHING O UT S KULL & B ONES - I NVESTIGATIONS INTO A MERICA ' S M OST P OWERFUL S ECRET S OCIETY"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"RTA, I NCORPORATED — A S HELL G AME KRIS MILLEGAN________________________________ JULY 2003 HE OFFICIAL NAME FOR THE ORDER OF SKULL AND BONES i s RTA, Incorporated. Daniel Coit Gilman first incorpo rated the Order of Skull & Bones in 1856 as the Russell Trust Association. The name was changed in 1961 to RTA, Incorporated. In November 1983, the members voted positively on a n Amending Certificate. The proper papers filed in December increased the B oard of Directors from six to eight members and the President was given more powe r among other changes. Whether this was at all in reaction to the release of Antony Sutton's first Bones book, An Introduction to the Order, isn't known. Wh at is interesting about the amendment is the voting record presented. There is just enough information in the documents, to satisfy the legal filing requi rements, so one cannot form a definite answer about all of the group's rules for voting, but it is interesting that they list as the members required for a quorum as 3 5 with 71 as being \"Present in Person or by Proxy and Entitled to vote.\" The vote required for adoption is stated as 48. Now that is the two-thirds of 71 and in RTA' s Certificate of Incorporation of 1961, Section 8 (Which the amendment of 1983 neg ates.) it states that \"any action may be taken only after a two-thirds majorit y vote of members.\" But then it goes on to state, \"the vote of majority of the v oting power of members shall be sufficient.\" This suggests that if 15 get togeth er eight votes wins. So who all gets to vote and what does it take to ge t things done in the organi- zation? In section 5 it states, \"[t]he Corporation shall have members, all of whom shall be of the same class.

But we do find it interesting that an amendment change was accomplished by such small numbers. In the Sept ember 27, 1991, the New Haven Register reported \"almost 700 of the club's a pproximately 800 surviving members narrowly voted to admit women.\" S HOULD T HE O RDER GET A T AX F REE R IDE ON IT ' S F OUR M ILLION D OLLAR N EST E GG ?______________________ he question of their taxes is also very interesting . RTA Incorporated tax statements are available online at www.guidestar.co m and at www.fleshing outskullandbones.com. If you can look at these docu ments, you will find the tax forms are quite revealing in what they say ... and do not say. There are required questions, boxes, and blanks to fill in that they j ust leave empty or write \"not available.\" The most blatant and egregious action i s their use of the tax code to pay no taxes on their investment earnings of someti mes over $400,000 a year and that members may take their donations to Bones as deductions off of their personal income tax liabilities. RTA Incorporated is a non-profit 501 (c) 3 corporat ion carrying no tax burden at all. It does all this, while spending yearly $4, 000 to $10,000 renting their private island for \"[r]ental of facility for educat ional programs,\" and $50,000 a year on \"[conferences, conventions, and meetings, \" plus another $40,000 to $60,0000 thousand a year in occupancy expenses. The Order has also been spending money on renovations and improvements, spe nding over a quarter of a million dollars in 1998. Did they add a women's l ocker room to their fabled underground swimming pool or just fancy his and her s coffins? The only charitable donations listed in their tax r eturns are in the years 1999 and 2000. A $5,000 donation, each of those years, t o the Yale Scholarship Fund. The majority of all the expenses are declared in th e tax form's Program Service Expenses column as \"Educational Programs.\" There is no discussion of achieve- ments, no number of clients served, nothing but \"Ed ucational Programs.\" The Order of Skull & Bones skirts both the spirit and l etter of the law by claiming to be an educational support organization for Yale Uni versity. The 1961 Certificate of Incorporation papers give some window dressing a nd cover some of the 501 (c)3 requirements but the activities of the group do not seem to be educational but fraternal and secret. How can a secret society, whi ch does not divulge its purpose, history or even its members be considered an educat ional non-profit?

A lawyer fr iend of mine said that the Order's tax returns, are, \"skillfully prepared to l ook bland and innocuous.\" At least from the listing of the officers and board me mbers gathered from the RTA Incorporated state corporate and federal tax record s have allowed us to at least fill in some of the holes in the membership lists \" dark\" years. There is no publicly held listing of members after 1972 or privately proffered list of \"Bonespersons\" after 1985. The only semi-co nfirmed list after that is 2000 when the Rumpus, at Yale printed a copy of the Bone s printed materials. We cannot be 100% about it though, considering Rumpus's known irrelevancies and tabloid predilections. We have not seen the original and wi th today's digital methods, one could be created. Over fifteen years of members are unknown. What influence these 20 and 30-somethings are having on our curren t affairs is unknown. Another item gleaned from the tax returns is that c ontributions have gone from $164,000 in 1997 to $45,00 in 2000. Whether th e drop in contributions is part of some dissension or just a reflection of the economy is as are many things about the Order ... in the dark.
