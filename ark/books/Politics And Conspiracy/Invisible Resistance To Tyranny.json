CHAPTER 1 A TERRORIST wm-UP CALL TO WAR Declaration of Independence Second Continental Congress July 4, 1776 They came out of a morning sky, American commercial air- craft piloted by religious fanatics who had hijacked four planes loaded with innocent passengers. Within hours almost 5,000 American men, women, and children were suddenly dead, mur- dered in a vicious act of terrorism that wrenched us all into a new kind of war. It is a war in which every individual American sud- denly finds him- or herself on the front lines, the possible target for the next act of terror the enemy chooses to launch. We have no way of knowing how long this fight will contin- ue, how many more acts of terrorism we will suffer, or what sac- rifice we will have to make to defeat our enemy. What we do know is that we will prevail. We will not win because of our great wealth, scientific know- how, or sophisticated military machinery. We will certainly not win because of our political leaders' courage, strength, intelli-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"prise attack. The attack on the United States on September 11,200 1, was a pure act of terror. True Freedom Fighters Don't Kill the Innocent A terrorist will commit acts of extreme violence in an attempt to force an enemy to act in the way he desires. The the- ory behind acts of terror is that ordinary people, frightened by the terror, will force their government to give in to the political demands of the people committing the terrorism. Acts of terror- ism are always committed by unpopular political groups who can't achieve their goals through peaceful means or military action. Unable to win by diplomacy or waging war, they turn to acts of terrorism, hoping to further their cause by making the whole world their enemy. The problem is, it doesn't work. It almost always has the opposite effect. It scares the civilian populations to the point where they will applaud any action their government takes to counter the terrorism, even if it means almost total loss of their own personal freedom. We've have seen how miserably the theory of terrorism failed on September 11,2001. Never, since the attack on Pearl Harbor 60 years before, have we seen Americans and their political lead- ers so united in a single common cause. We have seen how mis- erably it failed after the bombing of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City, when the federal government enjoyed wide- ranging approval to further curtail the rights of Americans who had nothing to do with that crime. People who love and fight for freedom do not commit acts of terror, ever! Anyone who truly believes in freedom can never condone or participate in any act of terror. A freedom fighter, whether operating as part of an army or alone and in secret, will only consider committing acts of violence as a last-resort mea- sure, when the situation has deteriorated to the point where civilians are being killed by a government out of control. Those fighting for freedom want only to convince govern- ments to leave them alone to enjoy freedom. When terrorists rehse to leave free people alone, freedom fighters respond with acts of war, not terror. The brave civilians on United Flight 93 committed the first act of war in response to the terrorism of September 11, 2001. Those heroes pointed the way, showing how each one of us, acting as a free individual, can help wage the war on terrorists, just as free individuals can wage war against tyrants. Individual Resistance to Terrorism and 'Qranny Starts with One Free Human Being Every freedom-loving individual has a role to play in the fight against tyranny and terrorism. Acts of invisible resistance to both tyranny and terrorism occur when individuals-acting without direction or guidance from any leader-resist, obstruct, frustrate, expose, and interfere with tyrants and terrorists and those who actively support or execute the orders of tyrants and terrorists. Individuals involved in invisible resistance act alone or in cooperation with a few trusted friends or others who also face the same immediate risks. They pick their own targets or, in the case of terrorism, their targets pick them. They choose their own form of action depending upon the opportunities available and individual abilities and limitations. Individual Resistance to Terrorism- the Easy Part of the Equation Individual resistance to terrorism requires the same mindset that we use when defending ourselves against criminal attack. Smart ordinary citizens don't go looking for criminals to attack; indeed, they do everything within reason to avoid any contact with criminals. We avoid dark streets and other places where criminals are likely to lurk. We put locks on our doors, keep a watch on those around us, especially when dealing with strangers, and we arm and prepare ourselves to handle criminal"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"attack should it occur. When criminals do attack, brave men and women fight back. We also cooperate with police authorities when we have information on criminal activities. Those of us who want to do our part to resist terrorism will go about our daily lives and hope that we never actually have to deal with a terrorist. At the same time, we will be alert to the fict that they are out there, that they are planning more attacks, and that any one of us might suddenly find him- or herself in a situa- tion in which how one reacts may not only mean the difference between one's own life and death but the lives of thousands of our fellow citizens. Invisible resistance to terrorism consists of three basic rules of action: 1. Do every thing possible to ensure you do not become a vic- tim of a terrorist. 2. If, despite those efforts, you find yourself involved in a ter- rorist action or engaged with anyone you suspect intends to commit an act of terror, be prepared to do everything possi- ble to frustrate the will of the terrorist, including the use of deadly resistance. 3. Demand that our political leaders give full attention to ful- filling their oath of office to defend our cou~ltry against such acts in ways consistent with the U.S. Constitution. The terrorists who carried out the attacks on September 11, 2001, were living among us. While the pundits have talked about possible failures by our government in identifjring them beforehand, there must have been many situations in which a single, alert citizen could have frustrated their plans. It might have been an airport security guard, an alert airline agent, a sus- picious neighbor, a hotel clerk, or even a waitress or taxi driver. We have to admit that none of us suspected that such things would ever happen. Now we are warned. Therefore, every one of us must go about our daily lives aware that someone we meet along the way may be planning to commit an act of terror. We are already seeing evidence that Americans are intent on resisting ter- rorism. Crop duster pilots are taking key parts of their planes home at night. People on fishing trips are watching who might be dumping what in a reservoir. Citizens across the country are buy- ing gas masks, water filters, medicines, and firearms. Many are changing travel plans by driving a car instead of flying so that they can always go armed, ready to resist with deadly force if necessary. Our political leaders are also reacting. They know that we will hold them to their promises to find and punish those responsible as well as those who harbor and support them. We have made it clear that should they fBil to do so, we will take our revenge on them at election time. We will endure and we will defeat the campaign of terror that has been launched against us. But when that job is done, we will still have the problem of the drift of our country into democra- tic mob tyranny. Individual Resistance to Tyrann~ the DifSicult Part of the Equation Once we have identified, punished, or neutralized those responsible for the events of September 11, we will have a much more difficult problem to deal with-the problem of what has happened to freedom in our own country. The part that any ordinary citizen will play in the fight against terrorism depends on luck of the draw, with most of us having little or no oppor- tunity to act at all except to live our lives without fear, but every one of us can take action against democratic mob tyranny. Prior to September 11,2001, those willing to fight for free- dom had concluded that the greatest danger to our freedom was the drift into democratic mob tyranny deliberately manipulated by our own political leaders. We rightly understood that the ene- mies we must fear most are not the ones on a foreign shore but the enemies of freedom inside our own borders. Now, even when we are under attack from a foreign source,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"while we unite with our leaders and our fellow citizens so we can fight a vicious foreign aggression, we must still keep the above truth in mind. When we have defeated the foreign enemy, we will still have to resist the enemies of fieedom in our own nation. We have already seen politicians and bureaucrats demanding that we give up more of our rights to privacy, communication, and even speech as part of the cost of winning the war against terrorism. A whole new enforcement apparatus in government called the \"Office of Homeland Security\" has been created. As they always do in a time of crisis, our politicians are asking us to trade freedom for tyranny. Those of us who demand freedom know too well how such ideas, which sound good when first proposed, will still be in place long after the crisis has passed and will be used to the detri- ment of freedom. As an example of how that happens, we only have to look at the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) laws, which were originally developed to combat organized crime but are now used against Americans ranging from antiabortion and environmental activists to doctors who arrange for private payment for their services. At the same time, politicians are brushing aside suggestions that we return to the well-proven solution to defeating both criminals and terror- ists-the armed citizen. Terrorism will not be defeated by limiting freedom. Indeed, the limitations on our fieedom to bear arms directly contributed to the ease with which the terrorism of September 11 was com- mitted. The sad fact of history is that in every war our nation has fought, there have been government officials who saw the con- flict as an opportunity to limit the freedom of American citizens in order to ensure their own positions and perks of power. What Our Government Was Su~~osed to Be Those who wrote the Constitution of the United States expected that document to strictly limit the government in what it could do with the power the people bestowed on it. The Constitution set up a limited government as an association of equal and fiee citizens. Each citizen was guaranteed freedom to do anything he' chose so long as he didn't use force against another citizen except in self-defense. While laws could be enact- ed by majority vote of elected representatives, the majority could not pass any law to take advantage of any minority or deny any individual any basic human right, as set forth in the Bill of Rights. The Constitution was supposed to limit what elected leaders could do so that it wouldn't matter much who held office. Politicians would not be very important people except in time of war. Elected officials would not win elections by pitting one group of citizens against another. Leaders would not be people who would tell any lie, promise anything to anyone, and spend as much money getting elected as they could collect from the fools who believed their promises. Those who formed our federal and state governments knew that the citizens of the new country would have to be constantly alert to protect their freedoms. Every single day, politicians, authoritarians, the lazy, the weak, and the easily frightened would be maneuvering to find ways to change such a fiee society into something less fiee. As Benjamin Franklin told a women after the Constitution was drafted, we had a Republic . . . ifwe could keep it. How Things Went Wrong American politicians quickly discovered that they could keep themselves in office and expand their personal power by playing one group of voters against another. They eventually sold the idea that the majority of voters had the right to decide what everyone else will do, even if big chunks of the minority didn't want to give up their afternoon drinks, their target pistols, their snowmobiles, their gas-guzzling SUVs, or their right to spend all the money they earned in the way they wanted. Elected officials learned that the majority was all too willing"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"to tax an economically successfil minority for its own advantage. The United States, led by self-seeking politicians and a profes- sional cadre of bureaucratic parasites, began the drift that has been twisting our country into a new form of tyranny-democ- ratic mob tyranny. As politicians granted more and more privi- leges to different groups while playing them off against each other, we found ourselves increasingly less in control of our own lives until we found ourselves in the situation we are in today- weighed down by a crushing burden of taxes, laws, and regula- tions everywhere we turn. The Cultural Disease of Supreme Government The American political system can be compared with a patient suffering from a parasitic disease. The carriers of the dis- ease are elected politicians, those who hope to replace them, and those who expect to gain personal advantage from a supreme central government. Each of the three factions hopes to control the power of government force by convincing voters to depend on the politicians instead of their own efforts, hard work, and creativity. Each individual who learns to depend on government ceases to be a productive citizen and begins living off the plun- der stolen from the productive citizens through taxes. As the dis- ease spreads through the body politic, the productive class dwin- dles while the parasites multiply. Decreasing numbers of produc- ers must pay larger percentages of their income to support the ever-growing parasitic class (and I am not only referring to peo- ple on welfare rolls-corporations and rich executives benefit hugely from government subsidies and favors). If the spread of the disease is not halted, the entire system must eventually collapse. Before that happens, government offi- cials must place greater limits on the freedoms of the productive citizens in order to force them to keep producing the wealth that the entire system depends on. Eventually this must lead to total tyranny as political leaders attempt to forestall the inevitable col- lapse and death of the system. While increasing the misery, the tyranny mill only postpone the collapse but not prevent it from eventually happening. The truth is that too many Americans don't see a problem with any of this. They don't give a damn whether they are free or not but only whether they are safe or not. They only care about how much more they can get from the government than what they have to pay in as taxes. They welcome democratic mob tyranny because they are a part of the mob, believing that the system will make them safe, comfortable, happy, and free from all fears. The Achilles Heel of Democratic Mob eranny Throughout history, tyrants gained power through force of arms. They conquered people, subdued and enslaved them, then ruled them for life. The death of the tyrant didn't end the mis- ery but only passed the leadership on to his heir. The only way the tyranny could end was in its conquest by another power or by violent revolution. It does no good to murder those close to a tyrant. Nor does it do any good to murder thousands of his subjects in hopes of forcing him to give up power. A totalitarian ruler can easily suffer the death of hundreds of thousands of his subjects and the abject misery of all the rest as long as enough of them remain alive to produce the wealth required to support his lifestyle and purchase the allegiance of his personal guards and military forces. We only have to look at the historical example of Nazi Germany, where no one could surrender until Adolf Hitler chose death rather than capture by the Soviet army. A more recent example is Saddam Hussein, who still holds power in Iraq despite the terrible loss of life in two great wars and the growing misery of his people caused by the United Nations' embargo undertaken in the hopes of fomenting revolt inside Iraq."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Democratic mob tyranny-in which elected politicians rule for only as long as they can convince the majority of the voting population to keep them in office-presents a different situation than the traditional totalitarian forms. With mob democracy, politicians must worry about the safety and contentment of the population because they need their votes to stay in power. This makes the system much more fragile than the old-fashioned one- man-rule tyrannies. Once enough people in the mob lose faith in the ability of elected officials to live up to their promises, their hold on power can collapse at any moment. If the officials can't correct the situation that caused the loss of faith with better pro- paganda or more payoffs, they almost certainly will lose the next election, if they last even that long. As long as the mob of voters is behind him, the democratic tyrant has an almost unbreakable hold on his power. We can see how this has played out in the cases of two U.S. presidents: Dick Nixon and Willy Jeff Clinton. Nixon, largely because of protests over the Vietnam War, had lost the support of the majority of American voters. As a result, his conviction for abuse of power during the Watergate affair was such a sure thing that he didn't bother to stick around for a House vote on impeachment, let alone a Senate trial. Clinton, on the other hand, had the support of the majority of the voters despite clear evidence that he was guilty of the charges in the House articles of impeachment. Too many Americans continued to believe the lies Wily Jeff was pitching about welfire programs, free health care, and new government jobs for those too lazy or incompetent to find jobs in the free enterprise system. Therefore, due to political pressure from the mob, the Senate buckled and voted against an impeachment trial. Mobs can change directions, and sometimes they do sud- denly and unexpectedly. When large numbers of citizens lose their fiith in the politicians who rule them, they can get so angry that they take to the streets. When that happens, the tyrants who have been leading the mob can suddenly find themselves in seri- ous trouble and soon out of a job and on the run. We saw this occur in the Philippines when mobs poured into the streets demanding an end to the corrupt Marcos regime. In the past 30 years, it also happened in Thailand, South Korea, Chile, Argentina, and Iran. More recently, much to the surprise of our wonderful wiz- ards of foreign affairs in Washington, it suddenly started hap- pening throughout the communist world. In the Soviet Union, East Germany, Poland, Romania, Albania, Estonia, and in every other communist country except three: mobs of citizens lost their faith in the promises of their tyrannical leaders and took to the streets to demand a new world without the old bankrupt, corrupt system. It even almost happened in Red China until the fledgling freedom movement was crushed in Tiananmen Square in 1989. There was little or no armed revolution in most of the coun- tries where such spontaneous revolts occurred. All that hap- pened was that the mob that had once cheered the tyrants real- ized that their promises would never be fulfilled and that things were going to keep deteriorating for as long as those politicians held power. People without arms or leaders moved into the streets in massive numbers to demand their freedom, and free- dom is what they got. What We Can Do to Make That Happen Here So you live in this great country but you don't like the high taxes, the heavy-handed regulation of your business, the govern- ment welfare system (both individual and corporate), what pub- lic schools are doing to your children, the drinking laws of your state, the war on drugs, or the daily hassle of government intrud- ing in your life whenever you turn around.

Should you start killing IRS agents or blowing up govern-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"INVISIBLE RESISTANCE TO TYRANNY ment buildings in the name of freedom? Of course not! This book isn't written for psychos who wrap themselves in the rhetoric of freedom to justify the murder of innocents. This book is written for the ordinary guy or gal who wants to take back control of his or her own life and who is willing to take some risks to do it. We still have a few things going in our favor. We have free elections, and there is relative freedom of the press, freedom to assemble, freedom of religion, freedom to petition the govern- ment, and the right to trial by jury with legal counsel. Just about anybody can start a political movement to try to get freedom back without worrying too much about government reprisals. A politician may sic the IItS dogs on you, but you don't have to worry about being hauled off to a concentration camp or face a summary firing squad (at least not yet). And there's another major point that for now appears to be working in our favor. Politicians have to have the enormous wealth a free economy produces in order to steal enough in taxes to pay off the promises they make to get elected. This gives us a timeframe in which we can use nonviolent means for dealing with our politicians in ways that will limit their ability to control us through force and fraud. If we do not take advantage of this time to win freedom back with nonviolent means, our only choice will eventually be a bloody fight for freedom or total submission to democratic mob tyranny. Instead, we have to find ways to destroy faith in supreme government. We have to convince our friends, co-work- ers, and neighbors that supreme government is a bad deal, that money lost to taxes is money spent on parasites, and that much of the misery people suffer in this country is the direct result of government action. We have to encourage those who currently love their tyrants to see the incredible amount of abuse, waste, and fraud that takes place in the name of government and to get as mad as we are. Don't Try to Get Your Freedom Back by Organizing I know that sounds strange and goes against everything you have ever been told about the importance of organizing, the need to play on a winning team, and how there is strength in \\ numbers. The problem is that the first thing that any organiza- tion has to have is leaders, and that is what no free individual wants to have. Leaders give orders and commands that must be obeyed. People who want to lead revolutions don't want to make you free. They want to be your new masters. That's why it is not necessary to join an organization to fight tyranny. A truly fiee society is disorganized. In a fiee society, everyone does exactly what he wants to do and takes orders fiom nobody. Nobody is in charge. Free people don't do what they are told; they only do what they are asked when it is in their own interest or because the person asking also offers something of value like a cash payment, a job, a quick hvor, or even love. Some might think such a disorganized society would be easy to conquer, but it is not. Any society in which people refuse to cooperate unless they agree it's to their own advantage to do so can't be governed except with the permission of all the people or by the massive application of force. It is the \"ordered\" societies, where people are used to doing what they are told to do, that are easy to take over and govern. How This Book Fits In This book describes how individuals can carry out personal campaigns that, when combined with similar campaigns by hun- dreds and thousands of other individuals, will give those who hold political power so much trouble they will soon regret the day they stole freedom. If you are the only person in the country who does these things, you get the personal satisfaction of knowing that there is one free human being left. If a lot of other people start doing the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"same things, we will have an invisible insurgency of freedom. It will be an insurgency that parasitic politicians and their armed enforcers won't be able to put down because they won't be able to$nd it. There won't be any leaders to arrest, no places to send their armed troops, no organizations to infiltrate, no captured insurgents to parade before the media, no activists that the thugs of the IRS, FBI, BATF, OSHA, EPA, or the new Office of Homeland Security can target for reprisals. The total sum of thousands of individual acts frustrating the political leaders will give the appearance of a massive orga- nization. The tyrants will look for leaders who aren't there, secret headquarters that don't exist, and couriers that carry no messages. Instead, all there will be is the invisible resisters, multiplied thousands of times. Once there are enough of them, the time will come when just one of them will initiate the final event in the reign of tyranny. Then others will follow, and sud- denly the streets of America will be clogged with people demanding freedom. We have one more thing going for us. Even though freedom lovers are always in a min~rity,~ they are the most productive, hardest working, creative, and intelligent people in the society. That means that once they begin to resist tyrannical rule instead of cooperating with it, they will have an impact far beyond their small numbers. An Important Warning In the following pages I describe a number of individual actions that are still legal in this country and which help protect the personal freedom of anyone taking such action. I also describe actions some people are already taking that are illegal and could result in their arrest and imprisonment. Finally, I discuss acts of open rebellion and insurrection which might someday be the only hope of ever regaining a fiee society. Any descriptions of current illegal activity or possible hture acts of insurrection are provided for academic study only. The author neither recommends nor advocates that any individual engage in such activities. Indeed, it is the author's conviction that the best way to regain lost fi-eedom is to use every possible legal, nonviolent maneuver without engaging in illegal or violent acts of any kind. 1. For ease of language, the author will use the nlasculine when referring to unidenti- fied individuals. Such a person could, of course, as easily be a womul as a man. 2. North Korea, North Vietnam, and Cuba. China remains a communist country, but only because the leadersllip has managed to suppress the same kind of sudden pub- lic outburst of discontent. Even so, as a result of the Tiananmen Square protests, Chinese leaders were forced to significantly increase the freedoms allowed their cit- izens to keep the lid on more spontaneous revolt. 3. Only one-third of the population in the thirteen American colonies supported the Revolution. Another third supported the British, and the rest hied not to get involved at all."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"I CHAPTER 2 ( WHO WANTS TO BE A GOOD CITIZEN WITH A BAD GOVERNMENT? What is a good citizen? Tyrants describe good citizens as loyal subjects who obey the law-every law-without question. A tyrant's good citizen works hard and pays taxes, even if there's nothing left over to feed the kids. Such a good citizen never complains, no matter how stupid or crude a government official treats him or her. Give a tyrant enough such good citizens and he will rule forever, fat and happy, while his subjects sweat, suf- fer, toil, and die in needless wars to make sure the tyrant keeps living the good life. Tyrants and their lackeys spend a great deal of time and effort trying to convince the people they rule that a moral per- son must be a good citizen.

Bad Citizens Live Better Lives A true constitutional republic has free citizens, not good cit- izens. When people wake up and realize that they don't enjoy all the fieedom they have a right to, the first thing they can do is stop being good citizens. Any tyrant who has a country full of bad citizens has got a problem. A tyrant has all sorts of ways to deal with a rebel, a criminal, a jungle fighter, an insurgent, or a political activist. Those people stand out. They are easily identified, almost like they have signs hung around their necks. One finds such people in dark alleys, basements, forests, jungles, and jails. But how does a tyrant tell a bad citizen from a go.od citizen? Bad citizens, after all, are not bad people. They, too, want to eat, so they'll keep on working at the factory or the office, or planting the potato crop, or playing the stock mar- ket, or creating a new business, or doing whatever else it takes to make a living. What bad citizens won't do is help the government make their lives miserable. They contiilually try to maximize their own personal freedom. They ignore, evade, or break any bad laws to get that freedom. Yet they do so in ways that allow them to remain invisible to the tyrants, who want only good citizens liv- ing in the land. Bad citizens file their income tax returns but cheat while minimizing the risks of getting caught. A bad citizen turns the heat up when the government says the heat should be turned down. Bad citizens lose their census forms, or fill them out incorrectly. They arm themselves for self-defense with the kinds of weapons they want, not what politicians say they can have. Bad citizen don't spend all their time trying to make the work of the government more difficult, but they don't sacrifice their own pleasures or happiness just because some political leader tells them the sacrifices are in the common good. Bad Citizens Can Be Patriots as Well as Good Neiehbors , Just because someone doesn't love bad politicians and would-be tyrants doesn't mean he doesn't love his country. Nor does it mean he is a bad neighbor. People who love freedom love the land, the nation, and the neighborhood they live in. They will be the first to fight criminals, terrorists, or invading armies. They will always be among the first to cooperate with friends and neighbors in achieving mutually desired goals. They will be tol- erant but not nosy, always willing to allow others to exercise their freedom in all things. They will be the best neighbors. Too Manv Bad Citizens Make Bad Government Im~ossible The one big reason why the Soviet Union never worked very well, and eventually collapsed under the weight of massive eco- nomic Mlures, was that too many Soviet citizens realized they were never going to get a fair share out of socialism. They stopped being good citizens of a bad government. They started looking out for themselves rather than the good of the state. Smart citizens don't get caught being bad. They keep what they do a secret. They don't brag to their friends and neighbors about what bad citizens they are. They don't tell the mayor or a county commissioner how proud they are to be bad citizens. They know that to remain free they must be invisible as far as government officials are concerned. The more bad citizens there are, the harder it for the people who steal freedom to stay in power. The tyrant's problem is that he is always outnumbered. He has guns and the thugs to use them. He can build jails, concentration camps, and forced labor detention centers. He has spies and informants and the ability to tap phone lines and search anywhere he chooses. But he can't"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"put everybody in jail. He has to have people to till the fields, drive the trucks, work in the factories, and staff his bureaucracy and enforcement agencies. So he has to convince most of the people that life isn't all that bad and that there is hope of a bet- ter future. The tyrant will go after the visible troublemakers, the guys who loudly announce they will no longer pay taxes, those who detjr the law in front of witnesses and then hole up in an armed compound with a few friends and wait for government enforcers to come and get them, or the ones who fight government from the hills. Those kind of people are easy to identitjr and kill or cart off to prisons. With no newspapers daring to tell the truth about the tyrant, with nobody willing to talk out loud, the tyrant will count on good citizens to continue to act like good citizens once they see what the tyrant can do to bad citizens he can identitjr. Good Citizens Make Tyrants Possible Nazi Germany wasn't filled with people who wanted to throw Jews and Gypsies into gas chambers, make slaves of Eastern Europeans, or rule the world from Berlin. Nazi Germany was filled with good citizens who wanted a political leader they could believe in. In the beginning, even the Jews thought that if they would be good citizens, obeying every law and order, they could survive what was coming. Hider did everything he could to make all good German cit- izens think they were better off with him in charge, even if they did have to give up a few freedoms. Hider was more frightened that all those Germans might stop being good citizens than he was of the Allied armies. He catered to the citizens, he enter- tained them, he promised them better things. And most Germans kept being good citizens right up to the bitter end. Cuba, North Korea, China, Vietnam, Iran, and Iraq are filled with good citizens hoping that by being good citizens they will help things get better. Only things keep getting worse. The good WHO WANTS TO BE A GOOD CITIZEN WITH A BAD GOVERNMENT? citizen works harder but gets less to eat, enjoys life less, and has less hope for a better future. Good citizens brag about working within the system to change things, but nothing ever changes that much. The only time things get better in a country run by tyrants \\ is when lots of people start acting like bad citizens. Back in the days of the Soviet Union, farmers started cheating on the time they spent in the collective fields so that they could spend more time working small private patches where they got to keep or sell what they grew. Eventually those private patches were the only thing that prevented mass starvation. In Poland, a lot of good citizens got fed up with the contin- uing misery resulting from total government control of the economy. So they walked off the job in support of a strike orga- nized by an illegal union. For the first time in years, a bit of free- dom started to creep in. The government uied hard to stamp that out, but eventually the bad citizens won the day. Before it actually happened, very few students of the com- munist world ever expected that it would collapse under its own weight in what was an almost peaceful event. That's because they never saw the invisible resistance that was bubbling through Eastern Europe. As the pot of misery boiled over, more and more people living in those countries started acting like bad cit- izens. Then one day, all those bad citizens for some reason spon- taneously poured into the streets to demand that the tyrants get out of town. Terrorists Don't Like Bad Citizens Either Terrorists expect that the people they target will be helpless to defend themselves, people who won't be armed with weapons or prepared to fight back. They expect people who are condi- tioned to be victims, who cringe in fear when confronted by those who threaten them with violence if orders are not obeyed. They expect people who will silently sit and wait for someone"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"else to save them. On the other hand, a person with the attitude of a bad citizen is the last thing a terrorist wants to face when he tries to perpetrate his evil deeds. Bad Citizens Have Kept America as Free as It Still Is In this country, people who were not being allowed the free- dom they demanded and deserved have repeatedly turned into bad citizens. Every time enough Americans joined in such an invisible insurgency, freedom won the day. The best historical example of bad citizens serving the cause of freedom was the Underground Railroad, which helped thou- sands of fugitive slaves make a run to freedom. The Underground Railroad began when a small number of individu- als decided that slavery was so wrong they were willing to com- mit a felony to help slaves escape their masters. The Underground Railroad was a totally chaotic system, composed of hundreds of individuals, each acting on his own, cooperating only with others he trusted, and almost always with no supervision from any leader. The chaotic nature of the system was what made it so difficult for law enforcement officers to deal with it. Arresting one individual only created a small hole in the net that was quickly filled by others. Most of those who partici- pated in the endeavor were never identified. The Underground Railroad was invisible resistance to tyranny. In 1919, a majority of the voters in the United States decid- ed they knew what was best for everyone and passed the Eighteenth Amendment, taking away the freedom of a man to relax with a beer after an honest day's work. Hundred of thou- sands in this great country chose to be bad citizens. They didn't organize themselves into a \"let's bring back the booze\" political party. They didn't stage massive sit-ins that interrupted the life of a lot of other people. They didn't start blowing up police sta- tions. All they did was keep on drinking alcohol. Other bad cit- izens were more than willing to smuggle or distill or brew the WHO WANTS TO BE A GOOD CITIZEN WITH A BAD GOVERNMENT? booze and sell it for a profit. It took until 1933, but the social manipulators and the do-gooders finally gave up and agreed to throw out the \"Great Experiment,\" and tens of thousands of people went back to being good citizens, at least as far as taking a drink was concerned. \\ In the 1960s, black people in the South got fed up with sit- ting in the back of the bus, getting chased away from the voting polls, and being turned away from the best restaurants and hotels, no matter how much money they had in their pockets. So they started acting like bad citizens. They sat where they pleased, even when threatened with retaliatory violence from the police and politicians of the day. They organized huge voter registra- tions drives, and when their lives were threatened by racist mobs or organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan for doing so, brave blacks armed themselves and shot back in self-defense. Now a black man can go into any public facility he wants, can vote for whoever he wants to, and can eat where he pleases. ' In the 1970s, Dick Nixon gave us the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit, which was absurd on most of the major highways in the United States, especially those in the West. Large numbers of dri- vers not only kept right on driving at higher speeds, but they fig- ured out the best ways to beat the system. A new industry was born and grew rich by selling truckers and motorists radar detec- tors and citizen band (CB) radios so they could help each other keep track of the movements and locations of the highway cops. Eventually so many people were driving faster, especially on many of the interstate routes, that all enforcement efforts became a joke. It took more than 25 years for the petty tyrants in Congress to admit the inevitable, and now people in most western states can drive at 75 miles an hour or more and do it legally. There are still invisible insurgencies going on today. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), other federal enforcement agencies, and state and local police department spend billions of tax dollars each year trying to stamp out the use of recreational drugs. Yet every year the price of illegal"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"and the pharmaceutical industry, we make alnlost all of our daily personal decisions without any interference !?om any govern- ment agent. We decide where we nil1 live and work, what we will eat, how we will grow it or buy it, what we will do for fun, what and where we will worship, how we will spend our free time, and, with some limits, what we will do for recreation. In such a society, the first thing each freedom lover should do is to make the most of all the freedom that can be grabbed while learning how to resist democratic tyranny and regain the freedoms we have lost. Even the new threat of terrorism does not alter this situation. Indeed, to stop any or all desirable activities because of a fear of terrorism is to give in to the goals of the terrorists! There are four steps we can all take to begin the process of protecting our freedoms and resisting the tyranny of a democra- tic mob, even while we help defend ourselves and our country from foreign- based terrorism: 1. Maximize personal freedom. 2. Get educated about freedom and how our politicians are tak- ing it away. 3. Build personal networks of freedom-loving individuals. 4. Spread the truth about the advantages of freedom to others. Step 1: Maximize Personal Freedom As bad as our elected politicians are, they are not responsible for all the misery in our lives. Most Americans who complain about their lack of freedom are not in that fix because of the threat of government violence but because of some other fear. They may fear the disapproval or anger of family, friends, neigh- bors, priests, or even strangers. They may fear economic failure, loss of income, injury, and death by disease, accident, crime, or terrorism. They may fear a final judgment, or even crowds, heights, or enclosed spaces. All too often, many haven't even figured out what they real- ly want. Others want something that is impossible to obtain: they want the love of someone who loves another person; they want to succeed in a profession for which they have no natural talent; they want to find a get-rich-quick scheme; or they dream of achieving happiness by winning a fortune playing the lottery, slot machines, or the race track. Others don't set their own priorities as to what is most important for success and happiness and what they can do without. Instead, they go through life acting on the impulse of the moment. They lose freedom of future choice because they make bad choices in the present. They marry the wrong person or, worse, make babies with someone they don't want to marry at all. They go into debt to buy things they don't need. They can't distinguish between what they must have to survive and what they want because everyone else wants it. They stay stuck in a job they hate because they fear failure more than they want happiness. People n7ho fit into any of the above categories don't have to worry about government thugs locking them up. They are already in cages of their own making. Indeed, such people become easy prey for a political tyrant who will promise them a new world order more to their liking if they will only do what they're told. Instead of looking for freedom, these are the peo- ple who happily march to the drumbeat of tyrants lie Hitler, Lenin, Mao, the mullahs, and whomever will be elected our next president. Before challenging the violent threats of tyrannical politi- cians and their hired thugs, you must first solve all the other problems that prevent you froin maximizing your own freedom of action. Resolve your problems with your family, your job, your friends, your credit rating, and your own emotional fears. Discover what it is you really want, what you can actually achieve, and what you will have to give up in the process. Each individual must make up his own mind about how he can best maximize his own freedom. Your life is your own to"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"live as you see fit. If you make bad or misguided decisions, it is you who will suffer the consequences. For those who never learn to admit their mistakes and start over, those consequences may follow them to the grave. Most often, the consequences will not be violence or the threat of violence. They will be lost opportunities, frustration, out-of-control debt, bad health due to vicious habits, loss of employment, financial failure, and destructive personal relationships. These are problems you have to solve on your own. No one should set out to solve the problems of political tyranny until he has solved the personal problems of his own cre- ation. When you have done that, you will be ready to start chal- lenging the political tyrants trying to control your life. Step 2: Get Educated about Freedom As has been proven time and again, to alter thegovernment in this country does not take violence, bztt education. Myjob is to get the country back into believing and living under the supreme law of the Constitution, not to kill those who are leading the country astray. - Peter McWilliams Almost all of us who want freedom were indoctrinated at some point in our lives by government supremacists. We went to government schools, we studied in colleges under professors who advocated government supremacy, we read the government supremacist propaganda in the daily newspaper, and we watched the government supremacist news on television. We may have grown up in families that believed the lies and myths, and we were surrounded by relatives, friends, and co-workers who shared those beliefs. Yet somehow we broke out of the pack and discovered a true love of freedom. The way that happened is different for each of us. For some, it may have been the frustration of wanting something that was forbidden. We began to wonder why such a thing was forbidden, and the more we examined the situation, the more we realized that there was no good reason why our desire should be denied. For others it may have been a more intellectual enterprise. We discovered the writings of Ayn Rand, Ludwig von Mises, Frederic Bastiat, F.A. Hayek, Milton Friedman, Harry Brown, or some other advocate of freedom. However it started, each of us began a journey of self-edu- cation that we will continue for the rest of our lives. Added to that, education has become easier than ever in the computer age. While most of us once had to depend on the government supremacist press and broadcast media for our news, the Internet now offers dozens of different alternative news sources, some of which are deeply committed to the ideal of freedom. Everyone who wants freedom enough to fight for it should learn as much as possible about the process of living free, even in an unfree society. Such an education should include both the practical aspects of living free and the philosophical justifications of freedom. The fact that the reader is holding this book in his hands is evidence of a desire to learn more about freedom and how to get it. Learning how to avoid the attention of government thugs while living free will be a lifelong task of continuing education. The suggestions made in this book should be considered only the beginning of such an education. One of the most practical aspects of getting educated in the modern world is learning to understand and utilize the tools of the new electronic age. Acquire and learn how to use a personal computer if you have not already done so. No other single thing you can do will be more important in extending your education and your ability to covertly support the cause of freedom. With a computer and an Internet connection, you will have instant access to a vast database of knowledge and information that will make you a more effective invisible freedom fighter. A computer allows you to do the following:"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"INVISIBLE RESISTANCE TO TYRANNY Research laws, regulations, and hundreds of different data- bases on politicians, government, and both the enemies and friends of freedom Find news stories and background information on politicians and bureaucrats that are not covered in the government supremacist media \\ Communicate by a phone connection with any other com- puter anywhere in the world using secure encryption Produce flyers, handouts, letters, and information sheets that can be distributed covertly Store encrypted personal data and information without fear of discovery by overreaching law enforcement agencies or other enemies Learn about the use of firearms, the construction of weapons, and the techniques of resistance If you are still a computer novice, once you get on the Internet, learn to use the search engines like Yahoo, Excite, Lycos, Google, and Alta Vista. Then start searching for infor- mation on these different subjects: Encryption, PGP, computer security, TEMPEST Attack Liberty, libertarian, freedom, Constitution, Bill of Rights Second Amendment, free speech, property rights, gun control Militias, conspiracies Separation of state and school, home education, educational reform, school choice CIA, FBI, BATF, OSHA, FCC, and any other government agency that is threatening your freedom State and local government agencies The names of public enemies of fieedom, including all politicians, leadm of special interest groups, journalists, and media figures . The Internet is a wonderful thing, but what government cre- ates, government can destroy. Therefore, learn how to communicate with computers by telephone without going through the Internet. Anyone who is doing anythmg he wants to keep secret should avoid the Internet and use direct computer-to-computer telephone con- nections along with the best encryption method available. After mastering encryption, learn how to protect your personal data and how to defeat electronic attacks on your equipment. Stev 3: Build Networks of Preedom Search out and identifjr others who share your commitment to freedom and who understand how and why we lost the limit- ed government that was supposed to be our best defense of free- dom. Finding people who share this belief is not always easy. Like you, others have learned that the best way to maximize per- sonal freedom is to avoid the attention of the government supremacists, especially those who hold enforcement power. But isolating us from each other is exactly what the enemies of free- don1 want to achieve. To find others who share your views, start advertising yourself as a freedom advocate. The invisible resister of tyranny doesn't do this by parading in the street carrying protest signs, writing letters to elected representatives and newspapers, confronting politicians in public meetings, debating enemies of heedom in Internet chat groups, running for office as a third party candidate, joining a cit- izen militia movement, or engaging in such open acts of defiance and rebellion as refusing to use a Social Security card or work in a job where the employer collects withholding tax. There are many freedom advocates who are doing such things, and I wish them all well. Likewise, I applaud anyone who chooses to follow their example. However, the only reason polit- ical leaders allow such highly visible rebels to continue to open- ly oppose big government is because they offer no serious threat to a system that is getting bigger and more powerful with every new law passed and every order given. When the highly visible freedom advocates do succeed in"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"seriously threatening the power of the political establishment, they quickly learn the extreme measures that the enemy will take to keep the power it holds. When that happens, it will be the fieedom advocates whom the tyrants don't know exist who will have to man the barricades in the fight for freedom. Those who prefer the route of invisible resistance will have to find their potential allies one person at a time. The way to do this is to make it a point of letting everyone you meet in almost every social situation know where you stand on the issues of individual freedom. This is best done in one-on-one discussions or while engaging small groups of people in every- day social situations. The purpose of this initial activity is not to convert others to the cause of fieedom. What you want to do is find others who already believe in fieedom and who don't like what our elected officials have done with the power inherent in today's big government. To achieve this, do not go around demanding that people listen to your opinions. It is not even necessary to be the one who introduces politics into a conversation. Watch for opportu- nities and when the conversation turns to political elections, gov- ernment programs, gun control, the war on drugs, welfare poli- cies, the public school system, or any other subject concerned with freedom, state your position on the issue. Make it a short, simple statement, but put a bit of feeling into it. Do not engage in long debates, and especially do not get drawn into confrontational arguments. Never advocate any ille- gal activity, make threats of violence, or brag about anything you might have done to frustrate big government. If given an oppor- tunity, do offer a simple explanation for why you think supreme government must fail in the long run. Doing this will not make you a lot of new friends. Indeed, you may find yourself being invited to fewer homes and social I events. What is important is that sooner or later you will identi- fy other people who share your views on freedom. As for the government supremacists you will encounter, even if one of them calls you a dirty name, then turns around and walks off, you have at least forced him to confiont the fact that everyone doesn't agree with the notion that big government is the answer to every human problem. , Ihntifjing and Nurturing Contacts You will soon learn to identify those who agree or at least sympathize with your positions. They will be the ones who vol- untarily express their own disgust with big government or offer their opinions on why they think government doesn't work. They may bring up things like the atrocity at Waco or the bloat- ed perks enjoyed by members of Congress and bureaucrats. Maybe they'll mention that they've read and enjoyed all the works of Ayn Rand or Claire Wolfe, or that they're a member of Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership, or that they've attended a Tyranny Response Team rally. It could be more sub- tle-nods of agreement, interjected words of support, or simply an obvious silent interest in what you have to say. These are the people you want to gravitate toward, feeling them out without alienating or pressuring them in any way. When you make such a contact, get to know them better, and make them your new friends. Introduce them to the friends of freedom you already have, and meet their friends who also share a love of freedom. Look for ways to do things together that will enhance your and their enjoyment of life and fieedom. Here are a few of the kinds of things you can do with friends who share such a love of freedom: Start a discussion or study group that meets regularly to study the issues of freedom. Organize an investment club or a self-help group for dealing with tax problems. Form a cooperative group of parents who home-school their children. Organize and run a private school."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Cooperate in a nongovernment community crime control project. Draw up a barter association for such things as baby-sitting care, home repairs, or legal or other professional services. Put together a circular news list sharing experiences and information on ways to maximize personal freedom. Form a political action committee with a specific goal, preferably with an impact on the local community. Form a sports or recreation group to watch sports, hunt, shoot, fish, bowl, bird watch, play poker, or whatever else pleases those in the group. Set up an e-mail message service to draw attention to prob- lems and opportunities where individual action can maxi- mize individual freedom. Don't make public announcements, openly advertise meet- ings, or tell anyone about the group who hasn't demonstrated a keen interest in freedom. Don't turn these kinds of activities into formalized organizations with elected or appointed leaders and officers. Don't collect dues or attempt to raise funds to be used by the group for \"good causes.\" Anything the group does should be based on voluntary support of time and personal effort. These should be associations of friends, doing things together because each friend gets a worthwhile benefit from the effort they make. Maybe it doesn't even have to be that organized. Maybe the only thing you'll want to do is get together once in a while to party or tell tall tales. It doesn't really matter what you do together. What is important is that you put together a net of people you can trust and who share the same love of individual freedom that you hold dear. Until you have had the experience, you can't imagine how nice it is to sit in a room full of people in which everyone agrees that our government has become the pri- mary enemy of freedom in our lives. Because this is a group of close friends who have learned over the years to trust each other, you vrrill eventually be able to dis- cuss anything relating to fieedom and what can be done about illegal and unconstitutional government. As time passes, the net- work will extend far beyond your own circle of friends to include friends of your friends and then their friends. You will not know everyone in such a net, but you will be able to trust each of them just as you trust your immediate circle. These are relationships that cannot be built overnight. It takes years. It was networks like these that formed the many links that made up the Underground Railroad. This kind of network can play an even greater role in any future emergency should the political frauds continue down their road to tyranny. While such groups of trusted friends can prove to be a pow- erfd tool for frustrating tyranny, they are invisible to the eyes of political leaders, their enforcers, and their supporters. There are no leaders to identifjr, no ways to infiltrate the system, nor eve11 a way to determine that they exist at all. Step 4: Spread the Truth to Others Once you as a freedom lover have taken the above steps, then you are ready to start dealing with those who are still indoc- trinated with the myths of supreme government. That will include a majority of just about everyone else you know. It is easy to understand why so many people believe that supreme government is the answer to all human problems. For more than 150 years, political leaders have been pushing the idea that only they have the answers to all of society's problems. Up until very recently, they were the only voices being heard. They still command our education systems and our media, but the tide is starting to turn back toward freedom-oriented solutions. We have to help that tide by spreading the truth in every way possi- ble. We must always be ready to help others who don't share our love of freedom to better understand why we feel so strongly about the subject."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Most people have never been challenged to think about the myths of supreme government. They have never had a chance to listen to the arguments for freedom. Once they are out of the public school system, they go through life on full automatic, never questioning what the school indoctrination personnel taught them and what politicians keep telling them. The only , way they will ever learn the truth is if someone they like and respect tells them about such things. Yet all too ofien we pass up opportunities to educate others. Too many freedom advocates talk only to each other about these issues. While invisible resisters might not qualifj. as good citizens, they should be good neighbors, cooperative co-workers, and enjoyable social acquaintances, the kind of people who mind their own business, make a decent living, and go out of the way to help someone in trouble that's not of his or her own making. When you start reaching out to friends, relatives, neighbors and co-workers who believe the myths of supreme government, you will talk with a lot of people who won't agree with you. You don't want to make such people think you are a dangerous nut likely to start shooting up the neighborhood. Instead, you want them puzzled by what you appear to be: a good neighbor who has what they believe to be strange ideas but who does not threat- en their safety in any way. The more financially successful, emo- tionally well-adjusted, good-natured, and just plain happy you are, the more impact you will have on those you try to educate. We must not stand dumb while others praise elected politi- cal leaders, welfare programs, government regulation, or the public school system. Instead, every invisible resister should con- sider him or herself to be a covert propaganda machine dropping doubts into the vacant minds of those who have never really thought about what supreme government is doing to us all. The best kind of covert freedom propaganda is a comment or two dropped into a conversation in ways that do not provoke a loud argument but instead encourage new thoughts. If possible, tailor your remarks to fit the concerns of the person or the small group with whom you are talking. Even those who love big gov- ernment get angry about some of the things elected officials and bureaucrats are doing to them. Whether it is someone complaining about the war on drugs, U.S. troops in foreign countries, waste in NASA, high taxes, tax breaks for the rich, webe programs, the court system, oppressive government regulations on business, the probable collapse of the Social Security system before they start drawing payments, or the failure of the government-mandated health care system, you can start out by agreeing with their con- cerns and encouraging their complaints. Then add a comment or two explaining why such government programs must always fd. Look for every opportunity to draw attention to the threat of violence that is behind every government law and action. I am constantly amazed at how many government supremacists total- ly ignore the fact that government is the legalized use of vio- lence. Ask them why the government must use the threat of vio- lence to collect taxes in order to solve the problems of the poor, farm families, the consumer, the drug addict, the gambler, or the failed investor, especially when all of the past programs, agencies, and funding have not worked to solve these ongoing problems. If they don't believe you, allow them to \"discover\" the truth by simply asking them what they think would happen if they chose to withhold a portion of their taxes for something they vehemently disapproved of, be it welfare programs at home, mil- itary adventuring abroad, or whatever. Their answer can only be that armed government enforcement agents will eventually come to their door and forcefully extract the money from them, put them in prison for refusing to conlply, or both. And if they resist in the face of this forceful collection of tax money? They will be shot. Anyone who disagrees with this conclusion is being intel- lectually dishonest or naive in the extreme. People will want to argue with you when you point out the violent nature of big government. Don't fall into that trap. Smile and say something like, \"I'm not trying to convince you that you are wrong, I'm just trying to let you know what I have conclud-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"ed about the situation. I am opposed to government solutions because I am opposed to the use of violence in every situation except self-defense.\" Assure such people that you do understand their point of view. Indeed, you may well have held that point of view once yourself. Explain that you hope they will also try to understand your point of view. Rather than argue, offer to lend them a book (the shorter and more to the point, the better-nobody wants to be burdened with some 500-page tome, no matter how riveting you may have found it), or direct them to sources of freedom information that can be found in the local library or on the Web. Suggest that you will be more than happy to continue the con- versation once they have read such material. Better yet, send them one of the many great works of freedom as a gift. Most of the people we meet in social situations have never had any reason to question what they learned during their indoc- trination in government schools. Educate them on what is real- ly happening, as far as they will allow themselves to be educated. Play on their fears as well. Most supporters of gun control, limits on freedom of speech, or demands for national ID cards don't understand that the final result may be bloody revolution. Warn them about others who are already talking about armed insurgency, who are organizing into secret citizen militia groups, or who are drawing up plans for \"leaderless resistance opera- tions\" if government goes too far. Talk as a person who is clear- ly concerned about a possible violent insurgency but who would never personally get involved in such activity. Another good way to play on the fears of government supremacists is to encourage them to think about how new laws or powers will be wielded by each person's worst political night- mare. If, for example, they are conservative in their views and support more prisons, ask them what would happen if an ultral- iberal like Hilary Clinton became attorney general and got to decide what types of citizens would fill those prison cells? If they are liberal and support government funding of the arts, ask them what would happen if a conservative like Newt Gingrich became head of the National Endowment for the Arts and got to decide what kind of paintings would be approved and disapproved. Along the same lines, if someone complains about a particu- lar politician he dislikes, agree with him and say that it's a shame that we encourage the perpetuation of a government system that hands tremendous power over our lives to such nasty people as Senator X or President Y. If government weren't so big and powerful, these people wouldn't be such a menace, would they? With a little help from you, the person may recognize that plac- ing such power in the hands of individual politicians can have unintended, unsavory, and even dangerous consequences. One tip: tempting as it is, don't openly attack by name indi- vidual politicians who you happen to dislike. Most people are irrationally loyal to particular politicians or will provide knee-jerk defenses of the political party they favor. A better approach is to concentrate on the general potential for abuse inherent in big government and to get people to want to take this power away from politicians whom they dislike. Do this, and the people you deal with socially will know 1' where you stand, but they will have no reason to fear you because of your reputation as a good neighbor and because you never advocate violence in their presence. Indeed, it will be you who questions their commitment to the use of violence to solve social problems. There will be no reason to report you to the local police or a federal agency. As far as the enforcement agents of political leaders are concerned, you will still be an invisible cit- izen, just one more nameless cog in the machine of law-abiding citizens that generates the labor and wealth that actually props up big government. AU of this is the very essence of invisible resistance to tyranny. We must change the world view of those good citizens who keep voting for political frauds. This is a lot more difficult than mak- ing war. But if we really want a free society, we have to destroy the myths that have guided most Americans for so many years."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"This Could Be All It Takes If enough of us initiate the above steps, it could be all we will have to do to turn back the tide of mob tyranny. It will not hap- pen quickly because we will be tearing down the wall of support for government supremacy one brick at a time. It will take years to achieve, even decades, but it can happen. Each person who discovers the meaning of freedom and what it can bring to indi- viduals and to the country can reach two people, who then can reach two more, and those in turn can contiilue to build the chain. It will be a slow-building reaction at first, but eventually, with a continued doubling of the numbers, it will grow into a massive crowd of freedom lovers spread across the country and we will have an explosion of demand for change. It will no longer matter what politicians promise to get elected because no one will believe their lies. If we start spreading freedom by person-to-person contact, once we have just 10 percent of the American citizenry con- vinced that freedom, not supreme government, is the way to build a good society, we will just be three steps from having a massive majority of Americans once again committed to the ideals of freedom. After 10 percent, the next step gives us 20 percent, the second step gives us 40 percent, and the third gives us a massive 80 percent. It may take a long time to reach the first 10 percent, but while we are working on it there are other things we can do to help the cause. CHAPTER 4 ACTIVE RESISTANCE WITHIN TODAY'S SYSTEM Supreme government so permeates our lives that all of us are going to have to obey some laws that we don't like very much. The invisible resister decides for himself which laws he will com- ply with, which laws he will ignore, and which laws he will delib- erately detjr. He makes those choices in ways that best maximize his own freedom, survival, ability to make a living, and success in living the good life. One person might choose to never apply for a Social Security card or to burn the one he has, to make a living in the under- ground economy, and to pay no income tax of any kind. But such a person will probably not own real estate in his own name, open a bank account, or play the stock market. He will also find serious limitations on where he can find work or what profes- sions he can practice. On the other hand, it makes no sense for a talented medical professional to attempt to practice in the underground economy"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"INVISIBLE RESISTANCE TO TYRANNY ACTIVE RESISTANCE WITHIN TODAY'S SYSTEM when he can make much more, even after paying taxes, by work- ing in the regular economy and complying with the many laws regulating the medical profession. Such a professional might comply with the legal requirements but also work off the books treating illegal aliens, Canadians coming south for medical treat- ment, or anyone not covered by medical insurance, Medicare, or welfare assistance. Smart invisible resisters decide the issue for themselves based on the potential total take-home pay and general improvement in lifestyle, not which route requires the least compliance with unjust laws. Invisible resisters to tyranny should live well in the world that exists today while working to build a better world for tomorrow. Look at the issue of driver's licenses as an example of the choices we must make and how we can approach a decision log- ically. It is possible to drive a car for years in the United States without a license or insurance. Indeed, tens of thousands of peo- ple across the country do drive uninsured cars with suspended or expired licenses or no license at all. The smarter ones avoid any contact with law officers by meticulously obeying all traffic reg- ulations. Those who do not can expect continued police harass- ment in the form of traffic stops, followed by arrest, lots of time and money wasted in court, and eventually some jail time. On the other hand, the driver with a legal license, a valid insurance policy, and no outstanding warrants can speed and break traffic laws with little fear of a serious confrontation dur- ing a traffic stop. Such a stop is a minor annoyance and results in a short delay in travel plans, even though the driver will have to pay fines and higher insurance costs as a result of any traffic tick- et. He also runs a higher risk of a serious traffic accident. A third person will get a driver's license, buy insurance, and drive carefully while obeying all applicable traffic laws. Such a persons may drive his whole life without ever experiencing a traf- fic stop. He can, therefore, carry wanted fugitives, loaded weapons, large amounts of cash, and even recreational drugs in the vehicle with little fear of confrontation with a police officer. Again, the most effective participants in invisible resistance are those who have the documentation that good citizens are expected to have and who appear to be honest, law-abiding cit- izens to any government agent who looks them over. Demand Your Rights Because political leaders in the United States still claim that they are governing a free country, they must pretend that they respect the Constitution and all the rights that document guar- antees. The right to free speech, habeas corpus, trial by jury, immunity from testifjring against oneself, safety from search and seizure without a warrant, and legal counsel are still honored, provided that the citizen demands such rights. Invisible resisters will make every effort to avoid a direct confrontation with enforcement officers, but when confrontation does happen, they will do exactly what every citizen ought to do--demand and exercise their constitutional rights. Every resister to tyranny must insist at every opportunity on exercising all rights that government officials, their judges, and their law enforcement officers still recognize and respect. They must do it politely but firmly. Law enforcement officers make a major effort to encourage those they hassle to voluntarily sur- render their constitutional rights in every confrontation. They don't act politely when they do so. They demand and bully with implied threats and outright lies. They even falsely claim that the law requires that you provide such information. When such a confiontation happens, if you have legal identifi- cation, a legitimate address, a telephone number, an occupation or some other form of legitimate income, and no crininal record or outstanding warrants, you are in the best possible situation to demand your rights. Don't give the enforcement officer any of that information unless he can cite a specific law that requires you to do so in the specific circumstances covering the conf?ontation. Ask the cop for his identification. Get his name, badge num-"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"LNVISIBLE RESISTANCE TO TYRANNY ber, rank, and the police agency he claims to represent. If he rehses to provide such information, you are standing on even more solid ground in rehsing to say anything more than \"I want to go now.\" Once you have that information, then let the officer ask his questions. Answer every question by claiming your right to not provide that information under the terms of the Fifth Amendment. The more innocent you are, the firmer you want to be in demanding that right. Never volunteer any information to any government official under any circumstances. If the con- frontation takes place anywhere outside of a car, don't even tell him your name or produce any identification. Don't tell any lies either. Instead, don't say anything at all. If you must say some- thing, ask them questions: \"Am I charged with a crime?\" \"Am I under arrest?\" \"Am I free to go?\" \"Can I call my lawyer right now?\" \"Can you tell me the section of law that applies in this case?\" That last question may be the stumper for the cop. Many enforcement officers don't know the law that well. Often they will insist you are breaking laws that don't exist. The police office won't like your refusal to cooperate, but his only choice will be to let you go your way or to arrest you and risk a false arrest suit. Whatever he does, the more he investigates you, the less reason he will find to continue the investigation and the sillier he will look for having taken on the task. It is even more important to refuse to answer any question if there is something to hide. It is unbelievable how many people put themselves in jail with their mouths. Even with the Miranda warn- ings and all the other protections against self-incrimination, most of the people in jails are there because they talked too much. If government officials show up at your door, don't let them ACTIVE RESISTANCE WITHIN TODAY'S SYSTEM in unless they show you a warrant. If they do show you a warrant, insist on reading it before giving them your permission to enter. If they threaten to use force or begin to use it, do not resist, ever. But do keep saying you do not want them to enter your house, open your bag, search your car, or ask you any more questions. Make notes and write up a detailed memo as soon as possi- ble after you experience such a confrontation. If possible, record the confrontation with a tape recorder or a video camera. If one of your neighbors is part of your network of freedom-loving 1 friends, arrange to have him do the recording surreptitiously so that the cops are less guarded in what they say and do. Never tell them anything about your personal life, who your I fiends are, where you work, or who you know or don't know. Even if you are accused of a crime and are totally innocent, do not answer any questions or cooperate in any way. Police investigators frequently decide who the guilty party is before they have col- lected any evidence. Once they make that guess, they will only look for evidence that supports their jump to a conclusion. They will twist even the most innocent bit of information in ways that support their preconceived judgment. Alnlost all criminals are convicted because they give the police information they don't have to give, or they tell lies that 1 can be easily proven false. The sad fact is that most innocent peo- 'I ple who have been falsely convicted made the same mistake. 1 Ii~formation they gave a police officer thinking it would clear their name ended up as part of a twisted tale of lies and a con- spiracy created by police and prosecutors. Don't tell a policeman anydung until after you have talked to a 1 lawyer, preferably one who is part of your personal network of free- dom advocates. Then let him handle all contact with the police.

No matter how well the poor sucker answers, they sit there I waiting expectantly for the man or woman to continue talking. Nine times out of ten the guy in the jam can't stand the silence, so he starts talking, volunteering information he thinks will con- vince the police officer he is a nice guy. That's the information that puts him behind bars or adds another grand to his income tax bill. Invisible resisters keep their mouths shut when confronting government authority. They keep a smile on their face and stare right back at the bastard. Maybe he can't stand the silence either and he'll spill something that you might find useful. I When your rights are violated, fight back within the law. See a lawyer and take them to court. The Big Lie: Innocent people have nothing to fear by coop- erating with law enforcement officers. Failing to answer reason- able questions will only convince the officer that you have some- thing to hide. The Truth: If a policeman is asking you questions, he doesn't think you are innocent. He may get angry because you won't coop- erate, but he can't do a thing with that anger except stew in it, even ifhe is convinced you are guilty. On the other hand, he will use any- thing you tell him against you, even if you are innocent. Defend Freedom through Jury Duty It is not only the jzrrorJs right, but his duty to find the verdict according to his own best understanding, judgment and conscience, though in direct opposition to the instruction of the court. -John Adarns, 1771 Nothing offers an invisible resister a greater opportunity to strike a blow for freedom than being called to jury duty. Juries have the power to nullify the law with a vote of not guilty, regard- less of the strength of the evidence or the instructions of the judge. From the very beginning of constitutional government in the United States, men and women serving on juries have frus- trated political leaders and their judges by refusing to convict people charged with breaking laws that the jurors found to be unjust. Juries used this power even before the Revolution, when the Thirteen Colonies were still ruled by the king of England. Jury nullification reached epic proportions in the 1850s when juries in the North began returning not-guilty verdicts against anyone charged with violations of the Fugitive Slave Act. Every American called to jury duty still has the power to nul- llfy an unjust law as it applies to the case in which he sits in judg- ment. All it takes is a single vote and the defendant will be found not guilty. Unfortunately, most Americans sitting on juries today don't know they can vote their conscience, even if the judge specifical- ly orders them not to do so. They don't know because judges, politicians, and supporters of supreme government go to great lengths to make sure they never learn that they have this right. It is not taught in public schools. Judges never tell juries they can do it, and they forbid defendants and their lawyers from telling the jury what they can do. Worst of all, judges try to exclude cit- izens who know the17 have that power. This means that anyone who honestly answers a question on the subject while being con- sidered for jury duty is promptly dismissed. It is not surprising that some invisible resisters are lying to the judge when asked the question about their willingness to fol- low the judge's instructions. Such resisters have learned how to cheat the judge and prosecutor when sitting on a jury trying a case where the law is patently unjust or unconstitutional. They listen closely to the evidence, looking for any inconsistencies in the prosecutor's case. They identify prosecution witnesses who could be logically challenged during jury deliberation. Good choices for such suspicious witnesses are law enforcement offi- cers. If the president of the United States tells lies in court, why should we believe anyone down the line of command? Other impeachable witnesses include those who participated in the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"crime and then plea-bargained for lesser sentences if they ratted out their partners in crime, jailhouse witnesses who turn state's evidence for special privileges, and any witness who is contra- dicted by another witness. In jury deliberations, such an invisible resister never makes any mention of jury nullification or challenges the constitution- ality of the law in any way. Instead he insists that he is convinced that either the evidence was fabricated or doesn't prove the case, or that a key witness was lying. At the least, he will hang the jury. He may even convince his fellow jurors that the case was not proved and win an acquittal. Fortunately, in the age of the Internet one can easily learn all about jury nullification. Do a Web search on the words \"jury nul- lification\" or start at www.fija.org. You will be glad you did. Most of us will never be called to serve on a jury. Many of those who are called will sit for cases in which the defendant is charged with a violent crime that deserves punishment if the evi- dence proves he is guilty. But if an invisible resister finds himself sitting on a jury deciding a case in which the defendant is accused of tax evasion, illegal drug activity, laws controlling firearms, or a violation of any of the many other unjust laws that government supremacists use to limit our freedom, he or she will have an opportunity to strike for freedom by voting not guilty. This is not easy to do. Other jurors who are lovers of supreme government may be determined to lock the defendant up for the rest of his life. It takes strength of character to stand alone in such a situation, but men and women of strong will and a commitment to freedom can do it. Whatever happens, the committed invisible resister will stand his ground. You don't even have to argue your case. All you have to do is have the guts to cast the one vote that hangs the jury. Z5e Big Lie: Jurors must follow the instructions of the judge. Z5e Truth: The American jury system is based on the idea that ordinary men and women are more competent to judge the ficts and the law than hired professionals who are beholden to the political leaders who give them their jobs. Judges have no authority to interfere in the deliberations of a jury, which are supposed to be secret and private. Be an Armed Citizen Every freedom-loving American ought to be familiar with firearms and have at least a few in his possession. If for some rea- son you don't already own firearms or you don't know how to use them, make that your first priority in becoming an invisible resister to tyranny. The more decent and peaceful people there are who own personal firearms, the more difficult it will be for some future political leader to collect them all. Just as important, the more likely it will be that a criminal or a terrorist will find his plans terminated by an armed citizen. If current political trends continue, sooner or later our gov- ernment will try to round up all the firearms in private hands. So in anticipation of that event, collect at least one and hopefully more firearms that are not listed in your name and address on any federal, state, or local government records. At least for now, they can be acquired through private sales. New widows, old men who no longer hunt, people with financial problems, and others often offer used rifles, shotguns, and even an occasional pistol for sale. Sometimes such weapons are fairly old and may not have been registered at the time of the first sale. Even if they were, people selling their own used guns usually don't ask for identification or make any effort to verifjr and record the name of the buyer. Don't forget to keep plenty of ammunition on hand, bought in small quantities at different places. Being armed is the litmus test of the true lover of freedom. Ask anyone you think might be interested in joining your free- dom network if he owns a firearm. If he answers no, explain to him the vital importance of an armed citizenry in a truly free society. If he continues to resist the idea, you will know that he has accepted the lies of the government supremacists."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"INVISIBLE RESISTANCE TO WNY ~CTIVE RESISTANCE WITHIN TODAY'S SYSTEM 7he Big Lie: No one has any reason to own a firearm. It is the duty of the police and the authorities to protect you from crime. Guns are dangerous, and gun owners are more likely to injure themselves or innocent parties than criminals. They buy and sell weapons at gun shows and from their homes or offices without a federal firearms license (FFL). They modifjr semiautomatic weapons to be capable of full automatic fire.

If you are the victim How Othem Ianove Gun Control Laws No set of unconstitutional laws are broken in more ways than the thousands of gun laws currently on the books. It is not just criminals who break those laws. Thousands of invisible resisters break them every day without much fear of arrest or prosecution. For example: I They fail to register or turn in weapons declared to be sub- I ject to special regulations, such as certain types of rifles described as \"assault rifles.\" They keep their weapons loaded and ready to use in the home, even when they have children in the house. 1 They carry concealed weapons in their cars, even when they I pick up their children at school. I~l of violent crime, they will show up after the fact and make a perfunctory investigation, which usually does not result in They build homemade silencers for some of the weapons they own. If they must use an illegal gun in self-defense, they dispose of the dead criminal or leave him lying dead on the pavement without notifjring the police. On the other hand, private gun owners legally use firearms to prevent crimes a million or more times a year, almost always without having to fire a shot. Most criminals won't consider I attacking anyone they suspect of being armed. When looked at from a statistical point of view, gun owners have a remarkable safety record in the use and ownership of firearms. an arrest. Police do get professional credit for arresting crim- I inals, but given a choice, they will always go after the crimi- nal less likely to harm them before they will chase someone really dangerous. Resist Taxes ill No true freedom lover would pay a dime in taxes to support supreme government if he had any choice. We pay taxes because we fear the people our fellow citizens elect to power. Taxes so permeate the economic structure of our society that it is almost impossible to avoid all of them. It is possible to live on such a small income that one will not have to pay any income tax, but such a person will still have to pay Social Security taxes on any wages earned and, in most states, sales tax on anything they buy from any ordinary merchant. Even so, if someone is determined to give the political parasites as little as possible while maintaining a reasonably comfortable lifestyle, there are many ways to legally reduce the amount of money paid for taxes. One way is to adopt a frugal way of life in which the amount of time spent earning income is minimized and the amount of time spent in leisure activities that create untaxed wealth in the process is maximized. Such people grow their own vegetables and fruits, and they raise a few chickens, a couple of cows, and maybe a pig or two. Hunting, fishing, gold prospecting, scav- enging by metal detector, firewood gathering, and Dumpster diving are recreations that can produce untaxed wealth. Growing numbers of married couples are discovering that the best way to legally lower the family income tax burden is to go back to the old-fashioned single-income Life in which one"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"INVISIBLE RESISTANCE TO TYRANNY ACTIVE RESISTANCE WITHIN TODAY'S SYSTEM paruler works at a job while the other becomes a full-time home preparers make money by preparing returns that do not attract an worker who spends the day caring for the children instead of audit. When in doubt they always decide in fivor of the IRS, not putting them in expensive day care centers. The home worker the person paying for their services. can shop for bargains for th; necessities of life, prepare meals from basic ingredients, sew clothes, make household repairs, and do the mechanical work on the well-used family jalopy. Such a frugal family not only significantly reduces the amount of money paid for federal and state income taxes and Social Security taxes but also the amount spent on sales taxes. They will also be build- ing an old-hshioned family life in which children learn to respect the fanlily customs, religion, and moral values. Such couples often home-school their children as well. If a significant percentage of the two-income families went back to living this way, the impact on the government's financial structure would be cataclysmic. Elected politicians would be scrambling for ways to make up the lost revenue. Their only choice might be to reduce the size of government. Those who opt for more a more frugal lifestyle find that they are enjoying living without the many luxuries they once thought a necessary part of the good life. They will spend more time with the family, engage in more creative and self-satisfjring recre- ations, and build up financial resources which can be put to work in investments. The profits from such investments will still be taxed, but at a lower rate than the taxes imposed on the salaries of the double-income fanlily. Furthermore, investment profits are not subject to the taxes of the Social Security Ponzi scheme. Every invisible resister should look for every possible way to legally deny tax money to every level of government. To do that, one must have a sound understanding of the tax system. The politicians have made it extremely complicated for a very good rea- son: they figure that the more complicated it is, the more people will decide they have to go to a professional tax preparer. And guess who the professional tax preparer is most interested in keep- ing happy? Is it you, the taxpayer? Or is it the bureaucrats at the IRS and the tax agencies of the dfierent states? Professional tax Unless you have a complicated tax situation involving tens of thousands of dollars owed, take the time to learn to prepare your own tax return. It is not as hard as most people imagine, espe- cially if you have access to a personal computer. There are lots of good books, computer programs, and even a few Web sites that will help you understand the process. Claim all deductions and I' exempuohs for which you can qualify. When in doubt, err in your own favor. The odds are overwhelmingly good that you will never I be audited, even if you make a wrong decision in your own favor. Every invisible resister should become familiar with the vari- 1 ous ways of legally avoiding taxes. These include such things as I using individual retirement accounts (IRAs), moving money into the international investment economy, and manipulating the buying and selling of investments in ways that decrease the tax I liability. This subject is too large to deal with completely in this I1 book, but it must be part of the education of every invisible resister who intends to do well financially while maximizing per- sonal freedom. I Never Let the Bastards Owe You Money I This may sound strange, but you always want to owe money to the IRS and your state tax agencies every year. If you receive a refund every year, you are cheating yourself and supporting supreme government because you are needlessly giving them more of your money to waste rather than letting it gather inter- est in your own bank account. If you receive a tax refund from the IRS, increase the num- ber of deductions you report to your employer to the point where you end up owing money. (As long as you don't owe more than 10 percent of the taxes owed at the end of each quar- ter or pay estimated taxes if you do, you won't be charged any penalties.) Instead of waiting for $1,000-a-year tax refund, open"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"an interest-bearing bank account into which you deposit enough every month to cover any tax shortfall at the end of the year. Then pay the taxes you owe for the past year on April 15, but not a day earlier. This way the money stays in your bank account gathering interest as long as possible rather than being shoveled into the wasteful furnace of government spending no sooner than it has to. Don't do anything that makes it easier for them to process your return. If you are not expecting a refund, there is no reason to pay extra to file an e-mail return. Use the long form, even if you could use the short form. Fill out your returns in long hand. But there is a fine balance here. You don't want to do anything so blatant or over the top that you trigger an audit because some malevolent government accountant became annoyed. Needless to say, scrawling anti-IRS messages on the envelope or smearing your return with feces is not recommended either. A Tax Audit-A Chance to Fight Back Anybody who gets audited should look at it as an opportu- nity to legally fight the system. The IRS is infamous for its mis- take percentages. Anyone who believes he is a victim of such a mistake should challenge the assessment, following the IRS guidelines for doing so. He should raise the challenge as far as it can go up the ladder within the system. The Fifth Amendment protects taxpayers in their dealings with the IRS just as it protects them in all dealings with political authority. The return and the documents kept in support of the return stand by themselves. A taxpayer has the right to refilse to answer any questions about the return or such documents. If the sums in dispute are considerable, this is the time to hire a tax lawyer. The taxpayer doesn't even have to go to the audit; a lawyer can represent him instead. Invisible resisters should not waste time and effort trying to challenge the legality of the tax system. Tax protesters who openly refuse to pay ally tax while arguing that the Sixteenth 7 ACTIVE RESISTANCE WITHIN TODAY'S SYSTEM Amendment was never legally ratified, that the IRS use of the term \"voluntary\" really means it is voluntary, or that the word \"income\" does not mean what the tax bureaucrats say it means may be making philosophically correct arguments. 1t doesn't make any difference. As we saw in the Freemen standoff in Montana back in 1996, once government enforcers decide to go ' after you, the taxes and penalties will be collected, the judge won't let you tell the jury why you shouldn't be in court, and ' you will end up in prison for many years. The invisible resister facing a confrontation over his tax 1 return wants the tax enforcers to think he is a good citizen who simply didn't understand the law or who tried to be a little too ) clever for his own good.

Many Do Cheat on Taxes Tens of thousands of invisible resisters go much further in fighting taxes than manipulating the amount they owe by 1 changes in their lifestyle and taking advantage of every loophole. I Instead of just legally avoiding taxes, they deliberately evade I them. Schemes for successfully doing that include the following: Working off the books in the underground economy, either 'I as a full-time occupation or at a part-time second job Engaging in barter arrangements Deliberately cheating on personal deductions, business I expenses, and financial losses and failing to report cash income not reported to the IRS on 1099 forms Hiding wealth and investments in foreign bank accounts Evading state sales taxes by buying products from a state with no taxes or through mail order or Internet purchases No one in or outside of government has any real idea how"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"many people are cheating on their income taxes. No one knows how much money such individuals save for their own use through tax evasion. Some observers claim that if everyone who was avoiding income tax paid what they supposedly \"owe,\" we could retire the national debt in a few years. Everybody does agree that the number of tax cheats is in the millions, and that tax cheating is a rapid growth industry in America. What is obvious is that we have reached the point where leg- islative attempts to raise tax rates are more likely to reduce rev- enues collected as more citizens opt for tax avoidance or evasion. The Big Lie: People who evade taxes are cheating their fellow citizens, who must pay more to cover the shortfall. The Truth: Politicians will spend every extra dollar they can collect. Should they magically figure out a way to collect all the taxes now lost through tax evasion, they would not reduce tax rates or the national debt. Instead they would increase spending. In fact, their success in collecting money previously lost through tax evasion would probably embolden them to raise the rates even more. Every tax evader is an invisible resister willing to take extra risks in increasing his personal freedom. It does have risks, and I don't suggest or encourage anyone to take those risks. But we need to understand the phenomenon and explain to others why it happens, why most don't get caught, and why it will never be stopped as long as we keep electing frauds, crooks, and parasites to political office. mary purpose of government schools to not be education but the indoctrination of children. Johnny can't read or figure arith- metic because government teachers are not there to teach him such skills. They are there to teach him to love supreme govern- ment and to reject anything his parents might try to instill in him that would interfere with Johnny growing up to become a com- pliant slave of tyrannical politicians. If at all possible, don't put your children in any government school or, for that matter, a private school that is controlled by the government's educational bureaucrats. Home-teach your 1 children, or form a small cooperative teaching arrangement with I a few other parents. If that's not possible, make the sacrifice to put your children in a private school that deliberately resists the political indoctrination techniques of the government school sys- tems. Yes you will have to pay the full cost of your child's edu- 1 cation while continuing to pay the taxes that support govern- ment indoctrination centers, but the trade-off is worth it. If you must use public schools, get directly involved with I your child's education and learn what is going on while he is in school. Ask questions about what was learnedand how the class spent its time. Don't be concerned about grades, especially grades in courses that are pure political indoctrination. The more you learn about what goes on during the school day, the less happy you are going to be. (Believe me, I've been there, I've done that.) I have one friend in my freedom net who is a logger.

When they ask questions about such things, politely decline to answer, telling them that is private information you do not wish to share outside your family. Do ask them questions about their training, their education, and their life experiences. Also ask if they are members of a union and what their political affiliation is. If they should ask for your support on school bond issues, teacher pay negotiations, classroom size, and similar teacher con- cerns, tell them politely that you will only consider supporting such things when you are satisfied that they are doing a good job of educating your children. Make complaints to school board members, administrators, and teachers about so-called political- ly correct agendas. Create a situation in which anyone associat- ed with the school who sees you coming gets nervous. Teach your kids from the time they are old enough to under- stand that they should not share any family or personal informa- tion with school personnel unless they check with you first. Make sure your children understand that it is you and them against the system, and that you are on their side in any con- frontation they may have with their teachers. Don't let a teacher dictate how you spend time with your children. One favorite ploy of some teachers to gain control of the child and the family is to assign homework projects that require parental participation. Sometimes these are nothing more than crude attempts to find out personal information ; about the family. On other occasions they assign projects , designed to indoctrinate the whole family with government supremacy dogma. The child is told to enlist the parent's help with an environmental project of some kind, such as finding new ways to recycle household waste, or getting involved in an elec- tion campaign or a conlmunity project. Get directly involved with what your children do when not in school, but educate them in the things that are important to you and the your family.

PLAYING POLITICS AND THE GOVERNMENT GAME I In modern America, the politicians who win elections are not , hoi~orable people. Indeed, our political process has deteriorated to the point where an honorable person cannot win political office, and the things that politicians must do to get elected guarantee that they are not honorable. The less one has to do with such people, the better. Dealing with Politicians I I Invisible resisters never treat a politician with the respect an ' honorable person deserves.

When they receive mail requesting a donation to help a politician get into office, they send the postage-paid envelope back empty. Better yet, they print up and insert a flyer explaining why they will not support such a fraud- ulent campaign. When one of these despicable political creatures appears in front of a workplace or at a sporting event and sticks his hand out to an invisible resister to ask for his vote, the resister keeps his hand in his pocket and gets confrontational. He smiles and speaks politely, but in no more than a sentence or two he tells the politician why he would never vote for such a parasitic liar. Better yet, the resister asks an embarrassing question, like why the politician voted for a clearly unconstitutional piece of legis- lation or why he raised taxes. The invisible resister never makes any threats or says anything that could be interpreted to be threatening. He just makes the point that he considers the can- didate beneath contempt and not worth the time it would take go to the polls.

The current political system is so corrupt that voting is always a bad choice between nvo evils. Even if there were a perfect candidate for a freedom lover on the ballot, your or my vote won't make any difference in who gets elected or how he or she governs. At most, it is a feel-good exer- cise for the individual. If voting makes you feel good, do it.

They will find that politicians are more afraid of noise in the streets than the votes of minor third parties. This has been demonstrated by the effective street protests of the group Tyranny Response Team against gun control in Colorado and elsewhere as well as the recent successful assault by Tennessee taxpayers against the state capital when their \"representatives\" tried to secretly pass a tax increase. In the Tennessee case, motorists circled the building and blared their horns in protest, while others demonstrated loudly but peacefully outside. The measure did not pass. Those who prefer to be invisible resisters should concentrate on educating others about why the political system has become so corrupt that voting only contributes to the corruption and helping the tyranny grow. The Big Lie: Those who don't vote have no right to complain about politicians who win. The Truth: Those who are threatened with violence and fraud not only have a right to complain but the right to resist. Just because we don't help choose the criminals who will rob us doesn't mean we have no right to fight back. What about Telephone Calls, Letters, and E-mail to Congress? Telephoning, sending e-mail, or writing letters to con- gressional representatives or state legislators has about as much impact as a single vote on election day-that is, not much. Elected politicians are more interested in the polls and the street noise than they are in totaling up the letters that flood their offices in support or opposition to various pieces of legislation. The elected official almost never even sees the let- ter, which is instead answered by staff assistants with a prewrit- ten form letter. A major reason why letters demanding more freedom don't have any impact on the legislator's thinking is that they are in such a small minority of the total numbers of messages from con- stituents. Almost all voter correspondence contains a request for help in getting some kind of government benefit or a demand for new laws granting such benefits. The occasional letter demanding less government, lower taxes, or an end to privileges I for special interest groups won't have any impact on the elected official as long as so many more people are clamoring for a place at the trough of government plunder. Anonymous letters threatening elected officials may have more impact on political parasites than carefully drafted letters from freedom-loving citizens demanding less government. Of course it is illegal to do this, not to mention difficult and dan- gerous, and anyone who does write such a letter will find him- self under investigation and, if caught, charged with a crime. Even so, members of Congress with reputations for especially vicious support for gun control, ridiculously higher taxes, and harsh drug control laws do receive large amounts of hate mail. While they claim it doesn't affect their political positions on such subjects, one can wonder what the impact would be if there was a flood of such mail with postmarks from their congressional dis- tricts or, in the case of senators, their states. At this time, it is much more useful to spend time and effort trying to convince those we know why our elected representatives are frauds and charlatans and worth neither respect nor honor than it is in trying to influence the representatives directly. Who Really Influences The Political Process? Contrary to the popular mythology, politicians are not con- trolled by the monetary donations of corporations and big busi- nesses. Business enterprises do donate lots of money to political campaigns, but that money would better be called extortion, paid to keep government regulators off their backs.

Often they gain nothing at all. Many members of special interest groups may even lose more than they gain. For example, teachers who are much more com- petent than their colleagues or have special expertise that should demand higher salaries can only earn the negotiated union salary based on years served and additional education credits tallied. Meanwhile, their less competent, lazier co-workers are rewarded for doing their jobs poorly. On the other hand, the leaders of special interest groups gain great personal profit, prestige, and political influence by their activism. Often they are self-appointed rather than elected. They can control millions of dollars in funds with little or no account- ing. They live off the same fraud that supports modern political leaders-the idea that supreme government can solve the prob- lems of those who elect their candidates to office. They deserve no more respect or prestige than the political hacks they influ- ence and often control. They are the primary supporters of gov- ernment supremacy and therefore true enemies of freedom. Jesse Jackson, Sarah Brady, Ralph Nader, Al Sharpton, and Jerry Falwell are examples of such enemies of individual freedom. No invisible resister will provide support or encourage- ment to any of these handmaidens of tyranny. Instead they will point out the fraudulent message of such special interest groups in their efforts to educate others about freedom and its benefits. Invisible resisters will also employ the same tactics used against politicians when dealing with such groups in pub- lic confrontations or while responding to their junk mail solic- itations for hnds.

That's why many business enterprises donate large sums of political tribute to both major political parties. Almost always it is a fool's enterprise.

Such groups include all labor unions, political action committees, race-based groups like the NAACP, organizations like the American 1 Association of Retired Persons (AARP) representing the elderly and retired, many religiously oriented groups, manufacturing I1 and trade associations, consumer groups, and dozens of different activist groups ranging from environmentalists and animal right- ists to anti-death-penalty and prisoner rights advocates.

If you want a free country, you have to start with yourself. That's what the previ- ous two chapters and this chapter are all about-the concrete steps that each individual can take to start the process. A free and just nation must have a foundation of people who demand the right to control all aspects of their own lives and who grant that same right to all others. Everyone in the nation doesn't have to be that kind of per- son. A majority of the population doesn't even have to think that way. Human nature is such that all societies will always have the indolent and lazy who beg for a living, those who want someone else to make all their decisions and keep them safe from every harm, and those who pander to such people in order to gain the power to rule them.

In every instance, except for the mili- tary occupation of Japan and the western part of Germany after World War 11, the new order proved to be less free than the soci- ety that was \"rescued\" from disaster. In the 20th century, the two notable countries that suffered the most total and complete economic and political collapses were Russia in 1917 and Germany in the 1920s and early 1930s. Look what kind of governments they got after their breakdowns. The horror of nuclear weapons and the threat of biological or chemical weapons by terrorists does introduce a new factor. Some natural event such as a cataclysmic asteroid strike might be even worse than the aftermath of nuclear war. Yet even in those situations, we won't get the predicted anarchy. Why? Because the best prepared survivalists in the nation are our top elected officials and the men and women they have appointed to high office. They will escape in their helicopters and jet planes to their hidden underground retreats. (This is exactly what we saw happening after the attacks of September 11 .) They have made sure they will be among the living and able to communicate with each other and whatever troops are still available for duty. When the smoke clears they will come out to take over again. Then they will use the catastrophe as the excuse to increase their power. Normal survivalists won't be defending their caches of food, supplies, and weapons from roving bands of armed criminal raiders. They will be fighting organized military units sent out by the government to confiscate such caches for \"the common good.\" The greatest danger from a natural, economic, or war catastrophe is not anarchy but the total loss of our freedom through the imposition of a totalitarian government to \"save\" us from such anarchy.

Before the Great Depression of the 1930s, the idea of a forced retirement plan paid for at a 15 percent tax on all income would have led to armed rebellion. Now those nearing the age when they can collect Social Security would go to war to keep the promised benefit! There were no federal gun control laws before alcohol pro- hibition, and only a few states like New York had any controls at all. When federal politicians faced a massive expansion of crimi- nal organizations as a result of Prohibition, they wanted to put some kind of control on the sale and possession of machine guns and sawed-off shotguns. However, they didn't make them illegal because they knew that was unconstitutional. Instead they imposed a high tax on them. Because mob criminals never paid the taxes, they could then be prosecuted for tax evasion. However, the taxes were sufficiently high to discourage ordinary citizens from buying or making such weapons. Over the past 100 years, our political leaders have repeatedly taken similar small steps, with each one imposing more severe restrictions on constitutional li-eedoms and libemes. Each new mea- sure was justified with an explanation that it was required for the common good, perhaps to save the elderly from starvation, to stop the spread of disease, to halt criminal activities, to save the country fiom anarchists, or, the favorite excuse of our age, to \"protect the children.\" No single step was ever so extreme that it provoked peo- ple to take up arms against unjust government. Yet the cumulative effect has brought us to the point where liberty in this nation is about to be drowned in the political promises of good intentions. This is the sneaky path to tyranny. If we are to avoid the final enslavement, we must realize what is happening and start taking action to stop it before it is too late for each of us to do anything at all. When politicians take free- dom away in small steps, it's hard to determine at what point we are justified in fighting back rather than just avoiding the impact of government on our lives. Again, take a look at the situation with gun control. First, political leaders denied convicted felons the right to possess a firearm, even those who had completed their sentences and lived for years as law-abiding citizens. Next they added those treated for mental illness, then teenagers, then those convicted of domestic violence. Serious restrictions have been placed on who , can sell a firearm, and now we must all get a clearance from some law enforcement agency before we can buy a gun from a dealer. Now politicians and government supremacists are demanding the licensing of firearm owners. If we continue down this road, we will eventually see the confiscation of all weapons in private hands, and it will be easy to do. The number of people still legal- ly owning weapons will be reduced to a much smaller number, ) and their names and addresses will be recorded on a master list. At the same time, the number of enforcement officers loyal to I the tyranny will be much larger, and they will be much better armed than they are today. Once we are disarmed, we can expect an accelerated attack on all other freedoms. There will be no national catastrophe, no sudden threat of anarchy, nor for that matter an internment of large numbers of citizens in concentration camps. In fact, the day after our politicians deprive us of the last bit of liberty won't be much different than the day before. The banks will still be open, people will be going to work, there will be food on the shelves at the grocery store, and school doors will be open for the daily indoctrination of our children. The street lights will be on, telephones will work, and water will run from household taps. We will probably even be allowed to vote for candidates for political office, and our ballot choices will promise the same old things. But we won't have any firearms. We won't find books like the one you hold in your hands. The Internet will be a dull and insipid cyberspace with every Web site bearing a government stamp of approval. We'll find the same kind of government- approved fare emitted from our TVs and radios. We'll probably need government permission to get a job or change jobs, and"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"we'll spend long hours and weekends doing \"voluntary\" work on farms, roads, municipal stadiums, and waste-processing sta- tions. We'll be constantly showing our sophisticated identifica- tion documents every time we enter a bank, take in a movie, board a plane, or when a policeman thinks we look suspicious while walking down the street in the middle of the day. All infant children will spend the work day in government care centers. Becoming a parent may even require a license, with any children not born to licensed parents becoming wards of the state. Prisons will be filled with criminals arrested for speaking \"lies\" about political leaders, plotting insurrection, smoking cig- arettes, and perhaps even eating red meat or getting too fat. At different steps along the way, the rights to trial by jury, freedom of the press, and being secure from unreasonable search and seizure will all have been first compromised and then suspended. The most pernicious thing about the sneaky path to tyranny is that each additional step represents such a small additional inconvenience that most citizens will decide it is not important enough to justifjr vigorous resistance. The political parasites will use the techniques of divide and conquer. They will aim first at one group of citizens, then anoth- er, and then still another. In one instance they will limit the free- wheeling Internet by first imposing taxes on on-line sales, then introducing censorship for provocative Web sites. Mer that they will go for more limitations on Second Amendment rights and gun manufacturers. Then they will switch their legislative atten- tion to something like the petroleum industry. With a small vic- tory there they will bounce to a renewed attack on the tobacco companies, or maybe the pharmaceutical industry. Next it will be an attack on logging or mining, or maybe more restrictions and impositions on private health care. And sure as night follows day, they will use every natural cat- astrophe, threat of war, act of criminal madness, or terrorist inci- dent as another excuse to ratchet up the rack of tyranny. Each sneaky step toward bigger and more supreme govern- ment will be applauded by most citizens as a welcome new pro- tection from criminals, bankers, gun nuts, tax evaders, pornog- raphers, polluters, monopolists, racists, child abusers, or greedy pharnlaceutical executives. The final effect will be the total supremacy of political leaders over every aspect of our lives, and a citizenry so conditioned to be slaves to supreme government that they cannot imagine a situation in which politicians and bureaucrats don't make every important decision in their lives. If this occurs, every invisible resister to tyranny will be forced to decide whether he or she is morally and pragmatically justified in doing everything possible to fight back, even if that means tak- ing violent reprisals against the agents of the oppressor. The point at which that happens will differ from one individual to the next. One person might decide that a prohibition on Web sites with unpopular political commentary is the turning point at which armed resistance is the only choice. Another may decide to wait , until goon squads start going house to house to collect unregis- tered computers and arrest those who don't comply. Whatever the personal decision, all of us who love freedom must have a clear point in mind in which we will say to ourselves, \"I can't take it anymore. It's time to start fighting back however I can.\" We hope that will never happen, and the only way to prevent it is to build our networks of freedom and start changing the way those around us think about freedom and what dependence on politicians does to freedom. The beauty of invisible resistance to tyranny is that we don't all have to make such difficult decisions at the same point in time. There are already people who have cllosen to become invisible resisters, ignoring, evading, and breaking laws that unjustly limit their freedom or demand their wealth. There will be more who make those decisions with every new limitation the political parasites put on us. Hopefully, one day there will be so many of us engaged in active invisible resistance to tyranny that corrupt politicians will start fearing not just that they will lose the next election but that they may even lose their fortunes I"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"and perhaps even their lives if they continue to push the limits of our tolerance.

The banks will still be open, people will be going to work, there will be food on the shelves at the grocery store, and school doors will be open for the daily indoctrination of our children. The street lights will be on, telephones will work, and water will run from household taps. We will probably even be allowed to vote for candidates for political office, and our ballot choices will promise the same old things. But we won't have any firearms. We won't find books like the one you hold in your hands. The Internet will be a dull and insipid cyberspace with every Web site bearing a government stamp of approval. We'll find the same kind of government- approved fare emitted from our TVs and radios.

So while we hope that day never arrives, every lover of individual freedom must be prepared to make the decision of what to do should our worst fears become I a reality. CHAPTER 7 SHOULD TOTAL TYRANNY COME What will you do when this happens? Your favorite radio and TV stations are off the air. All the remaining stations are broadcasting exactly the same news about the dangerous situation that required the president to proclaim martial law. The federal government orders all firearms and ammunition in private hands to be immediately turned in to local collec- tion centers operated by city or county government. The TV news shows clips of police SWAT teams breaking down doors, searching houses, and arresting people who didn't comply with the order to turn in firearms. The president announces that because of the serious securi- ty threat, the upcoming elections will be suspended until the government is able to guarantee the safety of everyone going to the polls."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The government issues new currency and orders all old cur- rency to be immediately traded in for the new. The old money is no longer considered legal tender. No one can trade in more than $500 worth of old currency. The president goes on national TV to announce the arrest of a gang of terrorists accused of planning to blow up major monuments and government buildings in Washington. As the screen flashes pictures of the suspected terrorists, you recognize the presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party in the last election; a movie star who had been a vocal advo- cate in the support of the Second Amendment; a well-known publisher of books on survival, small-unit military tactics, and martial arts; and two congressmen who had been vocal opponents of the president's economic policies. Don't Run for the Hills to Fight for Freedom You say that when things get that bad, you are going to take to the hills, that you've got a food and weapon stash waiting for just this kind of thing to happen? You're going to do what the French Resistance and the Yugoslav partisans did against the Nazis, what some Filipinos did against the Japanese, and what the Afghans did against the Soviets. You're going to try to win freedom back through force of arms. More power to you, and lots of luck. You'll need it. You'll also need a lot of people in the hills with you. If you don't already know who they are and have the plans already made for what you and they are going to do, your chances of lasting out the month will be about zero. If you have been an active member of a citizen militia group that has planned for such a situation, then maybe you'll have some chance of survival, at least for a while. That's provided that your unit is led by men who have never been openly identified as leaders of such a group. Those who have been, even though SHOULD TOTAL TYRANNY COME everything they were doing was legal when they were doing it, will be at the top of the arrest lists. Frankly, freedom fighters in the hills haven't been very suc- cessful at winning liberty in this century. They get lots of press and they die glorious deaths, but they very seldom end up free, even when they win. That's because organized armed partisans with any hope of victory require leaders, organizations, and a chain of command. Unfortunately, almost always there is no real difference between the political leader who wins office through an election and the one who gains power by leading a revolution. They are in the game to serve their own selfish desires and emo- tional needs, never the desires and needs of those who die to put them in office or the survivors who vote to keep them there. There has only been one revolution in the history of the world, the American Revolution, that ever delivered on its promises of greater freedom. Unfortunately, those promises were kept only as long as it took politicians in succeeding years to figure out that they could hold on to power by promising the most voters whatever the majority of the mob desired. Every other revolution replaced one regime of parasitic tyrants with another, often just as bad or even worse than those who were overthrown. While such revolutions were being fought, thou- sands of people who only wanted freedom died in support of a vain promise. Most revolutions didn't even promise freedom. Revolu- tionary leaders often want to take the wealth of the nation from those who had produced it and keep it among themselves. Look what happened to freedom when Lenin, Mao, Tito, Castro, Ho Chi Minh, Pol Pot, and Ayatollah Khomeini won their revolu- tions. The most recent example is Afghanistan, where the I Taliban helped win a victory over the Soviet Union, then , formed a repressive religious government that not only limited , freedom more severely than the Soviets ever did but gave sanc- I' tuary, protection, and support to a non-Afghani terrorist like Osama bin Laden."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":", 8 INVISIBLE RESISTANCE TO TYUNNY Invisibh Resistance to Tyranny Begins at Home What will people engaged in invisible resistance to tyranny do if our political leaders attempt to impose total tyranny? They will stay r&ht where they are. They will keep working at their jobs and taking care of their families. They will also continue to do exact- ly what they've done all along-resisting the tyranny in every pos- 1, sible way without letting the government or its enforcement offi- cers identifjr them as troublemakers. The invisible resister will I become the invisible freedom fighter. The object will not be just to resist government but to actively look for opportunities to interrupt the enforcement and population control operations of the tyrants and to make them fear the invisible freedom fighters as much as they are trying to make their subjects fear them. How Does an Invisible Resister Fight Tyranny? 1 i Ill mation, emotional support, safe houses, and assistance with escape and evasion, even if they are unaware that they are pro- viding such services. The most effective invisible freedom fighters will be in squad-sized units composed of five to eight individuals, all of whom will have known each other for a long time before decid- ing to go active. Such groups will engage in any operation only when all voluntarily agree on the details of the operation and the role each person will play. The purpose of this book is not to tell someone when to 1, The Basic Stratem choose to fight or how to fight but to convince the freedom lover 1 that he can fight without leaders giving orders, and that one should start getting ready for that possibility now. Subjects like sniper ~ operations and other uses of military force, personal defense, small- unit operations, and even esoteric topics like mantrapping are well ', covered in dozens of sources. Books and other publications on those subjects should be in the library of anyone committed to Never forget that invisible resistance to tyranny is not a strat- egy for taking over the government. Rather, it is a strategy for frustrating the efforts of tyrannical political leaders to the point where they lose the power to command and control the individ- ual behavior of citizens who wish to be left alone. The goal is to create situations in which it becomes obvious to those who believe the myths of government supremacy that political leaders have lost control of the citizenry to the point where they not only call no longer hlfill their dishonest promises but can't even guarantee domestic peace and order. Invisible resistance won't work for those who want a new socialist or hscist order, a racially pure society, a society where all join one brand of religion, a political order where animals are given more rights than humans, or where no one is permitted to cut down a tree. To impose such antifi-eedom political policies, some- one must take over government, either through revolution or the election process, then establish a new tyrannical rule. The only result will be the birth of a new invisible resistance movement. 11~ 1 Individual Tactics fighting for fieedom should the time ever arrive when that is the only choice except accepting a life of slavery. 1 ,I 1 One of the first issues an invisible resister has to address is whether he will continue to act as a single individual, unknown to anyone else, or if he will choose to operate in cooperation I with a small, leaderless unit of like-minded people. If he choos- es a cooperative form of action, the single most critical prepara- tion is to build the network of freedom lovers as described in Chapter 3 long before the time for fighting arrives. Even if an invisible resister chooses to operate alone, he will still want to have a network of trusted friends who can be tapped for infor- i The basic tactics of invisible resistance are for each individual to do the following:"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"INVISIBLE RESISTANCE TO TYRANNY SHOULD TOTAL TYRANNY COME Maximize one's own freedom, provide no support to the tyrant that can otherwise be evaded, and avoid the attention of the tyrant's enforcers at all times.

Assist those targeted by political enforcers to escape persecu- tion, prosecution, and imprisonment. Interfere in every way possible with the activities and morale of political leaders, their enforcers, and those who actively support government supremacists. The First Rule of Invisible Resistance Is Survival Life may not be worth very much if you are not free, but it is not worth anything if you are dead. In real life, dead heroes are failures. If we ever find it necessary to take up arms against tyrannical political leaders, we want to do it in ways that will maximize our own chances of living. Being able to do that is one of the beau- ties of invisible resistance to tyranny. Every resister will be mak- ing all the decisions about the risks he takes and will determine for himself the chances of his own survival. There will be no leader who is going to \"volunteer\" a freedom fighter into a sui- cide operation that makes the leader a success while leaving the \"volunteer\" dead. (Case in point: Patrick Henry, who uttered the famous phrase \"Give me liberty, or give me death,\" never fought on the battlefields of the American Revolution. He served as the first governor of Virginia while a lot of farmers, tradesmen, carpenters, and other ordinary citizens did the dying so that schoolchildren 200 years later could learn what a brave man Patrick Henry was.) In order to maximize impact while minimizing risks, there are a number of basic principles that every invisible resister must follow. By following these principles, each will maximize his impact on the tyranny while increasing the chances of staying around to enjoy the benefits. These principles are: Be well prepared before doing anything. Work within personal limitations and strengths. Never engage the enemy in a situation to the enemy's advan- tage. Protect invisibility at all times. Never engage in terrorism. I Get Prepared Before It Happens I The best way to prevent war is to prepare for war.

Never Engage the Tyrants in Situations \\ Where Thev Have the Advantage Peaceful confrontation can sometimes work while political leaders are still pretending to rule under constitutional law. Such ) 1' resistance never works in a totalitarian state. They only give the oppressor the name and the face of someone he wants to put behind barbed wire. Once someone has been identified as a potential troublemaker, he will be watched continually. From that \"I point on, the chances of that person doing anything effective for freedom without getting caught or killed are almost zero. To be an invisible resister, one must always appear to be the kind of person the enforcement agents of the tyrant would never 1, suspect of planning to foil the system. This means that anyone who wants to engage in invisible resistance should not join , protest groups, stand on street corners making speeches, or run with a mob throwing rocks at police vehicles. It's fine to encour- age others to do such things, but don't be the leader of the mob or even a participant. Instead, be the person who publishes a covert newsletter describing how the police massacred the pro- testers in the streets, then lied about it on the news. Above all, invisible resisters should always avoid engaging in an armed confkontation in which the agents of the tyrant initiate the action. Political tyrants love armed confrontations that they expect to win. They love pulling their guns and arresting peo- ple. They love putting down a riot with force. They love big trials of those who survive such an encounter, with some poor slob sentenced to life in prison or a date with a firing squad. These kinds of actions gives them a chance to show how pow- erful they can really be. Tyrants will expect open defiance, and they will be prepared to deal with it at the time and the place that they choose. When government enforcers initiate hostilities, they will always have more people, bigger and better guns, the tactical advantage, and usually surprise on their side. Even when those targeted for such action manage to fight back and inflict casual- ties on the tyrant's forces, they will lose the fight. They will probably all be killed, just like what happened in Waco, Texas. If there are survivors, they will end up spending long years behind bars-again, just like what happened with Waco. Some people talk about what armed citizen militias might do the next time the feds pull something like the attack on the Branch Davidian's home in Waco. The usual suggestion is that militia units should travel to the site and attempt to move in between those under attack and the federal thugs. The debate is over whether they should do so while armed or unarmed, not whether thev should do it at all. Doing i; either way plays right into the hands of the gov- ernment tyrants. They'll love the confrontation, and they will have more firepower than any group of citizens could possibly bring to the fight. Every individual participating in such an action will end up either dead or in jail. The media will be reporting the whole exercise as a victory for law and order over the nutty \"extren~ists.\" If invisible resisters decide to respond in some future situa- tion like that, the last place they want to head is where the tyrant's troops are concentrated. If they must do something, they should attack in places where the tyrant's forces are not expecting anything. (One can't help but wonder what would have happened in Waco if federal officers in a dozen different cities had suddenly come under personal attack while they tried to conduct the siege from afar.) Frankly though, the best way to proceed is to stay invisible and start spreading the word about how government thugs have once again mugged justice and"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"innocent American citizens for the sole purpose of demonstrat- ing who's boss. Protecting Invisibility Invisible resisters won't be holed up in well-armed com- pounds waiting for government troops to come for them. Instead, they will do everything possible to publically appear to be happy citizens, ready and willing to obey all the laws the tyrant imposes. The first principle of invisible resistance is to first make sure the forces of the tyrant don't have any idea who to go afier, then to hit the enemy where he doesn't expect it, when he doesn't expect it, and when he is most vulnerable to attack, then get away without leaving any trace or evidence. This doesn't mean that invisible resisters will never have to worry about the enforcers of the tyrant initiating a hostile ci lcG-G ii tcr. xvxvy*cii dlCS GC cGr, ii G\\\\-c-<Cr, pL \\\\.A! be dl< rKcAt of random investigations in which large numbers of innocent parties are questioned and subject to searches of their persons and properties in the hopes of discovering evidence leading to those engaged in antigovernment activities. Once elected political leaders become tyrants and drop all pretense of pretending to govern under constitutional law, the rules change dramatically. House-to-house searches, random stops to demand identification papers, and arrests on flimsy sus- picions followed by lengthy interrogations will be commonplace. Demanding one's rights will do no good because the enforcers will recognize no such rights. When that happens, the invisible resisters caught in the net will become the dumbest citizens in the country. If asked to explain why they didn't do something like file a required report, hand in personalIy owned guns, get a license of some kind, or prepare a report on their crop harvest, they will claim they didn't know it was required and promise to start doing so immediately. They will insist that they haven't been reading the newspapers, listening to radio, or watching television but that they love the government, enjoy doing their civic duty, and will certainly comply in the 1 Be an Invisible Resister, Never a Terrorist I I future. When asked a direct question, they will give as little infor- mation as possible and even lie if there is any possibility of getting away with it. They will never give any information that wasn't demanded, but they will act courteously, never suggesting by tone or attitude that they are being anything but totally cooperative. Playing ignorant in such confrontations ofien works because 1 tyrannical politicians and their enforcers start with an assumption 111 No matter how tyrannical a government is, it will always be 1 able to use acts of murder and terror to its own advantage. Therefore people fighting for freedom must never resort to ter- 1' rorism, no matter how desperate the military situation has become. If a freedom fighter finds it impossible to attack legiti- I mate military and political objectives, the only choice is to retreat into invisibility and continue working on building strength and recruiting new supporters until such time as attacks can be made on legitimate targets. I Some citizens will want to go afier the bastards who took freedom away or who refuse to grant freedom to those they rule.

Others may not be doing anything to resist tyranny because of fear of retaliation. While they don't have the guts to do something about it themselves, they will be secretly cheering freedom fighters on as long as they don't get hurt in the process. The invisible freedom fighter wants people fearing the tyrannical thugs, not those trying to win freedom back. CHAPTER 8 THE MANY PATHS OF INVISIBLE RESISTANCE I TO TYRANNY I In a battle for freedom, each individual will have to decide where his talents, skills, and personal attributes can best be used to resist the political tyrants. In most situations, an individual or a small group of friends will concentrate their energies on one of the following specialties: Intelligence collection and dissemination: This includes every- thing from gathering information through observation and radio frequency monitoring to running a ring of spies work- ing inside political action groups, administrative and law enforcement agencies, or the enemy's military structure. Those engaged in such activities must not only develop ways of gathering the information but means of disseminating it to others who can use it for tactical and strategic purposes. The intelligence can be used to inform the general pub-"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"INVISIBLE I(ESISTANCE TO TYRANNY THE MANY PATHS OF INVISIBLE RESISTANCE TO TYRANNY lic about the true intentions of the tyrants and their secret plans for political control as well as their corrupt behavior, illegal acts, wasteful use of public funds, and personal foibles. It can also provide target intelligence for operations designed to impede and frustrate the tyrant's schemes for the suppres- sion of opposition and total control. - - Operating communication, news, and propaganda systems: The importance of communication when fighting tyrants is won- derfully demonstrated in the movie The Postman, in which one man creates a postal system for villages under the control of a tyrannical warlord so that citizens can send personal letters to each other. Tyrants hate communications and news systems they don't control and can't censor or monitor. Invisible resisters will need to have ways to communicate with others in their fieedom networks and to spread the news of successful operations against the enemy. How this works will depend on the situation. If the tele- phone system is still operating and people still have personal computers, those wanting to engage in covert communica- tions will have a relatively easy task. In a more extreme situ- ation, news of victories will have to be spread by word of mouth and through the use of covert publications. Good propaganda will also explain to the general public why they have nothing to fear from invisible resistance and active insurgent units. Operating escape and evasion ystems: We already have situa- tions in the United States where people escaping prosecution for breaking unconstitutional laws must hid help in relocat- ing to a different part of the country with a new identity. There will be an immediate and critical need for such services if we ever experience a situation in which we must start fight- ing for freedom. Maintaining safe houses: Every type of underground resis- tance activity requires safe houses that can be used by those engaged in intelligence collection, helping those fleeing prosecution, or active operations. A safe house is any place that appears to be occupied by law-abiding citizens who would never engage in any kind of antigovernment activity. All invisible resisters should follow the security practices associated with establishing a safe house in order to increase their own chances of remaining invisible. '1 Sabotaar activities: This includes all actions aimed at dis- abling or destroying equipment, supplies, unoccupied build- ings, filing systems, training programs, and operations designed to restrict and control civilian populations. Antipersonnel actions: This includes everything from dirty tricks to, in the most extreme circumstances, targeted assas- sinations of specific personnel working on behalf of the tyrannical government whose duties and actions immediate- ly endanger the lives of innocent citizens. A single individual resister, acting alone, could handle several I or even all of these activities by himself. He might collect intelli- gence, plan and carry out operations based on that intelligence, ( and arrange for safe houses and escape routes as needed. In addi- tion, he may run a covert communication and propaganda system. He would, however, be an extremely rare and competent individ- ual as well as a natural loner. Most people engaged in such dan- 1 gerous work will want some kind of support system, even if they 1 , do not share with others all information on actual operations. I) Those with freedom networks can work out informal arrange- ments in which some members of the net do the intelligence col- lection while others deliver messages, provide safe houses, or carry out operations. In the most secure networks, no one will have any idea what everyone else in the net is doing in any detail. The sharing of information will be on a strict need-to-know basis. II Invisible Resistance Propaganda ~1 Tyrants must keep the population believing in the myths,"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"lies, false promises, and frauds they use to grab and hold power. Therefore, they do everything possible to ensure that their subjects never read, see, or hear anything that challenges their own propaganda. Tyrants don't want their subjects to learn about any resis- tance or opposition to their regime. They want every person to believe that the cause of fieedom is a lost cause because no one else is willing to do anything to get it back. Their propaganda machines only tell about actions in which their enforcers used superior force to squash those who threatened their rule. The controlled media will paint the resistance in such events in the blackest terms, labeling resisters as racist terrorists, antigovern- ment fascists, or other despicable epitaphs. Invisible resisters will want to spread the truth about the tyrannical leaders in every possible way. They will want to dis- seminate news stories that demonstrate the incompetence of the government in solving the problems of the people. Even more important, they will want the general population to know that someone is out there fighting back and that the tyrant's thugs have no idea who it is. Spreading covert propaganda is an activity that almost any- one can take up. It doesn't require an understanding of special- ized subjects like mechanics, firearms, martial arts, or espionage. All one needs is a reasonably active mind, a good helping of guts, and a few materials found in any office or household. Not only that, there are almost no physical limitations. Even Aunt Rhoda in her wheelchair can wage information war. Yet spreading pro- paganda may be the single most important action any invisible resister can undertake. Anyone can write an anonymous news announcement, make some copies, then leave the copies lying around where they can be found and read by others. The publisher of such documents won't worry that one of the copies will fill into the wrong hands. He wants the government to know somebody is fighting back, just not who it is. I In this day and age, starting a clandestine one-man freedom I newspaper is easy. With the proliferation of small home comput- ers and ink jet printers, thousands of people around the country already have all the materials they need to start publishing imme- diately. In fact, privately owned information machines like com- 4 puters represent such a threat to any potential tyrant that a total- itarian government will try to confiscate (or at least control) them once personally owned firearms have been collected. Of course, those with an invisible resistance to tyranny mentality will not give up their guns or their computers and printers. Even if a resister has nothing more than a yellow legal pad and a marking pen, he can distribute copies of his efforts at becoming the Tom Paine of the Second American Revolution. By writing in block letters and using a straightedge as a guide, one can produce a document for which no expert could posi- tively identify the author through handwriting analysis. Copies can be discretely left lying where people can find them. They can be tossed on empty bus seats and park benches, on top of counters in post offices and other public buildings, and even in toilet stalls. Copies can be put into envelopes and lefi lying on the ground in public places. Most people won't pick up a piece of paper, but they will pick up an envelope and, if it is open, read what is inside. Of course any freedom-oriented pro- paganda publication should include a short statement encourag- ing the reader to make his own copies and distribute them. The envelope can even be part of the propaganda. If the publication reports on government malfeasance, one can make it and the envelope appear to be official government paperwork. It might even be in the form of a memo from one well-known gov- ernment lackey to another. The invisible resister shouldn't worry about how kw people may read the prose. HopeUy, there could be hundreds of other people out there doing the same propaganda work. The amount of secret fieedom propaganda circulated is one of the ways each propagandist can get some idea of how many others are fighting alongside."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Keep It a Secret, but Advertise That's not a contradiction in terms. While the invisible resister won't want the enforcers to know who he is, he does want them to know what he did and why he did it. When some- one carries out a successful resistance operation, he should brag about it in his propaganda output. He will want both the tyran- nical system and the citizens to know why the radio station went off the air, why the air conditioner in the headquarters building didn't work yesterday, or why the provisional governor who was appointed to replace the recently imprisoned elected governor is no longer among the living. In covertly bragging about what they have done, resisters should make sure that there is nothing in the propaganda that could be used to discover their identity. One way to hide one's identity is to claim to be the representative of an underground organization or an outlawed political group. If the news I announcement includes information that only the perpetrators could know, and if there are several successive news releases on dif- ferent operations that provide the same kind of information, the enforcers will start looking for the imaginary organized resistance. The best kind of propaganda is that which is based on good intelligence resources inside the government. There are, afterall, very good reasons why all political leaders hate leaks with a passion. Suppose, for example, that an invisible resister who is work- ing as a secretary in a government office overhears two senior bureaucrats talking about how several gull owners in a rural area 1 attacked and killed federal enforcement officers trying to seize their firearms, then escaped. The government has censored the story in the controlled press, which brags about how well vol- untary compliance with total gun control is working. The secre- tary surreptitiously passes the information to a contact in her freedom network. That contact passes it to another contact, who publishes a covert news sheet, the next edition of which includes a story about the incident. A propaganda publication can even take credit where it was- n't earned. Say, for example, a high-ranking member of the gov- ernment drives his car off a cliff, killing himself and the young I woman who had her head in his lap when he crashed through ' the guardrail. While the controlled media report the event as a 1 tragic accident without even mentioning the woman passenger, a resistance newsletter gets the complete story out along with the name of the woman. Even better would be a report claiming I that government enforcers arranged a fital accident because the dead official was going to expose the frauds of political leaders. If a military plane crashes on landing, a resistance publicist can tell his readers it wasn't an accident but the work of the under- ground resistance or, again, the government itself trying to snuff out a coup led by a group of soldiers who had become fed up with the current political system. Invisible resisters will not want to claim credit for any event in which an ordinary citizen is injured or killed. Instead they will lay responsibility for all such tragedies on government personnel. Did the fuel tank on Flight 800 really blow up because of frayed electric wires, or are the stories of a U.S. Navy missile gone astray true? The invisible resister would always choose to propagate the latter explanation. The opportunities for a clever person with a flair for writing are endless. Propaganda alone won't force them to give your freedom back, but it is the catalyst that can make fighting for freedom work more effectively. Black Propaganda Black propaganda is the act of spreading lies, rumors, and false or exaggerated stories about an enemy by word of mouth, anonymous publications, or information plants. Well-done black propaganda makes the enemy look even more evil, cruel, venal, dangerous, and despicable than the truth would tell. The idea is to plant a story with strangers in the hope that they will pass the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"story on. Often, all it takes is a bit of deception with a stranger and a clever lie just close enough to the truth to sound plausible. The opportunity to spread this kind of propaganda can be found at every occasion in which an invisible resister deals with strangers whom he is not likely to see again. The target may be the person sitting in the next seat on an air- plane, someone standing in a movie ticket line in fi-ont of the invis- ible resister, or the guy on the neighboring barstool. Anytime an invisible resister travels or just goes out on a shopping trip or to look for an evening's entertainment is a good time to take advan- tage of such opportunities. If it's a situation in which self-introductions are made, the black propagandist should use a false identity that lends support to the rumor he intends to plant. He might claim to be a gov- ernment employee, perhaps even working for an intelligence or enforcement agency. During the course of the conversation he can drop a few choice bits of gossip supposedly collected during his day at work. The stories can range from a claim that the vice president and daughter of a senator are having an affair to a secret report that a major forest fire in a western state was caused by a military experiment gone wrong. One clever ruse is to use a phone that cannot be directly tied to the resister. He then can call a dozen or more numbers, either randomly chosen out of the telephone book or deliberately picked because the recipients are likely to act on the information. One way to do this is to make it appear as if a dialing mistake has been made while calling a local politician, police officer, or a political supporter of the tyrant. The ruse is to pretend that you have a critical piece of infor- mation for someone but have dialed a wrong number. As soon as someone answers the phone, the caller blurts out a message and begins to elaborate before he discovers it's a \"wrong\" num- ber. Here are a few possible examples: \"Tell the boss that rebels just attacked a police patrol unit THE MANY PATHS OF INVISIBLE RESISTANCE TO TYRANNY and killed them all. We've got to decide on a cover story.\" \"Tell the mayor his mistress is about to go public about the payoffi.\" I \"We've got a verified report that Flight 601 was shot down by one of our own missiles.\" \"All has been discovered. I'm leaving town. I suggest you do the same.\" At some point, the person on the other end will interrupt and say the caller has dialed the wrong number. Before hanging up, the caller then threatens the recipient with dire consequences if he should mention the call to anyone else. Think about the rumors and gossips that have become national myths-the grassy knoll in Dallas, the Kennedy involve- ment in the death of Marilyn Monroe, the different theories about the death of Vince Foster, the shots fired by the FBI at the Koresh compound, the surface-to-air missile that shot down Flight 800. We have already reached the point where most Americans no longer trust anything politicians tell them, and righthlly so. It's a perfect climate for the black propaganda rumormonger to wage war against unjust political leaders as they move hrther toward tyranny. I Picking Targets for Action I Whether the intent is to gather intelligence, wage a propa- ganda war, or engage in direct action, one has to first pick a tar- get. Instead of confronting the problem as part of an organiza- tion, an invisible resister deals with the enemy one on one. Therefore, the effective invisible resister picks targets based on proximity. He won't travel across the country to find someone to spy on or harass. Targets are found as close to home as possible. Each invisible resister picks his own targets based on opportuni- ty, potential impact on enemy operations, and chances for making a I successhl escape. Targets can be found among any of the following:"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"INVISIBLE RESISTANCE TO TYRANNY Political leaders and all members of their immediate staff. These are the primary villains, those who benefit most from our loss of individual freedom. Leaders of antifreedom special interest groups who actively collaborate with the oppressor. These are people who prop up the tyrannical political leaders with their support. Military personnel engaged in the suppression of political dissidents or who are fighting guerrilla bands of openly committed freedom fighters. The priority targets are the offi- cers, then the noncommissioned officers. Because every totalitarian state imposes a military draft, most of the grunts will be in the army by force, not by choice. Rather than tar- geting them, it's better to encourage them to turn into invis- ible resisters on their own. Members of police and law enforcement organizations engaged in political repression and persecution. Civilian government employees engaged in the repression of basic freedoms. This may include government censors, offi- cials charged with recruiting slave or forced labor, those administering farm and industrial collectivization programs, tax collectors, forced housing authorities, or population relo- cation agents. Known collaborators-ordinary citizens who are cooperat- ing with the oppressors by spying on their neighbors or employers, reporting on the movements of dissident groups, serving on committees that make forced labor assignments, and so on. Foreign occupation troops-yes, we may see the day when United Nations troops walk the streets of America. While I officers rank highest, all members of any foreign military force stationed in the country to help a tyrannical govern- ment suppress the general population would be fair game. Their presence is an open declaration of war against every advocate of individual freedom. Who Will Not Be Targets Because the object is to make war against a tyrannical gov- ernment and not to engage in any activity that could be con- strued as terrorism, invisible resistance operations must not target, injure, nor even seriously inconvenience anybody in any of the following groups. The general population and all ordinary citizens. These are all potential allies. Hopefully, many of them will be engaged in their own invisible resistance campaigns. Civilian government employees working in agencies that provide popular benefits to the general population. Included here are medical personnel, firefighters, garbage collectors, health and sanitation officials, and so on. (Many of these ser- vices would be better served by private enterprise, but cor- recting such abuses should be left until after the termination of the more destructive forms of tyranny,) Policemen engaged in protecting the public from violent crimes. The exception here would be corrupt policemen who shake down small businessmen, using their position to wring special favors out of the general public or who themselves commit violent crimes under cover of the badge. Target Recognition It's not enough to identifjr whom the target should be. The invisible resister must be able to identifjr the target on sight. Most Americans wouldn't recognize their own congressman, state senator, local police chief, or even the governor if they ran into any one of them on a beach or in a crowded supermarket. It's easy to tell who they are when they're wearing a uniform or standing on a podium, but that's not when a participant in the tyranny is most vulnerable. If possible, the invisible resister should catch the target alone and in his skivvies, so to speak. The resister will have to know what the target looks like and what his habits are in order to do that."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"INVISIBLE RESISTANCE TO TYRANNY Some years ago, I talked with a man who had just been appointed by the president to a controversial position in the gov- ernment. News of the appointment along with the man's photo was in all the newspapers. I asked him if he was worried about his personal security because of the new job. He told me he had been interviewed by Barbara Walters for a half-hour on morning television a few days earlier. Later that I same day he spent over an hour strolling along the streets of New York. Not once did anybody give him a second glance. Up until then, he had been worried about his personal security and was considering asking for Secret Service protection. After his stroll he decided he would stop worrying, at least until people started recognizing him on the street. This was not an ordinary- looking man either. He was tall and overweight and had a large, ugly face not easily forgotten. Invisible resisters will want to learn everything possible ~ about the people who are potential targets of their efforts. This includes not just names and pictures but where they work, what i kind of cars they use, and what they do for recreation. Most of them are a vain lot, so they like to have their faces on TV and their pictures in the local propaganda rag. Invisible resisters 1 should study those sources like star-struck teenagers who pore over movie magazines. Those considering operations shouldn't just rely on the media for information on target identity. Part of the intelligence gathering should include going to parades, public events, and open meetings. The invisible resister will be part of the crowd cheering the bastards, but he will be there to study the faces of the people standing on the review stand or sitting at the fi-ont table. There is a lot of luck in invisible freedom fighting, but luck isn't worth a damn if a resister doesn't recognize the man who just came into the restaurant as the agent in charge of the local ATF office that just raided and trashed a law-abiding gunshop, or the judge who sentenced a local businessman caught carrying a concealed weapon to a long prison term. Obviously, the chances for any invisible resister identifying a target and then getting into position to take action on that tar- get will depend on such things as geographic location, access to government personnel, and opportunity. It may come down to how a resister makes his living."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 OPERATIONS AGAINST TARGETS Many, probably most, invisible resisters will never have the opportunity to engage the enemy on a one-to-one basis because they will never get close enough to a valid target to engage him. The higher up the power chain an agent of tyranny is located, the more remote he will be from the citizenry. Therefore, even in the worst tyrannies, most invisible resisters will still have to focus their efforts on intelligence, communication, education, propaganda, and escape and evasion services. Who Can Engage in Direct Operations) I The invisible resisters most likely to find opportunities for more direct action are those who work in occupations that put them in direct contact with the officials of the tyranny. A num-"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"ber of occupations and professions offer unique opportunities for inflicting damage on the tyrant's system of political control through direct access. These include the following: Draftes in the National Army Every totalitarian government in the world uses involuntary \\ conscription to man its army. No single occupation offers more I opportunities for invisible resistance than that of the enlisted sol- dier. One of the great mysteries of humanity is why every totali- tarian army in history hasn't ground to a halt as the draftee can- / non fodder, under cover of battle, murdered the men who stole their fieedom and put their lives at risk. I suppose that's why they only draft the very young-they're the only ones dumb enough to be molded into obedient troops by propaganda and military discipline. People Impressed into Forced Labor Details Sooner or later, every totalitarian government resorts to invol- untary forced labor to get something (or everything) done. The idea of doing a job on the cheap by using unpaid labor is so appeal- ing to politicians that we already hear proposals for forced labor programs in the United States. Of course, the politicians don't call it forced labor; they call it \"national service\" or \"community ser- vice.\" Like all ideas designed to destroy personal fieedom, the fiee- dom takers claim it is good for the country and for the millions of I young people forced to give up their fieedom for a two-year stint in a public workforce or some other insanity like requiring so many hours of community service fi-om those already forced to spend I' their days in government indoctrinatioil facilities. Frankly, the fact that any government can get away with forced labor is a sad comment on the human race. One would think that a man who was chained to a workbench or forced I under guard to dig ditches, shovel shit, and clean toilets would be constantly trying to sabotage the work he was doing. Yet Hitler used slave labor in weapons factories, and southern plan- I tation owners ordered slaves to fix the master's meals. (We can only assume there was a lot of slave spit and urine mixed in with the food.) Let's hope that Americans have learned to love free- dom enough that they will never willingly cooperate when forced to work as slave labor. A forced laborer doesn't want to confront the man with the whip or the gun. But when that bastard isn't looking, then the fun can begin. An invisible resister will goldbrick, of course, but he will also be constantly on the lookout for chances to do real damage. He can break tools but make it look accidental; lose anything that can be dropped, hidden, or misplaced; waste everything from paper to fuel; and throw dirt into machinery. The more an invisible resister smiles and says \"yes sir\" when the boss is looking, the better the chances to screw things up when the boss turns away. Sabotage like this is the medicine that relieves the pain of slavery. Government Workers Someone working for government who learns to love free- dom along the way shouldn't quit his government job just because he realizes the country is no longer free. A government worker has a unique opportunity to disrupt and interfere with the efforts of the totalitarian state. Clerical and office workers can lose files, leak classified information, waste and mismanage supplies, spread misinformation, slow the work pace, and screw up damn near everything their ponlpous, authoritarian bosses are trying to do. At best, bureaucrats tend to be sloppy and incompetent. Imagine what they would be if they were trying to foul up the daily work of government. Maintenance and service employees will be able to sabotage vehicles and buildings, destroy government property, and dis- rupt communications equipment. Cleaning people, janitors, grounds keepers, and others working around and in government buildings will all have repeated chances to take action against members of the target groups as well as their workplaces."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The government employee who is also an invisible resister should always be looking for opportunities to help the poor ordinary bastard who is forced to deal with the government. Depending on the position he holds and the authority that goes with it, a government employee may be able to frustrate some of the things his office is trying to do to innocent citizens. I knew one friend who was drafted into the U.S. Army back in the 1960s, then assigned as a clerk in the provost marshal's office. He soon discovered that there was one officer who, when assigned defense counsel duties, actually tried to help grunts fac- ing court martial. My friend made it a point to shuffle papers around to make sure that enlisted men he thought were getting the shaft from the system got the sympathetic officer assigned to their case. My friend didn't last long as a legal clerk, but in the time he held the job a couple of draftees didn't end up serving the undeserved time in the stockade they would have without a bit of invisible help. Government employees, no matter how far down in the pecking order, learn a lot about waste, mismanagement, and incompetence in government. They see it all the time. They also quickly learn that there is no future for serious whistleblowers who go public. Even in our relatively free society, the most important government secrets are those hiding incompetence and criminal conduct by politicians and bureaucrats. If it is bad now, you can imagine what it will be like in an extreme totalitarian society. The tyrants and lackeys are not only going to be wasting the taxpayers' money, they are going to be laying plans for all sorts of nasty things for the citizens-forced labor, land confiscation, population reallocations, and reeduca- tion centers. The quicker that people learn what is going on, the sooner they can join the fight to make sure it doesn't get worse. All government workers learn about things that their bosses want to keep secret from the citizens. If such employees are committed to freedom, they will expose the secrecy but keep their own identities hidden. Of course, under a totalitarian dictator there won't be any Fox News or 60 Minutes to listen to the story a whistleblower wants to tell. The invisible resister will have to use covert propa- ganda techniques to get the story out. He can do more damage to the reigning tyrants that way than anything he could achieve by harassing or hurting some low-level bureaucrat. Recreation and Service Indzwtvies People are most vulnerable when they are off duty and hav- ing fun. Invisible resisters working as cooks, waiters, bellboys, hotel maids, golf pros and caddies, bartenders, and amusement park attendants will find that a high percentage of their customers are people in the target groups listed above. In fact, in a totali- tarian state the target groups are the only ones with the money and the opportunity to have a good time. (Many recreation spots may even be reserved for their exclusive use.) If an invisible resister is standing behind the bar, the tyrant's lackey buying the drinks could end up wishing he had never left the office. The opportunities available to prostitutes and other people providing illegal services shouldn't need much explanation. Moreover, some prostitutes may have a good reason for getting even. Many totalitarian governments (for example, the Japanese during World War 11) have forced local women into prostitution in the-countries they occupied or ruled. Unexpected Opportunities Any citizen who wants to be an invisible resister may find unexpected opportunities to get back at the bastards. A city apartment dweller discovers that the next-door neighbor is a member of the governing council appointed by the population conuol officer. A farmer finds that a local political leader and his friends are hunting on a nearby ridge. A man walking home late from work meets the mayor strolling back to his quarters with a brain full of booze. A young artist discovers that the pretty girl"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"in the fancy apartment next door is the mistress of a government agent in charge of enforcing gun confiscation laws and that he visits her without his security detail in tow. The fact is that any- one-gas station and parking lot attendants, grocery store clerks, delivery men, taxi drivers, and the termite exterminator--can find himself with a sudden opportunity to act. The more casual and unexpected such an opportunity, the \\ better the chance for achieving results and getting away with it. Each invisible resister must decide what he is personally willing and capable of doing in such situations-and then be on the I lookout for a target of opportunity. 1 What 'Ifrpe of Action to Take It is not necessary to kill someone in order to ruin his day. Indeed, it is much better to have a frustrated bureaucrat who can't figure out why things keep going wrong than having to deal with the dead man's replacement, who may be even more competent at spreading terror among the citizens. I Any action is welcome that makes it more difficult for a will- ing servant of a totalitarian leader to operate, even a practical joke. Ideas for practical jokes can range from clogging the toilets in a government building all the way to leaving fike plans for a I resistance meeting lying around where they can be found by law I enforcement authorities. A hotel maid can sprinkle a bit of itch- ing powder in the clean underwear of a hotel guest she knows is in the target group. Cockroaches can be released in an office. An irritating chemical can be slipped into the soap dispenser in a 1 government building. Such practical jokes can be very effective tools for disrupting the work of any government. I once saw one of the biggest U.S. embassies shut down and emptied for an fiemoon when an embassy guard accidentally exploded a tear gas grenade near an air-condition- ing intake. That was an accident (at least everyone assumed it was), I but it could have been done on purpose. On another occasion I watched a foreign government building evacuated when one of the employees discovered a briefcase sitting in a closet. It was locked and quite heavy, and something was tick- ing inside. Security personnel immediately emptied the building, and dozens of government employees stood around outside wait- ing for a bomb detection squad to arrive and examine the briefcase. When they finally opened it, they found several large rocks and an old alarm clock inside. It was a joke, but for two hours no bureau- crat in that building did any damage to the ordinary citizen. Practical jokes can be done by those who have no direct access to either the buildings or the personnel working in them. All it takes is a mysterious phone call or a letter with a vicious but plausible rumor sent to a boss. The anoilymous letter can do the most damage possible if it is well written, sounds plausible, and at least some of the information is true. Suppose an invisible resister in a public bar sees the director of the national tax authority one evening and he's had a couple too many. The invisible prankster for freedom writes an enforcement agency an unsigned letter and tells them about the occasion. She gives the actual time and date, the name and address of the bar, and describes what the man was wearing. Then she adds that she saw him accepting a large envelope from a local businessman. She claims that she overheard the tax man assure the businessman that he no longer had to worry about the tax audit of his business. So, even though the last bit isn't true, there's a good chance the enforcement agency will investigate it anyway. And the more time spent investigating themselves, the less time they will have to harass citizens. If It Ain't Broke, Break It Sabotage doesn't just mean blowing up bridges and destroy- ing railroad tracks. It can be as simple as shorting out the air con- ditioner in a headquarters building during high summer or"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"puncturing the tires of a senator while he's making a quick visit to his girlfriend. The resister's real problem is not finding something to sab- otage but making sure that he doesn't get caught doing it. For that reason, the best kind of sabotage is something with a delayed action. A janitor, plumber, or someone else who finds himself alone for a couple of minutes in a basement can jump- wire a fuse so it won't function when there is an overload. 1 Wiring can be deliberately frayed to cause a power outage, or a steam pressure valve can be clogged. Such mechanical time bombs can sit for weeks, even months, before they suddenly ruin the day for all the petty tyrants working in the building. Many people in the target groups will live in ordinary neigh- borhoods, where their quarters will be much more vulnerable to sabotage than their workplace. The tax auditor who spent the 1 night up with a flooded bathroom isn't going to be at his best in I the office the next morning. Moreover, he will probably never 1 guess that his problems were caused by a meter reader who dropped a sponge down a sewage pipe when no one was looking I or the gardener who pushed a water hose through a basement window and turned the water on. Automobiles are a saboteur's dream. They are left in parking lots, on streets, and in garages far from the safe storage and pro- ,, tection where their owners work. Oil pan nuts can be loosened, wires cut through or shorted, tires damaged, and all sorts of i nasty things put into the gas tank. A gas station attendant who services government vehicles can prepare a special can of oil by adding sand or any other abrasive material to the mix. The next time the internment camp director's limo needs a quart of oil, the special can is pulled off the back shelf where it sat waiting for an opportunity. Or a man pumping gas can keep an open bottle of Coke handy. If no one is looking, the drink goes in the tank along with the gas. The sugar in the Coke will be just as effec- tive as dry sugar from a cup. Files and information systems should be a primary target for any invisible resister employed in a government office. File clerks and secretaries, especially those working in offices where several different people do filing, can misplace or lose files. The secret is knowing enough about the mission of the office to be able to pick something really importai~t to lose. I've seen the work of an entire government office come to a complete halt for an hour while everybody looked for the file the boss demanded but that couldn't be found. Even when the file was found, the day was ruined for both the boss and his secretary. Nobody thought the file might have been lost on purpose. That is one of the great advantages of the invisible resister who stays on the job and lets people think he is just another dumb slob trying to do it right. Authoritarians like to think they are in such total control that they have the absolute loyalty of everyone who works for them. Therefore when things go wrong, it has to be incompetence, not something done deliberately. Computers offer a whole new world for sabotage activities. Those who understand computers and programming and have 1 access to one of the terminals in the office also have unbelievable power to lose files, screw up communications systems, discover office secrets, and wreak havoc in general. Someone with just minimal knowledge of computers can quickly type DEL * .*/SY at the DOS command and hit the enter key. Think what an invisible resister employed with the tax collec- tion authority could do with a minute alone with one of its main- frame control stations. Hundreds of returns could be lost and who knows how many taxpayers would be off the hook because everybody was busy trying to unravel the computer mess. The damage that can be done by somebody who knows computers is so tremendous that any invisible resister who has that kind of knowledge should restrict his actions to that single specialty. What a tragedy it would be if a person with such a potentially effective resistance tool was lost because he was 1 caught strangling an office director in a washroon~. There may be invisible resisters who will choose to engage in"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"more complicated sabotage operations that come closer to those normally associated with organized insurgent groups. Targets could irlclude such things as water, elecuical, communications, and sewage lines serving government installations. Power lines can be cut, water mains broken, transformers shorted out, and drainage conduits clogged. However, given the complexity of planning such attacks, such operations will most likely be carried out by small invisible resistance squads of cooperating individu- als rather than a single resister. The perpetrators of such attacks may choose to make the sabotage look like an accident. The less investigation there is, the more chance they will have of giving a repeat performance in another part of town. An example of a pretend accident is the use of a dead pigeon or crow to short out a transformer. Another possibility is to steal a car, preferably one belonging to someone in a target group, and run it into a telephone or electric pole hard enough to knock the pole down. The police investigating 1 the incident will think somebody stole the car, then accidentally rammed the pole. They will look for a car thief, not a freedom ~ fighter, and will therefore assign less priority to the case. Government warehouses make excellent targets for sabotage. While storage depots for weapons, ammunition, and other criti- cal items are so well guarded that any kind of attack may be too risky, even totalitarian governments need paper, fbrniture, offlce supplies, uniforms, and similar items that will be stored in places less well guarded. Ofien, such areas are especially vulnerable to small Molotov cocktails thrown over walls or through windows. (Just be certain there is no night watchman or janitor around who could get hurt in the resulting damage.) Radio and TV stations specializing in government propagan- da are excellent targets for sabotage. Transmitter sites are fre- I quendy located at some distance from the studio, ofien in 1 remote areas, making them vulnerable to sabotage attack by a single person. No invisible resister should ever consider such things as poi- soning city water supplies or blowing up bridges. Unless the sit- uation is absolutely desperate, there is a specific military objec- tive to be gained by such an action, and it can be done with no civilian casualties, those are acts of terrorism and are not only immoral but counterproductive to the cause."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"I CHAPTER 10 I DEADLY VIOLENCE- IS IT EVER NECESSARY? No person who loves freedom wants to deny any other human being the same freedom. Taking a life is the ultimate denial of freedom. Nevertheless, effective individual self-defense must include the possibility of inflicting lethal injury as the last resort in preventing serious injury or death from criminal attack, terrorism, or tyranny. Under truly dire circumstances, fighting for one's personal freedom is as much self-defense as protecting one's life. Government is basically a legal monopoly on the use of force. Every law is backed by the threat that those who break them will be confined, seriously injured, or killed. Constitutional govern- ment puts strict limits on when and how political leaders can use that force. When they ignore those limits and use their power for unconstitutional purposes, they become no better than the com- mon criminal. Anyone facing a loss of freedom in such a situa-"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"tion can claim the right of self-defense against those causing the loss of freedom. The Declaration of Independence is a powerful document that uses powerful words to build a moral justification for dead- ly resistance to tyranny. Even so, if the American rebels had lost the war, the British would have rounded up those who signed that document and executed them as criminals. No government, including our own, recognizes the Declaration of Independence as a legal justification for any act of rebellion. The winners always declare that the killings they did were legal, but any subsequent lethal force against them is illegal. But once again, the objective of invisible resistance to tyran- ny is not to win a war but to maximize each resister's own indi- vidual freedom. We don't want to take over government; we just want to stop it from denying us freedom. If we can do that by successfully hiding our acts of resistance from those who limit our freedom, by ignoring their laws, and by spreading dissent and a loss of faith in their lies, there will be no need to commit deadly violence. As we have seen, if enough citizens successfully respond to tyrannical government in those ways, it will eventu- ally collapse from its own weight. It is only when we find that we have no other way out of a situation that we should consider using deadly violence as a last resort. Before we consider an act of deadly violence against any politician or government employee, we must be in a situation in which our own lives or individual freedom are in immediate and deadly danger. There may come a day when tyrannical leaders and their agents, or even terrorists or a foreign occupying force, engage in imprisoning or killing innocent citizens. Very few, if any of us, face such a situation at this time. Even so, we ought to give seri- ous thought to how to proceed if we ever do find ourselves in such peril. I Whose Death Would Be Worth the Risk of Committing Deadly Violence) Wars are won by the side that most effectively kills those on the other side. Effectively is not, however, measured in numbers \\ but in the importance of those who die. While tens of millions of people died in World War 11, the war in Europe only ended when one man, Adolf Hider, died. The war with Japan didn't end because the emperor and his prime minister feared that atomic weapons would kill millions of Japanese soldiers and civil- ians. It ended because those two men feared that the next bomb dropped would kill them. As explained earlier, the only one who matters in a tyranny of one-man rule is the tyrant himself. Yet killing him is an extremely high-risk endeavor. The leaders of such governments are the most well-protected people in the world. The chances of the perpetrator surviving and escaping after a successful opera- tion are almost zero. When someone does successfi~lly kill such a tyrant and escapes with his life, the assassin is almost always someone close to the leader or a member of his personal bodyguard. Most of the time even those people fail in their efforts. Look how many times assassins have tried to get Saddam Hussein, failed, and paid the ultimate price for failure. The assassination of Hitler in the last years of the war in Europe would have brought the war to a quick close and prob- I ably saved tens of thousands of lives. There were German mili- tary officers close to Hitler who did try, but they failed and died for their failure. The war didn't end until Hider's only choice was capture by the Red Army or suicide. What's Different about a Mob Democracy Style of Tyranny? The mob democracy style of tyranny presents a different set"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"INVISIBLE RESISTANCE TO TYRANNY of problems. In governments where ruling tyrants can be changed through an election or parliamentary or bureaucratic process, the tyrant worries about his popularity with the voters, the legislators, and the bureaucracy. He must therefore be con- cerned about the safety and welfare of those who serve him, especially those who serve in the higher ranks. A situation in which significant numbers of high-ranking supporters of an elected tyrant start assuming room temperature for unexplained reasons could seriously threaten his hold on power or force him to move to one-man rule and full totalitarianism. There are almost no historical examples to help predict what may happen if significant numbers of resisters against mob tyran- ny started assassinating high-ranking government officials and get- ting away with it. The only example in the American experience were the rumors during the Vietnamese War of drafted soldiers fhgging incompetent officers duiing combat. While I know of no significant studies done on the frequency of such acts, there is some anecdotal evidence that morale among combat officers was seriously affected. The increasing frequency of suspicious injuries and deaths may have had some impact on the political decision to get out of the war as quickly as possible, regardless of the conse- quences for our Vietnamese allies. It certainly played a role in Dick Nixon's decision to stop sending draftees to Vietnam. Even if selective assassination in such a future situation proves to be a successful tactic, it will be a high-risk activity that should be considered only by desperate people who see no other alternative. The tyrants and their high-ranking lackeys won't like serving as living targets: tyrants are always willing to fight to the last drop of blood, as long as it's not their own. Nothing is given higher priority than the identification and cap- ture of anyone inflicting injury on an important government official. Moreover, a totalitarian government isn't going to be hampered by constitutional restrictions on searching private property, tapping phones, holding suspects without charge, or adhering to civilized interrogation techniques. Anyone who engages in violence against the participants of tyranny must be prepared to pay the consequences. Anyone caught carrying out deadly violence against any of the target groups in any totalitarian government will face execution. By 1 the time the authorities get around to inflicting that punish- ment, the captured perpetrator will be happy to die. Before death comes, his genitals will have been fried with electric wires, 1 , his mind scrambled with chemicals, and his body twisted and broken like a rat in a cage full of terriers. The inquisitors will stretch out the torture as long as possible, trying to get the per- petrator to tell who his contacts in the underground are, what rebel unit he belongs to, who the leader is, and who gave the I order for the operation. An invisible resister won't have any answers to such ques- tions, but the tyrant's enforcers will never accept his claim that he was acting along with no direction from any leader. This will be even more true if the perpetrator spread a little black propa- ganda before being captured, dropping leaflets and sending 1 / announcements to media sources claiming the operation was the work of some fictitious rebel group like the National Freedom 1 1 Militia or the Armed Sons of Liberty. He might even have I blamed the operation on an enemy of freedom who usually sup- , I ports the tyrant, like the Return to Nature Trust or the Anti- i ' Petroleum Coalition. The Futility of Attacking Low-Ranking Officials Among those who opt to follow the path of invisible resis- tance to tyranny, most will never have any opportunity to engage in deadly violence against any individual who really matters. Those who really matter are never in a location where an invisi- ble resister could get a clear shot or a chance to lace his coffee with poison. Once getting freedom back through nonviolent methods no longer seems like a viable option, there will be some who"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"will look for opportunities to direct deadly violence against low-level members of the target groups listed in the previous chapter. Those who take such actions will be motivated more by frustration than sound strategy. They will have little impact on the tyrants who rule even if their mission is successful. Those at the top of the tyranny will not care how many of the rank and file are killed, as long as their hold on power is maintained. Indeed, their propaganda machine will use the deaths of lower ranking personnel as a rallying cry to win stronger support from the citizenry, describing such acts as terrorism. Rather than engaging in ineffective killing, it is better for invisible resisters to continue to effectively educate those citizens they personally know about the evils of tyranny, even tyranny based on mob democracy. All the same, there may come a day when invisible resisters will have no choice but to use deadly violence against lower ranking personnel working for the tyrants. One possible situa- tion would be an attack against a political, military, or police official who is especially vicious and sadistic in enforcing the commands of the tyrant. A historical example is found in the assassination in 1942 of SS-Obergruppenfuhrer Reinhard Heydrich, Hider's appointed ruler in occupied Czechoslovakia and one of the chief architects of the Holocaust. With Allied help, four Czech patriots who had been living in exile in England parachuted into Czechoslovakia for that specific purpose. While the operation succeeded, all four of the assassins died in the aftermath. Worse than that tragedy, many Czech citizens suffered torture, imprisonment, and death as a result of the German search for the perpetrators and retalia- tions for the action. Heydrich was quickly replaced. There is no evidence that the assassination had any significant impact on the German war effort, nor did the Nazi treatment of the Czech population improve in any way. Indeed it turned even more cruel and sadistic. There is no reason to suppose that the result would be any I different in some similar future situation. Anyone committed to 1 trying such a desperate attack must devise a plan that avoids reprisals against innocent citizens. That usually requires making l it appear to be an accident, although it might also be possible to frame another agent of the tyranny with the crime. Spreading the News As pointed out above, most invisible resisters will not have the opportunity to engage in effective deadly violence even if they have the inclination to do so. However, if lethal resis- tance does commence in the face of brutal tyranny, every invisible resister can spread the word and explain why it is hap- pening, using every available method of news reporting and propaganda activity. We have seen how groups such as animal rightists and envi- ronmentalists exploit this propaganda technique. A spokesman for a public organization claims that his group does not endorse such violent behavior as the murder of a scientist engaging in animal research or the destruction of expensive logging equip- ment. But he then describes what the victim was doing that made him a target and hopes people will understand why some- one who loves animals or trees might be driven to such an act. Invisible resisters engaged in propaganda activities should take the same tack, insisting that they do not endorse the dead- ly violence aimed against lackeys of the tyrant, but then explain- ing why some people are driven to such desperate acts because of the loss of freedom. They should also express the fear that we can expect such acts to continue and to increase as long as oppressors enforce gull confiscation laws, ignore free speech rights, hold suspects without trial, and do all the other things that tyrants love to when they can get away with it."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 ORGANIZED RESISTANCE FORCES Should our political leaders ever succeed in imposing total tyranny on the American people or move so far in that direction that armed rebellion is justified, we can expect that an organized armed resistance of some kind will emerge. The numbers of weapons held in private hands in the United States almost guar- antees that. The popularity of the citizen militia movement after the incidents at Waco and Ruby Ridge also suggests it will hap- pen. Indeed there are reports from some sources that several underground groups are already preparing for such a future action against tyranny. There may even be several different kinds of partisan groups actively engaging the forces of tyranny at various levels of resis- tance. These groups may range in size from a small collection of people to a large partisan force spread over several states but under the control and guidance of a single leader. The political"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"motivations of such groups may be different and even contrary to each other. All such forces will be organized in some kind of quasi-military fashion, with a leader and subordinate ranks of officers. The top people will impose military-style discipline on their members. Invisible resisters, especially those who have built large free- dom networks and engaged in extensive educational activities in the time preceding the imposition of total tyranny, may have contacts with members of such groups. They lnay even be approached and recruited to serve in them. Such resistance groups will have a critical need for those who fit the mold of the invisible resister; that is, people who are vehemently opposed to the tyranny but who have not been identified as enemies of the state. Those are the kinds of people that every underground resistance organization must recruit to run safe houses, engage in intelligence collection, operate escape lines, carry messages and supplies through enemy-controlled territory, and perform other critical tasks. While services to organized insurgent groups may be one of the single most important things that invisible resisters can do to help defeat tyrants, individuals must take great care in deciding whether or not to cooperate with any such groups. Direct par- ticipation in activities that support such forces is as dangerous as engaging in deadly violence against the enemy personally. Indeed, it may be more dangerous because at least a few people in the underground organization will know the identity of the invisible resister who joins. As mentioned previously, all too often in history leaders of insurgent and revolutionary groups have had little interest in win- ning fieedom for the people. Instead, they have wanted only to replace the current tyrants with themselves as the new tyrants. Given the ideals of the American Revolution and our long experi- ence with constihltional government, one hopes that at least some of the leaders of any new organized insurgent group would have the same commitment to individual fieedom and constitutional government that invisible resisters will have. It will be up to each individual to make his own examination of the bona fides of the leadership of any organization trying to enlist him in its service, then make a decision based on the character of the leadership as to whether or not to get directly involved. Invisible resisters must not just consider the political philosophy of the leadership before enlist- ing in the cause but also the size of the organization, the strategic and tactical abilities of the leaders, and the chances of the organi- zation having a real impact on the fight for a return to fieedom. If an invisible resister is not approached or chooses not to accept an invitation to join an organized insurgent force and to instead fight back as an individual or as a member of a small, leaderless squad of resisters, he can still look for ways to com- plement the actions of organized partisan groups. If, for exam- ple, a large resistance group is actively operating in the same area where an invisible resister is located, he might find that he can serve the cause of freedom best by engaging in covert propa- ganda activities in support of the operations of the organized group even though he has no direct contact with the partisans. The most difficult situation that an invisible resister can face is one in which there is an organized rebel force led by a charis- matic leader who has no more interest in true freedom than the tyrants in power. Despite his rhetoric, the rebel leader uses pop- ular anger to enlist soldiers in his efforts to replace the reigning tyrants with his own form of tyranny. This is exactly what hap- pened during World War I1 in many parts of Europe and Asia. Many of the organized resistance groups in these places were communist. As a result, the freedom-loving citizens in the coun- tries of Eastern Europe and places like Korea, Burma, Vietnam, and China found themselves no better off after the defeat of Germany and Japan than they had been under fascist rule. These kinds of rebel organizations often used terrorism as part of their arsenal of tactics. This was demonstrated during the Vietnam War by the Viet Cong, who often murdered civilians rather than allow them to cooperate with the government and its U.S. ally."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"a x 0 .Y I 4 .$ $ -5 .5 -e 9P)e)P):a 2 gm\" 8 5 .E?

Invisible resistance to tyranny and terrorism can work if every one of us who loves freedom starts practicing it.

No group of terrorists can achieve its political goals if its targets are freedom-loving indi- viduals willing to take responsibility for their own defense and to pay any price to live or die as free men and women. Once enough citizens begin to demand freedom in ways that make it impossible for a tyrant to continue to govern and enforce unjust laws, there are several routes the tyrant can take as he gives up his power.

This is what happened at the close of the American Revolution- the British went home or north to Canada, and those who had been leading the rebellion established new governments in each of the thirteen colonies. While those who fought the American Revolution set out to establish a free nation, most other colonies in other parts of the world were not so lucky. In much of Latin America, Asia, and Africa, the new governments of former colonies quickly degen- erated into tyrannies as bad as or worse than those of the former colonial powers. When a tyrant starts a war with other countries in the hopes of gaining personal glory and more subjects and then loses the war, the victors sort it out. That happened at the close of World War 11. While the Americans, British, and French established constitutional democracies in Japan and Western Germany, citi- zens in East Germany, the Eastern European countries, and some of the former colonial countries of Asia were drowned in 50 years of communist tyranny after the defeat of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. One might argue that many citizens in those countries were even worse off than they had been under Nazi or colonial tyranny. Tyrants who don't read the future in time to escape into exile can find themselves captured by a rebel group and facing the wrath of justice. That happened to King Louis XVI in France who, with his wife, Marie Antoinette, ended up on the guillo- tine. Unfortunately, the tyrannical government that followed Louis sliced off thousands of more heads in an era still known as the Reign of Terror. In turn, that tyranny was followed by Napoleon, who was as bad as or worse than many of the kings who had ruled France. Tyrants who can read the future can pack up and run for a foreign country when the citizens take to the streets. They often live out their lives in exile while they enjoy the stolen wealth stashed in their Swiss bank accounts. This has been the most popular way for dictators in the Third World to give up power. Fulgencio Batista (Cuba), Anastasio Somoza (Nicaragua), Ferdinand Marcos (Philippines), \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier (Haiti), and Idi Anlin (Uganda) all took that route out of power, leaving their countries to the rebels in the hills or whoever could sit him- self in the presidential chair first. Almost always, the new man in the power chair was as bad a tyrant or worse than the man living in splendid exile. Fidel Castro is the best example of this. The sad truth is that most times when the citizens succeed in throwing out one tyrant, what they get as a replacement is not worth the suffering, sacrifice, and dying it cost to kick him out. Instead it is more of the same kind of self-serving leaders who care not a whit about anything but their own pleasure and power. Given this sad history, the goal of invisible resistance should not be to throw the bums out but to make the bums already holding office realize that the best way they can keep their jobs is to stop promising lies in exchange for freedom and to start doing what political leaders in the United States should have been doing all along-protecting the freedom of the citizens and nothing move than that. Politicians will defend freedom only for as long as we keep demanding freedom. When they discover that large numbers of potential voters are demanding freedom instead of political bribes, they will start giving bits of freedom back. They will sup- port tax cuts, freedom of choice in education, and an end to the wars on drugs, poverty, guns, tobacco, successful business entre- preneurs, and the health and pharmaceutical industries. The only hope we have of creating such a situation is by weaving our invis- ible nets of freedon1 one individual at a time until they explode in a chain reaction of dissent that forces our political parasites to become our servants of freedom.
