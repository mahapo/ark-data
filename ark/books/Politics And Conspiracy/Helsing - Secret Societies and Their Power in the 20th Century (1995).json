Truthbringers must come un der what protection they can gain for selves and we o we imm easurable ap preciation to those whose investigations lead them onward in spite o f the risks that research brings. The do cument speaks for itself, please. I prefer to leave the information as written and withou t further comment on same as to personages except to say that the copy we ha ve been p rovided is from Spain – ha ving traveled through translators and researchers in Germany, Switzerland and e ven b y way of Australia and those a forementioned UFO characters.

I repea t the WE HAVE NEVE R VA RIED ONE IOTA from our assigned task (mission), no matter how many might deviate from their “claimed” direction of intent. As for this book in po int, we would a sk a coup le of things, for this will be a “refresher” course in p repa ration for the next PHASE of the project und er way. 1) The bo ok is BA NN ED and we respect the da nger to the author(s).

When Satan stirs the pot, beware the brew! TO THE REA DER The life o f a pub lisher is really quite interesting. You are never safe from surprises. In 199 3 a young man who d id no t want to give h is name called me and said that he had just written a h ighly explosive boo k. He was now looking for a pub lisher, but he wanted to remain anon ymous. I said that would be OK and a sked h im to send me the manu script. Some da ys later a disk ette arrived in the mail, together with a sum of mone y. The parcel had n o send er’s address. There was a letter though that you will read o n the following pages. I printed the text immediately and read it with the greatest interest and withou t stopp ing. Upon finishing I was s hattered – and that even though I had alread y known a few things abou t the machinations of certain circles in ou r high society. Of course it was impossible to check all the correlations s hown in the bo ok for their validity, but if only a pa rt thereof is true, I now unde rstand why there is s o much suffering upon this planet, why most peop le are po or and all the wealth and po wer of this earth are in the hand s of a few unscrupu lous persons. Nobod y can pa ss by this book! Cordially y o urs , K.D. Ewert-Gamalo Tiozon [H: Following is the letter which would ha ve been a round 199 3 as stated. The bo ok itself was presented in 1995 . I offer this s o that you can unde rstand the more recent recognition of the bo ok itself.] Dear Mr. Ewert! Abou t a year ago I received from a friend a copy of your magazine “ Resolut” and I was s urprised to find so many books dea ling critically with d ifferent topics on one pub lisher’s list. I was impressed that you d ared to offer these bo oks as well as your own “free energy” developments s o open ly. From “ Resolut” I unde rstood that you were p repa red to pub lish first works as long a s they are convincing and that the author is prepared to share the cost as s tated. Therefore I send you on the en closed diskette the manu script “ Secret Societies and Their Power in the 20 th Century ”. You certainly will ask how I got hold of this information. Actually I stumbled upon the subject of “Secret Lodges and Politics” while researching something completely different. [H: Isn’t this the way of it?] As you certainly know, all matter, both in the microcosm and in the macrocosm is held together by electromagnetic forces. If I find a way to interfere with these electromagne tic forces and to alter them specifically, I can influen ce both matter and time. There are two ways to a chieve this: with machines, and withou t them. The machines to d o this are known a s s pace-time modu les and as anti-gravity flying disks, the so-called UFOs, that by their self-produ ced magnetic fields, can manoeu vre independen tly of the earth’s magnetic field (anti-gravitation). Other m achines that can tap into these electromagnetic fields and change them to usable en ergy are called “free en ergy devices” (e.g. tachyon converters, space quanta motors)."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"3 Peop l e who can a lter m atter by consciously rotating their “MERKABA ”, their own magnetic field, are called AVA TARS (the best known in the Western World was c alled Yeshua ben Joseph , Jesus, who was a master amongst them). It is thus possible to create directly from the ethers (m aterialization), to e liminate gravity, to float or to walk on water (levitation), to d isplace on eself instantaneo usly, for instance, from Africa to America (telepo rtation), spon taneou s hea ling b y changing the structure o f the cells, etc. I had the advantage of having been raised spiritually. Thus, I learned early on to consciously program by subconscious, to live following the un iversal laws and to train my mediumship. According to the law of resonan ce I then started to attract similar peop le to me. I am now 27 years old, have traveled five continen ts, and ha ve found the mentione d machines as well as avatars in a lmost every coun try. In New Zealand I encoun tered several peop le that had emigrated there precisely because in Europe they had met with severe difficulties from the nu clear, oil and e lectricity lobb ies because they were de veloping free ene rgy devices or anti-gravity flying disks. I started to ask just why we ne ver hea r abou t these techno logies and why the Churches are presenting the works of avatars as miracles. Why are h uman be ings like Jesus and Buddh a elevated to b e Sons of G od a lthough their deed s are merely the app lication of definite laws of Nature that are at the d isposal of everyone on this plane t? So I slowly discove red who and what was beh ind the fact that these themes never appea r in the media or are ridiculed and why pub lications are fraught with the utmost disregard to h uman lives. That this topic is not just a game became terribly clear to me when an a cquaintance, a ranger in the north o f the New Zealand South Island ha d discovered a testing ground for flying saucers of the U.S. Air Force and was found on ly five hou r after he had annou nced h is find at the foot of a cliff, murdered together with h is only witness. I met CIA, Naval Intelligence and BND (Bunde rnarchrichtend ienst of G ermany) members that were o r still are involved in such p rojects. Many of them didn’t want to continue in this dead ly game, but they fear for their lives – surely justifiably so – if they revealed inform ation. Inform ation like this and other “secrets” that I stumbled upo n during my research ha ve bee n collected in this book. All of it is interlinked with secret societies, religion, high finan ce and po litics. Now I am torn between the terrible he lplessness that I feel along with the rest of my generation an d that drives s o many into a feeling of NO FUTUR E, and the d efiant drive to coun ter this madne ss in a refreshing, unaffected and unb iased way, with a wakening might, with the well-known spiritual laws and spiritual knowledge. As pub lisher and author, we have to a waken, to stir up, but the changes have to b e wrought by toda y’s youn g g ene ration of this bogged down hu manity on o ur m altreated Mother Earth. As I have been repe atedly and very seriously warned a gainst persona lly stand ing up to these established po wers, I am send ing the manu script withou t sende r’s add ress in the hope that you will be e qually convinced o f its c ontent and will pub lish it unde r the pseudon ym given. Unde r the circumstances I would a lso be p repared to waive an y remuneration – in the interest of the cause. I wish this book diffusion and success unde r the caring b lessings of the p ositive spiritual forces!

It is y our m ission to reconno iter this planet, to establish contact with its inhab itants to e xchange inform ation an d knowledge of any kind. If this proves positive and you a re convinced of the sincerity and pea cefulness of the peop le, Earth could be accepted into the Intergalactic Fede ration. Then it would be po ssible to ha ve open contacts with inhab itants of other plane ts which would cause a rapid de velopment of the e arthlings’ consciousness and in their techno logy and hea lth service. After entering orbit you switch on your monitor to receive e ventual signals. You get a news s tation reporting on what’s happen ing on Earth. Thus y ou recognize that this is a warring plane t where for thou sand s of years peop le fought, maimed and killed, not, as y ou would a t first assume, enemy plane ts, but EA CH OTHER. You soon realize that there is no concept beh in d these wars, because some fight for their religion, others because of the color of their skin. There are some who a re un satisfied with the size of their coun try and o thers fight just to survive, as they have no food. Some have on ly finan cial gain in mind, but on the whole, everyone is mainly concerned abo ut himself. You realize that this plane t is not at all read y for the information and the techno logy that you ha ve to offer. No matter which coun try y ou would choo se to land in, your gifts would certainly not be used for the good o f everyone on Earth, but again just for the selfish interests of those lead ing that country. Perhap s you will think back to your home p lanet and the time that there were still wars there. But since this has been o vercome thou sand s of years ago and you ha ve no inclination to relive that scenario, and since you found that a few “m issiles” had been fired in the d irection of your space cruiser, you quickly decide you’d rather go visit ano ther plane t. Have you ever wonde red why pe ople a re a lways warring upo n each other? The Swiss sc ientist Jean -Jacques Babe l foun d that during the 5,600 years humanity fought 14,500 wars with three and a half billion dead . That is half of toda y’s world popu lation. In the 1991 , for example, there were 5 2 wars or warlike crises upo n Earth. This mean s that in the very y ear, after coun tless wars and clashes on this planet, among them two world wars in just one century, there are 104 oppo sing ideo logies facing ea ch other, with concerns that appa rently weigh hea vily enou gh to justify the killing of further m illions of human be ings. What purpose could b e served b y war among them? For centuries, pea ce organizations and philosophe rs alike ha ve deliberated abou t this and foun d that almost all human beings upo n Earth fight from time to time o ver territory and food. But aggressive beha vior among an imals canno t be compared d irectly with the beha vior of human be ings because the latter also have intelligence, consciousness and ethics. Just think of the difference between two p reda tors fighting over the prey and multinationa l arms companies living off t he sale o f weapon s and therefore o ff permane nt war. That the “fight for survival” can a lso be a source of entertainment is known from ancient Rome, when unde r the motto “pane m et circenes” ( bread and circus games) gladiators had to fight on ano ther to de light the plebe s and to distract them from their own powerlessness. The same principle toda y app lies to televisions, video s and mass s ports like football, which a re all used to enab le the supe rficial citizens to e scape from the opp ressive void o f their existence. What are the media diverting from?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"5 What could man p erhap s find o ut of realize if he wasn’t constantly diverted? It is well known that a third p arty is usually gaining from the conflict of two o thers. If we en large this thought for persons to coun tries of to the whole p lane t, then we will still find it valid. Banking systems, for example, that had loaned mone y to a warring nation ha ve a vested interest in seeing the war drag on . Wars and u nrest can also convince a peop le to accept the setting up of institutions, and to even welcome them, that und er norm al circumstances, it would ne ver have a ccepted (e.g. NATO, UN). On the whole, though, those not es pecially interested, excepting the dead , will find no link between the wars of the last centuries. Could it be that wars ben efit other besides the arms indu stry? What is it that prompts peop le a gain and again to hate to such an e xtent that they are read y to kill their own species for it? What can b e so important to extinguish other lives for? Has nothing been learned from the millions and b illions that have a lread y died in the wars, and from the pain thus indu ced? In Yugoslavia, for instance, several p eop les had been living together pea cefully for many decade s just to slaughter each other now. What is it in these peop le that their brothers who lived in the same village, speak the same language, look s imilar, wear the same clothes, who love and en joy, laugh an d cry just as they do, are sudden ly their bitterest ene mies, so they slaughter their children, rape their wives and mothers, put the men into concentration camps... Don’t we know this from somewhere a lread y? Have really ideo logical reasons of certai n g roup s led to these wars, or m ight there b e somebod y else pu lling strings in the wings? Who could that third p arty be? Where doe s that concept of the ene my originate that we a re fed by religions, schoo lboo ks and the mass media? What are the aims of th ose who en gend er these concepts of the ene my and have them constantly suggested to u s? Who would p rofit most from the rising hatred and the degene ration of humanity? Perhap s it is to Satan, Lucifer, Ariman, Baph omet or other intangible en tities that one would like to pa ss the b lame? Perhap s. In this book, the story of some very tangible peop le is told, who in 1773 , in a hou se in the Juden strasse (Jew’s s treet) in Frankfurt, planne d to pave the way for a, “One World Government” by the year 2000 with three world wars, a perfectly worked out plan u sing the fears and weaknesses of the peop le against them. To aim for a world government is nothing new, even toda y the Vatican wants to make this world a catholic one. And h istory shows that to this end it let millions of peop le b e tortured and killed. Islam has the same objective, and toda y has the best chan ces to achieve it as Islam is now the largest and also most fana tical religion. The “pan-Slavic” ideo logy of Russia, originally v oiced by William the Great, asking for the e limination of G erm any and Austria in o rder to take India and Persia after having subjugated Europe, is ano ther along those lines. A further ideo logy to b e mentioned is the one a sking for a confederation o f Asian stated unde r Japa n with the motto “Asia to the Asians”. Last, but not least, there is the “pan -Germ anic” ideo logy plann ing a control of Europe by Germany, later to b e extended to the whole world. Yet the persons mentioned in this book are independen t of any creed and do not belong to an y nation. They are neither “rightist” nor “leftist” nor “liberal” but they use ALL institutions for their objectives. They are members of one organization o r another, but just to"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"6 hinde r any research, to confuse the “curious” and put them on the wrong track. They use Christians and Jews, fascists and communists, Zionists and Morm ons, atheists and Satanists, the po or and the rich...EVE RYONE! Above a ll thou gh, they use the ignorant, the lazy, the un interested an d uncritical. Among insiders, these persons are called “ILLUMINATI” (the enlightened one s, the initiates), Big Brother, the invisible government, the Grey Men, the shado w government, the secret government, the establishment... As far as I know, the so-called “Illuminati” started their dea lings o n this world abou t 300 ,000 B.C., when the “BROTHERH OOD OF THE SNAKE ” in Mesopo tamia, was infiltrated by the group o f peop le we call “Illuminati” toda y and was misused for their negative a ims. It is not only possible, but , very likely, that this drama had started much e arlier, at the time when the “ego” developed . But because of the work of the “Brotherhood of the Snake” we can trace this activity back to a time in history which was followed b y group s like Jews, Christians, Freemasons or other religious s ects only 3,000 generations later. Toda y, this “game” is played, among others, by a few members of the Zionist community, as the book will show, but it has neither started with them nor will it end with them. What had started way back then is toda y still following the same rules. It suffices therefore to look into the present situation to recogn ize where the p roblems are. If one wants to categorize the thought or belief system of the Illuminati at all, then perhap s one has to choo se “Machiavellism” which justifies power politics withou t ethical standa rds, then ce: political unscrupu lousness. An e xample: POWER You a re the new king of a country and you want to make sure to remain king. So you call two pe rsons to you, one a fter the other, of whom you a re sure that they would do a s told. The first one you edu cate according to “leftist” principles and you give h im fund s to set up a p arty. The second you a lso finan ce, but you a sk him to foun d a “right wing” party. Now you ha ve e stablished two oppo sing pa rti es, you finan ce propaganda , elections, activities and thus y ou a lways know their plans. You control them both. If you want one of them to be ahea d, you just give them m ore funds than the other . Both leade rs think you’re on their side, and you a re the “friend” of both. The peop le will be so caught-up in the to-ing and fro-ing of “left” and “right” that they will never suspect that you a s their king might be beh ind the dispute. The peop le will even a sk you for help an d advice. In the American Civil War (1861 -186 5) the Northern States (who oppo sed slavery) fought the Southern States (who were for slavery). Before the war the ROTHSCH ILD family had agents stir up pro-union feelings in the Northern States. Other agents, though, at the same time fanned secessionist feeling in the Southern states. When the war started The London Rothschild ban k finan ced the North an d The Paris Rothschild ba nk the South. The only real winne rs in this war were the ROTHSCH ILDS. To summarize the system: One creates c onflicts where peop le fight each other and not the true instigator. One is never seen as the instigator of the conflicts One supp orts all warring pa rties. One is seen a s the “ben efactor” who could end the conflict. Since the “illuminati” want to attain world po wer, their way to a chievement is to sow as much discord a s possible be tween the peop le an d nations of the world so these will be caught up in a ne t of misinformation an d will never find o ut who is really beh ind it all. The internationa l"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"7 SE CR ET SOCIETIES , which we a re abou t to look into, are the mightiest tool for sowing discord among the peop le. At the same time peop le are constantly involved in wars amongst themselves that eventually they will tire o f it and will “plead ” for a WORLD GO VE RN MENT. And he re we see the plan. The “ben eficial organization” will be called upon to en d the conflict. And who is this on this plane t? The UN ! Let us see who is actually beh ind the UN. The “Illuminati” m entioned he re are no t just anybod y, they are the richest peop le in the world. They never appea r on TV or in other media, since they not only own and therefore control all the mass media, but also the news agencies. And if ever something gets to be known abou t them, it is either neu tral or positive. The largest part of the popu lation doe s not even know their names. And the a uthors who alread y uncovered some of their machinations never became famous, although they shou ld have been a warded the Nobe l prize. It would be good to stand u p a gainst this, but how can 6 billion peop le fight against something they don ’t even know exists? It is a fact that almost the same number of peop le a re so caught up in their own pe rsona l “problems” they never had – or lost in the mean time – the over-all view of what happen s in the world and around them. The majority is suffering from “political frustration” and have therefore pulled ou t. Lack of time, failing interest, and insufficient discrimination be cause o f a lack in specialized knowledge, have led to this “abstinen ce”. But pulling out will not chan ge anything he re , on the contrary, this is what our “helmsmen” want. Every single one giving up makes it easier for them to reach their goal. Thus the first thing to d o is to gain knowledge of these goings-on. And a s a great world teacher said: “Find Truth, for Truth will set you free!” One could divide hu manity into three types: Those who cause things to happe n. Those who just watch what happen s. Those who a re surprised a t what has happene d. For this reason, this boo k is “m y” contribution to bring some o f these happen ings to light. It tries to p ass on the knowledge abo ut some o f the things that have bee n kept secret by the peop le who pu ll the strings upo n this plane t. The read er shall be enab led , if he just foun d himself und er item 3, to at least advance to item 2, if not to item 1! As the author of this boo k I am not representing any interest group, religious sect or nation. I am a human being upo n this plane t Earth who claims his right to freedo m and free development in o rder to fulfill his task here. And as I very much value pea ce among the nations and in human relations – just as a large segment of humanity doe s, hop efully – I see it as my persona l respon sibility to at least present this inform ation to my fellow men to enab le them to make their own de cisions. The following shou ld no t just be swallowed withou t chewing first, as one would the stories that are served to u s daily in the media. I would recommend that superficial peop le who a re happ y with things as they are, close the boo k right here. But those who a re used to looking b ehind the scene s may find a few far- reaching and challenging stimuli revealed. If we see ou rselves as real “finde rs” of truth and n ot just as life-long “seekers”, we shou ld grasp an y possibility to gain ne w knowledge, to test and eventually accept it. This c ould mean that if our mind is full of accepted views, opinions, dogmas or a set view of the world there is no more room for further TRUTH and that perhap s truth looks quite different from what we imagined .

Nevertheless, I will try on the following pages to stick to historical facts even if they are n ot yet widely perceived a s s uch. I left my persona l theo ries out in o rder to give a summary of the sources that are mentione d at the end of the book and that are gene rally accessible. [H: Dharm a, a good place to break s o that the portions are n ot unwieldy and a lso to allow a review of the typing. We can then have the “Introduction” to lead into the segments to follow in a more orderly sequen ce.] INTRODUC TION There are two levels of historical reality. The first is the gene ral so-called pub lic opinion that is s erved up to the a verage citizen b y the mass media and will l ater, because o f persons writing it down, become history. The second one , though, is made up o f the happen ings that are not revealed to the pub lic. This is the world of the machinations by secret lodges and secret societies which interlink capital, politics, economy and religion. O n this level nations are made , wars are instigated, presiden ts and lead ers are p ut in o ffice an d, in case they don ’t function, eliminated. The citizen who fashions his opinion and h is v iew of the world form what he gathers from the mass media like ne wspape rs, TV, radio, book learning and comm on literature will find most of the things revealed in the following pages unfamiliar. Thoughts like: “I never hea rd o f that!” are und erstandab le be cause secrets and the dealings of secret lodges only fulfill their purpose if they do remain secret. But the very existence of secret lodges s hows that there must be something that the lodge brothers find important to keep secret. What could that be? As I will show, many lodge brothers of different secret societies find themselves in po sitions that one can only dream abo ut. This s hows that whatever they keep secret from you ha s elevated them to these positions. Let me give you just one example he re to illustrate what I mean with “dream position”: One of the main organizations pulling strings in the U.S. is the CFR (Coun cil on Foreign Relations). This s emi-secret organization is dominated by the Rockefeller syndicate and a European secret society called “COMMITTEE OF 300” (explana tion follows). In the list of members of the “Committee of 300” that I got from Dr. John Coleman’s book Conspirator’s Hierarchy: The Committee of 300 , I foun d among o thers: “SIR JOHN J. LOUD EN” “He is representative in Londo n o f the ‘N.M. Rothschild Bank’. “His other positions are as follows: “Chairm an o f the internationa l advisory comm ittee of the ‘Chase Manha ttan Bank’ (Rockefeller). “Chairm an o f ‘Royal D utch Petroleum’/ “Director of the ‘Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd.’ And"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"9 “Trustee of the ‘Ford Founda tion’.” This s hows extraordinary power and influen ce in a single p erson. But how did he get there? This now has to do with the secret societies and orders of which he is a member. In this case it is the “Committee of 300 ”. And in that comm ittee there are 300 p ersons of the same caliber amongst themselves (and h e most certainly is not the mightiest). Can you imagine that decisions and resolutions made in meetings of these peop le can have a very great influen ce upon what happen s in the world? These persons keep secrets from the pub lic. They know some things that we do not, and therefore those who call themselves the “ILLUMINATI” (the enlightened one s, the initiates) are incredibly powerful. Wouldn’t you like to know w hat the secrets are the “illuminati” keep from you? Almost all the secrets have to d o with the pa st of our plane t, the history and the origin o f humanity (how and where?), the reason for our being he re, the so-called UFOs and the consequences thereof (UFOs = Unknown [Uniden tified] Flying Objects, the common na me for flying devices with two coun ter-rotating magnetic fields, mostly cigar- or saucer-shaped and of terrestrial of extraterrestrial origin). I presume that the word UFO is not welcome to some. That is why it is s o important to b e open for new things! And the subject of UFOs is not new, on the contrary. Peop le in Europe ha ve been just as misinformed as everyone e lse upon this Earth where UFOs are concerned . And that again ha s to do with the Illuminati who control the media! Especially here in Germany. I would like to give he re a n example to show just how real and earthly the b ackgroun d to this phen omenon can be: Beside the “THU LE-GESE LLSCH AFT ” (Thule Society), which will be de scribed in d etail later, there was ano ther secret order in the third Reich, the “VRIL-GESE LLSCH AT”. This was mainly occupied with the bu ilding of UFOs. They had , next to Viktor Schaube rger and Dr. W.O. Schumann , also Schriever, Habe rmohl, Miethe, Epp an d Belluzo working for them, whose de velopments were g reatly accelerated after – according to them – an d “extraterrestrial” saucer went down in the Black Forest in 1936 an d was hardly damaged. After having scrupu lously studied the drive and ha ving joined the findings to the alread y eno rm ous bod y of knowledge of the “Vril-Gesellschaft” abo ut implosion and a nti-gravity, they started to build their own p rototypes. Developments like the “Vril-7” (V-7), a disc- shaped supe rsonic helicopter (not to be confounde d with the V-1 an d V-2 cruise missiles) were so a stound ing that toda y’s s tealth bombers look like toys in comparison. The Vril-7 developed b y Richard Miethe, for example, and equ ippe d with twelve BMW 028 turbo-units, reached , in a test flight in Peen emunde on February 14, 1944 , in vertical take-off, the height of 24,200 meters and in h orizontal flight a spee d of 2,200 km/h. By the end of 194 2 several units of the circular aircraft RFZ 6 with the name “Hauneb ru II”, had alread y been bu ilt. It had a d iameter of 32 meters and a he ight at the central axis of 11 meters and near the ground it reached a speed of over 6,000 km/h. It had an op erationa l range of 55 hou rs, took off vertically and could fly horizontally, vertically and – most importantly – manoeu vre at right angles (a movement typical of all the UFOs observed a ll over the world). Later Vril developments were e ven more successful; as early as the b eginning of 194 5 they succeeded in flying a roun d the globe in a few hou rs. A large-capa city v ersion of the Hauneb ru II had a diameter of 120 meters and ha d integrated sleep ing q uarters. Just think why one would need sleep ing q uarters if one could fly aroun d the world in a few hou rs? (More abou t “Vril-Gesellschaft” and its developments in the chapter named accordingly). Many will now ask: “Why did Hitler not win the war if he had techno logies like these at his disposal?” The reason is that although a large number of these flying d isks s howed incredible pe rform ance, yet they were well nigh unu sable in a military context. The reason was that the magnetic field produ ced b y the levitation d rive a cted like a protective shield around the craft and, while it rende red it almost impossible to shoot down, was almost"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"10 impossible for the “conventiona l” weapon s to pene trate withou t “friction”. The projects were unde r the supervision of the “Vril-Gesellschaft” and the SS E IV (Secret Development Center for Alternative Energy of the SS ), I.e., they were no t directly unde r Hitler’s and the NSDAP ’s orders and ba sically were no t planned for war use. Only later when Germany’s s ituation deteriorated did on e think about using the flying d iscs in the war. Another reason is that most peop le ha ve no idea what Hitler’s real aims were, where he had bee n edu cated, of which lodges he was a member, whose ideo logy he adop ted, who put him in h is position, who finan ced him and what reasons there were beh ind the Second World War. Hitler’s ideo logy had nothing to do with what we call toda y the “general reality” and with what is told abo ut the Third Reich in schoo lboo ks. Hitler was a mystic and a n occultist down to his s hoes, and to und erstand what happene d in the Third Reich one ha d to look at it from this viewpoint, t oo. To most “materialists” among the historians, the Nuremberg Trials were a mixture o f G rimm’s fairy tales and stories from the mentally sick, because they were unab le to think themselves into the roles of the defendan ts, now had they the n ecessary knowledge to und erstand the stories these peop le told. Dieter Ruggebe rg pu ts this very aptly: “Only an o ccultist can recognize and o ccultist!” The chap ters abou t the “Thule-Gesellschaft” and the “Vril-Gesellschaft” will explain the ideo logy of these peop le in more d etail, Hitler and his s ecret societies knew a lot more abo ut the origin of humanity, the structure o f the Earth, anti-gravity and “free energy” than we a re taught toda y. That is also why all writings and bo oks that could d ivulge this knowledge were removed o r banne d by the Allies, to e nsure that humanity will remain e asily manipulated. The Allies’ main interest were the techno logies of the “Vril-Gesellschaft”. These were the best kept secrets of the Third Reich. The Russians got their hand s on the construction designs first , the scientists like Viktor Schaube rger and Wernhe r von Braun became – in the ope ration “Pape rclip” – the prey of the Americans. The resulting de velopments of flying machines are und er the h ighest security rating of the U.S. of A. They were a lso the reason why J.F. Kenned y had to d ie (see the chapter “The Kenned y Assassination”). There were, though, quite different experiments c onducted in the Third Reich which would all but destroy the views of the world so far erected by the read ers if given he re. Therefore they will later be treated sepa rately. Why have most peop le ne ver heard abo ut these things? For instance abou t the found ing of the Germ an state “Neuschwaben land ” (New Swabia) in the Antarctic during the Second World War? And why did U.S. Admiral Ri chard E B yrd require almost 4,000 arm ed troop s, an aircraft carrier and full military supp ort when he went to explore the Antarctic? And why did on ly a few hund red o f them return? Many open questions. Why have on ly few peop le hea rd of these things, or of the de velopments of NIKOLA TES LA, among which were free ene rgy machines, ene rgy transfer withou t cables, anti-gravitation and the changing of the weather by the a imed u se of “stand ing waves”? What consequences would the knowledge abou t free en ergy form s and ab out the u se of flying saucers, which on ly use a magne tic field for an ene rgy source, have? Especially if every citizen would ha ve a ccess to it, for their cars for example? No more, “Fill ‘ er up!” No po llutants, no pollution of the environment. No nu clear power stations and more; peop le could no longer be kept locked within the bound aries of a coun try, and we a ll would ha ve more free time because we wouldn’t have to work to pay for heating, petrol and e lectricity (in this time of life). And these ene rgy forms exist. They have been e xisting for at least ninety years and ha ve been kept secret all this time. Why were they kept secret? Because peop le o n this Earth are controlled b y ene rgy, food and retention of knowledge. If the knowledge abo ut these things and their use would be a vailable to a ll, the Illuminati or other “egoists” could n o longer play their power games. Churches, sects and drugs would"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"11 lose their importance. Therefore it is imperative for the Illuminati to keep these things from the rest of the world, in o rder to feed their greed an d their ego with their m ight. This was a side trip just to show that the UFO t heme is more explosive and real than many would ha ve it. The “strategy of ridicule” used b y the Anglo-American establishment has s o far cost several billion do llars, just to den igrate the UFO t heme b y the mass media successfully. On top of that: The first law in a secret lodge is to ne ver be mentioned pub licly, even saying the lodge n ame by a lodge brother is pun ishab le b y death in certain cases (in the “99 lodge” for example). In the secret schoo l of Pythagoras pronoun cing the last theo rem, the “octagon” was also pun ishab le b y dea th. The octagon is an important key to und erstand ing the “Merkaba” (the human geometric magnetic fields) and is therefore “illuminating”, that mean s a solution to our problems. (Mer-ka-bah = two coun ter rotating light fields, which transport both bod y and spirit = dematerialization and telepo rtation of the bod y.) Secrecy is proper power. It allows the e xecution o f ope rations withou t them being hinde red by legal entanglements or potential opponen ts, and it also fosters the interchange of higher knowledge among the knowing. Let us look here at the key scene from Umberto Eco’s In The Name of the Rose , when the blind abbo t asks the researching William of Baskerville: “ What do you actually want?” Baskerville an swers: “I want the Greek book which you say was never written. A book dea ling exclusively with comedy that you ha te a s much as laughter. Yet it is perhap s the only surviving copy of the second book of poetics by Aristotle. Many boo ks dea l with comedy, why is just this one so dangerous?” And the abbo t says: “Because it’s by Aristotle!” Baskerville: “What is do disquieting abo ut peop le laughing?” The abbo t: “Laughter kills fear, and withou t fear there is no faith. Who doe s not fear the devil no longer need s a God.” (With this sentence we a re ne arer a solution to many problems we e ver had o n this planet than we be lieve. Perhap s some o f you knew this alread y or will hope fully soon find o ut. Maybe you shou ld read this paragraph a second time.) When a secret lodge is deceiving the pub lic with fraud an d manipulation in o rder to attain political and e cono mic power – a t other peop le’s expen se - then secrecy, as in the foregoing example, can be come a dead ly tool. Of course I am not saying that all secret societies are de structive o r evil. One o f the many braches of Freemasonry for instance evolved a fter 130 7 from the KNIGHTS TEMPLAR whom the Vatican, und er pressure b y the French King Philippe IV, persecuted. Those who escaped capture and torture by the Inquisition mainly went to Portugal, England and Scotland , where for centuries they worked in secret to bring justice to the world and to further human rights. Yet history shows at the same time that the secret societies like the 33 rd degree o f the Scottish Rite o f Freemasons c an be a dangerous power with the ability to set up and dep ose governments and to use secret alliances for globa l alterations. Many boo ks have bee n written abo ut the Illuminati, mostly in English. Persona lly I disliked the fact that they were often written by fanatics, fanatical C hristians, fana tical Morm ons, fana tical Jeho vah’s Witnesses, by fanatical rightists or leftists, etc., who had realized what happened a roun d them, but had argued from their subjective view point and in the end pointed just to other group s or Satan a s the culprits. So I tried to collect the facts from the different fields of politics, religion and finance that in my opinion were most important and to summ arize them withou t evaluation, so they are a lso acceptable to non -religious and o ther free and thinking pe rsons and that dea ling with the cause can b e don e by everybody, whether they be white, black or yellow. And you will unde rstand why the Illuminati are interested that a single h uman be ing may not know everything."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"12 No au thor will perhap s 100 % succeed in pa inting a complete p icture o f the entanglements upon this planet, therefore the main focus of this book is to show you what the p ersons mentioned want and how they go abo ut it.

My historical review is just touching the tip of an icebe rg or, to stay within the context, the tip o f a p yramid. CH AP TER 1 TOO MANY LODGES IN THE B ROTH FREEMAS ONR Y is one of the oldest organizations s till i n e xisten ce toda y. Papyrus scrolls that were found in 1888 in e xcavations in the Libyan desert describe secret meetings of similar group s 200 0 B.C. These brotherhood s had alread y been involved in the bu ilding of the Temple of Solomon and fulfilled then their functions s imilar to toda y’s unions, yet they alread y had a mystical tradition. The o bjective of Masonry is given a s the inne r transformation through spiritual perfection in reverence o f G od. Since Freemasons belong to d ifferent religions, they call this God the “Great Builder of All Worlds”. Further references are foun d in the Egyptian Book of the Dead and the God Thoth who had been their Grand Master. “Grand Master” is the usual title for the h ighest leade rs. The spiritual knowledge of the Freemasons had bee n replaced by symbols, allegories and rituals which served communication. (A secret langu age with symbols, e.g., the Masonic ritual hand shake, the p yramid, the pen tagram, the use of the n umbers 3, 7, 13 and 3 3 in coats of arms, emblems and toda y in compan y logos and names.) The most important symbol in many organizations, including Freemasonry, is the apron. The apron, which a t the outset was s imple and unad orned , was replaced b y the PRIES THOOD OF MELCH IZEDEK around 2200 B.C. by a white lambskin and is still used like that toda y. In ancient Egypt, the Gods, who a ccording to o ld traditions were flying the “Divine Ships”, were represented in temple pa intings with the a pron. Later, the priests wore the a pron a s a sign o f devotion to the “flying gods” and as a sign of authority, representing"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"13 the Gods over the peop le. The members of the “BROTHERH OOD OF THE S NAKE ” alread y wore the ap ron aroun d 340 0 B.C. to show their submission to the Gods who came from hea ven in “flying whee ls”. It is doub tful that the lower grade s of the different lodges toda y know the initial use of the a pron. Before 130 7 the KNIGHTS TEMPLAR – together with the KNIGHTS OF ST. JOHN OF JERU SA LEM and in pa rt the TEUTONIC KNIGHTS (these two were o riginally charitable orders) – were lead ing organ izations beh ind the crusade s against the Muslims. Although these orders were inimical to each o ther, they foug ht together for Christianity. It is no coinciden ce that there is vaguene ss abou t the KNIGHTS TEMPLAR and their historical and occult backgroun d, for this uncertainty was established p urposefully – especially during the past 150 years. The secret about the Templars would no t be if it had not bee n made to be by circles and powers who had and ha ve an und erstandab le interest – from their point of view – to keep the truth in ob scurity. Thus it came to pass that the Templars shared a comm on destiny with their Lord Jesus Christ: As the latter’s teachings had been p erverted an d reversed when the Old Testament he had vehe mently fought against was added to the Christian do ctrine, so was the spirit of the Order of the Templars also turned. In b oth cases the central point of the falsification was the same. In recent times s everal “neo -pseudo Templar orders” have sprung up. Among these you certainly find peop le of good intent, but also charlatans and servants of exactly that spirit the o ld Templars had fought. An amalgamation of the n ame and spirit of the Templars with componen ts of Freemasonry is utterly grotesque , yet it was done (the Knights Templar degree in the York Rite). Two very pious men stood at the outset of the Order of the Knights Templar: Hugues of Payens and Geoffroy de St. Omer, a Frank and a Norman. They collected a group o f friend s s pirited b y a faith typical of the Middle Ages, a faith so powerful that we can hardly imagine it toda y. Christmas 1117 this small circle de cided to form a g roup for the protection of pilgrims in Jerusalem. It was their only wish to serve the Lord Jesus Christ and the faith. The group, now grown to n ine knights, stood rather alone – they had n o protection, nor ade quate fund s. Next spring the group went to Baldwin I, Latin king of Jerusalem, and to the p atriarch. Their intent was lauded , and – a fter having lived in the “German House”, a h ospital run by Germans – they were soon given quarters on the an cient site o f the Temple. And a lthough this earned them the name o f KNIGHTS TEMPLAR, they always unde rstood themselves to be the BROTHERS OF THE TRU E TEMPLE OF CHR IST by which they mean t to INN ER TEMPLE OF THE SOUL. The history of the Templars would be quite d ifferent and probab ly rather unimportant had they no d iscovered in the ruins of the Temple a rather remarkable find the Knights did n ot at first know w hat to d o with : These were remains of Hebrew w ritings, small scraps really, but whose contents would soon be come o f utmost importance to the Templars and the Order’s history from then on. These scraps were sent to the erudite Etienne Harding who got them translated. And this became the impetus for all that followed. The find proved to b e fragments of statements by Jewish e schaimin (spies) who, at the order of the priesthoo d, repo rted o n the actions of the “cursed mamzer (son of a whore) Jesus” and his “blasphemy against the God of Israel”. And the contents of these repo rts c onflicted absolutely with what was c omm only preached ! According to them, Jesus c alled the Hebrew god “JAHVE H” Satan an d reproached the Jews for having made the de vil himself into their only god. Traces of this can still be found in the Gospel of John in the New Testament , where Jesus tells the Jews “You be long to your father, the devil...” (John 8 :44). There ha d to ha ve been a n immense falsification o f the teachings of Christ!"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14 To unde rstand the profound shock that hit the Templars, one ha s to think of their strong faith. The God that the Church taught as “Father of Christ” was, in Jesus’ own words, the devil whom to fight he had come to Earth! A study of the Bible soon revealed to the comm on sense o f the simple Templars that the teachings of Jesus and the Old Testament were d iametrically oppo sed and therefore could ne ver belong together. Furthermore, the Jews never called their god “Father” but “JAHVE H” and “EL SHADD AI”. El Shadda i, though, was Sheitan, i.e., the fallen a ngel! (Shedde im = dep ravity, el = archangel. EL is often wrongly translated with God. “GOD” however is IL in the old o riental tongues). [H: Come on e, reade rs, this is all historical fact and has NOTHING t o do with my translation of mean ing. We p resent as it is presented. Furthermore, however, we a re in the L AND where El Shadda i is the b iggest breakoff f rom the ROMAN C atholic s ect and must be noted – in the form of “charismatic leade r” Brother Mike Velarde, in the Philippines and no w gaining great attention in the United States and other places of note. You ha ve to now unde rstand that the confrontations are b etween L EA DERS and a gain, as throughou t history, the masses of citizens are totally withou t knowing and are manipulated by the power brokers.] When, in the year 112 8, the formal found ing of the order took place, where Bernard de Clairvaux – later St. Bernard – a cted in a sense as patron, the small gathering alread y had a secret: It was their determ ination to pene trate the truth of the Christ. Up to then there was only uncertainty – soon one would know for sure. But one ha s to unde rstand this determination a s that of a group of almost naively pious knights who just wanted to serve their Lord Jesus Christ and to rediscover His true teachings. There was nothing a gg ressive in this, for they were no t insinua ting an y evil wrongdoing. It was Bernard who told them that their ambitions would be frowned upon an d that it would be wise no t to lay their thoughts open . In the following years, no further indications of the original teaching of Christ were foun d. The Order of the Templars now took on military tasks. The “secret” soon only lived on in the memories of a few, mainly Provencal brothers. The p ractical requirements in the Orient left little time or space to care abo ut the secret. The closer contact with Islam was giving new impulses. Some letters attributed to Ali Ibn Abu Thalib (Iman Ali) fell into the hand s of a Templar unit during an ad vance o n Damascus. In these, Ali told of a later falsification of the Koran which he likene d to the adu lteration in the Gospels of Christ. These pap ers got to the Provence where the old thought resurfaced to search of the truth o f the Christ. Now things happene d in qu ick succession : A document was passed o n to the Provencal comm andery which most probab ly came from Cathar circles. No wonde r then that later the Templars refused to take pa rt in the “crusade ” against the Cathars. It was a p iece of the original Gospel of John, written by the heretic Marcion in 94 A.D. A letter was enclosed that gave a brief history of Marcion’s life. Here we shou ld state that Marcion succeeded in found ing an important, purely Christian movement between 90 an d 130 A.D. that only started to d ecline after he was murdered. Marcion, who had a ctually met the apo stle John, taught that Jesus Christ was God incarnate, that there was no “father-god Jahveh”, but that this Hebrew god was Satan himself. He further said that Jesus promised the peop le “self- hea ling”, so only the good will of an individua l was required, but no temples and hen ce no Church o rgan ization. From then on a n “Order within the Order” established itself, a prope r sworn Marcionite group . This s pecial form ation within the Order of the Templars was mainly made u p o f Provencals and Germ ans. The majority of the Knights Templar at that time certainly never knew w hy the cross of the Order was c hanged from the simple equal-armed on to the “Knights’ Cross”. In the beginning the “Knights’ Crosses” known toda y did no t exist. The Templars wore a simple red cross in their white cloaks. Only the surreptitious influen ce o f"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"15 the Marcionites made the “Marcionite Cross” – the cross of thorns – the symbol of the Templars! In e arly Christian times the cross of thorns had bee n the symbol of the Marcionites; it was the “Heretic’s Cross”. It is s aid that the Evangelist John had fashioned a cross from thorns for the Holy Mother Mary. Marcion then chose the red cross of thorns as a sign of pure Christianity. To the initiate the Knights’ Cross, then is the symbol Marcion’s. In later times appea red the doub le cross of thorns of the Templars’ esoteric science. At the same time the Templars’ battle cry “Vive Dieu Saint Amour!” (Long live God of Holy Love) emerged to express the exclusive turning to Christ and the renun ciation of the Old Testament “god of revenge” image. The majority of peop le both within and withou t the Order were of course not privy to the unde rlying reasons of all this. The time did no t yet appe ar right; one was s till awaiting further irrefutable proof in do cuments of early Christianity. And such documents were indeed found , although in very roundabou t ways too complicated to retell here. Suffice it to say that two Templars foun d a very old Marcionite cache in some ruins in Carthage. They were no t there b y acciden t, but following the trail of Marcion who had bee n there quite o ften. They foun d not just scraps of the o riginal writings of John an d Matthew but also a n old Carthaginian faith and creation manu script including the Greed translation p robab ly by Marcion h imself. And in the manu script, the “Ilu Aschera”, one could recognize the true founda tions of the teachings of Christ. Of the “Templar revelation” from the year 1236 it is only important to mention that it heralds a b right realm in the “land of midnight” (Germany) the precursors of which shou ld be the select of the Knights Templar. The revelation o ccurred when a female manifestation appea red to two knights in a room of the old Carthage an d gave them that very message. Because of this v ision, Berlin-Temple of (“temple court”) was founded a s the Northern capital of the “New Babylon”. What creed, what attitude o f mind and what view of the world d id the Templars actually represent? The medieval Occiden t rested on three pillars: The Jewish-Christian religion, the finan ce and trade e conomy based o n the p erm ission to ask for interest given in the Old Testament , and the principle of an a bsolutist rule. The Templars aimed at pulling those p illars down a s soon a s time and their growing possibilities for action were right. So, the e limination o f the Jewish-Christian church an d the e stablishment instead o f an early Christian den omination with the exclusion o f all Old Testament componen ts, resulting from this a revolutiona ry chan ge o f the finan cial and economic s ystem and a ba n on interest, the abo lition of the absolutist mona rchies and the establishment of an aristocratic-repub lican o rder. This of course shows that the ruling powers had to seed to destroy the Templars. After the fall of Jerusalem, which mean t the final victory of the Muslims, the Knights of the Order of St. John fled the Holy Land an d in the following years lived on Mediterranean island s whose na mes they used in their titles. So they were first called the “KNIGHTS OF RH ODES ”, then the “KNIGHTS OF MALTA”. They became an amazing military and na val force in the Mediterranean u ntil they were d efeated by Napo leon in 1789 . In 183 4 their head quarters had been transferred to Rome, and toda y they are known a s the “SOVE REIGN AND MILITARY ORD ER OF MALTA” (SMOM) (the Maltese Cross). Members are, among others, the deceased William Casey (Ex-Chief of the CIA 1981 -87), Alexande r Haig (former U.S. Secretary of State), Lee Iacocca (Chairm an o f Chrysler Corp.), James Buckley (Radio Free Europe ), John McCone (CIA-Chief und er Kenned y), Alexand re de Marenches (Head of the French Secret Service) and Valerie Giscard d ’Estaing (former presiden t of France). Because they failed to save the Holy Land , the Knights Templar fell on difficult times. Therefore, in 1307 they were pe rsecuted b y the Vatican at the instigation of Philippe IV (“Le"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"16 Bel”, The Fair). They were a ccused of Satanic and other practices, and of course King Philippe had a lways envied them their power and p rivileges. So the Knights Templar flew France to seek refuge in safer land s like Portugal, England and Scotland where the Vatican’s might was diminished . There some of them joined the alread y existing Masonic lodges and worked unde r new iden tities for the Protestant Reformation to revenge their persecution by the Catholic Church. Another group o f Templars was re-established in Portugal. There they changed their name to “Knights of Christ” and later, were rehab ilitated b y Pope Clement V. They again gained substantial power. On March 1 8, 131 4, Philippe IV had the Grand Master JACQUES DE MOLAY burnt at the stake in front of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. The FRANC ISCANS and the DOMINICANS were two further institutions at the time o f the Crusade s. The FRANC ISCANS adop ted the robe with the cord an d thew tonsure form the Egyptian b rotherhoo d at El Amarna and were quite humane. The DOMINICANS, however, were the tools of probab ly the cruelest institution ever created by man: The Catholic Inquisition. In 14 th century Germany, the h ighest initiates of the “BROTHERH OO D OF THE S NAKE ”, together with its bod y of knowledge, appe ared for the first time und er the La tin name of “ILLUMINATI” (the biblical term for snake, “naha sh” derives from the root NH SH which mean s “deciphe r, discover”; the Latin term “ illuminare” mean s “to illumine, to recognize, to know). One of the main branches of the Illuminati in Germany was the mystical Rosicrucians who were introdu ced at the beginning of the 9 th century by Charlemagne. The first official lodge was founded in Worms in 110 0 A.D. The Rosicrucians had the n erve to pretend to have knowledge of the (extraterrestrial) origin of humanity and of the Egyptian esoteric doctrine. They were commende d for their work with mystical symbols and their alchemy. The conne ction be tween Rosicrucians and the Illuminati was very close, so that rising in the secret initiation d egrees often led to being admitted b y the Illuminati. The reason that ROSICRUC IANS are very difficult to trace is that every large branch o f the brotherhood worked open ly for 108 years after its founda tion, only to continue the ne xt 108 years in secret. These changing pha ses created the impression that the order had disappea red in the mean time an d so made the brothers’ w ork easier. Some a uthors give 1614 a s the year the Rosicrucians order was established b ecause then a document was pub lished in Hesse annou ncing their existence an d calling for members to sign u p. At this time ano ther pha se of pub lic work had started. The document called for peop le to give up false teachers like the Pope, Aristotle an d Galen (a popu lar physician of antiquity) ; it told the story of the fictitious “Christian Rosenkreutz” – to symbolize their found ing. Toda y the latter is often falsely given a s the true found er. The system with the 108 -year cycle had been a real success! The ROSICRUC IANS toda y are represented by several branches who ha ve de veloped into one of the most positive o rders and aim to use their knowledge for the spiritual and mental deliverance of the individua l (e.g., the AMORC , Antiquus Mysticus Order Rosae Crusis = Ancient Mystical Order of the Rosy Cross). The Illuminati and the Rosicrucians were the driving force beh ind the religious drive du ring the years of pestilence. They were joined b y the “FRIEND S OF GOD” who had a strong apo calyptic teaching and d emande d absolute obed ience to their rulers. The whole movement was later passed o n to the “ORD ER OF ST. JOHN ” whom Albery MacKey in h is boo k “Encyclopaed ia of Freemasonry” calls a “Freemason organization with a secret mission. MARTIN LUTHER also ha d close links to both the Illuminati and the Rosicrucians, which insiders c ould recognize b y his s eal (a rose and a cross with h is initials, like the seal of the Rosicrucians).

This helped the Medici to be come on e o f the richest and most influen tial banking hou ses in Europe. LUTHER”s rebe llion a gainst the Catholic Church was justified be cause the latter had become a business institution rather than a place of faith. One o f the lead ing pe rsona lities of the reform ation was PHILIP OF HESSE , called The Magnan imous, who founded the first Protestant University at Marburg and organized a po litical alliance against the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. After LUTHER’s dea th his c onfessiona l comm unity was s uppo rted by SIR FRANC IS BA CON, the h ighest Rosicrucian in England . Unde r KING JAMES I Bacon coordinated the project of writing an authorized Protestant English Bible. This version was first pub lished in 1611 an d became a s the “King James Bible” , the most widely used b ible in the English-speaking world. [H: Please read that again – 1611 an d hardly 2000 years ago.] The Coun ter-Reform ation was led b y a ne w brotherhoo d, the Society of Jesus, better known as the JES UITS. These were formed in 153 4 by Ignatius Loyola and they were a militant Catholic s ecret society with secret rituals, symbolism and initiation d egrees (the oa th for the 2 nd degree demande d the de ath of all Freemasons and Protestants). The JES UITS were sent to England to fight aga inst the Protestant heretics. They were very busily searching for heretics to pun ish, which mean t that the Freemasons really had to guard their secrets else they stood to lose their head s. The FREE MASONS worked in total secrecy in England, Scotland an d Ireland and promoted the ob servance of human rights and o f Protestantism. The signing of the MAGNA CARTA was attended b y the Grand Masters of the Freemasons and of the Knights Templar, and the different lodges were a lso respon sible for the Protestant movements in England and in Germany. In1717 the Londo n Masonic Lod ge began to work in p ublic for they thought England to b e safe eno ugh. This time is given in many history books as the start of Freemasonry. That is officially correct, but their secret work s tarted thou sand s of years before, yet, as I mentioned before, the secrecy would ha ve been a ll but pointless if toda y everybod y would know w hen and where the Freemasons had bee n up to what. The pub lic work by the Londo n Lodge caused g reat consternation among the other Masonic lodges who a ccused the Londone rs of treason. When this s immered do wn, the Freemasons began to spread all over Europe and the New World. Later they emerged in the New World with the Declaration of Independen ce and with the “Boston Tea Party” which was organized by the BOSTON MAS ONIC LODGE. John Lo cke, for instance, used the Masonic tenan ts when he wrote the constitution of the offered colony of South Carolina, which later became a Masonic bastion. The writings of Sir Francis Bacon also reflect the philosoph ies of the Freemasons. The Declaration of Independen ce was written and signed almost exclusively by Freemasons. GEORGE WASHINGTON and most of his generals were FREE MAS ONS. It is a fact that withou t the work of the Freemasons the United States of America would no t exist toda y.

The rich Jewish rabb is, the religious and po litical leade rs of the crushed Jewish peop le, united their power in a group that became known a s “THE ELDERS OF ZION”. (The Zionists s ee themselves as the “messianic” elite of Juda ism and expect all Jews of the world to show solidarity with their aims. Manfred Adler: The Sons of Darkness Part 2.) From 1640 to 168 9 the “ELDERS OF ZION” in the Netherland s planned the “English Revolution” (the dep osition of the Stuarts from the British throne), and loaned mone y to the many splinter parties. Years before they had u sed their influen ce to have WILLIAM I, THE SILENT, a Germ an prince of the House o f Nassau, lead the Dutch arm y and later to make him WILLIAM PRINC E OF ORANGE. They arranged a meeting between h im and Mary, the e ldest daughter of the DU KE OF YORK and sister of Charles II of England , and with the latter’s brother and successor James II. WILLIAM and MARY were married in 167 7 and ha d a son, William III, who later m arried Mary II, the daughter of James II. Now the Dutch an d British royal hou ses were related. In 1688 they forced the Stuarts, with the aid of the Whigs, a pa rty of influen tial English an d Scot persona lities, from the throne , and in 1689 WILLIAM III OF ORANGE was named KING OF ENGLAND . WILLIAM III, who is purported to ha ve been Freemason, founde d in the same year the LOYA L ORANGE ORD ER, which is anti-Catholic and a imed at firm ly establishing Protestantism in England . The order still exists toda y and has around 100 ,000 members in Ireland where it is most strongly represented and is fann ing the flames of the religious war. King William III soon got England involved in costly wars against Catholic France, which got England dee p in deb t. Here was William’s c han ce to return the favor to the ELDERS OF ZION. With the aid of the agent WILLIAM PA TERSON he persuade d the Treasury to borrow 1.25 million Pound s Sterling from the Jewish ban kers who had he lped him to the throne. Since the state’s deb ts had risen dramatically, the government had no choice but to accept. The lend ing cond itions were a s follows: The names of the lende rs are to remain secret, and they are granted the right to establish a “Bank of England ” (CENTRAL BA NK). The directors of the said ba nk are permitted to set the gold standa rd for pap er m one y. They are permitted to lend 1 0 pound s in pape r mone y for every pound of gold depo sited. They are permitted to consolidate the n ationa l deb t and to raise the sum from the peop le b y direct taxes. Thus the first PRIVATE CENTRAL BA NK, the “Bank of England ”, was established . This kind o f banking business brought a 5 0% profit on a n investment by the ba nk of 5%. The English peop le ha d to pay for it. The lend ers were n ot at all interested to have the sums they had Loaned repa id for the indeb tedne ss gave them political influen ce. England ’s nationa l debt rose from 1,250,000 pound s in 169 4 to 1 6,000 ,000 pound s in 1698 .

CH AP TER 3 MAS ONR Y E QUALS FREE DOM In 156 7 the English Freemasons split into two lodges, the “York” and the “London ”. The most important time in the history of Freemasons though was the b eginning of the 17 th century, when the character of a guild of stone masons c hanged to that of a mystical and occult one. The lodges were a lso opened for “non-m asons”, which led to the fact that around 170 0 almost 70% of all Masons c ame from other professions. On June 24, 171 7, representatives of the four British lodges met in London an d founded the English Grand Lodge, also called the “Mother Grand Lodge of the World”. The new initiation system had three d egrees: Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft and Master Mason, the so-called “Blue Degrees”. The Grand Lo dge definitely wanted for the Hano verians to remain o n the British throne and thus “gave” the first two d egrees to Frede rick, Prince o f Wales, in 173 7. Some of the later generations of Hano verians even be came Grand Masters (Augustus Frederick, King George IV, King Edward VII, and King George VI.) Yet they also had en emies. In 168 8, after the overthrow of King James II, the Stuarts’ suppo rters s tarted several group s, among them the militant JACOBITES , attempting to bring the Stuarts back to the throne. A new branch of Freemasonry, the “Scottish Templar Lodge”, was founde d by Andrew Michae l R amsay in 1725 to supp ort James III and it took in former Knights Templar. This lodge ha d higher degrees than the Mother Grand Lodge in London , and b y this it was attempted to draw members from there. 1736 saw the found ing o f the “Grand Lo dge o f Scotland ” which a lso limited the guild a spect to a minimum and fostered mysticism. In the Scottish lodges Templar Freemasonry was widely adhe red to and later Templar degrees were given. As we see, there were no w two systems of Freemasonry that were inimical, the Hano verians in the MOTHER GRAND LODGE in London an d the Stuarts in the SCOTTISH TEMPLAR LODGE.

Shortly after Mayer Amschel Baue r changed h is name to Rothschild (in Germ an: rotes Schild = red shield). His business became known a s the House o f Rothschild. Mayer m arried sixteen year old Gutele Schnape r and fathered five sons and five da ughters. The sons’ names were Amschel, Salomon, Nathan, Kalman (Charles) and Jakob (James). His rise to fame accelerated when he was favored b y PRINC E WILLIAM X OF HESSE - HANAU i n whose compan y he a ttended Freemasons’ meetings in Germ any. Prince William, a friend of the Hano verians, took in large sums for the Hesse mercena ry arm ies he had loaned to the English (Hano verian) king. These were the same troops who later fought the arm y of G eorge Washington at Valley Forge. Rothschild be came William’s persona l banker. When William had to flee to Denmark because of political unrest, he left the mercena ries’ pay – 600 ,000 poun ds – in Rothschild’s ban k for safe-keeping. NATHAN R OTHSCH ILD (Mayer Amschel’s eldest son) took this sum with h im to Londo n in o rder to establish an other ban k there. The gold that was used a s security came from the “East India Compan y”. Nathan made four-fold profit from lend ing notes to the DU KE OF WELLINGTON w ho thus finan ced his military ope rations. The profits were further raised by the later illegal sale of the gold mean t to serve a s s ecurity. This was the origin of the gigantic wealth of the Rothschild family. Then they started internationa l banking operations by having each son op ening a ba nk in d ifferent coun tries, Amschel in Berlin, Salomon in Vienna , Jakob in Paris and Kalman in Naples.

It is alleged that in 1773 MAYE R AMSCHEL ROTHSCH ILD held a secret meeting in the hou se in the Juden strasse (Jews’ Street) in Frankfurt with twelve influen tial and rich Jewish finan cial backers (THE E LDERS OF ZION) to forge a plan ho w to control the complete fortune of the world. According to Herbert G. Dorsey, they spoke abo ut the fact that the BA NK OF ENGLAND alread y made a substantial control of English wealth po ssible, but that complete control was necessary as the founda tion for the control of the fortune of the world. This was then sketched and n oted do wn. The eviden ce he ld b y Dorsey and William Guy Carr ( Pawns in the Game) shows this to be the p lan that later became known a s THE P ROTOCOLS OF T HE E LDERS OF ZION .

What I am abou t to set forth, then, is our system from the two po ints of view, that of ourselves, and that of the goyim (i.e., human cattle = Non-Jews). It must be noted that men with bad instincts are more in n umber than the gook, and therefore the best results in governing them are attained by v iolence and terrorization, and not by academic discussion. Every man a ims at power, everyone would like to become a dictator if only he could, and rare indee d are the men who would no t be willing to sacrifice the welfare of all for the sake o f securing their own welfare. What has restrained the bea sts of prey who a re called men? What has s erved for their guidan ce h itherto? In the b eginnings of the structure of society they were subjected to brutal and b lind force; afterwards to Law, which is the same force, only disguised. I draw the conclusion that by the law of nature, right lies in force. Political freedo m is an idea b ut not a fact. This idea on e must know how to app ly when ever it appea rs necessary with this bait of an idea to attract the masses of the peop le to one ’s party for the p urpose o f crushing ano ther who is in a uthority. This task is rende red easier if the oppone nt has himself bee n infected with the idea of freed om, so-called liberalism , and, for the sake o f an idea , is willing to yield some o f his power. It is precisely here that the triumph o f our theory appea rs: the slackened reins of government are immediately, by the law of life, caught up and gathered together by a ne w hand , because the blind might of the nation cann ot for one single da y exist withou t guidan ce, and the new authority merely fits into the place of the o ld alread y weakened b y liberalism. In o ur day, the po wer, which ha s replaced that of the rulers who were liberal, is the po wer of gold. Time was when Faith ruled. The idea of freed om is impossible of realization be cause no one knows how to u se it with mode ration. It is eno ugh to hand o ver a peop le to self- government for a certain length o f time for that peop le to be turned into a disorganized mob. From that moment on we get internecine strife, which soon de velops into b attles between classes, in the midst of which States burn do wn and their importance is redu ced to that of a heap of ashes. Whether a State e xhau sts itself in its own convulsions, whether its internal discord brings it unde r the po wer of external foes, in an y case, it can be accoun ted irretrievably lost: it is in our power . The de spotism of Capital, which is entirely in ou r hand s, reaches out to it a straw that the State, willy-nilly, must take ho ld o f; if not, it goes to the b ottom.

Men in masses and the men o f the masses, being g uided solely by petty passions, paltry beliefs, customs, traditions and sentimental theorism, fall a prey to p arty dissension, which h inde rs any kind of agreement even on the b asis of a perfectly reasonab le argument. Every resolution of a crowd depend s upon a chance or packed majority, which, in its ignorance o f political secrets, puts forth some ridiculous resolution that lays in the a dministration a seed of anarchy. The political has nothing in common with the moral. The ruler who is governed by the moral is not a skilled po litician, and is therefore unstable on h is throne. He who wishes to rule must have recourse both to cunn ing and to make be lieve. Great nationa l qualities, like frankness and hone sty, are vices in po litics, for they bring do wn rulers from their throne s more e ffectively and more certainly than the most powerful enemy. Such qualities must be the attributes of the kingdoms of the goyim , and we must, in n o wise, be guided b y them. Our right lies in force. The word “right” is an ab stract thought and proved b y nothing. The word mean s no more than: G ive me what I want in order that thereby I might have p roof that I am stronger than you .

The p art played b y the Press is to keep pointing out requirements suppo sed to b e indispen sable, to give voice to the complaints of the peop le, to express and to create discontent. It is in the Press that the triumph of freed om of speech finds its incarnation. But the goyim States have no t known ho w to make use of this force, and it has fallen into our hand s. Through the Press we ha ve gained the power to influen ce while remaining ourselves in the shade ; thanks to the Press we ha ve got the GO LD in ou r hand s, notwithstand ing that we ha ve had to gather it out of ocean s of blood and tears. But it has paid u s, though we ha ve sacrificed many of our peop le. Each victim on ou r side is worth in the sight of G od a thou sand goyim.

There remains a small space to cross and the whole long path we ha ve trodden is read y now to close its cycle of the Symbolic Snake, by which we symbolize ou r peop le. When this ring closes, all the States of Europe will be locked in its c oil as in a powerful vise. The constitution scales of these da ys will shortly break down, for we ha ve e stablished them with a certain lack of accurate balance in order that they may oscillate incessantly until they wear through the pivot on which they turn. The goyim are unde r the impression that they have welded them sufficiently strong and they have a ll along kept on e xpecting that the scales would come into e quilibrium. But, the pivots – the kings on their throne s – a re hemm ed in b y their representatives who p lay the fool, distraught with their own un controlled and irresponsible po wer. This power they owe to the terror, which ha s bee n breathed into the pa laces. As they have no means of getting a t their peop le, into their very midst, the kings on their thrones are n o longer able to come to terms with them and so strengthen themselves against seekers after power.

O ur power is in the chronic s hortness of food an d physical weakness of the worker because b y all that this implies he is made the slave o f our will, and he will not find in h is own au thorities either strength or energy to set against our will.

After a thoroug h study of this k nowledge the peop les will voluntarily submit to a uthority and accept such position as is appointed them in the State. In the present state of knowledge and the d irection we ha ve given to its development the peop le, blindly believing things in p rint, cherishes – thanks to promptings intended to mislead and to its own ignorance – a b lind h atred towards all cond itions which it considers abo ve itself, for it has no und erstand ing of the mean ing of class and cond ition.

We have de monstrated that progress will bring all the goyim to the sovereignty of reason.

When the popu lace has s een that all sorts of concessions and indu lgences are yielded it in the n ame of freed om it has imagined itself to be sovereign lord and has stormed its way to power, but, naturally, like e very other blind man it has come upo n a h ost of stumbling blocks, it has rushed for a guide, it has never had the sense to return to the former state and it has laid do wn its plenipotentiary powers at our feet. Remember the French Revolution, to which it was we who gave the name of “Great”; the secrets of its preparations are well known to us for it was wholly the work of our hand s. Ever since that time we ha ve been lead ing the peop les from one d isenchan tment to ano ther, so that in the end they shou ld turn a lso from us in favor of that King-Despot of the b lood of Zion, whom we are prepa ring for the world. At the present day we a re, as an internationa l force, invincible, because if attacked by some we a re suppo rted b y other States.

From the premier-dictators of the present day the goyim peop les s uffer patiently and be ar such abu ses as for the least of them they would ha ve beheaded twenty kings. What is the explana tion of this pheno meno n, this c urious inconsequen ce o f the masses of the peop les in their attitude towards what would appea r to b e events of the same order? It is explained b y the fact that these d ictators whisper to the peop les through their agents that through these abu ses they are inflicting injury on the States with the h ighe st purpose – to secure the welfare o f the peop les, the internationa l brotherhoo d o f them all, their solidarity and equality of rights.

For this reason we, when we come into our kingdom, shall have to erase this word from the lexicon of life as implying a p rinciple of brute force which turns mobs into b loodthirsty bea sts. The bea sts, it is true, fall asleep again every time when they have d runk their fill of blood , and a t such times c an easily be riveted into their chains. But if they be no t given b lood they will not sleep and continue to struggle.   PROTOCOL 4 Every repub lic passes through several stages. The first of these is c omprised in the early days of mad raging b y the blind mob, tossed hither and thither, right and left; the second is demagogy, from which is born ana rchy, and that lead s inevitably to de spotism – n ot any longer legal and o vert, and therefore respon sible de spotism, but too unseen an d secretly hidden , yet nevertheless sensibly felt despotism in the han ds of some secret organization o r other, whose a cts are the more unscrupu lous inasmuch a s it works beh ind a screen, beh ind the ba cks of all sorts of age nts, the changing of whom not only doe s not injuriously affect but actually aids the secret force by saving it, thanks to continua l changes, from the ne cessity of expend ing its resources on the rewarding of long service. Who and what is in a position to o verthrow an invisible force? And this is precisely what our force is. Gentile masonry blindly serves as a screen for us and our objects, but the plan of action of our force, even its v ery abiding place, remains for the whole peop le and u nknown mystery. But even freedo m might be harmless and ha ve its place in the state e cono my withou t injury to the well-being of the peop les if it rested upon the founda tion o f faith o f G od, upon the brotherhood of humanity, unconne cted with the conception o f equality, which is negative b y the very laws of creation, for they have e stablished subordination. With such a faith as this a peop le might be governed b y a wardship of parishes, and would walk contentedly and humbly unde r the guiding han d o f its spiritual pastor submitting to the dispositions of G od upon ea rth. This is the reason why it is indispen sable for us to unde rmine a ll faith, to tear out of the minds of the g oyim the very principle of Godhead an d the spirit, and to p ut in its place a rithmetical calculations and material need s. In order to give the goyim time to think and take n ote, their m inds must be diverted towards indu stry and trade. Thus, all the nations will be swallowed up in the pu rsuit of gain and in the race for it will not take n ote of their common foe. But again, in o rder that freedo m may once for all disintegrate and ruin the comm unities of the goyim , we must put indu stry on a speculative ba sis; the result of this will be that what is withdrawn from the land b y indu stry will slip through the hand s and pa ss into speculation, that is, to our classes. The intensified struggle for superiority and shocks delivered to e conomic life will create, nay, have a lread y created d isenchanted, cold an d hea rtless communities. Such communities will foster a strong a version towards the h igher political and towards religion. Their only guide is gain, that is Gold, which they will erect into a veritable cult, for the sake o f those material delights which it can give. Then will the hou r strike when , not for the sake of attaining the good, not even to win wealth, but solely out of hatred towards the privileged, the lower classes of the goyim will follow our lead against our rivals for power, the intellectuals of the goyim .

What form of rule is to b e given to these communities if not that despotism which I shall describe to you later? We shall create an intensified centralization of government in o rder to g rip in o ur hand s all the forces of the comm unity. We shall regulate mechan ically all the a ctions of the political life of our subjects by new laws. These laws will wi thdraw one b y one a ll the indu lgences and liberties which ha ve been pe rmitted b y the goyim , and o ur kingdom will be distinguished b y a despotism of such magnificent propo rtions as to be at any moment and in every place in a po sition to wipe ou t any goyim who oppo se u s by deed or word. We shall be told that such a d espotism as I speak of it is not consistent with the progress of these da ys, but I will prove to you that it is. In these times when the peop les looked upo n kings on their throne s as on a pu re manifestation of the will of G od, they submitted withou t a murm ur to the d espotic power of kings, but from the da y when we insinua ted into their m inds the conception o f their own rights they began to regard the occupa nts of throne s as mere ordinary mortals. The holy unction of the L ord’s Anointed has fallen from the head s of kings in the eyes of the peop le, and when we a lso robbed them of their faith in God the might of power was flung upo n the streets into the p lace o f pub lic proprietorship and was s eized b y us. Moreover, the art of directing masses and individua ls by mean s of cleverly manipulated theo ry and verbiage, by regulations of life in common an d all sorts of other quirks, in a ll which the goyim und erstand n othing, belongs likewise to the specialists of our administrative brain. Reared on ana lysis, observation, on delicacies of fine calculation, in this s pecies of skill we ha ve no rivals, any more than we ha ve e ither in the drawing up o f plans of political actions and solidarity. In this respect the Jesuits alone might have compared with u s, but we ha ve contrived to d iscredit them in the eyes of the unthinking mob as an o vert organization, while we ou rselves all the while h ave kept our secret organization in the shade . However, it is probab ly all the same to the world who is its s overeign lord, whether the hea d o f Catholicism or our despot of the blood of Zion! But to us, the Chosen Peop le, it is very far from being a matter of indifference. For a time perhaps we might be successfully dea lt with by a coalition of the GOYIM of all the world , but from this danger we a re secured by the discord existing among them whose roots are so deep ly seated that they can ne ver now be p lucked up. We have set one a gainst ano ther the persona l and n ationa l reckonings of the goyim, religious and race h atreds, which we ha ve fostered into a huge growth in the course o f the pa st twenty centuries. This is the reason why there is not one State which would an ywhere receive suppo rt if it were to raise its arm, for every one of them m ust bear in mind that any agreement aga inst us would be unp rofitable to itself. We a re too strong – there is no end ing to o ur power. The nations canno t come to even a n inconsiderable private agreement without our secretly having a hand in it. Per Me rege s regnan t . “It is through Me that Kings reign.” And it was s aid b y the proph ets that we were chosen b y God Himself to rule o ver the whole ea rth. God has endo wed u s with genius that we may be equal to o ur task. Were genius in the oppo site camp it would still struggle a gainst us, but even so a newcomer is no match of the o ld-established settler; the struggle would be merciless between u s, such a fight as the world ha s never yet seen. Aye, and the genius on their side would ha ve a rrived too late. All the whee ls of the machinery of all States go by the force of the e ngine, which is in ou r hand s, and that engine of the machinery of State is – Gold. The science of political econo my invented b y our learned e lders has for long past bee n giving royal prestige to capital. Capital, if it is to co-operate untrammeled, must be free to establish a monopo ly of indu stry and trade ; this is alread y being p ut in e xecution b y an unseen han d in a ll quarters of the"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"30 world. This freed om will give po litical force to those engaged in indu stry, and that will help to op press the peop le. Nowada ys it is more important to disarm the peop les than to lead them into war; more important to use for our advantage the passions which ha ve bu rst into flames than to quen ch their fire; more important to catch up and interpret the idea s of others to suit ourselves than to eradicate them. The principal object of our directorate consists in this: to debilitate the pub lic mind b y criticism; to lead it away from serious reflections calculated to arouse resistance; to d istract the forces of the mind towards a sham fight of empty eloquen ce . In a ll ages the peop les of the world, equally with individua ls, have a ccepted words for deed s, for they are content with a show and rarely pau se to n ote, in the pub lic arena , whether promises are followed by performance. Therefore we shall establish show institutions which will give e loquen t proof of their bene fit to progress. We shall assume to ourselves the liberal physiognomy of all parties of all directions, and we shall give that physiognomy a voice in orators who will spea k s o much that they will exhau st the p atience of their hearers and produ ce an abho rrence of oratory. In order to put pub lic opinion into o ur han ds we must bring it into a state of bewilderm ent by giving e xpression from all sides to so many contradictory opinions and for such a leng th of time as will suffice to make the g oyim lose their head s in the labyrinth and come to see that the be st thing is to ha ve n o opinion o f any k ind in matter political, which is not given to the pub lic to und erstand, because they are unde rstood on ly by him who guides the pub lic. This is the first secret. The second secret requisite for the success of our government is c omprised in the following : To multiply to such a n extent nationa l failings, hab its, passions, cond itions of civil li fe, that it will be impossible for anyone to know w here he is in the resulting chaos, so that the peop le in consequen ce will fail to unde rstand one an other. This measure will also serve u s in ano ther way, namely, to sow discord in a ll parties, to dislocate a ll collective forces which a re still unwilling to submit to u s, and to discourage any kind of personal initiative which might in any degree hinde r our affair. There is nothing more dang erous than persona l initiative ; if it has genius beh ind it, such initiative can do more than can be don e by millions of peop le among whom we ha ve sown d iscord. We must so d irect the edu cation of goyim comm unities that whene ver they come upo n a matter requiring initiative they may drop their hand s in de spairing impotence. The strain which results from freed om of action saps the forces when it meets with the freedom of ano ther. From this c ollision a rise g rave moral shocks, disenchan tments, failures. By all these mean s we shall so wear down the go yim that they will be compelled to offer us internationa l power of a nature that by its position will enab le u s withou t any violence g radua lly to absorb all the State forces of the world and to form a Supe r-Government . In place of the rulers of toda y we shall set up a bogey which will be called the Supe r-Government Administration.

This object will be be st attained b y increasing the burden s upo n landed prope rty – in load ing land s with deb ts. These measures will check land -holding and keep it in a state o f humble and un cond itiona l submission. The aristocrats of the goyim , being hereditarily incapab le of contenting themselves with little, will rapidly burn up an d fizzle ou t. At the same time we must intensively patronize trade an d indu stry, but, first and foremost, speculation, the p art played b y which is to provide a counterpoise to indu stry; in ab sence o f speculative indu stry will multiply capital in p rivate hand s and will serve to restore a griculture by freeing the land from inde btedne ss to the land ba nks.

Nowada ys, if any States raise a protest against us it is only pro forma at our discretion and b y our direction, for their anti-Semitism is indispen sable to u s for the manag ement of our lesser brethren . I will not enter into further explana tions, for this matter has formed the subject of repe ated discussions amongst us. For us there are n o checks to limit the range o f our activity. O ur Super-Government subsists in e xtra-legal cond itions which a re described in the a ccepted terminology by the ene rgetic and forcible word – Dictatorship. I am in a position to tell you with a clear conscience that at the prope r time we, the law-givers, shall execute judgment and sentence; we shall slay and we shall spare; we, as head of all our troop s, are mounted o n the steed of the leade r. We rule b y force of will, because in o ur hand s are the fragments of a on ce po werful party, now vanquished b y us. And the weapon s in ou r han ds are limitless ambitions, burning greed iness, merciless vengean ce, hatreds and malice. It is from us that the all-engu lfing terror proceed s. We have in our service persons of all opinions, of all doctrines, restorating mona rchists, demagogue s, socialists, comm unists, and utopian d reamers of every kind . We have ha rnessed them all to the task: each one of them on h is own a ccoun t is boring a way at the last remnants of authority, is striving to overthrow all established form of order . By these acts all States are in torture ; they exhort to tranquility, are read y to sacrifice for pea ce : but we will not give them pea ce until they open ly acknowledge o ur internationa l Super-Government, and with submissivene ss. The peop le ha ve raised a howl abou t the ne cessity of settling the question o f Socialism by way of an internationa l agreement. Division into fractiona l parties has given them into o ur hand s, for, in order to carry on a contested strugg le on e must have mone y, and the mone y is all in ou r han ds. We might have reason to ap prehen d a un ion b etween the “clear-sighted” force o f the goy kings on their thrones and the “blind” force of the goy mobs, but we ha ve taken a ll the nee dful measure a gainst any such po ssibility; between the one an d the other force we ha ve erected a bu lwark in the shap e o f a mutual terror between them. In this way the b lind force of the peop le remains our supp ort and we, and we on ly, shall provide them with a leade r and , of course, direct them along the road that lead s to our goal. In order that the han d o f the b lind mob may not free itself from our guiding han d, we must every now and then e nter into close communion with it, if not actually in pe rson, at any rate through some o f the most trusty of our brethren. When we a re a cknowledged a s the on ly authority we shall discuss with the peop le pe rsona lly on the market places, and we shall instruct them in questions of the po litical in such a wise a s may turn them in the d irection that suits us. Who is going to verify what is taught in the village schoo ls? But what an envoy of the government or a king on his throne himself may say canno t but become immediately known to the whole State, for it will be spread b y the voice of the peop le. In order not to ann ihilate the instructions of the goyim before it is time we ha ve touched them with craft and de licacy, and ha ve taken ho ld of the end s of the springs which move their m echan ism. These springs lay in a strict but just sense o f order; we ha ve replaced them by the chao tic license of liberalism. We have got our hand s into the administration o f"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"34 the law, into the condu ct of elections, into the press, into liberty of the person, but principally into edu cation and training a s being the corner-stones of a free existence . We have fooled, bemused an d corrupted the youth o f the goyim by rearing them in principles and theories which a re known to u s to be false a lthough it is by us that they have been inculcated. Above the e xisting laws withou t substantially altering them, and b y merely twisting them into contradictions of interpretations, we ha ve e rected something grand iose in the way of results. These results found e xpression first in the fact that the interpretations masked the laws ; afterwards they entirely hid them from the eyes of the government owing to the impossibility of making anything o ut of the tangled web of legislation. This is the origin of the theo ry, of course, of arbitration. You may say the goyim will rise upon us, arms in hand , if they guess what is going o n before the time comes; but in the West we ha ve a gainst this a maneu ver of such appa lling terror that the very stoutest hearts quail – the und ergroun ds, metropo litans, those subterranean corridors which, before the time comes, will be d riven unde r all the capitals and from when ce those capitals will be b lown into a ir with a ll their organizations and archives.  PROTOCOL NO. 10 Toda y I begin with a repe tition of what I said b efore, and I beg you to bear in mind that governments and peop les are content in the political with outside appea rances. And how, indeed , are the goyim to perceive the und erlying mean ing of things when their representatives give the be st of their ene rgies to enjoying themselves? For our policy it is of greatest importance to take cognizance of this detail: it will be o f assistance to u s when we come to consider the division o f authority, freedo m of speech, of the press, of religion (faith) ., of the law of association, of equality before the law, of the inviolability of prope rty, of the d welling, of taxation (the idea of concealed taxes), of the reflex force o f the laws. All these questions are such a s ought not to b e touched upo n directly and open ly before the peop le. In cases where it is indispen sable to touch upon them they must not be categorically named, it must merely be d eclared withou t detailed e xposition that the principles of contemporary law are acknowledged b y us. The reason of keep ing silence in this respect is that by not naming a principle we leave ou rselves freed om of action, to drop this or that out of it withou t attracting notice; if they were a ll categorically named they would appea r to ha ve been alread y given. The mob cherishes a special affection and respect for the geniuses of political power and accepts all their deed s of violence with the a dmiring respon se: “Rascally, well, yes, it is rascally, but it is c lever !...a trick, if you like, but how craftily played, how magnificently done , what impruden t auda city ! ” We count upo n attracting all nations to the task erecting the ne w fund amental structure, the project for which ha s been drawn up b y us. This is why, before everything, it is indispen sable for us to a rm ourselves and to store u p on ourselves that absolutely reckless auda city and irresistible might of the spirit which in the pe rson o f our active workers will break down a ll hindrances on our way. When we h ave a ccomplished o ur coup d’etat we shall say then to the various peop les: “Everything ha s gone terribly bad ly, all have bee n worn out with sufferings. We are destroying the causes of your torment – n ationa lities, frontiers, differences of coinage s. You are at liberty, of course, to pronoun ce sentence upo n us, but can it possibly be a just one if it is c onfirmed by y ou before you make a ny trial of what we are offering you.”...Then will the mob e xalt us and be ar us up in their hand s in a unan imous triumph of hope s and expectations. Voting, which we have made the instrument which will set us on the throne of"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"35 the world by teaching e ven the very s mallest units of members of the h uman race to vote b y mean s of meetings and agreements by group s, will then have served its purposes and will play its part then for the last time by a unan imity of desire to make close a cqua intance with us before condemning u s. To secure this we must have everybod y v ote withou t distinction of classes and qua lifications in o rder to establish an ab solute majority, which canno t be got from the edu cated propertied classes. In this way, by inculcation in a ll a sense of self-importance, we shall destroy among the goyim the importance of the family and its edu cationa l value and remove the p ossibility of individua l minds s plitting off, for the mob, hand led b y us, will not let them come to the front nor even give them a hea ring; it is accustomed to listen to us only who pa y it for obed ience and attention. In this way we shall create a blind, mighty force which will never be in a po sition to move in an y direction withou t the guidan ce o f our agents s et at its hea d by us as leade rs of the mob. The peop le will submit to this regime be cause it will know that upon these leade rs will depend its earnings, gratifications and the receipt of all kinds of ben efits. A scheme o f government shou ld come read y made from one brain, because it will never be clinched firm ly if it is allowed to be split into fractiona l parts in the minds of many. It is allowable, therefore, for us to ha ve cognizance of the scheme of action but not to discuss it lest we d isturb its artfulness, the interdependen ce o f its compone nt parts, the practical force of the secret mean ing of each clause. To discuss and make alterations in a labo r of this kind b y mean s of numerous votings is to impress upon it the stamp o f all ratiocinations and misunde rstand ing which ha ve failed to pen etrate the depth and ne xus of it plottings. We want our schemes to be forcible an d suitably concocted. Therefore WE OUGHT NOT TO FLING THE WORK OF GENIUS OF OUR GUIDE to the fangs of the mob o r even of a select compan y. These schemes will not turn e xisting institutions upside do wn just yet. They will only effect chan ges in their econo my and consequen tly in the whole combined movement of their progress, which will thus be directed along the paths laid do wn in ou r schemes. Unde r various names there exists in a ll countries app roximately one an d the same thing. Representation, Ministry, Sena te, State Coun cil, Legislative and Executive Corps. I need not explain to you the mechan ism of the relation o f these institutions to one an other, because you a re aware of all that; only take n ote of the fact that each o f the abo ve-named institutions c orrespond s to some important function of the State, and I would be g you to remark that the word “important” I app ly not to the institution b ut to the function; consequently it is not the institutions which a re important but their functions. These institutions have d ivided up a mong themselves all the functions of government – administrative, legislative, executive, wherefore they have come to operate a s do the organs in the h uman bod y. If we injure one p art in machinery of State, the State falls s ick, like a human bod y, and will die. When we introdu ced into the State organism the poison of Liberalism its whole po litical complexion unde rwent a change. States have bee n seized with a mortal ill ness – blood- poisoning. All that remains is to a wait the end of their dea th a gony. Liberalism produ ced Constitutiona l States, which took the place of what was the only safeguard o f the goyim, namely, Despotism; and a constitution, as y ou well know, is nothing else bu t a schoo l of discords, misunde rstand ings, quarrels, disagreements, fruitless party agitations, party whims – in a word, a schoo l of everything that serves to destroy the persona lity of State activity. The tribune of the “talkeries” has, no less effectively than the Press, cond emned the rulers to inactivity and impotence, and thereby rend ered them useless and superfluou s, for which reason indee d they have been in many coun tries depo sed. Then it was that the era of repub lics became po ssible o f realization; and then it was that we replaced the ruler by a caricature of a government – by a president, taken from"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"36 the mob, from the midst of our puppe t creatures, our slaves . This was the found ation of the mine which we ha ve laid unde r the goy peop le, I shou ld rather say, und er the goy peop les. In the ne ar future we shall establish the respon sibility of presiden ts. By that time we shall be in a po sition to disregard forms in carrying through matters for which ou r persona l pupp et will be respon sible. What do we care if the ranks of those striving for power shou ld be thinned , if there shou ld arise a dead lock from the impossibility of finding presiden ts, a dead lock which will finally disorganize the country? In order that our scheme may produ ce this result we shall arrange e lections in favor of such presiden ts as have in their past some dark, und iscovered stain, some “Panama” or other – then they will be trustworthy agents for the a ccomplishment of our plans out of fear of revelations and from the n atural desire of everyone who ha s attained po wer, namely, the retention of privileges, advantages and hono r conne cted with the o ffice of presiden t. The chamber of dep uties will provide cover for, will protect, will elect the presiden t, but we shall take from it the right to p ropo se new, or make changes in e xisting laws, for this right will be given b y us to the respon sible p resident, a pupp et in o ur hand s. Naturally, the authority of the presiden t will then be come a target for every possible form of attack, but we shall provide h im with a mean s of self-defense in the right of an appea l to the peop le, for the decision of the peop le over the head s of their representatives, that is to say, an appea l to the same b lind slave of ours – the majority of the mob. Independe ntly of this we shall invest the presiden t with the right of declaring a state of war. We shall justify this last right on the ground that the president as chief of the whole a rm y of the country must have it at his disposal, in case o f need for the d efense of the new repub lican constitution, the right to defend which will belong to him as the respon sible representative of this constitution. It is easy to unde rstand that in these cond itions the key of the shrine will li e in ou r hand s, and no on e outside ourselves will any longer direct the force o f legislation. Besides this we shall, with the introduction of the ne w repub lican constitution, take from the Chamber the right of interpolation on government measures, on the pretext of preserving political secrecy, and, further, we shall by the ne w constitution redu ce the number of representatives to a minimum, thereby propo rtiona tely redu cing political passions and the passion for politics. If, however, they shou ld, which is hardly to be e xpected, burst into flame, even in this minimum, we shall nullify them by a stirring appea l and reference to the majority of the whole peop le... Upon the president will depend the appo intment of presiden ts and vice-presiden ts of the Chamber and the Senate. Instead of constant sessions of Parliaments we shall redu ce their sittings to a few months. Moreover, the presiden t, as chief of the e xecutive po wer, will have the right to summon and d issolve Parliament, and , in the latter case, to prolong the time for the appo intment of a new parliamentary assembly. But in order that the consequen ces of all these acts which in substance are illegal, should no t, prematurely for our plans, fall upon the respon sibility established b y us of the presiden t, we shall instigate ministers and other officials of the highe r administration abou t the president to e vade h is dispositions by taking measures of their own, for doing which they will be made the scapegoats in h is place...This part we especially recommend to be given to be p layed b y the Senate, the Coun cil of State, or the coun cil of Ministers, but not to an individua l official.

By such measures we shall obtain the power of destroying little by little, step by step, all that at the o utset when we en ter on our rights, we a re compelled to introdu ce into the constitutions of States to p repare for the transition to an imperceptible abo lition of every kind"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"37 of constitution, and then the time is c ome to turn every form of government into our despotism .

We shall promulgate a law making a ll former members of secret societies liable to exile from Europe as the center of our rule. Resolutions of our government will be final, withou t appea l. In the goy societies, in which we ha ve p lanted and deep ly rooted discord and protestantism, the on ly way of restoring o rder is to employ merciless measures that prove the d irect force of authority; no regard must be pa id to the victims who fall, they suffer for the well-being of the future. The attainment of that well-being, even at the e xpen se of sacrifices, is the duty of any kind of government that acknowledges as justification for its existence n ot only its privileges but its obligations. The principal guarantee o f stability of rule is to confirm the aureole of power, and this aureole is attained on ly by such a s majestic inflexibility of might as s hall carry on its face the emblems of inviolability from m ystical causes – from the choice of God. Such was, until recent times, the Russian au tocracy, the on e and on ly serious foe we ha d in the world, without counting the Papa cy . Bear in mind the e xample when Italy, drenched with b lood , never touched a hair of the hea d o f Sulla (Some versions of the “ Protocols ” followed Joly’s “ Dialogue s” so closely that Joly’s mistaken spelling of Sulla’s name a s “Sylla was also copied. In the translation of the “ Protocols ” here used, however, the mistake was rectified.), who had po ured forth that blood .

The peop le do n ot lay a finger on him who h ypno tizes them by his daring and strength o f mind.

All these lodges we shall bring unde r one central administration, known to us alone and to a ll others absolutely unknown, which will be composed o f our learned e lders. The lodges will have their representatives who will serve to screen the abo ve-m entioned a dministration of masonry"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"44 and from whom will issue the watchword and p rogram. In these lodges we shall tie together the knot which b inds together all revolutiona ry and liberal elements. Their composition will be made up of all strata of society. The most secret political plots will be known to u s and will fall unde r our guiding hand s on the very day of their conception. Among the members of these lodge s will be a lmost all the agen ts of internationa l and nationa l police since their service is for us irreplaceab le in the respect that the po lice is in a p osition no t only to use its own pa rticular measures with the insubordinate, but also to screen our activities and p rovide pretexts for discontents, et cetera . The class of peop le who most willingly enter into secret societies are those who live by their wits, careerists, and in gene ral peop le, mostly light-m inde d with whom we shall have no difficulty in dea ling and in u sing to wind up the mechan ism of the machine de vised b y us. If the world grows agitated the mean ing of that will be that we ha ve had to stir it up in order to break up its too great solidarity. But if there shou ld a rise in its midst a plot, then a t the hea d of that plot will be n o other than one of our m ost trusted servants . It is natural that we and no o ther shou ld lead Masonic activities, for we know w hither we a re lead ing; we know the final goal of every form of activity where a s the goyim have knowledge of nothing, not even of the immediate e ffect of action; they put before themselves, usually, the momentary reckoning of the satisfaction of their self-opinion in the accomplishment of their thought withou t even remarking that the very conception ne ver belonged to their initiative bu t to o ur instigation of their thought... The goyim enter the lodges out of curiosity or in the hop e by their mean s to g et a nibble a t the pub lic pie, and some o f them in o rder to o btain a hea ring before the pub lic for their impracticable a nd g round less fantasies; they thirst for the e motion of success and app lause, of which we a re remarkably gene rous. And the reason why we give them this success is to make use of the h igh conceit of themselves to which it gives birth, for that insensibly disposes them to assimilate our suggestions withou t being on their guard aga inst them in the fullness of their confidence that it is their own infallibility which is giving utterance to their own thou ght and that it is impossible for them to b orrow those o f others. You cann ot imagine to what extent the wisest of the goyim can b e brought to a state o f unconscious naivete in the presence o f this cond ition of high conceit of themselves, and at the same time how easy it is to take the hea rt out of them by the slightest ill-success, thoug h it be nothing more than the stopp age of the app lause they had, and to redu ce them to a slavish submission for the sake o f winning a rene wal of success. By s o much as ours disrega rd success if only they c an carry throug h their plans, by so much the GO YIM are willing to sacrifice a ny plans only to have success . This psychology of theirs materially facilitates for us the task of setting them in the required d irection. These tigers in appea rance ha ve the souls of sheep a nd the wind b lows freely through their hea ds. We have set them on the hobb y-horse of an idea abo ut the a bsorption of individua lity by the symbolic unit of collectivism ... They have ne ver yet and they never will have the sense to reflect that this hobb y-horse is a manifest violation of the most important law of nature, which ha s established from the very creation o f the world one un it unlike ano ther and precisely for the p urpose of instituting individua lity. If we ha ve been ab le to bring them to such a p itch of stupid b lindne ss, is it not a proof, and an a mazingly clear proof, of the degree to which the mind of the goyim is und erdeveloped in comparison with ou r m ind? This it is, mainly, which guarantees our success. And ho w far-seeing were ou r learned e lders in an cient times when they said that to a ttain a serious end it behoo ves not to stop at any mean s or to count the victims sacrificed for the sake o f that end ...We have no t counted the victims of the seed o f the goy cattle, though we have sacrificed for many of our own, but for that we ha ve no w alread y given them such a position on e arth as they could n ot even ha ve d reamed of. The comparatively small"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"45 numbers of the victims from the number of ours have p reserved ou r nationa lity from destruction. Death is the inevitable end for all. It is better to bring that end nea rer to those who h inde r our affairs than to o urselves, to the founde rs of this affair. We execute Masons in such a wise that none save the brotherhood can e ver have a suspicion of it, not even the victims themselves of our death sentence, they all die when requ ired as if from a n orm al kind o f illness. Knowing this, even the brotherhood in its turn dare not protest. By such method s we ha ve p lucked ou t of the midst of Masonry the very root of protest against our disposition. While preaching liberalism to the goyim we at the same time keep our own peop le and ou r agents in a state o f unquestioning submission. Unde r our influen ce the execution of the laws of the goyim has been redu ced to a minimum. The prestige o f the law has been e xploded b y the liberal interpretations introdu ced into this sphe re. In the most important and fund amental affairs and questions judges decide as we dictate to them, see matters in the light wherewith we en fold them for the a dministration of the goyim , of course, through p ersons who a re ou r tools though we do n ot appe ar to ha ve anything in common with them – b y newspape r opinion o r by other means. Even senators and the high administration a ccept our counsels. The purely brute mind of the goyim is incapab le of use for ana lysis and ob servation, and still more for the forseeing whither a certain mann er of setting a question may tend. In this difference in capa city for thought between the goyim and o urselves may be clearly discerned the seal of our position o n the Chosen Peop le an d o f our higher qua lity of humanne ss, in contradiction to the brute mind o f the goyim . Their eyes are ope n, but see nothing b efore them and do n ot invent (unless, perhap s, material things). From this it is plain that nature h erself has destined u s to guide an d rule the world. When comes the time o f our overt rule, the time to manifest its blessings, we shall make a ll legislatures, all our laws will be b rief, plain, stable, withou t any kind of interpretations, so that anyone will be in a po sition to know them perfectly. The main feature which will run right through them is submission to orders, and this principle will be carried to a g rand iose he ight. Every abu se will then d isappea r in consequen ce o f the responsibility of all down to the lowest unit before the h igher authority of the representative of power. Abuse of power subo rdinate to this last instance will be so mercilessly pun ished that non e will be foun d anxious to try experiments with their own po wers. We shall fillip up jealously every action of the a dministration o n which depend s the smooth runn ing of the machinery of the State, for slackness in this produ ces s lackness everywhere; not a single case of illegality or abu se o f power will be left withou t exemplary pun ishment. Concealment of guilt, conn ivance be tween those in the service of the administration – a ll this kind of evil will disappea r after the very first examples of severe pun ishment. The aureole of our power demands s uitable, that is, cruel, pun ishments for the slightest infringement, for the sake of gain, of its supreme prestige. The sufferer, though h is pun ishment may exceed h is fault, will coun t as a soldier falling on the administrative field of battle in the interest of authority, principle an d law, which do no t permit that any of those who ho ld the reins of the pub lic c oach shou ld turn aside from the pub lic highway to their own private pa ths. For example: our judge s will know that whene ver they feel disposed to plume themselves on foolish clemency they are violating the law of justice which is instituted for the exemplary edification of men by pena lties for lapses and not for display of the spiritual qua lities of the judg e. Such qualities it is prope r to show in p rivate life, but not in a pub lic square which is the edu cationa ry basis of human life. Our legal staff will serve no t beyond the age o f 55, firstly because old men more obstinately hold to prejudiced opinions, and are less c apab le of submitting to new directions, and second be cause this will give u s the po ssibility by this measure o f securing e lasticity in the chan ging of staff, which will thus the more easily bend unde r our pressure; he who wishes to"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"46 keep his place will have to give b lind obed ience to de serve it. In gen eral, our judges will be elected b y us only from among those who thoroughly unde rstand that the part they have to play is to pun ish an d app ly laws and no t to dream abou t the manifestations of liberalism at the e xpen se of the edu cationa ry scheme of the State, as the goyim in these da ys imagine it to b e. This method o f shuffling the staff will serve a lso to e xplode an y collective solidarity of those in the same service and will bind a ll to the interests of the government upon which their fate will depend . The young g eneration of judges will be trained in certain views regarding the inadmissibility of any abu ses that might disturb the e stablished order of our subjects among themselves. In these da ys the judges of the goyim create indu lgences to every kind o f crime, not having a just und erstand ing of their office, because the rulers of the present age in appo inting judges to office take n o care to inculcate in them a sense of duty and consciousness of the matter which is demanded of them. As a brute bea st lets out its young in search of prey, so do the goyim give their objects places of profit withou t thinking to make clear to them for what purpose such place was created. This is the reason why their governments are being ruined b y their own forces through the acts of their own ad ministration. Let us borrow from the e xample of the results of these actions y et ano ther lesson for our government. We shall root out liberalism from all the important strategic posts of our government on which depend s the training of subordinates for our State structure. Such po sts will fall exclusively to those who ha ve been trained by us for administrative rule. To the possible objection that the retirement of old servants will cost the Treasury hea vily, I reply, firstly, they will be p rovided with some private service in p lace of what they lose, and , second ly, I have remark that all the money in the world will be concentrated in o ur han ds, consequently it is not our government that has to fear expen se. Our absolutism will i n a ll things be logically consecutive and therefore in ea ch one of its decrees our supreme will will be respected an d unque stionab ly fulfilled; it will i gnore a ll murmurs, all discontents of every kind and will destroy to the root every kind of manifestations of them in act by pun ishment of an exemplary character. We shall abo lish the right of cassation, which will be transferred e xclusively to ou r disposal – to the cognizance of him who rules, for we must not allow the conception a mong the peop le of a thought that there could be such a thing a s a decision that is not right of judges set up by us. If, however, anything like this s hou ld o ccur, we shall ourselves c assate the d ecision, but inflict therewith such e xemplary pun ishment on the judge for lack of und erstand ing of his duty and the purpose of his appo intment as will prevent a repetition of such cases. I repea t that it must be borne in mind that we shall know every step of our administration which on ly need s to be closely watched for the peop le to be content with u s, for it has the right to demand from a good government a good official. Our government will have the appe arance of a p atriarchal gua rdianship o n the part of the ruler . Our own na tion an d our subjects will discern in h is person a father caring for their every need , their every act, their every inter-relation as s ubjects one with ano ther, as well as their relations to the ruler. They will then be so thoroughly imbued with the thought that it is impossible for them to dispen se with the wardship and guidan ce, if they wish to live in p eace and qu iet, that they will acknowledge the a utocracy of our ruler with a devotion bo rdering on AP OTHEOSIS, especially when they are convinced that those whom we set up d o not put their own in p lace of authority, but only blindly execute h is dictates. They will be rejoiced that we ha ve regulated everything in their lives as is don e by wise pa rents who de sire to train their children in the cause of duty and submission. For the peop les of the world in regard to the secrets of our polity are e ver through the ages only children unde r age, precisely as are also their governments."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"47 As you see, I foun d our despotism on right and duty: the right to compel the e xecution of duty is the direct obligation of a government which is a father for its subjects.

Their officials and professors will be prepared for their business by detailed secret programs of action from which they will not with imm unity diverge, not by one iota. The will be appo inted with especial precaution, and will be p laced as to be wholly dependen t upon the government. We shall exclude from the course of instruction State Law as also a ll that concerns the political question. These subjects will be taught to a few dozens of persons c hosen for their pre-eminen t capa cities from among the number of the initiated. The universities must no longe r send o ut from their halls milksops c oncocting p lans for a constitution, like a comedy or a traged y, busying themselves with que stions of policy in which even their own fathers never had any power of thoug ht. The ill-guided a cquaintance of a large number of persons with question of polity creates utopian d reamers and bad subjects, as y ou can see for yourselves from the e xample of the universal edu cation in this direction o f the goyim. We must introduce into their edu cation a ll those principles which ha ve so b rilliantly broken u p their order.

Classicism, as also an y form of study of ancient history, in which there are more ba d than good examples, we shall erase from the memory of men all facts of previous c enturies which are unde sirable to us, and leave on ly those which dep ict all the errors of the go vernment of the goyim . The study of practical life, of the ob ligations of order, of the relations of peop le one to ano ther, of avoiding bad and selfish examples, which spread the infection of evil, and similar questions of an ed ucative na ture, will stand in the forefront of teaching p rogram, which will be d rawn up on a sepa rate p lan for each calling or state of life, in n o wise generalizing the teaching.

These theo ries will be raised b y us to the stage of a dogma of faith as a transitiona l stage towards our faith. On the completions of this exposition o f our program of action in the present and the future I will read you the principle of these theo ries. In a word, knowing by the experience of many centuries that peop le live and a re guided by idea s, that these idea s are imbibed by peop le on ly by the a id of edu cation p rovided with equal success for all ages of growth, but of course b y v arying method s, we shall swallow up and confiscate to o ur own u se the last scintilla of independen ce of thought, which we ha ve for long pa st bee n directing towards s ubjects and idea s useful for us.

They do n ot usually decline to unde rtake an y defense whatever, they strive for an acquittal at all costs, caviling over every petty c rux of jurispruden ce and thereby they demoralize justice. For this reason we shall set this profession into narrow frames which will keep it inside this s phere of executive pub lic s ervice. Advocates, equally with judges, will be dep rived o f the right of communication with litigants; they will receive bu siness only from the court and will study it by notes of report and d ocuments, defend ing their clients after they have been interrogated in court on facts that have appea red. They will receive an hono rarium withou t regard to the quality of the d efense. This will rende r them mere repo rters on law-business in the interests of justice and a s coun terpoise to the proctor who will be the repo rter in the interests of prosecution; this will shorten business before the court. In this way will be e stablished a practice of hone st unp rejudiced defense condu cted n ot from persona l interest but by conviction. This will also, by the way, remove the present practice of corrupt bargain b etween ad vocates to a gree only to let that side win which pa ys most.

Among the n umber of those methods one o f the most important is – agents for the restoration of order, so p laced to have oppo rtunity in the disintegrating a ctivity of developing and d isplaying their evil inclinations – ob stinate self-conceit, irrespon sible e xercise of authority, and, first and foremost, vena lity."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"51  PROTOCOL NO.18 When it becomes necessary for us to strengthen the strict measures of secret defense (the most fatal poison for the prestige o f authority) we shall arrange as simulation of disorders or some manifestation o f discontents finding e xpression through the co-operation of good spea kers. Round these speakers will assemble a ll who a re sympathetic to his utterances. This will give u s the pretext for domiciliary perquisitions and surveillance on the part of our servants from among the nu mber of the goyim police. As the majority of conspirators act out of love for the game, for the sake of talking, so, until they commit some overt act we shall not lay a finger on them but only introdu ce into their midst observation e lements. It must be remembered that the prestige o f authority is lessened if it frequently discovers c onspiracies against itself; this implies a presumption of consciousness of weakness, or, what is s till worse, of injustice. You a re a ware that we ha ve broken the prestige o f the goy kings by frequen t attempts upo n their lives through o ur agents, blind sheep of our flock, who a re easily moved b y a few liberal phrases to crimes provided on ly they be pa inted in po litical colors. We have compelled the rulers to acknowledge their weakness in advertising o vert measures of secret defense and thereby we shall bring the promise of authority to destruction . Our ruler will be secretly protected only by the most insignificant guard, because we shall not admit so much as a thought that there could e xist against him any sedition with which he is not strong eno ugh to contend an d is c ompelled to hide from it. If we shou ld ad mit this thought, as the goyim have done and are doing, we shou ld ipso facto be signing a de ath sentence, if not for our ruler, at any rate for his dynasty, at no d istant date. According to strictly enforced outward appea rances our ruler will employ his power only for the ad vantage of the nation an d in n o wise for his own of domestic profits. Therefore, with the ob servance of this decorum, his authority will be respected and guarded by the subjects themselves; it will receive an apo theo sis in the ad mission that with it is boun d up the well- being of every citizen of the State, for upo n it will depend a ll order in the common life of the pack. Overt defense of the king argue s weakness in the organ ization o f his streng th . Our ruler will always among the peop le b e surrounded b y a mob appa rently curious men and women, who will occupy the front ranks abo ut him, to all appea rance by chan ce, and will restrain the ranks of the rest out of respect as it will appea r for good order. This will sow an e xample of restraint also in others. If a petitione r appea rs among the peop le trying to hand a p etition an d forcing h is way through the ranks, the first ranks must receive the petition and before the e yes of the p etitione r pass it to the ruler, so that all may know that what is handed in reaches its destination, that, consequently, there e xists a control of the ruler himself. The aureole o f power requires for its existence that the peop le may be ab le to say: “If the king knew of this,” or: “the king will hea r of it.” With the e stablishment of official secret defense the mystical prestige a uthority disappea rs ; given a certain aud acity, and e veryone counts him m aster of it, the sedition-m onger is conscious of his strength, and when o ccasion serves watches for the moment to make an attempt upon a uthority. For the go yim we ha ve been p reaching something e lse, but by the very fact we a re enab led to see what measures of overt defense have b rough t them to. Criminals with u s will be a rrested at the first more or less well-grounde d suspicion; it cann ot be a llowed that out of fear of a po ssible mistake a n oppo rtunity shou ld b e given o f escape to persons s uspected o f a political lapse in crime, for in these matters we shall be literally"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"52 merciless. If it is still possible b y stretching a point, to a dmit a reconsideration of the motive causes in simple crimes, there is no possibility of excuse for persons occupying themselves with questions in which nobod y except the government can und erstand an ything. And it is not all government that unde rstand true po licy.  PROTOCOL NO. 19 If we do no t permit any independen t dabb ling in the po litical we shall an the o ther hand encourage e very kind of repo rt or petition with p ropo sals for the government to examine into all kinds of projects for the amelioration of the cond ition of the peop le; this will reveal to u s the d efects or else the fantasies of our subjects, to which we shall respond e ither by accomplishing them or by a wise rebu ttment to prove the short-sightedne ss of one who judges wrongly. Sedition-m ongering is nothing more than the yapp ing of a lap-dog at an elephan t. For a government well organized, not from the police bu t from the pub lic point of view, the lap-dog yaps at the e lephan t in e ntire un consciousness of its s trength and importance. It need s no more than to take a good e xample to show the relative importance o f both an d the lap-dog s will cease to yap an d will wag their tails the moment they set eyes on a n elephan t. In order to destroy the prestige of heroism for political crime we shall send it for trial in the category of thieving, murder, and e very kind of abominab le and filthy crime. Public opinion will then confuse in its conception this category of crime with the disgrace a ttaching to e very other and will brand it with the same contempt. We have done o ur best, and I hope we ha ve succeede d, to o btain that the goyim should n ot arrive a t this mean s of contend ing with sedition. It was for this reason that through the press and in spee ches, indirectly – in cleverly compiled schoo lbooks on history, we ha ve advertised b y sedition-m ongers for the idea of the commonweal. This advertisement has increased the contingent of liberals and h as brought thou sands of goyim into the ranks of our livestock cattle.   PROTOCOL NO.20 Toda y we shall touch upo n the finan cial program, which I put off t o the end o f my report as being the most difficult, the crowning and the d ecisive po int of our plans. Before e ntering upon it I will remind you that I said that the sum total of our actions is s ettled b y the question of figures. When we come into our kingdom our autocratic government will avoid, from a principle o f self-preservation, sensibly burden ing the masses of the peop le with taxes, remembering that it plays the p art of father and protector. But as State organization costs dea r it is necessary nevertheless to obtain the fund s required for it. I will, therefore, elaborate with pa rticular precaution the question of equilibrium in this matter. Our rule, in which the king will enjoy the legal fiction that everything in his State be longs to him ( which may easily be translate into fact), will be enab led to resort to the lawful confiscation of all sums of every kind for the regulation of their circulation in the State. From this follows that taxation will best be covered by a p rogressive tax on prope rty. In this manne r the due s will be pa id withou t straitening or ruining an ybod y in the form of a percentage o f the a moun t of property. The rich must be aware that it is their duty to place a part of their superfluities at the d isposal of the State since the State guarantees them security of possession o f the rest of their property and the right of hone st gains, I say hone st, for the control over prope rty will do a way with robbe ry on a legal basis."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"53 This s ocial reform m ust come from abo ve, for the time is ripe for it – it is indispen sable a s a pledge of peace. The tax upon the poor man is a seed of revolution and works to the d etriment of the State which in hun ting after trifling is missing the b ig. Quite ap art from this, a tax on capitalists diminishes the growth of wealth in p rivate hand s in which we ha ve in these da ys concentrated it as a coun terpoise to the government strength o f the goyim – their State finan ces. A tax increasing in a percentage ratio to capital w ill give a much larger revenue than the present individua l or prope rty tax, which is useful to us now for the sole reason that it excites troub le an d discontent among the goyim. The force upo n which ou r king will rest consists in the e quilibrium and the guarantee o f pea ce, for the sake o f which things it is indispen sable that the capitalists shou ld yield up a portion of their incomes for the sake of the secure working of the machinery of the State. State need s must be paid b y those who will not feel the b urden an d have eno ugh to take from. Such a measure will destroy the h atred o f the poo r man for the rich, in whom he will see a necessary finan cial supp ort for the State, will see in h im the organizer of pea ce and well- being since he will see that it is the rich man who is paying the ne cessary mean s to attain these things. In order that payers of the edu cated classes shou ld n ot too much distress themselves over the ne w payments they will have full accounts given them of the destination of those payments, with the e xception of such sums as will be app ropriated for the need s of the throne and the a dministrative institutions. He who reigns will not have an y prope rties of his own on ce a ll in the State represents his patrimony, or else the one would be in contradiction to the other, the fact of holding private mean s would de stroy the right of property in the common po ssessions of all. Relatives of him who reigns, his heirs excepted, who will be maintained b y the resources of the State, must enter the ranks of servants of the State o f must work to obtain the right of prope rty; the privilege of royal blood must not serve for the spoiling of the treasury. Purchase, receipt of mone y or inhe ritance will be subject to the payment of a stamp progressive tax. Any transfer of prope rty, whether m one y of other, withou t eviden ce of payment of this tax which will be strictly registered b y names, will rende r the former holder liable to pa y interest on the tax from the moment of transfer of these sums up to the discovery of his evasion o r declaration of the transfer. Transfer documents must be presented weekly at the local treasury office with no tification of the name, surname and perm ane nt place o f residen ce o f the former and the ne w holder of the prope rty. This transfer with register of names must begin from a d efinite sum which e xceed s the o rdinary expen ses of buying and selling o f necessities, and these will be subject to pa yment only by a stamp impost of a definite pe rcentage of the un it. Just strike an estimate o f how many times such taxes as these will cover the revenue of the goyim States. The State e xchequer will have to maintain a d efinite complement of reserve sums, and all that is c ollected abo ve that complement must be returned into circulation. O n these sums will be o rganized pub lic works. The initiative in works of this kind, proceed ing from State sources, will bind the working class firm ly to the interests of the State an d to those who reign. From these same sums also a p art will be set aside as rewards of inventivene ss and produ ctivene ss.

The consequen ces of this c ircumstance are alread y sufficiently noticeab le. A court of accoun t will also be instituted b y us and in it the ruler will find at any moment a full accoun ting for State income an d expend iture, with the e xception of the current monthly accoun t, not yet made up, and that of the preceding month, which will not yet have been delivered. The one an d only person who will have no interest in robb ing the State is its owner, the ruler. This is why his persona l control will remove the po ssibility of leakages or extravagances. The representative function o f the ruler at receptions for the sake of etiquette, which ab sorbs so much invaluab le time, will be abo lished in o rder that the ruler may have time for control and consideration. His power will not then b e split up into fractiona l parts among time- serving favorites who surround the throne for its pomp an d splendo r, and are interested only in their own and n ot in the common interests of the State. Econo mic crises have been produ ced by us for the goyim by no other mean s than the withdrawal of mone y from circulation. Huge capitals have stagna ted, withdrawing mone y from States, which were constantly obliged to app ly to those some stagnan t capitals for loan s. These loan s burdene d the finan ces of the State with the pa yment of interest and made them the bon d slaves of these capitals. The concentration of indu stry in the hand s of capitalists out of the han ds of small masters has drained away all the juices of the peop les and with them also of the states.

We shall point out the n ecessity of reforms in consequen ce of the d isorderly darkness into which the goyim by their irregu larities have plunged the finan ces. The first irregularity, as we shall point out, consists in their beginning with d rawing up a single bu dget which year after year grows owing to the following cause: this budget is dragged o ut to half the year, then they demand a bu dget to pu t thing right, and this they expend in three months, after which they ask for a supp lementary budget, and all this end s with a liquidation bu dget. But, as the budget of the following year is drawn up in accordan ce with the sum of the total add ition, the annua l dep arture from the normal reaches"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"55 as much a s 50 p er cent in a year, and so the an nual budget is trebled in ten years. Thanks to such method s, allowed b y the carelessness of the goy States, their treasuries are empty. The period of loan s supe rvene s, and that has swallowed up remainde rs and brought all the goy States to ba nkruptcy. You unde rstand p erfectly that economic arrangements of this kind, which ha ve been suggested to the goyim by us, canno t be carried on b y us. Every kind of loan p roves infirmity in the State and a want of unde rstand ing of the rights of the State. Loan s hang like a sword of Damocles over the head s of rulers, who, instead of taking from their subjects by temporary tax, come b egging with o utstretched palm of our ban kers. Foreign loan s are leeches which there is no possibility of removing from the bod y of the State until they fall off of themselves or the State flings them off. But the goy States don no t tear them off; they go on in persisting in p utting more on to themselves s o that they must inevitably perish, drained b y v oluntary blood letting. What also indeed is, in substance, a loan , especially a foreign loan ? A loan is – a n issue o f government bills of exchange containing a p ercentage obligation comm ensurate to the sum of the loan capital. If the loan bea rs a charge o f 5 p er cent, then in twenty y ears the State vainly pays away in interest a sum equal to the loan b orrowed, in forty y ears it is paying a doub le sum, in sixty – treble, and a ll the while the de bt remains an unpa id de bt. From this calculation it is obvious that with an y form of taxation p er hea d the State is bailing out the last copp ers of the poo r taxpayers in o rder to settle a ccounts with wealthy foreigners, form whom it has borrowed mone y instead of collecting these copp ers for its own need s withou t the add itiona l interest. So long a s loan s were internal the goyim only shuffled their m one y from the po ckets of the poo r to those of the rich, but when we bou ght up the ne cessary person in order to transfer loan s into the e xternal sphe re all the wealth of States flowed into o ur cash-boxes and all the goyim began to pay us the tribute o f subjects. If the supe rficiality of goy kings on their throne s in regard to State a ffairs and the vena lity of ministers or the want of unde rstand ing of finan cial matters on the p art of other ruling persons have made their coun tries debtors to our treasuries to amoun ts quite impossible to pay, it has not been accomplished withou t on our part hea vy expen diture of troub le an d mone y Stagnation of mone y will not be a llowed by us and therefore there will be no State interest- bea ring pape r, except a on e per cent series, so that there will be no pa yment of interest to leeches that suck all the strength o ut of the State. The right to issue interest-bearing pap er will be given e xclusively to indu strial compan ies who will find no d ifficulty in pa ying interest out of profits, whereas the State doe s not make interest on borrowed mone y like these compan ies, for the State borrows to spend an d not to use in ope rations. Indu strial pape rs will be bo ught also b y the government which from being a s now a pa yer of tribute by loan ope rations will be transformed into a lende r of mone y at a profit. This measure will stop the stagn ation of mone y, parasitic profits and idlene ss, all of which were useful for us among the goyim so long as they were independen t but are no t desirable unde r our rule. How clear is the unde veloped po wer of thought of the purely brute b rains of the goyim , as expressed in the fact that they have been bo rrowing from us with pa yment of interest withou t ever thinking that all the same these very mone ys plus an add ition for payment of interest must be got by them from their own State po ckets in o rder to settle u p with u s. What could have been simpler than to take the mone y they wanted from their own peop le? But it is a p roof of the genius of our chosen mind that we ha ve contrived to present the matter of loan s to them in such a light that they have e ven seen in them an advantage for themselves."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"56 Our accounts, which we shall present when the time comes, in the light of centuries of experience gained b y experiments made b y us on the goy States, will be d istinguished by clearness and definitene ss and will show at a glance to a ll men the advantage o f our inno vations.

That they may be within the reach of all the price is determined a t from a hund red to a thou sand; and a discoun t is made for the earliest subscribers. Next day by artificial mean s the price of them goes up, the a lleged reason be ing that everyone is rushing to buy them. In a few days the treasury safes are as they say overflowing and there’s more mone y than they can d o with (why then take it?). The subscription, it is alleged, covers many times over the issue total of the loan ; in this lies the whole state e ffect – look you, they say, what confiden ce is s hown in the government’s bills of exchan ge. But when the comedy is played ou t there emerges the fact that a deb it and an e xceed ingly burden some deb it has bee n created. For the payment of interest it becomes necessary to have recourse to new loan s, which do no t swallow up bu t only add to the capital deb t. And when this c redit is exhau sted it becomes necessary by new taxes to cover, not the loan , but only the interest on it. These taxes are a deb it employed to cover a deb it. Later comes the time for conversions, but they diminish the payment of interest withou t covering the de bt, and b esides they cann ot be made withou t the consent of the lende rs; on announ cing a conversion a propo sal is made to return the mone y to those who a re not wil ling to convert their pap er. If everybod y expressed h is unwillingness and d emanded h is mone y back, the government would be ho oked on their own flies and would be foun d insolvent and unab le to pay the propo sed sums.

Nowadays, with e xternal loan s, these tricks canno t be played b y the goyim for they know that we shall demand a ll our m one ys back. In this way an a cknowledged ba nkruptcy will best prove to the various c oun tries the absence of any means between the interests of peop les of those who rule them. I beg you to concentrate your particular attention upo n this point and upo n the following: nowadays all internal loan s are consolidated by so-called flying loan s, that is, such as have terms of payment more or less nea r. These de bts c onsist of mone ys paid into the savings ban ks and reserve fund s. If left f or long at the d isposition of a government these fund s evapo rate in the pa yment of interest on foreign loan s, and are replaced b y the depo sit of equivalent amount of rentes. When we a scend the throne o f the world a ll these finan cial and similar shifts, as being not in accord with ou r interests, will be swept away so a s not to leave a trace, as also will be destroyed a ll mone y markets, since we shall not allow the p restige of our power to b e shaken by fluctuations of prices s et upon o ur values, which we shall announ ce b y law at the price which represents their full worth withou t any possibility of lowering or raising. (Raising gives the pretext for lowering, which indeed was where we made a beg inning in relation to the values of the goyim.) We shall replace the mone y markets by grand iose government credit institutions, the o bject of which will be to fix the price of indu strial values in a ccordan ce with government views. These institutions will be in a po sition to fling upon the market five hund red millions of indu strial pape r in one da y, or to but up for the same amount. In this way all indu strial unde rtakings will come into dependen ce upon us. You may imagine for yourselves what imm ense power we shall thereby secure for ourselves.

This c onfirmation will first and foremost be included in that in which to this day has rested the force o f conservatism by our learned elders of the condu ct of all the affairs of the world, in the d irecting of the ed ucation of thought of all humanity. Certain members of the seed of David will prepa re the kings and their heirs, selecting no t by right of heritage but be e minent capa cities, indu cting them into the most secret mysteries of the po litical, into schemes of government, but providing always that non e may come to knowledge of the secrets. The o bject of this mode of action is that all may know that government canno t be e ntrusted to those who ha ve no t bee n indu cted into the secret places of it art. To these persons only will be taught the practical app lication of the a fore-named p lans by comparison o f the experiences of many centuries, all the observations on the politico- econo mic moves and social sciences – in a word, all the spirit of laws which ha ve been unshakably established b y nature herself for the regulation o f the relations of humanity. Direct heirs will often be set aside from ascend ing the throne if in their time o f training they exhibit frivolity, softness and other qualities that are the ruin of authority, which rende r them incapab le of governing an d in themselves dangerous for kingly office. Only those who a re uncond itiona lly capab le for firm, even if it be to cruelty, direct rule will receive the reins of rule from our learned elders. In case o f falling sick with weakness of will or other form of incapa city, kings must by law hand o ver the reins to new and capab le hand s.

CH AP TER 6 JEWISH ANTI-SE MITISM Well, how do you feel, after read ing this? Can you be lieve what you just read ? Can you see things happe n in modern times, as described in these 24 Protocols ? I can hea r some reade rs saying: “This is not true, the Protocols are n ot of Jewish o rigin an d have been made u p by some anti-Semites.” Well, to those “smart one s” I will show up two mistakes in their reasoning: 1. It is an absolute fact that the Protocols are of Jewish o rigin. The proof of this c an be found in on e o f the o ldest books in the world, which ha s bee n sold many millions of times and canno t be taken away from the public anymore – the Jewish TALMUD !!! 2 Semitism or anti-Semitism and the Jews have a lmost nothing in common! “What? What is this guy talking about?” some peop le are thinking imm ediately. Again, don ’t just swallow w hat the (mostly Jewish) m ass-m edia is telling you. Get yourself some h istory books and the Encyclopaed ia Juda ica and get your knowledge yourself through your own research. Here I will just give you some short phrases, Des Griffin had don e tremend ous research for his book Anti-Semitism and the Babylonian Conne ction . As a result of an u nrelenting a valanche of Zionist propaganda , the vast majority of G ermans as well as Americans have been misled into be lieving that the word Semite refers almost"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"61 exclusively to the p eople who toda y are known a s J ews. In fact few thing could b e further from the truth! Interestingly, the words Semite, Semitism and anti-Semitism do not even appea r in the 1828 edition of Noah Webster’s American Dictiona ry of the English Language . They were coined only toward the end of the last century. So, who a re the Semites? The Semites are, according to the highly authoritative Oxford Universal Di ctiona ry , 1944 (p. 1838 ) the peop le be longing to the race o f mankind which include s most of the peop les mentioned in Genesis 10 as descended from Shem, son o f Noah , as the Arabs, Hebrews, Assyrians, and Aramean s, and speaking a Semitic language as their native tongue. Well, most peop le in the world would an swer the question whether the mode rn Jew is of Hebrew or Semitic origin with a clear “yes”! False! This is simply not true. The Jews in mode rn society have no thing to do with the ancient Hebrews of biblical times. For decade s we ne ver thou ght of even questioning this basic assumption. Actually, it is an historical fact that some 9 5 percent of modern Jewry are n ot of Semitic stock. They are of Turkish stock – the so-called Khazars. “The Khazars c ame not from Jordan , but from the Volga, not from Canaan , but from the Caucasus. G ene tically they are more related to the Hun, Uigur and Magyar than to the seed of Abraham, Isaac and Jakob. The story of the Khazar Empire, as it slowly emerges from the pa st, begins to look like the most cruel hoax that history has ever perpetrated.” (Arthur Koestler, The Thirteen th Tribe ). Let me give you some quick overview of the h istory of the Khazars. “The Jews of our times fall into two main d ivisions: Sepha rdim and Ashkena zim. The Sepha rdim are the d escendan ts of the Jews who since an tiquity have lived in Spain (Hebrew: Shepa rd) until they were e xpelled a t the end of the fifteen th century. In the 1960 s, the n umber of Sepha rdim was estimated at 500 ,000. The Ashkena zim or Khazar Jews as the same time numbered abou t 11 million.” ( The Thirteen th Tribe , p.181 ) The Jewish Encyc lopaed ia tells us abo ut the Khazars (spelling varies) “Chazars: A peop le of Turkish origin whose life an d history are interwoven with the very beginning of the history of the Jews in Russia...driven on b y the n omadic tribes of the steppe s and by their own de sire for plude r and revenge. In the second ha lf of the sixth century the Chazars moved westwards... the kingdom of the Chazars was firmly established in most of southern Russia long before the foun dation of the Russian monarchy by the Vangarians (855 AD). At this time the kingdom of the Chazars s tood at the he ight of its power and was c onstantly at war. At the end o f the eighth century...the chagan (king) of the Chazars and h is grandee s, together with a large number of his heathen peop le, embraced the Jewish religion. (Having the Christians to their left and the Muslims to their right they were a sked to join e ither one o f those religions, but the chagan out of protest chose the Jewish religion). The Jewish popu lation of the entire domain o f the Chazars, in the period between the seventh an d eighth century, must have been substantial. Abou t the ninth century it appe ars as if all the Chazars were Jews and that they had bee n converted to Juda ism only a short time before. It was one of the successors of Bulan n amed Obad iah, who regene rated the kingdom and strengthened the Jewish religion. “He invited Jewish scholars to settle in his dominion and founded synagogue s and schoo ls. The peop le were instructed in the Bible, Mishnah and the Talmud and the d ivine service of the ha zzanim... In their writings the Chazars used the Hebrew letters... the Chazar language predo minated... “The Russian Varangians established themselves at Kiev... until the final conquest of the Chazars by the Russians after a h ard fight. Four years later the Russians conquered all the Chazarian territory east of the Azov river. Many members of the Chazarian royal family"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"62 emigrated to Spain... Some went to Hungary, but the g reat mass of the peop le remained in their native coun try” ( Jewish Encyclopaed ia , Volume IV, article o n Chazars, pp. 1-5). After Obad iah came a long succession of chagans (kings), for according to a funda mental law of the state only Jewish rulers were pe rmitted to a scend to the throne. So we glean from strictly Jewish sources that the vast majority of present day Jews c ann ot claim to be de scendan ts of the original H ebrews, and possibly heirs to Palestine. Because of that fact, the term “ anti-Semitism” doe s not refer to modern Jews. Benjamin Freed man, a Jew w ho was on a first name basis with most of the top Zionists in the 30s and 40s, puts his finger firm ly on the true purpose beh ind the use of the term “anti-Semitism” . He d eclares that; “it should be e liminated from the English language”. “Anti-Semitism” serves only one purpose toda y; it is used as a smear word. When so-called Jews feel that anyone oppo ses any of their objectives, they discredit their victims by app lying the word “anti-Semite” or “anti- Semitic” through a ll the channe ls they have a t their comm and and und er their control”. ( Facts are Facts , Benjamin Freed man, p.73). Also what happened in the Third Reich is not necessarily related to “anti-Semitism” , it had to do with “anti-Khazarism” and “anti-Talmudism” ( especially the “Mosaic Law”) which will be answered correctly by any SS -m ember (if still alive). I will give you some d irection through all these terms pretty soon . The most widely known and po werful Khazar family is the Rothschild family, who a re na med after the red shield that is the symbol of the Khazars. Does this make sense? It definitely will do so e ven more by the end of this book. Just keep in mind that, because the mode rn Jews are not of Hebrew origin, they never had and ne ver will have a right for claiming the land o f Palestine. The state o f Israel is absolutely illegal, even if the Jews would ha ve some Hebrew origin. But you will read more to this in the later chap ters. To bring it down to the po int: the race with the most “anti-Semitic” attitude is probab ly the mode rn Jew himself. Why? Because they hate an d fight the Arabs who really are of Semitic stock whene ver and wherever they can!!! Therefore the “Arabs” are “anti-Khazar” or “anti-Jewish” and the Jews are the on es who a re “anti-Semitic”! Think abo ut it! Sometimes the truth is v ery uncomfortable.

You don ’t believe this? Well, ask a rabb i. I did and got the answer: “Of course! We are the chosen peop le! You are the goy (singular of goyim ).” It doe sn’t mean that every Jew is believing in the Talmud and the Mosaic Law, the same as not every child of Christian p arents believes in Christianity.

The Templar degrees were introdu ced into the “Free Observance” system of Masonry, which mean t that members had to p ledge strict obed ience to those o f a h igher rank. The lead er, who was c alled “The Unknown Supe rior” and carried the title “Knight of the Red Feather”, was true to the Scottish Rite an d then ce to the Stuarts. Abou t one decade after the invitation of FREDERICK THE GREA T the “Strict O bservance” and its “Scottish Rite” was adop ted by almost all the German Freemasonry. Frede rick made eno rmous profits from the conflicts to which the “Scottish Freemasonry” had contributed. His goal was the expan sion of Prussia an d therefore he suppo rted the JACOBITES against the HANOVE RIANS, also in 174 5 during the great invasion of England . Afterwards he allied h imself with England an d profited from their difficulties by lend ing them German soldiers. (Appa rently he ha d read Niccolo Macchiavelli, too!) This was one of the biggest swindles in the h istory of Europe : a small group of G erman princes overthrows the English throne and p uts a Hano verian there. Then they use their influen ce to have England engaged in wars and proceed to empty the English treasury by lend ing them mercena ries. The indeb tedne ss again he lped the Jewish ba nkers and thus the Illuminati on their way to take o ver the world. CH AP TER 9 THE BAVA RIAN ILLUMINATI O F ADAM WEISHAUPT ADAM WEISHAUPT received h is edu cation in a Jesuit mona stery and finally became a professor of the canon . Over the years he found problems with the Catholic views and became the persona l stude nt of the Jewish ph ilosophe r Mende lssohn who converted h im to gnosticism. In 177 0 Weishau pt was appa rently contacted by the recently convened mone ylende rs (Rothschild) to foun d, on their beha lf, t he “SE CR ET ORD ER OF THE BAVA RIAN ILLUMINATI” at Ingolstadt. A short explana tion: Weishau pt’s Bavarian Illuminati are not to be confused with the “ILLUMINATI”, the g roup we have looked at so far. The TRU E Illuminati had – as mentioned b efore – infiltrated the “BROTHERH OO D OF THE S NAKE ” in Mesopo tamia and they never appea r unde r their name or persona lly and in pub lic. In this book we u se the name Illuminati because it has become accepted a mong insiders to mean this group o f peop le dea ling in b ackgroun d. Adam Weishau pt just used the same name for his order whose ob jectives were similar to those of the Illuminati (perhap s to confound o nce more future researchers by a group thus named that appea rs in pub lic). To a void confusion I will call Weishaup t’s group “Bavarian Illuminati”. The Bavarian Illuminati were o rganized a s circles within circles (onion-like). When initiates had p roven their capa city for keep ing secrets, they were a ccepted into an inne r circle with yet deepe r secrets. Only those in the inne rmost circle knew abou t the true intentions of the Bavarian Illuminati. Members of the lower degrees were told that there were no h igher"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"68 deg rees, and the identity of the Grand Masters was not revealed, as in the “Strict Observance”. The Bavarian Illuminati were subd ivided into thirteen d egrees to the thirteen steps of the Illuminati pyramid on the U.S. one -dollar bill. The system copied the spying and informing of the Jesuits to test members who had reached the title of “Patriarch” for weaknesses. This politics allowed the o rder to place the Patriarchs in those p ositions where their talents c ould be st be used. Denou ncing was also one of their tactics, to en sure that no Patriarch would go a gainst the order. Weishau pt succeede d in winning the b est and brightest head s in h igh finan ce, indu stry, edu cation an d literature for the Bavarian Illuminati. He u sed bribery by mone y and by sex to gain control over those a lread y in very high positions. Once h e had achieved this, Weishaup t used extortion to ensure that he retained control over these unfortuna te lead ing persona lities. The Bavarian Illuminati then started to ha ve ade pts (higher degrees) advise government peop le, of course, beh ind the scene s. These experts knew to advise the po liticians in such a way that they ado pted a form of politics engineered so cleverly that the ad vised pe rsons thought they themselves had gotten these idea s. The reason given for the existence of the Bavarian Illuminati was the eradication of the dire circumstances in society to lead man back to his natural and happ y state. Since this meant to o vercome b oth the Mona rchy and the Church they had created themselves dangerous adversaries. And on ce more it turned out that secrecy was the most important institution of the order. A document that became known a s THE NEW TES TAMENT OF SA TAN shows what Weishau pt’s Illuminati ideo logy was meant to b e. The document had bee n closely guarded by the Bavarian Illuminati, and I am using it here because many peop le still doub t that the Protocols of the Elders of Zion are genu ine. Perhap s these reade rs find it easier to a ccept that plan and the principle of action if the word “Jew” doe s not appe ar. The do cument got only known when in 1875 a courier to Paris was s truck by lightning an d the information o f a worldwide conspiracy he had carried was app rehended an d revealed to the pub lic. Therein it is stated: “ that the first secret of guiding peop le is the control of pub lic opinion b y sowing d iscord, doub t and contradictory v iews until peop le can no longe r find their way in this c onfusion an d are convinced that it was better not to h ave a persona l opinion in na tiona l law. Passions have to fanne d in the peop le an d inane d irty and abho rrent writings produ ced. It is further the task of the press to show up the inab ility of the no n-illumined in a ll matters of state and religious life. The second secret is to carry the weaknesses of the peop le, all the bad hab its, passions and mistakes to e xtremes until they no longe r unde rstand each other. The po wer of the persona lity has to be fough t, as there is nothing more dang erous. If it is endo wed with creative spiritual forces, it can effect more than millions of peop le. All peop les s hall be worn d own by envy, hatred, quarrels and wars, by deprivation, hunge r and the spread ing of epidemics (e.g. AIDS ) until they s ee no other solution than to submit completely to the rule of the Illuminati. If a state is exhausted by inner radical change s or because of civil war has fallen und er the control of external enemies, then it is definitely doomed and so in ou r power. Peop le will get used to taking illusion a t face value, to be content with supe rficialities, they chase on ly after pleasure, to exhau st themselves in their eternal obsession with what’s new and finally to follow the Illuminati which will be a scertained by paying the masses well for their obed ience and their attention. Through the d emoralization o f society shall peop le lose their faith in God . By working specifically with the spoken and the written word the masses shall be led according to the wishes of the Illuminati."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"69 With visual instructions the peop le have to b e stopped from thinking for themselves and made to u se any existing mental powers for the shado w-boxing of hollow rhetoric.

The conspirators had recognized the strength and the influen ce o f the e xisting Freemason lodges and started no w – following the p lan – to infiltrate these and to take control (No.11 of the Protocols ). The lodges that had bee n infiltrated were then called “THE LODGES OF THE GRAND ORIENT”. A famous French orator, the MARQUIS DE MIRABEA U, became hea vily indeb ted be cause of his extravagant lifestyle and was c ontacted on Weishaup t’s order by the Jewish mone ylende rs. Moses Mende lssohn then introdu ced Mirabeau to the wife of the Jew HERZ and it ensued that she got to see more o f Mirabeau than of her own hu sband . Now Mirabeau was in a situation where he was, die to e xtortion an d his debts, und er total control of the Bavarian Illuminati. Next, he was given the task of convincing the DUC D’ ORLEA NS who was Grand Master of the French Freemasons, to change the BLUE LODGES into “LODGES OF THE GRAND ORIENT”. [H: Surely, you d idn’t have the delusion that someho w threats, blackmail and conspiracy are things new!] In 177 3 Mirabeau introdu ced the Duc D’Orlean and Talleyrand to Weishaup t who then initiated them into the “Grand Orient” Freemasonry. When in May 1776 , [H: Look again at that date and then look at your dollar bill.] the American Declaration of Independen ce was s igned, Adam Weishau pt fulfilled h is well- considered p lan an d introduced the Bavarian Illuminati OFF ICIALLY. This date is then ce falsely given a s the date o f their found ing. The most important years, though, were the six years prior to the o fficial introdu ction. Among the members of the order were Johan n Wolfgang von Goethe, Duke Darl August von Weimar, Duke Ferdinand von Braunchweig, Baron von Dahlberg (Postmaster General of Thurn an d Taxis), Baron von Knigge and many others. In 177 7 Weishau pt was initiated into the Freemason lodge “THEODORE OF GO OD COUNC IL” in Munich and soon ha d the whole lodge infiltrated. On July 16, 1782 the union be tween the FREE MAS ONS and the BAVA RIAN ILLUMINATI was s ealed in Wilhelmsbad. This pact united abo ut 3,000,000 members of the lead ing secret societies. An agreement reached at the congress in Wilhelmsbad a llowed the initiation of Jews, who a t that time had on ly limited rights, into the lodges. As the ROTHSCH ILDS controlled the Bavarian Illuminati, they now had d irect influen ce o n other important secret lodges. Very little of what had bee n decided at that conference ever reached the pub lic s ince all attend ing were vowed to complete secrecy. The COMTE DE VIRIEU, on of the Freemasons attend ing, was asked whether he could divulge some o f the resolution. He said: “I will not confide them to you.

CH AP TER 10 THE B ATTLE OF WATERLOO This was the biggest coup o f the ROTHSCH ILD family which a t that time alread y had bu ilt up a p erfect espiona ge and courier network all across Europe . On June 20, 181 5 one of their couriers, having just come from the b attlefield, hande d NATHAN R OTHSCH ILD the information of France’s defeat. Nathan ha stily returned to the London stock exchange an d there sold all his holdings of the “English Consul” stock, thus feigning knowledge of England ha ving lost the b attle. The rumor spread so that most other stockholders were selling their holdings in a pan ic of losing a ll. After a few hou rs the value of “English Consul” had fallen to five cents on the dollar, so Nathan proceede d to but all the stock for that ludicrous price. A short while later the official news of England ’s victory reached Londo n. The value of “English Consul” shot within second s higher than the original price and later continued to climb. Napo leon had had h is Waterloo, and Nathan ha d gained control of the English e cono my. Overnight the a lread y gigan tic wealth of the Rothschilds had multiplied more than twenty fold. The French had , after their defeat, obvious difficulties to regain strength and so, in 181 7, they signed a sizeab le credit agreement with the French OUVA RD bank and the BA RING BROTHERS from Londo n. But not with the Rothschilds. And when the following year France neede d a further loan , they again b ypassed Rothschild.

That’s the reason why the Tibetans always s uppo rted Germ any and became the secret found ers of the Third Reich. In this prophe cy, as well as in the proph ecy of Jesus (which you will find in the chap ter abo ut the Thule Society), it is said that the new “Licht- Reich” (realm of light) will emerge from Germ any and therefore the po wer of the Jews will be taken a way from them. (Compare Matthew 21:43, where Jesus addressed the JEWS: “Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of G od will be taken away from you and given to a peop le who will produ ce its fruit.”) It was s aid that a child would be bo rn that would un ite a ll Europe withou t a war, but through love.

This c hild was born on the day of Michae l, the 29 th of September 1812 , in Karlsruhe a s the son of Grand Duke Karl and h is wife, Stephan ie d e Beauha rnais, the ado pted da ughter of Napo leon , and therefore was the successor to the throne o f the House o f Baden – the GERMAN EMPEROR!!! But the Illuminati Freemasons and the Black Nobility knew abou t him and had to make this child d isappea r. The French Grand Orient Lodge o f Freemasons kidnappe d the boy, but they couldn’t just murder him. If they would ha ve killed the ph ysical bod y, the vehicle o f this soul, the soul would simply have chosen ano ther bod y, maybe on e year later, and would have taken the throne anyway. So they had to keep this s oul trapped in the bod y and prevent it from taking on its task. Therefore, the Freemasons kept the child somewhere in norm al conditions until the age of two and a ha lf, when the child showed its first signs of memory (that’s the time when the soul gets fixed within the ph ysical bod y). Then the Masons had the child p ut in a metal cage in a cellar, withou t any light at all, from two and a half until fifteen (twelve and a ha lf years!). But this wasn’t eno ugh torture yet: The cage was so small that the boy could ne ither stretch his legs out nor stand up, and therefore h is limbs grew at angles. As y ou will see later, this is a typical Masonic ritual. Freemasons speak in symbols, and e very form of pun ishment has its s ymbols to show the other Masons what the person ha s bee n pun ished for. So, in this case they chose the square which is one of the Masonic s ymbols, compass and square. After twelve and a ha lf years of living in this cage withou t any light, with just water and bread , the Freemasons thought that they had won and taught the child forty spoken words and ha w to write the na me Kaspar Hauser. They left t he child on the streets in the middle of Nuremberg an d thought that he would be ab solutely lost. First Kaspar was put in p rison for a few hou rs because h e could n ot speak, was not used to light, had ne ver consciously seen a human being, could n ot walk right – he just had a very unu sual beha vior. But the chief of police imm ediately saw that this boy was not a criminal at all, because h e was a very beau tiful child, and h e saw that something unu sual had"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"73 happened to him. So Kaspar was given to a family of a friend o f the chief of police, who took on Kaspas as their own child. But then things s tarted to happe n. This c hild was very unu sual. After half a year Kaspar could speak pretty well, and he started to draw. He was a very correct child, intensely tidy, he wore the most prope r clothing, everything in h is room had its prope r place. He h ad a brilliant memory they had ne ver seen in ano ther child; he remembered e very word that had been said b y every person h e had met, knew the clothing they had worn that day. But he had e ven more phen omena to show. Besides being such a bea utiful boy he was extremely telepa thic. He knew w hat other peop le thought of, knew w ho the pe rson was beh ind h is back, 450 feet away, and what he was doing; he saw at night better than du ring the day, but most important was his being. He was s uch a gentle, loving being that everybod y who met him just had to like h im and became a different person. So he be came known a s the “m iracle child of Europe ”, and peop le from all over came to see him. Then, at the age o f eighteen, he started to write this first biograph y (imagine this, after all he could no t speak nor write n or do much e lse at fifteen). Imagine a norm al child be ing imprisoned for twelve and a ha lf years withou t any light. So the Grand Orient Freemasons saw that this c hild was too powerful and that it would take him probab ly just another few months to realize who he really was and that he finally would take on h is title an yway. So they had one of their members, Lord Stanhop e, get into Kaspar Hauser’s life. Stanhope took him away from his ado ptive pa rents and got him to the teacher Meyer in Ansbach who was very cruel to him. There he was taught to lie an d talk abou t other peop le. But Kaspar was s till bothering the Illuminati, so, on the 17 th of O ctobe r 1829 , they tried to kill him the first time in a kosher way, by cutting his throat, another type of ritual murder the Freemasons use which they have adop ted from the Jews. But the a ssassin d idn’t cut the throat, he cut the forehead , probab ly because it was too dark. Kaspar’s reaction the ne xt day was forgivene ss for the assassin. He was not even a ngry at him. But then, on the 14 th of December 1833 , the Masons were successful. Kaspar was s tabbe d with a knife three times while he was walking ou t in the fields, and d ied three da ys later on the e vening of the 17 th . But the most important inciden t is that on h is dea thbe d Kaspar forgave h is murderer, as Jesus on the cross had forgiven h is murderers (actually the same group o f peop le). This s hows us who Kaspar Hauser really was – b y his deed s we no w know him. Kaspar’s task was to unite Europe in pea ce, to bring forth a d ifferent “New World Order”, and o rder of love and respect. So, again the Illuminati had been successful with their plan, but just on the surface. The same that happene d through of Jesus, happene d a gain through the death of Kaspar Hauser, and it affected the whole world, even if one can’t recognize it immediately. One canno t kill a spiritual master and just think “that’s that”! CH AP TER 12 THE FREE MAS ONS IN AMERICA After the ROSICRUC IANS had founded their first colony in 1694 in what toda y is Penn sylvania, the Freemasons proceeded to e stablish their first lodges around 1730 , with the consent of the Mother Grand Lodge in England. The found ing of the United States of America is the result of the secret work by Freemasons over hund reds of years. The American War of Independen ce had bee n organized and fought by Freemasons, and the Constitution of the U.S. had bee n penned an d signed b y Freemasons. About one third o f the American Presiden ts were Freemasons, and they are well represented in Congress, both in the Senate an d in the United States Representatives. The Great seal of the United States with the Pyramid with the all-Seeing Eye on the reverse"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"74 side, the Phoen ix (which in 1841 was replaced b y the Bald Eagle) on the obverse an d the original Star-Spangled Bann er with 13 stripes and 13 stars are all old an d important Freemason symbols, which, although they had bee n designed o n beha lf of the ROTHSCH ILDS and p ut in p lace by WEISHAUPT, in their symbolism hark back to ancient Egypt. The design of the Illuminati-dollar pyramid is by Phillip Rothschild, as his lover Ayn Rand d ivulged in he r boo k “Atlas Shrugged”. After the War of Independen ce was over, the American Masonic lodges s egregated from the English Mother Grand Lodge an d created their proper American Grand Lodge . This comprised the York Rite with ten degrees (the tenth is a Templar degree) and the Scottish Rite with thirty-three. Most Freemasons think that there are n o degrees higher than the thirty-third, but the members of that degree are later initiated into the Illuminati degrees (See No. 11 of the Protocols). All “Grand Orient” lodges in Europe were a lread y perfectly controlled b y the Bavarian Illuminati. The Freemasons of America a t this time were n ot infected by Weishaup t’s “Illuminism”. This only happened later. Remarks on Toda y’s Situation: One ha s to und erstand that perhap s 90% of all the organized Freemasons toda y have no t the least idea what their highest leade rs who a re linked to the Illuminati are actually up to. Like other organizations the Freemasons are used a s a b lind to further spread the influen ce of the Illuminati. Lyndon La Rouche de scribes them as follows: “Outwardly the local Freemason lodges appea r as what they mostly do. They are stag group s following certain charitable a ims and use a secret hand shake an d other secret society hocus-pocus. But getting together they think they can set themselves up a s important local figures. It is good for business, good for the career. The wives, too, have thus the right social environment and p erhap s get to hea r the newest gossip from the neighbo rhoo d. But at the top things are completely different. The simple lodge brother has no idea what happen s at the top...” (NEUE S OLIDARITAT, March 10 ,199 3). It is also interesting to note that while Germ an Freemasons from Prussia en tered the service of America, other Germ an Freemasons supp orted England and thereby made fantastic profits. Almost 30,000 soldiers from six German states, more than ha lf from Hesse-Hanau , were loaned to the English Government. In many battles there were more German than English soldiers fighting in the British army against the Americans. In the b attle of Trenton for instance, there were on ly Germans fighting. How abou t the finan cial state of the United States of America? The U.S. President THOMAS JEFF ERSON and BE NJAMIN FRANKLIN were inimical to the establishment of a private central bank for the control of the U.S. currency. After Franklin’s dea th in 179 0 the Rothschild agents got ALEXAND ER H AMILTON appo inted as s ecretary of the treasury. In 1791 h e created the “FIRST NATIONAL BA NK OF THE UN ITED STATES ”, the first central bank fashioned after the “Bank of England ” and controlled b y the Rothschilds. In 181 1, when the contract of the ba nk with the U.S. lapsed, the American e conomy was s o destabilized that the contract was not rene wed for five years. The Rothschilds then u sed their influen ce in the British Parliament to ha ve England reclaim her colonies in America. This led to the 1812 -181 5 war. The war again p ut the U.S. so much in de bt that they had to ask the bankers once more for loan s (i.e. the central bank). In 183 6, und er Presiden t Andrew Jackson, the central bank was again d isapp roved, but it got the concession ba ck in 186 3 and in 1913 became the “Federal R eserve Bank”, today’s central bank of the U.S. (more details will follow)."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"75 After the death of Mayer Amschel in 181 2, Nathan ha d custody of the family’s fortune. In this position h e opene d the NATHAN MAYE R R OTHSCH ILD & SONS BA NK in London , with b ranches in Vienna , Paris and Berlin. This bank dea lt in stocks and loan s, it insured government, it managed and controlled o ther ban ks, railroad s, steel plants, arms produ ctions and many more. In America it was represented b y KUHN LOEB & CO., by J.P. MORGAN & CO. and by AUGUST BE LMONT & CO. Nathan kept this position in the family clan un til he was poisoned at a family gathering in 1836 . The reason for the meeting was the marriage o f his s o L IONEL ROTHSCH ILD. Some say that Nathan was executed b ecause h e had he lped h imself to some of the family fortune . His s on L IONEL was very successful as the new boss of N.M. ROTHSCH ILD & SONS and eventually became a Member of Parliament. Jakob (James) Rothschild from the Paris branch was c ustodian o f the family fortune from 1836 to 1868 . He had bee n next in line after Nathan . The Rothschilds together with the Bavarian Illuminati represented the finan cial power beh ind Zionism and later communism and they had started and finan ced many revolutions and wars. For instance, did Rothschilds finan ce b oth sides of the Civil War in the U.S. between 1861 - 1865? From December 1860 to May 1861 e leven states whose e conomy depended o n slavery (the Southern states) declared they wanted to leave the Union an d form ed the “Confede rate States”. In April 1861 this led to the secession war against the remaining Union states in the n orth. The reasons lead ing to this civil war were a lmost completely due to the a ctions and provocations of ROTHSCH ILD AGENTS. O ne of those troublemakers was GEORGE BICKLEY , who had founde d the “KNIGHTS OF THE GOLDEN C IRC LE”. The House of Rothschild then had Bickley and h is k nights extol the d isadvantages of the Union for the Confederate States. In the remaining Union states the Rothschilds had J.P. Morgan and August Belmont praise the advantages of the Union. The London Rothschild ba nk finan ced the North, the Paris bank the South. A fantastic business for the Rothschilds. If you finan ce b oth sides and suppo rt the arm s as well, you can bu t win. Here, the Americans were the only losers, both the North an d the South (Machiavelli send s his regards). It happened though that Presiden t Lincoln saw through this and refused to pay the Rothschilds’ imm ense interests. He then asked Congress to have the Greenba ck dollars made in order to pay the Union troop s. This of course ran contrary to the p lans of the Rothschilds and led to them having L incoln murdered b y their agent JOHN WILKES BOO TH on April 14, 1865 . John W. Booth was later freed from jail by the Knights of the Golden Circle an d spent the rest of his life quite comfortably in England , thanks to the hand some payment by Rothschild. After Lincoln’s dea th the greenbacks were withdrawn and later bought in at ridiculous price by the central bankers Morgan, Belmont and Rothschild.

Part of the manifesto came from their m inds, but the largest section was the ideo logy of the"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"76 “League of the Just” and other French secret societies who took a revolutiona ry stance towards France. Gary Allen writes: “In actual fact the ‘Communist Manifesto’ w as in circulation for many y ears before Marx’s name was widely enou gh recognized to e stablish h is authorship for this revolutiona ry handboo k. All Karl Marx really did was to upd ate or codify the very same revolutiona ry plans and p rinciples s et down seventy y ears earlier by Adam Weishaup t, the founde r of the Order of Illuminati in Bavaria. (None Dare Call It Conspiracy). The “fight against capitalism” could no w proceed. Thanks to his intellectual prowess Marx succeeded in changing the image o f the league which in 1847 changed its name to “COMMUN IST LEA GUE”. This now shows c learly how the Bavarian Illuminati created in England an d in America “capitalist” systems and on the other han d “anti-capitalist”, i.e. “communist”, systems thus produ ced an d to keep humanity in constant discord an d therefrom confusion. CH AP TER 14 THE P LAN FOR A WORLD GO VE RN MENT WEISHAUPT died in 183 0 at the a ge of eighty-two. In 183 4 GUISEPPE MAZZ INI assumed leade rship of the Bavarian Illuminati and held this position u ntil his death In 187 2. While h e was lead ing the order of the Bavarian Illuminati, Mazzini corresponde d with the Satanist ALBE RT PIKE , the “SOVE REIGN GRAND C OMMAND ER OF THE ANC IENT AND ACC EP TED SCOTTISH RITE OF F REE MAS ONR Y”, of the Southern Jurisdiction of the U.S. and later the founde r of the “KU KLUX K LAN”. Mazzini had na med Pike lead er of ope rations of the Bavarian Illuminati in the U.S. As top illuminists the two worked together. Pike took on the theo soph ical aspects of their ope rations, Mazzini the po litical one s. When the Masonic Lod ges of the Grand Orient got into d isrepute in Europe du e to the revolutiona ry activities of Mazzini, the latter presented Pike with a p lan of gen ius. In a letter to Pike, dated Janu ary 22, 1870 , Mazzini wrote: “We must allow all of the federations to continue just as they are, with their systems, their central authorities and their diverse modes of corresponden ce b etween h igh g rade s of the same rite, organized a s they are a t present, but we must create a super rite, which will remain u nknown, to which we will call those Masons of high d egree whom we shall select. With regard to our brothers in Masonry, these men must be pledged to the strictest secrecy, Through this s upreme rite, we will govern a ll Freemasonry which will become the one internationa l center, the more po werful because its direction will be un known.” (Occult Theo cracy, Lad y Queenbo rough, and None Dare Call It Conspiracy, Gary Allen). Appa rently this is the elite of the 33 rd degree o f the Scottish Rite. The Ideo logy of this deg ree is given in the ne xt chapter. In a letter of August 15, 1871 PIKE showed the Illuminati leade r Mazzini in an ou tline ho w to conquer the world with three world wars, the way to e stablish “THE NEW WORLD ORD ER”. The FIRST WORLD WAR shou ld be staged to bring Czarist Russia unde r the control of the Bavarian Illuminati. Russia shou ld then b e used as a “bogey man” to further the aims of the Bavarian Illuminati world-wide. The SE COND WORLD WAR shou ld b e started b y manipulating the differences between the German n ationa lists and the Political Zionists. This was to result in an e xpan sion of Russian influen ce and the e stablishment of a State of Israel In Palestine. The THIRD WORLD WAR was planned to result from the d ifferences stirred u p by Illuminati agents between the Zionists and the Arabs. The conflict was planned to span the world."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"77 It is also p art of the Third World to set Nihilists and Atheists against one an other to provoke a social reversal by hitherto unknown savagery and brutality. After the destruction of Christianity and Atheism one would show men the true “Luciferian Doctrine” and thereby kill two b irds with one stone . Remarks to Toda y’s Situation (by the a uthor): Having Russia a s the boge y man (concept of the en emy) the Western nations s hou ld be forced into SUPRANATIONAL alliances they would no t have en tered b y themselves (NATO, UN ). Also ha ving the former Russian empire as the en emy of the world tremendou sly helped internationa l arm s dea ls, which a gain profited the internationa l bankers. This s hows us that beh ind the Second World War there is yet a scena rio completely DIFF ERENT from what the HISTORY BOOK tell us. CH AP TER 15 THE K NIGHTS OF THE KU KLUX K LAN Here we ha ve to dea l again with ALBE RT PIKE and the “Scottish Rite” of the Freemasons. Officially, the Masonic order of the “Scottish Rite” started in 180 1 in the U.S. from a group o f Tory followers. These however had cultivated an ti-Christian an d Satanic practices before. Since abou t 184 0 the o rgan izationa l structure o f the American Freemasons was unde r the severe supe rvision of the “Scottish Rite”. The latter bestows initiation d egrees up to the 33 rd deg ree. It is divided into a Southern Jurisdiction in Arkansas and a northern jurisdiction in Boston. As an instrument of strategy for the CR OWN (explained in the next chapter), the “Scottish Rite” condu cted in the middle of the last century an incessant offensive of murder and racist terror against the U.S. and the ne ighboring states. The most important inciden ces were the American occupa tion of Mexico du ring the Mexican War (1846 -184 8), the rebe llion of the slave-holders, i.e. the Civil War (1861 -186 5) and the crusade of the Ku Klux Klan a gainst the rebu ilding of the Southern States (1867 -187 0). The “KNIGHTS OF THE GO LDEN C IRC LE” founde d by George Bickley appea red here for the first time, in Cincinna ti, unde r the leade rship of KILIANEN VA N R ENSSE LAE RS. The “Golden Circle” was to establish a new empire o f slavery with Cuba a s its c enter. It was their objective to kill the hated Catholic Hispan ics in order to replace them with b lack s laves fresh from Africa. This was the first “North American Free Trade Treaty”. The seal of the “KNIGHTS OF THE GO LDEN CIRC LE” was iden tical to that of the “KNIGHTS OF MALTA”, the Maltese Cross. The “Knights of the Golden Circle” eventually disappea red. In 186 7 Albert Pike foun ded in Nashville the “ORD ER OF THE K NIGHTS OF THE K U KLUX KLAN” (GREEK KYK LOS = CIRC LE), he was the “Great Dragon” and thus their leade r. So here they were a gain, the “Knights of the Golden Circle”. The KKK also u ses the Maltese Cross as its emblem and it is led by prominent Freemasons. If one looks at the racist and inhu man goals of the KKK and from these dedu cts the “inner being” of its found er and its members, then one h as to question whether one writes abo ut members of the human species at all. The KKK uses force to keep their voting rights from black c itizens, to disallowing them to own a rms, to d iscriminate against schoo ls teaching black c hildren an d to lower the standa rd o f living of blacks to a level that equals that of slavery. The interesting thing is that nowada ys the KKK is almost totally finan ced by the MOSSA D (The Israeli secret service). In the “Jewish” community the independen t order “B”NAI B”RITH” was established in 1843 . The “B’nai B’rith”, a Zionist secret lodge, is c oun ted among the Masonic lodges. The term “B’nai B’rith” m ean s “Sons of the Alliance”. It claims the lead ership of world Juda ism. Althou gh most lodges of this order were in the North o f the U.S., the “B’nai B’rith” open ly took the side of the Confederates. Many spea kers of the order in the North vociferously"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"78 defended slavery and were still working for the goals of the Confede rates after the Civil War. Remarks to Toda y’s Situation: The “ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE” (ADL) which is linked to the “B”NAI B”RITH” recently started a campaign to defame lead ing American b lack politicians as anti-Semites. Thus they aimed at fann ing racial conflict and to n egatively influen ce the positive a ttitude of Jewish Americans who up to then had he lped the blacks. The ADL a lso open ly oppo sed the KKK , yet it clamored in favor of the statue o f Albert Pike (the KKK foun der) which is s till stand ing in Washington D.C., and it is open ly linked to the “Scottish Rite”: “We worship a God, but it is the God one ado res withou t supe rstition. The Masonic religion shou ld be , by all of us initiates of the high degrees, maintained in the purity of the Luciferian doctrine. “If Lucifer were n ot G od, would Adona i (the Christian God) whose deed s prove h is cruelty, perfidy, and hatred of man, barbarism and repu lsion for science, would Adona i and h is priests, calumniate h im? “Yes, Lucifer is God, and u nfortunately Adona i is also God. For the eternal law is that there is no light withou t shade , no bea uty withou t ugliness, no white withou t black, for the ab solute can on ly exist as two Gods. The doctrine of Satanism is a h eresy; and the true and p ure philosoph ic religion is the be lief in Lu cifer, the e qual of Adona i; but Lucifer, God o f Light and God of G od is struggling for humanity against Adona i, the God o f darkness and e vil.” This quote can b e looked u p in the main Pike folder at the library of the “Scottish Rite” in Washington D.C. in French and in English. Pike professed to b e a Satanist and a n a gent of the CR OWN, the “CITY” Pike bestowed in 1867 the 4 th to the 32 nd deg ree of the “Scottish Rite” upon U.S. Presiden t ANDR EW JOHN SON. Thirty-nine da ys after the investiture o f Presiden t Theod ore Roosevelt who was himself an angloph ile racist and Freemason, the statue o f Albert Pike was erected in Washington D.C., where it stands until toda y. [More] remarks on Toda y’s Situation: We see that in a h ierarchic order none b ut the leade r is allowed free will. To attain a h igher deg ree a n aspirant has to fulfill cond itions set by the next higher degree. An e xample: I show the aspirant a “white” book, yet I tell him that it is “black”. Now I ask him of what color the bo ok is. If he a nswers “white”, he ha s failed, though if he says “black”, he is accepted to the ne xt higher degree an d thus to many more ne w tasks he has to fulfill li ke this one. Do you realize that all hierarchies of this world a re set up like this? All schoo l systems, almost all religions including Christianity, Islam, Hindu ism, Buddh ism, Morm ons, Jeho vah’s Witnesses, Scientology – are similarly structured. Persona l opinions, free development and independen t thinking is not allowed, only the following of orders received from those in HIGHER POSITIONS. And it doe s not matter whether it concerns the satanic doctrine – as in the quote b y Pike, mentioned e arlier – or the dogmas of the Catholic or Islamic (etc.) Churches. Those contemporaries who “knowingly” give up their free will and their prope r respon sibility and submit these to an other person, organization o r to a leade r are n ot worthy of better treatment since toda y, especially in the so-called civilized coun tries, nobod y is “forced” to join an organization o r religion. Or, as Anatole France wrote: “And if five million peop le say something stupid, it is nevertheless s tupid!” Abou t President Bill Cli nton, former Governor of Arkansas: In a “Ku Klux Klan Special”, the German magazine Neue Solidaritat informs us that Parson W.O. VA UGHT was a Freemason in the 32 nd deg ree of the Scottish Rite (i.e. Master of the Royal Secret). He was the spiritual teacher and a ctual foster-father of BILL CLINTON and"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"79 collabo rated with h im. When he was governor of Arkansas, a state in which the spiritual tradition of Albert Pike is strongly rooted, Cli nton supp orted capital pun ishment and a llowed several executions to go ahea d. In reality this mean s executing poo r and blacks. Recently Vaught’s son said that Cli nton and his parson a greed that their religious beliefs allowed the killing of prisone rs and of unbo rn bab ies (especially black bab ies). Cli nton is also member of the “Coun cil on Foreign Relations”, of the Trilateral C omm ission, of the “Bilderbergers” (more abou t their importance later), and member for life in the Masonic “Order of DeMolay for Boys”. Jacques de Molay was Grand master of the Knights Templar and was burnt at the stake on March 1 8,1314 in Paris. According to the order’s literature the “Order of DeMolay” is led b y “eminen t Masons” and membership consists of sons of master Masons aged b etween fourteen and twenty-one who a re taug ht the Seven Virtues: Filial Love, Reverence, Courtesy, Comr ade ship, Cleanne ss (of thought, word and deed ), Fidelity and Patriotism. How much this correspond s to reality is a moot point. CH AP TER 16 THE B LACK NOBILITY Before going an y further into the “big picture” we ha ve to take a little de tour again to make things a b it clearer. For the following inform ation I have to thank Ex- MI6 agent Dr. John Coleman for his tremendou s research. He is the on ly one who e ver wrote an ything in English on the “Black Nobility”, and on the American continen t he is a p ione er in this research. I met Dr. Coleman persona lly and tell you that he is sincere in h is intention (I have my own pe rsona l faculty to “read ” or “check” peop le). But he sure is holding ba ck information, as I do, too, because we don ’t want to lose o ur head s. Dr. Coleman tells us abo ut a term you won’t find in an y ordinary boo k or dictiona ry: “The Black Nobility”. These are the oligarchic families of Venice an d Geno a who in the 12 th century held the privileged trading rights (monopo lies). Dr. Coleman: “The first of three crusade s, from 106 3 to 112 3, established the power of the Vene tian Black Nobility and solidified the po wer of the wealthy ruling class. The Black Nobility aristocracy achieved complete control over Venice in 117 1, when the appo intment of the d oge was transferred to what was known a s the Great Coun cil, which consisted of members of the commercial aristocracy, a complete triumph for them. Venice ha s remained in their han ds ever since, but the power and influen ce o f the Vene tian Black Nobility extend s far beyond its borders, and toda y, in 198 6, is felt in e very corner of the globe . In 120 4 the oligarchic family parceled o ut feuda l enclaves to their m embers, and from this epo ch dates the g reat building-up o f power and pressure u ntil the go vernment became a closed corporation of the lead ing Black Nobility families.” The Black Nobility earned its title through d irty tricks , so when the popu lation revolted against the monopo lies in government, as anywhere e lse, the leade rs of the uprising were quickly seized and b rutally hanged . They use secret assassinations, murder, the ban krupting of oppo sing citizens or compan ies, kidnapp ing and rape . So, who a re these families? The most important one s are: House of G uelph (Britain) House of Wettin (Belgium) House of Bernad otte (Sweden ) House of Liechtenstein (Liechtenstein)"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"80 House of O ldenbu rg (Denmark) House of Hohen zollern (Germ any) House of Hano ver (Germany) House of Bourbon (France) House of Orange (Netherlands) House of Grimaldi (Mona co) House of Wittelsbach (Germany) House of Braganza (Portugal) House of Nassau (Luxembou rg) House of Habsburg (Austria) House of Savoy (Italy) House of Karadjordjevic (Yugoslavia) House of Wurttemberg (Germany) House of Zogu (Alban ia) As well as the one s y ou will find o n the Family Tree o f the Windsors . (Black Nobility Unmasked Worldwide, Dr. John Coleman, 1985 ). All the families listed are conne cted with the House o f G uelph, one o f the original Black Nobility families of Venice from which the House of Windsor and thus the present Q ueen of England , Elisabe th II, descend s. The Guelphs are so intertwined with the Germ an aristocracy through the House o f Hano ver that it would take several pages to mention a ll their conn ections. As you can see in this family tree, almost all Europea n royal hou ses originate from the House of Hano ver and thus from the House of G uelph – the Black Nobility. The Hano verian English King George I came from the Duchy of Lunenb erg, a part of Northern Germany, which had been governed by the Guelph family since the 12 th century. Toda y the Guelphs rule by dominating the raw materials market, and for years they have fixed the price o f gold, a commodity they do ne ither produ ce nor own. The House of Windsor also controls the price of copp er, zinc, lead an d tin. And a s y ou will see, it is no acciden t that the principle comm odity exchan ges are located in London . Compan ies run b y Black Nobility families are British Petroleum, O ppenhe imer, Lon rho, Philbro and others. Another Black Nobility family are the Grosveno rs in England . For centuries this family lived – a s most of the European royal families – o n ground rent. Toda y the family owns at least 300 a cres of land in the center of Londo n. The land is never sold, but leased on a 39 year leaseho ld ag reement – the groun d rent of the middle ages. Grosveno r Square, in which the American Embassy is located, belong s to the Grosveno r family, as doe s Eaton Square. In Eaton Square apa rtments are rented o ut at 25,000 pound s a month, and that doe s not include maintenan ce costs. This will give you some idea of the immense wealth the Black Nobility families garner from groun d rents, and why families like the Windsors are n ot at all interested in indu strial progress along with the e xcess popu lation it suppo rts. This is the only reason why these “nob le” families are beh ind most, if not all, of the wrong-heade d Pro- environmental movements of the world that ultimately and covertly aim to curb popu lation growth. Prince Philip and Prince Charles are the most visible symbols of these movements and bo th have often spoken with the utmost callousness abou t the need to rid the world of unwanted peop le. (Black Nobility Unmasked Worldwide, Dr. John Coleman). So why do l mention the Black Nobility? Because they are the founde rs of THE secret society of our day from which a ll the others are conne cted to the Illuminati originated from – the “Committee o f 300”. As I will show you, the Club of Rome, the CFR, the RIIA, the Bilderbergers, the UN , the Round Table...all originate from the “Comm ittee o f 300” and therefore from the European Black Nobility families. Well, here comes the most important point. Dr. Coleman has bee n perfectly right up to here. He thinks that the European Black Nobility is the cause o f all that is wrong."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"81 But, since at least the 17 th century absolutely every European royal hou se h as bee n infiltrated by JEWS. The House of Hano ver seems to be Germ an, but it is J ewish. So is the House of Habsburg. So it wasn’t really the Germans who took over the British throne . Brilliant, isn’t it? (Sources: “Semi Goter” by Phillip Stauff and “Judenb lut im deutshen Adel” [Jewish Blood in German Nobility] by Otto Furst von Batailler). Co-ope rating with the European Black Nobility are American families like the Harrimans and the McGeorge Bund ys. CH AP TER 17 THE E NGLISH ROYA L FAMILY A ND THE OPIUM TRADE IN THE 18 TH CENTUR Y Before dea ling with England a t all, we ha ve to clarify a few terms. The QUEE N i s the head of the Royal family, with the British colonial empire – with London as its capital – governed b y the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. But just like the Vatican being within Rome, there is a separate, independe nt state within London , the CITY. The CITY, which is c alled the richest square mile in the world, occupies just abou t that area in the hea rt of London (2.7 sqaure Km.). It is s aid to ha ve abo ut 4,600 inhab itants and abou t a million jobs. The government of the CITY is THE CR OWN, comprised o f thirteen members and led b y the King of the CITY, the LORD MAY OR. Here one finds the richest and mightiest econo mic institutions of England , like the “Bank of England ” controlled b y the Rothschilds, Lloyd’s of London , the Londo n Stock Exchan ge, the offices of many internationa l merchant compan ies and Fleet Street, the center of newspape rs and pub lishing. The CITY doe s not belong to England . It is s ubject of neither the mona rch nor the government of British Parliament. The CITY is the true government of England , as both the Quee n and the Prime Minister are subordinate to the Lord Mayor and listen to him. By the façade of a Prime Minister and a cabinet the impression is given that these de cide what happen s, yet that are just puppe ts of the CITY. If the Quee n visits the CITY, she is met by the Lord Mayor at “Temple Bar” the symbolic gate to the CITY. She bo ws and asks permission to enter his private an d sovereign state. He shows his app roval by hand ing her the state sword. At state visits like this the Lord Mayor in h is robe an d chain eclipses the Queen, and h er entourage are restricted to ordinary street clothes. Then h e proceed s to lead the Quee n who goes two steps beh ind him into the CITY. As I mentioned e arlier, the found ing of the “Bank of England” was instigated b y William Paterson who was a CITY agent. According to Des Griffin, the CITY is c ontrolled b y the Rothschild e mpire. Thus, in order to void misinterpretations, we ha ve to realize that in Great Britain there are two sepa rately acting empires – the colonial empire und er the royal family and the empire o f the Crown. All colonies with a white popu lation (Australia, New Zealand , Canad a, and South Africa) were unde r the authority of the English government. All other colonies (India, Egypt, Bermuda , Malta, Singapore, HongKong , Gibraltar and the Central African colonies) were the p rivate prope rty of the CR OWN, so-called CR OWN C OLONIES . Of course there was c o-ope ration, because the Windsor family is part of and the City belongs to the Black Nobility. During the building of the Empire the BRITISH EA ST IND IA COMPA NY (BE IC) made an imm ense fortune with the opium trade . The BE IC established the “China Inland Mission” whose main task was to get Chinese chea p labo rers depende nt on op ium to create a market for their wares. Members of the British royal family were so impressed by the imm ense profits that they collabo rated with the BE IC. They began by taxing the op ium produ cers in India. Huge amoun ts of opium were shipped from India o n the “China Tea Cli ppe rs”, and aroun d 13% of"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"82 India’s income unde r the CROWN came from selling pure Bengal opium in China, supe rvised b y them. Surely the court did no t want this shad y episode e xposed. Therefore they involved the British Secret Services, the BRITISH MILITARY INTELLIGENC E DEPA RTMENT (MI6) AND THE SE CR ET INTELLIGENC E SE RVICE (SIS). The MI6 goes back to Queen Elisabe th I unde r whom Sir Francis Walsingham became treasurer for the “Dirty Tricks” depa rtment of the MI6. Due to its several centuries of experience the MI6 is c ounted among the best secret services of the world. The BE IC was market leade r in the opium trade u ntil C hinese government prohibited the smoking of opium in 172 9. From 1791 to 189 4 the number of licensed op ium plantations grew unde r the Crown from 87 to 66 3. This finally led to the Opium War in China. In 172 9 the BE IC, as an arm of the Black Nobility, founde d the “COMM ITTEE OF 300” to simplify the hand ling of banking and comm ercial transactions. Toda y the “Committee o f 300 ” is one o f the most important secret organizations and is also working towards a “One World Government”. It is the so-called e lite from the CITY. Later this “Comm ittee of 300” developed tactics to o vercome the Chinese anti-drug laws. LORD INCHC APE established the “P& O Shipping Compan y” and was the actual founde r of the “Hong Kong & Shanghai Bank” that helped in covering u p the opium trade. Other British ban ks involved in the d rug trade are the British Bank of the Middle East, The Midland Bank, The Nationa l Westminster Bank, Barclays Bank, The Royal Bank of Canad a and Baring Brothers Bank. All these ba nks are linked to the Rothschild ba nks by the “Committee o f 300 ”. When the Harriman railroad was being constructed to link California with the East of the U.S. thou sand s of Chinese cheap laborers were transshipped to work on the tracks. Many were alread y dependen t on opium, and thus the market was extended to the U.S. HARR IMAN founded h is railroad empire with finan cing from the “N.M. Rothschild & S ons Bank” in London . There are good reasons to dedu ce that the Chinese op ium-dependen t labo rers were intentiona lly used to e xtend the opium m arket to the U.S. Remarks on Toda y’s Situation: The Neue Solidaritat wrote in a n article titled “The Queen an d Narcotics” in its edition of September 8, 199 3: “It is rare, indee d, a pleasant surprise, to read in the British p ress news abou t the court that comes close to the truth. Last week such an item vied with the head lines on the front page of the Londo n Times of August 27, 199 3. The head line: “The Royal Family was ‘Hi gh’ in the Highland s”. The article, based o n a carefully researched repo rt in the Scottish magazine Leopa rd, discloses that drugs and narcotics were u sed as a matter of course. From original documents the Leop ard proved the Quee n Victoria and h er entourage, often the Churchill and Rothschild families, had stand ing o rders fro sizeab le quantities of cocaine, heroin an d other narcotics with a h ighland ph arm acy. The Times averred the same. It said: “Queen Victoria, the monarch with the severe mien, well-known for her “We are not amused” seems to ha ve o rdered eno ugh cocaine and h eroin for her Balmoral estate in Scotland to keep a whole Highland valley ‘high’.” The pap ers of the pha rmacy “show that the Royals and their guests were regularly supp lied with considerable a mounts of cocaine an d heroin solutions.” CH AP TER 18 BA CKGROUND OF THE B OLSHEV IST REV OLUTION Because of the many anti-Jewish laws in Europe , many Jews had no prope rty and thus were forced to travel around . Whatever coun try they elected to be in, they encountered a"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"83 closed front against them. At the en d o f the 19 th century Czarist Russia was the on ly real obstacle left against the Illuminati ruling the world. In 188 1 Theodo r Herzl, a Khazar Jew, again, founded the ZIONIST MOVE MENT in Odessa, Russia, in order to create a Jewish ho meland in Palestine. At a B’NAI B’RITH meeting in New York in 1916 , Jacob Schiff, presiden t of the Kuhn Loeb & Co. Bank, was elected presiden t of the revolutiona ry “Zionist Movement in Russia”. On Janu ary 13, 1917 , the Jew LEON TROTSKY (formerly Bronstein) arrived in the U.S. and received an American pa ssport. He was s een on o ccasion to enter the palatial residen ce o f JACOB S CH IFF . In their m eetings they talked abo ut the Zionist unrest in Russia, also abou t what was learned from the un successful attempt to overthrow the Czar. Jacob Schiff finan ced the training of Trotsky’s rebe ls who were mainly Jews from New York’s East End and who were trained on a p lot in New Jersey belonging to Rockefeller’s STAND ARD OIL COMPA NY. When they had be come proficient in guerrilla warfare, Trotsky’s rebe ls left t he U.S., with 20 million U.S.$ from Jacob Schiff, on the SS K ristianisfjord for Russia, there to start the Bolshevik Revolution, so the Khazars c ould get Russia ba ck. Trotsky and Len in were bo th linked to the Committee of 300 by Bruce Lockhart. CH AP TER 19 SK ULL AND BONES Let us now examine a most powerful organization of the Illuminati in the U.S., the SK ULL & BONES order. Its own members call it simply “The Order”, it has been known for m ore than 15 0 years as “Local 322 ” of a Germ an secret society. Others c all it the “Brotherhoo d o f Death”. The secret order of SK ULL & B ONES was established a t YA LE UN IVE RSITY in 1833 by WILLIAM HUN TINGTON RU SSE L and ALPHONSO TAFT. Russel brought it in 1832 from his s tude nt days in Germany. In 1856 the order was incorporated into the Russel Trust. In 186 4 WILLIAM RU SSE L be came a member of the assembly of Conne cticut and in 186 2 he be came Gene ral of the Nationa l Guard. ALPHONSO TAFT became Secretary of War in 1870 (?), then U.S. Attorney Gene ral in 1876 and in 188 4 U.S. Ambassador to Russia. Alphon so’s s on William was appo inted Chief Justice an d later elected PRES IDENT of the U.S. It is an o ld tradition to mark the tombstone s of Freemasons with the Master degree with a skull and crossbone s, a tradition a lso h arking back to the time o f the Knights Templar after 1127 A.D. Perhap s the order’s name comes from one of these traditions. Yale is the on ly university with societies that are on ly open to seniors. The other two societies at Yale a re the SCR OLL & KEY and the WOLF”S HEA D. The cand idates are exclusively white, male, Protestant and usually from very rich families. Often the fathers were a lread y members in the same order. During the last year of study they are called KNIGHT and later – for life – PATRIARCH . The reun ions of Patriarchs take place at the DEE R ISLAND C LUB in New York. This c lub was founde d in 1907 b y the Patriarch George Douglas. The Deer Island Club is esclusively run b y Patriarchs, as is the Russel Trust. The most important members of the Eastern L iberal Establishment surprisingly have a lways been members of one o f these societies. THE EA STERN LIBE RAL ESTAB LISHMENT is – according to Gary Allen – a circumlocution for the finan cial, political, acade mic and media- political Mafia bo ssed b y the ROCKE FELLERS. Here one shou ld mention the W.A. Harriman Compan y. The found er of this bank, William Averell H arriman was initiated into the Skull & B one s order in 191 3. In the Twenties Harriman was the main supp orter of the Russians with fund s and d iplomatic aid. Harriman"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"84 had further supp ort by the first Soviet commercial bank, the RU SK OMBA NK. MAX MAY, vice-presiden t of the Guaranty Trust and a member of the Skull & B one s, was the first vice- presiden t of the Ruskombank. The Guaranty Trust was c ontrolled b y J.P. Morgan & Co. the partner bank of the N.M. Rothschild Bank. Some p artners of J.P. Morgan were Skull & Bone s members: Harold Stanley, initiated in 1908 , Thomas Cochran, initiated in 190 4. The original capital for the Guaranty Trust came from the Whitneys, Rockefellers, Vande rbilts and Harrimans, all families with members in the Skull & B one s order. PE RC Y ROCKE FELLER was the on ly Rockefeller accepted. He represented the Rockefeller investment in the Guaranty Trust and was its director from 1915 to 193 0. A short summary of the banks just mentioned : The N.M. Rothschild & S ons had its main branches in Londo n, Paris, Vienna an d Berlin. Alread y then the Rothschilds not only controlled the CITY of Londo n, thus the Crown colonies and the British Government, but also French government, the Committee of 300, the Bavarian Illuminati and so all the secret lodges in Europe an d the U.S. infiltrated by the Bavarian Illuminati. Together with their representatives in the U.S. – the Kuhn Loe b & Co. (director: Jacob Schiff), the August Belmont & Co. and the J.P. Morgan & Co. – a nd the M.M. Warburg Gesellschaft in Hamburg and Amsterdam they built up – among others – Rockefellers Standa rd Oil empire, Harriman’s railroad an d Carnegie’s steelworks and thereby controlled the greatest part of the American e conomy. The banks just mentioned a re among the most powerful in the world and are a ll controlled by Rothschild. And these were just the “mode st” beginnings of the Rothschild e mpire, as we are abo ut to see. CH AP TER 20 ...AND THU S E ND ETH FREE DOM IN AMERICA Towards the en d o f the 19 th century the banks controlled b y the Rothschilds started a big campaign to get the rich American econo my unde r their control. Aroun d 1900 the Rothschilds s ent a further agent to the U.S., PA UL WARBUR G, to collabo rate with the ban king firm of Kuhn Loeb & Co. Take note o f this name: he was yet to interlink many more organizations! JACOB S CH IFF and PA UL WARBURG started a campaign for the creation of the FEDERAL RESE RVE BA NK as an established PRIVATE central ban k in America. In 190 7 Jacob Schiff said b efore the New York Chamber of Commerce: “If we don ’t get a central bank with sufficient credit control this coun try will experience the most severe an d far-reaching financial pan ic in its history.” (Des Griffin: Descent Into Slavery). No soone r said than don e. They went on to hurl the U.S. into a mone tary crisis the resulting pan ic at the finan cial market of which ruined the lives of tens of thou sands of peop le a ll over the country. The pan ic at the New York stock exchan ge brought the Rothschilds – quite apa rt from a profit of several billion U.S.$ - the success they hoped for. Cunn ingly planned , the pan ic was used as an argument for the establishment of a central bank to stave off similar occurrences. Paul Warburg then told the bank and currency committee: “In the Panic of 190 7, the first suggestion was ‘let us have a n ationa l clearing hou se’ (Central Bank).” (Gary Allen: None Dare Call It Conspiracy). The final version of the de cision to introdu ce the FEDERAL RESE RVE SYS TEM (the private central bank of the U.S.) was c onceived on J.P. Morgan’s estate on Jekyll Island , Georgia. According to H.G. Dorsey the meeting was attende d by A. Piatt Andrew, Sena tor Nelson"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"85 Aldrich, Frank Vande rlip (president of Kuhn Loeb & Co.), Henry Davidson (senior partner in the J.P. Morgan Bank), Charles Norton (presiden t of Morgan’s First Nationa l Bank), Paul Warburg an d Benjamin Strong (presiden t of Morgan’s Bankers Trust Co.). The introdu ction in 191 3 o f the Federal R eserve System enab led the internationa l bankers to consolidate their finan cial powers in the U.S. Paul Warburg was the firs c hairm an o f the Fede ral R eserve Bank of New York. The Fede ral R eserve Act was s oon followed b y the 16 th Amendment to the Constitution which enab led Cong ress to levy taxes on the p ersona l income of U.S. citizens. This was the consequence of the fact that the U.S. government could no longer print its own mone y to finan ce its ope rations. For the first time since the founding of the U.S., income tax was levied. The foremost shareho lders of the FEDERAL RESE RVE (The FED) were: Rothschild ba nks in London an d Paris Lazard Brothers Bank in Paris Israel Moses Seif Bank in Italy Warburg Bank in Hamburg an d Amsterdam Leh man Bank in New York Kuhn Loeb Bank in New York Rockefeller’s Chase Manha ttan Bank in New York Goldman Sachs Bank in New York. Congressman CH ARLES LIND BE RGH alread y then described the ne w Fede ral R eserve System as the “Invisible Government” by it finan cial power. How doe s “The FED” function? The FED’S “Open Market Comm ittee” produ ces Fede ral R eserve Notes (dollar notes). THESE NOTES ARE THEN LOANED TO THE U.S. GO VE RN MENT AGAINST OBLIGATIONS THAT SE RVE THE FED AS SE CUR ITY. THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE HELD BY THE TWELVE FED BA NKS WHICH R ECEIVE THE YEA RLY INTEREST PA YMENTS THEREON. Remarks to Toda y’s Situation: In 198 2 the U.S. tax office put the nationa l debt at US$ 115 ,800,000 ,000 in interest payments from the American tax payers. This interest capital goes into the coffers of the Fed, and so to the internationa l PRIVATE bankers. In 199 2 the obligations held b y the Fed reached US$ 5,000 ,000,000 ,000an d the interest payments by the tax payers rise continua lly. And this fortune was c reated b y the FED lend ing mone y to the U.S. government and charging h igh interest rates for something that cost the FED only pape r, ink and printing costs. This is one of the b iggest swindles in the history of the U.S. and almost nobod y notices. And so the FED holds – via the obligations of the U.S. government – the lien o n the state and private p roperty of the WHOLE OF THE UN ITED STATES OF AMERICA. Innumerable lawsuits have no t been successful in reversing the Fede ral R eserve Act. There is no legal way for the citizens to reclaim the mone y because the FED i s not a part of the government but a private intitution. Appa rently the FED i s not constitutiona l and shou ld therefore not exist. Nine U.S. states have cases pend ing to abo lish the FED. CH AP TER 21 THE ROTHSCH ILD TOWING SE RVICE Kings and dictators were a lways infamous for spend ing more than they could squee ze ou t of their subjects in taxes. The nations and government then had to b orrow the ne cessary sums from the banks. But how could the ba nks retrieve their m one y if a government could not or would no t pay up? The solution is war!"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"86 The business of finan cing governments functions on similar lines as the credit institute that lend s a client mone y to buy a car. If the client canno t pay the monthly installments the car is recovered. And ho w doe s one recover a vehicle? With an other car! The same with finan cing governments. You don ’t just lend mone y to one coun try only, you a lso lend to that coun try’s ene mies. The lend er has to ensure that both countries are of about the same strength so that in the case o f conflict finan cing will be the de ciding factor. If a country doe s not pay up, the lende r will threaten it with war by ano ther coun try of, if it still refuses payment, have it “recovered” by that other coun try as booty. (see Machiavelli). The House of Rothschild ha s followed these guidelines for abo ut 160 years now (No. 9 of the Protocols). Nathan and his brothers started this “game” at the b eginning of last century in Europe , after they reaped so much profit from the Napo leon ic wars. At that time something de veloped in Europe that came to be known a s the “Balance o f Powers”. In order to strengthen its position a s “invisible ruler” of Europe the House of ROTHSCH ILD had to build up two po wer group s of similar strength to guarantee that “Balance of Powers”. They had to ascertain that all the A kings c ould be threatene d with a ll the B kings. Naturally they finan ced both sides. Then they required a third po wer as a kind o f insurance shou ld on e o f the countries sep ou t of line. This c ountry is Nathan ’s England which thus was s upreme power in Europe. The outcome of a war could a lways be de termined b y checking which side was favored b y England . At the en d England was always on the side o f the winne r. England , or the Crown, more app ropriately, had such a n e fficient kingdom r ecovery service a t their hand s that the power of the hou se o f ROTHSCH ILD reached tremendo us heights.

England ruled supreme over the continen t until 1871 . This supremacy had been repea tedly challenged by Spain and b y France b ut England a lways remained victorious. The fact that G erm any now grew stronger, by acquiring colonies and by building up its military force, was a severe threat to the Illuminati, but also to England and its s upremacy over Europe both economically and militarily. To coun teract this, the internationa l bankers who a t that time were to a large e xtent excluded from the econo mic development in Germany, sought for ways to limit and control Germany. Between 1894 an d 1907 a number of internationa l treaties were signed to have Russia, France, England and further nations unit aga inst G erm any in the case of war. It was the task of the COMM ITT EE OF 300 to set the stage for the First World War. From the ROUND TAB LE group emerged as a front the “Royal institute for Internationa l Affaris” (RIIA). It is also known a s “Chatham House” and ha d a mong its found ing members Lord Albert G rey, Lord Arnold Toynbee – eminen ce g rise of the MI6, H.G. Wells, Lord Alfred Milner – head of the Roun d Table, and H.J. Mackinder – inventor of the so-called geopo litics. From the Committee of 300 the RIIA got the order to study possible ways to stage this war. The order was handed to L ord Northcliff, Lord Rothmere – b oth members of the Comm ittee of 300 and L ord Toynbee of the MI6.

Thereupon the English working class was s ubjected to soph isticated propagand a method s to convince them that they had to send their sons by the thou sands to their deaths. In America, President Theod ore Roosevelt, the 26 th Presiden t, said du ring his election campaign in 191 2: “Behind the visible government there is an invisible government upo n the throne that owes the peop le n o loyalty and recognizes no respon sibility. To de stroy this invisible government, to und o the ungodly union be tween corrupt business and corrupt politics is the task of a statesman.” (Dieter Ruggebe rg: “Gehe impolitik”, p. 75) CH AP TER 24 THE FIRST WORLD WAR AS SEE N BY THE ILLUMINATI At the beginning of the 20 th century the world appea red to be at pea ce. But beh ind the scene s prepa rations were well unde r way for a b lood b ath the world would no t forget for a long time. The Illuminati had recognized that in o rder to fulfill their plan for a “New World Order” successfully, they had to create such a state o f devastation that no nation would remain untouched . Most historians agree that the cause o f war was actually a rather trivial dispute b etween Austria an d Serbia. The assassination of the Austrian he ir to the throne Archduke Franz Ferdinand and h is wife Soph ie b y the Serbian nationa list G avrilo Princip of the occult secret society “Black Hand ” is Sarajevo sparked the First World War. This was used by the h idde n powers to realize the World War that Albert Pike had predicted more than forty y ears before. Since the e vents of that war are generally known, I would like to concentrate h ere on the Russian side. Despite ha ving the largest arm y in the world Russia was desperately unde requipped for any sizeab le a ction. Before fighting started in 191 4 the CR OWN had promised Russian its full supp ort and military help in the case o f war. After the war had begun, that help was redu ced to 10% of its pre-war level. Appa rently the finan cial monopo lists wanted to force Russia into a s dangerous a situation a s possible, in p erfect agreement with Pike’s plan. At a time when millions of Russians had a lread y died o n the battlefields, the ROTHSCH ILD agents c ompounde d the problems by their activities. Their endea vors – following the Illuminati’s philosoph y founde d upo n misery and insecurity – to set the stage for a revolution following the German d efeat, was s uccessful. The revolution started in February 1917 when the Czar was depo sed an d a provisiona l government und er Prince Georgy Luvov took over. This government however did no t succeed in staving off t he nationa l decline. Here I would like to continue the chapter “Background of the Bolshevik Revolution”, after TROTSK Y and h is rebe ls had left New York on the SS -Kristianiafjord with 20 million US$ in gold. The boa t – chartered b y JACOB S CH IFF – was held up o n April 3, 191 7 by the Canad ian authorities at Halifax, Nova Scotia. The Illuminati plan seemed doo med. But Jacob Schiff and h is Illuminati friend s in the U.S. government and in England e xerted their influen ce an d soon the voyage could continue . After arrival in Europe Trotsky went to Switzerland to meet with Len in, Stalin, Kagano vich and L itvinov and to co-ordinate their strategy."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"89 Perhap s it is interesting to note here that the head s and a gents of all the na tions involved in the war could meet in ne utral Switzerland . At the Congress of Vienna in 1815 – a fter Napo leon ’s defeat – Switzerland was restored. The confede ration was guaranteed neu trality forever by the powers of Europe. An a cciden t? Or, doe s not such a safe p lace in the center of Europe fit the p lans of the parties living off the war perfectly? As Dr. Coleman proves in h is books, the Black Nobility plays the main role beh ind the “Swiss Thea ter”. Now the conspirators faced the question of how to get the rebe ls and e quipment from Switzerland to Russia. The answer was furnished b y the ROTHSCH ILD agent and chief of the German secret police MAX WARBUR G. He ha d them all packed in a sealed railway carriage an d made sure this passed safely through Germany to the Russian bo rder. When the train stoppe d in Germany for the first time, two Germ an o fficers got on to escort it. They had been commandee red by General ERICH LUD END ORFF . Max Warburg was the brother of Paul Warburg, the first chairman of the “Fede ral R eserve Bank”. In July 1917 the conspiracy suppo rted b y the internationa l bankers suffered a first setback and L ENIN, ano ther famous Khazar, had to flee with a few others to Finland . But in November 1917 they were finally successful. And no wonde r, if we look at the finan cial supp ort they had following their training in New York. During the blood y civil war that ensued a fter the Bolshevik Revolution, Len in was the und isputed leade r of political activities while Trotsky organized the military arm, the “Red Arm y”. That name was not an acciden tal choice. The Bolshevik army unde r Trotsky was the dead ly instrument of the Khazar internationa l bankers controlled b y the Rothschilds (= red shield). So it was very befitting to ha ve the arm y carry a red emblem. It is now an e stablished h istorical fact that most of the rebe ls led b y Len in were Jews. The Times of March 29 , 1919 , wrote that “ one o f the most interesting features of the Bolshevik movement is the high pe rcentage o f non-Russians in the lead ership. O F THE 30 OR SO COMMISS IONERS OF LEA DERS THAT FORM THE CENTRAL APPA RATUS OF THE BOLSHEV IK MOVE MENT, NO LESS THAN 75% ARE JEWS.” Why did the Jews in pa rticular have an interest in Russian or the Russian mona rchy? Well, if you don ’t know abou t the Khazars, it won’t make an y sense. Remember that the Khazar empire ha d been conquered by the Varangians, later the founde rs of the Russian monarchy. As you know, the Jews believe in revenge and ne ver forget their defeats. So, they prepared a very careful plan, an invisible p lan, to win ba ck “their” country and ha ve somebod y else pun ished for getting it back for them, i.e. the Bolsheviks. According to writings of Gene ral A. Nechvolodo v the French secret service had found o ut that Jacob Schiff had d irectly supp lied the Russian revolutiona ries with a further 12 million US$. Nechvolodo v also na me Felix Warburg, Otto Kahn, Mortimer Schiff, Jerome H. Hanaue r and Max Breitung in the U.S. and Max Warburg, Olaf Aschburg and Jivtovshy in Europe a s further financiers of the Bolshevik Revolution. The ambassado r of the Russian Empire to the U.S., Bakhmetiev, declared that after the Bolshevik victory 600 million Roub led in gold were transferred from Russian to the Kuhn Loeb Bank in New York between 1918 an d 1922 . The book “The Sealed Train” by Michael Pearson shows that – according to do cuments of the German Foreign Office – up to February 5, 191 8 Germany had supp lied 4 0,580 ,997 Marks for propagand a and “special requirements”. In the same d ocument it is s tated that the German treasury released 15 million Marks to Russia on e day after Len in seized po wer. The blood y massacre of millions of Russians and the e nslavement of further millions was however of scant interest to the internationa l bankers on their way to world do minan ce."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"90 CH AP TER 25 THE OCHR ANA (FORMER RU SS IAN SE CR ET SE RVICE) The Bolshevik Revolution was, however, not only suppo rted by the U.S. and Germ any. The OCHR ANA, the secret service foun d by the last Czar, consisted of several organizations that carried ou t all the usual functions of a secret service with secret agents, doub le agents, secret police and agen ts provocateurs. The Ochrana though was a very subversive and criminal group which greatly simplified the work of the Illuminati. Huge sums of mone y from the internationa l bankers, among o thers from ALFRED MILNER who later took over the secret “Roun d Table”, were pou red into the Ochrana that alread y had infiltrated the Bolshevik movement. Agents steered many of its activities. The infiltration was s o strong that in 190 8 four of the five members of the Petersburg comm ittee of the Bolshevik party were Ochrana a gents. They channe led the fund s that came from the internationa l bankers to the Bolsheviks who could therefore suppress their strongest opponen ts, the Mensheviks and the Socialist Party. Two a gents of the Ochrana were the editor and the finan cial controller of the “Pravda” and suppo rted its beginning. It is s aid that the hidden Jew JOSEP H STALIN (his real name was J ossip Vissariono vich Djugashvili) was also a member of the Ochrana since h e was an important contact between the Czarist police an d the Bolsheviks. After he depo sition of the Czar in 191 7 the Ochrana was officially disbanded , but it was rebu ilt unde r the name CH EKA until in 192 0 its membership was increased tenfold. In 192 1 the n ame was c hanged to GPU, then to OGPU, then in 1934 to NKV D. The Russian system of concentration camps that was built und er Len in and reached its peak unde r Stalin was governed b y the NKV D. The camps formed p art of the Soviet economy and a lmost half the gold an d chromium production was mined with forced labo r by camp inmates. Until 1950 the camps c laimed the lives of abo ut 4 million peop le. In the First World War around 1 0 million Russian soldiers were killed, not to mention the millions of civilians. Until 1950 the communist system had left abou t a further 40 million dead . Adding these up you ha ve abou t as many dead a s the old West Germ any had living, and those ore only the figures officially accessible. Finally the NKV D became the MGB, then the KGB which in 1982 was the bigge st secret service in the world – with 90 ,000 staff officers and 175,000 b order guards – a nd remained if for a further ten years. The GOSBA NK, the Russian central bank, functioned after the same principles as the Fede ral R eserve. It created mone y from zero and was the dream of every finan cial capitalist. The Gosbank c ontrolled the Soviet finan cial transactions even more than the central banks of the West, for all transactions between Soviet compan ies are carried out by the Gosbank. Thus Gosbank c ould control all the transactions that involve Soviet compan ies.

Shortly afterwards the Americans went to war. The Illuminati sold Woodrow Wilson to the American peop le b y saying that he represented the “New Freedo m”. The First World War was very good bu siness for the illumined ba nkers. Bernard Baruch, who be came chairman o f the War Industries Board, raised h is fortune from 1 million US$ to 200 million. The next action b y Woodrow Wilson at the beh est of Colone l H ouse was to convince Congress of the n ecessity of form ing the “LEAGUE OF NATIONS” which later became the UN . A further decisive step by the Illuminati towards world po wer had been taken. Des Griffin describes the First World War from the viewpoint of the Illuminati as follows: “1. America’s policy of isolationism and ne utrality, expounded so eloquently by George Washington in his farewell message an d given official expression in the Monroe Doctrine, died. A precede nt was established – a lbeit through monumental deceit – for America’s use as a military tool in the hand s of the Internationa l Bankers. “2. Czarist Russia, a thorn in the side of the mone y monopo lists for many y ears, had been successfully removed from the world scene. This had been forecast forty-seven years earlier by top Illuminist Albert Pike, in h is famous letter to Mazzini. “3. World War I created astronomical nationa l debts in the nations which pa rticipated. These deb ts were he ld b y the Internationa l Bankers who, as we ha ve seen , organ ized and stage-managed the show from start to finish. “Thea ters of war” have a lways proved extremely lucrative to their managers and those who finan ce them!” The Treaty of Versailles of course was also ba sed on Rothschild p lans. On the American side stood the Rothschild pupp et Woodrow Wilson with h is advisors and Rothschild agents Colone l H ouse and Bernard Baruch, on the English side, more exactly the side of the CR OWN, was Lloyd George, member of the Comm ittee o f 300 , with h is advisor SIR PHILIP SASS OO N, a d irect descenda nt of Amschel R othschild and member of the English Privy Coun cil. France ha d Prime Minister Clemenceau an d GEORGE MAND EL a s a de legation. Mand el, born JEROBEA M ROTHSCH ILD, was often called the Disraeli of France, made this round p erfect. Colone l H ouse, at the pe ak of his powers, was the central figure a t the Peace Conference. It happened once that Clemenceau arrived when Presiden t Wilson was with House. Wilson was required to leave the room while House and Clemenceau conferred in p rivate. Philip Snowden de scribes the treaty as follows: “The treaty shou ld satisfy brigand s, imperialists and militarists. It is the dea thblow to those who e xpected the end of the war to bring pea ce. It is not a pea ce treaty, but a declaration of ano ther war. It is the be trayal of democracy and of the fallen in the war. The treaty exposes the true aims of the Allies.” Lloyd George said: “We have written a do cument that guarantees war in twenty y ears. When you p lace cond itions on a peop le (Germ any) that it cann ot possibly keep , you force it either to break the agreement or to war.” And we know now w ho the g roup of persons beh ind the treaty of Versailles was and what their aims were.

Had they succeeded a lread y after then , the following wars would no longer have been ne cessary. After the arm istice on November 11, 191 8 WOODR OW WILSON and h is advisor Colone l H OUSE came to Europe in the hope to foun d there a World Government in the shape of the Le ague o f Nations. Wilson’s “fourteen points” lost their impact and so their plan failed. That is why in 1919 , HOUSE met with members of the British secret organization “The Round Table”. It had be come obvious that in o rder to reach that aim, they had to expand their system substantially. After the RIIA had bee n established in England , it was decided that a fronting organization was also needed in the U.S. So, Colone l H ouse, serving a s host for the Roun d Table group, called – d uring the pea ce conference in Paris in 191 9 – the be st heads of Wilson’s “Brain Trust” together to form a group dea ling with internationa l concerns. This group then returned from Paris to New York and in 19 21 was named the “Coun cil on Foreign Relations” (CFR). The CFR has Americans as its members and the Roun d Table group a s its core organization. Toda y the CFR – together with the TRILATERAL COMMISS ION – is the most influential backgroun d o rganization in the U.S. Both the CFR and the Round Table are beh ind the J.P. Morgan & Co.

CH AP TER 30 PREPA RING THE SE COND WORLD WAR On February 6, 192 9, MONTAGU NORMAN, chairm an of the BA NK OF ENGLAND , came to Washington to consult with the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury ANDR EW MELLON. Afterwards the “Fede ral Reserve” raised the lead ing interest rate. On March 9, 192 9, Paul Warburg wrote in the Finan cial C hronicles: “If we a llow orgies of unlimited speculation to go too far,...then a total collapse is assured.” Those who unde rstood quietly withdrew from the stock exchan ge and invested in GO LD AND SILVE R. Des Griffin add s: “In the fall of 192 9 it was time for the Internationa l Bankers to pu sh the button that set in motion the machinery that resulted in World War II. After they, their agents and friend s had sold ou t of the crest of an artificially inflated stock market boo m, the Internationa l Bankers pulled the rug o ut from und er the whole system and sent the United States into what became known a s the Great Depression.

The collapse of the German currency because of these pa yments was foreseeab le – chronic inflation! In the midst of this chao s Germ any issued a moratorium on all payments of reparation for two years. The victorious powers refused and on Janu ary 9, 1923 voted three to on e – England voted against at the be hest of the CITY – that the German Reich b e deemed in arrears in its payments in kind. Upon the French and Belgian troop s occupied the Ruhr area. But when the Germ an workers in the Ruhr called a general strike, the o ccupation proved a flop. The troop s left t his dea d-end when Germ any agreed to a compromise known as the DAWES P lan. The “Dawes Plan” was c onceived b y J.P. Morgan, the ROTHSCH ILD henchman, and shou ld g rand Germ any credits of 800 million US$ in the first four years. The Dawes Plan however failed when Germany’s repa ration pa yments grew. It was replaced by the “Young Plan” (named after the Morgan agent O wen Young ): In order to p lund er m ore easily, the internationa l bankers established the “Bank for Internationa l Settlement (BIS). Thus the repa ration pa yments for the First World War were ea sily executed b y transferring fund s from the loan a ccoun ts of one coun try to the accounts of another also with this same bank. Here again the ba nkers profited, with charges and commissions. Professor Quigley states: “It is noteworthy that this s ystem ( Dawes and Young Plans) was established b y the internationa l bankers and that lend ing mone y to Germany was very profitable for those ban kers.” This is a prime example of the Machiavellian system. On the on e han d the bankers suppo rted all the warring parties and now they even loaned the mone y for the repa ration payments by the Germans. Whatever Germany did, it was c lear for the outset from whom they would – o r rather had – to lend [borrow] mone y.

There were o ther plans and goals to realize – it was the turn o f war number two! The immense sums that after 192 4 flowed from American capital to Germany unde r the Dawes and Young plans formed the founda tion upon which Hitler built his war machinery. As Dr. Anthon y C.

No dou bt it was decisive for the military preparation in Germany. There is ample p roof suggesting that the influential sector of American business not only knew abou t the n ature o f Nazism, but actively (and lucratively) suppo rted it for self- interest wherever possible, in the full knowledge that in the end there would be a war into which bo th Europe an d the U.S. would be d rawn... “To claim ignorance is incompatible with the facts. “The carefully researched e viden ce that American ba nking an d indu strial circles were most instrumental in the rise o f Hitler’s Third Reich is now pub licly accessible.

It has spread its ope rations to 9 3 coun tries and was a po werful economic and political force on a ll continen ts. It was known a s I.G.

By the beg inning of World War II, I.G.Farben ha d become the largest indu strial corporation in Europe, the largest chemical compan y in the world, and part of the most gigantic and powerful cartel of all history.” In 192 6 I.G. Farben had de veloped a method to extract petrol from coal and in 1929 e ntered a licensing agreement with Standa rd Oil (Rockefeller). This c ompan y gave I.G.

CH AP TER 32 ADOLF SCH ICKLGRU BE R AND THE ‘THU LE-GESE LLSCH AFT’ To throw some light on the mysterious “Third Reich” and the role of Adolf Hitler I have to go a b it further afield. All over the world Germ ans were – and since the last attacks on h omes for peop le seeking political asylum still are – linked to the Third Reich. But very few know the a ctual motives from that time. O ne he ars abo ut the “Aryan master race theory” and the “gassing of the Jews”, but not one percent know abou t the origin of these. In their schoo lboo ks the German children a re told o f the evil Adolf Hitler who appa rently, supp orted by aimed p ropagand a and mass hypno sis, was the only culprit of those e vents. They are not told from whom he took his ideo logy, who had pu t him into h is position an d, abo ve a ll, who had finan ced him. Actually, 95% of the finan cial supp ort came from Jewish sources. Interesting, isn’t it? The Allies had quite intentiona lly removed o r forbidde n all the bo oks that could ha ve un covered this, and so toda y a d ark mystic veil li es upon Germ any’s recent past. Therefore I consider it more than necessary to shed some light into this dark area, even if some theo ries will be thought by some to b e outrageou s. At least here you find the “right stuff” to discuss later.

Steiner refused to allow occultist Trebisch-Lincoln a ccess to the “Golden Dawn”, a d ecision which later was held against him. In 191 7 the occultist BA RON RUD OLF VON SEB OTTENDORF, the Gurdjieff disciple KA RL HAUSHOFER, the ace p ilot LOTHAR WAIZ, PRELATE GERN OT of the secret “Societas Templi Marcioni” (The Inhe ritors of the Knights Templar) and MARIA ORSIC, a transcende ntal medium from Zagreb, met in Vienna .

Sebo ttendo rf and Haushofer were e xperienced travelers of India an d Tibet and much influen ced by the teachings and myths of those p laces. During the First World War, Karl Haushofer had made contacts with on e o f the most influen tial secret societies of Asia, the Tibetan “Yellow Hats” (dGe-lugs-pa). This sect was form ed in 140 9 by the Buddh ist reform er Tsong-kha-pa. Haushofer was initiated and swore to commit suicide shou ld h is mission fail. The contacts between Haushofer and the Yellow Hats led in the Twenties to the formation of Tibetan colonies in Germany. The four young peop le hope d that during these meeting in Vienna they would learn something abou t the secret revelatory texts of the KNIGHTS TEMPLAR and a lso abou t the secret fraternity DIE HERR EN VOM SCHWARZEN STEIN (“The L ords of the Black Stone ”). Prelate Gernot was on of the “Inhe ritors of the Knights Templar”, which to my knowledge are the on ly true Templar society. They are the d escendan ts of the Templars of 1307 who passed on their secrets from father to son – u ntil toda y. Prelate Gernot app arently told them abou t the ad vent of a ne w age – the change-over from the Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius. They discussed that our solar year – a ccording to the twelve revolutions of the moon – was divided into twelve months and thus the revolution of our sun a round the great central sun (the BLACK S UN of ancient myths) was also d ivided into twelve pa rts. Together with the precession of the cone-shaped prope r movement of the Earth du e to the inclination of the a xis, this determines the length o f the world age. Such a “cosmic month” is then 2,155 years, the “cosmic year” 25,860 years long. According to the Templars the next chan ge is not just an ordinary change o f the a ge, but also the end of a cosmic year and the start of an absolutely new one . By completing the 2 5,860 years the Earth is c hanging from the age with the weakest (Pisces) to the age with the strongest radiation (Aqua rius). Indo - Aryan d efinition calls this the end of the Kali Yuga, the age o f sin. All age changes have led to po litical, religious, social and also geological uphea vals of great impact. The time o f chan ge-over from the o ld to the new age is called in Mesopo tamian teachings the three “doub le steps of Marduk”, of 168 years duration, at the mid-point of which the ILU ray, the Divine Ray, is expected to reach Earth. The Templars did careful calculations and concluded that February 4, 1962 was the date the ray would reach Earth. This gave the mid-point of the 168 years change-over and the years 1934 and 199 0 as other important dates. The main p art of the d iscussions dea lt with the ba ckgroun d o f a section of the New Testament, Matthew 21:34. For there Jesus addresses the JEWS: “Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of G od will be taken away from you and given to a peop le who will produ ce its fruit.” The complete original text that is kept in the archives of the “Societas Templi Marcioni” says it even more clearly. But the point is: In that text Jesus actually names the “peop le”, He talks to Teutons s erving in the Roman legion and He tells them that it is THEIR peop le that He had chosen. That was what Sebo ttend orf and his friend s wanted to know for sure: That the Teutonic, i.e. the German peop le was c omm issione d to form the realm of light upon"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"98 Earth – in the “Land of the Midnight Moun tain” (Germany). The p lace where the ray would meet the Earth was given a s the Untersberg nea r Salzburg. At the end o f September 1917 Sebottend orf met with members of the Lords of the Black Stone at the Untersberg to receive the po wer of the “Black-Purple Stone” after which the secret society was named. The Lords of the Black Stone who form ed out of the Marcionite Templar societies in 122 1 and were led b y Hube rtus Koch ha d set as their aim the fight against evil and the building of Christ’s realm of light. This dark power they were to fight had revealed h imself in the so- called Old Testament through Moses and other medium as God, starting with the words by YHWH = JAHVE H = Jeho vah to Abraha m: “I am God Almighty!” In Hebrew: “Ani ha El Shadda i”, translated: I am El Shadda i – the “outcast Archangel (Shadda i El) – Sheitan o r Satan” (see the original translation of G ene sis 17:1, e.g. in : The Bible, New Internationa l Version). Sebo ttendo rf clearly recogn ized: The Shadda i, the God of the Old Testament, is the destroyer, the antagonist of G od. His followers therefore sought to destroy the Earth, Nature an d humanity. And the followers were the be lievers in Mosaic Law, the Hebrews. (Remember the tenets of the Talmud!) In the Gospel of John, 8:39-45, Jesus states this directly. There he ad dresses the Jews: ‘Abraha m is our father’, they (the Jews) answered. ‘If you were Abraham’s c hildren,’ said Jesus, ‘then you would do the things Abraham did. As it is, you a re determined to kill me, a man who ha s told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraha m did n ot do such things. You a re doing the things your own father doe s.’ ‘We are not illegitimate children,’ they protested. ‘The only Father we ha ve is God Himself.’ Jesus s aid to them: ‘If G od were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now am here. I have no t come on my own; but He sent me. Why is my language not clear to you? Because you a re unab le to he ar what I say. You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in h im. When h e lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. Yet because I tell the truth you do no t believe me!’ Toda y still many peop le na ively ask: But why then d id Hitler go a gainst the Jews? I hop e that the last few lines have shown you. I n the eyes of the THU LE-GESE LLSCH AFT , from which later emerged the DAP (Germ an Worker’s Party), the SS (Schutzstaffel), the Jewish peop le who had been charged by the Old Testament god JAHVE H to “raise ha voc on Earth” were the reason why the world was always c aught up in war and d iscord. The Thule peop le knew abou t the Jewish ban king systems, i.e., Rothschild and a llies, and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and felt it was their task to fight the Jewish peop le, but especially their banking and lodge system, in a ccordan ce with the Revelation of Saha ja, and to erect the realm of light upon Earth. Author’s Comm ent” As you can see, these peop le were just as incapab le to remedy the cause a s their Lord Jesus had told them how – to change the world with love for creation, for one self and for the neighbo r (and that neighbor can also b e o f ano ther race or religion). But they had relinquished self-respon sibility and gave it to a GUILTY on, a SATAN. Their hatred made them so b lind that they never realized that they used the same weapon s as the p urportedly satanic god Jahveh they wanted to fight. They shou ld ha ve known though that one cann ot achieve pea ce b y war. A circle formed around BA RON RUD OLF VON SE BOTTEND ORF that via the “Teutonic Order” in 1918 in Bad Aibling became the “THU LE-GESE LLSCH AFT”.

The Thule-Gesellschaft is its inner core was pea ceful in na ture, besides knowing abo ut the Illuminati and El Shadda i. It was Hitler who be came more radical. When Hitler had taken o ver the NSDAP , he prohibited the Thule and the Vril Gesellschaften a fter they had he lped h im to his position. Towards the end o f the war he contacted them again, especially the Vril-Gesellschaft, because o f their advanced techno logy and their special contacts. A short history of “THU LE” “ULTIMA THU LE” app arently was the capital city of the first continen t peop led by Aryans. This was c alled HYPE RBOREA and was older than L emuria and Atlantis (continents with advanced cultures s ince submerged). The Scand inavians have a tale of “Ultima Thule”, the wonde rful land in the high North, where the sun ne ver sets and the ancestors of the Aryan race d well. Hyperborea was up in the North Sea and sank during an ice a ge. It is assumed that the Hyperborean s c ame from the solar system Alderbaran which is the main star in the constellation Taurus, and that they were abo ut four meters tall, white, blond an d blue-eyed. They knew no war and wee vegetarians (so was Hitler). According to alleged Thule texts they were technically v ery advanced and flew “Vril-ya”, flying machines that toda y we call UFOs. These flying d isks were capab le of levitation, extreme speed s and the maneu vers known from toda y’s UFOs due to two coun ter-rotating magnetic fields and they used the so- called Vril power as ene rgy potential or fuel (Vril = ether, O d, Prana, Chi, Ki, cosmic force, Orgon..., but also from the a cade mic “vri-IL” = as the h ighest deity = god-like), i.e., they take"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"100 the en ergy from the earth’s magnetic field (free ene rgy) like the “tachyon converter” of Captain Hans Coler. When HYPE RBOREA began to sink the Hyperborean s are said to ha ve bu rrowed with hu ge machines gigantic tunne ls into the Earth’s crust and settled unde r the Himalayan region. The subterranea n realm is c alled AGHARTA and its c apital SHAMBA LLAH. The Persians call this land “Aryana ” the land of origin o f the Aryans. Here we shou ld mention that Karl H aushofer claimed that Thule was actually called Atlantis and – contrary to all other researchers of Tibet and India – h e said that the surviving Thule- Atlantean s were separated into two group s, a good one and an e vil one . Those who called themselves after their oracle Agharta were the good and settled in the Himalayan region, the evil one s were the Shamballah who wanted to subjugate h umanity and they went West. He maintained that the fight between the peop le of Agharta and Shamballah had bee n going on for thou sand s of years and that in the Third Reich the Thule-Gesellschaft as Agharta’s representative continued it against the representatives of Shamballah, the Freemasons and the Zionists. This perhap s was his mission. The head of this s ubterranean region h e said was Rigden Iyepo , the king of the world, with his representative upon the Earth’s s urface, the Dalai Lama. Haushofer was c onvinced that the land be low the Himalayas was the birthplace of the Aryan race, which he claimed to have confirm ed during his Tibet and India travels. The symbol of Thule was the swastika coun ter clockwise. Tibetan lamas and the Dalai Lama p ersona lly testified that peop le from Agartha were still li ving toda y. The subterranean land that is anchored in almost all Eastern traditions has spread over the millenn ia unde r all of the Earth’s s urface with h uge centers und er the Sahara d esert, the Matto Grosso and the Santa Catarina moun tains in Brazil, Yucatan in Mexico, Moun t Shasta in California, England , Egypt, Czechoslovakia. It seems that Hitler especially sought to discover the entrances to the subterranean world Agartha an d to get in contact with the descenda nts of the Aryan “God peop le” from Alderbaran-Hyperborea. In the myths and traditions of the subterranean world it is often said that the world’s s urface was yet to suffer a terrible world war (Third World War) which would though b e ended b y earthquakes, other natural disasters and a switching of the poles and the dea ths therefrom of two thirds of humanity. After this “last war” the several races of the inne r earth would reun ite with the survivors on the surface and that the thousand -year GO LDEN AGE (age of Aquarius) would be rung in. Hitler wanted to bu ild an outer “Agartha” or “Aryana ” with the Aryan master race, and Germ any shou ld b e its home. During the existence of the “Third Reich” two large exped itions were sent by the SS to the Himalayas to find those entrances. Further exped itions s earched in the Andes, the Matto Grosso moun tains in the North an d the Santa Catarina mountains in the south o f Brazil, in Czechoslovakia and p arts of England . Some a uthors claim that the Thule peop le believed that – qu ite independen tly of the subterranean tunne l and city system – the Earth was HOLLOW, with two great open ings at the po les. Natural laws were quoted, “as abo ve, so be low”. Since b lood , bod y or egg cells, a comet or an a tom all have a nu cleus and a hollow space surround ing it that is enclosed by a “corona radiata”, an en velope , and the actual “life” is taking place in the core, one has dedu ced that the Earth was built after the same principles. Druses confirm ed this, as they were ho llow and the “life”, the mineral and crystals, were in the interior. Therefore the Earth also ha d to be ho llow – appa rently agreeing with the views of the Tibetan Lamas including the Dalai Lama – an d had a nucleus, the Central Sun (also called the “Schwarze Sonne ”, the Black Sun) that gave the interior an even climate and p erm ane nt sunlight, correspond ing in the microcosm to the central sun o f the galaxy in the macrocosm. They maintain that the a ctual life in ou r plane t takes place in the interior – the master race lives inside and the mutants on the surface – an d that this was also the reason why we"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"101 wouldn’t find an y life upo n other plane ts of our solar system, because their inhab itants live inside. The main e ntrances are at the North and South po les through which the central sun is s hining and producing the aurora b orealis. In the interior the land mass was exceed ing the water m ass. The polar explorer Olaf Jansen and o thers s aid that the water in the interior was fresh, which could e xplain why the ice of the Arctic and Antarctic is made o f freshwater, not salt water. It is interesting to note that this v iew of the make-up o f the world is s hared and suppo rted b y the po lar explorers Cook, Peary, Amundsen, Nansen, and Kane and , last but not least, Admiral E. Byrd. All had the same, strange e xperiences contradicting existing scientific theo ry. All confirmed that after 76 degreed latitude the winds became warm er, that birds flew north, that they foun d colored and g ray snow w hich when thawed left colored pollen o r volcanic ash. The question arises: where do flower pollen or volcanic ash ne ar the North Pole come from, as not a single volcano is marked on an y of the a ccessible maps? Further, some o f the e xplorers foun d themselves in freshwater seas, and a ll say that at a time during their travels they had seen two suns. Mamm oths were found whose flesh was still fresh and whose stomach contained fresh g rass. If you a re further interested in the ho llow Earth an d the experience of the d ifferent explorers, some titles are listed unde r “Further Read ing” at the ba ck of this book. The “Hollow Earth” theo ry has so far remained just a theory to the pub lic, although some authors and e xplorers claim to have visited there and e ven – like Admiral E. Byrd – tad taken n umerous pictures. It canno t be den ied that all the Arctic explorers had ha d extraordinary experiences that so far canno t be e xplained , which po ints to something strange happen ing there. But the theory that the Earth had a molten core ha s equally remained just a theory. The fact remains though that the subterranea n man-m ade tunne l and cave systems do e xist. They can be foun d in a lmost any country of the world and b y the largely still existing light source (a g reen ish glow that gets brighter the deepe r one e nters the tunne ls), by the smooth walls and the u nknown machinery that was foun d in the Boynton Canyon in Sedona , Arizona , are witness to a technically advanced culture that existed millions of years before. Relevant literature is listed at the back. The myths of a “Hollow Earth” were eno ugh for the Thule peop le to go o ut to start a serious study of the pheno meno n. Therefore there was at least one exped ition to the Antarctic during World War II. (Details follow). To show that the story of the Aryan-Hyperborean s was not entirely invented I would like to mention two e xamples: When the Span iards und er Pizarro came to South America in 1532 , the n atives c alled them “ivicarochas” (white lords). According to their legend s there was a master race o f very tall white peop le who centuries before had de scended in “flying disks” from hea ven. They ha long ruled in some o f the towns and when they disappea red ha d promised to return. When the fair skinne d Span iards arrived, the n atives thought them to be the ivicarochas c oming back and therefore in the b eginning willingly gave them their gold. Similar occurrences took place when the first white travelers arrived in Tibet and other Himalayan regions. They were scrutinized in a stonishment by the Tibetans and asked why they came from BE LOW (the foot of the mountains) rather than from AB OVE as they usually did. It is a p ity that most Germans have ne ver heard abo ut these things, since the ideo logy of Nazi Germ any was based on the El Shadda i theme an d the resulting persecution of Jews, the Revelation of Isais, the knowledge of the Templars and possibly on the tales just told. All their actions including the Second World War were ba sed thereupon . There are two possibilities to dea l with this: You think all the leade rs of the “Third Reich” were mentally disturbed an d drug add icts and you simply ignore a ll of this or You try to find out whether perhap s something of all this is true a fter all."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"102 But to find literature abou t this subject you shou ld no t look in so-called “free” Germany, for the Allies had cleane d up very thoroughly after the war. The activities of right wing radicals in Germ any would justify the p rohibition of some of the literature that open ly and often crude ly calls for aggressive racism. But to truthfully rende r the po litical and religious events of the pa st and the present, this information should no t be supp ressed. Now enou gh of these mysteries. As I will show you, the leade rship of G ermany became very active be cause of these myths. In October 1918 Sebottend orf gave the lodge brethren KA RL HARR ER and ANTO DR EXLER the task of form ing a workers’ circle which later became the DAP (Germ an Worker’s Party). The Thule-Gesellschaft had a newspape r, the Volkischer Beoba chter which was s oon taken over by the NSDAP (Nationa l Socialist G erman Worker’s Party) into which the DAP soon developed . In the same month the young o ccultist and e soteriscist ADOLF HITLER (actually Adolf Schicklgruber, Hitler was his mother’s maiden na me) entered the Thule-DAP and a s a good spea ker attracted attention. In h is book The Spea r of Destiny, Trevor Ravenscroft describes what Hitler’s c hildhood friend WALTER JOHANN ES S TEIN, a later advisor of the Freemason WINSTON CHURCH ILL, also said: “Hitler, who a lread y at twenty was a close adh erent of mysticism, tried to reach higher states of consciousness with the help of drugs. The Vienne se bo okseller PRETSCH E, who was a follower of the Germany mysticism and the resulting theo ry of an Aryan master race, helped Hitler to set the founda tion of his future view of the world and a lso introdu ced him to the hallucinogenic PEY OTL a s a mean s to get mystic illumination. At this time Hitler also got acquainted with the PROTOCOLS OF THE E LDERS OF ZION which on ly strengthened h is objection o f the Jews.” As Hitler was a drug add ict alread y as a young man, it is no wonde r he used through h is whole life strong narcotics. According to the diaries of his persona l physician DR . THEODOR MORELL, Hitler had d ifferent painkillers, tranquilizers, strychnine, cocaine, morphine d erivatives and o ther drugs injected during all the six y ears of the Second World War. The Thule-Gesellschaft engaged Hitler as a speaker at election rallies. Later the a nti- Bolshevik and Thule-brother DIETRICH ECKA RT taught him how to write an d speak prope rly. Eckart made Hitler what he later represented. He introdu ced him into the Munich and Berlin scene s and Hitler ado pted the Thule views almost completely. In 192 4, when Hitler was imprisone d because o f the failed Munich pu tsch, Haushofer spent several hou rs with h im every day and pa ssed h is theories and p lans on. Among the books he supp lied to Hitler was Bulwer-Lytton’s THE COMING RACE which tale abo ut a highly developed subterranea n Aryan race is almost iden tical to the on e mentioned abo ve. In Bulwer-Lytton’s book s aucer-shape d flying ships play also an important role. A further book came to b e pub lished : Ferdinand Ossendo wski’s BEAS TS, MEN AND GODS which told of the legend s of Agartha and Shamballah. Hitler was c ompletely taken in b y the search for the subterranean realm and the Thule-Aryan race theory. HAUSHOFER and RUD OLF HESS took on the po litical edu cation of Hitler. In Land sberg Hitler used the theo ries of Haushofer, the thoughts of Rosenb erg and political propagand a and mixed it all together. Rudo lf Hess s upp lied the proper language an d wrote it on the typewriter. In this way Hitler’s boo k MEIN KA MPF (My Fight) was written. The role of mysticism and o ccultism in the “Third Reich” is shown b y the influen ce o f KA RL HAUSHOFER who was c alled “The Greatest Magician of the Germ an Reich”. He was s aid to ha ve a “proph etic gift” the a ccuracy of which he lped h im to quickly raise in the occult power circles of pre-war Germ any."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"103 Jack Fisherman wrote in h is The Seven Men o f Spandau that RUD OLF HESS was also completely taken in b y Haushofer’s thoughts and theo ries. The strange flight by Hess to England shows this. It was c aused by a d ream Haushofer had where he say “Rudo lf Hess walking through the corridors of English castles and brought pea ce between the two greatest Nordic nations.” Since Hess was c onvinced of the accuracy of Haushofer’s prophe cies he followed that dream withou t questions. How mush of the magic “equipment” of the Thule-Gesellschaft was used is s hown in the following text: Hitler took the Thule salute “Heil und Sieg” (Salvation and Victory) and made it into “Sieg Heil”. This s alute together with the raising of the arm is a magic ritual which is used to form voltes. Franz Bardon wrote more abo ut magic voltes and their use. Franz Bardon (aka Fraba to, 190 9-1958 ) was the German magician I knew most abou t. He had been offered high po sts in government by Hitler if he would he lp h im win the war by his magic faculties. Bardon shou ld a lso give Hitler the add resses of the other 98 “99 Lodges” – Hitler was a member of the Dresden lodge – that exist all over the world. When Bardon den ied h is help he was s ubjected to terrible torture. (Franz Bardon : Frabato). Magic rites were n ot only used in Germ any, though. The Victory sign of the English, the V- shaped fingers, was until 1940 on ly known to the h ighest of the h igh in high d egree masonry. When the h igh d egree Freemason WINSTON CHURCH ILL feared that England might fall victim to Hitler’s successful hand magic (the German salute), his mentor in magic, the Satanist ALEISTER CR OWLEY advised h im to counter it with the two spread fingers. The SS , also called the “Black Order”, was everything but a police troop . It was a p roper religious order of a h ierarchical makeup . The brutal N azi party as a ho ly order? In hindsight this s eems ridiculous, until one n otices that it wouldn’t be the first time in h istory that a ho ly order was respon sible for the most monstrous atrocities. The Jesuits, but also the Dominicans who ruled the Catholic Inquisition in the Middle Ages, are prime e xamples. The BLACK ORD ER was the p ractical realization o f the esoteric and o ccult belief system of the Thule-Gesellschaft and the later SS “Schwarze Sonne ” (Black Sun) not only worked closely together with the Tibetan colony in Berlin bu t also with a Tibetan order of black magic. Hitler was in constant contact with a “Guardian o f the Key”. He is s aid to have known the entrance to Agartha (Aryana ). On April 25, 1945, when the Russians foun d in a Berlin cellar the bod ies of six Tibetans lying in a circle, the one lying in the center wore g reen gloves. It seemed they had comm itted group suicide. O n May 2, 1945 , after the Russians had entered Berlin more than 1,000 bod ies were found who d efinitely came from the Himalayan region an d had fought along with the Germans. What in the world had Tibetans to d o here, thou sand s of kilometers from their country and in German un iforms? Coun tless numbers of young men had bee n trained b y the “Black Sun” during the Third Reich, initiated in the Wewelsburg and sent to Tibet to survive there an d to prepare for the great final battle at the en d o f this c entury. According to Franz Bardon , Adolf Hitler was also a member of a “F.O.G.C. Lodge” (Freimaurerischer Orden de r Goldenen Centurie, Dresden, G ermany = Masonic Order of the Golden Century) which is actually know as the “99 L odges”. There are 99 of these “99 Lod ges” in many places of the world, all with 99 members. Each lodge is presided b y a demon, and e ach member has his persona l demon. The dea l is that the de mon helps his person gain mone y and po wer, but his s oul is after death committed to serve the d emon. In add ition one member is sacrificed every y ear to the lodge demon. It will be replaced b y a new member. The members of the “99 Lodges” are a lso indu strialists and ba nkers of the highest caliber and toda y are more important than e ver. The “F.O.G.C.” or “99 Lo dges” are in my opinion the most dangerous, compared to which the “Church o f Satan” of Anton LaVey that the media write abo ut is harmless."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"104 Franz Bardon confirmed that Hitler and the Thule order were the outer tool of a group o f Tibetan magicians. Only [one ] who knows abou t those circumstances will unde rstand this sentence from a spee ch b y Hitler held o n Janu ary 30, 1945 : “In this battle again inne r Asia will not win, but Europe – led b y that nation that for one an d a half thou sand years has represented Europe a s v anguard towards the East and will continue to do so in a ll eternity: Our great German Reich, the German nation! (Max Domarus: Hitler – Spee ches and Declarations 1932 -194 5). There are a lso many myths abou t the whereabou ts of Adolf Hitler after the War. According to Franz Bardon an d Miguel Serrano s (former Chilean a mbassado r to Germany) Hitler escaped with the help of the “99 Lodge”. This is perhap s easier to unde rstand if one knows that Hitler used up to five doub les during h is tenure. A large Germ an newspape r wrote o n March 5 , 1979 that Hitler’s private p lane ha d been found in the jungle in South America. Joseph Grenier (The End of the Hitler Myth) also states that Hitler had taken o ff in h is plane from Berlin-Tempelhof on April 30, 1945 . Later, around the time o f the Nuremberg trials, it is said that Stalin a sked U.S. officials whether they knew w here Hitler was? If Hitler had died in Berlin in 1945 , why would Stalin a sk? If Hitler did survive, however, it is most probab le that he ha d availed h imself of the developments by the VRIL-GESE LLSCH AFT – which I will describe in the following chap ter – for leaving Germany. Whether Hitler died then or not – in the meantime he d ied an yway! On March 1 4, 194 6, Karl H aushofer had, since h is mission ha d failed, first killed h is wife and then committed “seppudu ” (hara-kiri) as the “Yellow Hats” had made him swear. The theoretical and practical buildup of the Third Reich on the Germ an side ha d been wholly initiated and steered by the Thule-Gesellschaft. The finan cing came from the internationa l ban kers. The womb from when ce it all came is still fertile, since the Thule-Gesellschaft or its offspring a re still with u s toda y. Another secret group that spoke o f the coming of an Aryan Savior and to which Herm ann Goering, the Nazi’s finan ce chief, belonged was the “EDELWEISS -GESE LLSCH AFT”. But here it doe s not concern us. CH AP TER 33 THE “VRIL-GESE LLSCH AFT” OR NOT ALL GOO D COMES FROM AB OVE The VRIL-GESE LLSCH AFT (VRIL Society) doe s not exactly fit or subject which ha s a more political slant, but it is indee d one of the most interesting secret societies that ever existed. Therefore is just has to b e mentioned h ere. In Germany there is not a single bo ok, or indeed an y material, to b e foun d that would show up an o rgan ization of this name; the Allies successfully removed it all. But as you will see, not all the material has actually disappea red. And I am very pleased that I can uncover this s ubject here, because you will see which “non -German” power circles have a n interest to keep these events from the Germ an peop le. In 191 9, Karl H aushofer founded a second order, the BRUD ER D ES LICHTS (Brothers of the L ight) that later was renamed VRIL-GESE LLSCH AFT. In this united the new Templar order DIE HERR EN VOM SCHWARZEN STEIN (DH vSS , the Lords of the Black Stone ) that emerged in 1917 from the Teutonic Order, and the SCHWARZE RITTER (Black Knights) of the Thule an d SS elite SCHWARZEN SONN E (Black Sun). To compare the THU LE and the VRIL-GESE LLSCH AFTEN, it is easiest said the Thule- Gesellschaft dea lt with material and po litical interests, while the Vril-Gesellschaft was more oriented towards the OTHER SIDE. But many concepts they shared, like Atlantis, Thule, the basic c onne ction between the Teutons and Mesopo tamia, but also the old sacred p laces like"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"105 the Externsteine (external stone s) or the Hausberg at Stronegg were areas of common research. In December 1919 a small circle of persons from the Thule, the Vril and the DH vSS met in a specially rented forester’s lodge ne ar Perchtesgaden (Germany). They were a ccompan ied by the medium Maria Orsic and ano ther m edium only known a s Sigrun. Maria had mediumistically received transmission in a secret Templar script – a languag e unknown to her – with the technical data for the construction o f a flying machine. According to Vril documents these telepa thic messages c ame from the solar system Aldeba ran which is s ixty- eight light-years away in the constellation Taurus. I would like to present here a short summary of the messages the Vril medium had received over the years and which formed the basis for all further actions by the Vril-Gesellschaft: “The solar system Aldeba ran has a sun aroun d which revolve two inhab ited p lane ts that form the empire SUMERAN. The popu lation of the Aldeba ran system is divided into the master race o f “light G od peop le” (Aryans) and several other human races that had developed b y negative mutation from the “God peop le” because o f climatic changes upon the p lane ts. The colored mutant races app arently are on a lower stage of spiritual development. The more the races intermixed, the lower the spiritual development of these peop le sank, which led to the situation that when the sun Aldeba ran began e xpand ing they could no longer maintain the space travel techno logy of their forefathers and could not leave the p lane ts by their own mean s. The lower races, totally dependan t upon the master race, had to be e vacuated and were brought to other inhab itable p lanets. Despite their difference all the races respected on e ano ther and did n ot interfere with ea ch other, neither the so- called God peop le no r the lower races. Each respected that the others just made their own developments (in contrast to what happen s on Earth). ”Around 50 0 million years ago the “light God peop le” started to colonize o ther earth-like plane ts, after the expan sion of the sun Aldeba ran and the resulting heat had made the original plane ts uninhab itable. It is s aid that in o ur system they first colonized the p lane t Mallona (also called Maldek, Marduk or – b y the Russians – Phaeton) which e xisted in the area of toda y’s asteroid belt, then between Mars and Jupiter. Mars was next. The proof for a h ighly developed race o n Mars is run by the well-known face o n Mars and the p yramid city which ha s been p hotographed b y the Mars probe Viking in 1976 . It is assumed that the master race o f Sumeran-Aldeba ran then also came to Earth for a first visit, witnessed b y the petrified impressions of a shoe found to b e abo ut 500 million years old, and squashed und er the hee l a trilobite, a little crayfish that lived then upon Earth and b ecame extinct abo ut 400 million years ago.” “The Vril peop le thought that later, when Earth be came slowly hab itable, the race o f the Aldeba rans landed in Mesopo tamia an d formed the master caste of the SUMERIANS which were de scribed a s fair, white God peop le. The Vril telepa ths also foun d that the Sumerian language was not only iden tical with that of the Germ an an d that the languag e frequen tly of German an d Sumerian-Aldeba ranian were a lmost iden tical.” We cann ot know w hether these statements abou t Aldeba ran were ba sed on facts, but the construction p lans and the technical details that the Vril telepa ths received – wherever they came from – were so accurate that they led to the most fantastic idea men e ver begot: the construction of a “Jenseitsflugmachine”, a “flying machine for the other side”! The concept of an “alternative science” emerged (toda y one would say “alternative ene rgy forms”). But they only started o n the project three years later. During this early pha se of “alternative science” or “alternative techno logy” Dr. W.O. Schumann of the Technical University in Munich, both a Thule and a Vril member, held a spee ch, a section o f which is reprodu ced here:"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"106 “In everything we recognize two p rinciples that determine the e vents: light and d arkness, good and e vil, creation an d destruction – a s in e lectricity we know plus and minus. It is always: either – or. “These two p rinciples – the creative and the de structive – a lso d etermine o ur technical mean s... “Everything destructive is of Satanic origin, everything creative is divine. Every techno logy based upon e xplosion o r combustion ha s thus to b e called Satanic. The coming new age will be an a ge o f new, positive, divine techno logy!” (from the German SS secret archives). At the same time the scientist VIKTOR SCH AUBE RGER worked on a similar project. Johanne s Kepler, whose idea s Schaube rger followed, had knowledge of the secret teachings of Pythagoras that had bee n adop ted and kept secret by the KNIGHTS TEMPLAR. It was the knowledge of IMPLOSION (in this case the utilization of the p otential of the inne r worlds in the ou ter world). Hitler knew – a s did the Thule an d Vril peop le – that the d ivine p rinciple was always c onstructive. A techno logy however that is based on explosion and therefore is destructive runs against the d ivine p rinciple. Thus they wanted to create a techno logy based o n IMPLOSION. Schaube rger’s theo ry of oscillation (principled of the o vertone sequen ce, mono chord) takes up the knowledge of Implosion. To put it simply: IMPLOSION i nstead of EXPLOSION! Following the ene rgy paths of the mono chord and the implosion techno logy one reaches the realm of antimatter and thus the cancellation of gravity. In the summer of 1922 the first saucer-shaped flying machine was built whose d rive was based on implosion (the “other-side flying machine”). It had a disk eight meters across with a second d isk with a d iameter of six and a half meters abo ve and a third disk of seven meters diameter below. These three disks had a ho le at the center of one meter eighty across in which the d rive, which was two meters forty high, was mounted. At the bottom, the central bod y was c one -shaped , and there a pendu lum r eaching the cellar was hun g that served for stabilization. I n the activated state the top an d bottom disk revolved in oppo sing directions to bu ild u p an e lectromagnetic rotating field. The performance of this first flying d isk is not known. But experiments were carried out with it for two years before it was dismantled a nd probab ly stored in the Augsburg works of Messerschmidt. In the bo oks of several Germ an indu strial compan ies entries und er the codena me JFM (for Jenseitsflugmachine) can be foun d that show payments towards finan cing this work. Certainly the VRIL DR IVE (formally called Schumann SM-Levitator) emerged from this machine. In principle, the “other-side flying machine” shou ld create a n extremely strong field around itself extend ing somewhat into its s urround ings which would rende r the space thus enclosed including the machine a microcosm absolutely independen t of the earthbound space. At maximum strength this field would be independen t of all surround ing universal forces – like gravitation, electromagnetism, radiation and matter of any kind – and could therefore maneu ver within the g ravitationa l or any other field at will, withou t the acceleration forces being effective o r perceptible. In June 1934 , VIKTOR SCH AUBE RGER was invited b y HITLER and the highest representatives of the Thule an d Vril Societies and from then o n worked with them. After the initial failure, the first so-called Germ an UFO also came out in June 1934 . Under the leade rship o f Dr. W.O. Schumann, the first experimental round flying machine, the RFZ 1 (Rundflugzeug I) was developed on the groun ds of the a ircraft factory Arado in Brandenbu rg. In its first and only flight it rose vertically to around 6 0 meters, then wobb led and dan ced in the air for minutes. The Arado 196 gu iding system was utterly useless. The pilot Lothar Waiz just managed someho w to bring it down to the g round , jump out and run away before it rippe d to pieces. That was the end of the RFZ 1, but the b eginning of the VRIL flying machines."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"107 Before the end of 193 4, the RFZ 2 was read y, with a Vril drive and a “m agne tic field impulse steering unit”. It had a d iameter of five meters and the following flying characteristics: With rising speed the visible coun ters became b lurred and the craft showed the colors typical of UFOs: depend ing o n the d rive setting red, orange, yellow, green , white, blue or purple. It worked – and it would meet a remarkable de stiny in 1941 , during the Battle of Britain, when it was used a s transatlantic reconna issance craft, because for these flights the German standa rd fighters ME 109 had an insufficient range. By the end of 194 1 it was pho tographe d over the southern Atlantic on its way to the German cruiser Atlantis in Antarctic waters. It could n ot be u sed as a fighter though. The impulse steering allowed it only chan ges of direction at 90 degrees, 45 d egrees or 22.6 d egrees, but that is exactly the right-angled flying pattern a ssociated with and typical for UFOs toda y! After the success of the small R FZ 2 a s a d istant reconno iter craft the Vril-Gesselschaft got its own test area in Brandenbu rg. By the en d o f 194 2 the lightly arm ed VRIL-1-Jager (VRIL- 1-fighter) was airborne. It measured 11.5 meters across, carried one p erson, had a Schumann -Levitator drive and a “m agnetic field impulse steering unit”. It reached speed s of 2,900 to 1 2,000 km/h. could change direction a t a right angle a t full speed withou t affecting the p ilot, could fly in an y weather and ha d a 10 0% space capab ility. Seventeen VRIL-1s were bu ilt and some versions had two seats and glass domes. Also du ring this time ano ther project was worked on, the V-7. Several disks were bu ilt und er this c ode, but with conventiona l jet engines. ANDR EAS EPP had de signed a combination of levitating d isk and jet propu lsion, the RFZ -7. The de sign g roup s SCHR IEVE R- HABE RMOHL and MIETHE-BE LLUSO worked on it. The RFZ -7 had a diameter of forty-two meters, it crashed on land ing at Spitzbergen, A second craft was later photographe d outside Prague. According to Andreas Epp this craft was to b e armed with nu clear head to attack New York. In July 1941 SCHR IEVE R and HABE RMOHL bu ilt a vertical take-off round craft with jet propu lsion, but it had severe shortcomings. They went on to de velop an “electro- gravitationa l flying g yro” with a “tachyon d rive” which p roved more successful. Then, Schriever-Habe rm ohl and Belluzo bu ilt the RFZ-7 T that was fully functiona l. The V-7 flying disks however were mere toys c ompared to the Vril and Haune bru d isks. Within the SS there was a group studying alternative ene rgy, the SS-E-IV (Development Group IV of the Black Sun) whose main task was to rende r Germany independen t of foreign oil. The SS-E-IV developed from the existing Vril drives and the tachyon convertor of Captain Hans Coler the THU LE DR IVE which later was c alled the THU LE TACH YONATOR. In August 193 9 the first RFZ 5 took off. It was an arm ed flying g yro with the od d name HAUN EB RU I. It was twenty-five meters across and carried a crew of eight. At first it reached a spee d o f 4.800 km/h, later up to 17,000 km/h. It was equipped with two 6 cm KSK (“Kraftstrahlkanh onen ”, power ray guns) in revolving towers and four machine guns 106 . It had 60% space capab ility. By the end of 194 2 the HAUN EB RU II was read y. The diameters v aried from twenty-six to thirty-two meters and their height from nine to e leven meters. They carried be tween n ine and twenty peop le, had a Thule Tachyona tor drive and nea r the groun d reached a speed of 6,000 km/h. It could fly in space and had a range o f fifty-five flying hours. At this time there existed a lread y plans for a large-capa city c raft, the VRIL-7 with a d iameter of 120m. A short while later the HAUN EB RU III, the show-piece of all disks, was read y, with seventy-one meters across. It was filmed flying. It could transport thirty-two men, could remain a irborne for eight weeks and reached at least 7,000 km/h (according to documents in the secret SS archives up to 40,000 km/h). Virgil Armstrong, former CIA member and Green Beret, writes abo ut G erman flying machines during World War II that could take off vertically and fly at right angles. They were"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"108 measured at 3,000 km/h and had a laser weapon (probab ly the so-called KSK power ray gun) that could p ierce four-inch armor. Professor J. Hurtak, UFO-logist and author of The Keys of Enoch writes that the Germ an were in the process of building what the Allies c alled “the wonde r weapon system”. Hurtak got protocols that described two e vents; the erection of a space city at Peen emunde and the en listment and transport to the U.S. of the best technicians and scientists from Germany. He a lso mentions the meticulous examination of the so-called FOO FIGHTERS. The CIA and the British secret service knew alread y in 1942 abou t the construction an d the use o f these flying ob jects, but they were off in their evaluation. Foo Fighters actually was the Allies’ name for all glowing German flying machines. Probab ly there were two inventions that actually corresponded to the term Foo Fighters: the Flying Turtle an d the Soap Bubb le. Two completely different objects that the Allies held for one. The FLYING TUR TLE was developed b y the SS -E-IV at Vienna -Neustadt. Its outer shap e recalled the shell of a turtle. They were un manne d probes that could cause disruption in the e lectric ignition systems of the en emy. They carried advanced “Klystronoh ren” (clystron tube s) that the SS called de ath rays. The ignition d isrupter did n ot work perfectly at the o utset; later follow-up versions did, however, and the UFO-logist will confirm that disruption o f ignition, the cutting of electrical power to equipment, is a typical sign when a UFO is near. Wende lle C. Stevens, U.S. Air Force p ilot during the Second World War describes the Foo Fighters as sometimes gray- green , then red-orange, they app roached his aircraft to abou t five meters and then stayed there. They could no t be shaken off nor shot down and often they caused squa drons to turn back to land . The SOAP B UBB LES that were a lso called Foo Fighters were something completely different, though. They were simple ba lloon s in which there were metal spirals that disturbed en emy radar. The success probab ly was very limited, disregarding the psychological effect. At the beginning of 194 3 it was planned to bu ild in the Zeppe lin works a cigar-shaped mother ship. The ANDR OMEDA DEV ICE of a length of 139m shou ld transport several saucer-shaped craft in its bod y for flights of long du ration (interstellar flights). By Christmas 1943 a n important meeting of the VRIL-GESE LLSCH AFT took place in the seaside resort of Kolberg. The two mediums Maria Ortic and Sigrun attende d. The main item on the a gend a was the ALDEBA RAN PROJECT. The mediums had received p recise inform ation abo ut the hab itable plane ts aroun d the sun Aldeb aran an d one b egan to plan a trip there. At a January 22,194 4 meeting between HITLER, HIMMLER, Kunkel (of the Vril Society) and Dr. Schumann this project was discussed. It was planned to send the VRIL-7 large-capa city craft t hroug h a d imension channe l independe nt of the speed of light to Alderbaran. According to Ratthofer, a first test flight in the d imension channe l took place in the winter of 194 4. It barely missed d isaster, for photograph s show the Vril-7 after the flight looking “as if it had bee n flying for a hun dred years”. The outer skin was looking aged an d was damaged in several places. On February 14, 194 4, the supersonic helicopter – constructed by Schriever and Haberm ohl unde r the V7 project – that was equipped with twelve turbo-units BMW 028 was flown b y the test pilot Joachim Roeh like at Peen emunde . The vertical rate of ascent was 800 meters per minute, it reached a he ight of 24,200 meters and in h orizontal flight a speed of 2,200 km/h. It could a lso b e driven with un conventiona l ene rgy. But the he licopter never saw action since Peene mund e was bombed in 1944 an d the subsequent move to Prague didn’t work out either, because the Americans and the Russians occupied Prague before the flying machines were read y again."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"109 In the secret archives of the SS the British and the Americans discovered – d uring the occupa tion of G ermany at the beginning of 1945 – photograph s of the Hauneb ru II and the Vril 1 crafts as well as of the Andromeda device. Due to President Truman’s decision in March 1946 the war fleet command o f the U.S. gave pe rmission to collect material of the German h igh techno logy experiments. Unde r the ope ration PAPE RC LIP German scientists who had worked in secret were b rought to the U.S. privately, among them VIKTOR SCH AUBE RGER and WERNH ER VON BRAUN . A short summary of the developments that were mean t to be p rodu ced in series: The first project was led b y Prof. Dr. W.O. Schumann of the Technical U niversity of Munich. Unde r his guidan ce seventeen d isk-shaped flying machines with a d iameter of 11.5m were built, t he so-called VRIL-1-Jager (Vril-1-fighters), that made 84 test flights. At least one VRIL-7 an d VRIL-7 LARGE CAPA CITY CR AFT APPA RENTLY STARTED FROM Brandenbu rg – a fter the whole test area had been b lown up – towards Aldeba ran with some of the Vril scientists and lodge members. The second project was run b y the SS -IV development group. Until the b eginning of 194 5 they had three d ifferent sizes of bell-shape d space gyros built: The Hauneb ru I, 25m diameter, two machines built that made 52 test flights (speed 4,800 km/h). The Hauneb ru II, 32m diameter, seven machines built that made 10 6 test flights (speed 6,000 km/h). The Hauneb ru II was alread y planned for series produ ction. Tend ers were asked from the Dorneir and Junkers aircraft manufacturers, and at the e nd of March 194 5 the de cision was made in favor of Dornier. The o fficial name for the hea vy craft was to be DO-STRA (Dornier STRAtosphe ric c raft). The Hauneb ru III, 71m diameter, only one machine built that made at least 19 test flights (speed 7,000 km/h). The ANDR OMEDA DEV ICE existed on the drawing boa rd; it was 139m long and ha d han gars for one Haune bru II, two Vril I’s and two Vril II’s There are do cuments s howing that the VRIL-7 large capa city craft had started for secret, still earth-bound , missions after it was finished an d test flown b y the en d o f 1944 . A land ing at the Mond see in the Salzkamm ergut in Austria, with d ives to test the pressure resistance o f the hull. Probab ly in March and April 1945 the VRIL-7 was stationed in the “Alpenfestung” (Alpine Fortress) for security and strategic reasons, form when ce it flew to Spain to get important persona lities who had fled there safely to South America and NEUSCHWABE NLAND (explana tion follows) to the secret German ba ses erected there during the war. Immediately after this the VRIL-7 is s aid to ha ve started on a secret flight to Japan abo ut which ho wever nothing further is known. What happened to these flying machines after the war? It canno t be e xcluded that a small series of the Hauneb ru II might have been bu ilt. The several pho tograph s of UFOs that emerged after 1945 with the typical features of these German constructions sugge st as much. Some say that some o f them had bee n sunk into the Austrian Mond see, others maintain that they were flown to South America o r brought there in p arts. It is c ertain though that if the crafts didn’t get to South America, the plans that did a llowed for new one s to b e built and flown there, for an important part had bee n used in 1983 in the “Phoen ix Project”, the follow- on p roject of the 194 3 “Philade lphia Experiment”. This was a telepo rtation, materialization and time travel experiment of the U.S. Navy that was more successful than you could imagine in your wildest dreams. There is enough material for another book, but it doe s not fit too well into ou r subject here. In 193 8 a German exped ition to the ANTARC TIC was made with the aircraft carrier Schwaben land (Swabia). 600,000 km2 of an ice-free area with lakes and mountains were"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"110 declared German territory, the NEUSCHWABE NLAND (New Swabia). Whole fleets of submarines of the 21 an d 23 series were later headed towards Neuschwaben land . Toda y abou t one hund red German submarines are still una ccoun ted for some equippe d with the Walter snorkel, a device that allowed them to stay submerged for several weeks, and it can be a ssumed that they fled to Neuschwaben land with the dismantled flying disks or at least the construction p lans. Again it must be assumed that since the test flights had bee n very successful some so-called flying saucers have flown d irectly there at the end of the war. Perhap s s ome may think these assumptions to be a bit on the d aring side, but there are strong indications that is may well have happened that way. There is a question why in 1947 ADMIRAL E. BY RD l ed a n invasion o f the ANTARC TIC, why he had 4 ,000 soldiers, a man-of-war, a fully equipped a ircraft carrier and a functioning supp ly system at his c omm and if it was a mere e xped ition? He had bee n given e ight months for the exercise, but they had to stop after eight weeks and high losses of plane s und isclosed e ven toda y. What had happened? Later Admiral Byrd spoke to the press: “It is the b itter reality that in the case o f a new w ar one had to expect attacks by plane s that could fly from Pole to Pole.” Further he added that there was an ad vanced civilization d own there that used their excellent techno logies together with the SS. Norbert-Jurgen Ratthofer writes abou t the whereabou ts of the Hauneb ru developments in his book “Zeitmaschinen ” (Time Machines): “The Hauneb ru I, II and III space gyros and the VRIL I space flying disk had d isappea red after May 1945 . It is very interesting to note in the context that after its nineteenth test flight the German Haune bru III is said to ha ve taken off on April 21, 1945 , from Neuschwaben land , a vast, officially German territory in the Eastern Antarctic, for an exped ition to Mars, abou t which there is nothing further known. One year later, in 1946 the many sightings that sudden ly occurred in Scand inavia of shining objects of unknown and definitely artificial origin caused a g reat stir among the Allies in East and West. Again one year later, in 194 7, and well into the Fifties, a rising nu mber of shining u nknown flying objects, doub tlessly steered b y intelligent beings mostly round , disk- or bell-shaped , sometimes c igar-shaped , so-called UFOs appe ared o ver North America..” The text goes on to say that as a rule these o bjects were un like the Germ an developments. I beg to differ. Good pho tograph ic material proves that the Hauneb ru II version e specially had been sighted very often since 1945 . If you ha ve wrestled with what is available in the UFO world for ten years as I have, that is a significantly high percentage o f the cases where persona l contacts with the peop le from the so-called UFOs were made, these were with especially beau tiful Aryan types, blond an d blue-eyed and that they either spoke fluent German or another language with a Germ an accent (for insiders I would refer to the Adamski case o f 195 2, the Cedric Allingham case o f 1954 an d the Howard Menger case of 1956 ). It is further said that color photographs taken b y a night guard in West G erm any in the Seventies exist of a landed and restarted flying d isk that had b oth a knight’s c ross and a swastika o n its hull. The flying machines just mentione d are well documented o n pho tograph s and films. There is the 6 0-Minutes documentary “UFO – Secrets of the Third Reich”. The American Vladimir Terziski gave a three-hou r spee ch at the September 1991 UFO conference in Phoen ix, Arizona , where he showed slides of Germ an saucers, construction p lans and subterranean German b ases.

Upon this German background it becomes eviden t that the news and media world controlled b y the Illuminati through the Anglo-American Zionist lobb y shirks no costs to keep the German citizens from r esearch in this area. The Question arises from where the Thule and Vril secret societies got their knowledge abou t the construction of these flying machines? Also their knowledge of gene techno logy in which a rea the Germ ans were a lso way ahead of other countries? According to Herbert G. Dorsey and other researchers they had , beside the construction plans the Vril-Gesellschaft had received through telepathic c ontact with e xtra-terrestrials, a non -terrestrial saucer that had crashed in the Black Forest in 1936 and whose unda maged drive had p roved a great help to the Germans. But there is practically no p roof of that, and no living eye witnesses are known. But these e xist in America, and in large numbers. For aroun d the same time the Americans recorded quite a number of crashes that could n ot be kept entirely secret. More of that later. Back to the political arena . Apart from the fact that I.G. Farben suppo rted Hitler, their cartel partner Standard Oil (Rockefeller) fanned the flames against the Nazis. The Ford Motor Compan y for instance helped to bu ild u p the American a rmy while a t the same time produ cing in Germany military v ehicles for the Nazis. Ford an d Opel (subsidiary of Gene ral Motors that is c ontrolled b y J.P. Morgan) were the two largest produ cers of tanks in Hitler’s Germany. Whatever the o utcome o f the war, these multinationa l compan ies had alread y made their cuts. Many enterprises followed this principle d uring the Second World War. Why is there n othing abou t all this in schoo lbooks or encyclopaed ias? Especially in Germany where the freedo m of the press is appa rently hono red an d the truth is taught? One of the reasons is that the Rockefeller Founda tion spen t US$ 13 9,000 in 194 6 to present an official history of the Second World War which covered up the whole story of the U.S. ban kers building up the Nazi regime as well as the o ccult and mystical background o f the Nazis.

The history of war as it is told in coun tless history books in Germ any, England, the U.S. and Japan ha s only little in common with the a ctual causes and objectives of that war. What is recoun ted is c ertainly correct, but half the truth ha s been o mitted. “The ‘picture pa inters’ of the controlled mass-m edia have a lso done a masterful job o f pulling the wool over the e yes of those whom they are suppo sedly ded icated to inform and edu cate. These pedd lers of deception ha ve been gu ilty of reducing the minds of the general pub lic to what has rightly been de scribed a s ‘a state o f impotent confusion’ regarding World War II.” (Des Griffin: Descent Into Slavery?) Slowly but surely the truth comes out now and a clearer picture o f what really occurred is emerging. What we know of the war are the historical dates. Who, when , where, with whom did what.

CH AP TER 35 WHAT HAPPE NED IN AMERICA? Most Americans did not want to get involved in ano ther war, but the Illuminati had differing views. The 32 nd Presiden t of the U.S., the hidden Jew FRANKLIN D ELANO ROOSEVE LT, descended from the famous Seph ardim- Jewish Delano -Family and the German Jewish family Rosenfeld, was a Grand Master of the Freemasons, member of the CFR and the Comm ittee of 300. One of his closer allies was BE RN ARD BA RUCH and for at least eight years he was c losely linked with COLONEL HOUSE . As one can see, the Illuminati had their m an a lread y in p lace, and this man thanked them be passing an unconstitutiona l law, namely that before the en d o f April 193 3 all privately owned gold had to be handed in at the ban k, failure to d o so resulting in a fine o f US$ 1 0,000 or 10 years imprisonment or both. Then gold was valued a t US$ 2 0.67 p er oun ce. After m ost gold ha d been collected, the gold price rose to US$ 35 p er oun ce. The insiders had their gold in foreign banks and later sold it at the h igher price, naturally. By giving the Japane se on November 26, 1941 an ultimatum by asking them to withdraw all their troop s from Indo china an d Manchuria, Presiden t Roosevelt provoked them to war. This is a h istorical fact, but a well-kept secret. Roosevelt’s ultimatum was deliberately kept from Congress until after the attack on Pearl H arbor. All agreed the Japane se ha d no other option that war. The Japane se themselves did a ll they could to a void a war with the U.S. The Japane se prime minister, PRINC E KE NOYE, repea tedly asked to come to Washington or Hono lulu to meet with Roosevelt and to try to find an alternative. Later he e ven prepa red to meet the demand s by the U.S., just to avoid going to war, but several times Roosevelt refused to speak with h im, since the war with Japan ha d been long since p lanned , as was the war with Germ any. At the same time Roosevelt told the American peop le: “While I am talking to you mothers and fathers, I give you one more a ssurance. I have said this before, and I shall say it again an d a gain an d a gain: Your boys are n ot going to be sent into an y foreign wars.” One is spee chless in front of such a b latant deception of the peop le. The American military knew from several sources that the Japan ese would a ttack Pearl Harbor first. The U.S. ambassado r in Tokyo, JOSEP H GREW, wrote in a letter to Roosevelt on Janua ry 27, 194 1, that in the case o f war between Japa n and the U.S., Pearl Harbor would be the first target. In August, Congress member DIES had given to Roosevelt not only the same information, but also the strategic plan of attack with a map. He was forced to silence."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"113 Further, the American secret service had succeede d in 194 1 to deciphe r the diplomatic as well as the military code s of the Japane se. Roosevelt and h is advisors knew the d ate, the hou r and the target in ad vance. AL BIELEK , one o f the two survivors of the Philade lphia Experiment told me that he had also been stationed in Pearl H arbor during that time, but one week before the a ttack he – together with h is brother – was pulled o ut, because they were meant to work with Nikola Tesla o n the Philade lphia Experiment. They were told at that time that they were taken o ut because of the impend ing a ttack, that they were too valuab le to d ie there. Pearl H arbor was told on ly two hou rs ahead an d therefore was ill-prepa red. It succumbed pitifully. That was exactly what Roosevelt wanted, for now he could call the Japane se “treacherous swine”, and the U.S. had to retaliate. To those who still don ’t believe that more is needed to b ecome president or chancellor than just being a good po litician, the following example will hope fully serve a s an e ye-opene r. It concerns the later President of the U.S., DWIGHT D. EISE NH OWER. To guarantee the success of this infamous intrigue the Illuminati neede d one or their devoted vassals to b e supreme command er of all the a llied forces in Europe. The p erson selected for the job was Lieutenan t Colone l D wight D. Eisenho wer. His c areer in the arm y is not just interesting, it is a fascinating study of what can happe n to an ordinary army soldier if he had the “right” peop le beh ind h im.

DALL that the story of Command er GEORGE EA RLE became known. Earle was a form er Governor of Penn sylvania, U.S. ambassador to Austria (1935 -39) and Bulgaria (1940 -42). Later he was Roosevelt’s persona l military attaché in Istanbu l when in the spring of 1943 the head of the German secret service, ADMIRAL WILHELM CANARIS came to see him. Cana ris s aid that an un cond itiona l surrende r as it was asked for by America an d England was una cceptable for the Germ an generals. But if the American President would indicate that he would a ccept an hono rable surrend er of the Germ an arm y this could b e arranged. The German arm y would then b e posted a t the Eastern front to fight there a gainst the app roaching Red Army. Soon after this meeting Earle ha d an e ven longer one with the German ambassador FRITZ VON PAPE N who made the same o ffer. At first Earle was not sure he ha d heard right, then he realized these men were serious, so he sent a message to Roosevelt. Nothing happened . He sent another one . Again nothing. When Canaris returned a few days later to hea r Roosevelt’s respon se, Earle couldn’t give h im one . Earle then sent a most urgent message to Washington, but again there was no answer. Neither Earle no r Cana ris could know that a capitulation of G erm any was not wanted. Roosevelt forbade Colone l Earle in a persona l letter of March 24 , 1945 , to say anything abou t this event. Once the Germ an army was driven from Rome the arm y led b y Gene ral MARK CLARK was kept back, although it could easily have gone o n to enter Yugoslavia, Vienna , Budap est and Prague.

CH AP TER 37 THE A MERICAN SUPP ORT FOR THE SOVIETS DUR ING THE WAR An important factor to he lp in unde rstand ing the e vents of war is a remarkable bo ok that is avoided a t all cost by all the b ig media, film produ cers and most libraries: From Major Jordan ’s Diaries. MAJOR R ACEY JORD AN was a veteran o f the First World War and be cause of his military experience got the po st of a “lend lease” agent and liaison officer to the Russians. The first two years he served in Newark, Montana (?) and from May 10, 194 2 in the United Nations Depo t No. 8, Lend Le ase Division, Newark Airport, Newark, New Jersey, Internationa l Section, Air Service Command ; Air Corps; U.S. Arm y. As liaison officer between the U.S. and the Russians JORD AN was s urprised abo ut the influen ce the Russian Colone l ANATOLI KOTIKOV had over Roosevelt’s aide HARR Y HOPK INS. Every time the Russians neede d anything, even special equipment, a call to Hopkins by Kotikov was all that was needed for a speed y delivery. Later Jordan noticed the black c ases that accompan ied a lmost all deliveries and he be came curious. How he later succeeded in open ing some o f the cases is an adventurous s tory. He found pap ers abou t nuclear fusion, a list of the material on its way to the Soviet Union, two pound s of uranium 92 and de uterium. At this time h e didn’t know w hat it all mean t. He wrote a d iary with detailed de scriptions of this and further events. In Siberia, a mone y plane ha d crashed which had carried printed p lates, pape r and other m aterials s o the Russians c ould print the same occupa tion mone y for Germ any as the Americans! Because of the “lend-lease” treaty Stalin received from the U.S. 20,000 aircraft, almost 40,000 trucks, twice a s many tanks as they had when war started, railway engines, cars, food a s well as s ecret material. Why had the U.S. helped the Russians to that extent during the Second World War? And these were just a few examples. The Illuminati created the red regime. They knew w hat they wanted. Soviet Russia was an obvious tool in their plan (protocols) to e nslave the whole world unde r a ne w World Order. CH AP TER 38 THE P ROTOCOLS HAVE TO BE FULFILLED And Japan was den ies its surrend er just as Germ any had been . The Japane se capitulated uncond itiona lly in March 1945 . In that month the Japan ese supreme comm and sent a note to the American e mbassy in Moscow, the Russian e mbassy in Tokyo and the Pentagon in Washington saying that the Japane se Imperial government would like an un cond itiona l surrend er. THE A MERICANS IGNORED IT! Why? Later they claimed that they were no t able to deciphe r it! But how then d id they deciphe r the d iplomatic and military code s before? We know the answer: The Japane se island had n ot yet been de stroyed. The big show w as s till to come. The B-29s c arried o ut the big “city rede velopment” in Japa n for the internationa l ban kers. First the destruction of Tokyo, then the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is s aid that many of the uppe r echelon in the Japan ese arm y were members of a mystical secret society called Black Dragon, but I know nothing more abo ut it.

Yet their governments are also chosen an d guided like pupp ets by the Illuminati. Later, when you see the members’ list of the different organizations this will become very clear. Many of the German politicians in government are just as much p art of this game a s are the Americans or the Russians. CH AP TER 39 WHAT WAS A CH IEVE D BY THE SE COND WORLD WAR? In h uman terms the war was an ab solute, unmitigated disaster. For the Illuminati it was a resound ing success. The Second World War with the estimated 30 million dead (Solzhen itsyn says 100 million) is c learly part of the worldwide reconstruction program of the Illuminati, the o bjective be ing the installation of Weishau pt’s “Novus Ordo Secolorum” , the New World Order. For the Illuminati Len in was the perfect man in Russia, in the po litical and p sychological course of events Communism had the role of the foil, i.e., the conspirators used Comm unism as the bogey man to force Western nations into agreements and commitments that ran a gainst their proper interests. At the b eginning of the Twenties, Len in told the world of the future p lans of the Illuminati: “First we will take Eastern Europe , then the masses of Asia.” This objective was reached a s a result of World War II. The larger part of Asia followed a few years later. The Vietnam deb acle was part of the cleanup drive where loose end s were tied. The Second World War brought the Illuminati even more. The large cracks in the old world order opened wide and the finan cial and social found ations of traditiona l morals were swept away. America, whose security was never endan gered before or during the war, was forced by the maelstrom of world po litics to give up its own po litics. The Second World War cost America 400 b illion US$ and ha d the nationa l debt rise to 22 0 billion US$. Because of this the U.S. was fully in the hand s of the internationa l bankers. That war paved the way for the foun dation of the UN in 1945 , whose head quarters are on land in New York dona ted by ROCKE FELLER. At least forty-seven of the found ing members of the UN were a lso in the CFR. The Un is the largest Masonic lodge in the world, as is s hown b y its emblem. Like the Great Seal shown on the one -dollar bill i t is a Masonic symbol. Like the Statue of Liberty was given to the American Masons by the French Masonic Order of the Grand Orient. What became o f the Nazi secret service, the Gestapo? William Bramley writes that the CIA had accepted the offer by REINH ART GEHLEN, the head of G erm an secret ope rations in Russia, to he lp build an intelligence network in Europe. Many former SS members were then part of G ehlen’s organization. It became a n important arm of the CIA in Western Europe and a lso form ed the ba sis for the Secret Service of the Fede ral R epub lic of G erm any. From the documents of the Nuremberg trials the CIA got inform ation abo ut the p sychiatric method s of the Nazis which de cade s later were to b e used in the infamous experiments abo ut consciousness c ontrol. INTERPOL, a private internationa l police o rganization for the fight against criminals and drug traffickers operating world-wide, was headed several times up to 1972 b y former SS officers. This is not half as astonishing if one knows that during the Second World War Interpol was c ontrolled b y the Nazis. CH AP TER 40 GERMANY DID N OT SIMPLY LOSE THE WAR !!!"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"116 To finish o n Germ any and World War II I will tell you something you d efinitely never read in any other book, something which will surely make you wonde r abou t what you a re told in your schoo l books and will question your present picture o f the world. As you know from history books, the German Reich never signed a pea ce treaty, because a pea ce treaty has to be signed by the leade rs of the nation. But Hitler probab ly went to South America an d anybod y else was dead o r gone as well. So Donitz, substituting for Hitler, signed a cease-fire treaty for two a rms of the Wehrm acht. And this c ease-fire was broken b y the Allies in their attack, led b y Admiral Byrd in 194 6, on Neuschwaben land , the German territory in Antarctica. They tried to get at the e lite o f them all who sure were smart eno ugh to have a ba ck doo r open – Neuschwaben land ! And since the Germ an elite, the Schwarze Sonne (Black Sun) and the VRIL- Gesellschaft was at that time and still toda y living in this particular area (at least some of them do), the Allied Troop s had been d estroyed within weeks. And be cause of the broken cease-fire, the Germ an Reich was again – an d still i s to this day – a t war with the Allies!!! You may wonde r, but this is an irrefutable and d efinite fact of which e very important, high- ranking German that I have met knows. If the Allies would h ave won in Neuschwaben land against the “Schwarze Sonne ”, they would h ave come o ut with it on e very front page in the world. But because of their defeat they kept it very secret. The same with their attack on Neuschwaben land in 1958 , when the Americans blew up two nu clear head s, one below the ice and one abo ve, to get access to the subterranea n Germ an base. But of course they failed, because the techno logy the Schwarze Sonne ha s down there is, as Admiral Byrd alread y said, “highly-advanced”. And so the Anglo-American Establishment with their Khazar-illuminated ba nkers’ backgroun d have been smart in keep ing the whole affair “top secret”. The Allies were very successful in their newspape rs and nowada ys with their Hollywood background to make the Japane se and the Germ ans look the “bad guys”, but in fact it is rather the oppo site that is true! Remember the attack on Pearl H arbor which ha s bee n staged b y the Americans themselves. Please check this information for yourself, making sure that what you will find o ut is based on your own research, and that it is the truth!! To this day, Germany doe s neither have a p eace treaty nor a cease-fire n or anything else. Germany has an illegal state installed b y the Allies – the Fede ral R epub lic of Germ any. If what I’m saying is true, there h as to b e some e viden ce that the Illuminati would ha ve some of their pupp ets sitting a t the top o f the German Federal R epub lic, like in the other nations, too. Well, one of them was Chan cellor Willy Brand t, a Jew, who’s real name was Herbert Ernst Karl Frahm, offspring of the famous Israelite family Frahm from Lube ck, Germ any. He was a memger of the Committee of 300 and the Bilderbergers. If the information of Mr. Rudo lph from Melle, G ermany who went to court against Mr. Kohl and the Jewish writer Jacov Lind is c orrect, Bunde skanzler (Chan cellor) Helmut Kohl is one of them too. According to them, his real name is Kohn . Lind states in his book The Inventor (Methuen , London 198 7): “The g reat-grandfather of the present Chan cellor of G erm any wrote h is name still with an “n” instead of an “l”, he was a doo r-to-doo r salesman from Buczacz. I have do cuments and proofs. A whole library of proofs in the strongroom at the Nationa l Bank in Vadu z.” The Khazar-Jewish grandp arents c hanged their name from Kohn to Kohl when they came to Germany form Galizia in Poland , to cover-up that they were Jewish. According to Mr. Rudo lph, Chan cellor Kohn /Kohl is also a member of the Bilderbergers, the Grand Orient Freemasons and the B’nai B’rith who be stowed upon h im their highest blood order, the Order of Joseph . Further, a Khazar Jew shou ld ne ver head the Christian Democratic party (CDU ) nor be e lected Chan cellor of G ermany."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"117 The Fede ral R epub lic of Germany is a substitute nation u ntil Germany has a pea ce treaty. An official N ATO law states that until that peace treaty has bee n signed , the bo rders of 1937 of the German Reich still app ly legally. Because of this NATO law, colonies of the Germ an Reich still exist in total legality toda y, like the “Colonia Dignidad” in Chile o r one in Argentina, 100 miles north o f San Carlos de Bariloche (size: 10,000 square miles!!). To und erstand what that mean s is exemplified b y the ex-foreign minister of the Fede ral R epub lic of Germany, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who tried to get into the Colonia Dignidan three times and ne ver got permission to d o so.

The same with the colony Neuschwaben land , which you will still find o n maps of the South Pole o f the 70s. So, because o f this y ou will now unde rstand the act of treason the ne wly installed Bunde skanzler Helmut Kohl perpetrated a gainst Germany when he handed o ver Neuschwaben land to the NATO (according to a NATO major who wants to b e unna med). ABS OLUTELY ILLEGAL!!! He handed 60 0,000 square kilometers of G erm an territory over to the en emy (which is exactly what they are again since they broke the cease-fire) – the Allies! And that is just what the IRS and the Fede ral R eserve system in the U.S. are, too: ILLEGAL! According to a Schwarze Sonne member, who claims to live in a subterranea n city in the German Reich together with abou t three million o ther Germans (in Janua ry 1993 !), they have ba ses all over the world. Besides several in the Ande s, the main one s are inside the Earth, in Neuschwaben land , Tibet and the Berm uda Triangle. Tibet had been attacked an d taken o ver by the Chinese, who then hu nted the monks, tortured an d killed them. Why shou ld an ybod y torture and kill pea ceful monks? Because the Chinese were looking for the Germans in the monasteries. But they didn’t find them in the usual monasteries in an d around Lha sa, because the Schwarze Sonne -Germans live together with the so-called Avatars high up at 18,000 to 23,000 feet who suppo rted them in the first place an d do so again u ntil the fulfilling of the prophe cy. The Chinese can’t go there, it’s too h igh u p for their arm ies. Besides that, the Schwarze Sonne in Tibet has access to the Inner Earth, for they have been living up there for more than 4 0 years by now, with the monks of the h ighest Tibetan lodge – the dGe-lugs-pa (Yellow Hats). And o f course they now have a ne w generation there, too. According to my source, the German Reich ne twork has an army of 6,000,000 soldiers and 22,000 flying saucers. They are read y to go any minute. They had interfered in the Gulf War. On the 12 th and 13 th Janua ry 1993 the Allies tried to destroy the German Reich’s s aucer base ne ar Baghda d where two h uge VRIL-7 are stationed . The two Saucers were ab sent on a mission, which was known b y the Allies. So they attacked the area with a ltogether 198 b ombers. 12 Tornado s and 22 F-4s were mean t to de stroy the German b ase. Guess what happened? After 3 ho urs and 45 minutes the Allies had lost 16 F-14s, 1 F-15 and 1 F-111. The Allies themselves had shot down one Iraqi plane o n a training flight (the pilot could bail out). This is proved b y some very clear photos I was s hown b y an Iranian secret service a gent (he showed me several pho tos with two VRIL-7s, with the Iraqi bann er on the bottom.

As the wound s in Europe slowly hea led, the attention of the pub lic went to the Near East, where the Zionists were e stablishing the state o f Israel in Palestine. England was s haken b y the murder of Lord Moyne b y two Zionists. At the 194 6 Zionist congress in Gene va terrorism was app roved a s a mean s to establish the Zionist state. Thus many terrorist organizations sprang up in Palestine to force the founda tion o f Israel. The two most important one s were the IRGUN ZVA I LEUMI of Mena chim Begin an d the STERN GROUP of Yitzhak Shamir. Since the blood shed b etween the Arabs and the English was getting worse the matter was put before the UN . O n November 29, 194 7 the UN decided to split up Palestine into two independen t states, and Arab on e and a Jewish one . We know the principle of dividing a state for domination from ancient Rome. The consequence of “divide e t impera”, divide and rule, is always a ne ver-end ing dispute. And that is what occurred. The d ivision caused e ven b lood ier unrest which caused the UN to draw back. The Zionists then proceeded to d ivide Palestine on their own au thority. The Stern Group an d the Irgun Zvai Leu mi (led b y Begin) storm ed the village Deir Yasin an d slaughtered a ll the peop le, as a warning against further resistance b y the Arabs. They threw the peop le into the foun tain in the middle of the village an d threw had grenade s after then to silence the screams of the dying. Most of the Arabs flew to the neighboring countries, except for a few w ho unde r Yasir Ararfat formed the PLO. The declaration o f independen ce b y Israel on May 14, 1948 spurred further unrest. Ever since that time the Near East has bee n a festering hotbed of hatred an d murder. But that corresponded e xactly to the aims of the Illuminati (Albert Pike’s Plan No. 3). What happened in this particular village sound s pretty much like what occurred hund reds of times in the Old Testament, all by the same group of peop le, and nobod y has ever been pun ished for it. Isn’t it interesting that you don ’t read abou t stuff like that in your schoo lboo ks, but abou t the “bad Germans”? May I be the case that somebod y who ha s the power uses the news agencies and the mass media for holding back information of “some” kind an d for giving out “other” inform ation in a rather unba lanced way? To say it more clearly, they use the mass media in a very clever way to hand the bucket to somebod y else? Who owns TV networks? Who o wns Hollywood? Who is always the “bad guy” in the Hollywood p rodu ctions? Of course the Germ ans. And who ha s never been called the “bad guy”?

The well-staged “Cold War” between the Soviet empire an d the West that followed made the Illuminati stronger in the rest of the world. The Korean and the Vietnam wars were set up so that the Russians and the Americans never m et directly. At the same time it justified their “nationa l security” set-up, viz, the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency), the NSA (Nationa l Security Agency) and the NSC (Nationa l Security Coun cil). The unde rcover operations by the CIA to topp le a ll the governments of countries that were not yet controlled b y the Illuminati and to replace them with illumined , I. e., controlled peop le started in the early Fifties. Some U.S. sena tors began to smell a rat and wonde red – a s did Sena tor McCARTHY – why there were so many communists holding h igh offices in the U.S. government. McCarthy founde d the “House Hearings on Un-American Activities” and he managed to u ncover some communist activities before the media d iscredited h im. This is the most successful and well-tried method to unseat troub lemakers . Later, McCarthy investigated the CIA. If he had reached a b it deepe r he might have been able to prevent the Kenned y assassination. The Committee o f 300 was alarm ed when McCarthy prepa red to bring William Bund y before the investigating comm ittee. His s ubpoen a might have un covered the good relations between the CIA and the British secret service. The RIIA then chose Allen Dulles to get McCarthy out of the way. Dulles ordered Richard Helms and Patrick Lyman to take care o f McCarthy. Eisenho wer gave an o rder to General Mark Clark (CFR member) to divert McCarthy’s attention from the CIA. He managed to convince McCarthy that there was a special supe rvisory committee checking into CIA activities. McCarthy then stoppe d his investigations.

What is c lear is that the young Presiden t was abou t to steer his own course strongly oppo sed to the mighty political and financial interest of the ES TAB LISHMENT. He was not a good “collabo rator”, and on e o f the reasons for the murder was the sacking of the overly powerful CIA chief ALLEN DU LLES – a fter the fiasco at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961 , shortly after he took on the job. Furthermore, he prepa red to call back s ome U.S. advisors from Vietnam. This order was issued in Octobe r 1963 . Another thorn in the flesh of the Illuminati was the plan to curb CIA military activities in Southea st Asia. O n July 18, 1963 h e had told Congress that he wanted to implement certain measures to remedy the ba lance o f payments deficit of the U.S. He wanted to suppo rt exports of indu strial goods and an interest balancing tax on foreign a ccoun ts of American citizens.

O n May 20, 1953 a further saucer of only ten meters across was recovered in Kingman, Arizona . Here there were four dea d beings who were b rought like a ll the o thers to the Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Hangar 18. As the Americans like to say: Reality is s ometimes strang er than fiction. [H: Well, that might be the “saying”, but mostly the “reality” IS only fiction.] After the first crash a lread y several secret organ izations were founded to dea l with the presence of UFOs. The most important one was the OPE RATION MAJES TIC 12 that was founded o n September 24, 1947 , by Presiden t Harry Solomon Truman and und er which a ll the other projects ran (MAJES TY is the code name for the Presiden t). Among its twelve members were Dr. Vane var Bush, the scientific advisor of the Presiden t, Defense Secretary Forrestal and later also Nelson Rockefeller, Allen Dulles, Head of the CIA, and J.

The groun d crews were unab le to ope n the craft to gain access. When it was opened (from inside) there appea red to b e only “bod ies” as to four of the beings but one remaining “almost” alive (as described b y military personne l). The “bod ies” were moved, as unu sual as it may seem to anyone who knows geograph y in this matter, to Edwards Air Force Base where one officer stated: “The o ld man (higher ranking officer) will shit his pan ts when he gets this one ..”. Afterwards the bodies were taken to Nellis Air Force Base at Las Vegas. The bod ies are still there and p eriodically show signs of “life” although there are no “vital signs”. Now, why do you suppo se there is not further m ention o f THIS craft? – it made the local news. Surely, as close to Area 51 a s it was groun ded, there would ha ve been some “inside” information. Next consider that on that same da y a craft was “down” in Texas and was ASAP removed to a non -active Air Force base. This downing was brought out immediately and announ ced on KTRH , one of the major station-channe ls in Houston, Texas. Why does this not get mentioned in such journals as Mr. Coope r’s?

The committee recommende d to the Presiden t strict secrecy for reasons of ‘nationa l security’. The p lace where Eisenho wer was to make contact was the Edwards (MUR OC) Air Force Base in California.

He was murdered a t Dallas on November 22, 196 3. The first shot actually did come from the roof of the storehou se, but it was not lethal. The killing shot came from the driver of the Presiden t’s limousine. A CIA agent who shot Kenned y in the head with a special weapon de veloped b y the CIA. If you look at the original film of the a ssassination in slow motion and watch the driver, then you can clearly see that he turns around with a gun in h is hand , shoo ts, and the ba ck of Kenned y’s head b ursts. The films shown in most Western coun tries have the driver cut out. On November 21, 1993 , the German TV channe l ARD sought in its program Spiege l -TV in a ridiculous way to tell the viewers that there was no CIA involvement in the assassination, at almost the same time RTL showed a p rogram claiming the oppo site. Apart from the differing commentaries both p rograms s howed the film only once full-frame, afterwards the driver was again cut out. But in the full-frame version the shooting d river and the gun were clearly v isible to those who knew w here to look. John Lea r, the son of the founde r and toda y owner of Lea r Aircraft and on ce de corated as the be st pilot of the U.S. Air Force (seventeen world records), found three o riginal films, e.g. in Japan , that he had computer ana lyzed and checked for authenticity.

The computer analysis also a llowed to recognize the weapon a s a special caliber developed b y the CIA. The bu llet, too, was a CIA special that only exploded a fter entering the bod y and thus ann ihilated Kenned y’s brain. The assassination was prepa red by the CIA members Orlando Bosch, E.

Many of these facts had been un covered during the special hea rings by the committee for assassination, but according to U.S. security law they remain secret until 2029 . After the hea rings the CIA was prohibited from und ertaking an y unde rcover operations within the U.S. [It is] hard to believe that they ever followed that order. All the witnesses of the conspiracy were e ither killed o r died of fast-growing cancer that they had injected – the dead ly marksman in the car three weeks after the deed , for example. The o fficial story of the Kenned y assassination a ccording to the repo rt by the Warren Comm ission was that LEE HARVEY OSWALD had bee n the only person respon sible, and it was printed n ine hou rs later in all newspape rs of the U.S. The true story of the CIA- Comm ittee of 300 conspiracy was never told.

A part of the Illuminati’s plan was fulfilled. But what abou t Roman Catholicism? At first glance on e would think that seventeen centuries of stability would no t easily be shaken, but a closer look show different. The Vatican’s s ecret service ha s always been the SOCIETY OF JES US, whose members are called JES UITS. I would like to open the e yes a bit of those who be lieve that Jesuits were just ano ther harm less religious organization. The initiation o ath for the 2 nd deg ree demand s the dea th o f all Protestants and Freemasons. They were the lead ing force beh ind the massacre of the Huguen ots and were a lso respon sible for the behead ing of countless Protestants and Freemasons in England du ring the 16 th and 17 th centuries. The Society of Jesus was founde d in 1534 b y IGNATIUS LOYOLA who was of JEWISH descent as were the first three gene rals of the order. The power of the gene ral of the Jesuits is s uch that he is c alled THE BLACK P OPE . During the Second World War, the Catholic Church was hea vily infiltrated by other secret lodges. Among o thers those were the OSS (precursor of the CIA), the MI6, the Italian BLACK NOBILITY, Freemasons and the P2 Lo dge (Propaganda Due) who a ll were protected b y the Comm ittee of 300 . The P2 is the strongest of the Italian Masonic Lod ges. Within the P2 is the GREAT VATICAN LODGE, which was at the root of the P2 scanda l in 1976 , when a list surfaced in the Vatican with the n ames and entry dates of 121 high Church dignitaries, among them cardinals of the Curia, archbishop s, bishop s, prelates and laymen. Instead o f calling these persons to a ccoun t, a veritable witch-hun t was instigated against those who pub licized the list! No commentary necessary, right? Among the n ames on the list were a lso those of the secretary of state cardinal Jean Villot, the Vatican’s Foreign Minister Agostino Casaroli, cardinal Seba stiano Baggio, cardinal Ugo Poletti and the hea d o f the Vatican Bank, Bishop Marcinkus."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"126 As s tated previously, the Illuminati always s uppo rted both sides of nations engaged in war. By the end of World War II this became more e viden t. Allen Dulles, hea d o f the CIA, for instance, had a secret meeting with the SS leade r Gehlen. They made arrangements to smuggle SS officers und er the cover of the Catholic Church into Switzerland . Some SS officers took their vows and were po sted in o ther coun tries, predo minan tly Argentina, Paraguay, and the U.S. After the war it was Gehlen’s task to organize the station RADIO FREE E UR OPE . After the war a large section of the SS was directly taken o ver by the CIA. Another interesting member of the Committee o f 300 was J oseph Retinger. After the war the CIA suppo rted him in making contracts with the Vatican. For instance, he won o ver Dr. Luigi Gedda , the medical advisor of Pope Pius VII and leade r of Catholic activities. With Gedda ’s help h e succeede d in strengthen ing for the future the conne ction with Pope Paul VI who had a lread y collabo rated with the OSS (Office o f Strategic Services). Retinger also met with Prince Bernha rd o f the Netherland s, the Italian p rime minister, Sir Colin Grubb in, director of the SOE (Special Operations Executive, British Secret Service), and CIA director Gene ral Walter Bede ll.

This group was the core that met at the h otel D e Bilderberg in Oosterbeek, Holland for the first time in May 1954 and later became known a s THE BILDERBE RGERS. Committee of 300 member Prince Bernhard o f the Netherland s became the first director of the Bilderbergers. (Explana tion later). One of the CIA members with a strong influen ce in the Vatican was Cardinal Spellman. He helped the CIA with the overthrow of democracy in Guatemala in 195 4. It was also Spellman who introdu ced Father Paul Marcinkus from Chicago to the Pope. In 1971 , Marcinkus became archbishop an d head of the VA TICAN BA NK. Marcinkus developed close links with Masonic P2 lodge members Michele Sindona and Robe rto Calvi. The grand master of the P2 was Licio Gelli. Calvi who headed the BA NC O AMBROSIANO helped the Vatican to transfer more than 10 0 million US$ to the Polish Solidarnose movement. Later he was involved in the h uge Banco Ambrosiano scanda l. In 1982 h is bod y was found han ging from the London Blackfriars bridge. He had bricks in h is left and right pockets and his legs were tied at a right angle. This a Masonic ritual murder. This peculiarity was never written abou t in the newspape rs. Sindona be came advisor to the Vatican Bank. The P2 lodge ha d many links with the Vatican, O pus Dei and the CIA. Many of its members held high offices in the Italian go vernment. In Janu ary 1966 LOO K magazine pub lished the article “How Jews Chan ge the Thinking of the Catholic Church”. The Vatican probab ly is the richest organization in the world. A large portion of its fortune is held b y the Rothschild ban ks. There is no dou bt that the Vatican over the years has bee n taken o ver by the Comm ittee o f 300 . This also e xplains why Bush, Gorbachev and other leade rs s o o ften visit the Pope.

In 198 2 the lead ing ba nks of Wall Street and the U.S. government together agreed to set opp ressive repa yment cond itions for each indeb ted n ation which then was arranged b y KISS INGER AS SOCIATES INC.

The IMF, the Fede ral Reserve Bank and the Bank of England a re planned a s a kind o f “world po lice” to recover debts. The idea to put the IMF and its opp ressive cond itions at the center of all negotiations of deb ts stemmed from America. The cond itions of the IMF are laid be fore the different nations as a kind of lure. O ne knowledge abou t a country and its difficulties has been gathered, that country is then told what definitely has to be changed. Then the deb tor country is told if it ever wants to get any credit with a foreign ba nk, it will have to limit its imports to the a bsolute n ecessities, lower state e xpend iture and abo ve a ll stop subsidizing staple food an d other suppo rt programs for the socially weak. The most important demand was to de valuate the currency. Apparently this would make exports cheape r and hen ce more attractive on the world market.

Later, during the 19 th century, when Rothschild ha d alread y taken over the Bank of England , they started using the Jewish REUTERS news agency to that aim. News agencies like the WOLFF in Berlin an d the French HAVAS had the same goal: to build an internationa l news monopo ly. The CFR (Coun cil on Foreign Relations) and the RIIA (Royal Institute for Internationa l Affairs) both were founded b y the Round Table to widen its s phe re o f influen ce. The RIIA had been a brainchild of Cecil R hode s (British-South African statesman and diamond milliona ire) who wanted to extend British sovereignty all over the globe , but especially to the U.S. A possibility to control the masses is the “social cond itioning” of the RIIA mentioned previously. They trained the military technician JOHN R AWLINGS REES who later opened the TAV ISTOCK INSTITUTE FOR HU MAN STUD IES in Sussex, England . The Tavistock Institute is the center of England ’s psychological warfare, Tavistock method s have bee n used, as mentioned , in England an d in America. Besides the press, radio an d movies have been u sed for mass manipulations that – as they have been u tilized for decade s already – can no w be called brainwashing. The CFR shares respon sibility for the found ing o the UN which serves the form er as a tool for reaching the New World Order, the One World Government. According to documentation held b y SP OTLIGHT and other sources I have mentioned in the course of this book, toda y the CFR – together with the Trilateral C ommission – controls the U.S. government 100 %. The lead ing positions at all news agencies and most news media a re occupied by CFR members. These are Reuters, Associated Press, United Press, Wall Street Journal, Boston Globe , New York Times, Los Ange les Times, Washington Post , AB C, NBC, CBS and RC A.

The Illuminati order Skull & B one s forms the inner circle of the CFR and thus brings more media o n line: Time-Life, Nationa l R eview, Minneapo lis Star, Atlantic Monthly, Fortune , etc. In 188 0 the Skull & B one s had a lread y gained considerable influen ce on the edu cationa l and schoo ling system. Timothy Dwight was the first presiden t of Yale University: both the Cornell and John s Hopkins Universities were a lso headed by Skull & B one s members. So was McGeorge Bund y who a s s ecurity advisor of Kenned y and John son helped to run the Vietnam war and was dean of Harvard University. Every historical information that goes against the guidelines of the American History Society and thus against the Skull & B ones is not admitted for teaching. The same, of course, also happe ns in Germany and in every other coun try of the world. In Russia, and the GDR the teaching followed comm unist, i.e. illumined , lines in Arab an d Jewish coun tries according to their respective interests. The main thing was not to edu cate peop le to themselves, to independen t thinking, judg ing and a cting. In 194 6, the ROCKE FELLER FOUND ATION had spen t 139 ,000 US$ to present an official version of the Second World War that covered u p the bu ilding of the Nazi regime b y the Khazar-Jewish U.S. ban kers. O ne of the main sponsors of the fund s was Rockefeller’s own Standa rd Oil C orp. The Ford Founda tion originally was s et us with fund s from the Ford Motor Compan y but eventually it, t oo, was infiltrated by Skull & Bone s members who u sed the Founda tion’s fund s for the stupefaction of both schoo l system and the pub lic. The present schoo l systems of the Western nations are controlled b y the Illuminati and their branches. Most organizations pub lishing schoo lbooks are indirectly finan ced by the Illuminati. McGeorge Bund y, nationa l security advisor during the Vietnam War, became presiden t of the Ford Found ation in 196 6 and chose Skull & B one s member Harold Howe II for vice- presiden t. The latter was respon sible for the research an d edu cation sections. The abno rm al expend itures forced the Ford family to resign. The psychological warfare techniques that were instigated in WELLINGTON HOUSE and perfected at the TAVISTOCK INSTITUTE FOR HU MAN STUD IES are described b y Edward Bernay as follows: “The popu lation growth was paralleled b y the Illuminati’s efforts in the area of control of mass consciousness. Than ks to the news age ncies, the press, newspapers, telephone , radio and a ircraft that are a ll controlled b y the Illuminati, idea s and op inions c an quickly be spread o ver the whole coun try. The conscious and intelligen t manipulation of the beha vior and op inion o f the masses is one of the most important elements of the de mocratic society. Those who u se these mechan isms are the p owers actually ruling the world.” There can be n o doub t abo ut the importance of the role the media p lays toda y. Television, for instance, shows c learly how negative messages like the new horror and violent movies influen ce the beha vior of the viewers. Predo minan tly though televison is used to influen ce op inions abo ut how to think, to a ct and to look.

In h igh frequency recording the message is added at frequen cies that the ear can n o longer hea r but that are still subliminally unde rstood b y the subconscious. In ba ckward masking the messages are recorded backwards and can a gain be integrated by the subconscious. If the tape s are played ba ckwards, the messages become aud ible.

Queen Song: Crazy Little Thing Called Lo ve Message: To hell with the b ible! All I want is magic! Police Song: Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic! Message: The evil have p ower!

He says that the original matrices of every recording – classical, coun try, rock, standa rds, meditation music, disco, folklore...anything (not just rock and hea vy metal) – were subjected to a black magic ritual cond ucted by thirteen peop le a nd beset by demons. These peop le don ’t do this for finan cial gain b ut to control the spirit of the peop le.

From the ZODIACO later emerged a second compan y in California called MARANTA. This project was aimed at catching a lso the young Christians and peop le of other faiths. So band -names with po sitive a llusions were chosen, and positive lyrics, but the matrices were nevertheless c harged with satanic and de structive messages. Their first project was J ES US CHR IST SUPE RSTAR. As you can see names don ’t mean a thing, and the subject of music cann ot be treated supe rficially. It doe s not matter whether the messages are satanic or urging to buy, the fact is that these peop le, and there are lots of them, act against the free will of others. But there are ways and mean s to protect one self and to learn ho w to hand le this problem. For peop le still have the freed om to choose the music to which they are listening. The mass media a re the premier tool for keep ing the pub lic ignorant . That is the reason why practically nobod y knows the true stories beh ind po litics, economy and religion. Thes same goes for the history of man, his true origins, the structure o f the Earth (especially the inside), the a ctual state of the Moon and Mars, the real space program, free en ergy, natural hea ling, spiritual hea ling, the true life of Jesus, the bod y of light of man (his soul and a ura), his geometric magnetic field (the Merkaba h) and extraterrestrials with their techno logy. Not even one pe r thou sand of all Germ ans ever hear abo ut the construction of flying machines in their own coun try! Think abo ut this, seriously! Here I would like to quote a passage from Hesemann ’s UFO – The Contacts , where he explains why the subject of UFOs is s till treated by the media a s non sense: “The n umber of sightings was stead ily rising, and it looked as if the invasions was never going to en d. In June 1952 a lone 250 sighting had bee n reported to the Air Force. The UFO investigation p roject of the Air Force, BLUE B OOK, had no w 2,000 cases documented of which 25 % are classed UN KNOWN. Thus the pheno meno n has reached a d imension that became interesting for other agencies, too. By September the almighty and infamous CIA joined the o fficial investigation, to “check” whether the problem of flying saucers was endan gering na tiona l security and whether upon this question ap propriate research and investigations were ne cessary. A number of documents from that time ha ve been released in 1977 b y Presiden t Jimm y Carter (see: UFOs – The Proofs ). On September 11, 1952 , Marshall C hadwell, vice-director of the scientific depa rtment of the CIA, told the director that a worldwide repo rting system had bee n ordered to intercept unknown flying objects. Flying saucers bea r two kinds of danger. The fires is the p sychological effect upo n the masses and the second the vulnerability of the U.S. air space. For practical reasons ‘we"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"132 recommend to define a policy abou t what the popu lace may be told abo ut these pheno mena .’ In the words of Major Kehoe this mean t ‘a cunn ing and ruthless c ensorship to stamp o ut pub lic belief in UFOs’. To this end the CIA arranged a meeting of Air Force pe rsonne l and scientists at the Pentagon to secretly ana lyze the material proving the UFOs. This meeting took place on Janu ary 14 to 1 8, 195 3, hea ded b y Dr. H.P. Robertson from the University of California, after whom it has bee n named the ROBE RTSON PA NEL. The time was well chosen. In the previous November a ne w, Repub lican Presiden t had bee n elected, Gene ral Dwi ght D. Eisenho wer. At the end of Janua ry, Eisenho wer was going to be sworn in. Until then they had to recommend to the Presiden t a new successful policy. On November 18, 1952 , alread y CIA director Admiral R oscoe Hill enkoetter had declared in an instruction pape r for the Presiden t-elect abou t the subject of UFOs: “Implications for nationa l security are mainly given b y the fact that motive an d final intentions of the visitors are still completely unknown. This is c ompounde d by the marked rise of reconna issance flights by these ships in the time between May and a utumn of this y ear which ha ve led to the concern that something n ew might be afoot. For these reasons, but also for obviously internationa l and techno logical reasons and the utmost necessity to prevent pan ic at all cost, the Majestic-12 comm ission un ivocally maintains that severe security measures will also ha ve to b e implemented without interruption b y the n ew administration. “...On the last day the pane l ado pted a ‘pub lic edu cation p rogram’ suppo rted b y all government age ncies c oncerned with two main objectives: Educate an d trivialize. The a im of trivialization was to redu ce pub lic interest in ‘flying saucers’ and could be accomplished via the mass media like television, movies and artlcles. The ba sis would be a ctual cases that would first cause confusion, but would then b e explained . And a s with magic tricks , there is sc ant interest once the trick has bee n revealed. The n ationa l security c oun cil was to start imm ediately the necessary action to strip the uniden tified flying ob jects of the special status, the aura of the mysterious, they enjoy. “’We ha ve been ordered to collabo rate in a country-wide disclaiming campaign,’ Air Force spea ker Albert M. Chop said, ‘to pub lish articles in n ewspapers and to g ive interviews to ridicule UFO repo rts.’ Captain Ruppe lt add s: ‘And that was not the worse. We were ordered to keep sightings s ecret, if at all possible, or, if a story had got out prematurely, to explain it away (weather balloon , meteorite, cloud , forgery...the a uthor) – in an y case to do everything possible to remove it. If we could no t find a p lausible e xplana tion, we were just to ridicule the witnesses.’ During the following months both Chop and Ruppe lt resigned from the Air Force. “The CIA policy of trivializing o r ridiculing was only too successful. Just how successful w e learn from an ope n letter by the initiative ‘Justice for Military Personne l’ (J.M.P.) of September 4, 198 7 to then President Reaga n: ‘The na tiona l U FO t rivialization campaign ordered by the CIA in 195 3 fabricated boo ks and infiltrated the press with hund reds of articles to surroun d the subject of UFOs with an a ura of ridicule through false contacts and obvious UFO swindles. This ongo ing campaign ha d CIA agen ts infiltrate civil U FO research group s to ridicule them by certain manipulations or to gu ide their efforts towards ‘other explana tions’. This c over-up policy was more successful than the CIA ever expected, than ks to the brilliant manipulation of the press with the strategy of ridicule. The established press, for fear of ridicule, proved to be only too gullible towards ‘official statements’.” NATO Major Hans C. Peterson writes abo ut the reasons for this massive po licy of secrecy: The monetary system would collapse – no p ower group would a llow that.

Who will trust political leade rs any more once it becomes clear that they have bee n lying to us for decades just to keep their power? Mathias Becker of the Berlin da ily TAZ put this very succinctly in an a rticle abou t the Frankfurt UFO Conference of 199 0: “...today as then the governments of the world ha ve no interest for reasons of self preservation to a cknowledg e the presence of a technically and spiritually s uperior cosmic authority.

Not a soul, and therefore UFOs will have to be treated on a level with the Lo ch Ness monster – the existence of extraterrestrials is s ubversive and radical and overturns everything that 2,000 years of scientific endeavor and e volution research have g athered a s ‘bare facts’. And who of the so-called ‘crown of Creation’ wants to a ccept that the supe rnatural perhap s is not so supe rnatural after all, but plainly and clearly s ubna tural.” To end with the subject of UFOs I can just repe at: Find the truth, for the truth will set you free! Another example is the very secret CIA project MK-ULTRA which ha s been u sed in the Fifties by American p sychologists and sociologist to ascertain the effects of mind-altering drugs. They now no longer experimented with guinea -pigs, but with stude nts at U.S. universities.

Almost all of the then 80 0,000 citizens felt some of it. Toda y, it is known that Serratia bacteria causes a kind of pne umonia that can be dead ly. The army further disclosed that between 1949 and 196 9 a total of 239 tests in the ope n had been carried ou t, eighty of which were with germs, that makes four attacks per year on American cities, and that for twenty y ears! According to CIA reports, during the same period and independen tly, the agen cy also b ombarded towns with ba cteria and germ s. Apparently they stoppe d a fter 1969 . [H: No, they did NOT stop.]"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"134 The Americans were no t only bombarded with germs, but also with something much more effective. As the NBC announ ced on July 16, 1981 , the Northwest of the U.S. had for several years been subjected to low frequen cy wave a ttacks by the Soviet Union. These radio waves were set to the biological electric frequen cies. They are known a s ELF (extremely low frequen cy) waves and had been d iscovered at the beginning of this century by NIKOLA TES LA. (Books are a vailable). In 1884 , Tesla came to work with Edison, but they soon pa rted ways because of differing views abou t the produ ction o f electric ene rgy and Tesla de cided to work of Edison’s c ompetitor Westinghou se. In 1892 , the first power station for alternating current, designed by Tesla and constructed by Westinghouse, was put in ope ration in Niagara Falls. A short time later, Tesla catapu lted into a “scientific super- space” where, as far as we know toda y, no scientist alive then was able to follow. O nly the ban ker J.P. MORGAN (J.P. Morgan and Co. was the representative of N.M. Rothschild and Co. in the U.S.) who had finan ced Westinghou se seems to have unde rstood what was afoot. Tesla ha d started to tap into the en ergy field that surround s the Earth and fills s pace, then called e ther, and draw out ene rgy – for free, of course. At the same time h e used the ene rgetic field of the ether for several forms of communication and energy transport. Energy sources like coal, oil and water would be come obsolete, as would e lectrical high tension po wer lines. Ships, and a utomobiles, aircraft f actories and hou ses could draw their ene rgy directly from the ene rgy field of the ether. By the end of 189 8, at his Colorado Springs experimental area finan ced b y J .P. Morgan, Tesla came very close to the technical solution of collecting ene rgy from the ether. Toda y this techno logy is known a s the conversion of “gravitationa l ene rgy” or of “tachyon ene rgy”. Morgan und erstood very clearly what this development meant. The control of electricity, oil, petrol, coal, etc., would no longer have been a ssured. Therefore he ordered work to cease and Tesla’s Colorado Springs center to be de stroyed. But Tesla d id not give u p. Until his death o n Janua ry 7, 1943 , he brought forth a staggering number of inventions, some revolutiona ry and some whose implications c an e ven toda y only be guessed. His inventions c ould in a short time turn the Earth into a p aradise, but – as you no w know – this is not what our manipulator’s want. Among those de velopments were machines that can gather energy from the ether (toda y the tachyon field) and transform it into useab le en ergy and a “solid state converter” ( 1931) which d rove a special electrical motor that was installed in a hea vy luxury limousine and gave the latter a p erform ance similar to the petrol engine. The car was test-driven for a week at 130 km/hr – fuel cost ZERO! (This app liance the size of a wine bo x produ ced enou gh ene rgy to run a whole hou seho ld!) He further succeede d in starting artificial earthquakes by a vibration indu ced in the tachyon field that then was transferred to a ll matter. He on ce subjugated a whole b lock in New York to such a quake. Apart from having a pa tent for the remote control of vehicles (189 8) he also ha d developed ene rgy transmission withou t cables. [H: An interesting thing flows from such a de vice a s mentioned abo ve and on e which is contained in a device no larger that a fist, a coun ter to e arthquakes. If you interrupt (coun ter) the frequen cy build-up in the Earth building to a quake, you can stop the major damage a s an outcome.] But what concerns us in this book is his discovery of stand ing waves (which we will look into a b it later) and of extremely low frequen cies known a s the “Tesla-effect”. These experiments formed the basis of all mode rn research in the area o f ELF comm unication. If the tachyon field is s ubjected to a n ELF wave and is then aimed at a h uman being, electrical functions in the brain are d isrupted which causes s evere disturbances in the waking consciousness.

Psychic problems, neu roses and hypertension can be thus treated, but states of aggression or depression may also b e caused.

When the U.S. embassy was c hecked for “bugs” in 196 2, a microwave bea m aimed d irectly at the embassy was detected.

In 1969 Hurwitz had constructed a Tesla weapon that in a radius of 300 meters drastically raised o r lowered the g ravitationa l acceleration of ferrous metals. So Hurwitz could, for instance, make a tiny pistol weigh many kilograms and change the d imensions s o that the ammunition would no longer fit.

There is also an interview with Thomas E. Bearden ). WEA THER WARFARE is ano ther subject most peop le don ’t know abou t. Before we look at it though, let us dea l with the weather in general. We assume that the main problem causing toda y’s weather ano malies is the fact that the Earth g radua lly cools while the doub ling up to now of the CO2 content of the atmosphe re causes a warm ing up (greenhou se effect). An article in the Neue Solidaritat ( New Solidarity ) of February 24, 1993 ad ds: “Recently one could read in the well-known maga zine Nature that there is a vast discrepan cy between the ‘climatic breakdown’ predicted b y the most expen sive mainframe computers and reality. In the Janua ry 28 issue we pub lished a n article b y J ona than D. Kahl titled ‘The Absence o f Any Signs of Greenhou se Warm ing over the Arctic Ocean over the Last Forty Years’.” The beginning of the article shows alread y what this is all abo ut: It states that the general circulation mode l of the atmosphere predicted an increased greenhou se warm ing in higher latitude s. They pub lished temperature measurements in the lower troposphe re over the Arctic Ocean made between 195 0 and 199 0. They had ana lyzed more that 27,000 temperature profiles. Most trend s were statistically not significant. In particular they had n ot noticed an y large-scale warm ing of the surface as predicted in the (climatic) m ode ls; indeed they discovered a marked cooling for the seasons of autumn and winter over the western Arctic Ocean. This discrepan cy suggests that toda y’s c limatic mode ls do not correctly represent the ph ysical processes that influen ce the polar regions. Moira Timm s writes in The Six O’Clock Bus (Turnstone Books, London 197 9) that observatories at the po lar circle report that during the last thirty y ears the temperature had fallen b y abou t 6 degrees C. The Neue Solidaritat goes on: “It would b e hasty now to conclude that the greenhou se mode ls were proved wrong, and this for a very s imple reason: The greenhou se mode ls canno t be disproved by any measurements or any other scientific facts. They are irrefutable be cause they have n othing to d o with scientific statements. Cli matic mode ls are sociological manipulative instruments that allow to construct from a sufficient number of external parameters and a rbitrary observation data disaster scena rios with a maximum political ‘potential for being pu t through ’. Therefore we predict that the very data from Kahl’s s tudy – which toda y appa rently c ontradict the climatic mode ls – will i n just a few weeks belong among the best confirm ations for the greenhou se theo ry. The flexibility of those mode ls s hou ld not be unde restimated.” A subject that never appe ars in the media is that of a po ssible ne w ice a ge. After studying rock and soil samples over decades many reputable meteorologists and geologists have come to the conclusion that during the ne xt fifty y ears an ice a ge should e stablish itself. According to their views an ice a ge is independe nt of the g reenhou se e ffect caused by the pollution of the atmosphe re. In only a few decade s the cooling would e qual the warm ing presently occurring. It is even more worrisome when we consider that only 1% less sunlight could cause the ne xt ice a ge. The redu ction o f irradiation through environmental pollution is less disturbing than the fact that a gigantic v olcanic eruption could diminish sunlight considerably. Cloud s of fine ashes from such an eruption can stay in the stratosphere for years and lower the temperatures on the surface by several degrees. Very little o f this ever appea rs in the media. You should no t believe e verything appea ring in the media abo ut environmental pollution. It is advisable to a lso lend an e ar to the other side."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"137 But there is a completely different side to the subject of weather abo ut which the media a lso keep silent: That toda y’s weather situations cann ot always be d ismissed a s “capriciousness” and that natural disasters, earthquakes, storms and drought periods are everything else than “pun ishment of G od” is s hown b y the following q uote from Moira Timms’ The Six O’Cl ock Bus: “Without a complete theo ry abo ut why the climate is c hang ing, all attempts of man to a lter it are certainly dang erous (similar to a therapy with drugs that fight the symptoms withou t attacking the cause). Is this what Johan n Friede was alluding to? ‘Not everything will be the result of natural causes, rather humanity will reach for the cloud s and thus endang er its v ery existence’. I n 197 5 in the U.S. alone n ine programs for weather modification b y the government and sixty-six programs by other agen cies were condu cted. These programs contain a p lethora of climatological experiments like the seeding o f cloud s with particles for conden sation to produ ce rain, to supp ress hail, to disperse fog, to influen ce h urricane s, to divert blizzards or snowfall, the produ ction of earthqua kes and tidal waves, supp ression of lightning, etc. If toda y’s trend of unpredictable an d cold weather persists, North America, Canada , Northern Europe and Russia will suffer m ost. Weather theft aided by c omplex techno logical mean s where weather is diverted from poo r countries c ould be a very real problem in the nea r future when ‘natural’ disasters, famine an d droug ht hit the less developed na tions. This could e ven lead to war. As all attempts to h arness natural forces this will also lead to manifold repercussions. So far no internationa l laws have bee n passed that limit the ‘weather m onopo ly’ which in itself seems to be very lucrative. To create ‘weather’ in one p lace is only possible b y affecting its potential in an other place. “In 1973 Hondu ras accused the U.S. of stealing its rain and causing a severe droug ht when the U.S. diverted the hurricane ‘Fifi’ to safegua rd the Florida tourist indu stry. This hurricane caused the severest damage in the history of Hond uras. El Salvado r that suffered severe drough ts had leveled a similar complaint aga inst the U.S., like Japan which thinks the seed ing o f typhoon s off Guam deprived it of the scarce but vital rain. Rhode sia an d Israel had bo th been a ccused of rain theft by their neighbo ring states. The UN worked o n a ba n of environmental w ar, but that is a complex and d ifficult matter and it is well nigh impossible to seal that tight. In The Cooling , Lowell Ponte cites military men who admitted that aircraft of the U.S. government had ende d droug hts on the Philippines and the Azores to safegu ard U.S. military interests, but that they had declined to answer pleas by several nations in the African Sahe l zone suffering from drough t and hung er on the ground s that American private compan ies c ould be app roached . Ponte a lso describes Soviet plans to chang e the n orm al weather structures within the USS R drastically to increase agricultural produ ction.” There is also proof that the massive de struction caused b y El Ni no in the Pacific Ocean during 1982 /83 was deliberately caused b y the Soviets by an interference in the iono sphe re. The pheno meno n known a s El Ni no is an ocean current that disrupts weather by natural chan ges occurring abo ut every ten years. Usually this c auses hea vy rainfall over parts of Peru and a limited area oppo site the South American west coast. But the 1982 /83 Nino effects were drastically different: The trade winds over the e quator which in the southern hemisphe re normally blow from east to west someho w w ere subjected to a barrier effect and thus c aused the water currents that normally flow towards Asia to flow back and to bu ild up before the west coast of South America. For reasons unknown to the meteorologists, the trade winds then reversed direction and thereby cause cloudbu rsts in Peru and drought in Australia. Further this c aused earthquakes, mud a valanches and tornadoe s in Southern California, over the west coast of North America an d in Alaska.

These in turn serve as a weather blocking mechan ism produ cing a sudden an d"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"138 une xpected ba rrier effect in the east-west trade winds. Dr. Michrowski of the Canad ian State Department wrote a lread y in 1978 that in the winter of 197 6/77 the Soviets s ucceeded in de termining the resonance of the e arth and thus were ab le to produce relatively stable stand ing waves fixed to a location with which the flow of the jet streams in the northern hemisphe re could be checked or moved. Not only do the purposeful changes to the weather by ELF waves have a de trimental effect on na tural weather structures and the rhythm of the tides, they also ha ve a pathogenic effect on hu mans and a n egative influen ce on an imals who depend on warm wind and o cean currents of are gu ided b y them, by disturbing their natural rhythms and thus s entencing them to dea th.

(Very v aluab le inform ation abo ut changing the weather and abou t psychological warfare can be found in the bo ok Nikola Tesla – Freie Energie statt blut und Ol! , VAP -Verlag Wiesbade n, G ermany, 1991 ). The read er is here reminded of the fact that in the case o f an ice a ge or the worsening of the effect of environmental pollution there are only a few or even no a lternatives and solutions available. For the elite though who since 195 7 know abou t our disastrous environmental cond itions the case is quite different. At that time prominen t scientists met at Huntsville, Alaba ma to monitor data and inform ation from the ne wly installed satellite p rogram. One o f the persons present, Dr. Carl Gerstein, predicted that the po llution in the upp er atmosphe re and the hund red billion tons of CO2 that had settled there would ha ve d isastrous effects by the en d o f the millenn ium. They reached the op inion that during the coming century human life would no longer be possible on the Earth’s s urface du e to the e ffects of this pollution. Therefore they developed a p lan that toda y most UFO-logists are familiar with and whose pub lication had cost the lives of several persons alread y. The plan was as follows: ALTERN ATIVE 1: Detonation of a nuclear device in the stratosphere to enab le the CO2 to escape into space. ALTERN ATIVE 2: Building vast subterranean self-sufficient cities where the “elite of society” would be sent and where they could live un til li fe on the surface would a gain b e possible. ALTERN ATIVE 3: Colonialization o f another plane t, e.g. Mars. Alternative 1 was later declared too dangerous and removed from the program. The other two a lternatives however, were stead ily put in a ction. ALTERN ATIVE 2 comprises – a ccording to my research – a lread y seventy-five subterranean cities, sixty-five of them on the North American continent, one in the Swiss Alps, one in the Transvall, South Africa, and one in Pine Gap, Australia. (The others I canno t remember because I was only allowed to look at a relating list for a short moment.) Among the American unde rground cities are the subterranean ba ses Dulce Base, New Mexico, Area 51, G room Lake, Nevada , the “Coun try Club” in Maryland and Lo s Alamos, called “Dreamland” in California in which gene tic experiments of humans (cloning), test flights and copies of crashed saucers are made as well as developments like pu lsar drives are tested. In April 199 2 I interviewed a lady in Sydney, Australia who doe s not want to b e named. She had worked for an Australian “clean ing brigade” and on their beha lf had also e ntered the unde rgroun d air base PINE GAP . She said, despite the threat of severe pena lties – that Pine Gap was abou t thirteen kilometers deep , functions on the basis of free en ergy, had lakes, suspension railways, its own fruit and vegetable garden s, etc. According to official inform ation Pine Gap can withstand a direct nuclear hit withou t problems. (More abou t Pine Gap in Stan Deyo’s Cosmic Conspiracy )."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"139 ALTERN ATIVE 3 appa rently was begun in 195 9. In the late Fifties alread y American saucers had bee n built with the aid of G erman scientists who had he lped bu ild the German saucers – Viktor Schaub erger (VRIL 7) among others - and b y using the techno logy of UFOs crashed in the Western U.S. A secret program parallel to the official space program was s tarted where the moon ’s surface was explored u sing saucer technology. Beginning in 1960 two moon bases run conjointly by Americans and Russians were erected on the eastern edge of the MARE IMBRIUM. Those were the ARCH IMEDES BASE and the CASS INI BASE , named after the craters in which they were set up. The moon ba ses were planned a s stop-off places on the flight to Mars. On May 22, 1962 the first manned land ing on Mars is s aid to ha ve happene d. This land ing as well as the flight across the Mars s urface with comm entaries by the American and Russian crew w as recorded from the saucer. In Janu ary 1977 this film was given to Sir William Ballantine, a reno wned radio a stronomer, by Harry Carm ell, a NASA staff member. On February 6, 197 7 Ballantine had p lanned a meeting with John Hend ry, the manager of a daily newspape r, to discuss pub lication of this film. On the way to Hend ry he d ied in a mysterious car acciden t. Aided b y Ballantine’s wife and Carmell, the film finally reached the hand s of the Science Report team of the English Sceptre TV station and was broadcast in the ne xt installment of the Science Report . The station then received the tip that they would lose their license if they would continue to repo rt on this s ubject. The film shot from the cockpit of the flying craft shows a brief view of the instrument pane l w here the outside air pressure registers with 700 millibars and the outside temperature with 4 deg rees C. The astrona uts, whose voices had a lso bee n recorded , cheered an d shouted: “It is the 22 nd of March, 1962 , we a re on Mars – and we ha ve a ir!” Remarks: If I have so far held ba ck with my persona l hypotheses, I would ne vertheless like to state one he re. I hea r the read er say: “What a lot of non sense, we know that life on Mars is impossible.” My question to you then : Do you a ctually KNOW? Let’s be hone st: the only thing we know abou t Mars is what has appea red in NASA repo rts or what is pub lished in the comm on textboo ks. The pub lic has been TOLD that there is no life on Mars, but that doe s not mean that we KNOW! You have to realize that the space programs are again monopo lies, and n o one e xcept the scientists directly involved in the projects REA LLY know anything. Whatever inform ation they choo se to release we ha ve to take for granted, since at this moment we canno t fly up to Mars to persona lly check it out. Let us assume that Mars is really dead ; then it’s just back to square one ; we would realize that we ha ve to stay on Earth and that no adventure is waiting for us there. But if we a ssume that life on Mars would be po ssible in one form or ano ther – perhaps und er galls domes with filtered a ir – do you think that this would be d ivulged just like that? The Viking I pictures of July 31, 197 6 shot from an altitude of 1.278 miles over the n orthern h emisphe re show the no w w ell-known Mars face (1.5 Km long) and to the left of it the symm etrical forms of several pyramids. The very existence of these bu ildings is revolutiona ry enou gh to shake all the so-called world religions to their founda tions by hinting that the e arthboun d human race is perhap s not alone after all and definitely not the “crown of Creation”. The existence of the pyramids allows two hypotheses that destroy all previous accoun ts abou t the h istory of humanity. The builders of the pyramids were e ither out prede cessors, raising the question o f how they got to Mars. If that was the case, they had to ha ve possessed a n advanced technology, a fact that western religions and science den ies. Or the bu ilders of the pyramids were n ot related to humans, which mean s that the pyramids bea r witness to the e xistence of extraterrestrial life-form s, another fact that the aforementioned institutions steadfastly den y.

If, however, they did colonize Earth at one time they probab ly are one of our main races now. (Perhap s the red race, just as the n ame implies?) We have eno ugh d ifferent races whose cosmogony maintains just such a n event in the p ast. The movement of the cana ls of Mars, hitherto inexplicable to the astronomers, supp orts the theo ry that Mars c ann ot be completely dead . If Mars was really dead a s many so-called scientists claim, and if no o ther life e xists in the universe, if we hu mans can roam freely – a t least in o ur own solar system – the question arises of what happene d with the Soviet probe Phobo s II that landed in 198 9 on Phobo s. For before Phobo s II could set a land ing vehicle down o f the small Mars moon Phobo s, radio contact permane ntly ceased for unknown reasons. Another enigma is the d isappe arance of the U.S. Mars probe Observer on August 24, 199 3. It had the task of taking new pho tograph s of the Mars face and p yramids. Curious, isn’t it? [H: More curious is that right now currently there a re p ictures of that Mars FACE in full detail being shown and pub lished : May 2001 .] Make your own judgment abo ut the Mars s tory. There is eviden ce abou t the first flight to Mars by the Reich-Germans on boa rd the big Haune bru III (one third of the crew w ere Japane se men an d women) on April 21, 194 5. Further there e xists a logbook of the VRIL-7 abou t its first flight to Mars withou t a land ing. It describes the surface and the Cydon ia region is much more d etail than the pho tos of the Viking in 197 6 showed! A film exists of this flight ( shots inside the saucer and o ut, from the cockpit), but I canno t provide an y lead s to it except that it is s aid to b e in the hand s of the Societas Templi Marcioni. I just canno t believe the Americans and the Russians are not able to bu ild a n anti-gravity drive, too, as the Australians have a lread y done , according to Stan Deyo. ALTERN ATIVE 2, the und ergroun d cities, however is a reality. So, if the second a lternative was c arried ou t, why not also the third? The complete story of Alternative 3 , the alleged state of Mars, its atmosphe re, the supp ression of information, the construction of bases, the measures of protection and camouflage, the hou sing of personne l, transport, the brainwashing of personne l and the difficulties that appa rently arose an d perhaps are still existing are to b e foun d in Le slie Watkins’s book and video Alternative 3 . As you can see, the subject of UFOs had often a much more terrestrial and realistic mean ing than is generally repo rted. It is also ea sier to und erstand how just why huge sums of mone y are spen t to go against researchers who app roach a solution in the construction of flying craft that fly with a kind o f fuel no conglomerate of the world can monopo lize of tax. In the mean time, however, some peop le ha ve p rivately built and flown such flying d isks, a fact the multinationa ls don ’t like at all. Not all scientists are vena l and many have foun d out that inventions like these shou ld n ot be patented b ut put into p rodu ction directly. Yet I am certain these peop le, some o f whom I know persona lly (all Germ ans and Austrians), will never come o ut pub licly with their inventions, rather they will build more of their crafts and give them to the Reichs-Germans. They will try everything they can to prevent that their inventions end in some Illuminati compan ies’ hand s. The time will come soon when the Illuminati will discover that they have no t bee n as powerful as they believed. Then all these and similar inventions will become a vailable a ll over the world to everyone .

In 197 4, for example, the price of crude oil spiraled be cause o f the OPE C oil embargo. Behind the scene s the internationa l bankers had made an agreement with the Arab OPE C leade rs. The principle is very simple. The Arabs made mone y because the prices went up, the car drivers – the bu yers – pa id up an d the oil multinationa ls c ashed in. Oil compan ies like ARC O, SHELL, MOBIL, EXX ON...were a ll li nked to the CH ASE MANH ATT AN BA NK (Rockefeller). The Chase Manha ttan Bank in turn had sealed the a greement with the OPE C leade rs, and the latter’s part of the dea l w as to depo sit the profits made b y selling o il at high prices, just as in 197 4, for thirty y ears at 7% interest with the Chase Manha ttan Bank. With these de posits, huge loan s were granted to the so-called third world n ations like Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. And these coun tries are then b led with the immensely high interest payments. To balance these interest payments, which they canno t with mone y alone , they have to grant the ba nks ever-increasing influen ce over their economy and politics. The leade rs of those countries are forced to follow the line of the internationa l ban kers or they will be replaced. The internationa l bankers profit in several ways from the e mbargo. Firstly from the depo sits by the OPE C coun tries, then from the earnings by the oil compan ies linked to the banks, and then from the influen ce upon them gained from this indeb tedn ess.

CH AP TER 50 THE CIA A ND THE S HAH In 197 9, the h ated Shah who got his power in 1953 a ided b y the CIA was c hased from Iran by the revolution. Since a s a rule most employees at a U.S. embassy are also CIA members, the Iranian rebe ls, who knew abou t that fact, in revenge took the U.S. (CIA) employees hostage. The CIA in turn retaliated b y telling the leade r of Iraq, SA DD AM HU SSE IN, that this was a good time to invade Iran since the latter at this time was weakened (which was not necessarily true). The invasion b y Hussein was s uccessful and the Iranian ho stage-takers let Jimmy Carter know that they would free the ho stages in e xchan ge for arm s. Since most of their arm s bou ght during the Shah ’s time were from the U.S., they had to get ammunition an d spares from the States, too. Presiden t CARTER however, refused this dea l and at the same time started a secret mission with the CIA (Desert O ne) to free the ho stages. But the CIA did no t exactly like Carter since he ha d instigated drastic c uts for the CIA. So an ea rly opinion po ll was laun ched to a scertain which cand idate was more likely to win the next presiden tial elections – Carter or Reagan. The peop le voted for Carter. The CIA however, wanted Reagan and so they planned to sabo tage the rescue mission DESE RT ONE so Presiden t Carter would lose face. At the same time WILLIAM CASEY , form er CIA director and hea d o f Reagan’s election comm ittee had e stablished contact with Iran’s revolutiona ry leade r AY ATOLLAY K homeini.

William Casey had a good reputation be cause h e was instrumental in the building of the largest lorry manufacturer in the world, the Kama River Lorry Co. in the Soviet Union. Since Casey was also chairm an o f the Export Import Bank, Khomeini decided to collabo rate with h im. In the third week of O ctober 198 0, GEORGE BUSH (Skull & B one s member and later U.S. Presiden t) and RICH ARD ALLEN as Casey’s representative met with the age nts of the Iranian Hizbollah e xtremists at the Hotel R aphae l in Paris. There it was agreed that the U.S. would transport arms to Iran via Israel and that the Iranians would free the ho stages the moment Reagan was declared Presiden t. The first arms delivery was to take place two weeks later (in March 1981 ). [Really?] The CIA’s s abotage of Desert One p lanned b y themselves was s uccessful.

This, of course, gave Sadda m the go-ahea d. O n August 2, 199 0, Iraqi troop s invaded Kuwait.

Des Griffin writes that the d eclaration made by Israeli parliament in July 1980 , namely that Jerusalem was now the po litical capital of Israel, could b e o f utmost importance. Is this a step in the direction towards a much more ambitious goal by the Zionist side? For years it has been a n accepted fact that the Zionists planned to make Jerusalem the administrative center of the one world government. This goal had been stated in 196 2 by Israel’s Prime Minister DAV ID BE N-GUR ION. Any attempt to establish such a world a lliance with Jerusalem as its center would surely start the Third World War that the top Illuminati Albert Pike ha d foretold in h is letter to Mazzini. Pike said that this Third World War would start in the Near East, due to the enmity between the Arabs and the Israelis and that it would end in the found ing of a world d ictatorship. The attitude of the internationa l bankers towards the erection of such a globa l slave camp becomes eviden t in the words of JAMES WARBUR G spoken b efore the Senate o n February 17, 195 0: “We will have a World Government, whether we like it or not. The only question is whether this World Government will be reached b y conquest or by consent.” According to William Coope r the Third World War is planned for the middle of 199 6. He got this inform ation from secret pap ers he had seen d uring h is time as a Naval Intelligence officer. Thus it is planned to destroy one o f the three largest American cities (New York, San Francisco or Los Ange les) with an atom bomb.

A world a rmy was planned b y the UN , after all. The collapse of oil prices in 1986 ha d hit the Soviet planned e conomy v ery hard. Form the Seventies onwards oil export had bee n an important foreign exchan ge source for the Kremlin. The e arnings were just then going down when Gorbachev with h is reform s promised more than h e could keep. The resulting econo mic chao s was one of the reasons why Moscow relinquished liaisons to the Eastern Europea n satellite states. Many Soviets coun ted o n a reun ited Germ any as the idea l partner for the building of the Russian econo my. In November 1989 was when the Soviet rug was pulled from unde r the feet of East Germany. Unde r pressure b y the refugees leaving via Hungary and the freed om m ovement on East Germ any’s streets the o ld GDR w as dissolved within weeks. While ou twardly the dramatic end o f Communist tyrann y was c elebrated, the Illuminati had serious doubts abou t the success of a peop le’s revolution in Eastern Europe. They were further alarmed b y the prospect of an alternative to the U.S. econo mic policy developing in Germany. Therefore the Anglo-American media was quickly given the key word FOURTH R EICH . The political strategists in Londo n and Washington saw long -term repercussions of G erman unity and a renewed, strong and eventually independen t G ermany only too clearly. They also realized the da nger that the Project Germany might be successful – against the Illuminati’s will – in raising an d pulling along other countries because of the power and faith of 85 million peop le. In the summer of 1990 , the Thatcher government – according to London sources – b ad the British Secret Service considerably strengthen its activities in Germ any and to this end established a ne w Secret Service depa rtment. The Bush a dministration, too, took steps to strengthen its influen ce on German policy. An independe nt and positive de velopment is not part of the plans of the Illuminati. Thus, on November 30, 1989 , Alfred Herrhau sen, chairman of the Deutsche Bank and member of the Bilderberger group, was assassinated b y professiona l killers (not the Red Brigade, the RAF – Rote Armee Fraktion!) Herrhau sen was an important advisor to Kohl. A few days earlier, in a n interview w ith the Wall Street Journal, he ha d talked abou t his plans for the rebu ilding of East G ermany. In one de cade it shou ld be come Europe ’s most progressive indu strial nation. He a lso talked abou t a fund ing program for Third World nations. Appa rently, Herrhau sen ha d positioned h imself against the system of the Establishment, which he ha d clearly stated a t the BILDERBE RG conference o f 1988 an d at a meeting of the “American Chamber of Commerce”, also in 198 8. Later the head of the Treuhand , Detlev Rohwedde r, was also shot dead . An assassination a ttempt on Wolfgang Schaub le failed to kill him. All attacks were linked to the rebu ilding p rogram in East Germany. That the pha ntom of the Red Brigade had to take the blame in the killing of Herrhau sen is close to a ba d joke. Herrhau sen was one of the most vulnerable pe rsona lities in Germ any and special security arrangements had bee n made. The security dep artment of the Deutsche Bank guarded his person, the po lice was respon sible for patrolling the area where he lived and u sed for the ob servation of the residen tial area specially trained an d e quipped units of the Hessian mobile task force (MEK ). Despite this the assassins managed to d ig a hole in the street in Bad Homburg, to lay a cable and resurface the road withou t anybod y"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"149 noticing. Chief Federal Prosecutor VON STAHL told the members of the Bund estag that the attack had been p lanned a week earlier and that the assassins had a lread y installed a lmost all parts of the later bomb trap, including the cable subsequen tly iden tified a s the lead to the fuse mechan ism. On the da y of the attack the a ssassins installed a ph otoelectric barrier and positione d the bomb moun ted on a b icycle so that Herrhau sen’s c ar had to pass immediately by it. All these prepa rations happene d at a location that had bee n patrolled b y the po lice just half an hou r before withou t them noticing an ything un toward. This is remarkable, because a janitor of the swimm ing ba ths nearby had seen – abo ut half an hou r before the attack – some young men who a cted conspicuou sly. In add ition the trap would on ly work if Herrhau sen’s c ar would pa ss first through the photoelectric barrier, not preceded b y another car. The form er presiden t of the Bunde verfassungsschutz (the Germ an secret service), DR . RICH ARD MEIER, told the Bund estag (the German parliament) one week after the attack, that the car normally lead ing Herrhau sen’s three-car convoy had been called off. ( Had somebod y from the RAF telephoned and said that the first car was hinde ring the assassination? ) Another peculiarity thought out by the assassins which po ints to a lot of experience in hand ling military explosives in the fact that the bo mb was fashioned a s a hollow charge . This had the e ffect of the shock wave be ing directiona l instead o f uniform ly extend ing a ll around . The building of this bomb as well as the knowledge of the weak points of the arm ored Mercede s c ar with the open ing side windows abou t which on ly a small circle of security specialists who had seen the p ertinen t test results knew: all this c ann ot by any stretch of the imagination b e blamed on the RAF terrorists or any other beginne rs. The security service could no t find any useful lead s at the site o f the attack what would enab le them to po int to any group o f perpetrators. A piece o f pape r with a five-pointed star, a p icture o f a Heckler & Koch submachine gun with RAF stenciled on an d the words “Kommando Wolfgang Beer” had bee n left beh ind which, however, did no t lead an ywhere. As with a ll the o ther attacks appa rently made b y an RAF since the arrest of the so-called second RAF generation around Christian Klar and the no w w ell-known d isappea ring of part of the terrorists in the former GDR since 198 4, there was and is not a single proof of an actually existing leftist terrorist group that can legitimately be called RAF. There are n o fingerprints, no saliva on cigarette stubs, no hair nor any other useful lead s to the p erpetrators who for nine years now have been bo mbing, shooting and recently expertly blew up a prison. The letter claiming respon sibility in the Herrhau sen case was s o flimsy that the form er Federal Minister of the Interior SCH AUBLE criticized that the contents of the letter were curiously at odd s with the severity and technical perfection o f the assassination. There is a desperate lack of proofs or even h ints and clues of a terrorist organization RAF, still the security service o f G ermany is holding on to the theory of an RAF committing these crimes. On July 1, 1992 the authors of a German TV report in Brennpun k t (focus) titled The End of the RAF Legen d showed the results of their research. They postulated that the so-called third generation RAF that was officially blamed for these attacks existed on ly as a legend that was no longer tenab le. The Brennpun kt authors Wolfgang Lan dgraebe r, Ekkeha rd Sieker and Gerhard Wisnewski elabo rated o n their thesis in their book abou t the RAF Phan tom (Knau r Verlag). Their main arguments: Contrary to the first (Meinho f, Baad er, Enslin) and the second (Susann e Albrecht, Christian Klar) RAF generations the so-called third gene ration leaves “not even a h int of a clue” at the scene of the crime. The persons counted among the third gene ration (e.g. Christian Seidler) all disappe ared withou t a trace in the mid-Eighties withou t any sign o f life e ver emerging since."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"150 The cells being comm ande d by terrorists in p rison is dou bted if not outright excluded b y specialists. The command level had to be elsewhere. The only clues from which the pe rpetration b y the RAF had been ded uced were the letters claiming respon sibility that were dee med authentic by the Fede ral Secret Service. The method s used to reach this v erdict are n ot above doub t, however. The main po int in the program was an interview w ith the principal witness of the Herrhau sen case, Siegried Nonne who no w retracted h is statement of Janu ary 1992 . He said that he had been forced by members of the Hessian o ffice respon sible for defend ing the constitution threatening h im with imprisonment and murder to make the false statement of having harbored the perpetrators in h is apartment in Bad Homburg and to have he lped them prepa re the assassination of Alfred Herrhau sen. The TV team reached the conclusions that the third generation RAF were a pha ntom artificially kept alive to mislead the popu lation. Further there was the suspicion that the political powers of the Fede ral R epub lic of G erm an had not only tolerated but fostered outright the disappea rances of a large section of RAF members in the form er GDR i n the late Seventies and e arly Eighties. It is probab le that not only the secret services of the Allies but also the German authorities had known that these former RAF members had gone unde rground in the GDR . The pub lic however was led to be lieve that these peop le still shown on “Wanted” posters had something to do with the attacks in the Eighties. In the most recent attack that the so-called RAF claimed ha ving perpetrated was the e xpert detona tion o f the prison building at Weiterstadt, everything was as usual: just a pape r with the RAF emblem and the command o name, otherwise no clues, no mistakes, no witnesses. The Italian journalist Cipriani had interviewed the former American Air Force colone l Fletcher Prouty who finds the key to Herrhau sen’s assassination in the first eleven p ages of a speech Herrhau sen was going to de liver in the U.S. four days after his murder. It contained Herrhua sen’s vision of a ne w evaluation of the situation b etween Eastern and Western Europe which would h ave chan ged the destiny of the world. Colone l Prouty said in the interview further that Alfred Herrhau sen, John F. Kenned y, Aldo Moro, Enrico Mattei and Olof Palme ha d all been murdered for the same reason – because they did no t accept the world be ing controlled b y the condo minum of Jalta. In e very case it had been the deed of a small elite [group] that saw their power founded upo n the idea of a “pax mond iale” (world pea ce) threatened . Remarks on Toda y’s Situation: The purposefully staged wave o f asylum- seekers arriving in Germ any forms part of the elite’s plan for a New World Order. It is used to build up ho stility to foreigners, xenophob ia, in Germany. Thus the right-wing political parties would get more adhe rents and acts of violence b y right-wingers towards asylum- seekers and the hand icapped would increase to justify the propaganda slogan “Fourth Reich” disseminated by the Anglo-American Establishment. Since the reun ification o f the two Germ an nations and the demise o f the order of Versailles and Jalta, the po litical class of G erm any refused to open ly stand up against the geopo litically motivated p ropagand a o f a Rise o f a Fourth Reich. Quite o n the contrary: Some forces, e.g. the chairman o f the Europea n Trilateral C ommission, O TTO GRAF LAMBS DORFF , follow political-econo mically the same a ggressive course with the same effect as the o bjectives of the geopo liticians – no infringement on the failed po litics by the IMF, the ho lding at bat of G erm an initiatives. The outbursts of Mr. Peter Glotz, one of the SP D l eade rs, against the cond emnation o f the Serbian aggression in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung bea r witness to the geopo litical views within Germ any. The geopo litically aligned na tions (England, France an d the U.S.) would like a second Near East, an o pen wound in the southern flank of Europe (war in"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"151 Yugoslavia), to stop a n eventual Eurasian reform which would be centered on closer collabo ration with Russia, France an d Germany. If one coun try can influen ce the events in Eastern Europe, then that country is Germany. Unde r these po litical guidelines all efforts c ontravening this plan, e.g. the German e cono mic development endea vors towards the East, have to b e thwarted at all cost. The vulnerability and weakness of Chancellor Kohl and h is government could not have been better demonstrated b efore the world than b y the fact that in the same month the wall came down, Dr. Alfred Herrhau sen, speaker of the boa rd o f the Deutsche Bank fell victim to a terrorist attack whose instigators and executors remain u nknown un til today and can walk free withou t fear of persecution. Strategically far-sighted, Alfred Herrhau sen had propo sed for quite some time a remission of deb t for developing coun tries, especially in the year of the crash o f 1987 . But in the eyes of his ene mies his propo sals were ab solutely unbea rable, since be sides the remission h e now also a sked for an econo mic development plan for Eastern Europe . Herrhau sen spoke o f a Polish de velopment ban k mode led after the Credit Bank for Reconstruction. Here Herrhau sen contravened – n ot just in the e yes of Colone l Prouty – the un written laws by the Londone r and New Yorker m onetary power group s and so got caught in the terrorist net of his ene mies. At the significant moment of the collapse of the Communist system in the East, Chan cellor Kohl failed to instigate a g loba l change o f direction towards a real rebu ilding plan for the East.

According to Der Spiege l , Chan cellor Kohl said after the murder of Herrhau sen that he had lost a strategically thinking close ad visor and that now petty minds dominated in most of G ermany. Following this terrible deed Kohl and his government did not dare to expose the reasons for the crime to the pub lic and to motivate po lice and investigators in such a way that the murderers and the men beh ind would be caught, their m otives established and their deed atoned . Instead, the pub lic was told something abo ut a “third RAF gene ration”, supp orted in part with false testimony. Four years after the assassination o f Herrhausen the void he left is v ery appa rent.

The murders of Herrhau sen and Rohwedde r have given those po litical trend s in Germany a boo st which stand for an economic “going for broke” policy patterned after the worst free trade doctrine.

The outbreaks of violence, especially aimed a t foreigners, but also against the hand icappe d and the homeless, that in 199 2 had caused the de aths of seventeen peop le, seven of which were foreigners, are seen by the press that had talked abo ut the threat of Fourth Reich before as c onfirmation for their thesis of a flare-up of neo -Nazism.

The distorted p icture that was propagand istically disseminated at home and abroad shows the geopo litical intention (the weakening of rebu ilding impulses towards the East) as well as pure h ypocrisy. With the a id of official documents and topical interviews with lead ing American ne o-Nazis and KKK members it is possible to trace ba ck how for many y ears, in fact since the Seventies, G erm any had been a very busy playground for these racists and skinhead s from America.

The VV N (Vereinigung de r Verfolgten d es naziregimes – Association of those Persecuted by the Nazi R egime) that ad bee n directly finan ced by the Stasi and the old GDR now w orks directly with the BdA (Bund d ero Antifaschisten – Alliance of Anti-Fascists) and set themselves up a s spearhead ing the anti-fascist fight. As you can see, the Illuminati here again ha ve financed b oth sides, in the best Machiavellian manne r, and so control them both. On the on e side the chain lead s from the Scottish Rite of Masonry (Mossad, KKK , B’nai B’rith, Anti-Defamation Le ague (ADL), NSDAP /AO) to the German ne o-Nazi and skinhead scene an d on the other side the Stasi network c ontrolled b y the Comm unist system that extend s into Antifa and left extremist scene s.

A large p ortion o f the propaganda material of the FAP (Freie Deutsch Arbeiterpartei – Free German Worker’s Party) recently banned , came from the NSDAP /AO. There are more interesting links to be un covered. The leade r of the English skin rock band SCR EWDR IVE R, Ian Stuart, for instance, works with the BRITISH N ATIONAL FRONT. Until 1985 they belonged to the WHITE NOISE CLUB of the British Nationa l Front in which racist English skinhead band s groupe d themselves. In 1985 Ian Stuart founde d the BLOOD & HONOUR movement through which they disseminated the “White Power” idea o f the Ku Klux Klan. But not only skin rock banks formed part of that group o f specialists.

The developments around the campaign o f conquest the Serbs started in 1991 would no t have been po ssible withou t the backing of Moscow and b y the Bush administration. The U.S. dep uty secretary of state at the time, LAWRENC E EA GLEB UR GER, a p rominen t partner in the consulting firm KISS INGER ASS OCIATES , together with ano ther Kiss Ass partner, LORD C ARR INGTON, saw to it that Belgrade got a free hand for ethnic c lean sing and geno cide. At the same time mechan isms for massive illegal mone y transfers to Belgrade were set up to finan ce this c ampaign an d to pay for the import of arm s, oil and other good s. In the last two years private ba nks in Belgrade surprised with interest offers of 15% per month for foreign currency and of 200% for Dinar depo sits, in view of a yearly inflation of"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"154 2,000 %. Considering the massive une mployment and the large number of peop le withou t income, this interest offer looked like a po litical trick to coun teract the g rowing discontent in the popu lace abou t the economic hardships the war brought them. An observer said: “ Somebod y is finan cing a covert welfare system.” Some a spects of these practices came to light when in March 1993 the Belgrade ba nker Jesdomir Vasiljevic, the head of the JUGOSKA ND IC BA NK, cleared off t o Israel. The press disclosed that this bank had a lmost 4 million a ccoun ts with depo sits of almost 2 b illion US$. Where did these sums c ome from? [H: DO WE REA LLY NEE D TO ASK ?] Before the war Yugoslavia had had a flourishing tourist trade and a n a rm aments indu stry manufacturing mainly light arms for export, but after the repa yment of 14 billion US$ in foreign deb t there was not much left over. Tourism has since founde red and the arms produ ction is used in the war. The Serbian government also p rofits from the spoils from the conquered areas, but this, too, is little compared to the actual need . Russian o il, and arms are delivered on ly against cash. Western o il, e.g. from the MOBIL OIL refinery at Thessaloniki in Greece enters the country at black market prices that can b e 400 % abo ve the market value. With its role in the drug trade via the Balkan route, Belgrade had got access to the o ff-shore mone y launde ring system, and this is where the source o f the fund s is to be found . The growing activities by the SE RBIAN MAFIA steered from Belgrade in Western Europe is surely ano ther one . In Belgrade there is a schoo l for burglary which ob viously is protected by the secret services and whose g radua tes are posted a ll over Europe where they hand the stolen good s to a well-organized ne twork of receivers. Yet it is difficult to imagine that this mone y source shou ld suffice to meet the Serbian war bill, even considering the g rowing importance of the Serbian Mafia o n the Western Europea n drug market. Clueless c omm entators had repea tedly compared the practices by the JUGO SKA ND IC and its most important competitor, the DAFIMENT BA NK, to the usual investment swindlers who promise regular high interest payments on real estate and other investments to pull the mone y out of the peop le’s pocket. But reality is different. It is not small Serbia that is getting the fund s out of the big shots on the internationa l hot mone y markets. The same po wers that gave the green light for the war also a rranged the finan cing. Serbia is not organizing this flow of fund s; it is its ben eficiary. There are arrangements where local banks in Belgrade or offshore channe ls have bee n used – for a fee – to launde r on a monthly basis part of the cash income from the internationa l drug trade. Belgrade ’s profits were no t bad at all. Standa rd interest for launde ring is between 3 an d 7%, but in view of the eno rmous sums made in the world-wide drug trade dea lers c an pa y up to 30% withou t smarting. Israel Kelman from Tel Aviv holds 25% of the stock of Defina Milano vic’s DAFIMENT BA NK in Belgrade. The fact that Vasiljevic of the JUGOSKA ND IC cleared o ff t o Israel points to his key role in the war finan cing technique inspired by Anglo-American interests. In a similar way, the U.S. banks had saved themselves from bankruptcy by a massive infusion o f drug mone y in the 198 2 Latin-American deb t crisis. This has little to do with a free-m arket economy. According to Germ an police sources it was learned , while investigating the Serbian Mafioso in Germany that, Belgrade did no t offer any internationa l police co-ope ration and therefore is probab ly an ea sier place to launde r mone y than Switzerland . Cyprus, a well-developed o ffshore ba nking center, is the most important ope rating base for the bankers of Belgrade. The obviously successful finan cing of the war that was effected b y financial interests beh ind EA GLEB UR GER and CARR INGTON (Committee of 300) is not due to e xcessive secrecy, but to inactivity by the West. After observing the activities of the Belgrade banks for eighteen months, everyone including the d iplomats there knew that something was amiss. It was known the ba nks were represented o n Cyprus. Nothing was don e, although the UN"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"155 sanctions also included finan cial transfers to Serbia with the exception of fund s for medical and o ther humanitarian pu rposes. Only in April of 1993 it was admitted b y the UN sanctions comm ittee that one had neglected to consult the Cypriot administration abou t the Serbian ban king conne ctions. There had bee n “too little concrete inform ation”. The banker Vasiljevic had spent fifteen to twenty y ears abroad, predominan tly in Australia and was well-known for his dea ling in the “war zone s of the Far East”, as the British Observer put it.

The same Murphy worked in 1944 a s political advisor to the U.S. government for Germ any and in 194 5 as political advisor at the U.S. military government in Germany. In 198 8 the meeting was held in Telfz nea r Innsbruck, Austria, and German Chan cellor Helmut Kohl was attend ing. From June 6 to 9 , 199 0 the Bilderbergers met in Baden -Bade n, G erm any. One of the topics was the Marshall plan that propo sed a 10 0 billion do llar assistance to the CIA and in return demanded that the CIS states adop t the free-market rules. Here it was also de cided for Sadda m to invade Kuwait. The last meeting I know abou t was held on May 20, 1992 , at the Hotel Ermitage in Evian, France. The main topic at this meeting was the Agend a 200 0, the world government planned for the year 200 0. As you can see, this s ubject is v ery topical, even if outwardly it doe s not appe ar to b e so. I would like to interject here that WILLY BRAND T, the deceased Jewish e x-chan cellor, a member of the Bilderbergers and of the Committee o f 300, had written a book called Nord- Sud, ein Uberleben sprogramm ( North-South, a Program for Survival), where he d escribes a world government by the UN (by the year 200 0). And it is also interesting to note that the UN -banne r has the same colors as the bann er of Israel! Remember, the Illuminati speak in symbols! The ANTI-DEFAMATION LEA GUE (ADL) by the B’NAI B’RITH is a non -accredited foreign agency for Israel, who in the last years has leveled may charges against researchers, especially against Spotlight . It collabo rates with the SCOTT ISH RITE OF F REE MAS ONR Y, which could e xplain why they are such strong supp orters of the Albert Pike memorial and so strongly oppo sed to econo mic scientist and repe ated presiden tial cand idate L yndon LaRouche. From January 29, 1989 , LaRouche was a political prisone r in Minne sota after having been sentenced to 15 years imprisonment in a judicial scanda l staged by the American establishment. He was however freed in 199 4. In the e yes of the Illuminati, LaRouche ha d become a very awkward ad versary since he discovered and laid open the e ntanglements between the establishment, the Ku Klux Klan, the ADL, the B’nai B’rith, the Scottish Rite, the CFR, the Trilateral C omm ission...etc. From the large-scale propaganda b y the ADL against LaRouche most know him as a right-wing extremist, although he is the main ad vocate for the removal of Albert Pike’s statue in Washington. Gary Allen writes: “One major reason for the historical blackout on the role of the internationa l bankers in political history is that the Rothschilds were Jewish.

For m any experts Japan is the country that is best prepa red for the globa l changes of the ne xt century brought abo ut by techno logy. The fact that Japane se managers are represented in the TRILATERAL COMMISS ION doe s not mean that Japa n is 100 % infiltrated. The Japan ese e lite itself is v ery strongly interlaced with secret lodges that the Anglo-American multinationa ls s o for have on ly had very limited influen ce on the Japan ese e conomy. This is expressed very clearly in the bo ok The Japan that Can Say NO by SONY boss AK IO MORITA and the lead ing Japane se politician SHINTARO ISHIHARA. The book intende d only for the Japane se has quite a n explosive power. It characterizes America a s the unloved friend, as a racist country and it hints at Japan p lann ing to retaliate for the capitulation cond itions forced upo n it. The authors describe the U.S. from a Japane se viewpoint as a tottering, rotting, dying colossus, mortally wounded unde r its s tar-spangled ban ner serving a s a shroud. According to them Japa n has de facto forced the American economic s ystem to capitulate. Ishihara and Morita open ly state in their book what hitherto Japane se bu sinessmen only dared voice in p rivate circles and on the quiet: “During the Second World War the U.S. air force bombarded civil targets in Germany, but only on Japan which was read y to capitulate atom bombs were d roppe d for testing reasons. This was a terrible case o f racism.” This enforces statements by some lead ing Japane se p ersona lities that destruction of the American econo my was targeted as retaliation for Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was s aid: “ Japan is at war with the U.S. We will conque r America econo mically and retaliate for the loss of face in the Pacific c aused to us by the U.S.! (C.O.D.E.

A large portion of New Zealand real estate, most hotels and big compan ies on the Australian east coast and a large p art of Canad ian forest belong to the Japane se. Just how far the Japane se a re actually controlled and u sed b y the Illuminati the future will show. A further organization that presents an o utward p icture at variance with what it actually goes on is the USA ID. According to Anton Chaitkin and Jessica Primack in A S trategy of Tension USA ID not only serves as a traditiona l cover for spy ope rations by the CIA, but it is also largely respon sible for Anglo-American interventions in a ll parts of the world. There is for instance a USA ID program with a 30 0 million do llar budget for birth control in third world coun tries whose main mission is the sterilization o f colored popu lation.

CH AP TER 56 GEORGE SOROS AND THE ROTHSCH ILD CONN ECTION Who was George Soros? [H: Better yet: Who IS this man? Meet one of the most prominen t of the p layers in your downfall. He very much ‘was’ but he also IS and did, in fact wreck the econo my of Southea st Asia in very short order. He is a top player in such as Bilderbergers and all the other controlling group s while do ing nothing “illegal”. But then n o one can d o anything illegal if you and your colleagues make the laws.] The now sixty-four year old Hungarian with a U.S. passport is a supe rstar amidst the great speculators. When the last Forbes list of the best-paid managers and finan ciers was pub lished , Soros was in the lead by a h uge margin. In the last year he earned 550 million US$, twenty times as much as the Disney boss. When Soros open s the hun t, the internationa l mone y markets get moving and the reserve ba nks s tart worrying. In September 199 3 he succeeded o ver the Bank of England . He was c ertain that the ba nk would ha ve to take the pound that came unde r pressure out of the Europea n exchan ge mechan ism and de value it. He gambled ten billion US$ - with success. He made one b illion US$ which the British taxpayers now have to come up with. He h imself open ly likes to b e knows as the man who wants to influen ce the big mone y markets of the world. This is a very unu sual stance for an investor to take, who shou ld rather be interested in u sing situations unob servedly that the competitors have no t yet discovered. In March 199 3 Soros’ activities became known when he p redicted a rise in the price o f gold. It is assumed – since this started a buying spree in precious metals – that this drove the price u p 20% over the highest price since the Gulf War. In the beginning of June 199 3 he wrote an ope n letter to the bu siness editor of the Londo n Times , Anatole Kaletsky, announ cing that he intende d to urge the mone y markets to sell large amount of G erm an government bon ds in favor of French stocks. Which means: Down with the Germ an mark and attack on the Bunde sbank! In several newspape rs across the world Soros is praised as a kind of Robin Hood o f the Computer Age since b y speculation h e takes from the rich nations in grand style to hand o ut to Eastern Europe and Russia via several Soros Founda tions, to prepa re the way for “democracy” in those “poor” coun tries that had bee n bled dry by Comm unism. Who then is Soros? The official story says that he was born in 193 0 to Jewish pa rents and as a teen ager had b een chased from Budape st by the Nazis. He enrolled a t the Londo n Schoo l of Economics and in the mid-50’s c ame to the U.S. There he was magically drawn to Wall Street, but his c areer until 1969 was rather unspectacular.

From this fund, the Quan tum Group e volved, a family of investment fund s ope rating for the Dutch West Indies. Quantum is one of the most impressive “investment machines” in the world. I n eight of the last twenty-four years it made an “official” profit of over 50%, in two of those years even o ver 100 %. In the mean time Soros hande d business over to a g roup of managers and limits himself to d esigning the “great campaigns”. He put down h is principles in the bo ok The Alchemy of Finan ce , where he says what “financial speculators this is more important than real economic facts”. But this is but the p icture the media – an d we know w ho o wns them – paint of him. Who is he in reality? William Engdah l knows this to say abou t him: “Soros speculates on the world’s finan cial markets via h is s ecret off-shore compan y Quan tum Fund NV, a private Investment fund that hand les a portfolio of four to seven b illion US$ for several “clients”. The Quan tum Fund is registered in the tax haven of the Netherland s Antilles in the Caribbean . In order to evade control of his financial activities by the U.S. administration n ot a single U.S. citizen sits on the bo ard of Q uantum. Its directors are a curious mixture o f Swiss and Italian financiers. “Soros has bee n iden tified as a front man o f the Anglo-French Rothschild ba nking group . Unde rstandab ly neither he n or the Rothschilds want this important fact to be pub lic, so the tight links to h is friend s in the Lo ndon ‘Ci ty’, in the British foreign ministry, in the state of Israel and to his mighty friend s in the American Establishment would stay concealed.” Among the members of the boa rd o f the Quan tum Fund is one Richard Katz. He is at the same time head of the Rothschilds Italia S.p.A. in Milan and is also on the bo ard of the comm ercial bank N.M. Rothschild & Sons in Londo n. Another m ember of the boa rd is Nil s O. Taube . He is a partner in the Londo n investment group St. James’ Place Capital which coun ts Lord Rothschild a mong its main pa rtners. A frequen t partner of Soros in several of his s peculations – especially in the driving up of the gold quotation – is Sir James Goldsmith, a relative o f the Rothschild d ynasty. On the boa rd o f Q uantum we a lso find the head s of some h ighly “discreet” Swiss private ban ks (who he lp the syndicated of organized crime – weapon s and drugs – to launde r their mone y). Then there is Edgar D. de Piccioto, head of the Gene va private ba nk CBI-TDB Union Bancaire Privee, a main p layer on the gold and investment markets, Isidoro Albertini, hea d o f the Milan stockbroking compan y Albertini & Co., Beat Notz of the private ba nk Banque Worms at Gene va, Albertl Foglia, head of the Banca de l C eresio at Lugano . In the course o f the recent political corruption scanda ls in Italy it was foun d that several Italian po liticians kept their mone y at the Banca del C eresio. Appa rently Soros had more than just insider knowledge abo ut the weak points in Italian politics when he a ttacked the lira in September 1994 . William Engdah l explains: “Soros’ conn ection to the u ltra-secret internationa l finan ce circles of the Rothschilds is not just an ordinary or accidental banking conn ection. The extraordinary success Soros has on the h igh-risk finan cial markets c ann ot simply be explained with “gambler’s luck”. Soros has access to information channe ls, both government and private. Ever since the Second World War the Rothschild family tried to disseminate an a ura o f insignificance abo ut themselves.

Because o f its good relations to the h ighest places in the British secret services, the Rothschilds succeeded in preventing that their complicity with one of the worse illegal secret service ne tworks, the BCC I (Bank of Credit and Commerce Internationa l) was never mentione d.

I don ’t mean just “little boys”; I mean players on a n internationa l level of the b ig loop.] Not a single Western newspape r has s o far uncovered the fact that the Rothschild g roup linked with George Soros was at the hub o f the vast illegal network of the BCC I. The key person in these activities was Dr. Alfred Hartmann , the managing director of the Swiss branch of the BCC I (Banqu e de Comm erce et de Placement SA ), hea d o f the Zurich Rothschild Bank AG and the member of the bo ard of N.M Rothschild & S ons in London . He was also on the boa rd o f the Swiss branch of the Italian BNL an d was vice-chairm an of the N.Y. Inter Maritime Bank in Gene va. A friend ly former secret service man who had worked on the Soros case disclosed that in September 1993 Soros had amassed – together with a mighty group o f “silent partners” – a fortune in e xcess of 10 billion do llars to u se as a lever to unh inge the European currencies. AMONG THE PA RTNERS APPA RENTLY WERE THE LITTLE K NOWN METAL AND OIL DEA LER MARC R ICH [H: Now w here ha ve we hea rd abou t Mr. Rich lately, attached to Mr. Billy Cli nton po ssibly?] AND THE ISRAE LI ARMS DEA LER SHAUL EISE NBE RG. For decades Eisenbe rg had been working for the Israeli secret service and ha s important arms dea ls in a ll of Asia an d in the near East. A third partner of Soros is Rafi Eytan who b efore was the Mossad conne ction to the British secret service in London . Basically George Soros is another tool for economic and political warfare in the hand s of the Rothschilds. He is among those circles who three years ago started a malicious “Fourth Reich” campaign a gainst the reun ited Germany; Soros is very anti-German. In his 199 1 autobiograph y Unde rwriting Democracy Soros warned of the da nger that a reun ited Germany could d isturb the (power) balance in Europe. It is easy to see ho w the situation that existed be tween the wars c ould come u p a gain. A reun ited Germany becomes the strongest econo mic power and de velops Eastern Europe a s its hab itat...”a terrible witches’ brew”. His U.S. contacts put Soros v ery close to the finan cial and secret service circles around George Bush. His most important depo sit bank and the main lende r during attack on the European mone tary system in September 1993 was CITICORP, America’s largest bank. Soros c alled upo n the internationa l investors to unh inge the Deutsche Mark. When in late 1989 a reun ification b ecame probab le, a high-ranking Citicorp manager said: “Germ an unity will be catastroph ic for our interests. We have to take action to ensure a decline of the Deutsche Mark by abou t 30% so that G ermany will not be ab le to build up Eastern Germany to be come the econo mic factor with a ne w Europe .” According to his associates Soros has “an incredible ego”. He de scribed ho w during the war in o ccupied Hungary he could not have survived a s J ew, so h e had taken o n a second iden tity. What he d id n o say, however, was that he let a man shield h im from persecution who d id wealthy Jews out of their possessions, and that Soros lent him a han d. This is how he “survived” the war. Lea ving Budape st only two years after it had ended . Although he himself and the Jewish-owned media a re quick in attacking a ll his opponen ts, especially in Eastern Europe, as anti-Semitic, his J ewishne ss is based o n parts of the Talmud rather than on h is links with Jewish religion o r the Jewish peop le."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"163 Outwardly, Soros s uppo rts a whole spate of social activities, like “peace concerts” with Joan Baez, stipend s in Oxford for young Eastern European s, etc. But reality presents a d ifferent picture. Soros is persona lly respon sible for the chao s the “shock therapy” caused in Eastern Europe after 1989. He foisted ludicrous draconian measures upo n the weak governments there, which enab led h im to bu y up resources in wide pa rts of Eastern Europe an d [at] rock bottom prices. Take Poland a s an e xample: At the end o f 1989 , Soros organized a secret meeting be tween the Communist regime o f Rakowski with the leade rs of the then illegal oppo sition union o rganization Solidarnosc. The plan he p resented to both sides was as follows: The Communists shou ld let the oppo sition Solidarnosc take o ver the government to win the confiden ce of the peop le. Then the state shou ld de liberately drive its own state indu stries and agricultural businesses to ruin b y app lying astrono mical interest rates, by withho lding the ne cessary s tate loan s and by lumbering the compan ies with deb t they could ne ver repa y. Then Soros would get his rich internationa l business friend s to come to Poland and bu y up the no w privatized state compan ies. The most recent example is the huge steel compan y Huta Warsawa which toda y, so steel experts s ay, would cost abou t 3 to 4 billion US$ to bu ild if it was built by Western compan ies. A few months ago the Polish government agreed to take over the “deb ts” of Huta Warsawa and to sell the compan y now free o f deb t for 30 million US$ to the Milan compan y Lucchini. [H: That’s the way it works, chelas.] To instigate his plan Soros used a youn g friend , the Polish-Jewish e cono mic advisor Jeffrey Sachs who ho wever could no t begin h is advisory work in Poland because so far he could only show advisory work he did in Bolivia. So Soros set up ano ther one o f his many founda tions, the Stefan Batory Found ation which then in turn was the o fficial client for the advisory work of Sacks in Poland (1989 /90). In Soros’ own words he ha s worked or still works with the main ad visor of Lech Walesa, Bronislaw Geremek, with General Jaruzelski, Professor Trxeciakowski, a secret advisor to the ne w Polish minister for finan ce an d economy Leszec Balcerowicz, and with the latter himself. Soros admits that he had known that his economic “shock therapy” in Poland would lead to severe une mployment, to the closing of factories and to social tensions. That is why he insisted that Solidarnosc take over the government. Through his founda tion h e could app roach the most important opinion makers in the media, like Adam Michnik, and h is collabo ration with the U.S. embassy in Warsaw enab le h im to censor the media which proceeded on e-sided ly to supp ort his “shock therapy” and o pposed an y c riticism. What do you say now? Isn’t that the old Talmud-Illuminati strategy? Russia and the CIS states: Soros led a delegation to Russia, where h e had bee n collabo rating with Raissa Gorbachev since the 80s, to set up a further Soros foundation, The Cultural Initiative Founda tion. This is a further vehicle for him and his Western cronies to e nter the highest political echelons tax-free and proceed to “buy” the most important political and e conomic persona lities of the coun try. After a failed a ttempt with Gorbachev 1988 to 199 1 he changed over to the circles around Yeltsin. And a gain it was Soros who introduced h is “shock therapy” aided an d abetted by his friend Jeffrey Sachs. From Janua ry 2, 199 2 onwards Sachs’ “shock therapy” brought an unpreceden ted chao s and a foreseeab le hyper-inflation to Russia which was followed b y the be st scientific research insititutes fleeing to the West.

There were no more loan s for indu stry; the compan ies accrued a strono mical deb ts and the ruble inflation went out of control. Soros and his friens imm ediately profited from the situation.

This is just one example of the Soros exploitation. [H: How many of you STILL think Bill Cli nton just acciden tally pardoned poor old suffering Marc Rich?] Hungary: When Istvan Csurka, parliamentarian of the nationa l-socialist opp osition tried to protest the destruction of the Hungarian economy by the strategies of Soros and his friend s, he was branded a n “anti-Semite” and in June was excluded from the governing Democratic Forum. Yugoslavia: At the beginning of 199 0, Soros – in coop eration with the IMF – in what was then still Yugoslavia pu t down the gaun tlet for what then escalated into a war. Soros is also a friend of then dep uty secretary of state Lawrence Eaglebu rger, the form er ambassador to Belgrade and p atron o f Slobodan Milosevic. Eagleburger was formerly chairman of Kissinger Associates on whose boa rd Lord Carrington (Committee of 300) also sits. The latter’s mediations have d irectly fuelled the Serbian a ggression against the Croats and the Bosnians. Today Soros has founda tions in Bosnia, Croatia, Slovenia and a Yugoslav Soros Founda tion in Belgrade/Serbia. In Croatia h e uses fund s from his found ation to hire influen tial journalists of to d iscredit oppone nts of his “shock therapy” as anit-Semites or neo - Nazis.

RON HU BBA RD AND THE CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY Another persona lity with an interesting backgroun d is now deceased L.RON HU BBA RD , the founde r of the Scientology church. Since this boo k here is dea ling with ba ckgroun d knowledge, perhap s we shou ld look at the ba ckgroun d o f L.Ron Hubba rd whose organization is really v ictimized in pub lic. In the e arly days of MK ULTRA, the consciousness control program in the U.S, the former naval officer Hubb ard ha d researched the mechan ism of human thinking, knowing abo ut what secretly went on in the Navy. After refusing to comply with government research an d to join the control psychiatrists, he pub lished the book DIANETICS – the Mode rn Science of Mental H ealth. The boo k proclaimed mental freedo m and integrity as the birth right of humanity. The bo ok made the be stseller lists and Hubba rd’s “aud iting techniques” were described a s v ery successful. Some o f the processes that Hubb ard offered to reach mental freed om were secretly used b y the government to try and en slave the peop le. Ot her techniques described b y Hubba rd were indeed an tidotes to the MK ULTRA method s of consciousness c ontrol. The U.S. government then started a de vilish slande r campaign a gainst Hubba rd that was led b y the section for mental control at the CIA. The still youn g author had – p robab ly inad vertently – revealed the key of one o f the best-kept secrets of the cold war. His office was broken into a nd a protocol was s tolen that described the mind control techniques now know as PSY CH OTRONICS. Hubba rd and his c olleagues were ph ysically attacked an d only narrowly escaped a kidnap attempt. But the en orm ous influen ce by the Scientology churches shows that Hubba rd was not just an inno cent victim. And L. Ron surely knew a thing o r two abou t some important events of this world be cause h e not only spen t his"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"165 “m agician years” in Aleister Crowley’s Thelema Church in California, but he had also risen to the 33 rd degree in the Scottish Rite Masonry (perhap s even to the Illuminati degrees). But let’s get to the “real” stuff now. What I just told you so far can be foun d in o ther books, too. So no w I will tell you something abou t L. Ron Hubb ard an d his Church o f Scientology which you won’t find in an y other book on this plane t. The so-called “aud iting” techniques of Hubba rd are a very hand y way to regress somebod y into h is past as well as into h is past lives. So Hubb ard was very busily regressing thou sand s and thou sand s of peop le further and further back into their past lives, and he discovered the same strange inciden t in a ll of his c lients. This happened ab solutely independen tly from all the other sources I mentioned so far. He d iscovered inform ation stored in e very client’s s ubconscious and came up with the exact same story on e very client. In the constellation Pegasus there is a solar system called MARCAB , a sun surrounded b y seven p lane ts. But the sun is going to d ie. So the h umano id Marcabians who, in ou r term s would be “evil” in na ture, looked abo ut for ano ther planet to move to. Well, having g ood taste, they finally decided to take the plane t Earth. But there were peop le o n this plane t who were in the way for them to settle do wn he re with a ll their peop le. But on the other hand these peop le could be used a s slaves, freeing the Marcabians from having to work. So they made u p a p lan and contacted on e race down he r, with whom they made a dea l that, if they would he lp them to unde rmine e very nation and take them over silently, they would make them the ruling peop le of Earth. Well guess which peop le the Marcabian made the dea l with? BINGO! – the Hebrews! L. Ron Hubb ard found o ut what the Sumerian records, the Gilgamesh ep ic, the Christian Bible and o ther books describe a s well, that Marcabian “god-like” beings came down from hea ven with flying saucers. The ancient peop le n ot knowing abo ut machines, described them as s omething they could relate to: a flying cloud o r a “flying whee l that came from hea ven” with no ise and steam, or the “eye of God” (surely it must be an acciden t that the eye on the Illuminati sign on the on e-dollar bill has the shape of a saucer?). Hubba rd foun d out who EL SHADD AI was and still i s – the extraterrestrial race that made the original dea l with the Hebrews. And from then on this was taught in the Scientology Church, from the grade OT3 in the hierarchy upwards. You thing this is non sense? Then read the following sentences carefully! If this was non sensical, nothing more would ha ve happened be sides s ome ridiculing or snee ring. But you will always recognize b y the severity something is treated with whether it is in somebod y’s way. Of course the Khazar-Jewish Illuminati and the “Hebrew Blood Alliance” (the descenda nts of those Hebrews who had made the dea l w ith the Marcabians, another Secret Lodge) soon found o ut abo ut Hubb ard’s discovery, but his organization was alread y too po werful to fight. So the ruling Khazar-Illuminati started, as the Marcabians told them to (alread y in the Old Testament), undermining and infiltrating the organization and taking it over. So guess what happened ! In 198 1 the complete Church of Scientology in e very nation o n the plane t had bee n bought by the b iggest WHISKEY produ cer on Earth, the Canad ian Jew Bronfman. Now you will unde rstand why the most important peop le in Scientology as well as all the original founde rs had left t he Church at that time. Because since then the Church of Scientology is a Khazar-Jewish Illuminati organization. Surprised? I got this inform ation from the founde r of Scientology in Germany, as well as from peop le in the U.S. who worked with Hubba rd u ntil he d ied.

This s emi-secret organization is toda y one of the most influential societies in the U.S. and its members are withou t exception U.S. citizens. Toda y the CFR exercises a tight control over the n ations of the western world, be it directly through links to similar organizations or through institutions lik the World Bank in which it holds the chair. Since the found ation of the CFR all U .S. presiden ts except Rona ld Reagan had bee n members before their election. Reagan’s vice-president though, George Bush, was a member. In 197 7 Bush was even director of the CFR. The CFR i s c ontrolled b y the Rockefeller syndicate an d realizes the latter’s goal, the One World Government.

The Round Table Cecil R hode s as a member of the Comm ittee of 300 founded The Round Table in England on February 5, 189 1. Among the found ing members were Stead , Lord Esher, Lord Alfred Milner, Lord Rothschild, Lord Arthur Balfour. The structure of the g roup was – like Hitler’s SS – copied from the Society of Jesus, the Jesuit Order. The main o bjective of this group was the spread ing of the British Empire across the world with English as the world language. Rhode s strove – a s far as I know – really for a positive world government for the good of humanity, but the g roup was later infiltrated by Illuminati agents. Via the Rothschilds, the Round Table is linked with the Zionists, in the U.S. also with the Schiff, Warburg, Guggenhe im, Rockefeller and Carnegie families. Later, Lord Milner took over as the hea d o f this group out of which came – as alread y mentioned – the Royal Institute o f Internationa l Affairs (RIIA) and the CFR.

[H: You will be ab le to get it ALL if you just get the Phoen ix Journals .] The United Nations At the Freemason Congress in Paris, June 2 8-30, 1917 , the guidelines for the Le ague o f Nations were a ccepted and app roved. This was the beginning of the League o f Nations established in Gene va in 1919 . In 194 5, in San Francisco, the United Nations Organization e merged from this. It is an institution fashioned b y the Illuminati, the b iggest Masonic lodge in the world, in which a ll nations of the world shall unite. Ironically, yet as stated in the rules of Machiavellianism, item 4, summarized in the preface, the peop le o f all the nations of the UN now ask this institution to solve their problems and to intervene in their wars to end them, although the men beh ind that very institution have themselves instigated a ll the wars of the last two centuries. In pub lic the UN appe ars as a good friend to a ll and sundry who “will take care o f the affair”. At least forty-seven CFR members were among the American found ing de legates, including David Rockefeller. The UN emblem is a clearly Masonic s ymbol and I will compare it here to the American Masonic Great Seal. The globe of the UN and the circular form of the Great Seal with the inscriptions ANNU IT COEP TIS (He – God – ha s favored ou r unde rtakings) abo ve and Novus Ordo Seclorum (New Order of the Ages) below the p yramid show the o bjectives of the world rule. The 33 d egree fields of the UN globe an d the 33 stone s of the p yramid represent the 33 deg rees of the Scottish Rite Masonry. The Ears of corn with 13 g rains each to both sides of the globe, the 1 3 steps of the p yramid and the 13 letters in ANNU IT COEPTIS symbolize the 13 grade s of the Illuminati hierarchy and refer to the Jewish lucky number 13. The number 13 is the most important number in Freemasonry and ha s several meanings. Jesus had 12 d isciples and was Himself the thirteenth. In the caba la, in numerology and with the 13 th Tarot card, “Death”; the 13 mean s transformation, alchemy, rebirth, the Phoen ix rising from the a shes, knowledge of the secrets and then ce the ability of materialization and de materialization, the ab ility to create from the ether (as J esus, Buddha , Hermes Trismegistos, Saint G ermain an d many others did, e.g. making bread o ut of “nothing” (the ether), the so-called Philosophe r’s Stone ). On the ob verse side of the Great Seal w e find the Phoen ix (changed in 184 1 to the American ba ld eagle) symbolizing the 13, the transformation. He ha s 13 feathers in ea ch wing, 13 arrows in the right talon, and olive b ranch with 13 leaves in the left. His beak holds a scroll with the inscription E P LUR IBUS UNU M (Out of many, one ) has 13 letters, surm ounted b y 13 stars arranged in the shape of a star of David. O n the breast is a shield with 13 stripes representing the original 13 States unde r Congress."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"175 Remarks: The Germ an Dea petrol stations of the RWE (Rhen ish-Westpha lian Power Co.) are represented b y an upside-down p yramid with 13 stripes. In the U.S. there is a p etrol compan y “76”. 7 plus 6 e quals 13. There are hund reds of examples, just look at compan y logos, products, TV advertisement, State seals and flags, etc. The same goes for one of the largest Masonic c ompan ies in the U.S., Proctor & Gamble. The name has 13 letters and the compan y logo is one of the o ldest Masonic s ymbols: a bea rded man in a circle with 13 stars before h im. Perhaps it is of interest to n ote h ere that in the Wisconsin Repo rt , the chairman o f Proctor & Gamble said [in] 198 4 on TV: “ I made a pact with Satan! In e xchange for commercial success I have signed away my soul to h im...” (More inform ation abo ut the mean ing of these and other symbols c an be found in Gary Allen: None Dare Call It Conspiracy and in Masonic literature.) These are some of the most important organizations in finan ce, commerce an d politics who aim for a One World Government. One g roup of imm ense importance we ha ve no t considered yet is the Rockefeller Empire. But G ary Allen in h is two boo ks has dea lt with them at leng th, and it is following the same objectives. The Rockefeller empire is the main finan cing force beh ind the CFR, the Trilateral Comm ission an d the Club of Rome. You will probab ly have no ticed that you read the same names over and o ver again. It would be interesting to ha ve a list of names of the “coun cil of 13” or the “coun cil of 33”. But we know their goal and how they plan to reach it which is more important and shou ld in my v iew suffice. In Finkenstadt’s: Eine Gene ration im Banne Stans John Todd goes on: “If you a sk the head of a coven who is the world’s mightiest witch, he will say: Ruth Carter Stapleton, the sister of former presiden t Jimm y Carter. I don ’t know w hether Jimmy Carter is a Freemason. Normally, if you want to be a politician in the U.S., you ha ve to b e a Mason, because this is the way to en ter the po litical circles. Since Wilson, presiden t during the First World War, there was not one presiden t who d id no t belong to the Illuminati, except Eisenho wer, and he was c ontrolled b y them. There are abo ut 5,000 peop le in the world who have a deepe r insight abou t the Illuminati. Millions of peop le work for these few. The situation with the Freemasons is s imilar. O nly those in the 33 rd degree of the Scottish Rite had a lso the knowledge. The others simply don ’t have it. They own e very large pe trol compan y in the world. All the large mail order firms and 9 0% of the large dep artment stores. All computer cash registers in the U.S. are linked to a h uge computer in Dallas, Texas, called “The Beast”. This in turn is linked to two computers in Brussels and Amsterdam that are a lso called “The Beast”. CH AP TER 59 666 (SIX, SIX, SIX) One tene t of the New World Order is to have a Cashless Society. The Illuminati have well prepa red the peop le for this with the electronically readab le ban ker’s and credit cards, telephon e cards, insurance cards, petrol cards of the many oil compan ies, etc. The masses were ea sily convinced of the ad vantage s of this system by the argument that payment withou t cash is s afer, simpler and more practical. This idea has just got to b e thought through to the en d. As soon as the peop le ha ve a multitude of these electronically readab le cards they will be told that it is much easier still and e ven more practical to ha ve just one card instead o f many."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"176 This is the deb it card , the so-called ONE CR EDIT CARD FOR EVE RYTHING, that has alread y been introdu ced in New Zealand , Australia and Canad a. They still have the other credit cards, too, but the deb it card is alread y in circulation. Finally, we will have a laser tattoo. Invisible to the e ye, a bar code is tattooe d onto the right hand o r the forehead . The code on your hand then serves for payment, but in add ition for iden tification. A scanne r will read the code and a ll information neede d is “at hand ”. These are not idea s of the future, they are dea d serious. The laser tattoo has bee n tested in Disneyland for fifteen years alread y. Persons who were going to stay several days were given the choice b etween a pa ss or a tattoo o n the left han d. They wanted to see ho w peop le react to this whether in time they would get used to it. Official forms asking where the mark is preferred (F=forehead , H=han d) have bee n read ied on an internationa l level. These test to slowly get the peop le u sed to this before it becomes compulsory. As much as s even years ago Holland started to mark homeless persons with a laser tattoo on the forehead . The popu lace is told that in this way criminality, especially in Amsterdam, will be curbed . In the meantime laser tattoos have a lread y been officially introdu ced in places. Saying that business travelers c ould b e dea lt with more e fficiently, American a irports have bee n e quipped with scanne rs read ing the invisible tattoo o n the right hand . And the n umber using this service is constantly rising, because time is mone y . You will not actually be forced to accept the tattoo, but you will not have much choice unless you a re self-sufficient. At one point the shop s will no longer accept cash. And the peop les will be shown just how safe this new method is. Theft is no longer possible, for where there is no mone y, none may be stolen. Every criminal can be foun d by satellite be cause o f the laser tattoo, and it will no longer be possible to cross a frontier illegally. This will really be the total control of humanity. Free will has no room any longer, every step is s upe rvised, everything you d o, you o wn, how much capital you ha ve, can b e called up b y Big Brother. Make the effort and read George Orwell’s boo k “198 4”, the planned ne w age slave system is very well described therein. In the Bible , Revelation 13 :13-18, we read : “ ...And h e (the be ast) perform ed great and miraculous s igns, even causing fire to come down from hea ven to e arth in full view of men. Because of the signs he was given p ower to do on beha lf of the first bea st, he de ceived the inhab itant of the e arth. He o rdered them to set up on image in hon or of the bea st who was wounded b y the sword and yet lived. He was given p ower to give breath to worship the image to be killed. He a lso forced e veryone, small and great, rich and poo r, free and slave, to receive a mark on h is right han d or on h is forehea d so that no-one could b uy or sell unless he ha d the mark, which is the name o f the bea st or the n umber of his name. This c alls for wisdom. If anyone ha s insight, let him calculate the n umber of the bea st, for it is man’s number. His number is 666.” In these few phrases we find three revelations that toda y are very important to u s: “And he (the Beast) performed g reat and miraculous signs, even causing fire to come down from hea ven to earth...” This s ound s very much like an a tomic bomb. And who threw the first atomic bomb, and o n whose o rder? Well, we know alread y that the Americans are the b est tool of the Khazar- Jewish Illuminati ban kers and d id what their “m asters” told them to d o. Remember who Franklin D. Roosevelt was and who he worked for. “and h e was given po wer to give b reath to the image of the first beast, so that it could speak and cause who refused...” This message, too, is very clear. A living picture – the TV of course. And tell me o ne peop le on ea rth that doe sn’t worship the TV. The TV and Hollywood a re the be st tools of the Illuminati.

For the first time, we p resent a detailed study of the directors of the three networks, revealing their interlocking ba nking and indu strial conne ctions, indicating that instead of three major networks we a ctually have on ly one . NBE , a subsidiary of RC A, has the following directors: John Brademas, President of New York University, Chairman of the Federal R eserve Bank of New York (which do minates the other Federal R eserve Banks by its c ontrol of the money market), and director of the Rockefeller Found ation. Brademas had received the George Peabod y Award (George Peabod y established the Peabod y Education Fund which later became the Rockefeller Founda tion), and he was named Humanist of the Year in 1978 . Cecily B. Selby, born in London , England , nationa l director of the Girl Scouts, director of Avon Produ cts and Loeh mann ’s, a dress firm. She is married to James Coles, presiden t of Bowdoin College since 195 2. Peter G. Peterson, former hea d o f Kuhn , Loeb Co., and e x-Secretary of Commerce. Robe rt Cizik, chairman o f Coop er Indu stries (sales of 1.5 b illion pound s), and director of RC A and First City Bankcorp. First City was iden tified in Congressiona l testimony as one o f the three Rothschild ban ks in the United States. Thomas O. Paine, president of Northrup Co., a large defense contractor. Paine is a director of the influential Institute o f Strategic Studies in London , director of the Institute of Metals, London , American Ordinan ce Assn., and many other professiona l munitions associations. Dona ld Smiley, Chairm an R.H. Macy Co. since 194 5; he is also a d irector of Metropo litan Life and U.S. Steel, known a s Morgan-controlled firms, and director of Ralston-Purina Co., and Irving Trust. David C. Jone s, Presiden t of Consolidated Contractors, director of U.S. Steel, Kemper Insurance Co. Thornton Bradshaw, Chairman of RC A, director of Champion Paper Co., Atlantic Richfield Oil C o., Rockefellers Brothers Fund, and the Aspen Institute o f Humanistic Studies. Althou gh not listed a s a d irector of NBC, Andrew Sigler is a director of its parent compan y, RC A. Sigler is Chairm an of Champion Paper Co., and d irector of G ene ral Electric, Bristol- Meyers, and Cabo t Corp. (which traditiona lly has had hea vy CIA involvement)."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"178 Thus we find that NBC has many Rothschild an d J.P. Morgan conne ctions among its directors, who include the chairman o f the key to our monetary control, the Federal R eserve Bank of New York and other directors associated with such Rothschild op erations as Kuhn, Loeb Co., First City Bankcorp. and the Institute o f Strategic Studies in London . AB C-TV include s among its directors not one , but two, directors of J.P.

Thus we see many J .P. Morgan a nd Rothschild a ssociations among the directors of AB C which was recently purchased by Capital Ci ties Communications Co., whose chairm an is Texaco [?], whose most prominen t director is Robert Roosa, senior partner of Brown Bros. Harriman, a firm with close ties to the Bank of England . Roosa headed the Roosa Brain Trust at the Fede ral Reserve Bank of New York which p rodu ced Paul Volcker. Roosa and David Rockefeller were credited with selectiong Volcker to be chairman o f the Fede ral Reserve Board. John McKinley, Chairm an of Chase Manha ttan Bank; and Thomas Aquinas Vande rslice, who is Chairm an o f the e lectronics firm GTE, and a former Fulbright Scholar who is now trustee of the Aspen Institute o f Humanistic Studies. Of the three major networks, CBS is the p illar of the “Establishment”. It s finan cial expan sion for years was directed by Brown Bros. Harriman, whose senior partner, Prescott Bush, was a long time director of CBS. (His s on, G eorge, later became Vice-Presiden t and Presiden t of the U.S.). When Gene ral Westmoreland sought to recover damages from CBS for a vicious persona l assault on his reputation, Westmoreland seemed certain to win a stunn ing victory, until C BS brought in former CIA officials who testified that Westmoreland ’s c laims had no basis. George Bush was formerly HEA D of the CIA. Westmoreland surrend ered, and withdrew his s uit. Ted Turner’s expressed intention of buying control of CBS was app lauded b y millions of patriotic Americans, who had endu red its vicious assaults on decent Americans with no mean s of protest. However, Turner’s c ampaign was viewed in London a s a d irect attack on the po wer of the Bank of England and its American subsidiary, Brown Bros. Harriman. Turner was finally deterred from his goal by a clever m aneu ver which d iverted h im into purchasing MGM-United Artists, one o f whose d irectors is Alexande r Haig, former White"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"179 House intimate an d Secretary of State, later chairman of United Techno logies. Turner believed he was buying MGM’s extensive library of films for his WTBS channe l, but the Wall Street Journal later chortled that he had bee n tricked, and that most of the film library had been sold b efore he n egotiated for MGM. To finan ce his purchase o f MGM-United Artists, Turner intended to b orrow 515 b illion [?] through Drexel Burnha m Lambert, the American branch of the Banque Bruxelles Lambert, the Belgian b ranch of the Rothschild ope rations. CBS is a $4 .5 billion a year ope ration, which ban ks through the Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. William S. Paley, heir to a cigar fortune , has bee n chairman of CBS for m any y ears. To those who do n ot know of CBS ’ many CIA and British Intelligence conne ctions, he is suppo sed to run it as a one-m an ope ration. Directors of CBS are Harold Brown, who was Secretary of the Air Force from 1965 -69, Secretary of Defense from 1977 -81, and is now executive d irector of the Trilateral Comm ission; Roswell Gilpatric, who ha s been with the Kuhn Loe b law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore since 1931 , and served a s director of the Federal R eserve Bank of New York from 197 3-76; Henry B.

She is a grandda ughter of Endicott Peabod y, founde r of Groton, which trains America’s elite. She married Rona ld Tree, a h igh official of British Intelligence, and godson o f Marshall Field. She an d her husban d have an an cestral estate, Ditchley Park, to the Ditchley Founda tion. Located nea r Cambridge, it was W. Averill H arriman’s head quarters during World War II when he coordinated the partnership o f Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, who a ctively disliked and d istrusted each other. They usually checked with Harriman b efore a greeing to any action. The Ditchley Founda tion serves as a condu it for instructions to many American groups from the Tavistock Institute, an a rm of the British Arm y Institute for Psychological Warfare. Marietta Tree’s career gave rise to the term “ beau tiful peop le”, to describe members of the glittering internationa l set that represented the op erations of the World Order. She began working for Nelson Rockefeller in 1942 , and later served a s Ambassador to the United Nations. One victim of the CIA-British Intelligence ope rations at CBS was Roger Mudd , gene rally considered the brightest star among television repo rters. A direct descenda nt of Dr. Samuel Mudd , who spen t years as a political prisoner after the Civil War, Roger Mudd had a b rilliant 19-year career at CBS , but was passed over as a successor to Walter Cronkite in favor of Dan Rather. The e xcuse was that he was not “vicious eno ugh”, but the real reason was that he had “sand -bagged his c hances” (according to the Wall Street Journal) in 198 0 when he condu cted a revealing interview w ith Tedd y Kenned y which de stroyed Kenned y’s c han ces of being elected Presiden t. Because of continuou s Tavistock Institute-Bristish Army Institute o f Psychological Warfare control over the major television ne tworks in the United States, AB C, CBS , and NBC present many programs hea vily slanted in favor of psychiatry. They also e mphasize the current “liberal’ preoccupa tion with racial integration, crippled p ersons (who represent less of a threat to the mauling pa rasites), sports programs, and jiggle shows (also known in the trade as “t and a shows”). Althou gh the three n etworks are suppo sedly in b lood thirsty competition with ea ch other, viewing of the daily news programs reveals that each of the competing ne tworks shows exactly the same items of news each evening, usually in the same order. Almost all of the"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"180 “news” stories are p ropaganda items intended to further current World Order goals. The only v ariations perm itted in the iron control over network TV news is the final item, with is a “human interest” story. It usually praises a child who ha s c ollected considerable sums of mone y for UN ICEF, or some other World Order operation. For m any months, the three “independen t” networks have e mphasized a ha te campaign against South Africa o n their evening news presentations. O ne could hardly believe that they are attempting to “conque r” South Africa for the World Order, because the Rothschilds and Oppenhe imers won control of the rich South African gold and d iamond fields in the Boer War of 1899 . Toda y, DeBeers, the diamond monopo ly, is ope rated b y Oppenhe imer and the Rothschilds, as is the gold mining, exemplified b y their ownership of the giant Anglo- American Corp. of South Africa L td. Appa rently, the parasites would like to exterm inate the Boer popu lation of South Africa, which ha s lived there for three centuries, and replace it entirely with b lack workers. Some observers might call this “genocide”. Each evening the three networks outdo ea ch other in their campaign of vilification of the white citizens of South Africa. The rioting and looting committed b y the b lacks, as well as the vicious murders of their fellow blacks, are glossed over by the news repo rts as inevitable results of “white opp ression”. As usual, there is a more immediate ben efit gained from this c ontinuou s propaganda b arrage. The Rothschilds have p rofited enormously from currency speculations in the rand , i.e. the South African “dollar”. In a few months, they were ab le to drive the rand down from a value of $1.35, to thirty-five to forty-five cents, selling short all the way. On September 2, 198 5, they ran it back up a full ten cents, from thirty-five to forty-five cents. This might seem small change to non -investors, but it has paid off hand somely for the speculators. The fact that the network hate campaign continue s unaba ted suggests that there is still plenty of mone y to b e made in the rand. On July 31, 1985 , the Chase Manha ttan Bank announ ced it would no t rene w any loan s to South Africa . Businessweek , Aug. 12, 198 5, repo rted that this threw South African business into a pan ic. The ba nkers then demand ed that South Africa give b lacks the vote. Gavin Relly, chairm an o f the giant Oppenhe imer-Rothschild conglomerate, Anglo-American Corp., tried to force Botha’s government to a ccede to these demand s. Botha refused. Relly then went to Zambia to negotiate with the Communist-dominated African Nationa l C ong ress, prepa ratory to turning South Africa o ver to them. The similarity of the major networks evening “news” programs has given rise to a repo rt that, each da y, a list of ten or twelve “acceptable” news s tories is prepa red by British Intelligence in London for the n etworks, teletyped to Washington, where the CIA routinely app roves it, and is then delivered to the networks. The “selectivity” of the broad casters has never been in doub t. Edith Efron, in The News Twisters , (Mano r Books, N.Y. 197 2) cites TV Guide’s interview with David Brinkley, April 11, 1964 , with Brinkley’s declaration that “News is what I say it is. It’s s omething worth knowing by my stand ards.” This was merely v ainglorious boa sting on Brinkley’s part, as he merely read s the news s tories previously selected for him. Efron conclude s this important book, which was refused b y all the major New York pub lishers, as follows: “The n etworks actively slanted their opinion coverage in favour of the b lack militants and against U.S. policy on the Vietnam war. “The n etworks largely avoided the issue of violent radicals. “The n etworks actively favoured the Democratic c and idate, Hube rt Humphrey, for Presiden t over his Repub lican opponen t, Richard Nixon.” Efron could no t foresee in 1972 that, having lost the election to Nixon, the n etworks would engage in a successful bid to n egate the e lection an d drive h im from the White House through their trumped up “Watergate” campaign. It seems incredible that there are literally thou sand s of interesting and vital news items from all over the world a vailable to the n etworks’ evening “news” programs, and yet they are"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"181 restricted to the ten or twelve stories approved b y London . The American pub lic has known for years that something was amiss. As c able p rograms became a vailable, there were mass defections from the networks progagand a vehicles. Some a uthorities report that the three networks have lost 40% of their viewing aud ience, although they are d esparately trying to conceal this. If forced to revise their advertising rates accordingly to their actual viewing aud ience, they would be technically ban krupt, as their revenue s would no t cover operating expen ses. Television is a medium of light. It is a reflection upon a ll of us that we ha ve a llowed it to b e taken o ver by the forces of darkness. What had bee n taken from us can’t be regained . Taxation is the medium by which the pa rasites maintain econo mic control over us because we refuse to a dmit the obvious fact that “Taxation is the price we pa y for irrespon sibility”. We advise Americans to g o to the United States Attorney and ask for an investigation o f Criminal Syndicalism. We have e xposed in great detail the interlocking Rockefeller Founda tion, Ford Found ation an d Fede ral R eserve control of television and the goals of the World Order which they espou se. There are adequate laws on the books which forbid a ll of these a ctivities. Corpus Juris Secund um 46, Insurrection an d Sedition, sec. 461c, “Sabo tage and syndicalism aiming to abo lish the p resent political and social system, including direct action an d sabo tage.” Corpus J uris Secund um 46:462 b, “Statutes against criminal syndicalism app ly to corporations as well as to individua ls organizing or belonging to criminal syndicalist society; eviden ce of the character and activities of other organizations in which the a ccused is a member or is affiliated is admissible.” This mean s that any of the networks presenting a program inimical to the interests of the American n ation, and seeking to change its character to that of a “1984 ” style d ictatorship, can be charged unde r the law of the United States. Corpus J uris Secund um 22A iden tifies Criminal Syndicalism: “In a prosecution for being a member of an organization which teaches and ab ets c riminal syndicalism, eviden ces of crimes committed b y past or present members of the organization in their capacity as members is admissible to show its c haracter,” Peop le v. LaRue, 216 P627 CA276 . This mean s that you can introdu ce into a charge of criminal syndicalism any information abou t activities of any organization with which an y director of any television corporation is involved.

This c alls for wisdom. If anyone ha s insight, let him calculate the n umber of the bea st, for it is man’s number. His number is 666....” In the Caba la, as in the Tarot Card VI, the Lover, the n umber 6 symbolizes Temptation, the way from the spiritual into the ph ysical, whereas the n umber 9, the n umber of wisdom, symbolizes the way back from the physical towards the spiritual. The Hopi Indians of North America ha ve a prophe cy that states: “No-one will be ab le to bu y or sell if he h as not the mark of the Bear. When this mark will be visible, the third Great War will come.” Imagine that the Hopi Indian was s hown a vision several hund red years ago in which he sees a b ar code . Since he n aturally in u nfamiliar with toda y’s name for it, he describes it as looking like the traces a bea r leaves when he sharpen s his claws on a tree. The bar pattern on the produ cts have several lines that, depend ing on thickness and spacing, stand for a specific number whereby the produ ct and its price can be identified. You can see the twelve shorter doub le lines, like the tracks of the bea r’s claw, six to the left and six to the right (in the b eginning there used to b e only five). In add ition there are THR EE longer lines, left, center and right. If you no w look for a 6 in the short lines and compare it with the long, you will see that the longer one s are always the same in e very bar code a ll over the world, only the short lines c hange. The computer hen ce always read s 666. And I promise you that if things don ’t drastically chan ge, and soon , we will soon be unab le to but anything withou t a bar code . And then, soone r or later, you will have it on the hand or on the forehead .

Thus it is indispen sable to live in the countryside for lead ing an independen t and self-sufficient life is all but impossible in a city.

It is time you get serious abo ut these things, for these writings are old and ou tdated – you a re now in the final stages of the take-over and you still blame God and Brother. Look at self and perchance you’ll see your brother differently.] Another interpretation of the n umber 666 . This is numerology, the calculation of the n ame. As stated in the e xcerpt from the Bible , this concerns the number of its name (the Beast’s). According to the Caba la e very letter correspon ds to a number. Every letter and every number in turn has a specific meaning o r character. If I know the mean ing of the numbers, I can determine from the calculated number character and fate. An e xample: a b c d e f g h I  J k l m n o p q r  S t u v w z y z  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 K A R L V O N H A B S B U R G 2 1 9 3 4 6 5 8 1 2 1 2 3 9 7 15 15 33 6 6 6 666 = 6+6+6 = 18. The 1 8 correspond s in the Caba listic numerology to confrontation with emoton, secrets, falsehoo d, lies, egoism, criminality, destruction, acciden t-prone, general difficulties, illness, danger... The eighteen th Tarot card is “The Moon ” This c ard symbolizes emotion, grief, solitude, illness, acciden t-pronene ss, dreams (difficult times). I took this numerological deciphe ring of the name o f Karl von Habsburg from an Austalian boo k c alled The United States of Europe . The a uthor, a devout Christian, describes the Habsburg dynasty with their dee ds. He tries to prove that the Holy Grail is not – a s hitherto assumed – a vessel that had contained the blood of Jesus. He further states – a s do Baigent, Leigh an d Lincoln in their book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail – that Jesus was not only married b ut had also fathered children. The marital status of Jesus is one o f the great secrets of the Bible , he says. And in Juda ism this is strange beha vior indeed . From the Gospels, he writes, it is known that a large n umber of his disciples had been married (Peter, for instance) and Jesus taught just that. In the Gospel of Matthew 19: 4-5:"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"184 “ Haven’t you read, that at the beg inning the Creator ‘made them male and female’, and said, ‘for this reason a man will l eave h is father and mother and b e united to his wife, and the tow will become one flesh’?” Marriage was c ompulsory according to Jewish custom. The u nmarried state was s everely judged. If Jesus had not been married, he would no t have bee n accepted by the Jewish peop le a s he was, and this kind of break with Jewish tradition would ha ve foun d some mention in some o f the gospels. Further Jesus was c alled Rabb i by his disciples. And the Jewish law of the Mishnah clearly states that an u nmarried man cann ot be a rabb i. Baigen, Leigh & Lincoln ad d: “Unde rlying most Christian theo logy is the assumption that Jesus is God incarnate. In other words God, taking pity on His creation, incarnated Himself in that creation and a ssumed human form. By doing so He would b e able to a cqua int Himself at first-hand the vicissitude s of human e xistence. He would come to und erstand , in the most profound sense, what it mean s to b e a man – to confront from a h uman standpo int the lone liness, the angu ish, the helplessness, the tragic mortality that the status of manhoo d entails. By dint of becoming man, God would come to know man in a way that the Old Testament does not allow. Renoun cing His Olympian aloofness and remotene ss, He would pa rtake, directly, in man’s lot. By doing so, He would redee m man’s lot – would validate and justify it by partaking of it, suffering from it and eventually being sacrificed by it. “The symbolic s ignificance of Jesus is that he is God exposed to the spectrum of human experience – exposed to the first-hand knowledge of what being a man e ntails. But could God, incarnate a s Jesus, truly claim to be a man, to e ncompass the spectrum of human experience, withou t coming to know two of the most basic, most elemental facets of the human cond ition? Could God claim to know the totality of human existence without confronting two such essential aspects of humanity as s exuality and paternity?” [H: Wow!] The authors go on to describe how after the flight from the ho ly land , the wife o f Jesus with her family found refuge in the south of G aul where the lineage was c ontinue d in a Jewish comm unity. It seems that during the fifth century this linea ge united by marriage with the royal line o f the Franks and thus founded the Merovingian d ynasty. The descenda nts of Jesus have survived a ll attempts at wiping them out. Later the royal blood was s afeguarded by the Prieure de Sion. This is a secret society whose a im it was – a ccording to these authors – to keep an d guard this secret abou t the marital status of Jesus. G rand Masters were a mong others: Leon ardo d a Vinci 1510 -1519 ; Robert Fludd 159 5-1637 ; Isaac Newton 1691 -1727 ; Karl A. Emanue l von Lo thringen 1746 -178 0; Maximilian Franz v on Habsburg- Lothringen 178 0-1801 . The hou se of Habsburg-Lothringen descend s – a ccording to the au thors – d irectly from the Merovingians and therefore from the linea ge o f Jesus. There are however several other families who can claim the same for themselves. Baigent, Leigh & Lincoln say to this: “During the n ineteenth century, the Prieure de Sion, working through Freemasonry and the Hieron du Val d’Or, attempted to establich a revived an d ‘upda ted’ Holy Roman Empire – a kind o f theo cratic United States of Europe, ruled simultaneou sly by the Habsburgers and b y the radically reformed Church. This enterprise was thwarted by the First World War and the fall of Europe’s reigning d ynasties. But it is not unreasonab le to suppo se that Sion’s present objectives are basically s imilar.” It is very probab le that these aims are still followed toda y. Judging from the speech Otto von Habsburg – Honorary Knight of the Deutschritterorden (Teutonic Order of Knights) – gave on May 9, 1993 at Bad Mergentheim befor the Deutschritterorden , it is still i n its interest to establish a “Fatherland Europe”. It is most certainly no a cciden t that recently the son of Archduke Otto von Habsburg (m ember of the Comm ittee of 300), Karl von Habsburg,"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"185 shou ld marry the daughter of Baron Heinrich von Thyssen-Bornemisze (also member of the Comm ittee of 300). The a uthor sees a link between the p urported Habsburg h istory, the 666 de ciphe ring of Karl von Habsburg’s name a nd of the Revelation. By the way, the Habsburgers are in possession o f the spea r with which the Roman centurion Gaius Cassius had pierced the side of Jesus. Aroun d the myth of this s pear several thou sand p ages have been written (among them Trevor Ravenscroft: The Spea r of Destiny ). Whether the e vents concerning the family of Jesus did a ctually happen this way or not, the Catholic Church h as s omething to hide and reacts very sensitively – p robab ly they secret pertinen t documents. The que stion whether Jesus was a father or not is by itself unimportant because it won’t change an ything in toda y’s world, except perhaps for some possible de scendan ts or some fana tical so-called faithful who confoun d the p erson with the importance of his teaching, who do no t succeed in translating their faith into a ction. There is a b ig d ifference between be lieving in Christianity and practicing it. I don ’t claim that Karl von Habsburg is unmasked b y the numerological value of his name as the “Antichrist”. This was taken as an example of one way of looking at the n umber 666, and there are many more peop le who ha ve that number. So d o not create a ne w ene my concept. Yet it could be that he is still to take up a key position; remember that the Habsburg dynasty belong s to the Black Nobility as well as to the Committee of 300. Just be alert abo ut what goes on a roun d you while you spiritually develop further. That the so-called Antichrist is not to b e foun d externally will be further discussed in the chap ter “What Can We Do?” A further example yet, in the Old Testament (1 Kings 10:14) “The weight of the gold that Solomon received yearly was 666 talents.” Peop le of the Thule-Gesellschaft had interpreted thus: Since 66 6 is – next to 33 3 and 99 9 – also a gold standa rd, and since in Revelation 13 :18 it is s aid that the Beast, whose n ame is 666 and who causes everyone to ha ve the mark on the right hand or on the forehead , is the JEWISH MONETARY P OWER. That the n umber 666 ha s to d o with the b ar code s, the credit card systems, with ba nks then and with mone y, is c learly shown b y the fact that the number of the code of the World Bank number is 666. Or that the cards of the Australian ba nks in Bombay is c ode d 666 . New American credit cards now also show a 666 . The Olivetti computer system “P 6060 ” uses numbers s tarting with 666 . Computer receipts all over America have a group of grey dots on them surround ing the number 666. Every Israeli lottery ticket has the number 666 stamped on. The internationa l line a ccess c ode in Israel is 666 , etc. Rockefeller’s EXX ON i s also interesting:  E X X O N  5 6 6 6 5 The doub le cross which is form ed by the two combined X’s in EXXON (have a look at their emblem) is an old symbol of the Scottish Rite a s well as of Satan worshippe rs. But there is still ano ther mean ing to the 666 , the most important one in my v iew, of which I have no t fond mention in an y other book s o far: Who introdu ced a nd u ses the credit cards in the world? The banks. Not the little one s, but the b ig one s. And who a re the big internationa l bankers? The Khazar-Jewish one s – the Illuminati! OK. And who a re the Jews (especially the Talmudists) waiting for? The Messiah! And why are they waiting of the Messiah? Because the Talmud tells them: “When the Messiah comes, all will be slaves of the Jews!” (Erubin 43b ) This Messiah must be a very nice guy, if he wants to make you and me to be slaves of the Jews.

(Erubin 43b ). So what doe s all this mean” Well, to explain this, I have to jump ahea d and state some views from the last chapter of this boo k. To und erstand what life is, you ha ve to know that life is based o n the law of Cause an d Effect (in ph ysics the Law of Oscillation). Jesus s aid very clearly what this mean s for every one of us (whether Illuminati or not): “To ea ch everything happen s according to h is belief!” Whatever you be lieve will be “reality” for you. Jesus also said that “hea ven and he ll ae inside of us!” If we be lieve in Satan, in a n ene my and a he ll, in a force that is trying to h arm us, life will prove to u s that our belief is c orret. Whatever we a re be lieving, comfortable o r painful, life is proving to us that we a re right. Whatever the inpu t we give into the computer, the printer is going to print it out. Somebod y who be lieves that the forces of polarity – po sitive and n egative – complement each o ther and therefore can b oth b e used in a constructive way, will be p roven right in this belief system as well. And b oth are right. (You would think s omebod y v ery stupid if he claimed that the n egative po wer coming out of the socket was “evil”.) That’s what Jesus mean t with h is s tatement. And that’s what the Illuminati try to keep you a way from – from recognizing that it’s y ou who de cides whether you ha ve a happ y life or not. According to the “Law of Affinity” life is a mirror or our belief systems, whatever they are. And be cause of this, life o n Earth is a reflection o f the belief systems its inhab itants hold on to. And most of the peop le on the Earth have been made to believe that there are two forces fighting ea ch other and that these forces are outside of them! Which is absolutely crazy, and there is nothing like it, neither in ph ysics nor chemistry nor in magic that proves that claim. Jesus also said: “Look at Nature – she is like an ope n book”. Do it and you will see that everywhere in this universe a ll forces work together. So, the outer world will reflect the wrong be lief pattersn to everyone . The outer world doe s not distinguish be tween good or bad – it just reflects what is put in. Understand that the big game the Illuminati play is based upon the trick to make peop le believe that success, love, luck, G od... are all to be found o utside of them (in mone y, work or sex, in church or m osque, as the Christian, Muslim or Jewish God). Therefore you be come depende nt on them, get caught up in their traps. If you start getting your answers from withing yourself, t hrough watching, recogn izing, feeling and mainly through listening to your intuition, you will get real answers, because these answers are proven to you in life, and nobod y, no power in the universe, can take a way what has been proven to you inside a lread y. This is important to und erstand the following. [H: Read ers, be VE RY CAREFUL with this as we reach into the “Author’s c onclusions”, for you must have good data “in” to bring good conclusions and correct data “out” of that “inside”. Each “norm al/ordinary” person is born in knowledge of “right” and “wrong’. There is very definitely no full definition of “goo d” or “bad ”; however, friend s, do not for one minute believe that there is no “good ” or “evil”, FOR BOTH EXIST – AND THEREIN IS THE TEST OF MANKIND IN H IS ULTIMATE REA LIZATION.] So a ll the Christians and Muslims and u nknowing Jews are looking on the o uter for a Christ or a Messiah (Antichrist). And they will find an Antichrist in the o utside world, the manifested “Bad Guy”, and they will see their belief system proven. They will be shown an “Antichirst” made b y the Illuminati to keep them in their narrow-m inded “good and e vil” belief system. The Christians will say: “See I told you that I would be right!” And they will be wrong! This person will show uop in the “world thea ter” some time b etween 1996 and 2000 .

He will realize what actually goes on, and I’m certain that he will become conscious abou t himself and his real powers and will choo se to go h is own constructive way. I know abou t him and h e knows abou t me, and there are much, much h igher aspects of us guiding us both. Things are working out fine, for every one of us. But the Illuminati will try everything they can to make their plan happe n.

These Christians will point to this man-m ade Antichrist and won’t recogn ize that they have forgotten to work on themselves, on their own egos, because that’s where the real Antichrist is. As Jesus said: “Heaven and he ll are inside of us!” That’s what this mean s.

They make you be lieve it through the churches, their “nut hou ses”, that you a re the tool of some forces, be they Satan or God. And if you be lieve it, it will beo me YOUR reality! And I’m telling you right here, right now: Don’t believe this non sense! There is just one power, and , besides all kinds of other nice things, this power created b y two forces, positive and n egative to hold together the third d imension with its twelve o vertone s.

But any critical person canno t den y the conflicts, the hatred, the wars and unrest, the hunger and the misery in this world, the splitting up o f nations, the still escalating racial hatred in EVE RY country of this world, the striving for independen ce, the po werlessness of the rulers, the corruption of the po liticians, the escalating pe rversion and b rutality of humanity, the un limited indeb tedne ss of the states, the instability of the currencies, the e conomic c rises, the collapse of agriculture, the une mployment, the unrest amont the popu lace an d abo ve a ll the god lessness of the peop le. It is rather a strange coinciden ce that the present situation of the world so perfectly fits the Protocols and that the plan of Albert Pike ha s bee n translated into a ction with such frightening accuracy. I would a lso like to recall the fact that five ROTHSCH ILD agents were present at the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which can be verified in an y history book. They acted as ADVISORS to the leade rs of England, France an d the U.S. And since we know that the treaty was fashioned in such a way that war was absolutely inevitable EVE RYB ODY will see what had been the ad vice o f the ROTHSCH ILD AGENTS. Think abou t this c onscientiously. To quote Franklin D. Roosevelt: “In politics nothing e ver happen s acciden tally! If something occurs, you can be sure that it had been p lanned that way!” Thus I come to the conclusion that up to this point in h istory all the important events in politics and finan ce run according to the Illuminati’s guidelinges. Only those in the know can see the interrelation. If you think back to the subject of information control and to the list of names, you will unde rstand why only v ery few “really know”. This is also the reason why Hitler had a ll the o ccult and edu cationa l literature b urned . As Dieter Ruggebe rg says: “Occultists can on ly be recognized b y occultists!” An a theist or materialist will never unde rstand or be able to follow the trains of thought or the motives of an o ccultist. One distinguishes between constructive (or positive – a lso called spiritualists) and de structive (or negative) occultists; the positive uses his k nowledge of the spiritual laws to unde rstand life and thereby to he lp himself and others, the nega tive uses it exclusively for himself, i.e. for the realization of his own e go. Thus the highest occultists (negative in this case) of the p lane t, the Illuminati, the e lite an d all their follower lodges occupy, as the upp ermost levels in finan ce, politics, econo mics, religion an d science, almost all the lead ig positions and they use the o ld satanic knowledge for their plans. On the other side are the six billion peop le who pu rposefully are kept ignorant in falsified religions, atheism, realism, materialism and trusting science, thus s peak a d ifferent language an d exist in this world with na ry an idea what is really going on . Confirming this, Ruggebe rg writes that: “All those atheists and agno stics who chorus with the “progressive’ section of the Church that occultism and magic is only a d aft supe rstition d o not at all realize that they fell prey to a will fully planned po litics of certain church and lodge circles. Many a famous atheist would turn in h is grave if he knew that his hon ors and decorations were p ut on them by members of occult orders and lodges to use him as a tool for the dissemination of certain mislead ing idea s.” ( Gehe impolitik – Secret Policy ).

This is also the reason why they are so inconceivably rich. These peop le o n the one hand want to be respected an d worshipped , while on the other hand an d in secret they bring d isaster to the nations and instigate wars.

Where do you be lieve a Chinese, Russian, Arab, Germ an, American, Serb o r any other government gets the mone y to bu ild its armaments indu stry?

Naturally from the internationa l ban kers. It is not for nothing that Rothschild o wns a ba nk in the Kremlin. This is why they are called INTERN ATIONAL ba nkers. They are n ot especially concerned abou t England o r the U.S. Wherever m one y can be goy y ou will find the internationa l bankers.

Moreover, YOU are paying massive interest on mone y that has no VA LUE whatsoever – and you end up pa ying for it at least twice and sometimes a hun dred times over. Your are but bon d-slaves, citizen. Then you pa y taxes on more taxes on the things you bu y or licenses you get. Remember, that as long as a thing or “r ight” can b e confiscated for any reason, taxes or otherwise – IT IS NOT YOUR S!] If these bankers don ’t want a war there is no credit and therefore n o arms. It is that simple. If a n ation wants to go to war, it first has to ask the ba nkers whether of not they agree to it. If they do agree, the arm aments indu stry is built up with their finan cial suppo rt and off you go.l D o they not agree, because it might contravene their own p lans, there is no credit and withou t mone y there a re n o arms and withou t arm s there is no war. In the case of war though it is not a question of a few million, it concerns sums in the b illions. As I have shown in the course o f this book, the money for the Bolsheviks, for the Germ ans before and d uring the Second World War, for the Russians, for the Communist sysem and also for Sadda m Hussein a lways c ame from the same lende rs. That is why nothing is ever acciden tal in po litics or war. If there is a war, it must have been p lanne d, otherwise no funds would ha ve been made available. Consequently the present and future troub le spots are wanted and pe rfectly planned to reafh the one o verriding g oal, the One World Government . The Illuminati themselves c laim that they have set up this one world government to finally establish globa l pea ce. It is interesting that they use war as a mean s to get there. Do you think that they will chan ge and act differently once the world government is established? By their deed s ye shall know them! Actually there is nothing to b e said against a world government; it is the u ltimate goal of this plane t, if only it is led by peop le who ha ve the well-being of their fellow-m en o n their minds and who vouch for development mentally, spiritually and abo ve a ll freely, i.e. no secrets before anyone , the right for free de velopment for everyone b y presenting the knowledge so far held ba ck s hou ld this be wished .

The Swiss have no p roblem with this because thy have their shelters and guns in their homes and a lso live in the mountains where the hu ngry will not want to climb. But the Germans will have to be rather defenseless against these events. For the elite and our politicians who “really have ea rned the privilege” of survival there are numerous perfectly laid ou t unde rground ba ses with food and e verything necessary for the survival of several decades. Yet the na ïve rank and file has c onveniently been forgotten . Just think this through. How w ould you react if tomorrow the Serbs would gun Munich o r Stuttgart? Form er Illuminatus George Orwell in h is book 1984 has clearly decribed ho w things c ould be in the e yes of the Illuminati. This include s c ontrol by a laser tattoo.

A lot can be don e if the peop le of all nations would give up their appa lling ignorance an d would really start to be concerned abou t humanity and the p lane t Earth. But through the games of the Illuminati we a re so bea utifully caught up in ou r own small world o f problems that most have long lost track and therefore ha ve pu lled ba ck from the world’s activities. Just a short example illustrating this last remark: The mass media (controlled b y the Illuminati) is drumming into you that in o rder to be a good citizen you ha ve to ha ve a great car, your own hou se, a family, a career, designer clothes, etc. After seeing this picture o f the p erfect “m ember of society” for decade s on TV and in print your subconscious has absorbed the information and no w you a re convinced that you really need a ll these things (the same o f course goes for attitude s and fashions). To get all this you ha ve to really work hard. But you canno t work fast eno ugh. You want these things now. So you bu y on credit and with installment plans and slowly but surely y ou a re caught in the n et that has been laid o ut for you so p erfectly, and ob ligations and de btrs will tie you up for decades. Add to this the family and the kids, the mone y for holidays, car repa irs, etc. you a re finally trappe d in the vicious c ircle “created b y y ourself”, with your oh so many problems, so you find neither time n or inclination to check whether what you happen to be doing is what you actually want to do. And then some time you d iscover that you a re no t at all happ y with what you created in the outer world and that toda y y ou would go abou t it differently but that now it is too late. This is, simply put, what is planned in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and that for decade s happen s in a ll coun tries of this world. In add ition you might feel inad equate to dea l with a ll the problems and you look for refuge in d rugs and alcoho l. Once you ha ve reached that point, the race of this life is all but over anyway. Yet some still make it. In the ne xt chap ter I will show that it is never too late. But treating symptoms to your problem or of the conditions presented in this book. Had you checked whom you vote for and what you suppo rt daily, the world would look different toda y and the Illuminati would ha ve no po wer over you. With “you” I mean every human be ing on this plane t.

But get to the point, don ’t circumlocute and just discuss . Possibel solutions in the outer, the material world a re given in some of the bo oks in the literature list. Many historians themselves have been caught up in the web of entanglements and have transferred their own cause-finding and respon sibility to the Zionists and the Jews. Some Christian researchers went for the Freemasons and be lieved they were guilty of it. Not all the members of the Rothschild family are beho lden to the ideo logy of world rule! So do n ot make sweep ing judgements! The reason for this book is NOT to pinpo int some p erpetrator or other, but to recognize the p rinciples and the mode s of action an d to look now at possible solutions. Again very clearly: The Illuminati are n ot part of any religion, party, nation or group , but they used them all as cover. Therefore I would like to stat once more that this game had started thou sand s of years before any of the persons mentione d in this book were e ven b orn, and it will not end with them either. Those we call toda y Satanists or who a re representatives of the Zionist comm unity (Rothschild, Warburg) are on ly pawns ina game with much higher stakes.
