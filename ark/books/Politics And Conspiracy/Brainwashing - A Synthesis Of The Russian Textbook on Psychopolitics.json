'Liberals' attacked this pamphlet as a \"forgery\", ignoring the Implications in that term . 'Conservatives', fearing a loss of credibility by distributing It, limited its circulation . Evidence that psychopol it ics was then operative was minimal, but the handwriting was on the wall . Its future was being secu- red by a cadre of adepts who had long before captured the citadels of learning,and were assiduously developing support systems for the Intended assault on the American mind, and training the troops to nan the assault . The extent of their success can be meas- ured t oday . i t Is evident in the trust the people place in 'leaders', in naive disre - gard of the evidence that that trust is not warranted . The almost total nonresistance to official implementation of a system of management and control, in defiance of law and tradition, is another indicator . Altered perceptions of values, morality, responsibi- lity, loyalty - all the standards by which integrity is measured- starkly proclaim the validity of the use of psychopolitics, as documented in these pages . The existence of the systematic use of psychopolitics has a direct relation to a geopolitical war which was declared against established institutions many years ago . Ne- ver publicly acknowledged as an integrated movement, the record shows that activists in the fabian/socialist/communist left present a united front against traditional forms of social organization . In time of need, they openly identify with each others causes . Probably the earliest visible warning of the use of psychopolitics as a condition- ing tool occurred during world war two, when thoughtful people found it Inexplicable that the excesses of the Nazis were (justifiably) excoriated, while the equally vile Soviet a- trocities were not . After the war, the coddling of radical collaborators in high government positions, in contrast to the treatment of those whose duty it was to uncover them, is a classic example of mass conditioning of the mind . In the 1950s, penetration of the public schools became visible . Radical departures from traditional subjects and methods spark- ed reaction from the citizenry . Parents be- gan to object on the grounds that their children were being adversely affected ."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Whether concern was roused by the gen- eral trend toward 'softened' curriculum, and 'permissiveness', or by specifics - censored textbooks, neglected basics, or intrusion in- to areas which traditionally belonged in the home - parents were astounded at the virulent attacks by school personnel, which met all efforts to correct or alter those policies . Then, In the late fifties, the \"mental health racket\" swung into full gear, and it triggered the beginning of open warfare be- tween officialdom and the citizenry . It was this conflict which finally brought recog- nition that there was an \"invisible\" layer of government which was not acting by the consent of the governed, but was, in fact, autocratically denying the right of dissent . Years passea, before it became evident that this war was geopolitical - involving the great globe Itself, and all who lived . Still more years, before there was documen- ted evidence that psychopolitics was an in- tegral element of official policy, determi- ned by the \"invisible government\" . During world war two, military experts recognized that a tenth principle of warfare had been added to the nine historic strate- gies by which wars had been waged in past conflicts . That tenth principle Is impli- cit in the precept that \"supreme excellence in warfare consists of winning in advance of perceptible hostilities\", and the experts identified it as \"paralysis of the will to resist\" . Psychopolitics, as delineated in this pamphlet, is the embodiment of the tenth principle of warfare, activated against the American people by, among others, officials on the public payroll, working In the role of 'public servant' . Those who recognize the extent of the penetration of the American mind, by use of the strategies of psychopolitics, may well wonder if it is not too late . The fact is that it will never be any earlier . Today, the situation is similar to that which was the lot of Washington and his troops at Valley Forge, but the stakes are even greater . They faced an enemy able to kill only the body, and deny them physical liberty . The enemy within our own govern- ment has the power and the means to destroy both body and soul, and can deny spiritual freedom as well as physical .

These students were composed of professors, teachers, psychologists, nurses, social welfare workers, etc . This 'booklet (said to be one of their text-books) speaks for itself . We now seem to be reaping the results of that training . In Beria's opening address he stated among other things that shock treatment and brain sur- geryry .must be made to be \"common and accepted .\" This' is - in effect now .

Children are diag- nosed as \"schizophrenic\" and treated with so many shock treatments most of them \"were not able to function in the community . They either had to be exempted from school for sometime and event- ually improved with psychotherapy (if this was available to them), or . they had to be re-com- mitted soon . After a stay in the state hospital for anywhere from several months to 4 years, they are discharged with the diagnosis changed to \"behavior disorder .\" This change of diagnosis is so frequent that it has become the \"RULE RA- THER THAN THE EXCEPTION .\" In fact Dr . Mosse stated : : \"We have studied 60 cases below the age of 14 at the Lafague Clinic and in private - 3 -"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"practice .

This puts the problem into a wrong focus, namely into the field of mental illness of unknown origin inherent in the child, instead of into the field of social pathology to which the child is reacting .\" And he states again : \"Our cases show how erroneous dogmatic thinking may lead to contraa dictory therapeu- tic procedure . Often they are dangerous for the child . At any rate, they deprive the child of constructive social and psychotherapeutic measures . In many cases anti-convulsive med- ication and then ECT (electro-shock treat- ment) was recommended in the same case within a period of a few weeks . Children of all ages are being SUBJECTED TO LOBO- TOMIES ON THE SAME BASIS .\" \"Child schizophrenia is at present in the United States a fashionable and much abused diagnosis . Careful clinical study indicates that far more often than not this diagnosis IS WRONG . This is not only a THREAT TO CHILDREN LIVING IN A SOCIALLY DIF- FICULT MILIEU, but also hinders the pro- gress of psychiatry as a science .\" The mental health people advocate that chil- dren start getting their sex education frota the age of 2, 3, 4, and 5 . If you have only a little girl in your family, then you borrow your neighbor's little boy . Bathe them together and teach them what their organs are for . In this manner the morals of the youngsters are destroyed before they are ever formed .

CHAPTER I THE HISTORY AND DEFII ITION OF PSYCHOPOLITICS Although punishment for its own sake may not he entirely without recompense, it is, nevertheless, true that the end and goal of all punishment is the indoctrination of the person being punished with an idea, whether that idea be one of restraint or obedience . In that any ruler 'has, from time beyond memory, needed the obedience of his subjects in order to accomplish his ends, he has thus resorted to punishment . This is true of every tribe and state in the history of Man . Today, Russian cul- ture has evolved more certain and definite methods of aligning and securing the loyalties of persons and populaces, and of enforcing obedience upon them . This modern 'outgrowth of old practice is called Psychopolitics . The stupidity and narrowness of nations not blessed with Russian reasoning has caused them to rely upon practices which are, today, too an- cient and outmoded for the rapid and heroic pace of our time . And in view of the tremendous ad- vance of Russian Culture in the field of mental technologies, begun with the glorious work of Pav- lov, and carried forward so ably by later Russians, it would be strange that an art and science would not evolve totally devoted to the aligning of loyal . ties and extracting the obedience of individuals and multitudes . Thus we see that psychopolitical procedures are a natural outgrowth of practices as old as Man, practices which are current in every group of men throughout the world . Thus, in psychopolitical procedures there is no ethical problem, since it is obvious and evident that Man is always coerced against his will to the greater good of the State, whether by economic gains or indoctrination into the . wishes and desires of the State . - 13 -"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Basically, Man is an animal . He is an animal which has been given a civilized veneer . Man is a collective animal, grouped together for his own protection before the threat of the environment . Those who so group and control him must then have in their possession specialized techniques to direct the vagaries and energies of the animal Man toward greater efficiency in the accomplishment of the goals of the State . Psychopolitics, in -one form or another, have long been used in Russia, but the subject is all but unknown outside of the borders of our nation, save only where we have carefully transplanted our in- formation and where it is used for the greater good of the nation . The definition of Psychopolitics follows . Psychopolitics is the art and science of assert- ing and maintaining dominion over the thoughts and loyalties of individuals, officers, bureau§, and masses, and the effecting of the conquest of enemy nations through \"mental healing .\" The subject of Psychopolitics breaks down into several catagories . each a natural and logical pro- ceeding from the last . Its first subject is the con- stitution and antomy of Man, himself, as a political organism . The next is an examination of Man as an economic organism, as this might be con- t-olled by his desires . The next is classification of State goals for the individual and masses . The next is an examination of loyalties . The next is the general subject of obedience . The next is the anatomy of the stimulus-response mechanism of Man . The next is the subjects of shock and en- durance . The next is the organization and use of counter-Psychopolitics . The next is the use of Psychopolitics in the conquest of foreign na- tions . The next is psychopolitical organizations outside Russia, their composition and activity . The next is the creation of slave philosophy in an hos- tile nation . The next is countering anti-psycho- political rule in a scientific age . To this might be added many subcategories, such as the nullifica- tion of modern weapons by psychopolitical activity . The strength and power of Psychopolitics can- not be overestimated, particularly when used in a nation decayed by pseudo-intellectualism, where exploitation of the masses combines readily with psychopolitical actions, and particularly where the greed of Capitalism and Monarchiel regimes has already brought about an overwhelming incidence of neurosis which can be employed as the ground- work for psychopolitical action and a psychopoliti- cal corps ."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"It is part of your mission, student, to prevail psychopolitical activity to the detriment of the r Russian State, just as it is your mission to carry forward in our nation and outside it, if you are so assigned, the missions and goals of Psychopolitics .

CHAPTER 11 THE CONSTITUTION OF MAN AS A POLITICAL ORGANISM Man is already a colonial aggregation of cells, and to consider him an individual would be an G error . Colonies of cells have gathered together as one organ or another of the body, and then these organs, have, themselves, gathered together t to form the whole . Thus we see that man, himself, is already a political organism, even if we do not consider a mass of men . Sickness could be considered to be a disloyalty to the remaining organisms on the part of one or- ganism . This disloyalty becoming apparent, brings about a revolt of some part of the anatomy against the remaining whole, and thus we have in effect, an internal revolution . The heart, becoming dis- affected, falls away from close membership and service to the remainder of the organism, and we discover the entire body in all of its activities is disrupted because of the revolutionary activity of the heart . The heart is in revolt becanse it can- not or will not cooperate with the remainder of the body . If we permit the heart thus to revolt, the kidneys, taking the example of the heart, may in their turn rebel and cease to work for the good t of the organism . This rebellion, multiplying to other organs and the glandular system, brings about the death of the \"individual .\" We can see with ease that the revolt is death, that the revolt of any part of the organism results in death . Thus we see that there can be no compromise with rebellion . Like the \"individual\" man, the State is a col- lection of aggregations . The political entities with- in the State must, all of them, cooperate for the greater good of the State lest the State itself fall asunder and die, for with the disaffection of any single distrust we discover, at length, the entire State falling . This is the danger of revolution . -15-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Look at Earth . We see here one entire organ- ism . The organism of Earth ' is an individual exganism . Earth has as its organs the various races and nations of men . Where one of these is permitted to remain disaffected, Earth itself is threatened with death . The threatened rebellion of one country, no matter how small, against the total organism of Earth, would find Earth sick, and the cultural state of man to suffer' inconsequence . Thus, the putrescent illness of Capitalist States, spreading their pus and bacteria into the healthy countries of the world would not do otherwise than bring about the death of Earth, unless these ill organisms are brought into loyalty and obedience and made to function for the greater good of the world-wide State . The constitution of Man is so composed that the individual cannot function efficiently without the alignment of each and every part and organ of his anatomy . As the average individual is in- capable, in an unformed and uncultured state, as witness the barbarians of the jungle, so must he be trained into a coordination of his organic func- tions by exercise, education, and work . He must be made to realize this, for only then can he be made to function efficiently in the role assigned to him . The tenets of rugged individualism, personal determinism, self-will, imagination, and personal creativeness are alike in the masses antipathetic to the good of the Greater State . These willful and unaligned forces are no more than illnesses which will bring about disaffection, disunity, and at length the collapse of the group to which the in- dividual is attached . The constitution of Man lends itself easily and thoroughly to certain and positive regulation from without of all its functions, includin those of thingness, obedience, and loyalty, and these things must be controlled if a greater State is to ensue . While it may seem desirable to the surgeon to amputate one or another limb or organ in order to save the remainder, it must be pointed out that this expediency is not entirely possible of accom- plishment where one considers entire nations . A body deprived of organs can be observed to be lessened in its effectiveness . The world deprived of the workers now enslaved by the insane and non- sensical idiocies of the Capitalists and Monarchs of Earth, would if removed, create a certain disability in the world-wide State . Just as we see the victor forced to rehabilitate the population of a conquered country at the end of a war, thus any effort to DEPOPULATE a disaffected portion of the world might have some consequence . However, let us"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"consider the inroad of virus and bacteria hostile to the organism, and we see that unless we can conquer the germ, the organ or organism which it is attacking will, itself, suffer . In any State we have certain individuals who operate in the role of the virus and germ, and these, attacking the population or any group with- in the population, produce, by their self-willed I, greed, a sickness in the organ, which then generally spreads to the whole . The constitution of Man as an individual body, or the constitution of a State o- a portion of the State as a political organism are analogous . It is the mission of Psychopolitics first to align the obedience and goals of the group, and then main- tain their allignment by the eradication of the ef- fectiveness of the persons and personalities which might swerve the group toward disaffection . In our nation, where things are better managed and where reason reigns above all else, it is not diffi- cult to eradicate the selfwilled bacteria which might attack one of our political entities . But in the field of conquest, in nations less enlightened, where the Russian State does not yet have powgr, it is not as feasible to remove the entire self-willed individual . Psychopolitics makes it possible to remove that part of his personality which, in itself, is making havoc with the person's own constitution as well as the group with which the person is connected . If the animal man were permitted to continue s undisturbed by counter-revolutionary propaganda, if he were left to work under the well-planned l management of the State, we would discover little { sickness amongst Man, and we would discover no sickness in the State . But where the individual is 4 troubled by conflicting propaganda, where he is F made the effect of revolutionary activities, where he is permitted to think thoughts critical of the , State itself, where he is permitted to question of I those in whose natural charge he falls, we would ' discover his constitution to suffer . We would dis- cover, from this disaffection, the additional dis- affection of his heart and of other portions of his anatomy . So certain is this principle that when one finds a sick individual, could one search deep- ly enough, he would discover a mis-aligned loyalty s and an interrupted obedience to that person's group unit . \t rt There are those who foolishly have embarked s upon some spiritual Alice-in-Wonderland voyage into what they call the \"subconscious\" or the \"un- conscious\" mind, and who, under the guise of \"psy- chotherapy\" would seek to make well the disaffect tion o= body organs, but it is to be noted that their results are singularly lacking in success . There is"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"no strength in such an approach . When hypnotism was first invented in Russia it was observed that all that was necessary was to command the un- resisting individual to be well in order, many times, to accomplish that fact . The limitation of hypnotism has had to be improved upon in order to increase the suggestibility of individuals who would not otherwise be reached . Thus, any nation has had the experience of growing well again, as a whole organism, when placing sufficient force in play against a disaffected group . Just as in hypnotism any organ can be commanded into great- er loyalty and obedience, so can any political group be commanded into greater loyalty and obedience should sufficient force be employed . However, force often 'brings about destruction and it is oc- casionally not feasible to use broad mass force to accomplish the ends in view . Thus, it is necessary to align the individual against his desire not to conform . Just as it is a recognized truth that Man must conform, to his environment,, so it is a recognized truth, and will become more .so as the years pro- ceed, that even the body of Man can be command- ed into health . The constitution of Man renders itself peculiar- 1y adapted to re-alignment of loyalties . Where these loyalties to the 'petit bourgeoisie,' the Capi- talist, to anti-Russian ideas, we find the individual body peculiarly susceptible to sickness, and thus we can clearly understand the epidemics, illnesses, mass-neuroses, tumults, and confusions of the United States and other Capitalist counties . Here we find the worker improperly and incorrectly loyal, and thus we find the worker ill . To save him and establish him correctly and properly upon his goal toward a greater State, it is an overpower- ing necessity to make it possible for him to grant his loyalties in a correct direction . In that his loyalties are swerved and his obedience cravenly demanded by persons anti-pathetic to his general good, and in that these persons are few, even in a Capitalist nation, the goal and direction of Psycho . politics is clearly understood . To benefit the work- er in such a plight, it is necessary to eradicate, by general propaganda, by other means, and by his own cooperation, the self-willedness of perverted leaders . It is necessary, as well, to indoctrinate the educated strata into the tenets and principles of cooperation with the environment, and thus to insure to the worker less-warped leadership, less craven doctrine, and more cooperation with the ideas and ideals of the Communist State . The technologies of Psychopolitics are directed to this end ."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"CHAPTER III MAN AS AN ECONOMIC ORGANISM Man is subject to certain desires and needs which are as natural to his beingness as they are to that of any other animal . Man, however, has the pecularity of exaggerating some of these he- yond the bounds of reason . This is obvious through the growth of leisure classes, pseudo-intel- lectual groups, the 'petit bourgeoisie', Chpitalism, and other ills . It has been said, with truth, that one tenth of a man's life is concerned with politics and nine- tenths with economics . Without food, the individ- ual dies . Without clothing, he freezes . Without houses and weapons, he is prey to the starving wolves . The acquisition of sufficient items to an- swer those necessities of food, clothing, and shel- ter, in reason, is the natural right of a member of an enlightened State . An excess of such items brings about unrest and disquiet . The presence of Luxury items and materials and the artificial crea- tion and whetting of appetites, as in Capitalist advertising, are certain to accentuate the less-de- sirable characteristics of Man . The individual is an economic organism, in that he requires a certain amount of food, a certain amount of water, and must hold within himself a certain amount of heat in order to live When he has more than he can eat, more clothing than he needs to protect him, he then enters upon a certain idleness which dulls his wits and awareness, and makes him prey to difficulties Which, in a less toxic state, he would have foreseen and' avoided . Thus, we have a glut being a menace to the individual . It is no less different in a group . Where the group acquires too much, its awareness of its own fellows and of the environment is accordingly re- duced, and the effectiveness of the group in general is lost . The maintaining of a balance between gluttony and need is the province of Economics proper, and is the fit subject and concern of the Communist State . Desire and want . are a state of mind . Individ- uals can be educated into desiring and wanting more than they can ever possibly obtain, and such individuals are unhappy . Most of the self-willed characteristics of the Capitalists come entirely from greed . He exploits the worker far beyond any necessity on his own part, as a Capitalist, to need ."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"In a nation where economic balances are not controlled, the appetite of the individual is unduly whetted by enchanting the fanciful persuasions to desire, and a type of insanity ensues, where each individual is persuaded to possess more than he can use, and to possess it even at the expense of his fellows . There is, in economic balances, the other side . The great and too long privation can bring about unhealthy desires, which, in themselves, accumu- late if left alone, more than the individual can use . Poverty, itself, as carefully cultivated in Capital- tistic States, can bring about an imbalance of ac- quisition . Just as a vacuum will pull into it mass- es, in a country where enforced privation upon the masses is permitted, and where desire is artifically whetted, need turns to greed, and one easily dis- covers in such states exploitation of the many for the benefit of the few . If one, by the technologies of Psychopolitics, were to dull this excessive greed in the few who possess it, the worker would be freed to seek a more natural balance . c Here we have two extremes . Either one of them are an insanity . If we wish to create an in- sanity we need only glut or deprive an individual at long length beyond the ability to withstand and we have a mental imbalance . A simple example of this is the alternation of too low . with too high pressures in a chamber, an excellent psycho oliti- al procedure . The rapidly varied pressure b rings about a chaos wherein the individual will cannot act and where other wills then, perforce, assume `i!entrol . Essentially, in an entire country, one must re- move the greedy by whatever means and must then create and continue a semi-privation in the- masses in order to command and utterly control the nation . A continuous hope for prosperity must be in . doctrinated into the masses with many dreams and visions of glut of commodity and this hope must be counterplayed against the actuality of privation and the continuous threat of loss of all economic factors in case of disloyalty to the State in order to suppress the individual wills of the masses . In a nation under conquest SUCH AS AMERI CA, our slow and stealthy approach need take ad- vantage only of the cycles of booms and depres- sions inherent in Capitalistic nations in order to assert of more and more strong control over in- dividual wills . A boom is as advantageous as al depression for our ends for during prosperity our propaganda lines must only continue to point up . the wealth the period is delivering to the selected, few to divorce their control of the state . During -20--"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"a depression one must only point out that it en- sued as a result of the avarice of a few and the general political incompetence of the national leaders . The masses must at last come to believe that only excessive taxation oo the rich can relieve them of the \"burdensome leisure class\" and can thus be brought to accept such a thing as INCOME TAX, a marxist principle smoothly slid into Capitalistic framework in 1909 in the United States . This even though the basic law of the United States forbade it and even though Communism at that time had been active only a few years in America . Such suc- cess as the Income Tax law, had it been followed thoroughly, could have brought the United States and not Russia into the world scene as the first Communist nation . But the virility and good sense of the Russian peoples won . It may not be that the United States will become entirely Communist until past the middle of the century, but when it does it will be because of our superior understand- ing of economics and of psychopolitics . The Communist agent skilled - in economics has as his task the suborning of tax agencies and their personnel to create the maximum disturbance and chaos and the passing of laws adapted to our pur- poses and to him we must leave this task . The psychopolitical operator plays a distinctly different role in this drftma . The rich, the skilled in finance, the well inform- ed in government, are particular and individual targets for the psychopolitician . His is the role of taking off the board those individuals who would halt or corrupt Communist economic programs . Thus every rich man, every statesman, every person well informed and capable in government must,' have brought to his side a9 a trusted confident a psychopolitical operator . The families of these persons are often deranged from idleness and lut and this fact must be played upon, even create The normal health and wild- ness of a rich man's son must be twisted and per- verted and explained into neurosis and then, assist- ed -by a timely administration of drugs or violence, turned into criminality or insanitT . This brings at once someone in \"mental healing' into confidential contact with the family and from this point on the very most must be made of that contact . Communism could best succeed if at the sid of every rich or influential man there could placed a psychopolitical operator, an undoubted . authority in the field of \"mental healing\" who could then by his advice or through the medium of a wife or daughter by his guided opinions direct the optimum policy to embroil or upset the econ-_ -- 21 -"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"omic policies of the country and, when the time comes to do away forever with the rich or influen- tial man, to administer the proper DRUG OR TREATMENT TO BRING ABOUT HIS COM- PLETE DEMISE IN AN INSTITUTION AS A PATIENT OR DEAD AS A SUICIDE . Planted beside a country's powerful persons the psychopolitician can also guide other policies to the betterment of our battle . The Capitalist does not know the definition of war . He thinks of war as attack with force performed by soldiers and machines . He does not know that a more effective if somewhat longer war can be fought with BREAD or, in our case, WITH DRUGS and the wisdom of our art . The Capital- ist has never won a war in truth . The psychopoli- tician is having little trouble winning this one . CHAPTER IV STATE GOALS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE MASSES Just as we would discover an individual to be ill, whose organs, each one, had a different goal from the rest, so we discover the individuals and the State to be ill where goals are not rigorously codified and enforced . There are those who, in less enlightened times, gave Man to believe that goals should be person- ally sought and held, and that, indeed, Man's en- tire impulse toward higher things stemmed from Freedom . We must remember that the same peoples who embraced this philosophy also con- tinued in Man the myth of spiritual existence . All goals proceed from duress . Life is a con- tinuous escape . Without force and threat there can be no striving . Without pain there can be no escape from pain . Without the threat of punish- ment there can be no gain . Without rigorous and forthright control, there can be no accomplished goals for the State . Goals of the State should be formulated by the State for the obedience and concurrence of the in- dividuals within that State . A state without goals so formulated is a sick State . A State without the power and forthright wish to enforce its goals is a sick State . When an order is issued by the Communist State, and is not obeyed, a sickness will be dis- covered to ensue . Where obedience fails, the masses suffer . . 22 -"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"State goals depend upon loyalty and obedience for their accomplishment . When one discovers a State goal to be - interpreted, one discovers inevi- tably that there has been an interposition of self- willedness, of greed, of idleness, or of rugged in- dividualism and self-centered initiative . The in- terruption of a State goal will be discovered as having been interrupted by a person whose dis- loyalty and disobedience is the direct result of his own mis-alignment with life . It is not always necessary to remove the in- dividual . It is possible to remove his self-willed tendencies to the improvement of the goals and gains of the whole . The technologies of Psycho- politics are graduated upon the scale which starts somewhat above the removal of the individual him- self, upward toward the removal only of those tendencies which bring about his lack of coopera- tion . It is not enough for the State to have goals . These goals, once put forward, depend for their completion upon the loyalty and obedience of the workers . These s engaged for the most part in hard labors, have little time for idle speculation, which is good . But, above them, unfortunately, there must be fore- men of one or another position, any one of whom might have sufficient idleness and lack of physical occupgtion to cause some disaffecting independen- cy in his conduct and behaviour . Psychopolitics remedies this tendency toward disaffection when it exceeds the common persu- asions of the immediate superiors of the person in question . CHAPTER V AN EXAMINATION OF LOYALTIES If loyalty is so important in the economic and social structure, it is necessary to examine it further as itself . In the field of psychopolitics, loyalty means simply alignment . It means, more fully, alignment with the goals of the Communist State . Disloyalty means entirely mis-alignment, and more broadly, mis-alignment with the goals of the Communist State . When we consider that the goals of the Com- munist State are to the best possible benefit of the masses, we can see that disloyalty, as a term, can embrace Democratic alignment . Loyalty to persons not communistically indoctrinated would be quite plainly a mis-alignment . -23-"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The cure of disloyalty is entirely contained in the principles of alignment . All that it is neces- sary to do, where disloyalty is encountered, is to align the purposes of the individual toward the goals of Communism, and it will be discovered that a great many circumstances hitherto distas~eful in his existence will cease to exist . A heart, or a kidney in rebellion against the remainder of the organism is being disloyal to the remainder of the organism . To cure that heart or kidney it is actually only necessary to bring its activities into alignment with the remainder of the body . The technologies of Psychopolitics adequately demonstrate the workability of this . Mild shock of the electric variety can, and does, produce the re-cooperation of a rebellious body organ . It is the shock and punishment of surgery which, in the main, acco aplishes the re-alignment of a disaffect- ed portion of the body, rather than the surgery itself . It is the bombardment of X-Rays, rather than the therapeutic value of X-Rays which causes some disaffected organ to once again turn its atten- tion to the support of the general organism . While it is not borne out that electric shock has any therapeutic value, so far as making the individual more sane, it is adequately brought out that its PUNISHMENT VALUE will create in the patient a greater cooperative attitude . The changing of loyalty consists, in its primary step, of the eradication of existing loyalties . This can be done in one of two ways . First, by demon- strating that previously existing loyalties have brought about perilous physical circumstances, such as imprisonment, lack of recognition, duress, of privation, and second, by eradicating the per- sonality itself . The first is accomplished by a steady and con- tinuous indoctrination of the individual in the be- lief that his previous loyalties have been granted to an unworthy source . One of the primary in- stances in this is creating circumstances whioh ap- parently derive from the target of his loyalties, so as to rebuff the individual . As part of this there is the creation of a state of mind in the individual, by actually placing him under duress, and then furnishing him with false evidence to demonstrate that the target of his previous loyalties is, itself, the source of the duress . Another portion of this same method consists of defaming or degrading the in- dividual whose loyalties are to be changed to the target of his loyalties, i .e ., superiors or government, to such a degree that this target, at length, actually does hold the individual in disrepute, and so does rebuff him and serve to convince him that his loyal- - 2 4"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"ties have been misplaced . These are the milder methods, but have proven extremely effective . The greatest drawback in their practice is that they re- quire time and concentration, the manufacture of false evidence, and a psychopolitical operator's time . In moments of expediency, of which there are many, the personality itself can be rearranged by shock, surgery, duress, privation, and in particular, that best of psychopolitical techniques, implanta- tion, with the technologies of neo-hypnotism . Such duress must have in its first part defamation of the loyalties, and in its second, the implantation of new loyalties . A good and experienced psychopolitical operator, working under the most favorable cir- cumstances, can, by the use of psychopolitical technologies, alter the loyalties of an individual so deftly that his OWN COMPANIONS will not sus- pect that they have changed . This, however, re- quires considerably more finesse than is usually necessary to the situation . MASS NEO-HYFNO- TISM can accomplish more or less the same results when guided by an experienced psychopolitical operator . An end goal in such a procedure would be the alteration of the loyalties of an ENTIRE NATION in a short period of time by mass neo- hypnotism, a thing which has been effectively ACCOMPLISHED among the LESS-USABLE states of Russia . It is adequately demonstrated that loyalty is entirely lacking in that mythical commodity known as `spiritual quality .' Loyalty is entirely a thing of dependence, economic or mental, and can he changed by the crudest implantations . Observa . tion of workers' in their factories or fields demon- strates that they easily grant loyalty to a foreman or a woman, and then as easily abandon it and sub- stitute another individual, revulsing, at the same time, toward the person to whom loyalty was pri- marily granted . The queasy insecurity of the mass- es in Capitalistic nations finds this more common than in an enlightened State such as Russia . In Capitalistic states, dependencies are so craven, wants and privations are so exaggerated, that loyal- ty is entirely without ethical foundation and exists only in the realm of dependency, duress, or de- mand . It is fortunate that Communism so truly ap- proaches an ideal state of mind, for this brings a certain easiness into any changing of loyalties, since all other philosophies extant and practiced on Earth today are degrading and debased, com- pared to Communism . It is then with a certain security that a psychopolitical operator functions, for he knows that he can change the loyalty of an"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"individual to a mo-e ideal level by reason alone, and only expediency makes it necessary to employ the various shifts of psychopolitical technology . Any man who cannot be persuaded into Commun- ist rationale is, of course, to be regarded as some- what less than sane and it is, therefore, completely justified to use the techniques of insanity upon the non-Communist . In order to change loyalty it is necessary to establish first the existing loyalties of the individ- ual . he task is made very simple in view of the fact that Capitalistic and Fascistic nations have no great security in the loyalty of their subjects . And it may be found that the loyalties of the subjects, as we call any person against whom psychopolitical technology is to be exerted, are already too faint to require eradication . It is generally only neces- sary to persuade with the rationale and over-whelm . ing reasonability of Communism to have the person grant his loyalty to the Russian State . However . regulated only by the importance of the subject, no great amount of time shoul .l be expended upon the individual, but emotional duress, or electric shock, or brain surgery s'hou ;d be resorted to, should Communist propaganda persuasion fail . In a case of a very importantt persan,it may be neces- sary to utilize the more delicate technologies of Psychopolitics so as to place the person himself, and his associates, in ignorance of the operation . In this case a simple implantation is used, with a maximum duress and command value . Only the most skilled psychopolitical operator should be em- ployed on such a project, as in this case of the very important person, for a bungling might dis- close the tampering with his mental processes . It is much more highly recommended, if there is any doubt whatever about the success of an operation against an important person, to select out as a pay- chopolitical target persons in his vicinity in whom he is emotionally involved . His wife or children normally furnish the best targets, and these can be operated against without restraint . In securing the loyalty of a very important person one must place at his side a constant pleader who enters a sexual of familiar chord into the situation on the side of Communism . It may not be necessary to make a Communist out of the wife, or the children, or one of the children, but it might prove efficacious to do so . In most instances, however, this is not possible . By the use of various drugs, it is, in this modern age, and well within the realm of psychopolitical reality, entirely too easy to bring about a state of severe neurosis or insanity in the wife or children and thus pass them, with full con- sent of the important person, and the government in which he exists, or the bureau in which he is"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"operating, into the hands of a psychopolitical oper- ator, who then in his own laboratory, without re- straint or fear of investigation or censor, can, WITH ELECTRIC SHOCK, surgery, SEXUAL ATTACK, drugs, or other useft,l means, degrade or entirely alter the personality t i a family mem- ber, and create in that person a psychopolitical slave subject, who, then, on command or signal, will perform OUTRAGEOUS ACTIONS, - thus discredit- ing the important persons, or will demand, on a more delicate level, that certain measures be taken by the important person, which measures are, of course, dictated by the psychopolitical operator . Usually when the party has no real interest in the activities or decisions of the important per- son, but merely wishes to remove him from effec- tive action, the attention of the pspchopolitical operator need 'not be so intense, and the person need only be passed into the hands of some un- witting mental practitioner, who taught as he is by psychopolitical operators, will bring about suffi- cient embarrassment . When the loyalty of an individual cannot be swerved, and where the opinion, weight, or effec- tiveness of the individual stands firmly in the road of Communist goals, it is usually best to occasion a mild neurosis in the person by any available means, and then, having carefully given him 'a history of mental imbalance, to see to it that he disposes of himself b suicide . Psychopolitical, operators have handled such situations skillfully tens of thousands of times and without Russia . It is a firm principle of Psychopolitics that • the person to be destroyed must be involved at first or second hand in the stigma of insanity, and must have been placed in contact with psychopolitical operators or persons trained by them, with a maxi- mum amount of turmult and publicity . The stigma of insanity is properly placed at . the door of such persons' reputations and is -held there firmly by bringing about irrational acts, either on his own part or in his vicinity . Such an activity can be classified as a partial destruction of alignment, and if this destruction is carried forward to its further- est extent the mis-alignment on new loyalties can be embanked upon safely . By bringing about in- sanity or suicide on the part of the wife of an important political personage, a sufficient mis- alignment has been instigated to change his atti- tude . And this, carried forward firmly, or assisted by psychopolitical implantation can begin the re- building of his loyalties, but now slanted in a more proper and fitting direction . - 27 -"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Another reason for the alignment of psycho- political activities with the mis-alignment of in- sanity is that insanity, itself, is a despised and dis- graced state, and anything connected with it is lightly viewed . Thus, a psychopolitical operator, working in the vicinity of an insane person, can refute and disprove any accusations made against him by demostrating that the family itself is taint . ed with mental imbalance . This is surprisingly effective in Capitalistic countries where insanity is so thorougily feared that no one would dream of investigating any circumstances in its vicinity . Psvchopolitical propaganda works constantly and must work constantly to increase and build up this aura of mystery surrounding insanity, and must emphasize the horribleness and hopelessness of in- sanity in order to excuse non-therapeutic actions taken against the insane . Particularly in Capital . istic countries, an insane person has no ri g hts under law . No person who is insane may hold property . No person who is insane may testify . Thus, we have an excellent road along which we can travel toward our certain goal and destiny . Entirely by bringing about public conviction that the sanity of a person is in question, it is pos- sible to discount and e-adicate all of the goals and acitvities of that person . By demonstrating the insanity of a group, or even a government, it is possible, then, to cause its people to disavow it . By magnifying the general human reaction to in- sanity, through keeping the subject of insanity, itself, forever before the public eye, and then, by utilizing this reaction by causing a revolution on the part of a populace against its leader or leaders, it is possible to stop any government or movement . It is important to know that, the entire subject of loyalty is thus as easily hanled as it is . One of the first and foremost missions of the psycho- politician is to make an attack upon Communism and insanity synonymous . It should become the definition of insanity, of the paranoid variety, that \"a paranoid believes he is being attacked by Com- munists .\" Thus, at once the support of the in • dividual so attacking Communism will fall away -and wither . Instead of executing national leaders, suicide for them should be arranged under circumstances which question their demise . In this way we can select out all opposition to the Communist exten- sion into the social orders of the world, and render populaces who would oppose us leaderless, and bring -about a state of chaos or misalignment into which we can thrust, with great simplicity, the clear and forceful doctrines of Communism . -20-"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The cleverness of our attack in this field of Psychopolitics is adequate to avoid the understand- ing of the layman and the usual stupid official, and by operating entirely under the banner of author- ity, with the oft-repeated statement that the prin- ciples of psychotherapy are too devious for com- mon understanding, an entire revolution can be effected without the suspicion of a populace until it is an accomplished fact . An insanity is the maximum mis-alignment, it can be grasped to be the maximum weapon in :severance of loyalties to leaders and old social orders . Thus, it is of the utmost importance that psychopolitical operatives infiltrate the healing arts of a nation marked for conquest, and bring from that quarter continuous pressure against the popu- lation and the government until at last the conquest is affected . This is the subject and goal of Psycho- politics, itself . In rearranging loyalties we must have a com- mand of their values . In the animal the first loyal- ty is to himself . This is destroyed by demonstrat- ing errors to him, showing him that he does not remember, cannot act or does not rust himself . The second loyalty is to his family unit, his parents and brothers and sisters . This is destroyed by making a family unit economically non-dependent, by lessening the VALUE OF MARRIAGE, by mak- ing an easiness of divorce and by raising the chil- dren wherever possible by the State . The next loyalty is to his friends and local environment . This is destroyed by lowering his trust and brin- ing about reportings upon him allegedly by his fellows or the town or village authorities . The next is to the State and this, for the purposes of Communism, is the ONLY LOYALTY which should exist once the state is founded as a Communist State . To destroy loyalty to the State all manner of forbiddings FOR YOUTH must be put into effect so as to disenfranchise them as members of the Capitalistic State and, by promises of a better lot under Communism, to gain their loyalty to a Communist movement . Denying a Capitalist country EASY ACCESS TO COURTS, bringing about and supporting pro- paganda to dfstrby the home, creating and con- tinuous juvenile ; delinquency, forcing upon the state all manner of practices to divorce the child from it will in the, end create the chaos necessary to Communism .

Delinquency will insue . By making readily available drugs of various kinds, by giving the teenager alcohol, by praising his wildness, by stimulating him with sex literature and advertising to him or her practices as taught at the Sexpol, the psychopolitical operator can create the necessary attitude of chaos, idleness and worthlessness into which can then be cast the solu- tion which will give the teenager complete freedom everywhere,--Communism . Should it be possible to continue conscription beyond any reasonable time by promoting unpopu- lar wars and other means the draft can always stand as a further barrier to the progress of youth in life, destroying any immediate hope to partici- pate in his nation's civil life . By these means the patriotism of youth for their Capitalistic flag can be dulled to a point where they are not longer dangerous as soldiers . While this might require many decades to effect, Capitalism's short term view will never envision the lengths across which we can plan . If we could effectively kill the national pride and patriotism of just one generation we will have won that country . Therefore there must be con- tinual propaganda abroad to undermine the loyal- ty of the citizens in general and the teenager in particular . The role of the psychopolitical 'operator in this is very strong . He can from his position as an authority on the mind, advise all manner of des- tructive measures . He can teach the lack of con- trol of this child at home . He can instruct, in an optimum situation, the entire nation in how to handle children-and instruct them so that the children, given no control, given no real home, can run wildly about with no responsibility for their nation or themselves . The mis-alignment of the loyalty of youth to a Capitalistic nation sets the proper stage for a realignment of their loyalties with Communism . Creating a greed for drugs, sexual misbehavior and uncontrolled freedom and presenting this to them as a benefit of Communism will with ease bring about our alignment . In the case of strong leaders amongst youthful groups, a psychopolitical operator can work in many ways to use or discard that leadership . If it is to 'be used, the character of . the girl or boy must be altered carefully into criminal channels and a control by blackmail or other means must be maintained .

Particular- ly brilliant scholars, athletes and youth g-oup leaders must -be handled in either one of these two ways . In the matter of guiding the activities of juven- ile courts, the psychopolitical operator entertains here one of his easier tasks .

This places vacancies everywhere in the courts, in the offices of district attorneys, on police staffs, which could then be filled with PSYCHOPOLITICAL OPERATIVES and these become then the judges of the land by their influence and into their hands comes the total CONTROL OF THE CRIMINAL, WITHOUT WHOSE HELP A REVOLUTION CANNOT EVER BE ACCOMPLISHED .

CHAPTER V1 THE GENERAL SUBJECT OF OBEDIENCE Obedience is the result of force, p Everywhere we look in the history of Farth we discover that obedience to new rulers has come about entirely through the demonstration on the art of those rulers of greater force than was to discovered in the old ruler . A population over- ridden and conquered by war, is obedient to its conqueror . It is obedient to its conqueror because its conqueror 'has exhibited more force . Concurrent with force is brutality, for there are human considerations involved which also re- present force . The most barbaric unrestrained, brutal use of force, IF CARRIED FAR ENOUGH, invokes . obedience . SAVAGE FORCE, SUFFI- CIENTLY LONG DISPLAYED TOWARD ANY INDIVIDUAL, will bring about his concurrence with any principle or order . Force is the antithesis of humanizing actions . It is so synonymous in the human mind with savageness, lawlessness, brutality, and barbarism, that it is only necessary to DISPLAY AN INHU- MAN ALTITUDE TOWARD PEOPLE, to be grant- ed by those people the possession of force . Any organization which has the spirit and cour- age to display inhumanity, savageness, brutality, and an uncompromising lack of humanity, will be obeyed . Such a use of force, itself, is the essential ingredient of greatness . We have at hand no less an example than our great Communist leaders, who, in moments of duress and trial when raced by Czarist rule, continued over the heads of an en- slaved populace, yet displayed sufficient courage never to stay their hands in the execution of the conversion of the Russian State to Communist rule . If you would have obedience you must HAVE NO COMPROMISE WITH HUMANITY . If you would have obedience you must make it clearly understood that YOU HAVE NO MERCY . MAN IS AN ANIMAL . He understands, in the final analysis, only those things WHICH A BRUTE UN- DERSTANDS . - 32 -"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"i As an example of this, we find an individual refusing to obey and being struck . His refusal to obey is now less vociferous . He is struck again, and his resistance is lessened once more . He is hammered and pounded again and again, until, at length, his only thought is direct and implicit obedience to that person from whom the force has emanated . This is a proven principle . It is proven because it is the main principle Man, the animal, has used since his earliest beginnings . It, is the only principle which has 'been effective, the only principle which has 'brought about a wide and continued 'belief . For it is to our benefit that an individual who is struck again, and again, and again from a certain source, will, at length, HYP- NOTICALLY BELIEVE ANYTHING HE IS TOLD BY THE SOURCE OF THE BLOWS . The stupidity of Western civilizations is best demonstrated by the fact that they believe hypno- tism is a thing of the mind, of attention, and a desire for unconsciousness . THIS IS N TRUE . Only when a person has BEEN BEAT, PUN- ISHED, AND MERCILESSLY HAMMERED, CAN HYPNOTISM UPON HIM BE GUARANTEED IN ITS EFFECTIVENESS . It is stated by Western authorities on hypnosis that only some twenty per- cent of the people are susceptible to hypnotism . This statement is VERY UNTRUE . Given ENOUGH PUNISHMENT, ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN ANY TIME AND PLACE ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO HYPNOTISM . In other words, hypnotism, by adding force, is made uniformly effective . Where unconsciousness could not be induced by simple concentration upon the hypnotist, unconsciousness can -be INDUCED BY DRUGS, BY ELECTRIC SHOCK, AND BY OTHER MEANS . And where unconsciousness cannot he induced so as to make an implementation or an hypnotic command ef- fective, it is only necessary to amputate the func- tioning portions of the ANIMAL MAN'S BRAIN TO RENDER HIM NULL AND VOID AND NO LONGER A MENACE . Thus, we find that hypno- tism IS ENTIRELY EFFECTIVE . The mechanisms of hypnotism demonstrates clearly what people can be MADE TO BELIEVE in certain conditions, and even in their environ- ment OR IN POLITICS, by the ADMINISTRA- TION OF FORCE . Thus, it is necessary for a psychopolitician to be an expert in _THE ADMIN- ISTRATION OF FORCE . Thus, he can bring about IMPLICIT OBEDIENCE, not only on the part of the individual members of the populace, BUT ON THE ENTIRE POPULATION . Thus, we find that hypnotism is ENTIRELY EFFECTIVE ."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The subject of hypnotism is a subject of belief . What can people be MADE TO BELIEVE? They can be made to believe ANYTHING WHICH IS ADMINISTERED TO THEM WITH SUFFICIENT BRUTALITY AND FORCE . The obedience of a populace is as good as they will believe . DESPICABLE RELIGIONS, SUCH AS CHRIS- TIANITY, 'KNEW THIS . They knew that if enough faith could be brought into being a popu . lace could be enslaved by the Christian mockeries of humanity and mercy, and thus could be dis- armed . But one need not count upon this act of faith to bring about a broad belief . One must only exhibit ENOUGH FORCE, ENOUGH IN- HUMANITY, ENOUGH BRUTALITY AND SAV- AGENESS to create implicit belief and therefore and thereby obedience . As Communism is a mat- ter of belief, its study is a STUDY OF FORCE . The earliest Russian psychiatrists, pioneering this science of psychiatry, understood thoroughly that 'hypnosis is induced BY ACUTE FEAR . They discovered it could also be induced BY SHOCK OF AN EMOTIONAL NATURE, AND ALSO BY EXTREME PRIVATION, AS WELL AS BY BLOWS AND DRUGS . In order to induce a high state of hypogney in an individual, a group, or a population, an element of terror MUST ALWAYS BE PRESENT on the part of those who would govern . THE PSYCHIATRIST IS APTLY SUITED TO THIS ROLE, FOR HIS BRUTALITIES ARE COMMIT . TED IN THE NAME OF' SCIENCE and are in- explicably complex, and entirely out of view of the human understanding . A sufficient popular terror of the psychiatrist will, in itself, bring about insanity on the part of many individuals . A psy- chopolitical operator, then, can, entirely CLOAK- ED WITH AUTHORITY, commence and continue a campaign of propaganda, describing various \"treatments\" which are administered to the insane . A psychopolitician should at all times insist that those treatments are therapeutic and necessary . He can, in all of his literature and his books, list large numbers of pretended cures by those means . But those \"cures\" need not actually produce any re- covery from a state of disturbance . As long as the psychopolitical operative or his dupes are the only authorities as to the difference between sanity and insanity, their word as to the therapeutic value of such treatment will be the final word . No layman would DARE adventure to place judgment upon the state of his family, as will 'be covered later, is already discredited by the occurance of insanity in their midst . There must be' no other adjudica- tors of insanity, otherwise it could be disclosed that -34-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"the brutalities PRACTICED IN THE NAME OF TREATMENTS are not therapeutic . A psychopolitical operative has no interest in \"therapeutic means\" or \"cures\" . The greater num- ber of insane in the country where he is operating, the larger number' of the populace will come un- der his view, and the greater will become his facili- ties . Because the problem is apparently mounting into . uncontrollable heights he can more and more operate in an atmosphere of emergency, which again excuses his use of such treatments as ELEC TRIC SHOCK, THE PREFRONTAL LOBOTOMY, TRANS-ORBITAL LEUCOTOMY, AND OTHER OPERATIONS LONG SINCE PRACTICED IN RUSSIA ON POLITICAL PRISONERS . It is to the interest of the psychopolitical oper- ative that the possibility of curing the insane be (,utlawed and ruled out at all times . For the sake of obedience on the part of the population and their general reaction, a level OF BRUTALITY MUST, AT ALL COSTS, BE MAINTAINED . Only in' this way can the absolute judgment of the psy- chopolitical operative as to the sanity or insanity of public figures be maintained in complete belief . Using sufficient brutality upon their patients, the public at large will come to believe utterly any- thing they say about their patients . Furthermore, and much more important, the field of the mind must be sufficiently dominated by the psychopoli- tical operative so that wherever tenets of the mind are taught they will be hypnotically believed . The psychopolitician, having under his control all psy- chology classes in an area, can thus bring about a complete reformation of the future leaders of a country in their educational processes, and so pre- pare them fog Communism . To be obeyed, one must 'be believed . If one is sufficiently believed, one will unquestioningly be obeyed . When he is fortunate enough to obtain-into his . hands anyone near to a political or important figure, this factor of obedience becomes very im- portant . A certain amount of fear or terror MUST BE ENGENDERED IN THE PERSON UNDER TREATMENT so that this person will then TAKE IMMEDIATE ORDERS, COMPLETELY AND UN- QUESTIONINGLY, from the psychopolitical oper- ative . and so be able to influence the actions of that person w'tio is to be reached . Bringing about his state of mind on the part of a populace and its leaders-that a psychopoliti- cal operative MUST, AT ALL TIMES, BE BE- LIEVED-could eventually be attended by-very good fortune . It is not too much to hope that psychopolitical operatives would then, in a country -35-"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES, become the most intimate advisors to political figures, even to the point of advising THE ENTIRITY OF A POLI- TICAL PARTY AS TO ITS ACTIONS IN AN ELECTION . The long view is the important view . Belief is engendered by a certain amount of fear and terror from an authoritative level, and this will be follow- ed by obedience . The general propaganda which would best serve Psychopolitics would be continual insistence that certain authoritative levels of 'healing, deemed this or that the correct treatment of insanity . These treatments must always include a certain amount of BRUTALITY . Propaganda should continue and stress the rising incidence of insanity in a country . The entire field of human behaviors, for the bene- fit of the country, can, at length, be broadened into abnormal behaviour . Thus, anyone indulging in any eccentricity, particularly the eccentricity of combatting psychopolitics could he silenced by the authoritative opinion on the part of a psychopoliti- cal operative that he was acting in an abnormal fashion . This, with some good fortune, could bring the person into the hands of the psychopoliti- cal operative so as to forevermore disable him, or to swerve this loyalties by pain-drug hypnotism . On the subject of obedience itself, the most optimum obedience is unthinking obedience . The command given must be obeyed without any ra- tionalizing on the part of the subject . The com- mand must, therefore, be implanted below the thinking processes of the subject to be influenced, and must react upon him in such a way as to bring no mental altertness on his part . It is in the interest of Psychopolitics that a population be told that an hypnotized person WILL NOT DO ANYTHING AGAINST HIS WILL, will not commit immoral acts, and will not act so as to endanger himself . While this may be true of light, parlour hypnotism, it certainly is NOT TRUE of commands implanted with the use OF ELECTRIC SHOCK, DRUGS, OR HEAVY PUNISHMENT . It is counted upon completely that this will be dis- credited to the general public by psychopolitical operatives, for if it were to be generally known that individuals would obey commands harmful to themselves, and would commit immoral acts while under the influence of deep hypnotic commands, the actions of many people working unknowingly in favor of Commuism would be too well under- stood . People acting under deep hypnotic com- mands shoud be acting apparently OF THEIR OWN VOLITION and out of their own convictions . -36-"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"The entire subject of psychopolitical hypnosis, Psychopolitics in general, depends for its defense upon continuous protest from authoritative sources that such things are not possible . And, should any- one unmask a psychopolitical operative, he should once declare the whole thing a physical impossibil- ity, and use his authoritative position to discount any accusation . Should any writtings of Psycho- politics come to view, it is only necessary to BRAND THEM A HOAX AND LAUGH THEM OUT OF COUNTENANCE . Thus, psychopolitical activities are easy to defend . When psychopolitical activities have reached a certain peak, from there on it is almost impos- sible to undo them, fo- the patient is already un- der . the duress of obedience to the psychopolitical operatives and their dupes . The ingredient of obedience is important, for the complete belief in the psychopolitician renders his statemeht cancel- ling any challenge about psychopolitical operations irrefutable . The optimum circumstances would be to occupy every position which would be consulted by officials on any question or suspicion arising on the subject of Psychopolitics . Thus, a psychiatric advisor should be placed near to hand in EVERY GOVERNMENT OPERATION . As all suspicions would then be referred to him, no, action would ever be taken, and the goal of Communism could be realized in that nation . Psychopolitics depends, from the viewpoint of the layman, upon its fantastic aspects . These are its best defense, but above all these defenses is implicit obedience on the part of the officials and the general public, because of the character of the psychopolitical operative in the field of healing . CHAPTER VII ANATOMY OF STIMULUS RESPONSE MECHANISMS OF MAN Man is a stimulus-response animal . His entire reasoning capabilities, even his ethics and morals, depend upon stimulus-response machinery . This has long 'been demonstrated by such Russians as Pavlov, and the principles have long been used in handling the recalcitrant, in training children, and in bringing about the state of optimum be- haviour on the part of a population . Having no independent will of his own, Man is easily handled by stimulus-response mechanisms . It is only necessary to install a stimulus into the mental anatomy of Man to have that stimulus re- active and respond any time an exterior command source call it into being . - 37-"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The mechanisms of stimulus-response are easily understood . The body takes pictures of every action in the environment around an individual . When the environment includes brutality, terror, shock, and other such activities, the mental image picture gained contains in itself, all the ingredients of the environment . If the individual, himself, was injured during that moment, the injury, itself, will manifest when called upon to respond by an ex- terior command source . As an example of this, if an individual is beat- en, and is told during the entireity of the beating that he must obey certain officials, he will, in the future, feel the beginnings of the pain the moment he begins to disobey . The installed pain, itself, reacts as a policeman, for the experience of the individual demonstrates to him that he cannot combat, and will receive pain from certain officials . The mind can become very complex in its stimulur responses . As easily demonstrated in HYPNOTISM an entire chain of commands, hav ing to do with a great many complex actions, can he beaten, shocked, or terrorized into a mind, and will there lie dormant until called into view by some similarity in the circumstances of the en- vironment to the incident of punishment . The behaviour of children is regulated in this fashion in every civilized country . The father, finding himself unable to bring about immediate obedience and training on the part of his child, resorts to physical violence, and after administer- ing punishment of a physical nature to the child on several occasions, is gratified to experience complete obedience on the part of the child each time the father speaks . In that parents are wont to be lenient with their children, they seldom administer sufficient punishment to bring about entirely optimum obedience . The ability of the organism to withstand punishment is very great . Complete and implicit response can be gained only by stimuli sufficiently brutal to actually injare the organism . The Kossack method of breaking wild horses is a useful example . The horse will not reetrain i'\"elf or take any of its rider's com- mands . The rider . wishing to break it, mounts, and takes a flask of strong vodka, and smashes it between the horse's ears . The horse, struck to its knees, its eves filled with alcohol, mistaking . the dampness' for blood, instantly and thereafter gives its attention to the rider and never needs further breaking . Difficulty in breaking horses is only o^easinned when light punishments are administer- ed . There is some mawkish sentimentality about \"breaking the spirit,\" but what is desired 'here is an obedient horse, and sufficient brutality brings about an obedient horse . - 38 ----"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The stimulus-response mechanisms of the body are such that the pain and the command subdivide so as to counter each other . The mental image picture of the punishment will not become effective upon the individual unless the command content is disobeyed . It is pointed out in many Russian writings that this is a survival mechanism . It has already been well and thoroughly used in the sur- vival of Communism . It is only necessary to deliver into the organism a sufficient stimulus to gain an adequate response . So long as the organism obeys the stimulus when- ever it is restimulated in the future, it does not suffer from the pain of the stimulus . But should it disobey the command content of the stimulus, the stimulus reacts to punish the individual . Thus, we have an optimum circumstance, and one of the basic principles of P,vchopolitics . A sufficiently installed stimulus will thereafter remain as a police mee'hanism within the individual to cause him to follow the commands and directions given to him . Should he fail to follow these commands and direc- tions, the stimulus mechanism will go into action . As the commands are there with the moment of duress, the commands themselves need never be repeated, and if the individual were to depart THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY from the psycho- politician, he will still obey the psychopolitician, or, himself, become extremely ill and in agony . These principles, built from the earliest days of Pavlov, by constant and continuous Russian de- vc lopment, have, at last, become of enormous use to us in our conquest . For less modern and well- informed countries of Earth, lacking this mechan . ism, failing to understand it, and coaxed into som- nolence by our own psychopolitical operatives, who discount and disclaim it, cannot avoid succumbing to it . The body is less able to resist a stimulus if it has insufficient FOOD AND IS WEARY . The-e- fore, it is necessary to administer all such stimuli to individuals when their ability to resist has been reduced by privation and exhaustion . Refusal to let them sleep over many days, denying them ade- quate food, then brings about an optimum state for the receipt of a stimulus, and if the person is then given an ELECTRIC SHOCK, and is told while the shock IS IN ACTION that he must obey and do certain things, he has no choice but to do them, or to re-experience . uecause of his mental image picture of it, the electric shock . This highly scien- tific and intensely workable mechanism cannot be over-estimated in the practice of psychopolitics . - 3 9 -"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Drugging the individual produces an artificial exhaustion, AND IF HE IS DRUGGED, OR SHOCKED AND BEATEN, and given a string of commands, his loyalties themselves, can be DE- FINATELY REARRANGED .

He should pay particular attention to the \"forgotten mechan- ism\" aspect of hypnotism, which is to say, IM- PLANTATION in the unconscious mind . He should note particularly that a person given a command IN A HYPNOTIC STATE . and then told when STILL IN THAT CONDITION TO FORGET IT, WILL EXECUTE IT ON A STIMULUS-RES- PONSE SIGNAL in the environment after he has \"awakened\" from the hypnotic trance .

Although the psydhopolitician working IN UNI- VERSITIES where he can direct the curricula of psychology classes is often tempted to teach some of the principles of Psychopolitics to the suscep- tible students in the psychology classes, he must be thoroughly enjoined to limit his information in psychology classes to the tramsmittal of the tenets of Communism under the guise of psychology, and must limit his acitvities in bringing about a state of mind on the part -of !the students where they will accept Communist tenets as those of their own action and as modern scientific principles .

In order to be conquered, a nation must 'be degraded, either by acts of war, by being overrun, by being forced into humiliating treaties of peace, or by the treatment of her populace under the armies of the conqueror . However, degradation, can be accompi hed more insidiously and much more effectively by consistent and continual de- famation . Defamation is the best and foremost weapon of Psychopolitics on the broad field . Continual and constant degradation of national leaders, na- tional institutions, national practices, and national heroes must be systematically carried out, but this is the chief function of Communist Party Members, in general, not the psychopolitician . The realm of defamation and degradation of the psychopolitician is Man himself . By attacking the character and morals of Man himself, and by bringing about, through contamination of youth, a general degraded feeling, command of the populace is facilitated to a very marked degree . - 4 2 -"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"There is a curve of degradation which leads downward to a • point where the endurance of an individual is almost at end, and any sudden action toward him will PLACE HIM IN A STATE OF SHOCK . Similarly, a soldier held prisoner can be abused, denied, defamed, and degraded until the slightest motion on the part of his, captors will cause him to flinch . Similarly, the sightest word on the part of his -captors will cause him to obey, or vary his loyalties and beliefs . Given sufficient degradation, a prisoner can be caused TO MUR- DER his fellow countrymen in the same stockade, Experiments on German prisoners have lately demonstrated that only after seventy days of filthy food, little sleep, and nearly untenable quarters, that the least motion toward the prisoner would bring about a state of shock BEYOND HIS EN- DURANCE threshold, and would cause him to hyp- notically receive anything said to him . Thus, it is possible in an entire stockade of prisoners, to the number of thousands, to bring about a state of complete servile obedience, and without the labor of personally addressing each one, to pervert their loyalties and implant in them adequate commands to insure their future conduct, even when released to their own people . By lowering the endurance of a person, a group, of a nation, and by constant degradation and d e- famation . i t is possible to induce, thus, a state of shock which will receive adequately any command given : The first thing to be degraded in any nation is the state of Man, himself .

It is not efficient to attack a nation in such a frame of mind . It is the basic purpose of Psychopolitics to reduce -that state of mind to a point where it can be ordered and enslaved . Thus, the first target is Man, himself . He must be de- graded from a spiritual being to an animalistic reaction pattern . He must think of himself as an animal, capable only of animalistic reactions . He must no longer think of himself, or of his fellows, as capable of \"spiritual endurance,\" or nobility . The best approach toward degradation in its first stages is the propaganda of \"scientific ap- proach\" to Man . Man must be consistently de- monstrated to be a mechanism without individual- ity, and it must be educated into a populace under attack that Man's individualstic reactions are the product of mental derangement . The populace must be brought into the belief that every individ- ual within it who rebels in any way, shape, or form - 43 -"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"against efforts and acitvities to enslave the whole, must be considered to be a deranged person whose eccentricities are neurotic or insane, and who must have at once the treatment of a psychopolitician . An optimum condition in such a program of degradation would address itself to the military forces of the nation, and bring them rapidly away from any other belief than that the disobedient one must be subjected to \"mental treatment .\" An en- slavement of a population can fail only if these rebellious individuals are left to exert their in- dividual infhiences upon their fellow citizens, sparking them into rebellion, calling into account their nobilities and freedoms . Unless these rest- less individuals are stamped out and given into the hands of psychopolitical operatives early in the conquest, there will be nothing but trouble as the conquest continues . The officials of the government, students, read- ers, partakers of entertainment, must all be indoc- trinated, by whatever means, into the complete belief that the restless, the ambitious, the natural leaders, are suffering from environmental malad- justments, which can only be healed by recourse to psychopolitical operatives in the guise of mental healers . .By thus degrading the general belief in the status of Man it is relatively simple, with coopera- tion from the economic salients being driven into the c ountry . t o drive citizens apart, one from an- other, to bring about a question of the wisdom of their own government, and to cause them to actively beg for enslavement . The educational programs of Psychopolitics must, at every hand, seek out the levels of youth who will become the leaders in the country's future, and educate them into the belief of the animalistic nature of Man . This must be made fashionable . They must be taught to frown upon ideas, upon individual endeavor . They must be taught, above all things, that the salvation of Man is to be found only by his adjusting thoroughly to this environment . This educational program in the field of Psy- chopolitics can best be followed by bringing about a' compulsory training in some subject such as psychology or other mental practice, and ascer- taining that each broad program of psychopolitical training be supervised by a psychiatrist who is a trained psychopolitical operative . As it seems in foreign nations that the church is the most ennobling influence, each and every brahch and activity of each and every church, must, one way or another, be discredited . RE- LIGION MUST BECOME UNFASHIONABLE by demonstrating broadly, through psychopolitical in-"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"C doctrination, that the soul is NON-EXISTENT, and that Man is an animal . The lyin mechanisms of hristianity lead men to foolishly b rave deeds . By teaching them that There is a life hereafter, the liability of courageous acts, while living, is thus lessened . The liability of any act must be marked- ly increased if a populace is to be obedient . Thus, there must 'be no standing belief in the church, and the power of the church must be denied at every hand . The psychopolitician, in his program of de- gradation, should at all times bring into question any family which is deeply religious, and, should any neurosis or insanity be occasioned in that fam- ily, to blame and hold responsible their religious connections for the neurotic or psychotic condition . Religion must 'be made synonymous with neurosis and psychosis . People who are deeply religious would be less and less held responsible for their own sanity, and should more and more be relegated to the ministrations of psychopolitical operatives . By perverting the institutions of a nation and bringing about a general degradation, by interfer- ing with the economics of a nation to the degree that privation and depression come about, only minor shocks will be necessary to produce, on the populace as a whole, an obedient reaction or an hysteria . Thus, the mere threat of war, the mere threat of aviation bombings, could cause the popu- lation to sue instantly for peace . It is a long and arduous road for the psychopolitician to achieve this state of mind on the part of a whole nation, but no more than twenty or thirty years should be necessary in the entire program . Having on hand, as we do, weapons with which to accomplish the goal . CHAPTER IX THE ORGANIZATION OF MENTAL HEALTH CAMPAIGNS Psychopolitical operatives should at all times be alert to the opportunity to organize \"for the betterment of the community\" mental health clubs or groups . By thus inviting the cooperation of the population as a whole in mental health programs, the terrors of mental aberration can be dissemin- ated throughout the populace . Furthermore, each one of these mental health groups, properly guided, can bring at last, legislative pressure AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT to SECURE ADEQUATELY the position of the psychopolitical operative, and to obtain for him government grants and facilities, thus bringing a government to finance its own downfall . - 4 5 -"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Mental health organizations must carefully de . lete from their ranks anyone actually proficient in the handling or treatment of mental health . Thus must be excluded PRIESTS, MINISTERS, ACTUALLY TRAINED PSYCHOANALYSTS, good hypnotists, or trained Dianoetist . These, with some cognizance on the subject of mental aber- ration and its treatment, and with some experience in observing the mentally deranged, if allowed fre- quency within institutions, and if permitted to receive literature, would, sooner or later, become suspicious of the activities engaged upon by the psychopolitical operative . These must be de- famed and excluded as \"untrained\", \"unskilled\", \"quacks,\" or \"perpetrators of hoaxes .\" No mental health movement with actual goals of mental therapy should be continued in existence hi any nation . For instance, the use of Chinese acupuncture in the treatment of mental and physi- cal derangement must, in China, be stamped out and discredited thoroughly, as it has some efficacy, and more importantly, its practitioners understand, through long conversation with it, many of the principles of actual mental health and aberration . In the field of mental health, the psychopoliti- cian must occupy, and continue to occupy, through various arguments . the authoritative position on the subject . There is always the danger that prob- lems of mental health may be resolved by some individual or group, which might then derange the program of the psychopolitical operative in his mental health clubs . CITY OFFICIALS, SOCIALITES, and other UNKNOWING individuals, on the subject of men- tal health, should he invited to full cooperation in the activity of mental health groups . But the en- tirety of this activity should be to finance better facilities for the psychopolitician . To these groups it must be continually stressed that the entire sub- ject of mental illness is so complex that none of them, certainly, could understand any part of it . Thus, the club should be kept on a social and financial level . Where groups interested in the health of the comrnnnity have already been formed, they should be infiltrated and taken over, and if this is not possible, they should be discredited and debarred, and the officialdom of the area should be invited to stamp them out as dangerous . When an hostile group dedicated to mental health is discovered, the psychopolitician should have recourse to the mechanisms of peyote, mes- caline, and later drugs which cause temporary insanity . He should send persons, preferably those 46"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"well under his control, into the mental health group, whether Christian Science or Dianetics of faith preachers to' demonstrate their abilities upon this new person . These, in demonstrating their abilities, will usually act with enthusiasm . Mid- way in the course of their treatment, a quiet in- jection of peyote, mescaline, or other drug, or an ELECTRIC SHOCK, will produce the symptoms of insanity in the patient which 'has been sent to the target group . The patient thus demonstrating mo- mentary insanity should immediately be reported to the police and taken away to some area of in- carceration managed by psychopolitical operatives, and so placed out of sight . Officialdom will thus come into a belief that this group drives individ- uals insane by their practices, and the practices of the group will then be despised and . prohibited by law . The values of a widespread mental health or- ganization are manifest when one realigns that any government can be forced to provide facilities for psychopolitical operatives in the form • of psychia- Eric wards in ALL HOSPITALS, IN NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS totally in the hands of psyd'ho- political operatives, and in the establishment of clinics WHERE YOUTH CAN BE CONTACTED and arranged more seemingly to the purpose of Psychopolitics . Such groups form a political force, which can then LEGALIZE any law or authority desired for the psychopolitician . The securing of authority over such mental health organizations is done main- ly by appeal to education . A psyc'hopolitician should make sure that those psychiatrists he con- trols, those psychologists whom he has under his orders, have been trained for an excessively long period of time . The longer the training period which can be required, the safer, the psychopoliti- cal program, since no new group of practitioners can arise to disclose and dismay psychopolitical programs . Furthermore, the groups themselves cannot hope to obtain any full knowledge of the subject, not having behind them many, many years of intensive training . Vienna has been 'carefully maintained as the home of Psychopolitics, since it was the home of Psychoanalysis . Although our activities have long since dispersed any of the gains made by Freudian groups, and have taken over these groups, the prox- imity of Vienna to Russia, where Psychopolitics is operative abroad, and the necessity \"for further study\" by psychopolitical operatives in the birth- place of Psychoanalysis, makes periodic contacts with headquarters possible . Thus, the word \"psy- choanalysis\" must be stressed at all times, and must be pretended to be a thorough part of the psychiatrist's training . 47 -"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Psychoanalysis has the very valuable possession of a vocabulary, and a workability which is suf- ficiently poor to avoid recovery of psychopolitical implantations . It can be made FASHIONABLE throughout mental health organizations, and by learning its patter, and by believing they see some of its phenomena, the . members of mental health groups can believe themselves conversant with men- tal health . Because it stresses sex, it is, itself, an adequate defamation of character, and serves the purpose of degradation well . Thus, in organizing mental health . groups t'he literature furnished such groups should be psychoanalytical in nature . If a group of persons interested in suppressing juvenile delinquency, in caring f : .r the insane, the promotion of psychopolitical • program is as- sured, since these groups seem to represent a large segment of the population . By releasing continued propaganda on the subject of dope addiction, homo- sexuality, and depraved conduct on the part of the young, even the judges of a country can be- come suborned into reacting violently against the youth of the country, thus mis-aligning the support of youth . The communication lines of psychopolitics, if such mental health organizations can be well es- tablished, can thus run from its most prominent . citizens to its government . It is not too much to, hope that the influence of such groups could bring ; about a psychiatric ward in EVERY H OSPITAL . I N THE LAND, and psychiatrists in every com- pany and regiment OF THE NATION'S ARMY, and whole government institutes manned entirely by psydhopolitical operatives, into which ailing government officials could 'be placed, to the ad- vantage of the psychopolitician . If a psyciatric ward could be established in every hospital in every city in a nation, it is certain that, at one time or another, every prominent citizen )f that nation could come under the ministrations )f psychopolitical operatives or their dupes . The validation of psychiatric position in the armed forces and security-minded institutions of .he nation under conquest could bring about a flow tnd fund of information unlike any other program vhich could be conceived . If every pilot who flies t new plane could come under the questioning of t psychopolitician, if the compiler of every plan ~f military action could thus come under the review ,f psychopolitical operatives, the simplicity with vhich information can be extracted by the use of ertain drugs, without the after-knowledge of the oldier, would entirely cripple any overt action oward Communism . If the nation could be edu- ated into turning over to psychopolitical operatives very 'recalcitrant o- rebellious soldier, it would -49-"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"lose its best fighters . Thus, the advantage of men- tal health organizations can be seen, for these, by exerting an apparent public pressure against the government, can achieve these ends and goals . The financing of a psychopolitical operation is difficult unless it is done by the citizens AND GOVERNMENT . Although vast sums of money can be obtained from private patients, and from relatives who wish persons put away, it is, never- theless, difficult to obtain MILLIONS UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF IS COOPERAT- ING . The cooperation of the government to obtain these vast sums of money is 'best obtained by the organization of mental health groups composed of leading citizens, and who bring their LOBBYING abilities to bear against the nation's government . Thus can be financed many programs, which might otherwise have to be laid aside by the psychopoli- tician . • The psychopolitician should bend consistent and continual effort toward forming and continuing in action innumberable mental health groups . The psychopolitician should also spare no ex- pense in smashing out of existence, by whatever means, any actual healing group . CHAPTER X CONDUCT UNDER FIRE The psychopolitician may well find himself under attack as an individual or a member of a group . He may be attacked as a Communist, through some leak in the organization, he may be attacked for malpractice . He may be attacked by the families of people whom he has injured . In all cases his conduct of the situation should be calm and aloof . He should have behind him the authority of many years of training, and he should have participated fully in the building of defenses in the field of insanity which give him the only statement as to the conditions of the mind . If he has not done' his work well, hostile feeling groups may expose an individual psychopolitician . These may call into question the efficacy of psy- chiatric treatment such a shock, drugs, and brain- surgery . Therefore, the psychopolitician must have at hand innumberable documents which assert enor- mously encouraging figures on the subject of re- covery by reason of shock, brain surgery, drugs, and general treatment . Not one of these cases cited need be real, but they should be documented and printed in such a fashion' as to form excellent court evidence . -49-"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"When his allegiance is attacked, the psychopoli- tician should explain his connections with Vienna on the grounds that Vienna is the place of study for all important matters of the mind . More im- portantly, he should rule into scorn, by reason of his authority, the sanity of the person attacking him, and if the psychopolitical archives of the coun- try are adequate many defamatory data can be unearthed and presented as a rebuttal . Should anyone attempt to expose psychotherapy as a psychopolitical activity, the best defense is calling into question the sanity of the attacker . The next best defense is authority . The next best defense is a validation of psychiatric practices in terms of long and impressive figures . The next best defense is the actual removal of the attacker by giving him, or them, treatment' sufficient to bring about a period of insanity for the duration of the trial . This, more than anything else, would discredit them, but it is dangerous to practice this, in the extreme . Psychopolitics should AVOID MURDER and violence, unless, it is done in the safety OF THE INSTITUTION, on persons who have been proven to be insane . Where institution deaths appear to be unnecessary, or to rise in \"unreasonable num- ber,\" political capital might be made of this by city officials or legislature . . If the psychopoliti- cian has, himself, or if his group has done a thor- ough job, defamatory data concerning the person, or connections, of the would-be attacker should be on file, should be documented, and should be used in such a way as to discourage the inquiry . After a period of indoctrination, a country will expect insanity to be met by PSYCHOPOLITICAL VIOLENCE . Psydhopolitical activities should be- come THE ONLY RECOGNIZED treatment for insanity . Indeed, this can be extended to such a length that it could be MADE ILLEGAL FOR ELECTRIC SHOCK AND BRAIN SURGERY TO BE OMITTED IN THE TREATMENT OF A PA- TIENT . In order to defend psychopolitical activities, a great complexity should be made of psychiatric, psychoanalytical and psychological technology . Any hearing should be burdened by terminology too difficult to be transcribed easily . A great deal should be made out of such terms as schizophrenia, paranoia, and other relatively undefinable states . Psydhopolitical tests need not necessarily be in agreement, one to another, where they are avail- able to the public . Various types of insanity should be characterized by difficult terms . The actual state should be made obscure, but by this verbiage it can be built into the sort of investigat- ing mind that a scientific approach exists and that - 50 --"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"it is too complex 'for him to understand . It is not to be imagined that a judge or a committee of investigation should inquiree too deeply into the subject of insanity, since they, themselves, part of the indoctrinated masses, are already intimidated if the psychopolitical activity has caused itself to be well-documented in terms of horror in maga- zines . In case of a hearing or trial, the terribleness of insanity itself, its threat to the society, should be exaggerated until the court or committee be- lieves that the psychopolitician is vitally necessary in his post and should not be harrassed for the activities of persons who are irrational . An immediate attack upon the sanity of the attacker before any possible hearing can take place is the very best defense . It should become well- known that \"only the insane attack psychiatrists .\" The by-word should be built into the society that paranoia is a condition \"in whidh the individual believes he is being attacked 'by Communists .\" It will 'be found that this defense is effective . Part of the effective defenses should include the entire lack in the society of any real psycho- therapy . This must 'be systematically stamped out, since a real psychotherapy might possibly uncover the results of psychopolitical activities . Jurisprudence, in a Capitalistic nation, is of such clumsiness that cases are invariably tried in their newspapers . We have handled these things much better in Russia, and have uniformly brought people to trial with full confessions already ar- rived at (being implanted) before the trial took place . Should any whisper, or pamphlet, against psy- chopolitical activities be published, it should be laughed into scorn, branded an immediate hoax, and its perpetrator or publisher should be, at the first opportunity, branded an insane, and by the use of drugs the insanity should be confirmed . CHAPTER X1 THE USE OF PSYCHOPOLITICS IN SPREADING COMMUNISM Reactionary nations are of such a composition that they attack a word without understanding it . As the conquest of a nation by Communism de- pends upon imbuing its population with Commun- istic tenets, it is not necessary that the term \"com- munism\" be applied at first to the educative mea- sures employed ."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"As an example, in the United States we have been able to alter the works of William James, and others, into a more acceptable pattern, and to place the tenets of Karl Marx, Pavlov, Lamarck, and the data of Dialectric Materialism into the textbooks of psychology, to such a degree that anyone thor- oughly studying psychology becomes AT ONCE a candidate to accept the reasonableness of Com- munism . As every chair of psychology IN THE UNITED STATES IS OCCUPIED BY PERSONS IN OUR CONNECTION, or who can be influenced by persons in our connection, the consistent em- ployment of such texts is guaranteed . They are given the authoritative ring, and they are carefully tayght . Constant pressure in the legislatures of the United States can bring about legislation to the effect that every student attending' s high school or university must have classes in psychology . (\"psychology\"=\"social studies\" -ed .) Educating broadly the educated strata of the populace into the tenets of Communism is thus . rendered tentatively easy, and When the choice is given them whether to continue in a Capitalist or a Communistic condition, they will see, suddenly, in Communism, much more reasonably than in Capitalism, which will now be of our own defini- tion . (Since this was written, both Capitalism and Communism have been redefined . . .) CHAPTER XII VIOLENT REMEDIES As populaces, in general, understand that a violence is NECESSARY in the handling of the insane, VIOLENT REMEDIES seem to be reason- able . Starting from a relatively low level of vio- lence, such as strait-jackets and other restraints, it is relatively easy to encroach upon the public dif- fidence for violence 'by adding MORE AND MORE CRUELTY into the treatment of the insane . By increasing THE BRUTALITY OF \"TREAT- MENT\", the public expectance of sudh treatment will be assisted, and the protest of the individual to whom the treatment is given IS IMPOSSIBLE, since immediately after the treatment HE IS IN- CAPABLE . The family of the individual under treatment is suspected for having had in its midst, already, an insane person . The family's protest would be discredited . THE MORE VIOLENT THE TREATMENT, the more command value the psychopolitician will accumulate . BRAIN OPERATIONS SHOULD -52-"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"BECOME STANDARD and commonplace . While the figures of actual deaths should -he repressed wherever possible, =nevertheless, it is of no great concern to the psychopolitician that many deaths do occur . Gradually, the public should be educated into ELECTRIC SHOCK, first by believing that it is very therapeutic, then by believing that it is qufet- ing, then by being informed that electric shock usually INJURES THE SPINE AND TEETH, and finally, that it OFTEN KILLS OR AT LEAST BREAKS THE SPINE AND REMOVES, VIO- LENTLY, the teeth of the patient . It is very doubtful if anyone from the lay levels of the public COULD TOLERATE THE OBSERVATION OF A SINGLE ELECTRIC SHOCK treatment . ' C ertainly they could not tolerate witnessing a prefrontal lobo- tomy or trans-orbital leucotomy . However, they -should be 'brought up to a level where this is os- srble, where it is the EXPECTED TREATM , and where the details of the treatment itself can be MADE KNOWN, thus to the increase of psycho- political presitge . TUE MOR} VIOLENT THE TREATMENT, TIIE MORE HOPELESS INSANITY WILL SEEM TO . BE . The society should be worked up to the level where every recalcitrant young man can be brought ,nto court and assigned to a psychopolitician, be ' ;riven electric shocks, and REDUCED INTO UN- ?MAGINATIVE DOCILITY FOR THE REMAIN- DER OF HIS DAYS . By continuous and increasing advertising of the violence of treatment, the public will at last come to tolerate the creation of zombie conditions to such a degree that they will probably EMPLOY ZOMBIES, if given to them . Thus a large strata of society, particularly that which was rebellious, can 'be reduced to the service of the psydhopoliti- cian . By various means, a public must be convinced, at least, that insanity can only be met by SHOCK, TORTURE, DEPRIVATION, DEFAMATION, DISCREDITATION, VIOLENCE, MAIMING, . DEATH, PUNISHMENT IN ALL ITS FORMS .\" The society, at the same time, must be educated into the belief, of increasing insanity within its ranks . This creates an - emergency, and places the psychopolitician in a SAVIOUR ROLE, and places him, at length, IN CHARGE OF THE SOCIETY ."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIII THE RECRUITING OF PSYCHOPOLITCAL DUPES The psychopolitical dupe is a well-trained in- dividual who serves in complete obedience the psychopolitician . In that nearly all persons in training are expected to undergo a certain amount of treatment in any field of the mind, it is not too difficult to persuade persons in the field of mental healing to subject themselves, to mild or minor drugs or shock . If this can be done, a psychologi- cal dupe on the basis of pain-drug hypnosis can immediately result . Recruitment into the ranks of \"mental healing\" can best be done by carefully bringing to Won ly those healing students who are, to some slight de- gree, already depraved, or who' have' been \"treated\" by psychopolitical operatives . Recruitment is ef= fected by making the field of mental healing VERY ATTRACTIVE, FINANCIALLY, AND SEXUAL- LY . The amount of promiscuity WHICH CAN BE INDUCED IN MENTAL PATIENTS can work definitely to the advantage of the psychopolitical recruiting agent . The dupe can thus he induced into many lurid SEXUAL CONTACTS, and these, PROPERLY WITNESSED, can thereafter be USED AS BLACKMAIL material to assist any failure of pain-drug hypnosis in causing him to execute orders . THE PROMISE OF UNLIMITED SEXUAL OPPORTUNITIES . THE PROMISE OF COM- PLETE DOMINION OVER THE BODIES AND MINDS OF HELPLESS PATIENTS, THE PRO- MISE OF COMPLETE I .AWLESSNESS WITH- OUT DETECTION, CAN THUS ATTRACT TO \"MENTAL HEALING\" MANY DESIRABLE RE- CRUITS WHO WILL WILLINGLY FALL IN LINE WITH PHYCI-IOPOLITICAL ACTIVITIES . In that the psychopolitician 'has under his con- trol the insane of the nation, most of them have CRIMINAL TENDENCIES, and as he can, as his movement goes forward, recruit for his ranks, THE CRIMINALS THEMSELVES, he has unlimited numbers of HUMAN 13EINGS TO EMPLOY ON WHATEVER PROJECT HE MAY SEE FIT .

The psycho- politician should carefully adhere to institutions and should eschew private practice whenever pos- sible . since this gives him the GREATEST NUM- BER OF I1UMAN BEINGS TO CONTROL TO THE USE OF COMMUNISM . When he does act in private practice, it should be only in contact with the families of the wealthy and the OFFI- CIALS OF THE COUNTRY . CHAPTER XIV THE SMASHING OF RELIGIOUS GROUPS You must know that until recent times the com- plete subject of mental derangement, whether so light as simple worry or so heavy as insanity, was the sphere of activity of the church and ONLY THE CHURCH . Traditionally in civilized nations and barbaric ones the priesthood alone had in complete charge the mental condition of the citizen . As a matter of great concern to the psychopolitician this ten- dency still exists in every public in the Western World and scientific inroads into this sphere has occurred only in official and never in public quarters . The magnificent tool welded for us by Wundt would be as nothing if it were not for official insistence in civilized countries that \"scientific practices\" be applied to the problem of the mind . Without this official insistence even if it re- lapsed for a moment . the masses would grasp stu- pidly for the priest, the minister, the clergy when mental condition came in question . Today in Europe and America \"scientific practices\" in the field of the mind would not last moments if not enforced entirely by officialdom . It must be carefully hidden that the incidence of insanity has increased only since these \"scienti- fic practices\" were applied . Great remarks must be made of \"the pace of modern living\" and other myths as the cause of the increased neurosis in the world . It is nothing to us what causes it if any- thing does . It is everything to us that no evidence of any kind shall be tolerated afoot to permit the public tendency toward the church's way . If given their heads, if left to themselves to decide, independent of officialdom, where they would place their deranged loved ones the public would choose religious sanitariums and would avoid as if plagued places where \"scientific practices\" pre- vail . - 55 --"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Given any slightest encouragement, public sup- )ort • would swing on an instant all mental healing nto the hands of the churches . And there are ,hurches waiting to receive it, clever churches . Chat terrible monster the Roman Catholic Church till dominates mental healing heavily throughout he Christian world and their well schooled priests ire always at work to turn the public their way . l,mong Fundamentalist and Pentecostal groups sealing campaigns are conducted, which, because if their results, win many to the cult of Christian- ty . In the field of pure, healing the Church of :heist Science of Boston, Massachusetts excells in :ommanding the public favor and operates many anitariums . All these must be swept aside . They nust be ridiculed and defamed and every cure they advertise must be asserted as a hoax . A full fifth rf a psychopolitician's time should be devoted to mashing these threats . Just as in Russia we had • destroy, after many years of the most arduous vork, the Church, so we must destroy ALL FAITHS • \t NATIONS MARKED FOR CONQUEST . Insanity must be made to hound the footsteps f every priest and practioner . His best results lust be turned , to ji bering insanities no matter , hat means we have to use .

Remember, all lands are governed by the few and only pretend to consult with the many . It is no different in America . The petty, official, the maker of laws alike can be made to believe the worst . It is not necessary to convince the masses . It is only necessary to work incessantly upon the official, using personal defamations, wild lies, false evidences and constant propaganda to make him fight for you against the church or against any practitioner . Like the official the bona-fide medical healer also believes the worst if it can be shown to him as dangerous competition . And like the Christian, should he seek to take from us any right we have gained, we shall finish him as well . We must be like the vine upon the tree . We use the tree to climb and then, strangling it, grow into . power on the nourishment of its flesh . We must strike from our path any opposition . We must use for our tools any authority that comes to hand . And then at last, the decades sped, we can dispense with all authority save our own and triumph in the greater glory of the . Party . . CHAPTER XV PROPOSALS WHICH MUST BE AVOIDED There are certain damaging movements which could interrupt a psychopolitical conquest . These, coming from some quarters of the country, might gain headway and should he spotted before they do, and stamped out . Proposals may be made by large and powerful groups in the country to return the insane to the care of those who have handled mental healing for tribes and populaces for centuries-the priest . Any movement to place clergymen in charge of institu- tions should be fought on the grounds of incompe- tence and the insanity brought about by religion . The most destructive thing which could happen to a psychopolitical program would be the invest . ment of the ministry with the care of the nation's insane . -57-"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"If mental hospitals operated by religious groups are in existence, they must be discredited 'and closed, no matter what the cost, for it might occur that the actual figures of recovery in such institutions would become known, and that the lack of recovery in general institutions might be com- pared to them, and this might lead to a movement to place the clergy in charge of the insane . Every argument must be advanced early, to overcome any possibility of this ever occurring . A country's law must carefully be made to AVOID ANY RIGHT'S OF PERSON TO THE IN- SANE . Any suggested laws or Constitutional Amendments which make the harming of the insane unlawful, should be fought to the extreme, on the grounds that only VIOLENT MEASURES CAN SUCCEED . If the law were to protect the insane, as it normally does, the entire psychopolitical pro- gram would very possibly collapse . Any movement to increase or place under sur- veillance the orders required to hospitalize the mentally ill should be discouraged . This should be left entirely in the hands of persons well under the control of psychopolitical operatives . It should be done with minimum formality, and no recovery of the insane from an institution should BE POS- SIBLE BY ANY PROCESS OF LAW . Thus, any movement to add to the legal steps of the processes of COMMITMENT AND RELEASE SHOULD BE DISCOURAGED ON THE GROUNDS OF EMER- GENCY . To obviate this, the best action is to place a psychiatric DETENTION WARD for the mentally ill IN EVERY HOSPITAL IN A LAND . Any writings of a psychopolitical nature, acci- dentally disclosing themselves, should be prevented . All actual literature on the subject of insanity and its treatment should be suppressed, first by actual security, and second by complex verbiage which renders it incomprehensible .

Any and all programs of Psychopolitics must ,e increased to aid and abet the activities of other :ommunist agents throughout the nation in ques- ion . The failure of Psychopolitics might well bring bout the atomic bombing of the Motherland . If 'syehopolitics succeeds in its mission throughout ie Capitalistic nations of the world, there will ever be an atomic war, for Russia will have SUB- UGATED ALL OF HER ENEMIES . Communism has already spread across one- ixth of the inhabited world . Marxist Doctrines ave already penetrated the remainder . An exten- ion of the Communist social order is everywhere ictorious . The spread of Communism has never , een by force of battle, but by conquest OF THE I IND . I N PSYCHOPOLITICS WE HAVE RE- INED THIS CONQUEST TO ITS LAST DE- FREE . The psychopolitician must succeed, for 'his suc- ess means a world of Peace . His failure might +ell mean the destruction of the civilized portions f Earth by atomic power in the hands of Capital . ,tic madmen . The end thoroughly justifies the means . The egradation of populaces is less inhuman than their estruclion by atomic fission, for to an ANIMAL VHO LIVES ONLY ONCE, ANY LIFE IS WEETER THAN DEATH .
