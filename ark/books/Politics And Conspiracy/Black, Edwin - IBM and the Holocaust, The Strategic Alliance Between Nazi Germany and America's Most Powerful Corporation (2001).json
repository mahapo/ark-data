[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"IBM and the Holocaust is the stunning story of IBM' s strategic alliance with Nazi Germany - beginning in 1933 in the first week s that Hitler came to power and continuing well into World War II. As the Third Reich embarked upon its plan of conquest and genocide, IBM and its subsidia ries helped create enabling technologies, step-by-step, from the identification and cataloging programs of the 1930s to the selections of the 1940s. Only afte r Jews were identified - a massive and complex task that Hitler wanted done im mediately - could they be targeted for efficient asset confiscation, ghettoiz ation, deportation, enslaved Iabor, and, ultimately, annihilation. It was a cros s-tabulation and organizational challenge so monumental, it called for a computer. Of course, in the 1930s no computer existed. But IBM's Hollerith punch card technology did exist . Aided by the company's custom-designed and constantly updated Hollerith sv stems, Hitler was able to automate his persecution of the Jews. Historians ha ve always been amazed at the speed and accuracy with which the Nazis were ab le to identify and locate European Jewry. Until now, the pieces of this puzzl e have never been fully assem-bled. The fact is, IBM technology was used to organize nearly everything in Germany and then Nazi Europe, from the identific ation of the Jews in censuses, registrations, and ancestral tracing prog rams to the running of railroads and organiz-ing of concentration camp sla ve labor. IBM and its German subsidiary custom-designed compl ex solutions, one by one, anticipating the Reich's needs. They did not m erely sell the machines and walk away. Instead, IBM leased these machines for h igh fees and became the sole source of the billions of punch cards Hitler n eeded. IBM and the Holocaust takes you through the careful ly crafted corporate collusion with the Third Reich, as well as the stru ctured deniability of oral agreements, undated letters, and the Geneva interme diaries—all undertaken as the newspapers blazed with accounts ot persecution and destruction. Just as compelling is the human drama of one of our century's greatest minds, IBM founder Thomas Watson, who cooperated with the Nazis for the sake of profit. Only with IBM's technologic assistance was Hitler a ble to achieve the staggering numbers of the Holocaust. Edwin Black ha s now uncovered one of the last great mysteries of Germany's war against t he Jews - how did Hitler get the names?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" What Reviewers Have Said A b o u t IBM AND THE HOLOCAUST \"An explosive new book. . . .

He was able to cut off di rect relations between IBM in the U.S. and the Germans while continuing to deal with them indirectly. He was a master of subterfuge and made a fine art of being in a pos ition to deny collaboration with the Nazis while operating through subsidiaries who were responsive to his every wish. . . .

But this one does. Because this investigation involved documents in so many countries and in so many languages, I relied on a network of researchers and trans- lators, many of them volunteers. The team consisted of Holocaust survi- vors, children of survivors, retirees, and students with no connection to the Holocaust—as well as professional researchers, dist inguished archivists and historians, and even former Nuremberg Trial investi gators. Ultimately, more than 100 people in seven countries participated, some for months at a time, many for a few weeks between jobs or during school breaks, and some for just a few hours when we neede d specific documents translated. For most, their mission was simply to s cour record groups or newspaper microfilm looking for certain key words o r topics, knowing little about the implications of what they were finding. O nce documents were located, they were copied and sent to me for review and analysis. When we discovered a lead, we would ask for follow-up resea rch on a targeted theme or name. Researchers and translators were recruited through Internet sites, uni- versity bulletin boards, Holocaust survivor organiz ations, archivists, histori- ans, translator-researcher associations, and friend s of friends of friends. Invariably, researchers were sorry to leave the pro ject because of other com- mitments, and so they generally replaced themselves with trusted friends who could carry on their work. Obviously, space does not permit me to list all tho se who helped in so 1"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"many ways. But I would like to highlight a lew. Gay lon Finklea and Mary Jo Osgood in Austin, Texas, organized a team of volunt eers to screen the New York Times from 1933 to 1945. They worked lunch per iods, evenings, and weekends in front of microfilm readers to create a unique newspaper history of the evolving business and persecution aspects of the Holocaust-era. The Texas group was joined by about a dozen researchers in several other cities. More than 1,500 hours of reviewing was required. Te rra York in Washington, D.C., monitored the team's progress, and like a tra ffic manager broadcast the continuously changing microfilm reading assignments . I personally labored in the archives of England, Is rael, Germany, and America. But I was indispensably assisted in Britai n by Jane Booth, Andy Farenden, Matt Martinson, and others. My efforts in Israel were advanced by several people, including Ariel Szczupak and Yitzha k Kerem; Kerem also worked in the archives in Paris, Washington, and Ne w York. In Germany, I was at first helped by Barbara Haas, Katrin Reiser, and others, but then for many months by Thomas Kremer. In America, I was assisted by the accomplished Holo caust author Ger- ald Schwab, former Nuremberg Trial investigator Fre d Thieberger, former Allied occupation intelligence officer Werner Miche l, business ethics profes- sor Robert Urekew, and researchers Vanessa van der Linde and Kathleen Dyer-Williams, among many others. In Holland, research depended upon two doggedly det ermined univer- sity students, Willemijn Ruberg and Martijn Kraaij. In Poland, we were helped enormously by the devoted assistance of Zbig Kanski and others. In France, Diane Goertz and several others undertook r esearch. Many translators were kind enough to help, and of c ourse always on a rush basis. In German, two of the most important we re Susan Steiner and Inge Wolfe, both of whom leapt into complex technic al papers. Aldona Szostek-Pontchek tackled Polish. Especially diligen t was the French transla- tion team, including Jackie Holland, Virginia Rinal di, and the French team leader, Terra York; when these fine people weren't translating, they were doing double duty with English language documentati on. On the Labor Day weekend before publication, four French translators in four cities worked day and night to help unmask the facts in France. A team of extraordinary researchers worked closely with me, often from 8 A.M. to midnight, as we searched through stacks o f documents seeking clues and connecting dots. There was no rest for th ese hard-working, pro- foundly idealistic people, who often scrutinized hu ndreds of documents each day as we checked and triple-checked every granule of the story. These"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"include Erica Ashton, Sally Murek and Derek Kulnis during the day. Volun- teer David Keleti, a genetic engineer, helped bolst er the nightshift and week- end efforts. Keleti in particular helped us assembl e the murky facts about IBM in Sweden and Switzerland. Susan Cooke Anastasi , our tireless copy editor, often worked the overnight shift; whatever errors we made at night, she would fix by morning. Although many labored hard, without two heroic indi viduals this book simply could not have been completed. The first is Niels Cordes, formerly of the National Archives microfilm room. Cordes is one of the most methodical, intuitive, and knowledgeable historians and archivi sts I have ever met. We worked together in archives in New York, Washington , and London, and later he did research with a team in Berlin. Cordes trans lated many pages of Ger- man documents. He never failed to display the sharp est insights into the smallest details. The second heroic figure is Kai Gloystein. Gloystei n first worked on the project in archives and libraries in Bonn, Colo gne, and Berlin, and then flew to America to help finalize the project workin g fifteen-hour days with every fine of the manuscript and thousands of footn otes. He also translated voluminous documents, contemporary newspapers, and technical journals. Gloystein's indefatigable commitment to excellence, precision eye for detail and sharp intellect cast a profound benefit across every page of the manu- script. He was a warrior for perfection. A number of leading historians and archivists besto wed great contribu- tions to my effort through their advice, searches o f their records, assistance in recruiting others, and special accommodations. T hese men and women are the stalwarts of history. In some cases, they selfl essly offered their support, talent, and insights for more than a year. In Israe l, this includes Gilad Livne at Israel State Archives who gave me full access to the Eichmann papers, and Rochelle Rubinstein at Central Zionist Archives, wh o also helped during my visit there. In Britain, John Klier from the Univer sity of London and the entire team at the Public Record Office rendered co ntinuing assistance. In France, Agnes d'Angio and Herve Vernon of the Frenc h Economic Ministry Archive were always responsive. In Holland, Erik So mers of the Institute for War Documentation assisted for many months, recruit ing interns and facili- tating research. In Germany, warm friendship and assistance was exte nded by Ulrich Soenius at Rheinisch-Westfalisches Wirtschaftsarchi v in Cologne, Peter Grupp of Politisches Archiv in Bonn, Gerhardt Hirschfeld of Stuttgart's Library of Contemporary History, Johannes Tuchel of the Memori al for German Resis-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"tance in Berlin, as well as Karola Wagner, Anette M eiburg, Siegfried Buttner, and the entire staff at Bundesarchiv in Lichterfeld e. In Poland, Jan Jagielski at Warsaw's Jewish Historical Institute and Francis zek Piper at the Auschwitz Museum both found time in their overworked schedule to locate materials. In the United States, Marek Web helped me at YIVO a rchives. Michael Nash at Hagley Museum extended scholar-in-residence privileges that were most helpful. Henry Mayer and Aaron Kornblum at the United States Holo- caust Museum made a big difference to our demanding research. At the Na- tional Archives, I was blessed to encounter a group of irreplaceable archivists and other staffers, including John Taylor (OSS), Mi lt Gustafson (State De- partment), Fred Romanski (Justice), Greg Bradsher ( Holocaust-Era Assets), Louis Holland (captured Nazi microfilms), Marie Car penti, and many others in the reading room; these men and women worked wit h me for a year. They are the precious vanguard of America's effort to pr eserve its history. All who read this book will see the influence of my pre-publication reader reviewers, each with their own broad or nich e expertise. Each read the entire manuscript and most proffered extensive marginal notes. The re- viewers included Robert Wolfe (Nazi documentation), Abraham Peck (Holo- caust history), Henry Mayer (Holocaust documentatio n), Greg Bradsher (trading with the enemy), Werner Michel (Allied int elligence and Nazi tech- nology), Fred Thieberger (Nuremberg war crimes inve stigation), Gerhard Hirschfeld (Holocaust in Holland), Erik Somers (Hol ocaust in Holland), Bob Moore (Holocaust in Holland), Esther Finder (su rvivor issues), Robert Urekew (business ethics), Bradley Kliewer (technolo gy), Shlomo Aronson (Reich security and Nazi methodology), John Klier ( Holocaust studies and Russian history), Byron Sherwin (ethics during the Holocaust), and many others in the fields of history, financial crimes, accountancy and business practices, who gave me the gift of their time and c ounsel. All readers and reviewers helped me achieve greater precision. But a special mention must go to four of the finest minds on the period: Robert Paxton (Vichy France), William Seltzer (Holocaust c ensus and statistics tech- nology), Niels Cordes (German history and Nazi docu mentation), and Erik Somers (Holland). They influenced the manuscript in profound ways, im- measurably sharpening its precision. I received telephonic assistance from Radu Ioanid ( Holocaust in Roma- nia), Henry Friedlander (sterilization and euthanas ia), and many others. Although dozens worked hard to advance my work, two eminent scholars made a towering contribution. The first is Sybil Milton, who helped initialize my research. Milton, former historian wi th the United States Holo-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"caust Museum, had crusaded for years to discover th e connections between IBM, its Holleriths, and the Holocaust. She warned me the road would not be easy. Her original guiding efforts launched me a long the correct path. Unfortunately, Sybil passed away before the project was completed. This book is a testament to the pillar of Holocaust expe rtise she has represented for decades. The other is Robert Wolfe, rightly at the very pinn acle of the world's respected experts in Holocaust and captured Nazi do cuments. Wolfe granted me his time and unparalleled expertise for over a y ear, constantly guiding me, prodding me, and assisting me in pursuit of the most complete and pre- cisely documented story possible. Wolfe is a tirele ss warrior for truth in Holocaust documentation and accountability. His leg endary reputation among the world's archivists and historians is richly des erved. His stamp on this book and my efforts is unmistakable. History also recognizes that without a small group committed to uncov- ering the truth, this book would have never been wr itten. These people made the difference: Aron Hirt-Manheimer, Arthur He rzberg, and Lawrence Schiffman, as well as Wolfe and Milton. Without the ir courage and stamina, it simply could not have been done. Assembling the facts was ironically only half the s truggle. Publishing those facts took a historic bravery and literary fe arlessness that many lacked. At the head of the line is Philip Turner, formerly of Times Books, who acquired IBM and the Holocaust for Random House. Then, for a lmost eight months, I was closely supported—hour to hour—by Crown vice pr esident and senior editor Douglas Pepper, who bonded with the text and the mission to boldly tell this unknown story to the world. During the pa st thirty years of investiga- tive reporting and publishing, I have learned to qu ickly identify the genuine pros. Pepper and the entire team at Crown, all unde r the baton of Crown editorial director Steve Ross, never shirked. Other s, such as William Adams, Whitney Cookman, and Tina Constable worked for prec ision and excellence. From the first moment, they mobilized the commitmen t and courage to place the full weight of Crown behind the project. Crown's commitment was equaled overseas by some of the most distin- guished editors and publishers of Europe and Latin America. All of them embarked upon the year-long process of chapter-by-c hapter translation. They extended their support to me as an author and collectively joined to see this book become a worldwide phenomenon. Many b ecame friends. These include Margit Ketterle and Christian Seeger of Germany's Propylaen Verlag (Econ/Ullstein/List); Abel Gerschenfeld of F rance's Editions Robert"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Laffont; Paolo Zaninoni of Italy's RCS Libri/Rizzol i; Liesbeth de Vries of Holland's Kosmos Z&K; Zbig Kanski of Poland's Graal Agency and Ewelina Osinska of Muza; Claudio Rothmuller and Paul Christ oph of Brazil's Editora Campus for the Portuguese-speaking countries, and J orge Naveiro of Argen- tina's Adantida for the Spanish-speaking countries. British publisher Little, Brown & Company UK, and its distinguished editorial director, Alan Sam- son, completed the book's global reach. My book received the attention of the world's great publishers only because of the untiring efforts of one person, my a gent, Lynne Rabinoff. Lynne's confidence in me and the project was the do minant force behind the book assuming a global scope. She fought valiandy—h our to hour—to pre- serve the quality and integrity of the final produc t. She was tireless in her efforts to bring this story to light in the most po werful fashion, and to ensure that it would reach not only the halls of academia, but readers in some fifty countries the book will appear in. These few words cannot express my respect for her as the best agent any author could ever have. As a result of Lynne's energies and faith, this book became a real ity. Although I was always surrounded by researchers and translators, craft- ing the product required the continuous and highly amplified creative assis- tance of Hans Zimmer, Jerry Goldsmith, John Barry, BT, Moby, Tangerine Dream, David Arnold, Christopher Franke, Trevor Rab in, Trevor Jones, and many others. Working virtually fifteen hours per day for a year, often never leaving my basement for days at a time, eating at my comput er screen, imposed a profound hardship on my loving family—Elizabeth, Ra chel, and my parents. They sustained, encouraged me, and mostly allowed m e to detach from daily family life into the obsessive quest for this story . I have seen many acknowledgment sections in many Ho locaust histo- ries. But one group always seems to be overlooked. Yet during my labors, they were never out of sight or out of mind. I ackn owledge the six million Jews, including my grandparents, and millions of ot her Europeans who per- ished. Their memory and the image of their punch ca rds are with me always."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"I N T R O D U C T I O N THIS BOOK WILL BE PROFOUNDLY UNCOMFORTABLE TO R EAD. IT WAS profoundly uncomfortable to write. It tells the story of IBM's conscious involvement—directly and through its subs idiaries—in the Holocaust, as well as its involvement in the Nazi w ar machine that murdered millions of others throughout Europe. Mankind barely noticed when the concept of massivel y organized infor- mation quiedy emerged to become a means of social c ontrol, a weapon of war, and a roadmap for group destruction. The uniqu e igniting event was the most fateful day of the last century, January 30, 1 933, the day Adolf Hitler came to power. Hitler and his hatred of the Jews wa s the ironic driving force behind this intellectual turning point. But his que st was gready enhanced and energized by the ingenuity and craving for prof it of a single American company and its legendary, autocratic chairman. Tha t company was Interna- tional Business Machines, and its chairman was Thom as J. Watson. Der Fuhrer's obsession with Jewish destruction was hardly original. There had been czars and tyrants before him. But for the first time in history, an anti- Semite had automation on his side. Hitler didn't do it alone. He had help. In the upside-down world of the Holocaust, dignifie d professionals were Hitler's advance troops. Police officials disr egarded their duty in favor of protecting villains and persecuting victims. Law yers perverted concepts of justice to create anti-Jewish laws. Doctors defiled the art of medicine to per- petrate ghasdy experiments and even choose who was healthy enough to be worked to death—and who could be cost-effectively s ent to the gas chamber. Scientists and engineers debased their higher calli ng to devise the instruments 7"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"and rationales of destruction. And statisticians us ed t h e i r little known bill powerful discipline to identify the victims, projec t and rationalize the bene- fits of their destruction, organize their persecuti on, and even audit the effi- ciency of genocide. Enter IBM and its overseas subs idiaries. Solipsistic and dazzled by its own swirling univers e of technical possi- bilities, IBM was self-gripped by a special amoral corporate mantra: if it can be done, it should be done. To the blind technocrat , the means were more important than the ends. The destruction of the Jew ish people became even less important because the invigorating nature of I BM's technical achieve- ment was only heightened by the fantastical profits to be made at a time when bread lines stretched across the world. So how did it work? When Hitler came to power, a central Nazi goal was to identify and destroy Germany's 600,000-member Jewish community. To Nazis, Jews were not just those who practiced Judaism, but those of Jewish blood, regardless of their assimilation, intermarriage, religious act ivity, or even conversion to Christianity. Only after Jews were identified could they be targeted for asset confiscation, ghettoization, deportation, and ultim ately extermination. To search generations of communal, church, and governm ental records all across Germany—and later throughout Europe—was a cr oss-indexing task so monumental, it called for a computer. But in 193 3, no computer existed. When the Reich needed to mount a systematic campaig n of Jewish eco- nomic disenfranchisement and later began the massiv e movement of Euro- pean Jews out of their homes and into ghettos, once again, the task was so prodigious it called for a computer. But in 1933, n o computer existed. When the Final Solution sought to efficiently trans port Jews out of European ghettos along railroad lines and into deat h camps, with timing so precise the victims were able to walk right out of the boxcar and into a wait- ing gas chamber, the coordination was so complex a task, this too called for a computer. But in 1933, no computer existed. However, another invention did exist: the IBM punch card and card sorting system—a precursor to the computer. IBM, pr imarily through its German subsidiary, made Hitler's program of Jewish destruction a techno- logic mission the company pursued with chilling suc cess. IBM Germany, using its own staff and equipment, designed, execut ed, and supplied the indispensable technologic assistance Hitler's Third Reich needed to accom- plish what had never been done before—the automatio n of human destruc- tion. More than 2,000 such multi-machine sets were dispatched throughout Germany, and thousands more throughout German-domin ated Europe.

(Photograph courtesy U nited States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington, D.C.) sorting operations were established in every major concentration camp. People were moved from place to place, systematically work ed to death, and their remains cataloged with icy automation. IBM Germany, known in those days as Deutsche Holler ith Maschinen Gesellschaft, or Dehomag, did not simply sell the R eich machines and then walk away. IBM's subsidiary, with the knowledge of its New York headquar- ters, enthusiastically custom-designed the complex devices and specialized applications as an official corporate undertaking. Dehomag's top manage- ment was comprised of openly rabid Nazis who were a rrested after the war for their Party affiliation. IBM NY always understo od—from the outset in 1933—that it was courting and doing business with t he upper echelon of the Nazi Party. The company leveraged its Nazi Party co nnections to continu- ously enhance its business relationship with Hitler 's Reich, in Germany and throughout Nazi-dominated Europe. Dehomag and other IBM subsidiaries custom-designed the applica- tions. Its technicians sent mock-ups of punch cards back and forth to Reich offices until the data columns were acceptable, muc h as any software designer would today. Punch cards could only be designed, pr inted, and purchased from one source: IBM. The machines were not sold, t hey were leased, and regularly maintained and upgraded by only one sourc e: IBM. IBM subsidiaries"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"trained the Nazi officers and their surrogates thro ughout Europe, set up branch offices and local dealerships throughout Naz i Europe stalled by a re- volving door of IBM employees, and scoured paper mi lls to produce as many as 1.5 billion punch cards a year in Germany alone. Moreover, the fragile machines were serviced on site about once per month , even when that site was in or near a concentration camp. IBM Germany's headquarters in Berlin maintained duplicates of many code books, much as a ny IBM service bureau today would maintain data backups for computers. I was haunted by a question whose answer has long e luded historians. The Germans always had the lists of Jewish names. S uddenly, a squadron of grim-faced SS would burst into a city square and po st a notice demanding those listed assemble the next day at the train sta tion for deportation to the East. But how did the Nazis get the lists? For deca des, no one has known. Few have asked. The answer: IBM Germany's census operations and sim ilar advanced people counting and registration technologies. IBM was founded in 1896 by German inventor Herman Hollerith as a census tabula ting company. Cen- sus was its business. But when IBM Germany formed i ts philosophical and technologic alliance with Nazi Germany, census and registration took on a new mission. IBM Germany invented the racial census —listing not just reli- gious affiliation, but bloodline going back generat ions. This was the Nazi data lust. Not just to count the Jews—but to identi fy them. People and asset registration was only one of the m any uses Nazi Ger- many found for high-speed data sorters. Food alloca tion was organized around databases, allowing Germany to starve the Je ws. Slave labor was identified, tracked, and managed largely through pu nch cards. Punch cards even made the trains run on time and cataloged thei r human cargo. German Railway, the Reichsbahn, Dehomag's biggest customer , dealt directly with senior management in Berlin. Dehomag maintained pun ch card installations at train depots across Germany, and eventually acro ss all Europe. How much did IBM know? Some of it IBM knew on a dai ly basis throughout the twelve-year Reich. The worst of it I BM preferred not to know—\"don't ask, don't tell\" was the order of the d ay. Yet IBM NY officials, and frequently Watson's personal representatives, H arrison Chauncey and Werner Lier, were almost constantly in Berlin or Ge neva, monitoring activi- ties, ensuring that the parent company in New York was not cut out of any of the profits or business opportunities Nazism presen ted.

I wa nt the full story under- stood in context. Skipping around in th e book will only lead to flawed and erroneous conclusions. So if you intend to skim, or rely on selected sections, please do not read the hook at a l l . Make no mistake —the Holocaust would still have occurred without IBM. To think otherwise is more than wrong. The Holocaust would have proceeded—and often did pr oceed—with simple bullets, death marches, and massacres based on pen and paper persecution, But there is reason to examine the fantastical numb ers Hitler achieved in murdering so many millions so swiftly, and identify the crucial role of auto- mation and technology. Accountability is needed. What made me demand answers to the unasked question s about IBM and the Holocaust? I confronted the reality of IBM' s involvement one day in 1993 in Washington at the United States Holocaust M useum. There, in the very first exhibit, an IBM Hollerith D-11 card sort ing machine—riddled with circuits, slots, and wires—was prominently displaye d. Clearly affixed to the machine's front panel glistened an IBM nameplate. I t has since been replaced with a smaller IBM machine because so many people c ongregated around it, creating a bottleneck. The exhibit explained little more than that IBM was responsible for organizing the census of 1933 that first identified the Jews. IBM had been tight-lipped about its involvement wit h Nazi Germany. So although 15 million people, including most major Ho locaust experts, have seen the display, and in spite of the best efforts of leading Museum his- torians, little more was understood about this prov ocative display other than the brief curator's description at the exhibit and a few pages of supportive research. I still remember staring at the machine for an hour , and the moment when I turned to my mother and father who accompani ed me to the museum that day and promised them I would discover more. My parents are Holocaust survivors, uprooted from t heir homes in Poland. My mother escaped from a boxcar en route to Treblinka, was shot, and then buried in a shallow mass grave. My father had already run away from a guarded line of Jews and discovered her leg protruding from the snow. By moonlight and by courage, these two escape es survived against the cold, the hunger, and the Reich. Standing next to me five decades later, their image within the reflection of the exhibit gl ass, shrapnel and bullet fragments permanendy embedded in their bodies, my p arents could only express confusion. But I had other questions. The Nazis had my parents ' names. How?"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"What was the connection of t h i s gleaming black, bei ge and silver machine, squatting silently in this dimly lit museu m, to the millions of Jews and other Europeans who were murdered—and murdered not just in a chaotic split-second as a casualty of war, but in a grotesque and protracted twelve-year campaign of highly organized humiliatio n, dehumanization, and then ultimately extermination. For years after that chance discovery, I was shadow ed by the realization that IBM was somehow involved in the Holocaust in t echnologic ways that had not yet been pieced together. Dots were everywh ere. The dots needed to be connected. Knowing that International Business Machines has al ways billed itself as a \"solutions\" company, I understood that IBM doe s not merely wait for governmental customers to call. IBM has amassed its fortune and reputation precisely because it generally anticipates governme ntal and corporate needs even before they develop, and then offers, designs, and delivers customized solutions—even if it must execute those technologic solutions with its own staff and equipment. IBM has done so for countless government agencies, corporate giants, and industrial associations. For years I promised myself I would one day answer the question: How many solutions did IBM provide to Nazi Germany? I k new about the initial solution: the census. Just how far did the solution s go? In 1998, I began an obsessive quest for answers. Pr oceeding without any foundation funds, organizational grants, or pub lisher dollars behind me, I began recruiting a team of researchers, interns, tr anslators, and assistants, all on my own dime. Soon a network developed throughout the United Stat es, as well as in Germany, Israel, England, Holland, Poland, and Fran ce. This network contin- ued to grow as time went on. Holocaust survivors, c hildren of survivors, retirees, and students with no connection to the Ho locaust—as well as pro- fessional researchers, distinguished archivists and historians, and even for- mer Nuremberg Trial investigators—all began a searc h for documentation. Ultimately, more than 100 people participated, some for months at a time, some for just a few hours searching obscure Polish documents for key phrases. Not knowing the story, they searched for k ey words: census, statis- tics, lists, registrations, railroads, punch cards, and a roster of other topics. When they found them, the material was copied and s ent. For many weeks, documents were flowing in at the rate of 100 per da y. Most of my team was volunteers. All of them were sw orn to secrecy. Each was shocked and saddened by the implications o f the project and in-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"tensely motivated. A few said they could not sleep well for days after learning of the connection. I was often sustained by their w ords of encouragement. Ultimately, I assembled more t h a n 20,000 pages of d ocumentation from fifty archives, library manuscript collections, mus eum files, and other reposi- tories. In the process, I accessed thousands of for merly classified State Depart- ment, OSS, or other previously restricted governmen t papers. Other obscure documents from European holdings had never been tra nslated or connected to such an inquiry. All these were organized in my own central archive mir- roring the original archival source files. We also scanned and translated more than fifty general books and memoirs, as well as co ntemporary technical and scientific journals covering punch cards and statis tics, Nazi publications, and newspapers of the era. All of this material—primary documents, journal arti- cles, newsclips, and book extracts—were cross-index ed by month. We cre- ated one manila folder for every month from 1933 to 1950. If a document referred to numerous dates, it was cross-filed in t he numerous monthly fold- ers. Then all contents of monthly folders were furt her cross-indexed into narrow topic threads, such as Warsaw Ghetto, German Census, Bulgarian Railroads, Watson in Germany, Auschwitz, and so on. Stacks of documents organized into topics were arra yed across my basement floor. As many as six people at a time bus ily shutded copies of doc- uments from one topic stack to another from morning until midnight. One document might be copied into five or six topic sta cks. A high-speed copier with a twenty-bin sorter was installed. Just moving from place to place in the basement involved hopscotching around document pile s. None of the 20,000 documents were flash cards. It w as much more complex. Examined singly, none revealed their story . Indeed, most of them were profoundly misleading as stand-alone papers. T hey only assumed their true meaning when juxtaposed with numerous other re lated documents, often from totally unrelated sources. In other word s, the documents were all puzzle pieces—the picture could not be constructed until all the fragments were put together. For example, one IBM report flee tingly referred to a \"Mr. Hendricks\" as fetching an IBM machine from Dachau. Not until I juxtaposed that document with an obscure military statistics r eport discovered at the Public Record Office in London did I learn who Sgt. Hendricks really was. Complicating the task, many of the IBM papers and n otes were un- signed or undated carbons, employing deliberate vag ueness, code words, catchphrases, or transient corporate shorthand. I h ad to learn the contempo- raneous lexicon of the company to decipher their co ntent. I would study and stare at some individual documents for months until their meaning finally"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"became clear through some other discovered document . For example, I en- countered an IBM reference to accumulating \"points. \" Eventually, I discov- ered that \"points\" referred to making sales quotas for inclusion in IBM's Hundred Percent Club. IBM maintained sales quotas f or all its subsidiaries during the Hitler era. Sometimes a key revelation did not occur until we t racked a source back three and four stages. For example, I reviewed the English version of the well-known volume Destruction of the Dutch Jews by Jacob Presser. I found nothing on my subject. I then asked my researchers in Holland to check the Dutch edition. They found a single unfootnoted refe rence to a punch card system. Only by checking Presser's original typescr ipt did we discover a mar- ginal notation that referenced a Dutch archival doc ument that led to a cas- cade of information on the Netherlands. In reviewin g the Romanian census, I commissioned the translation of a German statistici an's twenty-page memoir to discover a single sentence confirming that punch cards were used in Romania. That information was juxtaposed against an IBM letter confirming the company was moving machinery from war-torn Pola nd into Romania to aid Romanian census operations. In the truest sense, the story of IBM and the Holoc aust has been shat- tered into thousands of shards. Only by piecing the m all together did I erect a towering picture window permitting me to view what really occurred. That verified account is retold in this book. In my pursuit, I received extraordinary cooperation from every private, public, and governmental source in every country. S adly, the only refusal came from IBM itself, which rebuffed my requests fo r access to documents and interviews. I was not alone. Since WWII, the co mpany has steadfastly refused to cooperate with outside authors. Virtuall y every recent book on IBM, whether written by esteemed business historian s or ex-IBM employees, includes a reference to the company's refusal to co operate with the author in any way. Ultimately, I was able to arrange proper a ccess. Hundreds of IBM documents were placed at my disposal. I read them a ll. Behind every text footnote is a file folder with al l the hardcopy docu- mentation needed to document every sentence in this book at a moment's notice. Moreover, I assembled a team of hair-splitt ing, nitpicking, adversarial researchers and archivists to review each and every sentence, collectively ensuring that each fact and fragment of a fact was backed up with the neces- sary black and white documents. In reconstructing the facts, I was guided on every page by two principles: context and consequences. For instance, although I enjoyed access to vol-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"umes of diplomatic and intelligence information, I was careful to concentrate on what was known p u b l i c l y in the media about atroc ities and anti-Jewish conditions in Europe. For this reason, readers will notice an extraordinary reliance on articles in the New York Times. I quote the New York Times not because it was the newspaper of record in America, but because IBM execu- ti ves , including Thomas Watson, were headquartered in New York. Had they lived in Chicago, I would have quoted the Chicago T ribune. Had they lived in Cleveland, I would have quoted the Cleveland Plain Dealer. Readers will also notice that I frequendy relied up on reproducing the exact words the principals themselves used in teleg rams, letters, or telephone transcripts. Readers can judge for themselves exact ly what was said in what context. With few exceptions (see Bibliographical Note), the Holocaust litera- ture is virtually devoid of mention of the Hollerit h machines—in spite of its high profile display at the United States Holoc aust Memorial Museum. Historians should not be defensive about the absenc e of even a mention. The public documents were all there, but there are lite rally millions of frames and pages of Holocaust documents in the leading archive s of the world. Many of these materials had simply never been accessed, man y have not been avail- able, and some are based on false chronologies or a ppear to be corporate minutia. Others were well known, such as Heydrich's 1939 instruction on concentrating Jewish communities near railroad trac ks, but the repeated ref- erences to census operations were simply overlooked . More than the obscurity of the documents, such an i nvestigation would require expertise in the history of the Holocaust b efore and after the war began, the history of post-Industrial Revolution me chanization, the history of technology, and more specifically the archaic pu nch card system, as well as an understanding of Reich economics, multi-national corporations, and a grasp of financial collusion. In addition, one woul d need to juxtapose the information for numerous countries before assemblin g the complete picture. Just as important is the fact that until I examined the IBM documents, that half of the screen was totally obscured. Again, the documents do not speak by themselves, only in ensemble. I was fortunate to have an understanding of Reich economics and multi-national commerce from my earlier book, The Transfer Agreement, as well as a background in the computer industry, and years of experience as an investigative journalist specializing in corporate misconduct. I approached this project as a typical if not grandiose investiga- tion of corporate conduct with one dramatic differe nce: the conduct impacted on the lives and deaths of millions."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Gathering my pre publication expert reviewers was a process in itself. I sought not only the leading historians of the Hol ocaust, but niche experts on such topics as Vichy France, Romania, and census and persecution. But I also consulted business historians, technical speci alists, accountants, legal sources on reparations and corporate war crimes, an investigator from the original Nuremberg prosecution team, a wartime mili tary intelligence tech- nology expert, and even an ex-FBI special agent wit h expertise in financial crimes. I wanted the prismatic view of all. Changing perspective was perhaps the dominant reaso n why the rela- tionship between IBM and the Holocaust has never be en explored. When I first wrote The Transfer Agreement in 1984, no one wanted to focus on assets. Now everyone talks about the assets. The formative years for most Holocaust scholarship was before the computer age, and well b efore the Age of Infor- mation. Everyone now possesses an understanding of how technology can be utilized in the affairs of war and peace. We can no w go back and look at the same documentation in a new light. Many of us have become enraptured by the Age of Com puterization and the Age of Information. I know I have. But now I am consumed with a new awareness that, for me, as the son of Holocaust survivors, brings me to a whole new consciousness. I call it the Age of Reali zation, as we look back and examine technology's wake. Unless we understand how the Nazis acquired the names, more lists will be compiled aga inst more people. The story of IBM and the Holocaust is just a beginn ing. I could have written twenty books with the documents I uncovered , one for every country in Europe. I estimate there are 100,000 more docume nts scattered in base- ments and corporate archives around the United Stat es and Europe. Corpo- rate archivists should take note: these documents a re related to a crime and must not be moved, tampered with, or destroyed. The y must be transferred to those appropriate archival institutions that can assure immediate and undelayed access to scholars and war crimes prosecu tors so the accountabil- ity process can continue (see Major Sources). Only through exposing and examining what really occ urred can the world of technology finally adopt the well-worn mot to: Never Again.

MANY OF THE EXHAUSTED prisoners, insensate from torture and starvation, s lumped lifelessly, waiting to fade into death.

Surviving the moment was th eir quest. 1 This nightmare was Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, a s pecial Hell on Earth created by Nazi Germany. At the rear of the camp, just meters from its back fence, stood a solitary guard tower. Its cross-barred wooden frame rose some 25 feet in the air. Looking down from this commanding perch, one saw three orderly rows of wooden barracks down to the r ight. Along the left lay kitchens, workshops, storage areas, an d latrines haphaz- ardly arrayed between curved, muddy lanes. This len gth of incar- ceration all terminated several hundred meters away at the gate leading to the camp commandant's office and the SS encampment. A barbed-wire perimeter gave the camp definition even as a series of internal fences straddling patrol aisles segmented the cruel confines into six sub-camps. 2 Just below the rear watchtower, a round-topped furn ace squatted atop the mud.

A hand made metal stretcher of sorts, used to slide emacia ted corpses into the flames, was always nearby. Here was the crematorium. Not hi dden out of sight, nor obscured by structures or berms, the crematorium wa s close enough to burn the eyes of any SS guard stationed in the watchtowe r. The ominous structure and its message were visible to all as the final wa y station should fate falter— or deliver. 3 Situated between two rivers and the towns Bergen an d Belsen, the site was originally established in spring 1943 as a prisoner transit camp for 10,000 Jews who might be ransomed or traded. But in the last months of 1944 and early 1945, as Nazi death camps, including Auschwitz, were liber- ated by the Allies, Belsen became a nightmare of hu man consolidation, re- ceiving transports from other sites. By spring 1945 , more than 40,000 were imprisoned under indescribable conditions. Starved, worked to death, and randomly tortured, the death toll rose to nearly 20 ,000 just for the month of March 1945. After liberation, horrified British med ical teams were unable to save some 14,000 dying souls. Eventually bulldozers were deployed to grue- somely shovel bodies into trenches of twisted rigor mortis. 4 Just meters from the Belsen crematorium, off to the left, near the kitch- ens and the cisterns, down a muddy path, stood the block leader's house. Inmates sometimes called this place \"the lion's den .\" Within \"the lion's den\" was a room for the Arbeitsdienstfuhrer, the Labor S ervice Leader. That is where the Hollerith punch cards were processed. At first glance, they seemed like simple rectangular cards, five and a quarter i nches long, three and a quarter inches tall, divided into numbered columns with holes punched in various rows. 5 But they were much more than simple cards. Beginning in December 1944, a Dutch Jew, Rudolf Che im, was assigned to work in the Labor Service Office. Hungry and des perate to stay warm, Cheim tried every cold morning to locate a bit of e xtra food and some matches to make a fire. Kindling was stacked in the office. But no matches. For those, Cheim needed to venture into the other r oom where the SS offic- ers slouched on chairs. Invariably, they viciously punched him in the face as the price for walking near to obtain a match. But i t was worth it for Cheim. He could survive. 6 Working in the Arbeitsdienst was good. The Labor Se rvice Office held the power of life or death over prisoners, includin g him. If an inmate could work, he could live. Cheim was happy for an office assignment working with the Hollerith punch cards and their coded numbers. But as he did, he silendy"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"observed through the corner of his eye the SS men a d m i n i s t e r i n g the card sorting procedure. For five weeks he look mental no tes. 7 Quickly, Cheim learned the method. Every day, trans ports of slave la- borers were received. Prisoners were identified by descriptive Hollerith cards, each with columns and punched holes detailin g nationality, date of birth, marital status, number of children, reason f or incarceration, physical characteristics, and work skills. Sixteen coded cat egories of prisoners were listed in columns 3 and 4, depending upon the hole position: hole 3 signified homosexual, hole 9 for anti-social, hole 12 for Gyp sy. Hole 8 designated a Jew. Printouts based on the cards listed the prison ers by personal code num- ber as well. 8 Column 34 was labeled \"Reason for Departure.\" Code 2 simply meant transferred to another camp for continuing labor. N atural death was coded 3. Execution was coded 4. Suicide coded 5. The ominous code 6 designated \"special handling,\" the term commonly understood as extermination, either in a gas chamber, by hanging, or by gunshot. 9 For some two years as the trains and trucks rolled in from Belgium, France, and Holland, thousands of punch cards were examined, processed, and the information fed back to the Department of S tatistics at the SS Eco- nomics Office in Oranienburg. The numbered men and women were com- pared to a list of work needs at Bergen-Belsen and other camps. \"Never a name,\" Cheim remembers, \"only the assigned numbers. \" How many died was just a statistic to note, a detail for the machines to digest. That December 1944, some 20,000 prisoners were registered; 50 dea ths per day, on average, were recorded on punch cards. 10 Cheim learned that to discover the occupational mak e-up of a prisoner group, each inmate's individual punch card was fed into the mechanical sorter. Then the dials were adjusted to isolate cer tain professions, labor skills, age groups, or language abilities needed fo r work battalions. If prison- ers were selected for work, their names appeared on a Hollerith printout for transport to nearby sub-camps, factories, and even local farms. 11 Labor requirements were reported and then matched b y Office D II of the SS Economics Office, which administered all the camps under Gen. Oswald Pohl. Pohl, creator of the \"Extermination by Labor\" program, ar- dently argued that expeditiously gassing Jews depri ved the Reich of an im- portant resource.

Angry SS guards vowed to recapture t hem. They resented reporting the prisoner departures in column 34 of t he punch card forms as code 7—escaped. 13 He became fascinated with a young Dutch seamstress. Who was she? Her journey began in the Westerbork camp. Went to A uschwitz. She was born May 10, 1924. No name. Just a number. 53752. B ut who was 53752, Cheim wondered? Did she not have a name, only a num ber? 14 Cheim soon began to understand the truth. Hundreds of thousands of human beings were being identified, sorted, assigne d, and transported by means of the Hollerith system. Numbers and punch ca rds had dehumanized them all, he thought. Numbers and punch cards would probably kill them all. But Cheim never understood where the Hollerith syst em came from. 15 One December morning, even as the numbered man Chei m, in his tat- tered uniform, stepped quickly toward the Bergen-Be lsen Hollerith office to stay warm and to stay alive, another man, this one dressed elegantly in a fine suit and warm overcoat, stepped out of a new chauff eured car at 590 Madison Avenue in New York. He was Thomas J. Watson. His co mpany, IBM—one of the biggest in the world—custom-designed and leased the Hollerith card sorting system to the Third Reich for use at Bergen -Belsen and most of the other concentration camps. International Business M achines also serviced its machines almost monthly, and trained Nazi personnel to use the intricate sys- tems. Duplicate copies of code books were kept in I BM's offices in case field books were lost. What's more, his company was the e xclusive source for up to 1.5 billion punch cards the Reich required each yea r to run its machines. 16 Indeed, the systems were not only used in the conce ntration camps, but hundreds of them had been installed for years throu ghout the entire com- mercial, industrial, war-making, and anti-Jewish in frastructure of Nazi Ger- many and Nazi-dominated Europe. On this cold December day, Watson was unyielding. H is German sub- sidiary, Dehomag, was out of control. More lawyers would be called, more telegrams would be sent, more clever maneuvering wi th the State Depart- ment would be undertaken—not to stop Dehomag from i ts genocidal part- nership with the Third Reich, but to ensure that al l the proceeds and profits remained with IBM NY.

These men and their philosophies c ould not have been more dissimilar. Yet as history proved, they could have hardly been more compatible. It all began decades before in New York during the last gasp of the nineteenth century, at a time when America's rapid industrial growth spurred inventions to automate virtually every manual task. Swells of immigrants came to American shores to labor long days. But som e dreamed of a better way to be industrious—or at least a faster and chea per way. Contraptions, mechanizations, and patented gadgets were everywher e turning wheels, cranking cogs, and saving steps in workshops and fa ctories. The so-called Second Industrial Revolution, powered by electricit y, was in full swing. Turn- of-the-century America—a confluence of massive comm erce and clickety- clack industrial ingenuity—was a perfect moment for the birthplace of the most powerful corporation the world has ever seen: IBM. 2 IBM's technology was originally created for only on e reason: to count people as they had never been counted before, with a magical ability to iden- tify and quantify. Before long, IBM technology demo nstrated it could do more than just count people or things. It could com pute, that is, the technol- ogy could record data, process it, retrieve it, ana lyze it, and automatically answer pointed questions. Moments of mechanized bus tle could now accom- plish what would be an impossibility of paper and p encil calculation for any mortal man. Herman Hollerith invented IBM. Born in 1860, Holler ith was the son of intellectual German parents who brought their pr oud and austere German heritage with them when they settled in Buffalo, Ne w York. Herman was only seven when his father, a language teacher, died in an accident while riding a horse. His mother was left to raise five children a lone. Proud and indepen- dent, she declined to ask her financially comfortab le parents for assistance, choosing instead a life of tough, principled self-r eliance. 3 Young Hollerith moved to New York City when, at age fifteen, he enrolled in the College of the City of New York. Ex cept for spelling difficul- ties, he immediately showed a creative aptitude, an d at age nineteen gradu- ated from the Columbia School of Mines with a degre e in engineering,"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"boasting perfect 10.0 grades. In 1879, Hollerith ac cepted the invitation of his Columbia professor to become anassistant in the U.S . Census Bureau. In those days, the decennial census was l i t t l e more th an a basic head-count, devoid of information about an individual's occupat ion, education, or other traits because the computational challenge of count ing millions of Americans was simply too prodigious. As it was, the manual co unting and cross-tabula- tion process required several years before final r esults could be tallied. Because the post-Civil War populace had grown so sw iftly, perhaps doubling since the last census, experts predicted spending more than a decade to count the 1890 census; in other words, the next cen sus in 1900 would be underway before the previous one was complete. 4 Just nineteen years old, Hollerith moved to Washing ton, D.C., to join the Census bureau. Over dinner one night at the pos h Potomac Boat Club, Director of Vital Statistics, John Billings, quippe d to Hollerith, \"There ought to be a machine for doing the purely mechanical wor k of tabulating popula- tion and similar statistics.\" Inventive Hollerith b egan to think about a solu- tion. French looms, simple music boxes, and player pianos used punched holes on rolls or cards to automate rote activity. About a year later, Hollerith was struck with his idea. He saw a train conductor punch tickets in a special pattern to record physical characteristics such as height, hair color, size of nose, and clothing—a sort of \"punched photograph.\" Other conductors could read the code and then catch anyone re-using the ticket of the original passenger. 5 Hollerith's idea was a card with standardized holes , each representing a different trait: gender, nationality, occupation, a nd so forth. The card would then be fed into a \"reader.\" By virtue of easily ad justable spring mechanisms and brief electrical brush contacts sensing for the holes, the cards could be \"read\" as they raced through a mechanical feeder. T he processed cards could then be sorted into stacks based on a specified ser ies of punched holes. 6 Millions of cards could be sorted and resorted. Any desired trait could be isolated—general or specific—by simply sor ting and resorting for data-specific holes. The machines could render the portrait of an entire population—or could pick out any group within that population. Indeed, one man could be identified from among millions if enou gh holes could be punched into a card and sorted enough times. Every punch card would become an informational storehouse limited only by the number of holes. It was nothing less than a nineteenth-century bar code for human beings. 7 By 1884, a prototype was constructed. After borrowi ng a few thousand"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"dollars from a German friend, Hollerith patented an d built a production machine. Ironically, the initial test was not a cou nt of the living, but of the dead for local health departments in Maryland, New York, and New Jersey. 8 Soon, Hollerith found his system could do more than count people. It could rapidly perform the most tedious accounting f unctions for any enter- prise: from freight bills for the New York Central Railroad to actuarial and financial records for Prudential Insurance. Most im portantly, the Hollerith system not only counted, it produced analysis. The clanging contraption could calculate in a few weeks the results that a m an previously spent years correlating. Buoyed by success, Hollerith organized a trip overseas to show his electromechanical tabulator to European governm ents, including Ger- many and Italy. Everywhere Hollerith was met with a cclaim from bureau- crats, engineers, and statisticians. 9 His card sorter was more than just a clever gadget. It was a steel, spindle, and rubber-wheeled key to the Pandora's Box of unlimited information. When the U.S. Census Bureau sponsored a contest see king the best automated counting device for its 1890 census, it w as no surprise when Hollerith's design won. The judges had been studyin g it for years. Hollerith quickly manufactured his first machines. 10 After the 1890 census, Hollerith became an overnigh t tabulating hero. His statistical feat caught the attention of the ge neral scientific world and even the popular newspapers. His systems saved the Census Bureau some $5 million, or about a third of its budget. Computatio ns were completed with unprecedented speed and added a dramatic new dimens ion to the entire nature of census taking. Now an army of census take rs could posit 235 ques- tions, including queries about the languages spoken in the household, the number of children living at home and elsewhere, th e level of each family member's schooling, country of origin, and scores o f other traits. Suddenly, the government could profile its own population. 11 Since the Census Bureau only needed most of the tab ulators once every decade, and because the defensive inventor always s uspected some electri- cian or mechanic would steal his design, Hollerith decided that the systems would be leased by the government, not purchased. T his important decision to lease machines, not sell them, would dominate al l major IBM business transactions for the next century. Washington paid Hollerith about $750,000 to rent his machines for the project. Now the inven tor's challenge was to find customers for the machines in between the decennial federal censuses. Quickly, that became no challenge at all. Governmen ts and industry were"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"queuing up for the devices. Census and statistical departments in Russia, Italy, England, France, Austria, and Germany a l l su bmitted orders. Hollerith's new technology was v i r t u a l l y unrivaled. His machine s made advanced census taking possible everywhere in the world. He and he alone would control the technology because the punchers, sorters, and tabul ators were all designed to be compatible with each other—and with no other machine that might ever be produced. 12 Moreover, millions of punch cards would be needed t o capture the data. Each disposable punch card could essentially be used only one time. Hollerith had the underpinnings of a monopoly and h e had not even started the company. Most important, the whole enterprise q uickly elevated Holle- rith and his system to supranational status. 13 Governments were just cus- tomers, customers to be kept in check. In many ways , Hollerith felt that he and his technology were indeed bigger than governme nts. In many ways, he was right. With the world waiting, it was time for the enginee r to launch a corpo- ration. Ironically, Hollerith was too busy garnerin g new business to create an actual company. Moreover, still in his thirties but already set in his ways, the handlebar mustachioed and often surly Hollerith was not well suited for the task. Hollerith could dress in top hat and eleg ant walking cane when the occasion required. But he lacked patience and fines se, abhorred the commer- cialization such a company required, and continuall y suspected his customers of planning to steal his designs. Maintaining a pat ernal connection to his invention, Hollerith took everything personally. He nce, no client or contact was too important to antagonize. Grudges were savor ed long. Feuds relished. Not infrequently, his attitude toward customers was take-it-or-leave-it. Out- spoken and abrasive, he was ready to do combat with government officials whom he suspected of undermining his patent, here o r abroad. The little annoyances of life riled him just as much, such as the car that suddenly broke down, prompting an angry letter-writing campaign to the manufacturer. 14 Other than his inventions, Hollerith was said to ch erish three things: his German heritage, his privacy, and his cat Bismarck. His link to everything German was obvious to all around him. Hollerith wen t out of his way to sail to Europe on German vessels. He once justified his friendship with a colleague's wife, explaining, \"[She] is a German so I got along very well with her.\" And when colleagues thought he needed a rest, they suggested he take a long vacation in the one place he could rela x, his beloved ancestral homeland. 15 "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"For privacy, Hollerith built a tall fence around hi s home to keep out neighbors and their pets. When too many cats scaled the top to jump into the yard, the ever-inventive Hollerith strung electrica l wire along the fence, con- nected it to a battery, and then perched at his win dow puffing on a cigar. When a neighbor cat would appear threatening Bismar ck's privacy, Hollerith would depress a switch, sending an electrical jolt into the animal. 16 Hollerith's first major overseas census was organiz ed for the brutal regime of Czar Nicholas II to launch the first-ever census of an estimated 120 million Russians. Nicholas was anxious to impor t Hollerith technology. So the inventor traveled to St. Petersburg to seal the enormous contract. 17 Shortly after his return from Russia in late 1896, Hollerith finally incor- porated. He located the company office in his auste re two-story workshop- warehouse in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C., just a few minutes drive from both the White House and Census Bureau. He named his new firm with predictable plainness: the Tabulating Mac hine Company, a name that would be quickly forgotten. 18 But that same entity would eventually become IBM, one of the most recognizable commercial names of all time. SHORTLY AFTER the 1900 census, it became apparent to the federal govern- ment that it had helped Hollerith's Tabulating Mach ine Company achieve a global monopoly, one based on an invention the Cens us Bureau had—in a way—\"commissioned\" from an employee on the Bureau's own payroll, Her- man Hollerith. Moreover, the new reform-minded Dire ctor of the Census Bureau, Simeon North, uncovered numerous irregulari ties in the Bureau's contracts for punch card machines. Hollerith was go uging the federal gov- ernment. Excessive royalties, phantom machines, inc onsistent pricing for ma- chines and punch cards, restrictive use arrangement s—the gamut of vendor abuses was discovered. 19 Worse, instead of the Bureau being Hollerith's best -treated customer, Tabulating Machine Company was charging other gover nments and commer- cial clients less. North suspected that even the Ru ssian Czar was paying far less than Uncle Sam. American taxpayers, it seemed, were subsidizing the newly ascended Hollerith empire. 20 When he investigated, North was astonished to learn that his predeces- sor, William Merriam, had negotiated lucrative and sometimes inexplicable contracts with Hollerith's firm. Then, little more than a year after Merriam left the Census Bureau, Hollerith hired him as pres ident of Tabulating Machine Company. A rankled North inaugurated a bure aucratic crusade"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"against his own agency's absolute dependence on Hol lerith technology, and the questionable costs. He demanded answers. \"All t hat I desire to be satis- fied of,\" North asked of Hollerith, \"is that t h e [U .S.] government is given as fair and as liberal terms as those embodied in the company's contracts for commercial work and ... for other governments.\" 21 Hollerith didn't like being challenged. Rather than assuage his single most important customer, Hollerith launched a tempe stuous feud with North, eastigating him before Congress, and even to the man who appointed him, President Theodore Roosevelt. Tabulating Machi ne Company's technol- ogy was indispensable, thought Hollerith. He felt h e could pressure and attack the U.S. government without restraint. But t hen North fought back. Realizing that Hollerith's patents would expire in 1906, and determined to break the inventor's chokehold on the Census Bureau , North experimented with another machine, and, finally, in July 1905, h e booted the Holleriths out of the Census Bureau altogether. Tabulating Machine Company had lost its client. 22 A rival tabulator, developed by another Census Bure au technician named James Powers, would be utilized. Powers' mach ines were much faster than Hollerith devices. They enjoyed several automa ted advances over Holle- rith. and the units were vasdy less expensive. Most of all, Powers' machines would allow the Census Bureau to break the grip of the Tabulating Machine Company. 23 Despondent and unapproachable for months during the self-inflicted Census Bureau debacle, Hollerith refused to deal wi th an onslaught of addi- tional bad business news. Strategic investments por ously lost money. Several key railroad clients defected. Tabulating Machine C ompany did, however, rebound with new designs, improved technology, more commercial clients, and more foreign census contracts. But then, in 191 0, in an unbelievably arrogant maneuver, Hollerith actually tried to stop the United States from exercising its constitutionally mandated duty to co nduct the census. Claim- ing the Census Bureau was about to deploy new machi nery that in some way infringed his patents, Hollerith filed suit and som ehow convinced a federal judge in Washington, D.C., to issue a restraining o rder against the Thirteenth Census. But the courts eventually ruled against Tab ulating Machine Com- pany. Hollerith had lost big. 24 Continuing in denial, the wealthy Hollerith tinkere d with new contrap- tions and delved into unrelated diversions while hi s company floundered. His doctors insisted it was time to leave the busin ess. Frustrated stockhold- ers and management of Tabulating Machine Company we lcomed that advice"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"and encouraged Hollerith to retire. Ambivalently, H o l l e r i t h began parceling out his interests. 25 He began with Germany. In 1910, the inventor licens ed all his patents to a German adding machine salesman named Willy Hei dinger. Heidinger created the firm Deutsche Hollerith Maschinen Gesel lschaft—the German Hollerith Machine Corporation, or Dehomag for short . This firm was owned and controlled by Heidinger; only a few of his rela tives owned token shares. As a licensee of Tabulating Machine Company, Dehoma g simply leased Hollerith technology in Germany. Tabulating Machine Company received a share of Dehomag's business, plus patent royalties. Heidinger was a tradi- tional German, fiercely proud of his heritage, and dedicated to his family. Like Hollerith, Heidinger was temperamental, prone to volcanic outbursts, and always ready for corporate combat. 26 The next year, a disillusioned, embittered Hollerit h simply sold out completely. Enter Charles Flint, a rugged individua list who at the edge of the nineteenth century epitomized the affluent adventur er capitalist. One of the first Americans to own an automobile and fly an aer oplane, an avid hunter and fisherman, Flint made his millions trading in i nternational commodities. Weapons were one of those commodities and Flint did n't care whom he sold them to. 27 Flint's war profiteering knew no limits. He organiz ed a private armada to help Brazilian officials brutally suppress a rev olt by that nation's navy, thus restoring the government's authority. He licen sed the manufacture of the newly invented Wright Brothers aeroplane to Kai ser Wilhelm to help launch German military aviation and its Great War a ces. Indeed, Flint would happily sell guns and naval vessels to both sides o f a brutal war. He sold to Peru just after leaving the employ of Chile when a border skirmish between them erupted, and to enemies Japan and Russia durin g their various conflicts. 28 Of Flint it was once written, \"Had anyone called hi m a merchant of death, Flint would have wondered what the fellow ha d in mind. Such was the nature of the Western World prior to the Great War.\" 29 Flint had also perfected an infamous business modal ity, the so-called trust Trusts were the anti-competitive industrial c ombinations that often secretly devoured competition and ultimately led to a government crack- down. The famous Sherman Anti-Trust Act was created just to combat such abuses. Newspapers of the day dubbed Flint, the \"fa ther of trusts.\" The title made him at once a glamorous legend and a villain i n his era. 30 "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"In 1911, the famous industrial combine maestro, who had so deftly cre- ated cartel-like entities in the rubber and chemica l lields, now tried some- thing different. He approached key stockholders and management of four completely unrelated manufacturing firms to create one minor diversified conglomerate. The centerpiece would be Hollerith's enterprise. 31 The four lackluster firms Flint selected defied any apparent rationale for merger. International Time Recording Company ma nufactured time clocks to record worker hours. Computing Scale Comp any sold simple retail scales with pricing charts attached as well as a li ne of meat and cheese slicers. Bundy Manufacturing produced small key-actuated tim e clocks, but, more importantly, it owned prime real estate in Endicott , New York. Of the four, Hollerith's Tabulating Machine Company was simply t he largest and most dominant member of the group. 32 Hollerith agreed to the sale, offering his stock fo r about $1.21 million, plus a 10-year consulting contract at $20,000 per y ear—an enormous sum for its day. The resulting company was given a prosaic name arising from its strange combination: Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, or CTR. The new entity was partially explained by some as a synergistic combine that would bring ready cash and an international sales f orce to four seemingly viable companies stunted by limited growth potentia l or troubled economics. Rather than bigness, Flint wanted product mix that would make each of the flagging partners stronger. 33 After the sale was finalized, a seemingly detached Hollerith strolled over to his Georgetown workshop, jammed with stacke d machine parts in every corner, and declared to the workers matter-of -facdy: \"Well, I sold the business.\" Approaching the men individually, Holler ith offered one curt com- ment or another. He was gracious to Bill Barnes, wh o had lost an arm while assembling a belt mechanism. For Joe, a young shop worker, Hollerith osten- tatiously handed him a $50 bill, making quite an im pression on someone who had never seen so large a bill. 34 Hollerith withdrew as an active manager. 35 The commercial extension of his ingenuity and turbulent persona was now in t he hands of a more skilled supranational manipulator, Charles Flint. H ollerith was willing to make millions, but only on his terms. Flint wanted millions—on any terms. Moreover, Flint wanted CTR's helm to be captained b y a businessman, not a technocrat. For that, he chose one of America's up and coming business scoundrels, Thomas J. Watson."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"CARVED AMONG the densely wooded hills, winding, dus ty back roads con- nected even the remotest farm to the small villages and towns that comprised the Finger Lakes region of New York State in the 18 90s. Gray and rutted, crackling from burnt orange maple leaves in the fal l and yielding short clouds of dust in the summer beneath the hoof and w heel of Thomas J. Wat- son's bright yellow horse-drawn organ wagon, these lonely yet intriguing by- ways seemed almost magical. Pastoral vistas of fold ing green hills veined with streams lay beyond every bend and dip. But eve n more alluring was the sheer adventure of selling that awaited Watson. Bac k then, it was just pianos and sewing machines. 36 But it took all-day tenacity and unending self- confidence to travel these dirt roads just for the opportunity—not the cer- tainty, only the opportunity—to make a sale. Yet \"making the sale,\" that calculating one-on-one wizardry that ends as an exhilarating confirmation of one's mind over ano ther's motivation, this was the finesse—the power—that came naturally to Wa tson. Tall, lanky, handsome, and intelligent, he understood people. He knew when to listen and when to speak. He had mastered the art of persu asion and possessed an uncanny ability to overcome intense opposition and \"close the deal.\" All born salesmen know that the addicting excitemen t of a sales victory is short-lived. No matter how great the sale, it is never enough. Selling, for such people, becomes not an occupation, but a lifes tyle. Any salesman can sell anything. Every salesman aliv e knows these words are true. But they also know that not all sal esmen can go further. Few of them can conquer. Watson was a conqueror. From simple merchandise ina uspiciously sold to farmers and townsfolk in rural west-central New York, Watson would go on to command a global company consumed not with me re customers, but with territories, nations, and entire populations. He would identify corporate enemies to overcome and strategies to deploy. Like any conqueror, he would vanquish all in his way, and then demand the spoils . Salesmanship under Watson would elevate from one man's personal elixir to a veritable cult of commercial conquest. By virtue of his extraordinary skills, Watson would be delivered from his humble beginnings as a late-nine teenth-century horse- and-buggy back road peddler, to corporate scoundrel , to legendary tycoon, to international statesman, and finally to regal Am erican icon—all in less than four decades. Although born into a clan of tough Scottish Watsons , the future captain of industry was actually born Thomas J. \"Wasson.\" H is Protestant father, a"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"brawling, scowling lumberman of little religious to lerance, was so opposed to h a v i n g C a t h o l i c i n - l a w s in the family, he changed h is name to Wasson, just to disassociate. Eventually, the family let th e protest drop and re-adopted the Watson name. Thus, young Tom could be a genuine Watson. 37 Growing up in the Finger Lakes town of Painted Post offered few choices to the ambitious, young Watson. To escape a life of workin g the family farm and running horse teams pulling river barges, Watson de clared early he would become a teacher. He even obtained his teaching cer tificate. But after just one day on the job, the impatient Watson confessed, \"Th at settles my teaching career. I can't go into a schoolroom with a bunch o f children at nine o'clock in the morning and stay until four.\" 38 Watson wanted to dive into commerce. He began by pe ddling sewing machines and pianos on the road for a store in town . He had to provide his own horse. When his more experienced road partner d rifted away, Watson took over—and did better. Even when economic times hardened, Watson learned to find lodging with befriended farmers, ba rter goods, and push on despite rain-flooded roads and every other adversit y. Despite his admirable results, Watson's salary was generally $10 per week . Before long, he quit and looked elsewhere. 39 Quickly, Watson learned that some sales positions o ffered something called a commission, that is, a cut. He joined a bu ilding and loan association in Buffalo where he sold shares up and down the popula ted roads south of the city. Watson's deal was straight commission. His ma nager was a slick and dapper operator who taught Watson how to smoothly s ell stock in saloons, and how to always dress the role of a successful Ga y Nineties businessman. Nothing drives glibness like a commission-only job. Watson excelled—and the feeling was invigorating. He loved to sell. 40 In 1895, at age twenty-one, Watson bumped into John J. Range, the manager of the Buffalo office of one of the most ra pacious companies of the day, the National Cash Register Company. Nicknamed \"The Cash,\" NCR was the personal empire of the ruthless and belligerent tycoon, John Patterson. Patterson had created a sales manual designed to ri gidly standardize all pitches and practices, and even mold the thought pr ocesses of selling. No deviation was allowed. Patterson's way was the only way. Range was one of Patterson's most successful sales supervisors, brut alizing and humiliating his underlings until they achieved their quotas. Range became a mentor to Watson. In no time, The Cash converted Watson into a youthful commercial mercenary. 41 "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"W i t h i n m o n t h s Watson was t h e territory's leading s a l e s m a n , o u t e a r n i n g Range himself, eventually becoming among the best Cash salesmen along the East Coast. His commissions reached as hi gh as $100 per week. Patterson took notice, transferring Watson and his impressive skills to the undesirable Rochester office, one of the worst perf orming of The Cash's 160 branch offices. Watson worked his magic immediately . On his very first day, while tying his horse to the hitching post in front of the National Cash Register office, Watson encountered the angry saloonkeeper n ext door. The irate neighbor complained that The Cash enjoyed a dismal reputation and the prior sales agent was often too drunk to perform hi s job. Within minutes, Watson had somehow convinced the disenchanted man t o buy a new cash register. Watson sold a second cash register while riding out to another com- plaining prospect. 42 Patterson realized that Watson was good enough to g o beyond simple sales. He was good enough to destroy the main compe tition in Rochester, the Hallwood Company, which also marketed a cash regist er. Adopting the bru- tal, anything-goes techniques of Patterson and Rang e, and adding a few devi- ous tricks of his own, Watson began the systematic annihilation of Hallwood, its sales, and its customer base. Tactics included lurking near the Hallwood office to spy on its salesmen and customers. Watson would report the prospective clients so \"intimidation squads\" could pounce. The squads would threaten the prospect with tall tales of pate nt infringement suits by NCR against Hallwood, falsely claiming such suits w ould eventually include anyone who purchased Hallwood machines. The frighte ned customer would then be offered an NCR machine at a discount. 43 Watson never missed an opening. A Hallwood salesman whom Watson had befriended one day mentioned that he was callin g on a prospect the next day. In the morning, the Hallwood salesman arr ived at the merchant's location just as Watson's horse and buggy was ridin g off, the sale in hand. Watson had risen at dawn and driven twenty miles to steal the account. Wat- son enjoyed the triumph so thoroughly, he bragged a bout the incident for years to come. Within a few years, Watson had virtu ally driven Hallwood out of Rochester. Later, Watson bragged that he had mad e Rochester \"one of the best organized and cleanest territories.\" 44 Patterson liked Watson's style. The unscrupulous NC R president had learned to use frivolous libel and patent suits to drive his competition into submission. Watson could add a whole new dimension to the war against anyone other than Patterson who dared buy or sell c ash registers—even second-hand NCR cash registers. John Patterson beli eved that cash registers"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"were his God-granted domain and no one else's. Wats on would be the instrument of his gehemony. 45 In 1903, Watson was called to Patterson's office an d instructed to destroy second-hand dealers across the country. Alt hough he had become a star in the Rochester office, Watson was still rela tively unknown elsewhere. Patterson planted him in New York City, handed him a million-dollar budget, and asked him to create a fake business called Wats on's Cash Register and Second Hand Exchange. His mission was to join the c ommunity of second- hand dealers, learn their business, set up shop nea rby, dramatically undersell, quietly steal their accounts, intimidate their cust omers, and otherwise disrupt their viability. Watson's fake company never needed to make a profit—only spend money to decimate unsuspecting dealers of use d registers. Eventually, they would either be driven out of business or sell out to Watson with a dra- conian non-compete clause. Funneled money from NCR was used for opera- tions since Watson had no capital of his own. 46 The mission was so secretive even the NCR sales for ce in Manhattan believed that Watson had simply defected from the R ochester office to set up his own shop. He reported directly to Patterson and his staff. It took years, but the enemy—second-hand dealers—was ruthlessly co nquered. 47 The victim list was long. Fred Brainin's second-han d business was on 14th Street in Manhattan—Watson bought him out with a proviso that Brainin would stay out of cash registers. Silas Lac ey of Philadelphia merged into Watson's new front. The East Coast was easy. S o Watson moved on to a real challenge: Chicago. 48 One of the biggest Chicago dealers was Amos Thomas, located on Ran- dolph Street in the Loop, just a few steps from the Elevated. Watson's fake company moved in across the street. Thomas remember ed, \"Watson . . . tried to get me to put a price on my business. He wanted to control the second- hand business. I told him I would not sell.\" But Wa tson and his cohorts, which now included his old supervisor John Range, w ould come by three or four times each day to press the man. 49 Still, Thomas would not sell. So Watson opened a se cond competing store near Thomas. NCR had secretly acquired contro l of American Cash Register Company, the successor to Hallwood. Watson 's second front, called American Second Hand Cash Register Company, only sq ueezed Thomas fur- ther. Weakened, Thomas finally offered a buy-out pr ice of $20,000. But that was just too high for Watson. 50 By now, it was clear to Thomas that Watson was fron ting for Patterson's NCR. The Cash didn't care if Thomas knew or not. To prove it, they invited"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Thomas to NCR headquarters in Dayton, Ohio, where h e was first treated to a splendid dinner and then \"handled\" by a Patterson e xecutive. Unless Thomas sold out for a \"reasonable price,\" Thomas wa s told, NCR would rent yet another store near his and continue to undersel l until his trade was entirely wrecked. Buckling under, Thomas at last ag reed to sell for $15,875 plus $500 in cash. A battered and broken Thomas ple aded with Watson, as the new owner of his company, to be kind to a long- time devoted employee. Amos Thomas had been conquered. 51 Patterson's school for scoundrels was unparalleled in American busi- ness history. A Watson aide once testified that Pat terson would scream for merciless destruction of all competitors. \"Kill the m! . . . crush them,\" Patter- son would yell at sales conferences. The vanquished included Cuckoo, Globe, Hallwood, Metropolitan, Simplex, Toledo, Uni on, and scores of other struggling cash register companies. 52 NCR salesmen wore dark suits, the corporation innov ated a One Hun- dred Point Club for agents who met their quota, and The Cash stressed \"clean living\" as a virtue for commercial success. One day during a pep rally to the troops, Watson scrawled the word THINK on a piece o f paper. Patterson saw the note and ordered THINK signs distributed throug hout the company. Watson embraced many of Patterson's regimenting tec hniques as indispens- able doctrine for good sales. What he learned at NC R would stay with him forever. 53 NCR's war tactics were limidess. Bribes, knock-off machines at preda- tory prices, threats of litigation, and even smashe d store windows were alleged. The federal government finally stepped in. On February 22, 1912, Patterson, Watson, and several dozen other Cash exe cutives were indicted for criminal conspiracy to restrain trade and construct a monopoly. Prosecutors called the conduct the most uncivilized business be havior ever seen and likened Watson and company to \"Mexican bandits.\" 54 A year later, in 1913, all defendants were found gu ilty by an Ohio jury. Damning evidence, supplied by Watson colleagues and even Watson's own signed letters of instructions, were irrefutable. M ost of the men, including Watson, received a one-year jail sentence. Many of the convicted wept and asked for leniency. But not Watson. He declared tha t he was proud of what he had accomplished. 55 Then came the floods. The late winter and early spr ing in Dayton, Ohio, had been brutal. Excessive rainfall swamped the cit y. The Mad and Miami rivers began overflowing. In late March 1913, a tor nado tore through the area, turning Dayton into a disaster scene, with mu ch of the area under"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"water. Some 90,000 people suddenly became homeless . Communications were cut. But Watson and others at NCR cont r o l l e d one of the few telegraph lines still on high ground. 56 The Cash pounced. NCR organized an immense emergenc y relief effort. The company's assembly line was retrofitted to prod uce a flotilla of rudimen- tary rowboats—one every seven minutes. Botded water and paper cups were distributed to flood victims along with hay cots fo r sleeping. NCR facilities were converted into an infirmary. Five babies were born there in one day. From New York, Watson organized a relief train of m edical supplies, food, and more water. Where roadbed and rail switches wer e washed away, Wat- son ordered them instandy repaired. When NCR relief trains encountered irreparable tracks, just a few miles from Dayton, W atson recruited men to carry supplies in on their backs until the goods re ached Dayton—all to cheering crowds. 57 Patterson, Watson, and the other NCR men became nat ional heroes over- night. A press room was established on NCR premises . Petitions were sent to President Woodrow Wilson asking for a pardon. Consi dering public sentiment, prosecutors offered consent decrees in lieu of jail time. Most of the defendants eagerly signed. Watson, however, refused, maintaini ng he saw nothing wrong in his conduct. Eventually, Watson's attorneys succ essfully overturned the conviction on a technicality. The government declin ed to re-prosecute. 58 But then the unpredictable and maniacal Patterson r ewarded Watson's years as a loyal sales warrior by suddenly subjecti ng him to public humilia- tion in front of a company assembly. Just as Watson was speaking to a festive gathering of Cash executives, Patterson histrionica lly interrupted him to praise another salesman. Everyone recognized the si gns. Shortly thereafter, Watson was summarily fired. 59 For seventeen years, NCR had been Watson's life—the fast cars and even faster commissions, the command and control of industrial subterfuge, the sense of belonging. It was now over. Shocked, W atson simply turned his hack on his exciting lifestyle at The Cash. \"Nearly everything I know about building a business comes from Mr. Patterson,\" Wats on would admit. Now he added this vow: \"I am going out to build a business bigger than John Patter- son has.\" 60 What was bigger than National Cash Register, one of America's largest corporations? Why stop at the American shoreline? W atson contacted the one man who could take him global, Charles Flint of CTR ."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"WHEN THOMAS WATSON walked into Charles Flint's Fifth Avenue suite, the ir respective reputations surrounded th e m l i k e force f i e l d s . Watson's was na- tional. Flint's was international. Watson had manip ulated mere men. Flint had catered to the destiny of nations. Yet, the two did not instandy bond. Flint was shorter and much older than Watson, altho ugh filled with just as much energy. After all, Flint had soared amongst the clouds in a Wright Brothers plane and driven automobiles, sailed the f astest boat on many a river or lake, and seen the world—all while Watson was still traversing back roads on horseback. Yet, during their first meeting , Watson was almost disap- pointed in the legendary financier's presence. But it was Flint's ideas that spoke louder than his physical stature. 61 As a nineteenth-century international economic adve nturer, Flint be- lieved that the accretion of money was its own nurt uring reward, and that the business world functioned much as the animal ki ngdom: survival of the fittest. Watson found nothing unacceptable in Flint 's philosophy. Heading up CTR could be the chance Watson knew he deserved to be his own boss and make all the decisions. CTR's diverse line was bett er than cash registers because the dominant product was Hollerith's tabula tor and card sorter. The two men could work together to make CTR great—that is, if Watson's man- agement deal was structured right. 62 But from Flint's point of view, he was hardly ready to stroll across the street to CTR's headquarters and install Watson. Th e supersalesman before him still walked under the shadow of a criminal con viction, which at that point had not yet been overturned. Although under a ppeal, it could cast the company in a bad light. During one of several board meetings to consider hiring Watson, at least one CTR director bellowed a t Flint, \"What are you trying to do? Ruin this business? Who is going to r un this business while he serves his term in jail?\" 63 It was a process, one that Watson was determined to win, and so he spoke frankly to the reluctant directors. First, he sold himself—like any adroit salesman—and then worked around their collec tive worries about his conspiracy conviction. Visions of products and prof its proliferating world- wide, million-dollar growth projections, ever-incre asing dividends—these were the rewards the directors embraced as most imp ortant. CTR bought in. Watson was offered \"a gendeman's salary\" of $25,000 per year, plus more than 1,200 shares of the firm. But Watson wanted be tter. He wanted a slice of the profits. His commissionable days at NCR had whe tted his craving for more of the same. Much more. 64 \"In other words,\" said Flint, \"you want part of the ice you cut.\" Indeed."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Watson negotiated a commission of 5 percent of all CTR after-tax, after-divi- dend profits. However, in light of Watson's convict ion, he would not join the firm as president, but rather as general manager. I t didn't matter. Watson would call the shots. May 1, 1914, was his first da y at CTR. Hollerith's com- pany, now Flint's company, would never be the same. It would soon become Watson's company. 65 Copying many of NCR's sales development and promoti on techniques, Watson built an organization that even Patterson wo uld have marveled at. Just as Patterson had organized the One Hundred Poi nt Club for salesmen hitting their quota, Watson began a festive Hundred Percent Club. Patterson had demanded starched white shirts and dark s u i t s a t NCR. Watson insisted CTR employees dress in an identical uniform. And Wa tson borrowed his own NCR innovation, the term THINK, which at CTR wa s impressed onto as many surfaces as could be found, from the wall a bove Watson's desk to the bottom of company stationery. These Patterson c um Watson touches were easy to implement since several key Watson aides we re old cronies from the NCR scandal days. 66 But Watson understood much more about human motivat ion than Pat- terson had ever allowed to creep into NCR. Watson w anted to inspire men to greater results, not brutalize them toward mere quo tas. His way would imbue a sense of belonging, not a climate of fear. As a general understood his troops, Watson well understood the value of the workingmen below to the executive men above. Moreover, any limitation i n his general manager title was soon overcome. In 1915, his conviction wa s overturned and within forty-eight hours the board approved his ascent to the presidency of CTR. 67 For the first years, Watson worked quietly out of h is sparse office at CTR, cementing the firm's financial, labor, and tec hnical position. He did his best to outmaneuver and neutralize the competitor t abulating machines. Pat- ent wars were fought, engineering campaigns commenc ed, research under- taken, and major clients either conquered or re-con quered. When needed, Watson arranged bank loans to see the company throu gh lean times and help it grow. 68 Hollerith, although no longer in control, remained as an active consul- tant with the company, but found Watson's style com pletely alien. Years before, while still at NCR, Watson had ordered a Ho llerith machine, but Hollerith declined to send one, fearing Watson woul d copy it for Patterson. Now that they were in the same firm, the two freque ntly butted heads on a range of issues, from commercialization to technica l research. Unlike Holle- rith, who was willing to do battle with customers o ver some barely dis-"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"cernible personal principle Watson wanted to win cu stomers over for the money. Money was his principle. Flint's chairman, G eorge Fairchild, was also a towering force at CTR to be reckoned with. Watson n avigated around both Hollerith and Fairchild. Without Flint's continuous backing, Watson could not have managed. Nonetheless, without his unique w inning style, Watson could not have persevered. 69 Watson became more than a good manager, more than j ust an impres- sive executive, more than merely a concerned employ er, he became central to the company itself. His ubiquitous lectures and pep talks were delivered with such uplifting passion, they soon transcended to li turgical inspiration. Watson embodied more than the boss. He was the Leader. He even had a song. Clad in their uniforms of dark blue suits and glist ening white shirts, the inspirited sales warriors of CTR would sing: Mister Watson is the man we're working for, He's the Leader of the C-T-R, He's the fairest, squarest man we know; Sincere and true. He has shown us how to play the game. And how to make the dough. 70 Watson was elevating to a higher plane. Newspaper a rticles began to focus on him personally as much as the company. His pervasive presence and dazzling capitalistic imperatives became a virtual religion to CTR employees. Paternalistic and authoritarian, Watson demanded ab solute loyalty and cease- less devotion from everyone. In exchange, he allowe d CTR to become an extended family to all who obeyed. 71 In 1922, Patterson died. Many have said his death w as an emotional turning point for Watson, who felt his every move w as no longer being com- pared to the cruel and ruthless cash register magna te. Some two years later, CTR Chairman Fairchild also died. By this time, Hol lerith had resigned in ennui from the CTR board of directors and completel y faded away in poor health. Watson became the company's chief executive and uncontested reign- ing authority. 72 Now CTR would be completely transformed in Watson's image. A new name was needed. In Watson's mind, \"CTR\" said nothi ng about the com- pany. The minor products, such as cheese slicers an d key-activated time clocks, had long been abandoned or marginalized. Th e company was pro- ducing vital business machines for a world market. Someone had suggested a name for a new company newsletter: International Bu siness Machines. 73 "},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"International Business Machines - Watson realized t hat the name de- scribed more than a newsletter. It was th e personif ication of what Watson and his enterprise were all about. He renamed the compa ny. His intensely deter- mined credo was best verbalized by his promise to a ll: \"IBM is more than a business—it is a great worldwide institution that i s going on forever.\" 74 More than ever. Watson f u s e d himself into every fac et of IBM's opera- tions, injecting his style into every decision, and mesmerizing the psyche of every employee. \"IBM Spirit\"—this was the term Wats on ascribed to the all- encompassing, almost tribal devotion to company tha t he demanded. \"We always refer to our people as the IBM Family,\" Wats on emphasized to his employees, \"and we mean the wives and children as w ell as the men.\" He continually spoke in terms of \"oneness\" with IBM. 75 Employees were well treated, generously compensated , entitled to ex- cellent working conditions with the most liberal be nefits and vacation times, enrolled in the IBM Country Club at Endicott, New Y ork, and invited to end- less picnics, rallies, and dances. Plus they were i nducted into the IBM Club. \"The company just won't let you get lonesome,\" assu red one Club member. Children began their indoctrination early, becoming eligible at age three for the kiddy rolls of the IBM Club, graduating to juni or ranks at age eight. 76 \"Look upon me as the head of the family,\" Watson wo uld preach. \"I want you to come to me as often as you feel that I can do anything for you. Feel free to come and open your hearts and make you r requests, just the same as one would in going to the head of a family. \" So penetrating was the Watson father image that employees routinely did as k his permission for ordinary personal decisions. John G. Phillips, for example, a man so powerful within the IBM organization that he ultimately beca me its vice-chairman, did not own an automobile until 1926; in that year, he finally approached the Leader. \"Mr. Watson,\" declared Phillips, \"I have en ough money to buy a car, but I would like your permission to do it.\" 77 Watson's own son, Tom, who inherited his father's t hrone at IBM, admitted, \"The more I worked at IBM, the more I res ented Dad for the cult- like atmosphere that surrounded him.\" 78 Large pictures of Watson in the weekly company publ ication, Business Machines, regularly sported headlines proclaiming e ven his ordinary accom- plishments, such as \"Thomas J. Watson Opens New Orl eans Office.\" The ever- present equating of his name with the word THINK wa s more than an Orwellian exercise, it was a true-life indoctrinati on.

It was written during this era that, \"probably no business man in the country gets his name and picture in the newspapers more often t han he does. Watson makes hundreds of public appearances every year at banquets, university commencements, the opening of art exhibits and simi lar occasions.\" Fortune referred to Watson as \"the Leader,\" with a capital \"L.\" So completely con- scious was Watson of his mythic quality that he eye d even the porters on trains and waiters in restaurants as potential lege nd busters. He tossed them big tips, often as much as $10, which was largesse for the day. As he once explained, \"there is a whole class of people in the world who are in a position to poor-mouth you unless you are sensitive to them. They are headwaiters, Pullman car conductors, porters and chauffeurs. The y see you in an intimate fashion and can really knock off your reputation.\" 80 By giving liberally to charities and universities, by towering as a patron of the arts, by arranging scores of organizational memberships, honorary de- grees and awards, he further cultivated the man-myt h for himself and IBM. 81 Slogans were endlessly drilled into the extended IB M Family. We For- give Thoughtful Mistakes. There Is No Such Thing As Standing Still. Pack Up Your Troubles, Mr. Watson Is Here. 82 And the songs. They began the very first day a man entered the IBM culture. They never ended during one's entire tenur e. More than 100 songs were sung at various company functions. There were several for Watson, including the \"IBM Anthem\": There's a thrill in store for all, For we're about to toast The corporation that we represent. We're here to cheer each pioneer And also proudly boast Of that \"man of men,\" our sterling president. The name of T.J.

All of it swirled around the irresistible magnetism, t h e i n t o x i c a t i n g command, the charismatic c u l t i c co ntrol of one man, Thomas J. Watson, the Leader. 84 WATSON ' S CONNECTIONS to Germany set the stage for a technologic and economic alliance with the Third Reich. It began so on after America's entry into the Great War, when CTR's pre-Dehomag property in Germany, albeit marginal, was seized by the German government for b eing owned by an enemy national. As it happened, Watson was delighte d with how CTR's assets were protected during receivership. His feelings we re best expressed in a 1937 recollection he penned to Nazi Economics Minis ter Hjalmar Schaeht. 85 \"From the day I returned to Germany after the [Grea t] War,\" Watson wrote Schacht, \"to find my Company's affairs in the best safekeeping by your Alien Property Custodian, well-administered and con scientiously managed, from the highly satisfactory experience gained in m y association with Ger- man industry after the War while building up my Com pany in Germany, all through the time of Germany's post-War suffering, r ecovery and setbacks, I have felt a deep personal concern over Germany's fa te and a growing attach- ment to the many Germans with whom I gained contact at home and abroad. This attitude has caused me to give public utteranc e to my impressions and convictions in favor of Germany at a time when publ ic opinion in my country and elsewhere was predominantly unfavorable.\" 86 He added, the world must extend \"a sympathetic unde rstanding to the German people and their aims under the leadership o f Adolf Hitler.\" 87 More than fundamental sympathy, Watson in 1933 poss essed an extra- ordinary investment in Germany. It began in the ear ly twenties during the height of Germany's tornadic post-War inflation. It was a time when valueless German currency was transported from place to place in wheelbarrows and worth more as kindling than as legal tender. In 192 2, Willy Heidinger's Dehomag was a mere licensee of Hollerith equipment. But the monetary cri- sis in Germany made it impossible for Dehomag to pa y royalties and other monies it owed to Watson's CTR, which now controlle d all of Hollerith's patents. Dehomag's debt was $104,000, or the astron omical sum of 450 bil- lion marks. There was no way Dehomag could pay it. 88 Watson traveled to Germany and ruthlessly offered H eidinger two options: bankruptcy, or handing substantial ownersh ip of Dehomag over to Watson. It began by Watson asking for only 51 perce nt of the stock. But as Dehomag's financial position weakened, Watson abrup tly upped his demand"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"to 90 percent Heidinger fell \"cornered\" with no cho ice: he ceded the Ger- man company to Watson, and Dehomag became a CTR sub sidiary. When CTR was renamed IBM in 1924, Dehomag of course cont inued as an IBM subsidiary. Heidinger was allowed to retain approxi mately 10 percent of the stock. Dehomag could then still claim some token Ge rman ownership for appearance's sake. 89 Ironically, Heidinger's shares were a virtual ruse because he could only own them as long as he worked for Dehomag. Even the n, he could not con- trol the stock. Once Heidinger left the company, he would have to sell the shares back to IBM and only IBM. Moreover, Heidinge r's shares were used as collateral against large deferred company loans and a bonus system. For all intents and purposes, IBM now controlled the Ge rman company. 90 For a decade after IBM acquired Dehomag, Watson tig hdy managed the German subsidiary's operation, setting its sales qu otas, and at the same time benefiting from technical improvements to Hollerith systems devised by Ger- man engineers. Eventually, IBM began extending its influence overseas, cre- ating subsidiaries or agencies in dozens of countri es, each with its own name. With Watson's persona bigger than IBM's name, sever al of the companies were namesakes. Watson Beige was the Belgian subsid iary. Watson Italiana was the Italian subsidiary. In Sweden, it was Svens ka Watson. In many places, the business names Watson and IBM were synonymous a nd inseparable. 91 But the German subsidiary's revenues outshone them all. Many Euro- pean countries were slow to adopt Hollerith technol ogy. Germany, however, was more willing to accept the punch card systems. Indeed, of some seventy subsidiaries and foreign branches worldwide, more t han half of IBM's over- seas income came from Dehomag alone. By 1933, Dehom ag had turned in a spectacular financial performance, 237 percent of i ts quota, and Willy Hei- dinger was due to be one of the stars at the forthc oming Hundred Percent Club convention in New York. 92 WHEN HITLER came to power, in January 1933, he made an open pro mise to create a Master Race, dominate Europe, and decimate European Jewry. Num- berless racial laws—local and national—appeared thr oughout the country. Jews could no longer advertise in the phone book or rent stalls in the mar- kets. Thousands were terminated en masse from their employment. Even Jewish-owned companies were forced to fire their Je wish employees. 93 Hitler's paper pogrom was the dull edge of the knif e. The sharp edge was violence. Unrestrained acts of depraved Nazi br utality against Jews and"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"other undesirables began at once, often in fu l l vie w of newspapermen and photographers. Windows were broken. Jews dragged fr om their homes and shops were paraded through the streets with humilia ting signs hung around their necks. Some were forced to wash the streets w ith toothbrushes. Not a few were kidnapped and tortured by Nazi gangs. Poli ce looked the other way. On March 20, 1933, a concentration camp for politic al enemies was established at the pastoral town of Dachau, ten kil ometers north of Munich. Many others soon followed. Scores of Jewish merchan ts in Essen and Muen- ster wire delivered wholesale to the infamous camps . In Frankfurt, thou- sands of frenzied Storm Troopers paraded through th e streets chanting, \"Kill the Jews.\" A London newspaper actually published a Berlin street map locat- ing a dozen Nazi torture houses. 94 By April, some 60,000 Jews had been imprisoned and 10,000 more had fled the country, appearing as refugees throughout Europe and America. Pro- fessional associations were expelling their Jewish members. Signs were hoisted in front of hotels, restaurants, beaches, a nd sometimes even at the edge of town: \"Jews Not Wanted Here.\" Jews were being sw iftly driven into economic and social exclusion as a first step. 95 Newspapers and radio broadcasts throughout the west ern countries de- clared Hitler a menace to world peace and indeed wo rld civilization. The world reacted with boycott and protest movements sp ringing up everywhere. Led by the Jews of New York and London, but support ed by men and women of conscience from all faiths and all nations, boyc otters and protesters noisily made sure that no one was unaware of the atrocities in Germany. 96 On March 27, some 20,000 protesters gathered at a m onster Madison Square Garden demonstration in New York that was br oadcast around the world. Within days, similar rallies and sympathetic movements appeared in Paris, Istanbul, Toronto, Bombay, Warsaw, and Londo n. In Salonika, 70,000 Greek Jews assembled to launch their anti-Hitler mo vement. 97 Whether in Bucharest, Antwerp, Chicago, or Belgrade , a growing world movement would not stand by passively as Jews were being targeted. Anti- German boycott and protest actions erupted across t he globe. The anti-Nazi boycott systematically identified merchants who imp orted German goods and forced them to stop by public pressure tactics. Whether it was small shops selling German china and camera film, or tour ists sailing across the Atlantic on German vessels, outraged boycotters dem anded they switch—or face a retaliatory boycott. 98 Nor was energetic support for the whole idea of ant i-German boycott the province of mere agitators. A Depression-wracke d world was eager to"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"replace the Third Reich's economic niche. Commercia l interests and labor unions everywhere saw the anti-Nazi movement as one they could eagerly join for both moral and business reasons.\" On May 10, 1933, more than 100,000 marchers, busine ssmen and union- ists alike, Jews and Christians, jammed midtown Man hattan. Newsreel cam- eras mounted on platforms filmed evocative scenes o f anti-German placards in the air amid a backdrop of furling American flag s and crowds loudly de- manded that \"in the name of humanity\" all businesse s stop doing business with Adolf Hitler. 100 The question confronting all businessmen in 1933 wa s whether trading with Germany was worth either the economic risk or moral descent. This question faced Watson at IBM as well. But IBM was i n a unique commercial position. While Watson and IBM were famous on the A merican business scene, the company's overseas operations were funda mentally below the public radar screen. IBM did not import German merc handise, it merely exported American technology. The IBM name did not even appear on any of thousands of index cards in the address files of leading New York boycott organizations. Moreover, the power of punch cards a s an automation tool had not yet been commonly identified. So the risk t hat highly visible trading might provoke economic retaliation seemed low, espe cially since Dehomag did not even possess a name suggestive of IBM or Wa tson. 101 On the other hand, the anticipated reward in German y was great. Watson had learned early on that a government in re organization, and indeed a government tighdy monitoring its society, was good news for IBM. During the Depression years, when the Franklin D. R oosevelt Administration created a massive bureaucracy to assist the public and control business, IBM doubled its size. The National Recovery Act of 1933 , for example, meant \"businesses all of a sudden had to supply the feder al government with infor- mation in huge and unprecedented amounts,\" recalled an IBM official. Extra forms, export reports, more registrations, more sta tistics—IBM thrived on red tape. 102 Nazi Germany offered Watson the opportunity to cate r to government control, supervision, surveillance, and regimentati on on a plane never before known in human history. The fact that Hitler planne d to extend his Reich to other nations only magnified the prospective profit s. In business terms, that was account growth. The technology was almost exclu sively IBM's to purvey because the firm controlled about 90 percent of the world market in punch cards and sorters. 103 As for the moral dilemma, it simply did not exist f or IBM.

The company whose first overseas census was undertaken for Czar Nicholas II, the company Hollerith invented in his German image, the company war- p r o f i t e e r i n g Flint took global, the company built o n Thomas J. Watson's cor- rugated scruples, this company saw Adolf Hitler as a valuable trading ally. Indeed, the Third Reich would open startling statis tical venues for Hollerith machines never before instituted—perhaps never before even imagined. In Hitler's Germany, the statistical and census community, overrun with doctrinaire Nazis, publicly boasted about the new demographic break- throughs their equipment would achieve. Everything about the statistical tasks IBM would be undertaking for Germany was boun d up in racial poli- tics, Aryan domination, and Jewish identification a nd persecution. WHEN HITLER rose to power, German intellect descended into madn ess. The Nazi movement was not merely a throng of hooligans pelting windows and screaming slogans. Guiding the Brown Shirts and exh orting the masses was an elite coterie of pseudo-scientists, corrupted profe ssionals, and profit-blinded industrialists. Nazi jurists, medical doctors, and a clique of scientists—each with their prestigious academic credentials—found w ays to pervert their sci- ence and higher calling to advance the cause of Ary an domination and racial persecution. At the vanguard of Hitler's intellectual shock troo ps were the statisti- cians. Naturally, statistical offices and census de partments were Dehomag's number one clients. In their journals, Nazi statist ical experts boasted of what they expected their evolving science to deliver. Al l of their high expectations depended on the continuing innovation of IBM punch cards and tabulator technology. Only Dehomag could design and execute s ystems to identify, sort, and quantify the population to separate Jews from Aryans. Friedrich Zahn, president of the Bavarian Statistic al Office, phrased it best in recalling the role of Nazi statisticians. \" The government of our Fuhrer and Reichschancellor Adolf Hitler is statistics-fri endly,\" wrote Zahn in Allge- meines Statistisches Archiv (ASA), the official jou rnal of the German Statistical Society. Zahn emphasized that Hitler's \"government not only demands phys- ical fitness and people strong in character and dis cipline, but useful knowl- edge as well. It demands not only political and eco nomic soldiers, but also scientific soldiers.\" 104 Zahn was a giant of statistics. Chairman of the Ger man Statistical Soci- ety and president from 1931 to 1936 of the Internat ional Statistical Institute,"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Zahn was by virtue of his prestigious international standing also an honorary member of the American Statistical Association. He was also a contributing member to the SS since the first days of the Hitler regime. Zahn was among those chiefly responsible for the immediate ouster of Jews from the German Statistical Society. 105 The ASA, and technical journals like it, were close ly followed at Dehomag since the publication was a virtual roadmap to the desires of Nazi statistical hierarchy. Anyone active in the statist ics world read it. No IBM office, even in the United States, could afford to overlook a subscription. Within the pages of the ASA and similar statistical technical journals, Dehomag management and engineers could review prove n statistical method- ology that sought to step-by-step identify the Jews as undesirables. In many cases, ASA articles were written in conjunction wit h Dehomag experts, describing the tedious technical workings of specif ic IBM equipment, but more importandy how they were applied or could be a pplied to Reich policy and programs. 106 From the very onset, the scientific soldiers of Hit ler's statistical shock troops openly published their mission statement. \"A bove all,\" wrote Prof. Dr. Johannes Muller, in a 1934 edition of ASA, \"remembe r that several very important problems are being tackled currendy, prob lems of an ideological nature. One of those problems is race politics, and this problem must be viewed in a statistical light.\" Muller, president o f the Thuringen Statistical Office, made his comments in a revealing 1934 ASA a rticle entided 'The Position of Statistics in the New Reich.\" 107 About the same time, Dr. Karl Keller, writing in an article, \"The Ques- tion of Race Statistics,\" made clear that Jewish bl ood was to be traced as far back as possible. \"If we differentiate in statistic s between Aryans and Non- Aryans, we in essence talk about Jews and non-Jews. In any case, we will not look at religious affiliation alone but also ancest ry.\" Like other Nazis, Keller was looking ahead to the domination of all Europe. Keller added, \"beyond agreeing on the definition of race, we must move to ward agreement on the number of races, at least as far as Europe is conce rned ... in reality, the Jews are not a race, but a mix of several races.\" 108 Drawing on the emerging pseudo-academic notions of the exploding race science field in Germany, Keller urged doctors to examine the popula- tion for racial characteristics and faithfully reco rd the information. \"However, not every physician can carry out these examination s,\" Keller cautioned. \"The physician must also undergo special anthropological training. 109 "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"\"The only way to eliminate any mistakes, Keller i n s i s t e d , \"is the regis- tration of the entire population. How is this to be done?\" Keller demanded \"the establishment of mandatory personal genetic-bi ographical forms. . . . Nothing would hinder us,\" he assured, \"from using t hese forms to enter any important information which can be used by race sci entists.\" 110 Zahn, in his writings, was explicit in the need to annihilate inferior eth- nic groups. In his 1937 ASA article entitled \"Devel opment of German Popula- tion Statistics through Genetic-Biological Stock-Ta king,\" Zahn specified, \"population politics, based on the principles of ra cial hygiene, must promote valuable genetic stock. It must prevent the fertili ty of inferior life and genetic degeneration. In other words, this means the target ed selection and promo- tion of superior life and an eradication of those p ortions of the population which are undesirable.\" 111 In other articles, and in keynote speeches for stat istical conventions, Zahn stressed, \"There is almost no area of life in Germany which has not been creatively pollinated by the National Socialis t ideology. . . This is also true for the field of statistics. Statistics has be come invaluable for the Reich, and the Reich has given statistics new tasks in pea ce and in war.\" 112 Zahn declared, \"Small wonder. In its very essence, statistics is very close to the National Socialist movement.\" He added, \"Ger man statistics has not only become the registering witness . . . but also the creative co-conspirator of the great events of time.\" 113 Indeed, as co-conspirators, Nazi statisticians work ed hand-in-hand with the battalions of Hitler's policy enablers and enfo rcers, from the Nazi Party's Race Political Office and all its many allied agenc ies to the SS itself. Identify- ing the Jews was only the first step along the road to Jewish destruction in Germany. 114 None of the publicly voiced statements of Hitler's scientific soldiers ever dissuaded Dehomag or IBM NY from withdrawing f rom their collabora- tion with the Reich. By necessity, that collaborati on was intense, indispens- able. and continuous. Indeed, the IBM method was to first anticipate the needs of government agencies and only then design p roprietary data solu- tions, train official staff, and even implement the programs as a sub-contrac- tor when called upon. IBM machines were useless in crates. Tabulators and punch cards were not delivered ready to use like typewriters, adding machines, or even ma- chine guns. Each Hollerith system had to be custom- designed by Dehomag engineers. Systems to inventory spare aircraft part s for the Luftwaffe, track"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"railroad schedules for Reichsbahn and register the Jews within the popula- tion for the Reich Statistical Office were each des igned by Dehomag engi- neers to be completely different from each other. 115 Of course the holes could not be punched just anywh ere. Each card had to be custom-designed with data fields and colu mns precisely desig- nated for the card readers. Reich employees had to be trained to use the cards. Dehomag needed to understand the most intima te details of the intended use, design the cards, and then create the codes. 116 Because of the almost limitless need for tabulators in Hitler's race and geopolitical wars, IBM NY reacted enthusiastically to the prospects of Nazism. While other fearful or reviled American bus inessmen were curtailing or canceling their dealings in Germany, Watson emba rked upon an historic expansion of Dehomag. Just weeks after Hitler came to power, IBM NY invested more than 7 million Reichsmarks—in excess of a million dollars— to dramatically expand the German subsidiary's abil ity to manufacture machines. 117 To be sure, Dehomag managers were as fervently devo ted to the Nazi movement as any of Hitler's scientific soldiers. IB M NY understood this from the outset. Heidinger, a rabid Nazi, saw Dehomag's unique ability to imbue the Reich with population information as a virtual calling from God. His enraptured passion for Dehomag's sudden new role wa s typically expressed while opening a new IBM facility in Berlin. \"I feel it almost a sacred action,\" declared Heidinger emotionally, \"I pray the blessin g of heaven may rest upon this place.\" 118 That day, while standing next to the personal repre sentative of Watson and IBM, with numerous Nazi Party officials in atte ndance, Heidinger pub- licly announced how in tune he and Dehomag were wit h the Nazi race scien- tists who saw population statistics as the key to e radicating the unhealthy, inferior segments of society. \"The physician examines the human body and determin es whether . . . all organs are working to the benefit of the entire organism,\" asserted Hei- dinger to a crowd of Nazi officials. \"We [Dehomag] are very much like the physician, in that we dissect, cell by cell, the Ge rman cultural body. We report every individual characteristic . . . on a lit tle card. These are not dead cards, quite to the contrary, they prove later on t hat they come to life when the cards are sorted at a rate of 25,000 per hour a ccording to certain charac- teristics. These characteristics are grouped like t he organs of our cultural body, and they will be calculated and determined wi th the help of our tabu- lating machine. 119 "},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"\"We are proud that we may assist in such task, a ta sk that provides our nation's Physician [Adolf Hitler] with the material he needs for his examina- t i o n s .

The IBM Leader cabled Heidinger a prompt note of co ngratulations for a job well done and sentiments well expressed. 121 It was right about this time that Watson decided to engrave the five steps leading up to the door of the IBM School in E ndicott, New York, with five of his favorite words. This school was the pla ce where Watson would train his valued disciples in the art of sales, eng ineering, and technical sup- port.

They blamed the Jews—for e verything. 52"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Jews had conspired to create the Depression, to ens lave the German race, to control society, and to pollute Aryan blood. And no w the followers of Hitler would exact their bizarre brand of justice and reve nge. More precisely, the Nazis planned to uproot the ali en Jews from their prized positions within German commerce and culture . The angry young men of the SA, many of them dregs within German society , believed they would soon step into all the economic and professional po sitions held by their Jew- ish neighbors. Through unending racial statutes ous ting Jews from profes- sional and commercial life, relentless purges and p ersecution, unyielding programs of asset confiscation, systematic imprison ment and outright expul- sion, the SA would usurp the Jewish niche. Nazis wo uld assume Jewish jobs, expropriate Jewish companies, seize Jewish property , and in all other ways banish Jews from every visible facet of society. On ce the Nazis finished with the Jews of Germany, they would extend their race w ar first to the Greater Reich in Europe they envisioned, and ultimately to the entire Continent. 1 But Jewish life could only be extinguished if the N azis could identify the Jews. Just which of Germany's 60 million citize ns were Jewish? And just what was the definition of \"Jewish\"? Germans Jews w ere among the most assimilated of any in Europe. Nazi mythology accused Jews of being an alien facto r in German soci- ety. But in truth, Jews had lived in Germany since the fourth century. As else- where in Europe during the Middle Ages, what German Jews could do and say, even their physical dress, was oppressively re gulated. Waves of persecu- tion were frequent. Worse, anti-Jewish mobs often o rganized hangings and immolation at the stake. Even when left alone, Germ an Jews could exist only in segregated ghettos subject to a long list of pro hibitions. 2 The pressure to escape Germany's medieval persecuti on created a very special kind of European Jew, one who subordinated his Jewish identity to the larger Christian society around him. Assimilati on became a desirable anti- dote, especially among Jewish intellectuals during the Age of Enlightenment. When Napoleon conquered part of Germany in the earl y nineteenth century, he granted Jews emancipation. But after Napoleon wa s defeated, the harsh German status quo ante was restored. The taste of f reedom, however, led affluent and intellectual Jewish classes to assimil ate en masse. Philosophi- cally, assimilationists no longer considered themse lves Jews living in Ger- many. Instead, they saw themselves as Germans who, by accident of birth, were of Jewish ancestry. 3 Many succumbed to the German pressure to convert to Christianity. German Jewry lost to apostasy many of its best comm ercial, political, and"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"intellectual leaders. A far greater number were con vinced that Jewish ethnic identity should be denied, but nonetheless saw qui ntessential value in the tenets of Moses. These German Jews developed a reli gious movement that was the forerunner of Reform Judaism. Yet, even man y of this group ulti- mately converted to Christianity. 4 Between 1869 and 1871, Germany granted Jews emancip ation from many, but not all, civic, commercial, and political restrictions. Germany's Jews seized the chance to become equals. They changed th eir surnames, adopted greater religious laxity through Reform Judaism, an d frequently married non-Jews, raising their children as Christians. Out right conversion became common. Many of Jewish ancestry did not even know i t—or care. 5 In fact, of approximately 550,000 Jews in Germany w ho were emanci- pated in 1871, roughly 60,000 were by 1930 either a postates, children raised without Jewish identity by a mixed marriage, or Jew s who had simply drifted away. Even those consciously remaining within organ ized Jewish \"communi- ties\" neglected their remnant Jewish identity. The Jews of twentieth-century Germany, like their Christian neighbors, embraced n ational identity far more than religious identity. In the minds of German Jew s, they were \"101 per- cent\" German, first and foremost. 6 But the Reich believed otherwise. The Jewish nemesi s was not one of religious practice, but of bloodline. Nazis were de termined to somehow identify those of Jewish descent, and destroy them. IDENTIFYING THE Jews in Germany would be an uphill technologic chal - lenge that would take years of increasingly honed c ounting programs and registration campaigns. From the moment Hitler was appointed Chancellor, fear gripped the entire Jewish community. No Jew wa nted to step forward and identify himself as Jewish, and therefore becom e targeted for persecu- tion. Many doubted they even possessed enough Jewis h parentage to be included in the despised group. Indeed, not a few f rightened Jews tried to join the denunciations of the Jewish community to e mphasize their loyal German national character. 7 But that did not help them. The identification process began in the first weeks of the Third Reich on April 12, 1933, when the Hitler regime announced that a long delayed census of all Germans would take place immediately. Friedrich Burgdorfer, director of the Reich Statistical Office, expressed the agency's official grati- tude that the \"government of our national uprising had ordered the census.\" Burgdorfer, a virulent Nazi, also headed up the Naz i Party's Race Political"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Office and became a leading figure in the German Society for Racial Hygiene. He was jubilant because he understood that Germany could not be cleansed of Jews until it i d e n t i f i e d them—however l ong that would take. 8 The Nazis wanted fast answers about their society a nd who among them was Jewish. Censuses in Germany had long asked typical and innocent questions of religious affiliation. But since the G reat War, European popula- tion shifts and dislocations had brought many more Jews to Germany, espe- cially from Poland. No one knew how many, where the y lived, or what jobs they held. Most of all, no one knew their names. Th e Nazis knew prior cen- suses were plagued by three to five years of hand s orting, rendering the re- sulty virtually useless for enacting swift social p olicies. If only the Nazis could at least obtain information on the 41 million Germa ns living in Prussia, Ger- many's largest state, comprising three-fifths of th e German populace. How fast? Nazi planners wanted all 41 million Prussians processed and prelimi- nary results produced within a record four months. The Prussian government itself was completely incapable of launching such a massive undertaking. 9 But IBM's Dehomag was. The company offered a soluti on: it would handle almost the entire project as a contract. Deh omag would design a cen- sus package counting and classifying every citizen. Moreover, it would recruit, train, and even feed the hundreds of tempo rary workers needed to process the census and perform the work on Dehomag' s own premises. If the government would gather the information, Dehomag wo uld handle every- thing else. To secure the deal, Dehomag turned to i ts special consultant for governmental contracts, attorney Karl Koch. 10 Koch enjoyed good Nazi Party as well as government connections. With Watson's help, Koch had recently traveled to IBM of fices in New York to learn more about the company's technical capabiliti es and pick up tips on negotiating tough government contracts. By late May 1933, Koch was able to joyously report to Watson that he had secured a RM 1.35 million contract to conduct the Prussian census. This was a test case f or Dehomag's relationship with the Nazi Reich. \"We now have a chance to demon strate what we are capable to do,\" Koch wrote to Watson. 11 Koch was careful to credit his recent training in t he United States. \"Equipped with increased knowledge,\" Koch wrote Wat son, \"and strength- ened by the experience collected during my highly i nspiring trip to the States, I was able to conduct the lengthy negotiati ons and to accomplish the difficult work.\" 12 Watson wrote back a letter of appreciation to Koch and hoped he would \"have the pleasure of visiting your country n ext year.\" 13 "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Organizing the census was a prodigious task. Dehoma g hired some 900 temporary staffers, mainly supplied by the Berlin e mployment office, which had become dominated by the venomous German Labor F ront. Dehomag enjoyed good relations with the German Labor Front, which ranked at the vanguard of radical Nazism. Coordinating with the B erlin employment office christened the enterprise as a patriotic duty, sinc e relieving joblessness was a major buzzword objective of Hitler's promise to Ger many. Dehomag's two- week immersion data processing courses instructed s eventy to seventy-five people at a time in daily four-hour sessions. 14 Statistical battalions were emerging. The Berlin em ployment office allo- cated large, well-lit halls for their training. Loo king from the rear of the train- ing hall, one saw a sea of backs, each a matronly d ressed woman sporting a no-nonsense bun hairdo, tilted over census forms an d punching machines. Packed along rows of wooden study benches, even beh ind view-blocking pil- lars, trainees diligently took notes on small pads and scrutinized their over- sized census forms. Methodically, they learned to e xtract and record the vital personal details. Large \"Smoking Prohibited\" signs pasted above the front wall reinforced the regimented nature of the settin g. At the front, next to a blackboard, an instructor wearing a white lab coat explained the complicated tasks of accurately punching in data from handwritt en census questionnaires, operating the sorting, tabulating, and verifying ma chines, and other data pro- cessing chores. 15 On June 16, 1933, one-half million census takers, r ecruited from the ranks of the \"nationalistically minded,\" went door- to-door gathering infor- mation. Cadres of Storm Troopers and SS officers we re added to create a vir- tual census army. In some localities, when recruitm ent flagged, individuals were coerced into service. The interviews included pointed questions about the head of the household's religion and whether th e person was in a mixed marriage. 16 In essence, the amount of data that could be stored on a card was a function of the number of holes and columns. A spec trum of data could be extracted by simply recording different combination s of hole punches. For that reason, Dehomag abandoned its standard 45-colu mn cards and moved to a 60-column format. Sixty columns, each with ten horizontal positions, created 600 punch hole possibilities per card. Each column, depending upon how it was punched, represented a biographical char acteristic. These 600 punch holes, arrayed in their endless combinations, yielded thousands of demographic permutations. Even still, Dehomag offic ials wondered whether all the data the Reich needed could be accommodated on the 60-column"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"cards they were using. Dehomag declared in a compan y newsletter that it was willing to move to an 80-column format tor the census, if required \"for political reasons.\" 17 Soon the Reich could begin the identification proc ess— who was Aryan and who was a Jew. Population statistics had crossed the fiery border from a science of anonymous masses to the investigation of individual s. IN MID - SEPTEMBER , 1933, 6,000 brown cardboard boxes began unceremo- niously arriving at the cavernous Alexanderplatz ce nsus complex in Berlin. Each box was stuffed with questionnaires manually f illed out by pen and pencil, but soon to be processed by an unprecedente d automated praxis. As supervisors emptied their precious cargo at the Pru ssian Statistical Office, each questionnaire—one per household—was initialed by an intake clerk, stacked, and then transferred downstairs. \"Downstai rs\" led to Dehomag's massive 22,000-square-foot hall, just one floor bel ow, specifically rented for the project. 18 Messengers shuttling stacks of questionnaires from the Statistical Office to Dehomag bounded down the right-hand side of an e nclosed stairwell. As they descended the short flight, the sound of click ing became louder and louder. At the landing, they turned left and pushed through the doors. As the doors swung open, they encountered an immense high- ceilinged, hangar-like facility reverberating with the metallic music of H ollerith technology. Some 450 data punchers deployed in narrow rows of punchi ng stations labored behind tall upright secretarial displays perfectly matched to the oversized census questionnaires. 19 Turning left again, and then another right brought the messengers to a long windowed wall lined with narrow tables. The fo rms were piled there. From these first tables, the forms were methodicall y distributed to central- ized desks scattered throughout the work areas. The census forms were then loaded onto small trolleys and shutded again, this time to individual work stations, each equipped with a device that resemble d a disjointed typewriter - actually an input engine. 20 A continuous \"Speed Punching\" operation ran two shi fts, and three when needed. Each shift spanned 7.5 hours with 60 m inutes allotted for \"fresh air breaks\" and a company-provided meal. Day and night, Dehomag staffers entered the details on 41 million Prussian s at a rate of 150 cards per hour. Allowing for holidays and a statistical predi ction of absenteeism, yet ever obsessed with its four-month deadline, Dehomag decreed a quota of"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"450,000 cards per day for its workforce. Free coffe e was provided to keep people awake. A gymnast was brought in to demonstra te graceful aerobics and other techniques to relieve fatigue. Company of ficials bragged that the 41 million processed cards, if stacked, would tower two and a half times higher than the Zugspitze, Germany's 10,000-foot mo untain peak. Dehomag intended to reach the summit on time. 21 As company officials looked down upon a floor plan of the layout, the linear rows and intersecting columns of work statio ns must have surely resembled a grandiose punch card itself animated in to a three-dimensional bricks and mortar reality. Indeed, a company poster produced for the project showed throngs of miniscule people scrambling over a punch card sketch. 22 The surreal artwork was more than symbolic. Once punched, the columns were imbued with personal information about the individual: county, community, gender, ag e, religion, mother tongue, number of children, current occupation, and second job, if any. 23 \"Be Aware!\" reminded huge block-lettered signs faci ng each cluster of data entry clerks. Instructions were made clear and simple. Column 22 RELI- GION was to be punched at hole 1 for Protestant, ho le 2 for Catholic, or hole 3 for Jew. Columns 23 and 24 N ATIONALITY were to be coded in row 10 for Polish speakers. 24 After punching, the cards were shuttled to a separa te section of the hall, where they passed through long, squat Hollerith cou nters at the rate of 24,000 per hour. The system kept track of its own p rogress. Hence, Dehomag was always aware whether it was on schedule. Once c ounted, the cards moved to the proofing section. No errors would be t olerated and speed was essential. Proofing machines tabulated and verified proper punching for more than 15,000 cards per hour. 25 When Jews were discovered within the population, a special \"Jewish counting card\" recorded the place of birth. These J ewish counting cards were processed separately. 26 Then came the awesome sorting and resorting process for twenty-five categories of information cross-indexed and filtere d through as many as thirty-five separate operations—by profession, by r esidence, by national ori- gin, and a myriad of other traits. It was all to be correlated with information from land registers, community lists, and church au thorities to create a fan- tastic new database. What emerged was a profession- by-profession, city-by- city, and indeed a block-by-block revelation of the Jewish presence. 27 A Reich Statistical Office summary reported: \"The l argest concentration of Jews [in Berlin] will be found in the Wilmersdor f district. Approximately"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"26,000 Observant Jews account for 13.54 percent of the population within that district.\" Further: a total of 1,200 \"Fur-Jews \" accounted for 5.28 percent of the furrier trade, and nearly three-fourths of t hose are foreign-born. Fur- ther: based on existing emigration trends triggered by anti-Jewish persecu- tion \"only 415,000 to 425,000 Faith-Jews would rema in in the German Reich by the middle of 1936.\" 28 Dehomag's precious information would now help prope l a burgeoning new binary of pseudo-science and official race hat red. Racial hygiene, race politics, and a constellation of related anti-Semit ic disciplines were just so much talk in the absence of genuine statistics. Now a lightning storm of anti- Jewish legislation and decrees restricting Jews fro m all phases of academic, professional, governmental, and commercial life wou ld be empowered by the abil i t y to target the Jews by individual name. Moreover, by cross-sorting the Jews revealed in Column 22 row 3 with Polish sp eakers identified in Columns 26 and 27 row 10, the Reich was able to ide ntify who among the Jews would be its first targets for confiscation, a rrest, imprisonment, and ulti- mately expulsion. The so-called Ostjuden, or Easter n Jews, primarily from Poland, would be the first to go. 29 Friedrich Zahn, publisher of Allgemeines Statistisc hes Archiv, summed up the glee when he wrote, \"In using statistics, the g overnment now has the road map to switch from knowledge to deeds.\" 30 DEHOMAG ' S CENSUS undertaking was an unparalleled accomplishment for IBM. Watson was impressed from the moment Karl Koch secured the con- tract. Clearly, there was a lucrative future for IB M in Nazi Germany. At a time when other foreign companies were fleeing the Reich 's violence, repression, anti-Semitism, and the inability to retrieve income from German operations, Watson moved swiftly to dramatically enlarge IBM's presence. First, he ordered the merger of several small IBM s ubsidiaries in Ger- many. Optima, Degemag, Holgemag, as well as the exi sting Dehomag, were folded into a new corporation also to be named \"Deh omag.\" Through a cun- ning twirl of losses and profits among the four Ger man companies, and then manipulating balances owed by those subsidiaries to IBM NY for so-called \"loans,\" Reich profit taxes would be avoided, despi te record earnings in Ger- many. IBM NY would simply apply the incomes to the contrived loans it had extended to its own subsidiaries. IBM's Maryland di vision was used as a con- duit for the loan transactions. A report from IBM's accountants to the corpo- rate treasurer was explicit: \"the motive for the me rger was to effect an annual"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"pavings in taxes by reducing Dehomag's net profits by the amount of the net losses of Optima and [old] Dehomag. . . about $30,0 00 annually.\" 31 Heidinger confirmed in a special report to Watson, \"As the merger of Degemag, [old] Dehomag, and Optima is effected . . . corporation profits tax is out of the question ... on account of the relief from [loan] claims of IBM, as thereby no profit, but merely a reduction of los ses, is obtained.\" 32 Second, IBM increased its investment in Dehomag fro m a mere RM 400,000 to more than RM 7 million—about a million D epression-era Ameri- can dollars. This would include a million Reichsmar ks to purchase new land in Berlin and build IBM's first German factory. IBM was tooling up for what it correcdy saw as a massive economic relationship wit h the Hitler regime. In the midst of America's Depression, this expansion o f manufacturing base would not relieve unemployment in the United States , but actually transfer American jobs to Nazi Germany where the Hollerith m achines would be manufactured. 33 Understandably, Watson decided to visit Germany to observe condi- tions first hand, which he did on October 13, 1933. Despite a highly publi- cized boycott against German ocean liners, he ignor ed picket lines and sailed on the German ship Bremen. 34 Watson was impressed with what he saw in Berlin. Th e Watsons and the Heidingers managed many happy social moments togeth er. Mrs. Watson even asked Heidinger for a copy of his portrait as a mem ento of their joyous time. Heidinger sent two. 35 Watson also visited the massive census operation at Alexanderplatz. There among the rows of data clicking clerks arraye d before their large block- letter instructions to enter Jews in Column 22 row 3, amid the clatter of shiny, black sorters flickering punch cards into a blur, Watson was moved to donate money to buy meals for everyone at IBM ex pense. As an added gesture, he authorized Dresden pastries for each an d every member of the Statistical Office's Census Department. Heidinger l ater wrote to Watson that the total bill for his \"bountiful gift\" of 6,060 me als disbursed to 900 staffers came in at just under 4,000 Reichsmarks. 36 More than just hot meals and baked goods, Watson wa nted to make sure Dehomag was successful and effective. He personally dispatched Eugene Hartley, a top IBM census expert and manager of the firm's statistical depart- ment to advise Dehomag. Hartley would oversee costs in Berlin and become acquainted with all details of Dehomag's census ope ration and its methods. These details were to be recorded in a special hand book. No copies would exist. Senior management at Dehomag sent Watson an RCA Radiogram de-"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"claring. \"We especially appreciate your foresight i n Bending Mister Hartley who as a census expert is especially helpful to us at a time when we are undertaking greatest service job ever done by any I BM agency.\" 37 Most gratifying to the Germans was the secret pact between Watson and Heidinger, entered into that October 1933, whil e Watson was touring Dehomag. At a time when the Hitler government was d eclaring its war inten- tions in Europe, Watson's secret deal granted Heidi nger and Dehomag spe- cial commercial powers outside of Germany. Although there were IBM agencies and subsidiaries throughout Europe, Dehoma g would be permitted to circumvent and supplant each one, soliciting and delivering punch card solution technology directly to IBM customers in th ose territories. That gave Dehomag entree to the major foreign corporations, f oreign national railroads, and foreign government offices across the Continent . IBM subsidiaries, such as those in Brussels, Paris, and Warsaw would still exist. But now Nazified Dehomag could usurp their clients and even their ma nufacturing base. 38 The extraordinary arrangement virtually reinvented Dehomag as a de facto \"IBM Europe.\" Subject to IBM NY oversight, th e German subsidiary was granted free rein to cultivate its special bran d of statistical services to other nearby countries, especially Austria, Czechos lovakia, Poland, Belgium, France, and Holland. Where census, registration, an d other statistical opera- tions did not exist, or where they could be updated along the lines of Ger- many's anti-Semitic model, Dehomag could now move i n. In essence, before the Third Reich advanced across any border, its sci entific soldiers would already have a vital outpost. With its new potency to create a German sphere of s tatistical influence across the continent, no wonder senior management i n November 1933 sent Watson a jointly signed cable proclaiming, \"Your vi sit to Germany has brought encouragement not only to Dehomag, but to t he German people.\" 39 CONSIDERING THE far-reaching importance of the Watson-Heidinger agr ee- ment for commercial hegemony, and the certainty of upsetting other IBM subsidiaries, Watson committed nothing to paper abo ut his secret territorial agreement with Heidinger. Deniability seemed to be the order of the day. Clearly, Watson possessed an understanding of the v alue of deniability. When he was prosecuted for criminal conspiracy in t he National Cash Regis- ter case, he was confronted by exhibit after exhibi t of his own incriminating writings, such as instructions to destroy competito rs and create fake compa- nies. That error would not happen again. Moreover, IBM was at that very"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"moment being prosecuted by the U.S. Justice Departm ent's anti-trust divi- sion for additional secretive acts of monopoly and unfair competition involv- ing punch card technology. 40 Watson developed an extraordinary ability to write reserved and clev- erly cautious letters. More commonly, he remained s ilent and let subordi- nates and managers do the writing for him. But they too respected an IBM code—unwritten, of course—to observe as much discre tion as possible in memos and correspondence. This was especially so in the case of corre- sponding with or about Nazi Germany, the most contr oversial business part- ner of the day. For example, a few weeks after Watson left Germany, one of IBM's European managers in Paris, M. G. Connally, was ass igned to monitor details of the merger of IBM's four subsidiaries. On Novemb er 18, 1933, Connally wrote a letter to Heidinger concluding with the sen timent: \"I only wish we had someone here to do things the way you people do in Germany.\" Shortly thereafter, Connally circulated a copy of that lett er to Watson and other exec- utives at IBM NY. Connally sheepishly scribbled und er the last sentence, \"I think now I shouldn't have said this.\" 41 Whether or not Watson wanted to keep the Dehomag ex pansion deal a secret, Heidinger was clearly irked by the absence of any proof that he could literally invade any other subsidiary's territory. Census offices and other IBM customers in other countries would be surprised if abrupdy contacted by a Dehomag agent. And any IBM subsidiary manager would surely challenge a Dehomag attempt to steal its business. After many months of waiting, Heidinger suddenly de manded some written proof. On August 27, 1934, he pointedly cabled Watson, \"We need urgendy by cable and following letter confirmation for our rig ht granted by you per- sonally to deliver our German manufactured machines for entire European market.... This right does not include any obligati on of your European com- panies to give any orders.\" 42 Watson gave in. The next day, August 28, he dispatc hed a radiogram to Berlin: \"Confirming agreement reached between us last conference in Berlin. We extend German company rights to manufact ure machines under our patents for all European countries. Formal cont ract following by mail. Thomas Watson.\" 43 But the contract that followed by mail was not acce ptable to the Ger- mans. Heidinger detested negotiating with Watson an d bitterly remembered how he had lost his company during the post-War inf lation. Now, during"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"the new Hitler era, Watson wanted Dehomag to prolif erate punch card tech- nology throughout the continent, generating huge co ntracts. But sales would be funneled through the local IBM subsidiaries rath er than through Dehomag's blocked bank accounts. Heidinger reluctan tly agreed, but didn't trust Watson and insisted that he be vindicated not just with a new agree- ment, but written confirmation that this expansion pact was originally sealed almost a year before. 44 So on September 11, Watson again cabled Heidinger: \"Confirming agreement reached between us in Berlin October 1933 . We extend by that agreement your company rights to manufacture and to sell our machines to all European Hollerith companies.\" Watson followed it up with a signed letter confirmi n g that he had indeed sent the cable, and q uoting the exact text. The cable and letter were sent to Nazi Germany. In Amer ica, however, the car- bons were carefully placed in the file of IBM Finan cial Vice President and close Watson confidant, Otto E. Braitmayer. A hand- scrawled note confirmed exactly where the carbons were being kept: \"Carbons of Letter of Septem- ber 11, 1934 to Willy Heidinger in which Mr. Watson confirmed cable of Sept 11 regarding agreement that German Co has righ ts to mfg and sell IBM machines to all Europe in Braitmayer files.\" 45 Deniability in the face of the undeniable required a special mindset. At every twist and turn of IBM's growing relationship with Adolf Hitler, Watson and the other executives of IBM NY were confronted with four undeniable realities. First, barbaric anti-Semitic violence and general r epression were every- where in Germany and clearly part of a methodical p rogram to destroy the Jews. Second, popular and diplomatic protest agains t the Hitler regime in America, and indeed throughout the world, was highl y visible and threaten- ing to any business that traded with Germany. Third , any corporation willing to ignore the moral distaste and public outcry acce pted the stark realities of doing business in the Third Reich: unpredictable lo cal and national Nazi personalities and regulations, confiscatory taxes, revenues trapped in blocked German bank accounts that could only be used within Germany, and the absolute certainty that the company and its employe es would be integrated into the fabric of the Nazi game plan. Fourth, he w ho helped Germany helped Hitler prepare for war. Anti-Semitic violence and general repression in Ger many was an unde- niable fact for all in America, but especially for anyone who could read the front page or the first few pages of the New York T imes, listen to a radio broadcast, or watch a newsreel. In the formative mo nths of February, March,"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"and April 1911 Watson and h i s colleagues at IBM wer e exposed to not just several articles in the New York Times, but scoress of them each week detailing ghastly anti-Semitic brutality. On many days, the N ew York papers were filled with literally dozens of repression and atrocity re ports. March 18, New York Times: In an article detailing N azi plans to destroy Jewish professional life, the paper reported that a quarter of all Jewish attor- neys would be forced to retire each year until they were all gone. It wasn't just the legal profession. Within weeks all German Jews expected to be ousted from their professional positions and occupa tions, the paper wrote. 46 March 20, New York Times: The page one center headl ine decried, \"Ger- man Fugitives Tell of Atrocities at Hands of Nazis. \" Making clear that \"iron- clad censorship\" in Germany was preventing most of the truth from emerging, the paper nonetheless enumerated a series of heinou s acts. For example, at Alexanderplatz in Berlin, just down the street from the Prussian Statistical Office complex, Brown Shirts invaded a restaurant p opular with Jewish busi- nessmen. Waving a list of names of the restaurant's Jewish customers, the Brown Shirts \"formed a double line to the restauran t door.\" They called each Jew out by name and made him run a gauntlet. As a J ew passed, each Storm Trooper \"smashed him in the face and kicked him wit h heavy boots, until finally the last in the line, knocked him into the street.\" The last Jew to run the gaundet was beaten so severely, \"his face resem bled a beefsteak,\" the newspaper reported. 47 March 21, New York Times: Under a page one banner h eadline declar- ing, \"Reichstag Meeting Today is Prepared to Give H itler Full Control As Dic- tator,\" was a special two-column dispatch from Muni ch. \"Chief of Police Himmler of Munich today informed newspaper men here that the first of several concentration camps will be established nea r this city.\" 48 By April 20, about the time Watson decided IBM shou ld solicit the cen- sus project, New York Times headlines reported more than 10,000 refugees had fled Germany in the face of daily home invasion s, tortures, and kidnap- pings; 30,000 more were already imprisoned in camps or prisons; and another 100,000 were facing economic ruination and even starvation. On May 10, about the time IBM was at the height of its negotiations for the cen- sus, the world was further shocked when Nazis stage d their first and most publicized mass book burning. By the end of May, wh en Dehomag's contract with the Reich was finalized, the New York Times an d the rest of America's media had continuously published detailed accounts of Jews being brutally ousted from one profession after another: judges ce remoniously marched"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"out of their courtrooms, lawyers pushed from their offices, doctors expelled f r o m t h e i r c l i n i c s , professors drummed out of their classrooms, retailers evicted from their own stores, and scientists barre d from their own labs. 49 On June 11, the day before the door-to-door census taking began, the New York Times reported that the government was sea rching through the backgrounds of more than 350,000 government workers to identify which among them might be of \"Jewish extraction who are l iable to dismissal.\" In that same edition, the New York Times rendered a pa ge-specific summary of Adolf Hitler's book, Mein Kampf, explaining how com pletely public his pro- gram of Jewish annihilation was. Hitler declared on page 344, reported the New York Times, \"If at the beginning of the [Great] War, 12,000 or 15,000 of these corrupters of the people [Jews] had been held under poison gas . . . then the sacrifice of millions at the front would n ot have been in vain . . . 12,000 scoundrels removed at the right time might p erhaps have saved the lives of one million proper Germans.\" 50 By the time Watson was organizing his plans to set sail on the Bremen, on August 29, 1933, the New York Times, in a page o ne article, reported the exiustence of sixty-five brutal concentration camps holding some 45,000 Jew- ish and non-Jewish inmates; an equal number were in carcerated at a variety of other locations, creating a total of some 90,000 held. 51 Banner headlines, riveting radio broadcasts, and gr aphic newsreels depicting the systematic destruction of Jewry's pla ce in Germany must have seemed endless. Blaring media reports made it impos sible for anyone at IBM to deny knowledge of the situation in the Third Rei ch. But what made a technologic alliance with the Reich even more diffi cult—moment-to-moment - was an America that everywhere was loudly protest ing the Hitler campaign of Jewish destruction. To ally with Germany at that time meant going against the will of an enraged nation—indeed an enflamed wo rld. Although anti-German protest marches, picket lines, boycotts, and noisy demands to stop the atrocities were in full swing o n every continent of the world, nowhere would protest have appeared more omn ipresent than to a businessman in New York City. In New York, the air burned with anti-Nazi a g i t a t i o n . All sectors of society—from labor unions to business leaders, from Catholic bishops to Protestant deacons to defiant r abbis—rallied behind the battlee cry that humanity must starve Depression-ba ttered Germany into abandoning her anti-Semitic course. \"Germany Will C rack This Winter,\" read the placards and the leaflets. 52 Typical of the vehemence was the giant demonstratio n at Madison Square"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Garden on March 27, 1933. Culminating days of loud marches throughout the New York-New Jersey area and highly publicized denu nciations, the Madi- son Square Garden event was calculated to shut down New York—and it did. At noon on March 27, business stopped. Stores and s chools closed across Greater New York as employees were released for the day. The rally didn't start until after 8:00 P . M ., but by that afternoon, large crowds were already lined up outside the Garden. Once the doors were unlocked, the flow of protesters began. It continued for hours. T raffic snarled as thousands jammed the streets trying to wedge closer. Demonstr ators heading for the rally were backed all the way down the subway stair s. Six hundred police- men formed a bluecoat chain along the crosswalks ju st to allow pedestrians to pass. 53 When the doors shut, only 20,000 boycotters made it inside. So public loudspeakers were hastily erected for an estimated 35,000 keyed-up citizens crammed around the streets of the Garden. Police an d protest marshals diverted several thousand to a second ad hoc rally at nearby Columbus Cir- cle. It wasn't enough. More overflow rallies were f rantically set up along the nearby intersections. 54 Synchronized programs were at that moment waiting i n Chicago, Wash- ington, Houston, and about seventy other American c ities. At each supportive gathering, thousands huddled around loudspeakers wa iting for the Garden event to commence. That day, at least one million J ews participated nation- wide. Perhaps another million Americans of non-Jewi sh heritage stood with them shoulder-to-shoulder. Hundreds of thousands mo re in Europe were preparing sympathetic demonstrations, fasts, and bo ycotts. 55 New York and Thomas Watson had never seen anything like it. From the windows of IBM at 270 Broadway, the massive dem onstration was an unmistakable message: Don't do business with Hitler . Moreover, boycott leaders promised vigilant retaliation for any Ameri can firm that did. 56 Protests, larger and smaller than the one on March 27, were repeated throughout the year and indeed throughout the life of the Third Reich. The stakes must have been high for Watson to disreg ard the gargan- tuan protest of a nation, and the world's battle cr y to isolate Germany com- mercially. But IBM maintained its steadfast commitm ent to an alliance with Nazi Germany. It was just days later that Watson la unched the effort to gar- ner the Prussian census contract. Germans understood Watson to be a friend of the Rei ch. Just after the Madison Square Garden event, senior management at D ehomag sent their company Leader a joindy signed appeal on firm lette rhead.

Heidinger could no t bring himself to capi- talize the l e t t e r \"J\" when typing the word \"German\" next to the word Jew. \"We are applying to our esteemed foreign personal a nd business friends,\" Dehomag wrote, \"with the most urgent request, not o nly to reciprocate our cooperation but—as champions of truth—not only not to believe similar unfounded rumors, but to set yourselves against the m.\" 57 Watson did not disappoint his colleagues in Berlin. Just after the world- wide r al li e s in late March, Dehomag board meetings in Berlin confirmed, \"President Watson and vice president Braitmayer wer e fully agreed that we should manufacture all suitable items in Germany ac cording to our best lights and by our own decision.\" Hence, plans to es tablish a factory were to proceed, even though certain highly technical parts would still be imported from the United States. Watson's office routinely r eceived translated copies of the meeting minutes a few days later. 58 Watson's commitment to growing German operations se emed indefati- gable. He ignored the tide of America's anti-Nazi m ovement and the risk of being discovered as a commercial associate of the T hird Reich. But doing so meant ignoring the inescapable financial risk any b usinessman could see in Nazi Germany. Simply put, doing business in Germany was dangerous. Foreign business was fundamentally considered an en emy of the Ger- man State. Incomes earned by foreign corporations c ould not be transferred overseas. They were sequestered in blocked German b ank accounts. The money was usable, but only in Germany. Hence, a dol lar of profit made by Dehomag could only be spent in Germany, binding any foreign enterprise to continued economic development within Germany. Comp anies were fre- quently required to invest their profits in Reich b onds. Many considered this monetary move little more than Hitler's effort to t ake American business hostage. Others understood that as corporations fle d Germany, the Reich was forced to decree that their money would have to remain behind. IBM's Paris office began regularly receiving statem ents from the Deutsche Bank und Disconto-Gesellschaft, listing De homag's distributions as blocked funds in the name of International Business Machines Corporation. For example, one account balance of RM 188,896 was suddenly boosted by RM 90,000—almost none of which could be sent back t o America. 59 Rapid-fire regulations designed to subdue the indep endence of foreign business were being promulgated almost daily.

Con flicting rules from conflic- ting authorities were commonplace. Most of all, Germany loudly warned all foreign busi ness that they were subject to a concept known as Gleichschaltung loose ly translated as \"total coordination\" with the State. Within days of Hitler 's rise to power, the process of Gleichschaltung began as every political , organizational, and social structure within German society was integrated into the Nazi movement and therefore made subordinate to NSDAP goals and instr uctions. Gleichschal- tung applied to business as well. Foreign business quickly realized it. And they were reminded often. 60 April 7, 1933, New York Times: A page one article b annered \"Nazis Seize Power to Rule Business; Our Firms Alarmed,\" led wit h the assertion, \"Adolf Hitler, having made himself political dictator of G ermany, today became dic- tator of German big business as well.\" The New York Times explained that, \"every phase of German business had already been th oroughly organized. By taking control of the business organizations, the N azis have obtained control of the interests they represent.\" 61 April 28, 1933, New York Times: In an article headl ined \"Germany Cau- tions Foreign Business,\" the newspaper prominendy r eported a promulgation by Reich Economics Undersecretary Paul Bang, \"The G erman government . . . must demand that foreign business establishme nts unreservedly partici- pate in the realization of Germany's economic progr am.\" 62 To complete the circle of apprehension, everywhere the talk was of re- newed war. Any economic transfusion to the Hitler r egime was seen by many as a mere prelude to another horrific military conf lict. Officials in Washing- ton, diplomats in London and Paris, and business le aders throughout the world feared that the advent of Hitler would throw humanity back into a global war. Signs of German rearmament were reporte d continuously. Open declarations by Germany that it would reoccupy trac ts of land seized by the victorious Allies were blared throughout the media. A key source of alarm was Hitler's so-called employment program. Germany was disarmed as part of the Versailles Trea ty. Now labor forces were becoming facades for military recruitme nt. Organized \"labor units\" were subject to conscription, wore uniforms, and underwent paramili- tary training. Typical was a New York Times report on May 21 headlined \"Reich Issues Orders for New Labor Units.\" The subh ead read, \"Military Tone Is Evident in the Conscription Regulations—Sto rm Troops Favored.\" 63 "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Why would one of America's leading businessmen and his premier cor- p o r a t i o n r i s k a l l b y p a r t i c i p a t i n g in a Nazi econom y sworn to destroy Jewry, subjugate Europe, and dominate all enterpris es within its midst? For one, IBM's economic entanglements with Nazi Germany rema ined beneath public perception. Few understood the far-reaching ramific ations of punch card technology and even fewer had a foreground understa nding that the com- pany Dehomag was in fact essentially a wholly-owned subsidiary of Interna- tional Business Machines. Boycott and protest movements were ardently trying to crush Hitlerism by stopping Germany's exports. Although a network o f Jewish and non- sectarian anti-Nazi leagues and bodies struggled to organize comprehensive lists of companies doing business with Germany, fro m importers of German toys and shoes to sellers of German porcelain and p harmaceuticals, yet IBM and Watson were not identified. Neither the company nor its president even appeared in any of thousands of hectic phone book e ntries or handwritten index card files of the leading national and region al boycott bodies. Anti- Nazi agitators just didn't understand the dynamics of corporate multi- nationalism. 64 Moreover, IBM was not importing German merchandise, it was export- ing machinery. In fact, even exports dwindled as so on as the new plant in Berlin was erected, leaving less of a paper trail. So a measure of invisibility was assured in 1933. But to a certain extent all the worries about grant ing Hitler the techno- logic tools he needed were all subordinated to one irrepressible, ideological imperative. Hitler's plans for a new Fascist order with a \"Greater Germany\" dominating all Europe were not unacceptable to Wats on. In fact, Watson admired the whole concept of Fascism. He hoped he c ould participate as the American capitalistic counterpart of the great Fasc ist wave sweeping the Con- tinent. Most of all, Fascism was good for business. THOMAS WATSON and IBM had separately and jointly spent decades ma king money any way they could. Rules were broken. Conspi racies were hatched. Bloody wars became mere market opportunities. To a supranational, making money is equal parts commercial Darwinism, corporat e ecclesiastics, dynastic chauvinism, and solipsistic greed. Watson was no Fascist. He was a pure capitalist.

Aft er all, his followers wore uniforms, sang songs, and were expected to dis play unquestioned loy- alty to the company he led. Fascism, the dictatorial state-controlled political system, was invented by Italian Dictator Benito Mussolini. The term symb olically derived from the Roman fasces, that is, the bundle of rods surroundi ng a ceremonial axe used during Roman times. Indeed, Nazi symbols and ritual were in large part adopted from Mussolini, including the palm-lifting Roman salute. Ironically, Italian Fascism was non-racial and not anti-Semitic . National Socialism added those defining elements. Mussolini fascinated Watson. Once, at a 1937 sales convention, Watson spoke out in Il Duce's defense. \"I want to pay trib ute ... [to the] great leader, Benito Mussolini,\" declared Watson. \"I have followe d the details of his work very carefully since he assumed leadership [in 1922 ]. Evidence of his leader- ship can be seen on all sides. . . . Mussolini is a pioneer . . . Italy is going to benefit gready.\" 65 Watson explained his personal attraction to the dic tator's style and even observed similarities with his own corporate, capit alistic model. \"One thing which has greatly impressed me in connection with h is leadership,\" con- ceded Watson, \"is the loyalty displayed by the peop le. To have the loyalty and cooperation of everyone means progress—and ultimate success for a nation or an individual business ... we should pay tribute to Mussolini for estab- lishing this spirit of loyal support and cooperatio n.\" 66 For years, an autographed picture of Mussolini grac ed the grand piano in Watson's living room. 67 In defense of Fascism, Watson made clear, \"Differen t countries require different forms of government and we should be care ful not to let people in other countries feel that we are trying to standard ize principles of govern- ment throughout the world.\" 68 Years after der Fuhrer seized power, Watson drafted a private letter to Reich Economics Minister Hjalmar Schacht, in which he argued \"the neces- sity of extending a sympathetic understanding to th e German people and their aims under the leadership of Adolf Hitler.\" W atson described Hitler's threatening posture toward other nations as a \"dyna mic policy.\" In referring to the \"heroic sacrifices of the German people and the greatest achievements of their present leadership,\" Watson declared, \"It is the sincere and earnest desire entertained by me and coundess other friends of Germany . . . that these sacrifices and achievements should be success ful and that the New Germany should reap the fruits of its present great effort to the fullest"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"extent.\" Watson concluded the draft with \"an expres sion of my highest esteem for himself [Hitler], his country and his pe ople.\" 69 W a t s o n was equally appreciated and admired by Fasci sts, especially in Germany. In its struggle with the democratic govern ments and popular movements that opposed Germany's anti-Semitic drive , Nazis gready valued their unexpected and influential ally. To them, it was a subde green light of quiet approval because Watson seemed, in the Nazi m entality, to speak for more than one American firm—he seemed to represent President Franklin D. Roosevelt and indeed America itself. The man who began his career as a turn-of-the-centu ry horse-and- buggy peddler had graduated to become America's num ber one private international statesman. Watson used charitable don ations to telescope his own importance. The roll call of honorary appointme nts of power and pres- tige was long and enviable. He was the chairman of the Carnegie Endow- ment for Peace, trustee of New York University, and chairman of the American section of the International Chamber of Co mmerce—and the lengthy gilded list proceeded from there. In fact, in the very days before the Reich awarded Dehomag the census contract, American newspapers promi- nently reported that Watson had been both nominated unopposed as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank and appointed trustee of Columbia University. 70 His access to Secretary of State Cordell Hull, and more importantly to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was unparalleled. While the Hoover Justice Department was at the height of its anti-trust inve stigation of IBM in 1932, Watson donated large sums to the Roosevelt campaign . Roosevelt's election over Hoover was a landslide. Watson now had entree to the White House itself. 71 Watson carefully curried favor with Roosevelt by pu blicly supporting some of his more controversial policies. Soon, Wats on was sending policy suggestions to the President. The two men began to correspond regularly. Watson was so proud of the letters, some of them me re presidential tokens, he would carry them around in a pocket, showing the m off when the moment would permit. 72 Soon, Roosevelt came to rely on Watson for advice. White House staffers would occasionally ask for Watson's schedu le in case the President needed to contact him quickly. Watson visited Hyde Park for tea several times and even stayed overnight at the White House. Eventually, Roosevelt offered to appoint Watson Secretary of Commerce or Ambassador to England. But Watson declined to leave IBM. 73 "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Instead Watson's son remembers, \"he served unofficially as Roosevelt 's representative in New York.\" If a foreign dignitary arrived, the White House might ask Watson to stage an honorary luncheon. \"Al l Father had to do was press a button,\" his son remembers. \"He had a whole department that did nothing but set up company dinners and other functi ons ... all at IBM ex- pense.\" Indeed, Roosevelt once remarked, \"I handle 'em in Washington and Tom handles 'em in New York.\" 74 Watson leveraged his position with the Administrati on to develop extensive contacts with Secretary of State Cordell Hull, numerous ambas- sadors and consuls, and the State Department in gen eral. Cloaked in official- dom, Watson never failed to undertake the often mon ths-long process of formally soliciting official greetings to private f unctions from Roosevelt, Hull, or other Administration luminaries. These letters, often gratuitous, broadcast arcs of power to those observing overseas, especial ly in a Reich that believed in bigger-than-life personages. No wonder Nazi Germany considered Watson a very pow erful friend. Indeed, when in October 1933 Dehomag encountered un expectedly high customs duties on IBM machinery it hoped to import as part of its new expanded portfolio, Heidinger wrote a thinly veiled threat to Reich Customs bureaucrats. \"The president of our American co-asso ciate, the International Business Machines . . . Mr. Watson, is one of the m ost prominent American personalities,\" asserted Heidinger. \"Among other th ings, he is one of the well-known 25 intimate counselors of President Roos evelt, president of the New York Chamber of Commerce . . . he also holds many , many other posi- tions of honor in the United States. In keeping wit h his friendliness for Ger- many, proven at all times, he has up to now done ev erything possible which appeared to be to the interest of Germany. I am qui te sure that Mr. Watson would never understand ... a country to raise suppl ementary customs . . . on his machines.\" Heidinger added, \"I do not know w hat the attitude of the above-named would be if the customs increase we re permitted. I am recommending,\" Heidinger concluded, \"that the ab ove facts be placed to the knowledge of the two gentlemen [customs officer s] examining the situation.\" 75 Watson did everything he could to reinforce in Germ any his image of special American potency and friendship. The German consul in New York was a houseguest at Watson's home, and Watson insis ted on arranging for him complimentary country club privileges at the IB M Country Club. His socializing with the German Ambassador was equally robust, making certain that special invitations for luncheons and dinners were regularly circulated"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"to German diplomats, and punctual acceptance or gra cious regrets were sent in response to heirs. 76 So a happy medium was found between Watson's de sire to maintain deniability in IBM's lucrative relations with Germa ny and his personal desire to hobnob with Third Reich VIPs. But, the demands o f the growing business in Germany would not be free of Watson's famous mic ro-management. Too much was at stake. Watson would travel to Germany regularly during the thirties for first- hand information about the situation in the Nazi Re ich. These visits would be augmented by his personal New York representativ es who would monitor Dehomag on-site for months at a time. Verbatim tran slations of Dehomag's voluminous memos, correspondence, even routine bure aucratic forms and applications, were continuously transmitted to IBM in New York for review and comment. Watson had created the IBM Europe office, headquart ering it in Paris and then Geneva, to function as the eyes and ears o f the New York office in Europe. When Watson's personal representatives were not in Germany, contin- uous upervision of Dehomag was effected by executiv es in the Swiss branch of IBM, and often the Paris office. More than just routine oversight of the German operation, the Swiss office of IBM would bec ome the all-important nexus for instructions, profit funneling, and conti nent-wide coordination in support of Dehomag's technologic activities thro ughout Europe. The com- bination of Watson's micro-management from afar and persistent Swiss examination gave IBM an ever-present hour-to-hour g rasp of the smallest operational details at Dehomag, from miniscule bank discrepancies amount- ing to just a few dollars to the most vital issues facing the subsidiary's rela- tions with the Nazi regime. From the very first moments and continuing througho ut the twelve- year existence of the Third Reich, IBM placed its t echnology at the disposal of Hitler's program of Jewish destruction and terri torial domination. IBM did not invent Germany's anti-Semitism, but when it volunteered solutions, the company virtually braided with Nazism. Like any technologic evolution, each new solution powered a new level of sinister e xpectation and cruel capability. When Germany wanted to identify the Jews by name, I BM showed them how. When Germany wanted to use that informati on to launch pro- grams of social expulsion and expropriation, IBM pr ovided the technologic wherewithal. When the trains needed to run on time, from city to city or between concentration camps, IBM offered that solut ion as well.

Even as German Jewry hid in their homes and wept in despair , even as the world quietly trembled in fear, there was singing.

BITTER AND defiant, Heidinger saw Watson as the incarnatio n of the financial calamity that had befallen Germany after the Great War. Heidinger had possessed the vision in 1910 to intro duce Hollerith's contraption into Germany. He founded a company, Dehomag, to bri ng data processing to his country. But for the monetary manipulations tha t arose after World War I, the Diktat of the Versailles Treaty, and the wild e nsuing hyperinflation of the twenties, Heidinger would still own that company. 1 Back in 1922, worthless German currency was devalue d by the hour. Heidinger was unable to remit some $104,0 00 in royalties in CTR, the IBM predecessor company, because it amo unted to trillions of inflated Reiehsmarks that were imposs ible to obtain. Watson seized upon Germany's inflation crisis to ta ke possession of Dehomag. Daring contentious negotiations, Watson fi rst offered to demur on the royalty debt in exchange for 51 percen t of the com- pany. Heidinger felt it was better to own nearly ha lf of a going con- cern than all of a bankrupt one. So he agreed to yi eld half of Dehomag. But then Watson abrupdy upped the demand f rom 51 percent of Dehomag to 90 percent. Heidinger felt \"c ornered\" by his own private Diktat. Under Watson's new terms, Heidi nger would own 10 percent—or nothing. Watson had outmaneuvered Hei dinger. 2 "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"It was more than a decade earlier. But Heidinger ne ver forgot it. The spent the rest of his career biting back. Watson, on the other hand, was a steel-nerved busin essman. He saw the Dehomag takeover of 1922 as just another opportunit y to swoop up a lucra- tive business for virtually nothing. What could be more natural? Hating a business contact was of no use to a man like Watson . Heidinger merely rep- resented a factor to control in the pursuit of prof its. But Heidinger was woven from too much feisty fabric . His austere face pulled tight over high cheekbones beneath a worried brow framed the very picture of contentiousness. \"I would be the last to submit to domina- tion,\" Heidinger wrote to IBM's Nazi oversight pane l in recalling his dislike for Watson. \"I do not, as a matter of principle, le t anyone tell me to do anything.\" 3 Warlike in his business demeanor, Heidinger enjoyed corporate combat and tenacious lawsuits. He could litigate a narrow commercial issue for years and obstruct a crucial company program at the eleve nth hour unless he received his due. Like Hollerith himself, Heidinger was willing to battle col- leagues as well as adversaries. An IBM assessment o f Heidinger termed him a \"hardened survivor\" whose \"life .. . was not a se rene one.\" The description added, \"He throve on fights.\" 4 More than just volatile and unpredictable, no one a t IBM trusted Hei- dinger. Company executives constantly suspected him of chiseling IBM for small and large sums, and thwarting their routine a udits to identify the amounts. \"Mr. Heidinger is a very selfish man,\" wro te one IBM auditor who in spring 1934 tried to verify Dehomag's tax inform ation. At about that time, another IBM auditor in Paris reported back to the N ew York office, \"Just in order to avoid any misunderstanding, we wish to adv ise that we are not aware of what is taking place . . . insofar as the recording of the inventories and the closing of the books is concerned.\" The com pany's staid blue-suited accountants learned to be reluctant in approaching Heidinger less they incur his volcanic temper. In that vein, another auditor, also writing in spring 1934, complained, \"it is practically impossible to do any thing by correspondence, due to the fear of unduly exciting our German frien ds.\" 5 Even before Hitler seized power, IBM had profited e normously from Dehomag. By 1927, profits had returned more than 40 0 percent of IBM's purchase price. 6 Now, as part of the Third Reich's industrial team, Dehomag's future was catapulting. Nazi demands for a universe of punch card applica- tions promised horizonless profits. Merged IBM enti ties, a Europe-wide ter- ritory, and a new factory presaged a magnificent ne w Dehomag whose"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"fortune would rise along with the fortune of the Th ird Reich. Yet who would prosper? Would it be the German people? the Aryan r ace? Heidinger person- ally? No. It would be Watson and IBM. Heidinger roi led at the prospect. Normally, Watson would not tolerate even a spark of rebellious man- agement, let alone continuous insolent defiance. It was indeed a measure of Dehomag's indispensable importance to IBM's long-ra nge global goals that the micro-managing, egocentric Watson would endure clash after clash with his own executives in Germany. Likewise, Heidinger was resourceful and energetic enough to walk away from any distasteful foreign enterprise and pursue his own commercial dominion. In truth, the t wo men desperately needed each oilier. Watson needed Heidinger's connections to the NSDAP to turn Nazi plans into IBM profits. And he needed Heidinger's c ooperation if those profits were to discreetly detour around the Reich payment moratorium. One method was requiring its own German subsidiary to p ay IBM \"royalties.\" Revenues could then be deemed a \"necessary expense\" to Dehomag rather than a profit to the parent company. Dehomag monies could occasionally be transmitted to IBM in this form. As IBM's European manager reassured New York executives in a 1934 letter, Dehomag Manager H erman Rottke promised to \"pull every wire and use every effort to continu e [royalty] payments.\" 7 For Heidinger's part, he needed Watson to arm the s tatistical soldiers of the Third Reich for the coming war against European Jewry and territorial conquest. For now, the machines would still be impo rted from the United States. But even after the new factory was rushed i nto operation, allowing Hollerith machines to be manufactured in Berlin, th e precious punch cards themelves, painstakingly produced to an exacting sp ecification, could still be ordered from only one source: IBM in the United States. Both men would vault their tempers and stratagems a cross the Atlantic as Heidinger labored to expand Dehomag's commercial cooperation with the Third Reich, and Watson struggled to retain all the profits, often cutting Hei- dinger out. To achieve his goals, each man had to cooperate in an international campaign of corporate schizophrenia designed to ach ieve maximum deniability for both Dehomag and IBM. The storyline depended up on the circumstance and the listener. Dehomag could be portrayed as the American-controlled, al- most wholly-owned subsidiary of IBM with token Germ an shareholders and on-site German managers. Or Dehomag could be a loya l German, staunchly Aryan company baptized in the blood of Nazi ideolog y wielding the power of its American investment for the greater glory of Hitler's Reich. Indeed,"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Heidinger and Watson both were willing to wave eith er banner as needed. Both stories were true. Watson had seen to that. Dehomag's Aryan facade was carefully constructed. I n newly Nazified Germany, many good and decent businessmen looked th e other way, dread- ing the day stern-faced men sporting swastika armba nds knocked on the door demanding anti-Semitic loyalty oaths, subscrip tions of financial sup- port, and ultimately invasive Party control via kom missars. At the same time, some could not wait to join the movement. Dehomag w as among those who could not wait. IBM was among those who did not min d. Early on, Heidinger sought out the sponsorship of t he Nazi Party hier- archy. He wanted Dehomag draped in the authority no t only of the govern- ment but the Nazi Party itself. However, before the NSDAP would ally with Dehomag, the powerful Political and Economics Divis ion demanded, in December 1933, that the company answer some pointed questions. The Party's probe was designed to detect just who contr olled the corporation, whether the firm was German enough, Nazi enough, an d strategic enough to receive the Party's seal of approval. 8 Heidinger proffered incisive, if dubious, written r eplies. \"My company is an entirely independent organization which has a cquired patent rights from their American owners,\" he insisted, and is me rely bound to pay \"royal- ties.\" But, argued Heidinger, \"any worries as to wh ether or not excessive amounts of German funds are being exported are thor oughly unjustified,\" especially since most of the royalties remained in blocked German bank accounts until released by the government. 9 One Party question inquired why Dehomag could not s ell any wholly German-built office equipment instead of American p roducts. Heidinger explained that the Reich could not achieve its goal s without Hollerith tabula- tors. \"[A]side from ours, no other punched card mac hinery is manufactured in Germany,\" asserted Heidinger, adding, \"Our machi nes cannot possibly displace other machines, because the work they are called upon to perform cannot be accomplished by the other machines.\" 10 Heidinger concluded his written comments by remindi ng the Party examiners that Dehomag had been \"entrusted . . . wi th the compilation of statistics for the Prussian census.\" He added knowi ngly, with that air of omi- nous lack of specificity so common in those days, \" Moreover, negotiations are now pending in Berlin, their object being an ag reement between my company and the SA [Storm Troopers] high command in that city for the compilation of certain necessary statistics.\" 11 Nothing more need be said. Dehomag was approved."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Verbatim translations of the NSDAP's questions and Heidinger's answers - along with the German originals—were delivered to the New York office within several business days for review by Watson a nd other IBM executives. 12 New York agreed with a sub-rosa approach if it coul d garner the Nazi Party affiliation needed to secure more government contracts. IBM willingly diminished its own identity as part of the effort. New York executives were advised of a Dehomag request: \"in the future, on al l machines shipped to them [Dehomag], the following designations are to b e omitted: 1) Interna- tional Business Machines, 2) International.\" A 1934 memo from IBM's Paris managers didn't even want IBM billed for small Germ an registration fees, explaining, \"we all should be very careful in explo iting or advertising the name of IBM Corp. in Germany.\" 13 Watson himself would continue his high visibility, but would be portrayed during his frequ ent visits not as a foreign controller of Dehomag as much as a supporter of IBM technology in Nazi Germany. Heidinger's assertions of allegiance to Nazi ethics and independence from foreign influence were certainly acceptable to IBM in New York—so long as everyone in the company understood the trut h: Watson remained in charge. To ensure that Watson in fact retained full control of Dehomag's activities, IBM NY insisted on several provisions. First , Dehomag by-laws would allow New York to supe rcede the German board of directors at any time. Dehomag's corporate by-laws five and six de- clared that the corporation would be comprised not only of shareholders and a board of directors, but of an unusual third compone nt: \"representatives and attorneys—in-fact... determined by the shareholders .\" These would be IBM accountants, managers, and lawyers who could projec t Watson's authority on a day-to-day basis. The fifth by-law added, \"The shar eholders shall be in a po- sition to annul the board of directors.\" By-law sev en ordered, \"The represen- tatives [Watson's attorneys and accountants] shall follow the instructions of the shareholders and the board of directors, if the re is one.\" 14 Second, Heidinger's token 10 percent share of the D ehomag were his to own, but only so long as he remained with the co mpany. The stock could not be sold without the shareholders' permission, a ccording to by-law four. 15 Clearly, the power at Dehomag was wielded by the sh areholders. Wat- son and IBM NY owned 90 percent of the stock. This gave Watson and his attorneys veto power over any Dehomag activity and indeed over Heidinger himself.

Holt, who mainly operated out of IBM's Gene va office. 16 Heidinger acquiesced to the concept of foreign control, but h e resented Watson's inter- ference. The first test came quickly. It involved G erman Sales Manager Karl Hummel. Watson had cultivated a personal alliance with Humm el. He had ar- ranged for Hummel to attend IBM's sales training sc hool at Endicott, New York, and entertained Hummel and his wife in his ho me. The Hummels and Watsons periodically exchanged gifts. Watson knew h ow to develop loyalty. He wanted Hummel on the German board. December 15, 1933, Watson made his move, sending a radiogram to Dehomag Gener al Manager Her- mann Rottke: \"To give Dehomag fuller representation in Germany, I request that Karl Hummel be made second director (Geschafts fuhrer) and his name so listed. . . . Kindly notify me when this is done .\" 17 Watson had not asked Heidinger first. Heidinger erupted, and just days before the new fac tory was to open in a grand ceremony, Rottke cabled back: \"According to German law, not I but only shareholders meeting and board of direct ors have authority to promote Karl Hummel . . . sending your cable and a copy of this answer to Heidinger.\" 18 Sarcastic and threatening, Heidinger on December 20 dashed off a warning to Watson. \"I do not seriously fear ... you r positive will in the future to put me aside in questions of importance for the Dehomag. Nevertheless, I of course feel deeply depressed that you are not in terested to hear my opin- ion [about] ... such an important decision.... That feeling of depression ... might be considered as not important. But what coul d be important is the following. 19 \"As you know,\" Heidinger continued, \"we all conside red it of greatest importance to proof [sic] that the Dehomag is a Ger man-managed company ... free from American influence . . . our authorit ies are very sensitive if they should believe to be fouled.\" He hinted that the Na zi Party might feel the need to install two of its own kommissars on the bo ard. During a recent con- ference at the Nazi Party headquarters, Heidinger h ad reassured ranking officials that Dehomag would function free of Ameri can influence. Now the Hummel appointment was showing the opposite, he cla imed, adding that Watson's move would \"shock\" Party stalwarts and cre ate a \"dangerous\" situa- tion for the company. 20 Watson went into damage control mode. Upon receivin g Heidinger's irk-"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"some missive, he cabled Rottke, who would soon sail to America lor meetings at IBM: \"Do nothing further about Hummel until I se e you in New York.\" 21 It was difficult, but Watson humbled himself. In a rambling, two-page letter filled with spelling errors, Watson apologiz ed over and over again, regretted Heidinger's upset, professed his unqualif ied friendship to Ger- many, recalled his pleasant times in Berlin, enumer ated his forthcoming din- ner engagements with the German ambassador, and sta unchly assured, \"you have nothing to worry about in connection with the German government, so far as my connection with our German business is co ncerned.\" Watson blamed not his lack of respect for Heidinger, but a simple typo. In his origi- nal cablegram asking for Hummel's appointment, Wats on averred, \"one word was misquoted. The cablegram dictated was 'I sugges t,' and I find in the copy it was written \"request' ... it is always my policy ... to make a suggestion, rather than a request.\" 22 Suggest. Not request. Unappeased, Heidinger shot back in a melodramatic f lourish, \"it was a real and great joy for me to receive your letter . . . [and] to see that the biggest part of the trouble arose from the mistake of using the word 'request' instead [of] 'suggest' which ... formally settles t he most dangerous point. .. I hardly can express how happy I am about the frien dly manner in which you explain... the mistaken wording of your cable.\" 23 Heidinger's message was cabled to Rottke, who at th at moment was steaming across the Atlantic on the SS President Ro osevelt. Rottke had the cable retyped on letterhead and handed it to Watson once he landed in New York. Hummel, it was decided, would be promoted to senior management, but not sit on the board. The conflict was over. Wa tson filed his original dic- tation copy of that December cablegram to Rottke. O n line two the word \"request\" was originally typed. Watson edited the cable, scratched out \"request\" but then upon reflection wrote it back in by hand and signed it. \"Suggest\" was never in the document. It was always \"request.\" 24 JANUARY_8,1934. In a corner of Dehomag's vast punch card operation within the great Karstadthaus census complex at Berlin's Alexanderpl atz, with morning light streaming in behind them through banks of tall para llel windows, several dozen officials of the Prussian Statistical Office were joined by leaders of the Nazi Party in full uniform and Dehomag officials in their finest suits to "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"solemnly recognize the coming revolution of data pr ocessing and the newly forged a l l i a n c e with International Business Machine s. 25 Hands reverently clasped either behind their backs or across their belt buckles, shoulders and arms touching in fellowship, the assemblage stood in awe of this day, the day Germany would unveil its o wn factory producing Hollerith machines. The President of the Prussian S tatistical Office, Dr. Hop- ker, delivered brief remarks using the euphemisms a nd crystal clear ambigui- ties of the day. \"[T]he irresistible force of the N ational Socialist government . . . demands the [census] results faster than ever before,\" he declared, adding, \"German statistics understands this impatie nce.\" He then explained exactly how the punch card process worked, distilli ng the anonymous Ger- man masses into specific names organized by race an d religion, as well as numerous other characteristics. 26 Accompanied by a dense din in adjacent halls that c licked and whirred like locusts swarming a field, Heidinger stepped to the front to speak. With the passion of a die-hard ideologist simultaneously presenting an omnipotent gift to the nation and fulfilling a life-long perso nal dream, he spoke of the demographic surgery the German population required. \"The physician examines the human body and determin es whether ... all organs are working to the benefit of the entire organism,\" asserted Hei- dinger to a crowd of company employees and Nazi off icials. \"We [Dehomag] are very much like the physician, in that we dissec t, cell by cell, the German cultural body. We report every individual character istic ... on a little card. These are not dead cards, quite to the contrary, th ey prove later on that they come to life when the cards are sorted at a rate of 25,000 per hour according to certain characteristics. These characteristics a re grouped like the organs of our cultural body, and they will be calculated and determined with the help of our tabulating machine. 27 \"We are proud that we may assist in such a task, a task that provides our nation's Physician [Adolf Hitler] with the material he needs for his examina- tions. Our Physician can then determine whether the calculated values are in harmony with the health of our people. It also mean s that if such is not the case, our Physician can take corrective procedures to correct the sick circum- stances. . . . Our characteristics are deeply roote d in our race. Therefore, we must cherish them like a holy shrine, which we will —and must—keep pure.

At 10:30, Dehomag employees stop ped th e i r work to gather for the great event. Tall trees along the perimeter were still nearly barren from the Berlin winter. The swastika-bedecked squar e in front of the four- story factory complex was already jammed with hundr eds of neighborhood onlookers and well wishers. 29 Just before noon, two columns of Storm Troopers too k up positions along either side of the walkway leading to Dehomag 's front door. A band from the SA's 9th Regiment played Nazi victory song s. Finally, the NSDAP hierarchy arrived. 30 Dehomag had invited Nazi higher-ups representing th e organizations most important to the future of IBM's partnership w ith the Third Reich. From the German Labor Front came Rudolf Schmeer, a last-minute stand-in for Dr. Robert Ley, leader of the organization. The German Labor Front was the militant coalition responsible for mobilizing u nemployed Nazi millions into both newly created jobs and vacated Jewish pos itions. The Front also inducted Germans into regimented squads that functi oned as veritable mili- tary units. So important was Dr. Ley and his German Labor Front that the entire Lichterfelde factory opening was delayed two days because he took ill. Only when it became clear he would not recover for days was the event sud- denly rescheduled with Schmeer, accompanied by an e ntourage of poten- tates, standing in. 31 At Schmeer's side was A. Gorlitzer representing the SA, the rough and ready Storm Troopers, the violent edge of Hitler's forces. Gorlitzer was a powerful Nazi. When Goebbels became Propaganda Mini ster, Gorlitzer took his place in the Storm Trooper organization. Now, t he presence of Gorlitzer, in gleaming, black leather boots and fighting unifo rm, would testify to the importance of Dehomag in Hitler's future plans. 32 As the invited Nazi officials paraded through echel ons of honor guard, the Brown Shirts pumped their arms rigidly diagonal . Schmeer, Gorlitzer, and the other leaders returned the disciplined Hitl er salute with a casual, almost cocky bent-elbowed gesture, their open palms barely wafting over their shoulder. 33 Bouquets decorated Dehomag's reception hall. One l arge swastika emblem dominated the front of the podium, and an ev en larger swastika flag hung across the wall. Music inside was provided by an NSDAP men's choir. To record the event, a tall, circular microphone st ood nearby. 34 The company's most important users were there as we ll.

So many trains. The men and organization s assembled would help shape that future in ways people were only beginnin g to imagine. Representing Watson at the event was his personal representative , Walter Jones. Jones was the Paris-based manager of all European operations and a man who would one day become chairman of IBM Canada. 36 Framed by swastikas front and rear, a clearly impre ssed Jones was the first to speak. He proclaimed in German, \"It is an outstanding honor and privilege for me to be with you and to represent Mr . Thomas J. Watson, pres- ident of International Business Machines, on the oc casion of the formal opening of this magnificent factory . . . the new a nd permanent home of Dehomag.\" 37 Repeatedly using Nazi buzzwords for economic recove ry, Jones made clear that Mr. Watson agreed to the new constructio n \"because he realized your organization had outgrown the facilities . . . [and] the time was propi- tious ... as it would give employment to many idle workmen and thus help . . . the unemployed.\" Peppering Watson's name and imprimatur throughout his address, Jones praised, \"the noble work underta ken by your government in its aim to give work to every German citizen.\" 38 When Heidinger came to the front, nattily dressed w ith a small hand- kerchief peeking from his suit jacket pocket, the m an was clearly emotional. \"I feel it almost a sacred action, if in this hour I consecrate this place of our mother earth,\" he began. Reviewing Dehomag's tu rbulent history, he described how the tiny company had persevered despi te a lack of financing, the Great War, and the suffocating post-War inflati on. 39 Although at that very time, Heidinger was battling Watson over the appointment of Hummel, in this moment of Nazi fulfi llment, Heidinger was effusive. Recalling IBM's acquisition of Dehomag, h e recast the story not as an acrimonious takeover but as a financial rescue b y a benevolent friend of the German people. \"I express our deepest appreciat ion and our thanks for, the noblesse not to be surpassed, proved by our cre ditor . . . International Business Machines Corporation under the management of their president, Thomas J. Watson, in our condition of distress.... [IBM] could have been in a position to take over our entire firm by . . . en forcing their claim for bank- ruptcy ... but [instead] purchased a share in our c ompany.\" 40 "},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Continually invoking Nazi re employment cliches, He idinger promised that Dehomag would provide \"bread and work\" for Ger man citizens. In that vein, he said that IBM had calculated the cost of a grand opening banquet and instead would contribute the 10,000 Reichsmarks to the Winter Subsidy, a Nazi program donating funds and food to those thr own into deeper job- lessness by the international anti-Nazi boycott. 41 He concluded by unveiling a building plaque commemo rating the fac- tory both to \"the national awakening of the German people\" and to its future. Heidinger concluded by asking that \"the ble ssing of heaven may rest upon this place.\" 42 Final remarks were offered by Schmeer on behalf of the powerful Ger- man Labor Front. \"German men, German women,\" he pro claimed, \"the fact that we are on the way up under Hitler's leadership despite the present condi- tions was doubted by many, not just by our enemies, but also by people who were willing to work honestly and diligently. The o pening of this factory . . . shows that the road Hitler has prescribed and which he took last year was right, namely to bring trust into the German econom y. People in the past were not lacking commitment to hard work but they lacked trust . . . the Volks community now present in this factory is here to st ay, and stay for all eter- nity... It will produce goods, which will help our people in their ascent.\" 43 Snapping into respect, Schmeer pumped his arm forwa rd exclaiming, \"I now ask you to collect our joy and cry out: 'Our Fu hrer, Adolf Hitler, Sieg Heil!'\" The crowd reciprocated with fire: Sieg Heil ! The choir burst into the national anthem, \"Deutschland uber Alles.\" 44 Marching out enthusiastic and reassured, swept into the moment, the regaled Brown Shirts chanted the \"Horst Wessel Song .\" 45 Soon Hitler's flags will wave Over every single street Enslavement ends When soon we set things right! For IBM and Dehomag both, it was an extraordinary d ay of Nazi com- munion. Two days later, Jones sent off verbatim tra nslations of the speeches to Watson with an enthusiastic cover letter declari ng, \"as your representative, I attended the formal opening . . . I have never witn essed a more interesting ceremony.\" Jones attached a fist of all the Nazi fi gures that attended, and even made clear that the dignitaries included the S A's \"Gorlitzer, who suc- ceeded Dr. Goebbels in the latter's former position .\" Jones' letter proudly"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"mentioned \"a full company of Nazi storm troups [ sic] with band\" and promised IBM's Leader that plenty of photos would f ollow. 46 Watson sent a personal letter to Heidinger. \"Mr. Jo nes sent me a copy of the speech you made at the opening of the new facto ry in Berlin . . . and I have read it with a great deal of interest. .. you are certainly to be congratu- lated upon the manner in which you conveyed your th oughts.\" The company was so proud of the event that Dehomag printed comm emorative programs of the event with photographs and transcripts of th e speeches made at both the census complex and the factory. 47 There was no turning back now. IBM and the Nazi par ty had bonded. Swastikas and corporate slogans had found their com mon ground. Day and night, the Jewish names clattered through IBM syste ms, faster and faster, city by city, profession by profession. Dehomag was the Third Reich's informa- tional deliverer. As such, they were afforded a spe cial place in the mindset of Nazi planners. It was an awesome responsibility for Dehomag and IBM, but one they accepted with doctrinaire devotion. The feeling was captured by one Nazi newspaper, Der Deutsche, which sent a reporter to cover the Lichterfelde ceremonie s. The paper quoted Hei- dinger on the nature of the company. Heidinger expl ained it this way: \"Chil- dren's character is determined by their parents. Fi rms' by their founders.\" 48 G ERMANY WAS quietly tabulating. While Hitler's rhetoric was burning the parade grou nds and airwaves, while Storm Troopers were marching Jews through the streets in ritual humiliations, while Reich legislative decrees and a miasma of regional and private policies were ousting Jews from their profe ssions and residences, while noisy, outrageous acts of persecution were ap palling the world, a qui- eter process was also underway. Germany was automat ing. Hollerith systems could do more than count. They co uld schedule, ana- lyze, and compute. They could manage. Several dozen Hollerith systems were already in use by a small clique of German industrial firms and government offices. 49 But now Hitler's Reich discovered that in its quest for supremacy, it coul d mechanize, organize, and control virtually all aspects of private and commer cial life, from the largest industrial cartel to the humblest local shopkeeper. Just as people would be categorized and regimented down to the least charac teristic, so would all of German business be analyzed to the smallest detail— and then subject to"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Nazi discipline. The economy could recover. People could go back to work. But it would all he done toward a single, totally c oordinated Nazi goal. A global movement was loudly organizing to shatter the German econ- omy and topple the repressive Hitler regime by deny ing economic recovery, prolonging German joblessness, and boycotting Germa n commerce. But IBM was mobilizing its financial and engineering might to do the opposite. Gen- eral Manager Rottke echoed IBM's attitude at the Li chterfelde factory open- ing, declaring, \"We are able to hereby assist our g overnment in its battle against unemployment.\" Work and bread was the theme IBM and Dehomag used again and again to describe their venture—all in support of the National Socialist goal. As Heidinger told his audi ence, \"Public interest pre- vails over private interest.\" 50 Hollerith technology had become a German administra tive way of life, Punch cards would enable the entire Reich to go on a war footing. For IBM, it was a bonanza. Dehomag's client list sparkled. Electrical combines such as Siemens in Berlin and Lech-Elektrizitatswerke in Augsburg. Hea vy industry such as Mannesmann in Diisseldorf and I.G. Farben in Frankf urt. Automakers such as Opel in Russelsheim and Daimler-Benz in Stuttgar t. Retail stores such as Woolworth and Hertie in Berlin. Optical manufacture rs such as Zeiss in Jena and Zeiss Ikon in Dresden. Chocolate factories such as Schokoladenfabrik in Tangermunde. Coffee producers such as Kaffee Handel s A.G. in Bremen. 51 Aircraft engines: 10 customers; coal mining: 7 cust omers; chemical plants: 18 customers; electrical products: 10 customers; mo tor vehicle industry: 11 customers; shipbuilders: 2 customers; railroads, bu ses, trams, and other trans- portation: 32 customers; insurance companies: 26 cu stomers; banks: 6 cus- TOMERS ; public utilities: 16 customers; iron and steel: 19 customers; turbines, engines, and tractors: 7 customers. 52 Leather tanning, washing machine manufacture, liquo r, paint and var- nishes, cigarettes, perfumes, railway car assembly, ball bearings, rubber, petroleum, shoes, oleomargarine, asbestos, explosiv es. 53 Reichspost, Reichsbahn, Pension Funds, the Luftwaff e, the Navy. 54 Payroll, inventory control, material strength calcu lations, personnel, finance, scheduling, product usage, and manufacturi ng supervision. 55 There was virtually no business that could not benefit fr om punch card technology. Dehomag deftly controlled the data operations of th e entire Reich. Moreover, one Dehomag customer account could repres ent dozens of machines. Hollerith systems involved an ensemble of interconnected devices"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"that could be manufactured in a variety of configur ations. Punchers, proofers, verifiers, sorters, tabulators, alphabetizers, mult ipliers, printers. I.G. Farben installed arrays in Offenbach, Bitterfeld, Berlin, Hoechst, and other locations. Daimler-Benz utilized machines in Berlin, Stuttgart , Genshagen, and other sites. Junkers employed Hollerith devices in Magdeburg, Le opoldshall, Kothen, Dessau, and numerous other cities. Municipalities e verywhere used the ma- chines. Frankfurt am Main's Public Works Department alone maintained an ex- tended suite of punchers, verifiers, tabulators, mu ltipliers, and sorters. Statistical offices—federal, regional, and local—could not leas e enough systems. 56 Gleichschaltung, that is, total central coordinatio n, demanded that end- less accountings be submitted regularly to governme nt bureaus, Nazified trade associations, and statistical agencies. Kommi ssars and government regu- lations required companies to install Hollerith mac hines to ensure prompt, uniform, up-to-the-minute reports that could be rep rocessed and further tab- ulated. The Reich Statistical Office's Department I was officially charged with the responsibility of helping companies transition to the elaborate Hollerith methodology. Statistical bureaus hired thousands of new staffers just to keep up with the data flow. 57 Hitler's Germany began achieving undreamed of effic iencies. The Reichsbahn was a vital customer for Dehomag, deploy ing full or partial sys- tems in Essen, Cologne, Nuremberg, Mainz, Frankfurt , Hannover, and nearly every other major connection point. Some 140 millio n passengers annually were booked through Dehomag card sorting systems. P unch cards made the trains run on time and even evaluated engine effici ency when pulling certain types of freight. Records in some railway operation s that previously required 300 people six months to organize could now be comp uted by a staff of fifteen working for just a week. 58 Customers such as Krupp, Siemens, and the Deutsche Bank were able to reduce their operating costs and clerical staffs by as much as half, and plow those human and financial resources into sella ble goods and services. Manpower could be shifted as needed from plant to p lant by companies and deployed from city to city by the German Labor Fron t. 59 To meet fast-expanding demand, Dehomag hired more t han 1,000 new employees to staff the new factory at Lichterfelde. Everywhere throughout the plant, newly installed machine tools were fabri cating Hollerith devices. Workshops buzzed, cranked, and whirred with Beling & Lubke precision lathes, Jung surface grinders, Boley milling machin es, Hille high-speed drills, Auerbach & Scheibe 3-spindle drill presses, Thiel m etal saws, Karger thread- cutting lathes, and Universal grinding machines. 60 Metal shavings, oil cans,"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"iron rods, tin coils, ball bearings, alloy sheets, and rubber rollers combined with bent elbows, squinting eyes, wedging bands and brows wiped by the sleeves of work smocks to create a manufacturing mi racle. IBM zeal and Nazi devotion coalesced to help the Reich recover and st rengthen. Lichterfelde was overwhelmed with orders. It establ ished a \"shock department\" for the speedy manufacture of spare par ts, retrofitted an old disused IBM plant from pre-merger days, and convert ed it to a workshop. Outside storage, some 1,200 square meters costing m ore than RM 12,000 annually, was rented. Workmen shutded materials bac k and forth from the storage site to the overcrowded Lichterfelde site w here even corridor space was at a premium. \"Our own workshops (technical) gr ew to such an extent,\" complained Heidinger in a report to IBM NY, \"that e very square meter of space was overfilling with machines and persons, an d the acute shortage of space became more and more critical.\" 61 Dehomag's explosive growth arose not only from a di ctatorial mar- shalling of all commerce, but also because of a com pletely new industry within Nazi Germany: race science. Identifying who was a Jew—either by certifying Aryan lineage or exposing Jewish ancestr y became big business overnight. Hollerith alone possessed the technology to efficiendy provide the answers Nazi raceologists craved. RACE SCIENCE , rooted in the international Eugenics movement, had long been a pseudo-scientific discipline within the Nazi culture. In Germany, the field transformed from vague debates into a lucrati ve reality when two fac- tors converged. It began when a multiplicity of ant i-Jewish decrees and pri- vate provisos demanded Jewish ousters and pure Arya n descent. But these racist requirements clashed with what Dehomag had e xposed when it com- puled the 1933 census: not all the Jews could be id entified by a mere census. Census tabulations isolated nearly a half million J ews, less than 1 per- cent of the overall German population, and 65,000 l ess than the previous national census in 1925. Reich statisticians saw th is drop as validation that \"the new political order had induced a strong emigr ation trend.\" But in the Nazi mindset, the half million identified were mere ly the most obvious Jew- ish layer, the so-called \"practicing Jews.\" 62 Nazi ideology defined Jewishness not as a function of religious prac- tice, but bloodline. How far back? Nazi theoreticia ns debated tracing parent- age. Some looked at grandparents. Some suggested se arching back four generations. Still others focused on the year 1800, before Jewish emancipa- tion, that is, before assimilation into German soci ety. 63 "},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Reich statisticians concluded from t h e occupational y i e l d s of the Deho- mag census that \"there are quite a number of Jews i n these 'independent occupations' who have left the community of the Jew ish faith. Those 'Jews' could not be recorded as Jews in the 1933 Census. T hat means that Jewish infiltration into our cultural life is probably muc h greater than the numbers for practicing Jews would otherwise indicate.\" 64 Estimates of how many ancestral Jews, baptized or n ot, really dwelled within the Reich ranged far above the traditional 6 00,000. But no one knew just how many. Nazi raceologists devised a bizarre pseudo-mathematical for- mula that grouped ancestral Jews into a series of g rades, such as fully Jewish, half-Jewish, and quarter-Jewish, depending upon how many Jewish parents and grandparents could be calculated from their pas t. All of it defied logic once one added other generation-to-generation dynam ics such as remar- riages and divorces. 65 Logical or not, everywhere Germany was buzzing with the need to trace ancestry by cross-indexing births, deaths, ba ptisms, and other data going back generations. Since racial decrees mandat ed that only Aryans could participate in many walks of life, German ind ividuals, companies, schools, associations of every size and caliber, an d even churches, were gripped by the necessity to prove their Aryan purit y and to exclude everyone else. Moreover, physical characteristics such as he ight, stature, and blond, blue-eyed features, were all thought to be coeffici ents of racial descent. Linguistics played a dynamic role. Words such as pu blic health and medi- cine, nationality, foreigners, family and family ge nealogy, hereditary, and even the word German, took on special anti-Semitic impli cations. Jews were for- eigners, and in many cases thought to be disease ca rriers. Racial impurity was a public health issue. Only Aryans could be Germans . The word German became exclusionary. A competitive, confusing, and often overlapping net work of governmental, private, and pseudo-academic agencies with constand y evolving names, juris- dictions, and sponsors sprang up into existence. Ma ny of them direcdy or in- direcdy benefited from Hollerith's high-speed techn ology to sort through the voluminous handwritten or manually typed genealogic al records needed to construct definitive family trees. These machines w ere often housed elsewhere, such as the Reich Statistical Office departments, w hich processed pen and paper forms into race statistics. No one shall ever know how many race track- ing agencies accessed which machines in which locat ions during those first chaotic years. But this much is known—the Third Rei ch possessed only one method of cross-tabulating personal information: De homag's Hollerith system."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Germany's complex of race science agencies ultimate ly look on a bureau- cratic life of its own. The Fuhrer's Office operate d the Race Political Office. The Justice Ministry empowered one of its lower cou rt divisions to rule on mat- ters of hereditary health. Josef Goebbels' Ministry of Propaganda vested its Department II with questions of Jewish policy, popu lar health, and popula- tion. Labor and unemployment offices under the aegi s of the Labor Ministry maintained an index of foreigners, meaning Jews and non-Aryans. 66 Race science in the Interior Ministry was the prove nance of the Reich Committee for the Protection of German Blood. Depar tment I dealt with issues of race law and policies. Department IV stud ied population politics, genetic hygiene, and medical statistics. Department VI was concerned with foreign groups within Germany. 67 The Reich Health Office, also part of the Interior Ministry, included two special units: Department L supervised genetic heal th and racial hygiene; Department M was authorized to oversee genetic rese arch. In addition, the Reich Committee for Popular Health, which advised t he Interior Ministry, maintained a sub-office for genetic and race hygien e. 68 In the Reich Statistical Office, which was complete ly dependent upon IBM equipment and technical assistance, Department IV was responsible not only for traditional data such as census, household , and family data, but nation- ality and race statistics as well. The Ministry of Science and Education devel- oped special offices for racial and genetic researc h and oversaw the work of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human Ge netics and Eugenics. 69 The Nazi Party itself also maintained a plethora of structured and infor- mal special advisory bureaus on race and public hea lth. 70 Offices devoted to race science melded genuine docu mentation with rumors, poison pen letters, and vengeful tips. Chal lenges to one's Aryan background were commonplace. Whether driven by a se nse of national duty or ordinary fear, everyone was forced to confront t heir racial make-up. At the apex of racial grading was a bureaucratic entity at tached to the Interior Min- istry. This section began its existence before 1933 as the Nazi Information Office. Ultimately, after numerous name changes, it became known as the Reichssippenamt, or Reich Family Office, endowed wi th the final authority to decide who was Jewish or Aryan. 71 Lists were distributed, exchanged, and updated cont inously, often in a haphazard fashion. To cope with the growing bureauc ratic fascination with punch card records, senior Interior Ministry offici als reviewed one fanciful pro- posal for a twenty-five-floor circular tower of dat a to centralize all personal information. The proposal was rejected because it w ould take years to build"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"and stork. But the futuristic concept opened the ey es of Reich planners. Each of the twenty-five floors in the imagined tower wou ld be comprised of 12 circular rooms representing one birth year. Every c ircular room would con- tain 31 cabinets, one for each day of the month. Ea ch cabinet would in turn contain 7,000 names. Registrations and updates woul d feed in from census bureaus. All 60 million Germans could then be organ ized and cross-indexed in a single location regardless of changes in resid ence. Data could be retrieved by some 1,500 couriers running from room to room li ke so many magnetic impulses fetching files. 72 Lists were indeed everywhere. Non-German Registries were maintained in police stations, employment bureaus, professiona l associations, church organizations, local Nazi departments, and the SS S ecurity Office, the Sicher- heitsdienst, known as the SD. The SD was under the control of Reinhard Hey- drich, nicknamed the Hangman. Buried within the bowels of Heydrich's Berlin offic e was the Depart- ment of Research, which developed registries on Fre emasons. In 1934, one of the SD's nameless specialists on Freemasons demo nstrating particular zeal was a corporal who had just transferred in from the Dachau concentration camp. He showed such promise working with registrie s that he was re- assigned to Referat II 112, the Jewish Department, where he could work with more lists. The corporal's name was Adolf Eichmann. 73 As the cross-indexing capabilities and sorting rout ines of Dehomag's machinery became more sophisticated, race researche rs continuously discov- ered greater informational depth about Jews and tho se of Jewish bloodline. For Dehomag, such statistical feats were both its s cience and its competitive edge. Educating its customers was an everyday occur rence. An August 1934 article in the Dehomag publication, Hollerith Nach- richten, extolled the benefits of advanced data pro cessing. The article, enti- tled \"An Improved Analysis of Statistical Interdepe ndencies via Hollerith Punch Card Process,\" illustrated how difficult data calculations could be bet- ter interpreted and predict probabilities. As a pri me example, the journal cited \"the field of medicine, and the science of ge netics and race.\" Complex tabulations could be rendered, the article suggeste d, regarding \"the size of fathers and their children, number of children and parents. Diphtheria and age, and the different racial characteristics.\" The article explained, \"Even though the gathering of statistical material in ind ustrial and commercial busi- nesses has steadily grown in size . . . in administra tive archives and because of censuses and other surveys, the interpretation h as not kept pace. Due to the lack of manpower ... one is limited . . . to sort ing out past developments."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"... This is not always enough... The actual justifi cation for the collection of data in great quantity is the a b i l i t y to draw concl usions . . . and ensure a safe estimate of future and current occurrences.'\" 74 Racial purity was not just a catchphrase for Nazis, it was an obsession. Germany wanted more than a society of Aryans, it wa nted a master race: tall, strong, blond, and blue-eyed, intellectually and ph ysically dominant. Eugen- ics became an elite cult. Nazis sought to weed out the weaker elements of its population, regardless of parentage—even from among their own people. The mentally ill, diseased, handicapped, homosexual individuals, certain Jews, Gypsies, and a group of misfits termed \"anti- social,\" were not to be part of Germany's future. Beginning in summer 1934, the Third Reich took the next step. Armed with statistical data and other information collect ed from medical offices, doctors, and insurance companies across the nation, Germany began orga- nized sterilization. TWO DECREES were promulgated by mid-1934. One was The Law for S impli- fication of the Health System, enacted in July 1934 , requiring doctors and other clinicians to fill out detailed forms about the hea lth condition of their patients. These were filed with Health Offices and eventually processed by Hollerith systems at the Reich Statistical Offices in Berlin and its regional divisions. The information, combined with extensive informatio n from health insurance questionnaires, created a eugenic profile . 75 The second decree was The Law for the Prevention of Genetically Sick Offspring made active in January 1934. Eugenic theo rists in Germany had developed a maze of precepts mandating exactly whic h bloodlines should be terminated based on the statistical probability of endowing defective genes. Sterilization guidelines initially specified indivi duals deemed insane, retarded, epileptic or manic-depressive, among others. 76 But now eugenic pseudo-academicians and Nazi statis ticians evolved an additional belief that a man's right to live was determined by his net worth to Nazi society. \"The only value of man—and t his is a direct object of statistics—is his economic value . . . his human labo r productivity,\" wrote Friedrich Zahn in a 1934 edition of the German stat istical journal, Allge- meines Statistisches Archiv. Zahn's article, \"The E conomic Value of Man As an Object of Statistics,\" reminded that, \"statistics i s identical in character with the National Socialist idea.\" 77 Zahn called for a \"registration of the various risk s which threaten the value of productivity ... [as a result of] ... illn esses, disability, unemployment"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"and non-accomplishment of occupational goals.\" Popu lation engineering, he emphasized, would rely upon extensive data analysis , including s t a t i s t i c s from a gamut of health bureaus, disability and liab ility insurers, unemployment offices, and even academic testing data from school s. 78 Nazi genetic experts worried about not only those i ndividuals exhibit- ing undesired traits, but the parents and/or childr en who might carry those traits and therefore contaminate the gene pool. One census theoretician pos- tulated that the potential for contamination could be set at a 25 percent chance per diseased parent. Hence, once an undesira ble person was identi- fied, the parents and offspring, including newborn children, required steril- ization as well. 79 Quickly, the notion of sterilizing the physically u ndesirable expanded to include the socially undesirable. So-called anti -socials, that is, misfits who seemed to be unsuited for labor, became special tar gets. A leading raceolo- gist described anti-socials as \"those who, based on their personality, are not capable of meeting the minimum requirements of soci ety, i.e., personal, social, and volkisch behavior.\" One official defini tion cited: \"human beings with a hereditary and irreversible mental attitude, who . . . have repeatedly come into conflict with government agencies and the courts, and thus appear ... a threat to humanity.\" Included were traitors, race violators, sexual per- verts, and \"secret Jews.\" But, \"the numerically lar gest group consists of 'the work-shy and habitual parasites'\" 80 Compulsory sterilization was aimed principally at t hose adjudged phys- ically and mentally inferior regardless of their ra ce or nationality. However, the criteria applied not only to general groups exh ibiting the proscribed characteristics, but, in the new lexicon of anti-Se mitism, to virtually all Jews within Germany. Dehomag systems compiled nearly all the medical, he alth, and welfare statistics in Germany, either at the compilation si te or through the Reich Sta- tistical Office. Hollerith Nachrichten aggressively proliferated its population- engineering technology to new customers. An article entided \"The Hollerith Punch Card Process in Welfare and Social Security\" boasted, \"sorting proce- dures are done by Hollerith machines with such spee d and reliability that the directors of the welfare administration are unr estricted in their catalog of questions.\" It added, \"The solution is that every i nteresting feature of a statis- tical nature ... can be summarized . . . by one basic factor. This basic factor is the Hollerith punch card.\" 81 Questionnaires, although to be filled out by hand, were jointly designed by Dehomag engineers and Nazi disability or welfare experts for compatibil-"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"ity, since ultimately all information would be punc hed into Hollerith cards. Yet, as a Dehomag notice to users advised, the ques tionnaires would have to be adapted to the technical demands of the Hollerit h system, not the other way around. A vertical notice printed along the bot tom left of typical welfare forms often indicated the information was to be pro cessed \"by the punch card office\" generally an in-house bureau. 82 People seated in a doctor's office or a welfare lin e never comprehended the destiny of routine information about their pers onal traits and conditions. Question 11 required a handwritten checkmark if the individual was a for- eigner. Later, this information was punched into th e correlating punch card in columns 29-30 under nationality. 83 For many clerks and doctors, coding was a new proce dure. Various editions of Hollerith Nachrichten tutored readers o n the proper method of filling out Hollerith-compatible forms. In one issu e it reminded form proces- sots to code Special Characteristics in the several columns field 12. Anti- social was to be coded 1 in one column. In a second column, diseases such as blindness were coded 1. Mental disease was 2. Cripples were 3. Deaf people were 5. Parents who had already been sterili zed were to be noted with an \"s\"; children already sterilized \"because o f a parent's sickness\" were noted \"as\". 84 Uniform codes were established for occupations. Fac tory workers were coded 19, hotel and guesthouse workers were 23, the atre artisans were 26. Unemployed persons received the code number 28. The se codes were hand- written into field 8 on the forms. 85 Diseases were also coded: influenza was 3, lupus wa s 7, syphilis was 9, diabetes was 15; they were entered into field 9. 86 Once coded and punched, all data was then sorted by machine. If agencies lacked the manpower to undertake their registrations, or the money to buy the equipment, Dehomag would perform t he work for them. Insurers, for example, could send quarterly data di rectly to the Lichterfelde office for processing. Volume was important. \"Since the work is done by Dehomag,\" advertised a company solicitation, the ap proach was recom- mended for any insurance company carrying \"more tha n 15,000 members.\" 87 Graphs, organizational charts, and work flow diagra ms published by Dehomag bolstered the modern technological feat of its data processing. One work flow diagram showed the complex method by which handwritten forms and questionnaires in any agency's master per sonnel file were mar- shaled through a dozen separate sorting, proofing, resorting, and tabulating stages until results were finalized. 88 An individual looking at a plain paper"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"form filled out by pen or pencil might never compre hend the tortuous route that document would take through the Hollerith proc ess. One of the most aggressive locales implementing Hol lerith technology for race science was the city of Hamburg. Doctors t here submitted extensive forms on all their patients to a Central Health Pas sport Archive where the information could be retrieved when needed and exch anged with other reg- istries. Archive officials asked for reciprocal exc hanges with \"health and wel- fare institutions of all kinds, economic welfare, y outh and education welfare, court decisions, special foster care, sterilization s . . . and all other sentences where personality evaluations are considered.\" 89 Raceology was enabled as never before. Statistician Zahn extolled the fact that \"registered persons can be observed conti nually, [through] the cooperation of statistical central offices . . . [s o] other statistical population matters can be settled and regulated.\" Zahn propose d \"a single file for [the] entire population to make possible an ethnic biolog ical diagnosis [to] turn today's theory into tomorrow's practice. Such a fil e would serve both prac- tical considerations as well as science,\" he argued , adding, \"Clarified pictures of the volume of genetic diseases within the popula tion ... now gives science a new impetus to conduct research . . . which shoul d promote good instead of bad genetic stock.\" 90 Genetic denunciations and routine evaluations were adjudicated by the Genetic Health Courts based on a combination of ane cdotal evidence and Hollerith data. The accused included parents guilty of no more than the mis- fortune of a birth-defected child, innocent newborn s of the statistically sus- pect, helpless individuals condemned as depressed o r psychiatric within a world gone mad, and those who just didn't fit into the new Nazi milieu. 91 In the sterilization program's first year, 1934, mo re than 84,600 cases brought to the Genetic Health Courts resulted in 62 ,400 forced steriliza- tions. In 1935, 88,100 genetic trials yielded 71,70 0 forced sterilizations. 92 Eventually, sterilization was viewed as merely prel iminary to more dras- tic measures for cleansing the Reich. Zahn warned i n a statistical journal arti- cle: \"population politics, according to the princip les of racial hygiene, must promote valuable genetic stock, prevent the fertili ty of inferior life, and be aware of genetic degeneration. In other words, this means superior life selec- tion on the one hand, and the eradication of geneti cally unwanted stock on the other hand. The ethnic biological diagnosis is indispensable to carry out this task.\" 93 "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"W H E N H E R M A N HOLLERITH designed his first punch card, he made it the size of a dollar bill. 94 For IBM, information was money. The more Germany calculated, tabulated, sorted, and analyzed, the gr eater the demand for machines. Equally important, once a machine was lea sed, it required vast quantities of punch cards. In many cases, a single tabulation required thousands of cards. Each card was designed to be used only on ce, and in a single operation. When Dehomag devised more in-depth data processing, the improvements only bolstered card demand. How many punch cards were needed? Millions - per week. 95 Punch cards sped through the huffing machines of th e Third Reich like tiny high-speed mechanized breaths rapidly inhaled and e xhaled one time and one time only. But Hollerith systems were delicate, precision-engineering instruments that depended on a precision-engineered punch card manufac- tured to exacting specifications under ideal condit ions. Because electrical current in the machines sensed the rectangular hole s, even a microscopic imperfection would make the card inoperable and cou ld foul up the en- tire works. So IBM production specifications were rigorous. Con iferous chemical pulp was milled, treated, and cured to create paper stock containing no more than 5 percent ash, and devoid of ground wood, calk fibers, process- ing chemicals, slime carbon, or other impurities th at might conduct electric- ity and \"therefore cause incorrect machine sensing. \" Residues, even in trace amounts, would accumulate on gears and other mechan isms, eventually causing jams and system shutdowns. Electrical testi ng to isolate defective sheets was mandatory. Paper, when cut, had to lie f lat without curl or wrin- kle, and feature a hard, smooth finish on either si de that yielded a \"good snap or rattle.\" 96 Tolerances necessitated laboratory-like mill condit ions. Paper thickness: .0067 inches plus or minus only a microscopic .0005 inch. Width: 3.25 inches with a variance of plus .007 inches or minus .003 i nches. Two basic lengths were produced: 5.265 inches and 7.375 inches, plus or minus only .005 inch in either case. Edges were to be cut at true right angles, corners at perfect 60 degree angles, with a quarter-inch along the top and three-eighths along the side, all free from blade creases with the pape r grain running the length of the card. Relative humidity of 50 percent and a temperature of 70-75 de- grees Fahrenheit was required at all times, includi ng transport and storage. 97 Printing of the customer's name and specific projec t name was to be legible but not excessively inked and in no circums tances sufficient to dent"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"the card or nudge it out of its plane, which could microscopically alter thick- ness. Text or numbers had to be printed in precise positions to line up with punching devices and machine gauges. IBM instructio ns to mills declared, \"These specifications are absolutely necessary\" and any variation \"could dis- tort the result.\" 98 Only IBM could make and sell the unique punch cards for its machines. Indeed, punch cards were the precious currency of d ata processing. Depend- ing upon the market, IBM derived as much as a third of its profit from card sales. Overseas sales were even more of a profit ce nter. Punch card profits were enough to justify years of federal anti-trust litigation designed to break the company's virtual monopoly on their sale and ma nufacture.\" When Herman Hollerith invented his technology at th e close of the previous century, he understood the enduring commer cial tactic of prolifer- ating a single universal system of hardware and ens uring that he alone pro- duced the sole compatible soft goods. Hollerith was right to size his card like the dollar. IBM's punch card monopoly was nothing l ess than a license to print money. In the Third Reich's first years, Germany was compl etely dependent upon IBM NY for its punch cards. Even after the fac tory in Lichterfelde opened, German manufactured machines were useless w ithout cards im- ported from the United States. Card presses would e ventually be built in Germany, but until that time, Dehomag was constantl y scrambling to import the millions of cards ordered each week by its cust omers. To guard against sudden shortages, Lichterfelde needed a six-month s upply—enough to fill fifty-five railroad cars. Half the stock was stored off-site in leased ware- houses, and the rest in the factory. 100 So vital was the production of paper products that in May 1934 the Reich Ministry of Economic Affairs sought to regula te mills. An Economics Ministry decree placed an eighteen-month moratorium on establishing, clos- ing, or expanding paper mills without the specific permission of the Reich. Dehomag hoped to have its card presses in operation before the moratorium expired. 101 IBM was making so much profit in Germany, it was ca using problems. About $1 million profit was suddenly earned by the end of 1933, this at a time when nearly all of German industry was being b attered due to the inter- national anti-Nazi boycott. Dehomag had sold an unp recedented 237 percent of its 1933 quota—outpacing all IBM foreign operati ons combined. Yet Nazi business precepts denounced large corporate profits , especially those earned by foreign corporations. No wonder a nervous IBM au ditor in Europe con-"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"ceded to IBM NY, \"Dehomag is in an extremely danger ous position, not only with respect to taxation, but it may be cited as a sort of monopolistic profi- teer and, where primarily owned by foreigners, it m ay be seriously damaged by unfriendly publicity.\" 102 For Heidinger, IBM profits were good news. His pers onal bonus, expressed as a stock dividend, would total nearly a half million Reichsmarks. He wanted his share. But Watson was not so inclined . Reich currency regula- tions sequestered profits into frozen bank accounts disbursable only within Germany. Heidinger could be paid, but not Watson. M oreover, newly en- acted decrees taxed profit dividends harshly. If Wa tson couldn't receive his money, he saw no reason why anyone else should eith er. As the chief stock- holder, Watson voted that no dividends would be pai d. 103 Heidinger would not abide Watson first usurping Deh omag and now usurping his share of the profits. Dehomag's extrao rdinary growth was an accomplishment Heidinger had personally sculpted by virtue of his Nazi con- nections. He wanted the financial reward he felt he deserved. The war for control of IBM's money in Germany only escalated. Conflict arose in 1933 as soon as IBM announced the merger of its existing German subsidiaries, the million-dollar ex pansion, and new factory construction. Since Heidinger owned a token share o f one of the old minor companies being folded into the new larger Dehomag, he expected his stock to be purchased as part of the consolidation. Watso n refused, even though the buyout amounted to only RM 2,000, or about $500 . 104 On September 25, 1933, IBM's European Manager, W alter Jones, placed the question squarely with Watson personally . Heidinger, reported Jones, \"now thinks IBM should take this [RM 2,000] off his hands and asked that the matter be submitted to you.\" A New York au ditor acknowledged on Watson's behalf that IBM did in fact need Heidinger 's shares to effect the merger. But the auditor added, since \"the stock at the moment is worthless ... [because it has] lost its entire capital throug h its operations ... we do not think it would be fair for IBM to pay him anything for it.\" 105 Heidinger knew his stock had become worthless only by virtue of the losses engineered by Watson to avoid taxes. Heidinger fought back. He went direcdy to the Reich tax authorities, briefed them on IBM's entire complex merger plans, and asked for a formal ruling on the company's tax avoidance strategy. If Heidinger couldn't get his $500, it would be cosdy for the parent company. Qui ckly, IBM learned it was very expensive to fight the feisty Heidinger. 106 Tax officials proposed an assessment as high as a h alf million dollars. "},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Protracted negotiations ensued w i t h the t a x boards. Screams of letters and cables crisscrossed the Atlantic. Numbers, from the ferocious to the moder- ate, bandied between IBM offices. Heidinger had pos itioned himself to \"save the day\" by negotiating the taxes down to a quarter of their proposed assess- ment. New York began to comprehend the process. IBM auditor Connolly at one point understated the predicament: \"I should no t be surprised if he [Heidinger] set up scares [with government official s] and talked them off for the sound of it.\" 107 Financial battling between Berlin and New York seem ed endless. Hei- dinger continuously tried to extract bits of compen sation and sometimes trivial sums of expense money. IBM would block him through its controllers, managers, and attorneys. Heidinger would then retal iate by aggressively \"consulting\" Reich bureaucrats, which invariably le d to added costs. Con- nolly openly asked in one letter if Dehomag could j ust pursue its corporate business without Heidinger \"running to the German g overnment every time for approval.\" 108 One conflict came to a head at the June 10, 1934, D ehomag board meeting. Heidinger wanted IBM NY to pay his dividen d taxes resulting from the merger. He also resented the highly detailed fi nancial reports required each month by IBM auditors. Watson refused to pay H eidinger's dividend taxes and his auditors would not relent on their mi cromanaging oversight. At the board meeting, Heidinger angrily threatened tha t if his view did not pre- vail, than Dehomag was no longer an independent Ger man company, but a foreign-dominated firm. As such, he would notify au thorities in Berlin. Deho- mag would then be assessed an extra quarter-million in special taxes and \"prohibited from using . . . the word Deutsche\" in its name, since that term was reserved for Aryan businesses. Without the word Deutsche in Dehomag, he warned, government and commercial contracts woul d be lost. Minutes of the June 10 exchange were omitted from the meeting' s written record. Details, however, were summarized in a separate let ter to New York. 109 Ironically, when it came time to making capital inv estments, Heidinger took a completely opposite approach. In a memo aski ng IBM NY to under- take an expensive expansion of facilities, Heidinge r asserted, \"The manage- ment can merely submit proposals; the decision as t o whether something should be done about it, is the responsibility of t he owners.\" 110 Ultimately, IBM and Heidinger forged one batde-scar red compromise after another, howsoever transient. But no matter h ow insolent or disruptive Heidinger became, Watson refused to disengage from Dehomag's lucrative partnership with Nazi Germany. In fact, Watson was determined to deploy as"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"many lawyers, accountants, and managers as necessar y — and personally visit Berlin as often as required—to make sure IBM rec eived all the profit— frozen or not. The fight with Dehomag would continu e—not to reign in its technologic alliance with the Third Reich, but rath er to ensure that the profits continued and remained unshared. WATSON KNEW he needed to stay close to developments in Germany. In 1934, he visited twice. The first was a brief stay in late June to oversee the final merger of four IBM subsidiaries into the new larger Dehomag, a transaction long delayed by negotiations with the t ax authorities. In addi- tion, a new management and stock participation cont ract was needed for Heidinger. Watson wanted to be on hand if any last- minute disputes arose with Heidinger. 111 When Watson visited Berlin that June, the Reich's f orced sterilization program was just ramping up. Everywhere, Jewish mis ery was evident. Nazi Brown Shirts noisily blocked the doorways of Jewish -owned shops. Unem- ployed Jews were moving out of their homes. Signs d eclaring Jews \"not wanted\" were prominently posted outside stores and cafes. But Watson did not focus on the Nazi war against the Jews and othe r non-Aryans. He was concerned with IBM's market victories in Germany an d his war against any potential competition. IBM's only possible rival wa s Powers. Dehomag didn't own the entire German market for pun ch cards—only 95 percent of it. Since the first days of Herman Ho llerith's census contracts at the start of the twentieth century, IBM and its pre decessor companies had been dog-fighting the Powers Accounting Machine Com pany in the United States and indeed anywhere in the world Powers trie d to do business. James Powers was a Russian immigrant to America who had helped the U.S. Census Bureau break free of Hollerith's monopo ly in 1905 by develop- ing a similar card sorter. As such, Powers and the Hollerith companies con- stantly jousted and litigated on patent rights. In 1914, while Watson's criminial conviction for anti-trust was in appeal, a financially battered Powers, anxious to avoid further confrontations, simply ask ed Watson's CTR to license its punch card technology. Without that lic ense, Powers declared it would go out of business. Under the specter of fede ral charges, Watson ostentatiously agreed to license his competitor, Po wers, but at an exorbitant 25 percent royalty. This would ensure that Powers w ould survive as a minis- cule player in the punch card field, thus obviating federal charges of total monopoly. But the 25 percent royalty also meant tha t Powers' machines were"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"more expensive for customers and therefore profound ly less competitive. Besides, IBM would receive a good share of a l l of P owers' r e ve n u e s . 1 1 2 After the government dropped its anti-trust case ag ainst Watson, he was less inclined to let Powers survive. Recalling a ta ctic from his NCR days, Wat- son litigated against Powers extensively for variou s forms of patent infringe- ment, raided its key managers in America and abroad , and systematically pressured clients to switch to Hollerith systems. 113 In Germany, Powers did enjoy some minor installatio ns dating back to the 1920s primarily because it sold rather than lea sed its machines and had developed some highly specialized models. What's mo re, some machines, even though old, were simply still functioning. Som e was too many for Wat- son. Dehomag continued the IBM legacy of litigation by suing Powers in Germany. But this time, it was not for patent infri ngement. It was for not being sufficiendy Aryan. In the highly charged Nazi business environment, wh ere certain words possessed special meaning, Powers was one of many f irms that rushed to declare themselves \"under German management.\" But i n reality, charged Heidinger in the court complaint, two Americans wer e managing the Powers firm. Even after the Powers board of directors oust ed its two American man- agers, Heidinger claimed that the foreigners were n onetheless secredy con- trolling the company. All this, he argued, was desi gned by Powers \"to facilitate marketing for its products\" within the T hird Reich, thereby compet- ing unfairly with Dehomag through false advertising . Dehomag, on the other hand, was pure German and free from foreign influen ce, the complaint attested. 114 In late April 1934, the court agreed and permanendy enjoined Powers from representing that it was \"German.\" Punishment for infractions, the court ruled, would be an unlimited fine or imprisonment u p to six months for each infraction. 115 Watson had specifically authorized the Powers suit and been kept up to date on its developments. What's more, Watson wante d to identify Powers' clients and convert them to IBM equipment. Dehomag salesmen kept de- tailed intelligence on all Powers customers. Upon r equest of the New York office, Lichterfelde was able to produce a list of every Powers customer, in perfect columnar fashion, listing the year the clie nt purchased Powers equip- ment, which units were rented or purchased, the mac hine's application, and which Dehomag sales office was nearby. That list wa s regurgitated alphabeti- cally, chronologically, and geographically. 116 The uses for a finely tuned Hollerith surveillance system were unlim-"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"ited. Germany never lost sight of i t s most import ant objective: the war against the Jewish people and other undesirables. In that war, Germany would undertake a steep, years-long technologic cli mb as IBM systems improved, Nazi registration campaigns multiplied, a nd the net tightened. The Third Reich was just beginning to apply Dehomag sol utions. By the end of 1934, medical, welfare, and insurance offices were joined in their punch card registrations by nursing homes and sanitariums as well as an ever-increasing number of German healthcare prac titioners. A Registry of anti-social persons was launched. Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, inaugu- rated the SS Statistical Yearbook. And \"continuing education\" courses in racial hygiene conducted by noted statisticians became wid ely advertised. 117 In addition, preparations were finalizing for a na tional Work Book. Employers were to fill out a booklet for each emplo yee and then submit it to the appropriate Labor Office. Eventually, 354 such Labor Offices would be opened across Germany. While the Work Book was over tly a means of identi- fying and regimenting every worker in the Third Rei ch, a data field near the top right asked whether, under the current Nazified definitions, the worker was a \"foreigner or stateless.\" Work Books, tabulat ed by punch card, would become the basis for ever-increasing population scr utiny. Jews, of course, were not permitted to work. When they were discover ed, they were termi- nated. He who did not work would starve. Eventually , without a Work Book, Jews could not obtain ration cards to purchase food . 118 Ultimately, card by card, sort by sort, those of an y Jewish blood would be weeded out from every corner of German society n o matter how they tried to hide. In 1934, statistician Karl Keller expostulated the popular expectation that gealogical tracing technology would eventually discover all the Jews. Writing in Allgemeines Statistisches Archiv, Keller assured, \"The determination of Jewish descent will not be difficult because mem bership in the Jewish faith and membership in the Jewish culture were nea rly identical before the emancipation of the Jews. It is therefore sufficien t to check the change of de- nominations in church registers and registry office s for the last 130 years.\" 119 Statistical sweeps with the help of Hollerith techn ology were already canvassing baptism records, birth and death registr ies, and other church records, not only to certify Aryanism, but also to isolate Judaism. Dehomag's customers included such bodies as the Catholic Buri al Society in Munich and the Church Council in Eisenach. Some church gro ups processed infor- mation on their own equipment, some merely reported their data to other monitoring agencies.

The company created two surrealistic promotional po sters. One was a giant punch card hovering over a factory beaming its X-ra y-like searchlights into every room of every floor. The caption read: \"Holle rith illuminates your com- pany, provides surveillance and helps organize.\" A second poster depicted a giant odious eye floating in the sky projecting a p unch card over everything below. The caption read: \"See everything with Holle rith punch cards.\" 121 No one would escape. This was something new for man kind. Never before had so many people been identified so precis ely, so silently, so quickly, and with such far-reaching consequences.

So despite the military marching and ostentatious weaponry, this day, September 15, 1935 , would be dominated not by border threats, but by Nazism's anti-Semitic frenzy. Since 1933, the Reich had legislated Jewish disloca tion from virtually every facet of German professional, commercial, and social life. Many Jews were so thoroughly excluded by Aryan mandates, they were reduced to buying and selling mainly to each other just to survive. P auperization of German Jewry was a real threat and malnutrition of Jewish childr en was already attracting the attention of international aid agencies. Yet many J ews still clung to their rela- tive anonymity. In businesses owned or controlled b y Jews, or where their participation was essential, Jews felt they could c ontinue unidentified, un- noticed, unmolested. 4 If they could just stand in, they would not stand out. Nazi theorists continued to bicker over what amount of Judaic parentage constituted an excludable Jew, and how far to trace bloodline. Determining Aryan pedigree was complicated by endless demograph ic and geographic vari- ables that simply slipped through the punch cards. Cagey replies to question- naires from individuals or companies nervous about their answers, as well as changing residential and business addresses, underm ined the process. More- over, suspect citizens rushed to baptismal fonts an d church pews to assume new or more pronounced Christian personas. In conse quence, tens of thou- sands of racial purity examinations had been conven ed since 1933. 5 Laxity and ambiguity helped. About a third of Germa ny's nearly 450,000 remaining registered Jews dwelled in Germany's smal ler cities and towns"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"where in many instances they continued to exist unm olested. Many local and national government agencies often found it easier to continue trading with reliable Jewish firms than locate an untested alter native. Hausfraus managing a tight budget commonly sneaked away to Jewish reta ilers seeking discounts after their dogmatic husbands went off to work. 6 Doctrinaire Nazis fought back. Night classes for ho usewives instructed women how and why to avoid Jewish shops. A court ru led that husbands were not legally bound to pay for purchases their w ives made at Jewish stores. The mayor of Baden was fired when his deali ngs with Jews were dis- covered. Jew-baiters such as Julius Streicher publi shed rabid, pornographic newspaper accounts of ritual murder and rampant sex ual perversion by Jews, and then cajoled and humiliated all loyal Germans i nto boycotting Jewish enterprises. Brown Shirts blocked the doors of Jewi sh establishments and graffittied their exteriors. But too many Germans s imply would not or could not comply with the complex confusing strictures to not buy from Jews. Most importantly, too many simply did not know where all the Jews were. 7 In the absence of an explicit law defining exactly who in Germany was a Jew, Nazi persecution was far from hermetic. For ye ars, such a definition would have been a cloudy exercise. Even if Nazis co uld agree on such an exegesis, no one could back up the definition with hard data. Since the advent of the Third Reich, thousands of Jews nervou sly assumed they could hide from the Aryan clause. But Jews could not hide from millions of punch car ds thudding through Hollerith machines, comparing names across generations, address changes across regions, family trees and personal d ata across unending reg- istries. It did not matter that the required forms or questionnaires were filled in by leaking pens and barely sharpened pencils, on ly that they were later tabulated and sorted by IBM's precision technology. Even as Hitler's fanatic followers thunder-marched through Nurem- berg, Hollerith machines in Berlin were dispassiona tely clicking and rattling through stacks of punch cards slapping into hoppers to identify the enemy for the next drastic measures. Throughout 1935, race specialists, bolstered by pop ulation computa- tions and endless tabular printouts, proffered thei r favorite definitions of Jewishness. Some theorems were so sweeping as to in clude even the faintest Jewish ancestry. But most tried to create pseudo-sc ientific castes limited in scope. These latter efforts would encompass not onl y full Jews who pro- fessed the religion or possessed four Jewish grandp arents, but also the so- called three-quarter, half, and one-quarter Jews of lesser Jewish lineage. 8 "},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Adolf Hitler was personally aware of preliminary Ho llerith findings that while only about a half million Germans registered as Jews in the census, the veins of many more coursed with traces of Jewish bl ood. About a million more. 9 He wanted something done about the continuing Jewi sh presence. The Jews Hitler feared most were the ones not appar ent. Der Fuhrer had been working on the long-awaited racial definition for some weeks, but the enforceable formulae and calculations were still in conclusive. 10 On September 10, 1935, he flew from Berlin to Nurem berg to open the Party Day celebrations. Church bells sounded an d flowers were thrown adoringly as his automobile wended through the stre ets paced by newsreel cars. But belying the flourish was a Hitler impatie nt to intensify Jewish obliteration. 11 Suddenly, on September 13, 1935, Hitler demanded th at a decree be hammered out—now—within forty-eight hours, in time for his appearance before the Reichstag as the culmination of Party Da y festivities. Top racial experts of the Interior Ministry flew in for the as signment. Working with drafts shuttled between Hitler's abode and police h eadquarters, twin decrees of disenfranchisement were finally patched together . The Law for the Protec- tion of German Blood and a companion decree entitle d the Reich Citizenship Law deprived Jews of their German citizenship and n ow used the term explicitly—Jew, not non-Aryan. Moreover, Jews were proscribed from marry- ing or having sexual relations with any Aryan. Jewi sh employers could not even hire an Aryan woman under the age of 45—a conc ession to Streicher's hysteria regarding sexual perversion. The laws woul d apply not only to full Jews, but also to half and quarter Jews as well, al l according to complex racial mathematics. 12 Despite the decree language, the precise arithmetic of Jewish ancestry had still not been finalized. How could one differe ntiate a quarter Jew from a so-called Mischling, or person of some mixed Aryan and Jewish blood? Indeed, it would be months of drafting and redrafti ng before those fractions were finally settled. 13 Laborious and protracted paper searches of individu al genealogical records were possible. But each case could take mon ths of intensive research. That wasn't fast enough for the Nazis. Hitler wante d the Jews identified en masse. Once drafted, the Nuremberg regulations woul d be completely dependent upon Hollerith technology for the fast, w holesale tracing of Jew- ish family trees that the Reich demanded. Hollerith systems offered the Reich the speed and scope that only an automated sy stem could to identify not only half and quarter Jews, but even eighth and sixteenth Jews. 14 "},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"With the denouement of September 15 approaching, Ge rmany's own sense of Jewish numbers was changing dynamically. A s Security Police Chief Heydrich had concluded, \"it has become apparent tha t a great number of Jews in Germany have become baptized in the Evangel ical and Catholic faiths with the idea that once they changed their r esidence, they would no longer appear as Jews in the registries.\" 15 Earlier in 1935, the Party's Race Political Office had estimated the total number of \"race Jews.\" Thanks to Dehomag's people-c ounting methods, the Nazis believed that the 1933 census, which recorded a half million observant Jews, was now obsolete. Moreover, Nazis were convin ced that the often- quoted total of some 600,000 Jews, which was closer to Germany's 1925 census, was a mere irrelevance. In mid-June 1935, D r. Leonardo Conti, a key Interior Ministry raceologist, declared 600,000 rep resented just the \"practic- ing Jews.\" The true number of racial Jews in the Re ich, he insisted, exceeded 1 . 5 mi l l i o n . Conti, who would soon become the Minis try's State Secretary for Health overseeing most race questions, was a key as sistant to the officials rishing to compose the Nuremberg Jewish laws for Hi tler. 16 Working in bureaucratic anterooms and elegant villa s, the race scientists tore up version after version until their paper sup ply ran out. So they finished writing on menus. Finally, at 2:30 A . M . on September 15, armed with the most up-to-date statistical information, the decree s were cobbled into pre- sentable form. 17 The scene was set for Hitler's announcement that e vening. At 9 P.M., September 15, a grandiose if improvised hall decorated with streamers and ceiling fabrics was convened as a Rei chstag for 600 deputies. They gathered for the sole purpose of ratifying the laws their Fuhrer would declare. Hitler outwardly appeared as his usual cha rismatic self, carefully stirred in riding pants tucked into polished jack-b oots, a red swastika arm- band round his left elbow, and a tie neatly buried under a fully buttoned soldier's jacket. His hair, austerely slicked to on e side, bannered above his unmistakable narrow mustache to create Nazism's emb lematic face. But to at least some observing him, der Fuhrer seemed tired f rom the long debate over Jewish definition. From his seat on the stage, he a scended three steps to a podium overlooking a massive assembly of the devote d stretching dozens of rows back and more dozens left and right of a great center aisle that was empty except for the obligatory photographer and a newsreel cameraman. Behind, a full orchestra and organist sat stilled, their instruments set down. Facing him, thousands waited, rapt with anticipatio n. 18 Hitler's speech, revised at the last minute, lasted only twelve minutes. Even though passionate, and at times fiery, his voi ce sounded weak. He ram-"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"bled from point to point. Throughout, der Fuhrer to re into a world commu- nity that was offending German honor and boycotting German goods. As usual, he blamed the Reich's one great enemy. \"We m ust notice here,\" he accused, \"mostly Jewish elements are at work.\" He r ipped into \"international Jewish agitation\" and declared, \"The time had come to confront Jewish interests with German national interest.\" 19 Referring to the population statistics rendered by his raceologists but rounding off the numbers, der Fuhrer cried out, \"a nation of 65 million per- sons has a right to demand that she is not respecte d less than the arbitrari- ness of 2 million persons.\" For the first time, Hit ler had left behind the well-worn totals of 400,000 to 600,000 German Jews and now pronounced the updated Hollerith tabulated numbers. 20 New racial laws, he promised, would immediately str ip German Jews of their citizenship, even more severely restrict thei r activities and outlaw their ability to hoist a German flag. More than once, Hit ler remonstrated, \"the law is only an attempt at legal regulation. However, sh ould this not work . . . should Jewish agitation within and without Germany continue, we will then examine the situation again.\" 21 Gesturing fanatically, he concluded with this warni ng: The new law \"is an attempt at the legal regulation of a problem, wh ich, if it fails, must be turned over to the Nazi Party for final solution.\" 22 The pleasant Nuremberg night and reverberating Sieg Heils suddenly turned to rain. Hitler's well-photographed smile wa s now nowhere to be seen, not even as the crowd cheered him all the way from the Reichstag hall to his hotel. 23 Everywhere, the new formulaic approach to Jewish pe rsecution exploded into worrisome headlines. Under a page one banner story, the New York Times lead was typical: \"National Socialist Ge rmany definitely flung down the gaundet before the feet of Western liberal opinion tonight . . . [and] decreed a series of laws that put Jews beyond the legal and social pale of the German nation.\" The paper went on to detail the legal import of the ancestral fractions. 24 The news was everywhere and inescapable. The League of Nations' High Commissioner for Refuge es Coming from Germany issued all member governments a long, detai led, and scathing report of the Reich's determination to persecute Je ws on an unprecedented basis, all based on tabulating the percentages of t heir ancestry. The report's opening page sounded a special alarm: \"Even more om inous was the decla- ration of the German Chancellor: '. . . should, how ever, the attempt at legal"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"regulation fail, then the problem must be turned ov er to the National Socialist Party for final solution.''\" 25 Ironically, while all understood the evil anti-Jewi sh process underway, virtually none comprehended the technology that was making it possible, The mechanics were less than a mystery, they were t ransparent. In 1935, while the world shook at a rearmed Germany speeding toward a war of European conquest and total Jewish destruc tion, one man saw not revulsion, but opportunity—not horror and devastati on, but profit and divi- dends. Thomas Watson and IBM indeed accelerated the ir breakneck alliance with Nazism. Now Thomas Watson, through and because of IBM, would become the commercial syndic of Germany, committed as never before to global advocacy for the Third Reich, helping his utmost to counteract Hitler's enemies and further der Fuhrer's military, political, economic, and anti-Semitic goals. Even as he continued as a state sman of American capital- ism and a bulwark of international commerce, Watson would become a hero in Nazi Germany—both to the common man and to Adolf Hitler himself. NAZI GERMANY was IBM's second most important customer after the U.S. Business was good. Hitler needed Holleriths. Rigid dictatorial control over all aspects of commerce and social life mandat ed endless reporting and oversight. What's more, Germany's commercial isolat ion and preparation for was compelled the National Socialist regime into a frenzied campaign of autarky that necessitated upward spirals of surveil lance and bureaucratic med- dling into the smallest industrial details. Nazi pl anners wanted every object in daily life—from trucks to paper clips—coded, invent oried, and regimented. But no matter how preoccupied with economic and arm ament drives, the Reich inculcated every program with its maniacal de sire to eradicate the Jew- ish presence. IBM was guided by one precept: know your customer, anticipate their needs. Watson stayed close to his customer with fre quent visits to Germany and continuous daily micro-managed oversight of the business. Everywhere one turned in America or Germany in 1935 , it was clear that identification and exclusion of the Jews was o nly the beginning. The next step was confiscation and Aryanization. During the two previous years, most Aryanizations were disorganized. Jews were for ced from their business or profession and then pressured to sell their ente rprises to Aryans for a frac-"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"tion of the value. Thousands of others fled the cou ntry as refugees with their portable possessions worriedly stuffed i n t o bulging suitcases. Homes, vehicles, and chattels were left behind, often to be seized i n satisfaction of trumped-up juridical penalties or simply taken over as abandon ed property. 26 Jewish presence in smaller towns now became the mos t precarious. Once identified, Jews were unable to earn a living, then unable to even pur- chase food or medical supplies. Local shopkeepers, kept in line by neighbor- hood anti-Jewish boycott vigilantes, prominently di splayed signs forbidding Jews to shop within. Pointed threats and a late nig ht visit from hooligans usually sealed the family's departure decision. Dur ing 1935, dozens of locali- ties were able to post signs on their outskirts dec laring that they were Jew- free and/or Jews were no longer permitted to purcha se lands or even enter the town limits. As Jews were methodically driven t o lodge with friends and family in larger cities, they left behind their rea l estate and often much of their goods. Now the body of unattended Jewish prop erty was growing. 27 When a town became Jew-free, it became a publicized event. In Ger- many, the town administration or local Nazi groups would eagerly advertise the accomplishment. Foreign newspaper and radio bro adcasts chronicling Nazi oppression frequently reported the development as well. Typical was an article in the New York Times, May 28, 1935, headli ned \"All Jews Quit Hers- bruck.\" The article reported, \"A swastika flag has been hoisted over a house in Hersbruck, near Nuremberg, which has been the ho me of the last remain- ing Jewish resident in the district.\" 28 But Watson didn't need to read about Aryanization i n newspapers. He discovered it personally. In July 1935, Watson visi ted Berlin. That July, Nazi thugs ran wild in the streets of Berlin smashing th e windows of fashionable Jewish stores. One of those department stores was o wned by the Wertheims, family friends of the Watsons. The Watson family le arned that to protect the store, Mr. Wertheim first transferred the property to his Aryan wife, but then ultimately decided to sell \"for next to nothing\" an d escape to Sweden. On another visit to Berlin, the Watsons and other IBM executives were invited to an elegant reception at the Japanese embassy. While sipping tea in the gar- den, a German diplomat boasted that the exquisite h ome formerly belonged to a Jew who fled the country. Such new ownership o f greatly discounted homes was now common in Berlin. 29 By late 1935, however, the Nazis envisioned a more systematic and state-controlled process to expropriating Jewish pr operty. Just after the en- actment of the Nuremberg Laws, the Nazis began floa ting plans for a clear- inghouse to gobble up all Jewish holdings for a pit tance. This plan was no"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"secret. I was widely promoted in Germany through th e Party's Economic Information Agency. And the news traveled abroad. A New York Times article on September 24, 1935, was headlined \"Nazis Plan to Buy Out All Jewish Firms; Stress Bargains Resulting from the Boycott.\" The article reported, \"The plan calls for the purchase of Jewish firms by a central corporation, and their distribution among ambitious Aryan businessme n. It is suggested that such businesses can be obtained cheaply.. . . The N azi organ responsible for this ' solution of the Jewish problem' makes startl ing guesses as to what the prices would be. It says, 'some fairly large Jewish firms can be purchased for 40,000 marks' Evidendy . . . the Jews can be induce d to feel a very pressing desire to sell.\" The newspaper noted that under suc h conditions, Jews might then be faced either with the prospect of \"emigrati on or semi-starvation.\" 30 As part of the drive to liquidate Jewish assets, Na zis began visiting Jew- ish homes and invalidating their passports. Now Jew s could not even become refugees without paying a confiscatory flight tax o f 25 percent of their hold- ings in Germany. 31 Identifying Jewish possessions was the next step. Banks, financial institutions, and pension funds we re among Dehomag's most important clients. Indeed, Dehomag maintained an entire department for the banking industry. IBM designed highly speci alized tabulating equip- ment for banks, including the BK and BKZ models, wh ich were capable of producing customer statements and recording specifi c transactions. On Au- gust 12, 1935, savings banks were suddenly required to provide the Reichs- bank with detailed information about all their depo sitors. Some banks used the Hollerith process by coding accounts into one o f ten professional cate- gories Dehomag had established. Hollerith Nachricht en published a notice for those institutions that did not yet own sorting mac hines, advertising that Dehomag could do the sorting in-house for a fee. Th e company bragged that it possessed the ability to cross-reference account numbers on bank deposits with census data, including grouping by profession or industry. 32 Dehomag's financial documentation capabilities soar ed when it unveiled a powerful new model dubbed the D-11, which could p rocess numerous account developments, compute interest, and help cr eate detailed customer records. Within months, the new D-11 would allow hi gh-speed data manage- ment of bank accounts at dazzling levels. 33 At the same time, the human identification process proliferated. Local and regional statistical offices registered new bir ths on Hollerith cards, care- fully noting the religion of both parents. Marriage s were also registered on punch cards, again noting the religion of both part ners. These cards were then forwarded to regional Dehomag service bureaus, such as the one in"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Saarbrucken at Adolf Hitlerstrasse 80. More than ha lf the local regional sta- tistical offices operated card punchers, but could not purchase their own sorters because of the backlog and expense of the m achines. So Dehomag conducted the sorts on its own premises, just as it did for so many tabula- tions. Once Dehomag completed its work, the data wa s sent on to the Reich Statistical Office where it was combined with a con fluence of other data streams. 34 Personal information about Jewish people in Germany was always changing—precisely because of the innumerable dislo cations Jews suffered. For this reason, starting in 1935, the authorities required Jewish communal leaders to report their members by age and gender n o longer annually, but quarterly. 35 Such data was just one more trickle comprising the river of cross- indexed information Hitlerites processed to isolate the Jewish nemesis. Eventually, the Hitler regime felt statistically re ady to espouse regula- tions defining just what constituted a Jewish busin ess. A firm was labeled \"Jewish\" if the owner or a partn er was Jewish, if even a single Jew were in management or on the boar d of directors. If a quarter of its shares or votes were held by Jews, o r under Jewish influence through nominees or agents, the company was classed Jewish; this regulation made it increasingly difficult and dangerous to mas k ownership. A company could be owned and operated by undisputed Aryans, b ut if it maintained a branch managed by a Jew, that branch would be decla red Jewish. 36 Naturally, it would be impossible to certify a comp any as being Jewish unless denouncers knew the identities of all busine ss principals and were profoundly certain which of those individuals quali fied as Jewish under the Nuremberg Laws. But fewer Jews could hide from the dragnet IBM had helped the Reich construct. This forced companies t o quickly identify and terminate, even if reluctandy, any of its Jewish ma nagement, and even its own Jewish ownership. Once a company was deemed to be Jewish, as defined under the special regulations, its inventory and assets would ultimat ely be registered. Hollerith systems that could inventory people could inventory merchandise as well. Among Dehomag's most important customers were the T rade Statistics Office in Hamburg, the Reichspost, and various national an d local taxing offices. Decrees of the Reich Economics Ministry's Kommissar for Price Control, be- ginning in 1936, required uniform reporting procedu res by key industries. In most cases, the installation of IBM machinery was m andatory in order to comply. Government statisticians and Dehomag had de veloped coding sys- tems for virtually all raw materials and finished g oods. Eventually, the coding"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"system would make it possible for the Nazis to orga nize its seizures with stunning specificity. 37 None of Germany's statistical programs came easy. A ll of them required on-going technical innovation. Every project requir ed specific customized applications with Dehomag engineers carefully devis ing a column and corre- sponding hole to carry the intended information. Du mmy cards were first carefully mocked-up in pen and pencil to make sure all categories and their placement were acceptable to both Dehomag and the r eporting agency. No information could be input unless it conformed to D ehomag specifications. Therefore, the Reich tailored its data collection t o match Hollerith require- ments. Moreover, there was only one source to purch ase the cards: Dehomag. The company sold them, generally in lots of 10,000, often preprinted with project names. Of course, once Dehomag approved the formats, it trained the reporting agency's personnel to execute the work. 38 Dehomag was Germany's data maestro. During the frenetic rush to expand business with th e Nazis and auto- mate more and more Reich projects, never once was a word of restraint uttered by Watson about Dehomag's indispensable act ivities in support of Jewish persecution. No brakes. No cautions. Indeed, to protest Germany's crusade against Jewish existence would be nothing l ess than criticizing the company's number two customer. Despite the innumera ble opportunities to disengage or decline to escalate involvement in the war against the Jews, IBM never backed away. In fact, the opposite occurr ed. Watson became intensely proud of the German subsidi ary's accom- plishments. In late November 1935, two months after the Nuremberg Laws were espoused, and just days after more headlines w ere made when the Reich issued highly detailed genealogical dicta def ining just who was Jewish under the decree, Watson traveled to Berlin to cele brate Dehomag's twenty- fifth anniversary. A lavish company banquet was sch eduled for November 27 at the exclusive Hotel Adlon. More than 150 invitat ions were distributed. IBM offices in New York, Switzerland, Italy, France , and Norway were repre- sented by their top executives. Dignitaries such as U.S. Ambassador to Ger- many, William E. Dodd, Hitler's press attache, Erns t Hanfstaengl, former German consul in New York, Otto Kiep, and Reich Eco nomics Minister, Hjal- mar Schacht were invited. Important industrial cont acts were on the list. Even if some, such as Schacht, could not attend, mo st did. 39 Sumptuous food was served in the Watson tradition o f elaborate dinner events. The Heidingers, Rottkes, and Watsons toaste d their success. But even as the precious crystal glinted and ornate silverwa re gleamed, the utilitarian"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"machine rooms of Lichterfelde and countless other d ata processing offices throughout Germany continued their own demographic clatter. The machines never slept. Not everyone could be as jubilant and splendid as t he Watson revelers at the Hotel Adlon. Unseen and unheard were Jews, c owering in t h e i r homes, fearing visibility. Goebbels had already war ned them. \"We have spared the Jews,\" asserted Goebbels, \"but if they i magine they can just stroll along the [fashionable] Kurfurstendamm as if nothin g at all had happened let them take my words as a last warning.\" In anoth er warning, Goebbels demanded, \"Jews must learn to break with their past behavior and leave public places in Germany to the Germans.\" These wer e not quiet comments murmured at obscure party meetings but public threa ts reprinted worldwide, including in the New York Times under headlines suc h as \"Nazi Warns Jews to Stay at Home.\" 40 Now Watson eagerly launched a program to expand Deh omag's capabil- ity. Ten more boxes of machinery had been shipped f rom New York to Ham- burg in November 1935 on the SS Hansa. Millions of additional punch cards would be rushed across the ocean until Dehomag coul d produce them in Germany. Branch offices were opened throughout the Reich, the Lichterfelde factory was enlarged, and a second factory was esta blished to manufacture spare parts. 41 While in Berlin that November 1935, Watson attempte d to gain techni- cal information from Dr. Fels, a key Reich Statisti cal Office expert who had helped organize the 1933 census. Watson learned tha t despite Fels' expertise, he had been ousted from his position because he was Jewish. Dehomag delivered a note to Watson's hotel explaining that Fels was now living as an unemployed refugee with his family in New York, \"in quite a bit of misery.\" The note added that IBM in America had declined to give him a job. But Watson wanted Fels' expertise. So immediately upon his return to America Watson arranged a meeting. On February 3, 1936, Fel s briefed Watson in his Manhattan office and they spoke of such wide-rangin g issues as the German census and the prospects for similar projects elsew here. As for employment, Watson did assure he would ask around and see if an y of the many organiza- tions he was associated with might offer Fels a job . 42 After the Fels briefing, joint exchanges on both si des of the Atlantic between IBM NY and Dehomag sales and technical staf f became constant. These exchanges were highly selective, well thought out, and very costly investments in future work. Dozens of Dehomag sales men, engineers, and managers came to America for training and exchange of expertise. IBM es-"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"tablished a special sales training s c h o o l in Endico tt, New York, predomi- mantly attended by German and other European IBMers . Sales training was necessary because despite all the proliferation in punch card systems, repre- sentatives encountered continual resistance from go vernment officials on just how the elaborate new technology worked. At Endicot t, salesmen learned how to fire the imagination of bureaucrats and conv ince them that IBM's technology could provide solutions for any governme ntal requirement—no matter how unprecedented. 43 Four of IBM NY's brightest engineers and managers, all of Germanic descent, were eventually transferred from America t o the Berlin operation: Walter Scharr in 1936, and Otto Haug, Erich Perschk c, and Oskar Hoermann in the following years. One Austrian inventor, Gu stav Tauschek, was so prized, he demanded—and was granted—an annual contr act guaranteeing him six months with IBM in the United States and si x months in his beloved Austria. Tauschek generated dozens of valuable pate nts. Indeed, anticipating Dehomag's expansion, IBM NY filed for patents in va rious European coun- tries to protect the inventions of its German subsi diary. 44 New devices never stopped appearing. Numbered gang punches type 501 multiple punching. Electrical interpreters type 550 for analysis. Elec- trical accounting machine type 400 for zone punchin g. Summary punch type 516 for cumulative information. Dehomag developed i ts own motor-driven duplicating printing punch type 016 for high-speed processing, and calculating punches type 621 and type 623. Multiplying punches were able to tally the sum of two punched holes on a single card, shorteni ng sort time. High-speed reproducers, alphabetic tabulators, numeric and alp habetic interpreters, hori- zontal sorters—a parade of metal magicians joined t he repertoire. 45 Many of these devices were of course dual-purpose. They as routinely helped build Germany's general commercial, social, and military infrastructure as they helped a heightening tower of Nazi statistical offe nsives. In Germany, some of the devices, such as the IBM Fi ngerprint Selecting Sorter, were only usable by Nazi security forces. 46 Specialized printing presses for punch cards were f inally installed in 1935, allowing Dehomag to print its own punch cards . In a typical eight-hour shift, allowing for pauses to change plates and re- ink, each press could pro- duce 65,000 cards. Within two years, IBM would inst all fifty-nine such presses in Germany—fifty-two from the only European press source that could manufacture them, and seven from the United S tates, including several high-speed units five times faster than the Europea n models. 47 In 1936, Dehomag opened its first full-time school for customer train-"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"ing. Courses for beginning card punchers typically required two weeks of intensive study. Additional courses were needed to master the more delicate skills of operating the sorters and tabulators. Eac h new device required addi- tional training. A Development Laboratory, staffed by ten engineers, was opened. Initial projects included high-speed punche s and automatic paper feeders for the new D-11. Ironically, despite all i ts increased factory space, technical support from America, and extra investmen t, demand was so high that Dehomag was still two years behind in filling its mounting list of orders. 48 It was a never-ending batde to supply systems. And the Reich needed them so urgendy. IBM WAS MAKING a fortune. Since the day Hitler came to power, the com- pany had been reaping millions from its German oper ation. How many mil- lions might never be known because the company buri ed its profits in bizarre inter-company transactions. But the outward manifestations of IBM's growth and prosperity and the \"admitted profits\" it reported were amazing to a nation struggling to recover from the Depressi on. \"December 1933 was the largest December in the comp any's history,\" Watson boasted to stockholders during one early 193 4 meeting. He added that January 1934 was also the largest January in t he company's history and February 1934 saw conceded profits of $103,000 abov e the year before. Wat- son predicted the trend would continue throughout 1 934. These profits were declared despite every attempt to weave revenu es into complicated, untaxable inter-company shunts. Net income for 1933 —to the extent it was identified given blocked accounts in Germany—was re ported as $5.73 mil- lion, including income from foreign subsidiaries. M ost telling, of $55.4 mil- lion in assets, $16.2 million was surplus cash. 49 Net income for the first six months of 1934 was $3. 4 million over the $2.9 million posted in 1933, even after adjusting f or various inter-company charges. Income increased to $5 million for the fir st nine months of the year, or $7.18 per share over $6.22 per share the previou s year. A dividend of 2 percent was declared in addition to the regular qua rterly dividend. 50 Equally impressive to the business press were the n umbers for 1935. Watson began the year by predicting IBM's continued upsurge. \"Our trade abroad is improving,\" reassured Watson, \"as shown b y the fact that for the first ten months of 1934 our exports increased abou t 35 percent over the corresponding period of 1933. One of the main facto rs contributing to industrial recovery may be found in the constandy i ncreasing cooperation"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"among political, industrial and financial leaders.\" Million-dollar profits con- tinued to rise in 1935. Shares for the year bloate d to $9.38. 51 However the funds were classed or categorized, Deho mag alone paid some $4.5 m i l l i o n in dividends to I B M during the ea rly Hitler years. 52 IBM announced it would erect a building at 32nd Str eet and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Then the company purchased $1, 000 life insurance policies for all 6,900 of its employees on the job since January 1933 or ear- lier. While dedicating a new addition to the compan y's plant in Endicott just before Christmas 1934, Watson extravagantly announc ed a Yule gift—a 37 percent minimum wage increase for 7,000 workers. Sh ortly thereafter, news- papers revealed that Watson had become the highest paid executive in Amer- ica. They dubbed him the \"thousand dollar per day m an.\" Watson received a bonus of 5 percent of all IBM profits worldwide. S o his total salary amounted to $364,432 per year, or nearly as much as the combined salaries of the chairmen of Chrysler and General Motors. Wit h characteristic aplomb, Watson defended his unprecedented compensation. Then IBM bought another Manhattan building site, this one at 57th a nd Madison. 53 In mid-1935, Congress had passed a new law with an extraordinary impact on IBM: the Social Security Act. Congress ha d invented a bureau- cracy no one was sure could even be implemented. So cial Security would require a central file on nearly 30 million America ns. 54 Until this point Hollerith systems had still not attained the techno logic ability to create a sin- gle central registry. That is why so many repetitiv e sorts by statistical agen- cies were undertaken and updated so frequently. When the Social Security law was passed, no budget appropriation and no infrastructure were in place because bureaucrats were convinced that \"the machinery ... to do the job . . . did not exis t.\" Nor did the first Social Security officials believe that nearly 30 million A mericans could be quickly punched into a first-time-ever system, and then sor ted, assigned a number, and eventually alphabetized. Nor did anyone imagine that such voluminous records could be searchable and retrievable based o n name and number. 55 Hollerith machines, as they were understood to exis t in America at the time, could do no more than add, subtract, tabulate , and tally punch cards. But Social Security required collation, \"the abilit y to take two sets of records and do a [simultaneous] matching to see whether . . . they were related to one another,\" as government technicians described i t. 56 To the amazement of the bureaucrats, IBM was ready. The company was quickly able to unveil a so-called \"collator\" t hat could achieve precisely what the government had in mind: compare and cross- reference two sets of"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"records in a single operation. Therefore, it was no t necessary for the govern- ment to invent its own equipment. IBM would provide the solution. 57 Washington awarded I B M an on-going contract so subs tantial it per- manently boosted IBM into a corporate class of its own. Watson's people boasted that Social Security was \"the biggest accou nting operation of all- time.\" Actually, it was the second biggest. The dre ss rehearsal had already taken place in Germany in 1933. It will never be kn own whether the collator was invented in Germany or the United States, or as a collaborative effort of IBM's cross-Atlantic development programs. But shor tly after it appeared in the United States, the collator also appeared in De homag's inventory. Deho- mag was so impressed with the talented machine, the subsidiary deployed dozens of them, and planned to produce or import 50 ,000 more. 58 From the moment Washington anointed IBM with the So cial Security contract, the company's income catapulted six-fold within several years. Social Security and a diverse parade of lucrative c ontracts from the Depart- ment of Labor to the War Department created a verit able federal partnership with IBM. 59 The company became quasi-governmental. Large-scale research and development into punch card registration, ident ification, and storage and retrieval systems were now funded by the U.S. g overnment as well as Nazi Germany. IBM's technology jumped. As a result of massive American taxpayer-funded research, more people-managing punc h card capabilities than ever before would be available to the Hitler r egime. WATSON ' S STRUGGLE to retain profit in Nazi Germany was all consuming. Reich regulations were constantly tightening the ru les for business in cash- starved Germany. Austerity measures required ever-i ncreasing domination of industry. Moreover, Heidinger never paused in his b atde to reap his portion of the Dehomag money. Watson could handle Reich reg ulations. But Hei- dinger was something else. Barely a day passed without numerous position paper s, contract drafts, legal opinions, and explanatory memos wafting betwe en IBM offices in Geneva, Paris, Berlin, and New York trying to maint ain an edge in Watson's profit war with Heidinger. Every time one fire seem ed doused, new flames erupted. For example, IBM was faced with a Dehomag profit of RM 1.2 million at the end of 1934. Watson didn't want to pay the taxe s in either Germany or the United States. To both take the profit, yet make it disappear, European auditors in late February 1935 concluded that \"the new Dehom ag will simply have to"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"show a deficit as of December 31, 1934, after payme nt of the RM 1.2 million 1934 dividends. The deficit will be made up within the first few months of 1935.\" That dividend of course would be classed a \" royalty,\" making it ap- pear as an expense. However, at about the same tim e, even the royalty loop- hole dried up. IBM accountants reported to IBM that \"royalty payment to New York is no longer possible.\" Confronted with a technical deficit for the first quarter of 1935 and unable to transfer profit , Dehomag petitioned the Berlin authorities for temporary tax relief, claimi ng \"a hardship.\" 60 The problem was that Heidinger earnestly wanted a p rofit shown so he could qualify for a bonus. Without a formal prof it showing, Heidinger's 10 percent bonus would never materialize. Before th e merger, Heidinger was accustomed to receiving a monthly bonus of RM 1 0,000. Under the new arrangement, IBM reaped huge earnings as royalties or other \"fees,\" but his income suddenly disappeared. Until the profits could again be declared, Heidinger demanded a monthly \"loan\" of RM 5,000 jus t to make living expenses. 61 Only Watson could authorize it. He did agree, but k ept Heidinger on a short leash. The loans would extend only until Augu st 1935, at which time \"the whole position will be reviewed again.\" 62 Upon learning of his temporary morsel, Heidinger, o n March 3, 1935, shot off a saccharine thank you to IBM NY Vice Pres ident Otto Braitmayer. \"It was indeed a great pleasure for me to receive . . . your kind letter of Feb- ruary 21 by which you allow me to receive from the Dehomag during the first eight months of this year a monthly advance o f RM 5,000—instead of dividends which will be declared later on. . . . th ank you very much for your kind thinking of me on occasion of my 60th birthday . . . which brings me nearly into your class of age.\" 63 But then an additional Reich regulation hit, this o ne completely under- cutting windfall profits. New rules prohibited dist ributed profits in the form of dividends above 8 percent of a company's origina l investment. Since Dehomag's soaring profits were now vasdy in excess of IBM's original capi- t a l i z a t i o n , the dividend cap applied. As it became increasingly difficult for IBM NY to extract monies from Germany, profits stil l remained undeclared. It seeme d that no matter what was done, Dehomag's g rowing business made money but profit was never declared. 64 An IBM comptroller's analysis conceded that by fidd ling with losses, \"It is obvious that Mr. Heidinger would draw about 40 p ercent of the total divi- dends which could be declared.\" At the same time, t he analysis added, IBM would only be able to receive 60 percent of what it was expecting. 65 "},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Finally, Heidinger caught on that I B M los ses were j ust as valuable as profits. If he couldn't get a bonus on profit—he de manded it on the losses. Ironically, IBM managers were unable to deny the lo gic. \"Mr. Heidinger is justified to a certain extent,\" conceded one intern al memorandum, \"in asking that the losses in the other divisions be taken int o consideration . . . because ... the surplus is reduced.\" 66 IBM agreed to give Heidinger a bonus on losses, but struggled to phrase the arrangement since German taxing authorit ies would never believe genuine losses could create a bonus. Finally, to as suage Heidinger, the com- pany agreed to declare a phantom dividend first, pa y Heidinger a 10 percent bonus on that amount, and then recast those same nu mbers as losses to avoid tax. 67 But what should be done with the blocked funds? In July 1935, during a Dehomag board meeting Watson attended in Berlin, he directed that \"the money should rather remain invested in the firm and be credited to the license account [royalties], as direct remittances are not possible.\" Heidinger was offered extra incentives, such as insurance and a generous pension. 68 The feisty German agreed, but that only postponed t he next round of finan- cial fisticuffs. Meanwhile, to realize blocked profits, Watson chann eled money into tangible assets. He expanded Dehomag's Lichterfelde factory, retrofitted an old underutilized pre-merger facility in Sindelfing en outside Stuttgart, and installed additional card printing presses. The rac e was on to build those presses and expand factories, because shortly, the Reich would decree that German companies could no longer pay for any i mports from America. The new rules prohibited such imports, by either ca sh or credit. Hence intra- company accounts could no longer be manipulated to create losses. Dehomag could no longer mask as a legitimate expense its ow n machinery shipped from one IBM company address to another. The German subsidiary would have to become completely self-sufficient. 69 Rottke bragged to the Dehomag board chairman in New York that he had beat the new regulations because \"I have still imported as much mer- chandise as ever possible\" from IBM NY before the n ew regulations took effect. 70 Stockpiling IBM supplies, machines, spare parts, f abricating equip- ment, and punch cards meant that Dehomag received a decisive manufactur- ing impetus without the need to remit any money to New York. That only strengthened Dehomag's balance sheet, and made it a more powerful compo- nent of IBM. But now surplus cash escalated in Germany beyond ev en Dehomag's"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"needs. Watson needed to invest in German assets th at would retain their value. They could be sold later. Eventually, I B M co mmissioned its outside auditors—Price Waterhouse—to join IBM managers in m aking investment recommendations. An extensive written report was su bmitted. Stocks of other German companies were considered too volatile . Timberlands were debated, but deemed unlikely to be approved by the Reich as a precious nat- ural resource. Buying an independent paper factory was rejected since paper was now highly regulated by the Reich. 71 \"Rental property might be acquired, preferably in B erlin,\" an IBM European manager suggested to Watson in a letter. T he decision was Wat- son's. He chose apartment buildings. These could be turned over to local rental agents for leasing, thereby generating incom e as well. 72 Berlin was filled with some very discounted real estate at the time. IBM began buying apartment buildings. The propertie s purchased were not prime locations, but reliable sources of r ental income. One building was at Schutzenstrasse 15/17. A second was at Markg rafenstrasse 25. Attor- ney Konrad Matzdorf, whose office was near one of t he addresses, managed the sites, and according to one IBM assessment, \"ac cumulated a substantial amount of money for the rentals.\" 73 As IBM plowed its Reichsmarks into hard assets, it already anticipated a wider European presence. In 1935, Watson shifted th e company's European headquarters from Paris to a city with a better ban king environment, Geneva, Switzerland. A Price Waterhouse report later confir med that while dividends and profits destined for the United States were ind eed blocked in Germany, \"the regulations quoted above do not apply to trans fers to Denmark, Bel- gium, Holland, Switzerland and Italy, since these c ountries have made spe- cial arrangements with Germany in connection with t he transfer of interest and dividend payments.\" 74 As it happened, IBM maintained operations in Denmark, Belgium, Holland, Italy, and now Switzerla nd. Although the arrangement to pay Heidinger bonuses o n losses origi- nated in 1935, the small print of any agreement wit h the Dehomag founder consumed months of wrangling. During that time, IBM was astonished to learn that Heidinger had never quite filed all the many merger papers from 1934, thus preserving some or all of his original c orporate compensation rights. More than that, the language in some of the merger documents Hei- dinger drew up was so convoluted, no IBM translator could understand it. At the end of 1935, an IBM manager confessed to New Yo rk, \"the translation is still very confusing and actually it is hard to tel l exactly what it means. Also you will be interested to know that both Mr. Rottke and Mr. Zimmerman of"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"the German company are unable to determine the exac t meaning of the Ger- man original.\" 75 Pure and simple, Heidinger would not finalize the m erger papers until his bonus was rectified. The matter had been draggi ng on since late 1933. IBM was operating companies that arguably did not q uite legally exist for lack of the proper paperwork. Once and for all, IBM wanted to straighten out its contractual messes with Heidinger. Both sides, in spring 1936, agreed to new bonus language. Heidinger visited New York in early 1936 to attend the Hundred Percent Club, the international IBM celebration of those ex ecutives meeting or exceeding their annual sales quota. Dehomag was alw ays the number one foreign revenue producer. While Heidinger was in Ne w York, there was plenty of face-to-face time for him and Watson to w ork out the smallest details of the final agreement governing the merger and bonus. A special letter was crafted by a Berlin attorney confirming that the contract was just a private undertaking between two stockholders with Dehomag, not with Watson in his capacity as chairman of IBM. This con tinued the fiction that Dehomag was not under foreign influence. 76 So little trust remained that each side secured its own attorney. IBM Vice President Braitmayer sent a letter to a Europe an manager in Geneva, and in a postscript asserted, \"You will understand that I wish to avoid any unnec- essary legal expenses, yet it is essential that IBM interests be fully protected and that you avoid any such complications as were i nvolved in the 1934 con- tract drawn by Mr. Heidinger.\" Braitmayer added, \"I am depending upon you to use some tact and judgment in handling this situ ation. And I hope you will understand that this letter is [only] for the perus al of yourself.\" 77 Finally, on June 10, 1936, with numerous translatio ns, multiple trans- lated copies, attorneys in abundance, and signature s inked everywhere, an extensive array of eight document sets was executed , thus finalizing the Dehomag merger of 1933 and securing Heidinger's bon uses. To further bol- ster the image of German ownership, IBM ultimately arranged so-called \"loans\" for directors Hermann Rottke and Karl Humme l so they could pur- chase nominal shares of Dehomag. The loans were col lateralized by the shares themselves and neither individual enjoyed \"t he right to sell or transfer to any third parties\" any of their shares. No money changed hands. In conse- quence, it appeared to Reich authorities that three Germans owned Deho- mag, even if in fact it was controlled 100 percent by IBM NY. 78 As Watson reviewed a passel of final signed, notari zed, sealed, and reg-"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"istered documents, America's most powerful bu sinessman undoubtedly hoped that the war for profits in Germany was over. Heidinger might now be pacified. Watson was wrong. GERMAN JEWRY did not understand how, but the Reich seemed to be ail- knowing as it identified and encircled them, and th en systematically wrung the dignity from their lives. Indeed, it was clear to the world that somehow the Reich always knew the names even if no one quit e understood how it knew the names. Confiscation and Aryanization escalated throughout 1936, as did physi- cal brutality. On September 8, 1936, a New York Tim es report headlined \"Reich Seizing 25% of Fortune of Jews\" reported: 'T he order served on Jews by local tax authorities demands that they dep osit within eight days 'security' equal to the Reich escape tax . . . one- fourth their total assets. Jews on whom the order was served were frank in stating that sudden withdrawal of 25 percent of their capital meant ruin to their business and nothing was left except to shut down.\" 79 On September 17, 1936, a New York Times report hea dlined \"Nazi Penalties Heavier\" reported: \"The Sturmer, Juliu s Streicher's anti-Semitic weekly, announces that the Reich Justice Ministry h as instructed public pros- ecutors to demand more severe punishment for Jewish race defilers—Jews convicted of having had relations with German women . The Sturmer, which regularly prints a list of Jews sentenced during th e week throughout Ger- many, has long complained that German courts are to o lenient.'\" 80 The day before, the New York Times was one of many publications that printed Streicher's explicit remarks to newspa permen. The article, sub- headlined \"The Way to Solve Problem Is to Extermina te Them,\" reported: \"The Nuremberg high-priest of anti-Semitism . . . a nnounced that in the last analysis, extermination is the only real solution t o the Jewish problem. Mr. Streicher made it clear in his address that he was not discussing the question in regard to Germany alone . . . but of a world pro blem. He declared there were some who believed the Jewish question could be solved 'without blood,' but. . . they were seriously mistaken. ... if a final solution was to be reached 'one must go to the bloody path.' Such meas ures would be justified, Mr. Streicher declared, 'because the Jews always at tained their ends through wholesale murder and have been responsible for wars and massacres. To se- cure the safety of the whole world, they must be ex terminated,' he said.\" 81 "},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"The world could not help but know the dismal result of Nazism. What they did not read, they saw. Refugees were everywhe re. Trains screeched into Paris, Prague, Warsaw, Brusse ls, Geneva, and Madrid. Ships lowered their gangplanks at Boston, N ew York, Mexico City, London, and Johannesburg. On every arrival, refugee s were an unmistakable sight. Emerging as a family group, wearing their fi nest, towing suitcases and footlockers filled with clothes and memories, t hey stepped with hard- summoned pride and irrepressible confusion into the dim of displacement. Many were professors toting books bundled with cord . Some were doctors and lawyers lugging well-worn briefcases. A number were merchants stowing precious leather ledger books. Not all of them were Jewish. Some didn't even believe they were Jewish. Many were intellectu als or dissidents of vari- ous religions. Children were told stories about sud den vacations. Parents wondered what the night would bring. Not all had pa pers. Some carried smuggled gold and jewels to re-establish themselves . But most had little to defray their existence. The machinery of confiscati on had sent them out vir- tually penniless or with their dwindled assets trap ped in a hostile Reich. An amalgam of disorganized rescue and relief was un derway. The League of Nations, Jewish organizations, Zionist bo dies, church groups, gov- ernmental committees, labor unions, and ad-hoc muni cipal agencies strug- gled to find housing, jobs, and moment-to-moment su ccor for the refugees. But all of the several dozen helping drew upon mone y and resources that fundamentally did not exist at a time when all nati ons were suffering from the weight of their own domestic depression. The wo rld's brittle ability to as- sist was cracking. By late 1935, more than 125,000 had escaped Germany. In Holland, more than 5,000 had arrived. Czechoslovaki a also extended asylum to more than 5,000. Poland absorbed 30,000. France had received 30,000 refugees but transferred 20,000 to other countries. Nearly 37,000 had es- caped to the United States, Palestine, and Latin Am erica. 82 So global was the crisis that the League of Nations appointed James G. McDonald a special High Commissioner for German Ref ugees. McDonald's compelling report on the mounting catastrophe, issu ed as he resigned in frustration, declared, \"Perhaps at no time in histo ry have conditions been less favorable to the setdement of such a difficult inte rnational problem.\" The gates were closing. Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann d eclared the world was divided between places where Jews could not stay, a nd places where Jews could not go. 83 It was against a backdrop of human misery everywher e that Watson proved that he was a special friend of the Nazi Rei ch. More than just his"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"investments in Germany, and his strategic socializi ng with German diplomats and industrialists, Germany felt Watson was an ally in the Nazi battle for eco- nomic recovery and conquest. Watson never spoke a w ord of c r i t i c i s m against his customer Nazi Germany. But more than that, he w orked to breach the gorge of isolation surrounding the Reich. One of hi s main venues was the International Chamber of Commerce and its U.S. affi liate, the United States Chamber of Commerce. The American Chamber of Commerce, comprised of the nation's most powerful magnates and corporate executives, was a p owerful political in- fluence in America. Its Foreign Department function ed as the American Section of the International Chamber of Commerce. T he ICC was a non- governmental organization created by the League of Nations to promote world trade and study the hard mechanics of treatie s governing such interna- tional commerce as postal, shipping, currency, bank ing, and patent rules. Watson was elected chairman of the Foreign Departme nt, which also made him the chairman of the American Section of th e ICC. This, in essence, made Watson America's official businessman to the w orld. 84 In his new capacity, Watson seized the opportunity to rapidly organize the Eighth Biennial Congress of the International C hamber of Commerce to be held in Paris in June 1935. Quickly, he secured the U.S. Government's imprimatur for the event, thus elevating its status and glitter. To that end, numerous letters were exchanged with Secretary of S tate Cordell Hull and his subordinates. State Department officers were in vited to sail on the same ship with Watson and his ICC co-delegates as a cohe sive entourage. Ameri- can ambassadors, consuls, and attaches from across Europe were beckoned t o a t t e n d . Hull himself was importuned by Watson fo r a message of con- gratulations for the ICC's related Council meeting and referring to \"world peace.\" Such a greeting from Hull, prominendy print ed in program notes and shown to key contacts, would reinforce the image of Watson as a political dynamo within the Roosevelt Administration. 85 After a flurry of minute revisions, Hull strung tog ether a sequence of inconsequential words that Watson could publish to show the American gov- ernment's seeming approval of the Paris event and, more importandy, of Wat- son's leadership of it. \"I take this means,\" cabled Hull, \"of expressing my interest in the purpose of the meeting which you wi ll attend to discuss ways i n w h i c h business organizations can cooperate most effectively to secure a more adequate and practical economic approach to wo rld peace. The meet- ing is timely and I shall be glad to learn its resu lts on your return.\" 86 In the bright glare of the international media, Wat son assembled the"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"world's leading corporate leader including those fr om the Third Reich, to discuss the most pressing economic problems of the day. The topics debated: avoidance of competitive currency depreciation; uni form treatment of for- eign corporations; payment of international debts; and international protec- tion of inventions, trademarks, patents, and models . 87 Grandiloquent speeches before the plenary, debates among working groups, e laborate communiques to government leaders, and hastily organized press dispatches spodighted the official agenda of the Congress. 88 But one pressing economic topic was never raised du ring the eminent conclaves. The issue was not an abstruse fiscal mac hination that dwelled in the unnoticed realms of international economic theo ry. It was the one finan- cial crisis that threatened to overwhelm civilized governments throughout the Western world by the sheer crush of its tragic sorrow and economic implication. Refugees were never mentioned. Indeed, the whole issue of the Hitler menace was si destepped as Wat- son encouraged all to assume a \"business as usual\" posture with Germany. Hitler's Reich craved respite from the torrent of i nternational criticism bat- tering its economy. Watson did what he could to hel p. Germany believed that if it could just export its products and be left al one to pursue its militancy, the Third Reich would prevail. In the Nazi mindset, whenever it could func- tion routinely in world commerce, it won fleeting v alidation for its course. During the Paris Congress, Watson was elected the n ext president of the entire ICC. He was now the undisputed paragon o f world trade. He would be installed as president at the next ICC Con gress scheduled for June 1937. As such, he was proud to announce his persona l selection for the host site. The world may have been isolating Germany. Al l Western nations were suffering the financial burden of Nazi oppression. Refugees flowed to their cities. Tension arising from Hitler's threats of in vasion and exported Fascism spurred an expensive arms race. But Watson staunchl y urged all to join him in what he promised would be the biggest and most g randiose Congress yet. \"We are going ... to Berlin,\" he told his Chamber c olleagues. \"We are free from those particular antagonisms which strong political feelings have caused so much to break nations apart.\" 89 Watson would not criticize Hitler. On the contrary, in his coundess interviews and public speeches, Watson somehow seem ed to emphasize ideas the Reich found profoundly supportive. At any other time in history, Wat- son's words might have been received as visionary g ems. But in the tenor of the times, they struck a chord of grateful resonanc e with the Reich. Speaking at both IBM and ICC events, Watson regular ly pleaded for"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"\"an equitablc r e d i s t r i b u t i o n of n a t u r a l resources,\" and expressed his support for a rearmed Germany. He voiced his oft-qu oted opinions at a time when the Reich was daily violating the Versailles T reaty by rebuilding its war machine, and threatening to invade neighboring regi ons to acquire the very natural resources it felt it deserved. 90 Watson was explicit at one key conference when he a sked ICG col- leagues to press their contacts in government for \" some sound understand- ing in regard to limitation of armaments,\" and then admitted, \"we are not talking about disarmaments.\" As usual, he added tha t progress was needed on one other point, \"which is of the greatest of im portance, a fairer distribu- tion of raw materials.\" Addressing the crippling bo ycott facing Germany, Wat- son repeated his mantra, \"\"We believe that as soon as we can have the proper flow of trade both ways across the border, there wi ll not be any need for sol- diers crossing those boundaries.\" 91 Even when spoken to his face, Watson maintained aph asic disregard for any criticism of the Hitler regime. At an April 26, 1937, ICC banquet in Washington preparatory to the Berlin Congress, the guest speaker was John Foster Dulles, former American legal counsel to the Treaty at Versailles and one of the nation's foremost international law expe rts. His presentation was entitled \"The Fundamental Causes of War.\" Watson wa s not happy about the topic. Before Dulles spoke, Watson even lobbied Dul les to change the title. Dulles openly quipped that Watson had complained: \" Nobody wants to hear about war, let's hear about peace.\" To this, Dulles told the members, \"I said, 'Alright, you [Watson] can write the title if I can write the speech. Before I get through, I think you may wish that. . . I had written the title and he had writ- ten th speech.\" 92 Dulles tore into Germany, saying all the things Wat son had considered impermissible. 'Take the case of Germany,\" said Dul les, with Watson standing next to him. \"Inability to get foreign exchange [du e to the anti-Nazi boycott] has blockaded Germany almost as effectively as she was blockaded during the war by fleets and the armies of the Allies. The re is a shortage of food, a shortage of raw material, and the same sense of bei ng circled by hostile forces. ... It may be that in fact a country has al l the facilities, which it requires to develop within its borders . . . It may b e possible to prove all that as a matter of logic. But logic has never cured a m ental disease.\" 93 Caustically declaring that the well-worn catchphras e of \"peace\" ban- died by Germany and its intellectual allies was a f raud, Dulles forcefully insisted. \"A state to remain peaceful, must afford its individual citizens an opportunity to work and to enjoy the fruits of thei r labor. There must be no"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"undue repression of the individual . . . where such repression occurs on a large scale peace is threatened. The outbreak, when it comes, may be civil war, but it may equally be international war.\" 94 When Dulles finished his long speech, Watson declin ed to even acknowledge it had taken place. Departing from his usual toastmaster effu- siveness, Watson simply introduced the next speaker , the American Secretary of Agriculture. Minutes later, Watson tried to coun teract Dulles' comments by exhorting his fellow entrepreneurs to support the I CC gathering in Germany. \"At our meeting in Berlin,\" urged Watson, \"we hope to see as many of you people as possibly can get over because it is of gr eat importance to your country that you be there and assist us in carrying on that meeting.\" 95 Watson reviled any detraction of Germany. One typic al comment to the Associated Press, reported in the New York Times, u sed some of the same formulations Hitler defenders themselves had so fre quendy invoked. \"Mr. Watson scoffed at the possibility of another world war,\" said the Times. \"'World peace,' he [Watson] declared, 'will result when the nations of the world concentrate on their own problems and set the ir individual houses in order.'\" 96 When challenged, Watson would insist, \"I'm an optim ist.\" Those among friends and family who knew him best later tried to excuse his behavior as \"naive.\" 97 But there was none shrewder than Watson. He calcul ated his words like a carpenter: measure twice, cut once. Watson confessed his feelings shortly thereafter in a draft letter to none other than Reich Economics Minister Schacht. \"I hav e felt a deep personal concern over Germany's fate,\" Watson wrote, \"and a growing attachment to the many Germans with whom I gained contact at home and abroad. Thi9 attitude has caused me to give public utterance to my impressions and con- victions in favor of Germany at a time when public opinion in my country and elsewhere was predominantly unfavorable.\" 98 Moreover, Watson knew war was imminent. So did Heid inger. In Octo- ber 1936, long before the intellectual showdown wit h Dulles, Heidinger sent a memo to IBM NY detailing plans to build bomb shel ters for Dehomag in case war broke out. \"The authorities have approache d us,\" reported Hei- dinger, \"with demands that sufficient care should b e taken to protect our plant and operations against air attack. In view of the fact that we are located close to a railway station, such demands seem justi fied ... in the interest of the safety of the lives of the workers and employee s ... we believe we should recommend immediately the setting up of air raid sh elters. . . . Something must surely be done immediately.\" 99 "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"With metric specificity, Dehomag's memo called for two massive bomb shelters, each large enough for 950 people or a mas s of machinery, as well as an underground tunnel linking factory buildings at the Lichterfelde complex. The bomb shelters were later approved by Watson. 100 Thus IBM assured that Hitler's punch card capability would be protected f rom Allied strikes, even if those included American bombers. T h o m a s Watson was more than just a businessman sell ing boxes to the Third Reich. For his Promethean gift of punch card technology that enabled the Reich to achieve undreamed of efficiencies both in its rearmament p r o g r a m and its war against the Jews, for his refus al to join the chorus of strident anti-Nazi boycotters and isolators and ins tead open a commercial corridor the Reich could still navigate, for his wi llingness to bring the world's commercial summit to Berlin, for his value as a Roosevelt crony, for his glitter and legend, Hitler would bestow upon Th omas Watson a medal— the highest it could confer on any non-German. The Merit Cross of the German Eagle with Star was c reated for Thomas Watson to \"honor foreign nationals who made themsel ves deserving of the German Reich.\" It ranked second in prestige only to Hitler's German Grand Watson was honored. At the next ICC Congress, he wo uld not only be installed as president of the ICC, he would be deco rated by der Fuhrer. Work- ing with Goebbels as stage manager, Watson would ma ke the 1937 ICC con- ference in Berlin a commercial homage to Germany. H itler in turn would make that event a national homage to Thomas Watson. THE G REAT 24,000-ton oceanliner Manhattan brought ninety-five American executives and their families to Hamburg on June 24 , 1937, where they re- freshed and boarded trains for Berlin to attend the ICC gathering. As usual, Watson made arrangements for the State Department, its ambassadors, con- suls and other envoys to sail with the group or oth erwise become abun- dantly visible. In Berlin, the Americans would join more than 2,500 delegates and others from forty-two other countries marshaled by Watson to make a strong showing. The group included 900 from Germany . The suites of the Hotel Adlon, Bristol, and Continental were waiting. The Adlon doubled as Watson's nerve center for the Congress. Scenic tour s were arranged for the after hours. 102 Watson had already declared that after the Berlin g athering he would travel to Italy for a private meeting with Mussolin i and that the next ICC"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"conference scheduled for 1939 would be held in Toky o, Germany's Pacific ally. IBM bad been cultivating a t h r i v i n g business in Japan, helping that nation develop its air force and aircraft carriers. 103 Greetings to the Berlin Congress were not only conv eyed by Hull, but this time President Roosevelt himself issued an off icial, if innocuous, felicita- tion. Again, such communications emphasized Watson' s primacy as much as I the event itself. \"My hearty congratulations and wa rmest greetings on your election as President of the International Chamber of Commerce,\" Roosevelt cabled the Adlon. \"For many years, I have followed with interest your efforts to advance the work of this organization. . . . You r Congress in Berlin is tak- ing place at a time when many serious problems call for wise and mature counsel. . . . On this very important occasion, I e xtend to you and to the par- ticipating delegations my best wishes for a success ful conclusion to the deliberations.\" 104 On June 28, 1937, over a peaceful cup of tea served in dainty china cups atop elegant saucers, in a quiet corner of the Reic h Chancellery, huddling over a small serving table and seated on cushy, flo ral armchairs, Watson and Hitler would finally talk. Sitting with them was a Hitler cohort and two other prominent Hitler supporters from the ICC convention . No one knows exactly what Hitler told Watson during their exchange. Wats on paraphrased it later for the New York Times as, \"There will be no war. N o country wants war, no country can afford it.\" 105 But no one really ever knew the exact exchange between the men. Whatever Hitler did say, Watson wa s encouraged and entranced. Later, the ICC thousands assembled at the German Op era House, which doubled as the Reichstag. Nazi flags fluttere d monumentally from the balconies as a massive orchestra played Beethoven's Lenore Overture #3. The New York Times reported, \"At times . . . it seeme d to be a purely National Socialist rally.\" 106 And then Adolf Hitler suddenly walked in. Dressed i n his familiar brown party uniform, he made his way direcdy to the royal box festooned with a swastika flag. As he did, the familiar comma nd crackled through the air: \"Sieg!\" 107 The assemblage of distinctive businessmen, includin g dozens from the United States of America, in the year 1937, gripped by the moment, awed by the occasion, imbued with the spirit, under the lea dership of Thomas J. Watson, jumped to their feet amid roars, cheers, an d wild applause, reached for the sky in a loyal salute and chanted back \"H eil!\" 108 Watson lifted"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"his right arm halfway up before he caught himself. Later, a colleague denied to a reported for the New York Herald that Watson's gesture was a genuine salute. 109 Hermann Goering was one of the first main speakers. He hammered at Nazi Germany's constant themes. The Third Reich's \"might y rearmament,\" Goering insisted, was merely to defend Germany's long borde rs and protect her honor. He demanded justice for Germany, and access to the raw materials she was entitled to. Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht i n his address also stressed \"honest raw material distribution.\" 110 Many more Nazi speakers argued their case, hopeful for appeasement if possible, committe d to conquest if necessary. Even Schacht, whose rhetoric was generally subdued, described racial prerogatives that arose from a \"Godgiven division o f nations according to race.\" 111 When the plenary finally dismissed, a signal was gi ven and the orchestra played the theme of the Storm Troopers, t he \"Horst Wessel Song\" and then the German national anthem, \"Deutschland uber Alles.\" Caught up in the hypnotic invigoration of it all, delegates sang alo ng with stalwart Brown Shirts. 112 Then the merriment began in earnest. Berlin had not seen so monarchical a reception in recent memory. Watson wa s wined, dined, and honored everywhere in Berlin. Josef and Magda Goebb els entertained the Watsons at the Opera House. The Schachts invited th e Watsons and delegates to a grand party for hundreds at the Berlin Palace. Th e Goerings hosted a majestic banquet for the Watsons and delegation presidents a t the immense Charlottenburg Palace. Berlin's mayor organized a s umptuous dinner for the delegates. 113 But all prior splendor was surpassed by the elabora te Venetian Nights staged by Goebbels on Peacock Island, an ext ravaganza thought by many to be the grandest party of the Nazi era. Loca ted a short drive from Berlin in pastoral Wannsee, Friedrich Wilhelm Ill's romant ic eighteenth-century castle on Peacock Island had been converted for the evenin g into an Arabesque fantasy at a cost of 4 million Reichsmarks. Watson and the other guests crossed to the isle atop a narrow pontoon bridge, which bro ught them to a long path lined with hundreds of charming Berlin schoolgirls daintily outfitted in white blouses over white silk breeches and white leather slippers. Each girl waved a white fairy's wand and angelically bowed as Watson and his fellow industrialists promenaded in. 114 Three thousand—some said four thousand— guests were then invited to imbibe at a bar of seem ingly endless length, manned by eighty bartenders pouring and mixing any cocktai l, vintage cognac, fine wine, or robust beer."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Corks popped continuously as champagne flowed with abandon. A regal din- ner remembered as gigantic was served to hundreds o f tables, each seating as many as twelve. Thousands of chefs, waiters, and their kitchen helpers whisked dome after dome of gourmet specialties back and forth across the lawns in a spectacular demonstration of precision t able service. Enchanting Prussian porcelain figurines were bestowed upon the wives. Ballerinas and singers from a nearby artist's colony performed an enchanted display of dance and song beneath a prodigious rotunda, which later became an im- mense dance floor. 115 But no fanfare could compare with the crowning mome nt, the decora- tion of Watson. Hitler's medal was bestowed by Scha cht as newsreel cameras whirred and government functionaries snapped to sti ff attention. The eight- pointed gold-framed cross of white enamel embedded with German eagles and Nazi emblems dangled about the neck from a broa d red, black, and white ribbon in tandem with a second six-pointed st ar worn over the left breast. To Watson, it was magnificent. When wearing it, he was draped by two swastikas, one to the right and one to the left . 116 The majesty and fantasy of Berlin 1937 swept Watson and IBM into an ever more entangled alliance—now not only in German y, but in every coun- try of Europe. Soon, the metallic syncopation of Ho llerith technology would echo across the continent. There were frightening n ew applications for punch cards in store, applications no civilized per son could envision. France, Poland, Italy, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Holland, N orway, Romania, Hungary, and the other nations would soon be set ablaze. Through it all, the songs never stopped. Swaying wi th exuberance, all dressed in one color, lyrics shouted in almost hypn otic fervor, the songs never stopped. Endicott reverberated with the prospects a s followers sang out. That's the spirit that has brought us fame! We're big, but bigger we will be. We can't fail for all can see. We fought our way through—and new Fields we're sure to conquer too.

But for those Jews remaining wit hin the Reich, existence became a progressively fainter shadow of its former self. Driven from the small cities, Jews began to flood into Berlin where they attempted to con- tinue a fraction of the civilized life they once kn ew. Small things became im- portant: a cup of coffee in a cafe, a stroll in the park, cinema on the weekend, an afternoon concert, these were the precious relic s of normalcy German Jewry clung to. But the Nazis would not permit a mo ment of peace. Jews were subjected to unending acts of personal degrada tion as they were mar- ginalized. The national humiliation effort was more than a cruelty unnoticed except within the borders of Germany. The campaign was the source of never-ending American newspaper articles and radio reports, including those in the New York Times. Nazis would enter cinemas and demand all Jews rise so they could be escorted out. Cafes catering to Jews were ordered c losed and the patrons taken into custody. Local authorities disbanded vir tually all Jewish athletic teams, musical societies, and social clubs. Indeed, any gathering of more than four Jews in a single place was forbidden. Placarde d park benches warned"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"that Jews could not sit down. S y n a g o g u e s were shuttered and often razed; the grand principal synagogue of Munich was replace d with a parking lot. 3 Hundreds of disenfranchised middle-class German Jews from the provinces tried to reestablish themselves in Berlin with small retail busi- nesses. Former boot manufacturers reappeared in sh oe shops. Liquidated apparel makers set up shop as haberdashers. Evicted professors opened bookstores. As soon as the Nazis discovered these s hoestring enterprises, customers were frightened away and the assets targe ted for confiscation. Jewish shops were defaced with painted epithets exc laiming \"Jewish Swine\" or \"Out with the Jews.\" Not infrequently, armed Sto rm Troopers blockaded the doorways. One day, the world awoke to headlines reporting a massive racist display as several miles of Berlin's main shopping streets were obstructed with crude, three-foot-high signs identi fying exacdy which stores were owned by Jews. 4 Nazi agitators always seemed to know if owners wer e Jewish, no matter how new the stores. Yet for the Hitler regime, the pace of Jewish destr uction was still not swift enough nor sufficiendy complete. Although Ger many's professing Jews had been identified, thousands of so-called \"racial Jews\" with Jewish ances- tors dating back to the prior century had yet to be marked. In 1937, the Reich ordered another nationwide census that would prepare the country for military mobilization, and for the Jews would be th e final and decisive identification step. Dehomag eagerly agreed to orga nize the project. 5 The racial portion of the census was designed to pi npoint ancestral Jews as defined by the Nuremberg Laws, ensuring no escape from the Reich's anti-Semitic campaign. In addition to the u sual census questions, a special card asked whether any of the individual's grandparents was Jewish, When completely filled out, the card would be isola ted in a separate enve- lope for processing by both the census authorities and security offices. 6 The project, originally scheduled for May 1938, wou ld be an enormous undertaking for IBM, requiring a huge expansion of manpower, machinery, and processing space. Seventy sorters, some sixty t abulators, seventy-six mul- tipliers, and 90 million punch cards would be neede d for the RM 3.5 million contract. IBM supervisors in Geneva, Stockholm, and New York understood how difficult the challenge would be. A memo from I BM's European Factory Manager J.G. Johnston to IBM NY supervisors in Swed en specified, \"we also have to raise considerable funds for the financing of the RM 3.5 million cen- sus order\" even though the Reich's payments would b e distributed over a fifteen-month period. Other IBM executives seemed t o sense that the fordi- coming racial census would represent a project so f ar-reaching, it would be"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"the last of its kind and therefore IBM's investment would have to plan for a temporary surge. \"You should take i n t o consideratio n . . . the fact that the German census order is a peak load which may not re occur.\" 7 The Nazi establishment was ecstatic about the impli cations for German Jewry. \"In May of next year,\" bragged the leading N SDAP newspaper Volkischer Beobachter, \"the largest and most compre hensive census will take place. It will be larger and more comprehensive tha n Germany, and even the rest of the world, has ever known.... it is the dut y of every Volks-comrade to answer every single question completely and truthfu lly . . . [thus] giving the Fuhrer and his colleagues the basis for the future legislation of the next five to ten years.\" 8 One Nazi bureaucrat enthused, \"The general census o f 1938 is intended to also determine the blood-wise configura tion of the German pop- ulation. . . . the results could also be recorded o n the police department's technical registration cards. The police would thus gain an insight into the racial composition of the persons living in their j urisdictions. And this would also accomplish the goals set by the Main Office of the Security Police.\" 9 But the much-anticipated May 1938 census was delaye d. On March 13, 1938, the Third Reich absorbed Austria, creating a Greater Germany of 73 million people. Hitler called it the Anschluss, or \"Annexation.\" The anti- Semitic program that had evolved over the years in Germany now rapidly took hold in the Austrian provinces—virtually overn ight. First came the vio- lence. Jewish merchants were rounded up and publicl y beaten, their stores looted. Viennese crowds cheered when Jewish men and women were forced to their knees to scrub streets as rifle butts flai led them. 10 Page one headlines in the New York Times immediatel y decried an \"Orgy of Jew-baiting.\" The article described sadist ic cruelties calculated to coerce Jews into immediately emigrating penniless t o anywhere. \"In Vienna and Austria,\" the New York Times declared, \"no vest ige of decency or human- ity has checked the will to destroy, and there has been an unbroken orgy of Jew-baiting such as Europe has not known since the darkest days of the Mid- dle Ages.\" 11 Then came the arrests. Thousands of Jews were extra cted from their homes and offices, loaded onto wagons, and shipped to concentration camps, such as Dachau, where they suffered bestial torture s, starvation, and back- breaking labor. The camps, too, were designed to co nvince Austrian Jews to leave the country—should they ever be released from incarceration. And only those who promised to emigrate at once were even co nsidered for release. 12 When the pace of emigration was not quick enough, J ews in the Aus-"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"trian provinces were simply expelled from their hom es with no notice. More than 3,000 Jewish men, women, an d children in the B urgenland region of Austria, many with roots dating back centuries, wer e loaded onto trucks, driven to the Jewish quarter of Vienna, and summari ly dumped. The Vienna Jewish community housed them in synagogues and othe r buildings as best they could, but the weather was unusually cold and many of the children suffered extreme exposure and near starvation from the ordeal. 13 On June 30, 1938, nearly 10,000 Jewish-owned busine sses in Austria were ordered to immediately fire all Jewish employe es—30,000 men and women—and replace them with Aryans. The mass media described \"heart- breaking scenes\" across Vienna as trusted Jewish em ployees—many of ten- and twenty-year tenure—were suddenly ousted without war ning or severance. 14 Expulsions, exclusions, and confiscations raged acr oss Vienna, stripping Jewish citizens of their dignity, possessions, and legal status. No one was spared. Middle-class Jews from Sigmund Freud to nam eless victims were forced to board any ship, train, or bus out of Aust ria with no possessions other than what they could carry. 15 Once Jews were identified, their lives in Austria were over. Suicide became a frequent alternative. In the first 10 days of German annexation, ninety-six persons committed suicide. A s more Jews found them- selves dispossessed or facing the prospect of Dacha u, they entered into sui- cide pacts and even suicide clubs. 16 With stunning precision, the Nazis knew exacdy who in Austria was Jewish. Indeed, the New York Times, in its initial coverage of the round-ups, could not help but comment, \"Many of these patrols are engaged in round- ing up the thousands on lists of those due for impr isonment and 'correction.' These lists were compiled quiedy year after year in preparation for the day of Germany's seizure of power.\" 17 IBM was in Austria. Before Hitler came to power, th e company was rep- resented only by an agency called Furth & Company, operated in part by Stephan Furth. But in 1933, after Hitler declared t he Third Reich, Watson established a wholly-owned IBM subsidiary in Austri a. Furth then went to the United States to undergo sales training with IB M in New York. Shortly thereafter, Furth returned to Vienna as co-manager of the new wholly- owned IBM subsidiary. That subsidiary had the benef it of one of IBM's most talented punch card engineers, Gustav Tauschek, and Manager Victor Furth. Another Dehomag-trained manager named Berthold late r joined Furth. In 1934, IBM undertook the Austrian census, and two ye ars later, Watson ap- proved a card printing plant for the country. 18 "},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"In early 1938, in the weeks leading up to the March Anschluss, Adolf Eichmann was dispatched to Vienna as a specialist o n Jewish affairs to organ- ize forced Jewish emigration. Once in Vienna, he fo und an enormous punch card operation working around the clock. The Holler ith program superseded every other aspect of German preparations. 19 \"For weeks in advance [of the Anschluss],\" remembe red Eichmann \"every able-bodied man they could find was put to w ork in three shifts: writ- ing file cards for an enormous circular card file, several yards in diameter, which a man sitting on a piano stool could operate and find any card he wanted thanks to a system of punch holes. All infor mation important for Aus- tria was entered on these cards. The data was taken from annual reports, handbooks, the newspapers of all the political part ies, membership files; in short, everything imaginable. . . . Each card carri ed name, address, party membership, whether Jew, Freemason or practicing Ca tholic or Protestant; whether politically active, whether this or whether that. During that period, our regular work was put on ice.\" 20 The German racial census scheduled for May 1938 was postponed a year to allow Dehomag to draw up new plans to count the population of Aus- tria as well. Dehomag opened several additional bra nches throughout the greater Reich to accommodate the extra load. More t han twenty-five offices would tackle the task of profiling the expanded bas e of some 70 million Ger- mans and Austrians. 21 Hitler's reign of terror against the Jews continued throughout 1938 to the continuing astonishment of the world. The final stage of confiscation was launched on April 27 as the Reich ordered Jews to r egister virtually all pos- sessions. 22 Hollerith machines were kept busy tabulating asset s. Conditions in Nazi Germany became ever more nightma rish. Behead- ing was adopted as the dreaded new punishment of th e unappealable Peo- ples' Court, which adjudicated in secret but announ ced its executions to the world media as a warning to all those the Reich con sidered special enemies. Scores of ghasdy concentration camps were opened th roughout the Greater Reich, each spawning its own infamy of cruel tortur e and degradation de- picted in the newsreels and magazines of the day. M ob violence during the day, a dreaded knock on the door in the middle of t he night, humiliating public campaigns, and endless decrees forcing Jews further into starvation and impoverishment rained terror on Jewish existenc e in the Greater Reich. 23 World revulsion against Germany was inspired not ju st by its anti- Semitic outrages, but by a continuous assault of hi ghly publicized oppression"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"against Catholics, Protestant church groups, in tellectuals, and others the Nazis did not agree with. 24 Hitler's war menacing clearly identified Czecho- slovakia for imminent takeover. Poland and France seemed next. Many thought it was just a matter of time before Europe re-ignited into a total war that America would be compelled to enter. It became increasingly hard for anyone to argue Germany's case, even euphemisticall y in code. Then came the turning point for Americans and indeed the worl d: Kristallnacht—The Night of the Broken Glass. November 10, 1938, on the twentieth anniversary of Germany's sur- render in the Great War, all Germany exploded into a national pogrom of depravity and violence against Jews heretofore not seen. The Reich's pretext was the assassination of a German consular official in Paris by a despondent Jewish refugee. Within hours of the news, disciplin ed cadres of shock troops driving in open cars, directed by uniformed SA lead ers, with merciless syn- chony, deployed in virtually every town and city of the Third Reich during the early hours. Almost on cue, Hitler's Germany er upted into a tempest of shattered glass. Store panes, display cases, fixtur es, office doors, and ordinary windows—if it was glass, the Nazis smashed it. Syna gogues, cafes, schools, offices, homes—wherever there was unexcised Jewish presence, the Brown Shirts, struck. 25 Then Jewish possessions were systematically ripped, splattered, and looted. Brown Shirts spread Torahs across the groun d and danced upon the scrolls. Furniture was thrown into the street. Valu ables were carted away as trophies. Pictures, books, and curtains were torn. 26 Kerosene came next. Floors and drapes were methodic ally doused. An enthusiastic drenching was reserved for Torahs, pra yer shawls, holy books, and devotional bimahs in synagogues. Tossed matches . Rolled incendiary bombs. Lobbed petrol bombs. Nearly everything Jewis h was set aflame. Not just in Berlin. Not just in Vienna. In every town a nd city of the Third Reich. 27 More than 15,000 Jews dragged from their homes were brutalized before the cheering onlookers, herded into trucks, dispatched to jails, and in many cases, direcdy to concentration camps. Firemen watched the flames with laughter, taking care that neighboring Aryan s tructures were unaffected. Policemen studiously directed traffic, allowing the marauders complete free- dom of operation. 28 Here among the ruins was the final overnight summar y of Jewish exist- ence in Germany and a prophecy for their bleak fate in Europe. Jewish life would ultimately be incinerated everywhere. The con sequences of identifica-"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"tion had been irrevocably unmasked. Whatever doubt the world had about the intentions of the Hitler regime, that doubt vap orized with the curls of smoke rising from hundreds of synagogues and Jewish offices in Germany. Newspapers, newsreels, a n d radio broadcasts across the globe burned with headlines condemning Hitler's Reich as savage and barbarous. The New York Times printed a tall page one banner headline: \"Nazis Smash, Loot and Burn Jewish Shops and Temples.\" The newspaper telli ngly noted that tin- only Vienna synagogue not torched was one \"that the authorities have pro tected . . . because it contains records of the Jew ish community of Vienna that could not be replaced.\" 29 Washington recalled its ambassador from Berlin. Wes tern diplomats called for concerted action to stem the anti-Semiti c outrages. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a sharply worded denun ciation in which he per- sonally penned the words, \"I myself could scarcely believe that such tilings could occur in a twentieth century civilization.\" G allup Polls asked whether Hitler could be believed when he said he had no mor e territorial ambitions in Europe beyond Czechoslovakia; 92 percent of Amer ican respondents and 93 percent of British respondents declared Hitler c ould not be believed. Hitler's followers in America had already been pros ecuted in high-profile cases under various civil rights statutes. Now, the term \"Nazi sympathizer\" became widely used. And Nazi collaboration and prop agandizing was deemed sufficiently subversive and \"un-American\" th at eventually a special Congressional committee investigated. 30 American reaction to the riots was almost wholly di sregarded by Hitler. After Kristallnacht, Jews were forced to vacate the ir apartments, sometimes on just a few days' notice, as Hitler loyalists que ued up to move in. In Munich, all Jewish families were given just forty-e ight hours to permanently leave the city. The order was soon rescinded as imp ossible—although later the demand was re-imposed. Jews were collectively f ined 1 billion marks for inciting the Kristallnacht riots. And the last phas es of confiscation and asset registration were set in motion. 31 The German government issued dire warning after dir e warning that the situation could worsen. But a New York Times fe ature on November 14, 1938, ominously asked, \"Inasmuch as everything has been done to the Jews in Germany that can be done to a people short of ph ysical extermination, there are arising some obvious speculations as to w hat these continued warn- ings may imply.\" The question was answered just day s later on November 30, when the newspaper published an article headlined \" Jews in Germany Get"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Extermination Threat,\" quoting the Schwarze Korps, the organ of Hitler's SS, as it advertised the potential for wholesale Jewish murder. 12 Watson had visited Germany twice in 1938, once in l ate May, just after the Anschluss of Austria, and once in early October , during the tense build-up to Kristallnacht. 33 Germany was threatening invasion daily. War prepara tions were no secret. Reich propagandists spread the word, ensuri ng headlines and de- bates. Commanders fortified borders. Mobilization p lans were disseminated. Aircraft engineers received special awards for new bomber and fighter designs. Passenger trains were restricted so rail s tock could be devoted to troop movements. Housewives were publicly asked to dramatically reduce consumption of fats to save money so the Reich coul d purchase raw materi- als urgently needed for its weapons production. 34 War was in the air. Yet, throughout the year, Watson argued passionatel y for Germany's demands. He barely made an appearance at an interna tional commercial meeting, university commencement ceremony, ribbon-c utting, or press con- ference without reiterating his well-worn Hitleresq ue appeal that the world \"redistribute its raw materials\" and lower so-calle d \"trade barriers\" as \"the path to peace.\" This public lobbying was undertaken even as the mass media regularly published articles and broadcast explanat ions that Germany des- perately only needed those raw materials to arm her war machine. Even though Watson's pronouncements sounded to many as m ere code for the Nazi agenda, he held fast to his script. More than that, whenever Watson returned from a tour of the Continent, his dockside remarks always spoke glowingly of the optimism throughout Europe and the steadily increased standard of living for all—this at a time when the world was teetering on the brink of total war and witnessing the dispossession of the Jews. 35 Prominent writers and personalities would rebut Wat son's brand of t h i n k i n g . One foreign correspondent in the New York Times reflected the common view when he wrote, \"It must be remembered . . . the series of boy- cotts due to worldwide resentment against German do mestic policies ... play almost as large a part as do the trade barriers.\" I n May 1938, just after the Anschluss and just before sailing to Germany, Watso n answered such senti- ments. \"Unjust criticism of business is a trade bar rier,\" he lectured his fellow industrialists at an ICC gathering, adding, \"Unjust criticism of government is another trade barrier.\" 36 For Watson, whatever Hitler was doing to the Jews a nd other perceived enemies of the Third Reich was no obstacle to reali zing profit on Germany's"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"plans. \"You know, you can cooperate w i t h a man with out believing in every- thing he says and does,\" Watson sermonized to his f ollowers after one trip to Germany, adding, \"If you do not agree with everythi ng he does, cooperate with him in the things you do believe in. Others wi ll cooperate with him in the things they believe in.\" On another occasion, W atson illuminated his steeled indifference this way: \"I am an American ci tizen. But in the IBM I am a world citizen, because we do business in 78 count ries and they all look alike to me—every one of them.\" 37 Yet when Watson's ocean liner anchored at New York just days after the November 10 Kristallnacht outrage, it was all diffe rent. IBM's Leader finally realized that American sentiment had become so extr emely anti-Nazi, he now needed to distance himself from the very regime he had so publicly saluted.

This, I am still most anxious to do; but upon my recent return to my country after an absence of sev eral months I find a change in public sentiment and a loss of good will to your country, and unless something can be done to bring about a more friendly under- standing on the part of our people, I feel it is go ing to be difficult to accomplish mutually satisfactory results in connect ion with our trade relations. The change in sentiment referred to has been brough t about through the decisions of your Government in dealing with minorities, and I respectfully appeal to you to give considerat ion to applying the Golden Rule in dealing with these minorities. I have read with the greatest interest the statemen t that your Gov- ernment is prepared to make arrangements with a com mittee of lead- ing Quakers to assist German Jews in the spirit of charity and the Golden Rule, I venture, therefore, to accept this a ct as a symbol of will- ingness on your part to grant more generous treatme nt to minorities. If your Excellency would follow up this act of kind liness with poli- cies inspired by its humanitarian effort, it would, in my opinion, be the one way by which those interested in the exchange o f goods and serv- ices and high ideals might find the opportunity to help Germany regain the valuable trade and good-will which she has lost . Very respectfully yours, Thomas Watson 40 Watson would be able to show his direct and unequiv ocal protest letter to anyone as evidence of vociferous objection to Hi tler's anti-Semitism. Pre- sumably the letter could be exhibited with the same flourish Watson em- ployed in displaying other letters to and from worl d leaders, some of which he routinely carried in his inside suit pocket.

But somehow, Watson's explicit letter to Hi tler was . . . misaddressed. Watson could always say it had been mailed. But in truth the Post Office returned it—unopened. Watson's secretary tried agai n four months later. 41 People of conscience throughout the world were outr aged at the Hitler regime. Yet Germany was on the verge of expanding i ts use of Hollerith sys- tems to an unprecedented level. Watson needed to co ver himself in the Reich and at home. He would now pursue a strange public p osture, essentially speaking from both sides of the punch card. Deftly, he would mix his mes- sages of subtle advocacy for Reich territorial and economic hegemony with patriotic assertions supporting American defense me asures, and almost polly- annaish aphorisms offered to Germany about its brut al anti-Semitism. Wat- son would always be able to point to out-of-context portions of his remarks to satisfy any audience—be it those listening in th e Nazi Reich or the United States. At the same time, all mention of Germany as the linchpin of IBM's overseas operation was conspicuously dropped from I BM press statements. For example, just after Kristallnacht, when Watson returned from Europe, his usual dockside remarks to the media listed the many countries he had visited, including Greece, Italy, Romania, Portugal , Turkey, and France. But Germany was not mentioned—the first time since the rise of Hitler that Wat- son had omitted the country name from his proudly d etailed itineraries. A newspaper article about IBM's foreign employees stu dying at the company sales school in Endicott spoke of students from twe nty-four countries. Yet Germany's name was the only one not listed—again, t he first time the Reich's place in IBM's international commerce was omitted, even though, as usual, representatives from Germany were there. 42 Platitudes were dispensed in abundance. \"World Peac e through World Trade\" became Watson's official jingo to explain aw ay IBM trading with Nazi Germany. Beckoning Hitler to please \"observe the Go lden Rule\" paled as a schoolboy-like admonishment in the face of the ruth less torture and dispos- session gripping German Jewry. But Watson was an ex pert at calculated pub- lic pronouncements on troublesome topics. When he f irst assumed the helm of the IBM organization—back in the CTR days—he sch eduled a company assembly to demonstratively and publicly lecture hi s sales force, \"You must not do anything that's in restraint of trade . . . or that could be construed by anybody as unfair competition.\" Ironically, these s tern moralistic directives were conspicuously broadcast just at the height of the Justice Department's decision-making process on re-prosecuting Watson fo r his role in one of America's most aggravated cases of anti-competitive tactics. 43 "},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"So, at the same time the IBM Leader was advocating \"the Golden Rule,\" he wrote a letter to the world's governments urging them to \"collabo- rate regardless of divergent ideals and opinions\" t o avoid war. In interna- tional economic forums, he asserted \"the divine rig ht of every people to choose its own government\" and demanded \"adjustment s that would give all countries an opportunity to share in the resources of the world.\" 44 Watson's choice of words bore the unmistakable ring of Germa ny's party line, which likewise demanded that it be allowed to share in al l of Europe's natural resources for the greater glory of the Reich. None of Watson's public posturing stopped him from accelerating Dehomag's ability to do Hitler's bidding throughout Europe—so long as IBM could keep its distance and Watson could remain removed from the process. In late May 1938, shortly after Germany an nexed Austria, Watson visited Berlin on Dehomag business. Watson requeste d Dehomag's manage- ment to prepare to extend its operations into Austr ia, thus replacing the existing subsidiary controlled by IBM NY. Dehomag w as going to develop some unique tabulating equipment, based on its powe rful new D-11, engi- neered for special applications that could generat e significant revenues. However, these new efforts would have an impact on complicated issues of profit sharing, tax, bonus, and general compensatio n—all of which Watson wanted carefully negotiated. 45 More and more, Watson tried to work through interme diaries. The negotiation itself was delayed until shortly after Watson left Germany. Then, on the morning of June 24, 1938, Dehomag convened a shareholder meeting attended by two Geneva-based IBM executives represe nting the New York office. Although Watson was not there, he controlle d the decisions from afar through his 85 percent vote, cast through his Europ ean General Manager John E. Holt who held a power-of-attorney. Point si x of the minutes called for negotiations \"as soon as possible.\" 46 It was left to a member of the IBM NY's board of di rectors, Oscar L. Gubelman, to work out the details of Dehomag's expa nsion into Austria, along with certain loan provisions and stock option s as inducements for Dehomag Directors Rottke and Hummel. Gubelman agree d that the direc- tors' loan provisions and stock options could be in corporated into a formal supplemental employment contract, but the Austrian expansion itself was to be kept as an oral arrangement recorded only by mem o. On July 6, 1938, Rottke and Hummel jointly confirmed the oral arrang ement in a letter to Gubelman, who was staying at Berlin's Hotel Adlon. Their letter listed three main points: \"a) New Products, b) New Territories, c) reduction of [stock]"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"repurchase price in case of premature leaving the D ehomag due to notice of resignation.\" 47 The j o i n t Dehomag l e t t e r acknowledged New York's pr imacy in no uncertain terms. \"IBM,\" the letter emphasized, reta ins \"unlimited power to dispose of such new products, and in view of its [I BM's] position within Dehomag, is absolutely in a position, even without our express declaration of assent, on its part to formulate the conditions for the inclusion of Dehomag in such new business.\" 48 Only IBM NY could authorize Dehomag to develop new products or expand into Austria, but if it did so, the business would be maintained sepa- rately from the regular books and would appear inst ead as loan or bonus transactions. Dehomag's confirmation letter express ed the understanding in cautious, stilted language. For New Products: \"It h as been orally agreed,\" the letter recited, \"and is confirmed herewith by us in writing, in case IBM entrusts Dehomag with the sale and/or manufacture o f new products which lie outside the present scope of business of the De homag and also do not come under the license agreement between the Dehoma g and the IBM, we agree that upon the request of the IBM, we can be t otally or partly excluded from the results of the business transactions in th ese new products, as they have been agreed upon in the form of a bonus in the loan agreements and supplementary agreements concluded between the Deho mag and us.\" 49 For New Territories: \"In case the IBM should volunt arily transfer the working of territories outside of Germany to the De homag, we also agree that, upon the request of the IBM, we can be totall y or partly excluded from the results of the business transactions in these n ew territories as they have been agreed upon in the form of a bonus in the loan agreements and supple- mentary agreements concluded between the Dehomag an d us.\" 50 The letter added, \"After careful deliberation, you have considered it proper to let the points a) [New Products] and b) [ New Territories] be dealt with merely in this letter in the sense of our disc ussion, while point c) will be included in the supplementary agreement.\" Rottke an d Hummel's letter con- cluded with their gratitude for helping the Reich: \"We confidently hope that the contents of this letter will convince Mr. Watso n . . . that we see our life's task in our present work and sincerely wish to cont ribute to the development of the Dehomag for many years to come. We thank you very much for the great assistance you have given in this matter.\" 51 Although the arrangement to expand Dehomag was hand led through intermediaries, Watson micro-managed every detail. On August 2, 1938, Wat- son sent a letter to John Holt, IBM's European gene ral manager, confirming"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"approval of both the loan additions to the employme nt contracts and the spe- cial letter about the expansion. \"Mr. Gubelman has handed me the final draft of the proposed amendment to the Rottke-Hummel cont racts,\" wrote Wat- son, \"and also the letter from Rottke-Hummel addres sed to Mr. Gubelman as a Director, dated July 6, 1938..,. You are authoriz ed to sign for IBM.\" 52 The scene was set for Dehomag to immediately expand into every new Nazi-conquered nation, so long as IBM approved in a dvance. Austria was only the beginning, and IBM understood it well. On August 4, 1938, J.C. Milner, a Geneva-based IBM supervisor of Dehomag, w rote to J. T. Wilson, the manager of IBM NY's so-called Foreign Division, explaining, \"Rottke has made arrangements . . . which include equipment for seven or eight different countries to fill customers orders.\" The letter add ed that Dehomag could not fill all the orders from its inventory, so \"five or six sets of Valtat equipment ... we shall have shipped [from the U.S.] to the fr eeport at Geneva.\" 53 A key mission for Dehomag machines was census in ne ighboring coun- tries. \"During 1940, the census will be taken in se veral countries,\" Milner's August 4 letter confirmed, \"and we expect a number of orders.\" He added, \"One of the problems which confronts us is that of providing special machines for census work. . . . Since Endicott has discontinued manufactur- ing the Printing Counting Sorter, we do not seem to have any machine par- ticularly adapted to census work. As you know, Germ any does construct a Census Tabulator, and we have always figured on bei ng able to get the machines from them for forthcoming work.\" But produ ction in Germany was backlogged and was becoming less economical because of Reich currency restrictions. 54 So Milner wondered whether Endicott wanted to devel op its own cen- sus tabulator capable of high-speed counting, conti nue to rely on the Ger- man version, or perhaps produce them in another Eur opean country and ship them on Dehomag's behalf. \"If Endicott does no t propose to undertake such work,\" he wrote in the August 4, 1938, letter, \"it is quite possible that we shall have to look into the situation in France, and see whether they can economically construct a machine equivalent to the German Census Tabu- lator.\" 55 IBM NY now began viewing its various subsidiaries throughout Europe as coordinated to support Dehomag's operatio n. Moreover, IBM NY wanted to maintain strict controls on each and every Dehomag lease. Special rebates and discounts for Reich operations could not be extended unless approved by New York. J. T. Wilson sent a memo to IBM's Europe headquarters on August 25, 193 8, entitled \"Ship- ment of German Machines Beyond Germany,\" demanding to know whether"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"corporate controller in Geneva were setting prices for machines shipped beyond the bolders of Germany. W i l s o n wanted to mak e sure the proper mark-up above coil was preserved. That same day he sent a second letter off to Harrison Chauncey, another IBM NY management tro ubleshooter in Europe, explaining, \"Their costs are very much high er than our costs at Endi- cott. For instance, the cost of building a Sorter i n Germany is $292, while the cost at Endicott is $220.\" 56 Holt replied to Wilson, \"We have a fixed charge ... and do not take into consideration whether it comes from the United Stat es, or Germany, or another factory.\" He added, however, that \"in the c ase of special machines, such as [Dehomag's] D-11, we have always set prices which are, we believe, somewhat higher than the United States would charge ... . Since the German company has a schedule of rebates to its customers of which you are well aware, in taking a special German machine and placi ng it in a foreign coun- try, we have always tried to approach the net Germa n price, using the official rate of exchange.\" 57 Holt offered an example. \"In other words,\" he wrote , \"should a machine be supplied to Holland, we would . . . add 25%, and [then] add a further 10%.\" But Holt made unequivocally clear that IBM NY controlled pricing on all of Germany's machines. \"[I]n all cases, we set the prices, and Germany does not.\" 58 Complicating all IBM efforts to profit on Dehomag's Europe-wide sales in fall 1938 was yet another Reich monetary decree. Germany was nearing bankruptcy. The anti-Nazi boycott had virtually cri ppled a once-thriving export-dependent Reich economy. Despite desperate c ashless barter efforts to boost foreign sales and unverifiable trade stati stics to the contrary, Ger- many's currency-earning exports were down to the Un ited States by as much as 95 percent for many commercial sectors. Schacht had confided as much to Watson at the 1937 ICC Congress. 59 Without foreign exchange, Hitler could not rearm. So it was hardly a surprise to IBM when the Third Reich prohibited exports by German companies unless they earned actual cash. In other words, Dehomag could no longer ship Holler ith machines across its borders and then forward the sales income to IB M NY as so-called debt repayment. \"As you are aware,\" IBM's Milner in Geneva wrote Wi lson in New York, in an early August 1938 letter, \"for a number of ye ars we have been able to charge such goods against the debts owing to IBM in New York, but this per- mission has now been withdrawn by the Government.\" Milner added that the arrangement was a surprise even to IBM auditors. \"P rice Waterhouse people"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"in Berlin... stated it was most unusual and they di d not know of any other foreign concern who had the same privilege.\" 60 Nonetheless, \"I'm sorry to tell you,\" M i l n e r lamen ted, \"that we have just been advised by Mr. Rottke that from now on it will not be possible to ship tabulating equipment and other goods out of Ge rmany to our various countries without the German company receiving paym ent for the goods.\" 61 Hence, profits would not only be trapped in German blocked mark ac- counts, other IBM subsidiaries in Europe acting as intermediaries for Deho- mag would have to transfer foreign currency to Berl in to complete the transaction. Moreover, Dehomag income in Europe, unless somehow shrouded, might now subject IBM profits to double taxation. D ouble taxation was a particular irritant to Watson, and he had worked fo r years to legislate a solu- tion. IBM Geneva's M. G. Connally, a key Dehomag au ditor, revealed the company's attitude to a U.S. State Department offic er earlier in 1938. He let it slip that \"some concerns have actually resorted to the fiction of royalties in order to avoid taxation,\" but quickly added, that i n the case of IBM, \"no such fiction existed and that royalties are the result o f clearly worded contracts.\" 62 More than just controlling which machines would b e distributed throughout Europe, and at what price, IBM understoo d by fall 1938 that it was now an integral part of the Nazi war machine. W ilson circulated on August 25, 1938, a memo to senior management in the New York office, reviewing problems in exporting machines from Germa ny. \"As you know,\" Wilson informed, \"both brass and copper and alloys play a big part in the mechanism of all of our machines and these metals a re very scarce in Ger- many, at least, I am told they require them for war materials.\" 63 Indeed, by 1937, the Reich concluded that punch car d technology was too important to its plan for Europe not to be stri ctly regulated. Henceforth, machines would be rationed only to those users appr oved by the military. In 1937, a secret unit was created within the Reich Wa r Ministry's Office of Mili- tary Economy. The department became known under the innocuous name Maschinelles Berichtwesen, or Office of Automated R eporting, and was dedi- cated to one main function: punch card technology. This agency went through several bureaucratic metamorphoses, chiefly through the Reich Min- istry for Armaments and War Production. The Maschin elles Berichtwesen, also known as the MB, wielded complete control over the ordering, sale, use, reporting, and coordination of all Hollerith system s in Greater Germany. It worked in complete tandem with all aspects of Hitle r's campaigns in Europe, opening so-called \"field offices\" in conquered coun tries. 64 "},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"From the Reich's point fo view, punch card technolo gy would be indis- pensable to its war-making capability. A February 1 938 secret military report declared that \"technologizing t h e Wehrniacht [armed forces]\" was impera- tive. The report listed the continual regimentation , tracking, and redeploy- ment of the general population, work force, and mil itary personnel, as best accomplished by Hollerith systems. \"A punch card sy stem,\" the MB report concluded, \"must be introduced for the statistical survey of workers and for shifting workers\" to create \"perfectly structured p ersonnel planning.\" 65 A later memo from the Office of Military Economy ca lled for a universal punch code system. The document reviewed Dehomag's many prior efforts, such as the census, labor statistics, and the Work Book, but that these \"all have the disadvantage of existing for singular purp oses and being incompati- ble with each other.\" The report made clear, \"it is impossible to reliably sepa- rate industrial demand for armament purposes from t otal industrial demand. The punch card is appropriate for the solution of t his problem,\" adding, \"The punch card does not replace all considerations, jud gments and decisions, but it makes them easier.\" 66 While it was obvious to all that Germany was prepar ing for imminent war, it was also apparent that the Reich was aggres sively utilizing statistics and punch card technology to track Jews and impleme nt its program of per- secution. \"Statistics issued today show that 12,094 Jews left Berlin last year for Palestine, Great Britain and the Americas,\" led a July 4, 1937, New York Times article datelined Berlin, adding, \"The statis tics are confined to 'Jews by faith,' the authorities declaring that Jews by race alone could be included in such records.\" Wire services regularly reported on the facts of Nazi demo- graphic tracking: religion percentages based on cen sus returns; quotas on goods Jews could purchase; an August 17, 1938, regu lation compelling all identified Jews whose names did not \"sound Jewish\" to add the first name Israel or Sara. 67 Newspapers, on May 15, 1938, listed a number of lar ge cities outside Berlin and exactly how much their Jewish population had decreased through the end of 1937. Nuremberg had 7,502 Jews in 1933, but only 4,000 in 1937. Worms went from 1,016 Jews in 1933 to 549 in 1937. Hagen dropped from 508 to 299. 68 Nazi raceology was becoming an all encompassing obs ession evident on virtually every street and within every organiza tion in Germany. A June 22, 1938, New York Times article reported, \"twenty- six research organizations have been established throughout the Reich which go from family to family\""},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"to identify bloodline. Wire services informed that the curriculum for all Ger- man medical students had been altered to include ma ndatory courses on race science and population policy. Local prosecuto rs could order compul- sory divorces of Jews and Aryans. At the same time, hundreds of thousands of marriages of urban Aryan women to what the Germa ns termed \"virile, hereditary\" farmers were required by Nazi demograph ers to achieve popula- tion health; the authorities began combing factorie s and offices for state- mandated brides. 69 Few in America outside of IBM understood that thes e highly publicized racial policies were facilitated by Dehomag's population, health office, and labor office tabulations. Personal data that could not be tabulated by an org anization for lack of an on-site Hollerith system were assembled on simpl e handwritten cards, forms, or copied onto registries that were forwarde d to race offices and secu- rity services for punching and sorting. Churches we re among the leading sources of such information. Their antique, ornatel y bound church books were often bulky and difficult to work with so supp ly companies developed a variety of index cards in various sizes designed to facilitate the tracing of ancestry. Often the process was awkward and anythin g but fast. 70 One small church office in Braunlage in the Harz Mo untains was typical when it complained in a letter to the Reichssippena mt, the Reich's leading raceology agency, that the cards were too small and the data too large. \"We have received samples of cards for the carding of c hurch books,\" wrote Pas- tor Stich. \"Once we started to work with these card s, we noticed that these are rather small. . . . For [those of] us who are d oing the work and bearing the costs, it is important we record not just some of the data, but all of the data, so that each card gives complete information about ancestry. ... we are not served well if we have to open and move the pag es of the heavy and irre- placeable church books.\" Pastor Stich asked for lar ger index cards, making clear, \"We are glad to serve the cause ... and read y to do the job right.\" 71 The Reichssippenamt prompdy replied, 'The primary f unction of the carding of church books is that it makes the resear ch easier and at the same time preserves the church book. . . . if you follow my guidelines for an alpha- betical name index then use of the church books its elf should be reduced by a factor of fifty.\" 72 Local NSDAP leadership in Diisseldorf debated wheth er cards should be filed phonetically or alphabetically. Either way , the office felt it wise to color code the cards. \"Whenever full Jews or mixed Jews appear,\" a local official wrote, \"the former are marked by a red lin e, the latter by a blue line."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"However, both also receive a tab. Without the tab, the red and blue li nes could otherwise not be easily identified after the sorting and filing has taken place.\" 73 Detailed instructions were developed for recording baptisms to make sure Jews could not hide their identity through con version. \"For every Jew- ish baptism,\" the instructions read, \"two double ca rds are to be filled out in addition to the normal card. (One for the Reichssip penamt and one for the file of Persons of Foreign Descent in the Berlin central office). With name changes (for example, the Jew Israel receives the f amily name Leberecht through baptism), the Christian or Jewish name is t o be entered in parenthe- ses in the field for family name.\" The name was the n coded R, and the Jew's occupation and address were to be written on the re verse side. 74 To help standardize methods, the Publishing House o f Registry Office Matters published a guide entitled How Do I Card Ch urch Books? 75 So precise were the tabulations that, in some areas , the authorities had identified people considered \"sixteenth Jews.\" The county of Bautzen, for example, summarized its extensive race tracking in a December 5, 1937 study, bragging that it had expanded the local Race Political Office from four employees to twenty-one during the previous two and a half years, with addi- tional race experts deployed in local Party offices as well as women's associa- tions. \"For the entire county area,\" officials asse rted, \"there exists a file for Jews, Half-Jews, Quarter-Jews, Eighth-Jews, etc. wi th the following informa- tion: name, residence, occupation, date of birth, p lace of birth, citizenship, religion .. . spouse, children, ancestors.\" As a re sult, local officials had identi- fied 92 [full] Jews, 40 half-Jews, 19 quarter-Jews, 5 eighth-Jews, and 4 sixteenth-Jews \"whose connections are continuously observed.\" 76 Race offices developed a mutual help network that c onstandy traded and updated their data. For example, Bautzen's info rmation collection was helped by registries from the State Health Offices; those offices were tabu- lated by Hollerith systems. In June 1938, 339 local labor offices took a so-called \"labor census\" of 22,300,000 German worke rs employed in approx- imately 247 occupational groups and subsets; the la bor agencies also exchanged information assembled by Dehomag. Eichman n's office Referat II 112, the Jewish Section of the Main Security Office , traded its synagogue and church sects lists with the Reichssippenamt., b oth offices used Hollerith systems. 77 The exponential growth of demand for Dehomag servic es spurred Wat- son to push his entire organization to manufacture more German machines faster. He even pushed his German managers at Dehom ag to break produc-"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"tion records. In mid-June, Watson agreed to add equ ipment and work space if the German subsidiary could double its output IB M managers in Paris monitored Dehomag's monthly progress, and asked for hard numbers. By the end of 1937, Rottke was able to report to IBM that monthly punch card pro- duction was at 74 million per month, production of horizontal sorters would double from 15 to 30 per month, tabulating machines would increase from 18 per month to 20 per month, multiplying punches w ould double from 5 to 10 per month, and counters would rise from 200 to 2 50 per month. 78 To speed production, IBM approved the purchase of m ore machine tools for the assembly shops. Three inclinable pres ses, a jig bore, five 6-spindle drill presses, four vertical drill presse s, five bench drills, and a vari- ety of milling machines, saws, grinders, lathes, an d screw presses. 79 In early June 1938, IBM again pushed for greater pr oductivity. Holt reminded IBM's Paris-based European Factory Manager J G. Johnston, \"Mr. Watson states that you told him last year . . . it sh ould be possible to produce twice the number of parts [at Sindelfingen] . . . M r. Rottke informs us that only 60% of the parts are now being manufactured at Sindelfingen.\" John- ston traveled to Berlin immediately, and reported b ack in minute detail on proposed expansion plans, explaining on a veritable floor-by-floor basis which improvements had been approved by Watson, and which were still awaiting permission. Watson's consent was required for even the smallest change in factory layout. For example, wrote Johnst on, \"if we should obtain the authorization of Mr. Watson for the shaded part of the plan for the new building, we could expect an increase of 3 x 462 sq . meters or a total of 1,386 sq. meters space . . . which increase would b e sufficient for our needs for some length of time.\" 80 Johnston assured Holt, \"The figure of 60 of the tot al output of parts now being manufactured in Sindelfingen will be grea dy increased.\" He stressed that many of the new machine tools were ju st being delivered and would be brought on line soon. 81 More machines would be built—faster, better, cheaper. Europe was hurtling toward all-out war. Dehomag wou ld be ready. CZECHOSLOVAKIA WAS NEXT. Hitler, in 1938, demanded the largely Germanic Sude tenland region of Czechoslovakia be handed to the Reich. Not only wer e there 3 million German-speaking residents in the Sudetenland, but C zechoslovakia pos- sessed the raw materials that Hitler coveted. Germa n generals had already"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"drawn up invasion plans. But hoping to avert war, B ritain and France, in tan- dem with Italy, negotiated with Hi t l e r for a compro mise. 8 2 After dramatic ups and downs, the last-minute Munic h Pact of Septem- ber 30, 1938, ceded the Sudetenland to Germany as o f the next day. The deal was called appeasement and was foisted upon Cz echoslovakia by the European powers without regard for the Czech nation . 83 On October 1, 1938, German forces moved in accordin g to a pre- arranged takeover schedule. Within hours of enterin g any town, it was trans- formed. Streets and buildings were bedecked with Na zi bunting and swastika flags. For months, highly organized Sudeten Nazis f unctioned as a vanguard for the oppression to come, burning Jewish homes an d boycotting Jewish stores. Now they ensured that Jewish shops were sme ared with white paint. 84 No one doubted what would come next. By October 2, thousands of Jews flooded across the new border by car, train, and on foot into what remained of Czechoslov akia. 85 Jews remaining behind found themselves identified, in spite of their highly assimilated Czech national character. Nazi c ontingents would system- atically appear on their streets, drag families fro m their homes, herd them into trucks, and either deliver them to concentrati on camps or dump them penniless on the border with remnant Czechoslovakia . Many women and children, already beaten and bloody, were forced to cross the frontier crawl- ing on their hands and knees, some on their bellies . Soon, their overwhelm- ing numbers—as many as 40,000 had either fled or be en expelled—were too much for the Czechs. Nor were the Czechs willin g to provoke the Ger- mans by seeming to create a refuge for deported Jew s. The Czechs refused them entry. 86 Ousted from the Sudetenland, and barred from the re duced Czechoslo- vakia, thousands of expelled Jews were now stranded in slender tracts of no- man's land between border crossings. Dispossessed o f everything, hundreds dwelled in roadside ditches, completely exposed to the elements without food, water, sanitation, or an understanding of how they had been identified or why they were suffering this fate. South of Brue nn, 150 huddled beneath hedges. Near Kostitz: 52 people. Outside Reigern: 5 1 people. Food ship- ments sent by relief committees were blocked by Cze ch guards, German sol- diers, or Party stalwarts. Then came rains to magni fy their misery and muddy their nightmare. 87 The agony of these ditch people became an on-going spectacle for the world's media. They survived from moment to moment only on the morsels of food thrown in pity by passersby transiting the borders and disregarding"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"prohibitions on aid. When the trapped Jews were fin ally forced back to the German side, vicious mobs of jeering Nazis brutaliz ed them. 88 But the Sudetenland was not enough for Hitler. In e arly 1939, the Third Reich pressured Czechoslovakia to commence it s own anti-Jewish ousters, including those Jews who had fled Germany, Austria, and the Sude- tenland. Czechoslovakia complied, hoping to foresta ll an invasion. At 6 A.M. on March 15, 1939, the Reich invaded anyway. German troops pushed into all of Moravia and Bohemia. Hitler declared the who le of Czechoslovakia a Reich Protectorate under the iron-handed rule of ap pointed Governors. Now all of Czech Jewry would be decimated. A staccato o f anti-Semitic registra- tions, expulsions, and confiscations soon descended upon all of what was once known as Czechoslovakia. 89 Within days, newspapers were reporting the same sor rowful fate for Czech Jewry as experienced elsewhere. Doctors and m erchants were ex- pelled from their posts and professional associati ons. Synagogues were burned. Signs forbidding Jews at cafes and other st ores appeared. 90 The suicides began. Thirty per day in Prague. In Ch icago, a number of Czech refugees who had been admitted on temporary v isas formed a \"sui- cide colony.\" One member of the colony was Mrs. Kar el Langer, who ended her family's life in the Congress Hotel. First she hurled her two young boys, six and four years of age, out of the window of the thirteenth floor. She leapt after them just seconds later. Police recovered all three bodies from the Michigan Avenue sidewalk. 91 Registration of property and family members was ext ended not only to those who outwardly practiced Judaism, but those de fined by the Nurem- berg Laws as having three and in some cases, two, J ewish grandparents. An estimated 200,000 would be involved. 92 IBM was already in Czechoslovakia. Shortly after Hi tler came to power, IBM NY had established a service bureau in Prague. The first school for Czech salesmen was opened in 1935 about the time th e Nuremberg Laws were passed. In November 1936, Watson approved a ca rd printing plant in a small town near Prague, where sixteen printers and two cutting machines were installed. Some months later, as IBM ramped up operations, the com- pany protested when Czech Customs changed the compa ny's tariff classifica- tion from simplistic mechanical punches to statisti cal machines. 93 In 1937, Georg Schneider was hired as an additional salesman for Prague. Within about a year, Schneider was transfer red to Dehomag in Berlin \"as a salesman and studying the German organization .\" He met Watson in Berlin, as well as the company's leading Swiss-base d supervisors. By that"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"time, Czechoslovakian State Railways was utilizing 52.2 million punch cards per year. In 1939, IBM Geneva and Dehomag agreed th at Schneider should return to Prague, where about sixty employees worke d, as the new co-man- ager working with Director Emil Kuzcek. At about th at time, the Reich opened the Statistical Office for the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, located in Prague. IBM did not list itself in Czech commercial registries as owning its own subsidiary. Instead, the subsidiary' s 200,000 Korunas value was held 102,000 by IBM's attorney in Prague, Stefa n Schmid, and 98,000 by IBM's European General Manager John Holt, both men acting as nominees for IBM NY. 94 For IBM, the question was not how deeply Dehomag wo uld control all Hollerith activity in Czechoslovakia, but once agai n, who would share in the profit. In the first days of 1939, after Germany's takeover of the Sudetenland, and at the height of the Reich's threats to take ov er the rest of Czechoslova- kia, IBM worried about the bonus question with Heid inger, Rottke, and Hummel. On January 11, 1939, Watson's personal emissary, Ha rrison Chauncey, drafted a letter for European Manager Holt in Genev a, reviewing how the oral arrangement with Dehomag for \"new territories\" might work once Czechoslovakia was included. So there was no mistak e, Chauncey recited the language from the oral arrangement. \"'In case the I BM should voluntarily transfer the working of territories outside of Germ any to the Dehomag,'\" Chauncey quoted, \"'we also agree that, upon the req uest of the IBM, we can be totally or partly excluded from the results of t he business transactions .. . as they have been agreed upon in the form of a bonu s in the loan agreements.'\" 95 Then Chauncey posited the question: \"In the case of Austria and Czechoslovakia, should determination be made whethe r or not at this time as to whether Rottke and Hummel should receive the benefits from any busi- ness within these two countries.\" 96 In an effort to create deniability about the decisi on, Chauncey added, \"under present circumstances it might be unwise for the IBM to make the determination.\" Written by hand, the sentence appen ded, \"but Dehomag should when time is proper.\" Thus, IBM NY could cla im that Czech activity was undertaken at Dehomag's sole decision—even thou gh no such activity could take place without Watson's permission. 97 Addressing the time constraints, Chauncey wrote, \"Y ou might consider whether Dehomag should have an understanding immedi ately, because, of course, there will also be involved a transfer of t he assets in Austria and"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Czechoslovakia.\" 98 Chauncey's letter did not refer to \"the Sudetenlan d,\" which had already been swept into t h e Reich, but \"C zechoslovakia\"; although Czechoslovakia was being daily threatened with forc ible annexation, Ger- many was still weeks away from its invasion. A senior IBM executive, John G. Phillips, scribbled on the draft, \"have Chauncey see me.\" On January 17, 1939, the heavily edited letter to Holt was formally typed on letterhead and again submitted to senior executives for review. Still maintaining deniability, the revised version suggested, \"Under present circumstances, we wonder whether it would b e unwise for IBM to make the determination relating to territory and pr oducts. We might con- sider whether it would be more proper to have Rottk e and Hummel write Dehomag setting forth substantially the same thing as in the letter to Mr. Gubelman. . .. You might consider whether Dehomag s hould have an under- standing immediately, because, of course, there wil l also be involved a trans- fer of the assets in Austria and Czechoslovakia.\" 99 But Chauncey's letter still seemed too sensitive fo r senior IBM execu- tives, Newspaper headlines and newsreels were blast ing Germany daily for the Czech situation. After ten days, the letter was still not approved, and finally on January 27, Chauncey was instructed by P hillips, \"suggest we hold on this for the present.\" 100 Dehomag lost no time in proceeding in Czechoslovaki a—with or with- out settling the question of bonuses for Czech acti vity. But even if Rottke and Hummel were willing to wait for a decision on b onuses, Heidinger was not. As Germany prepared to launch an invasion agai nst Czechoslovakia, Heidinger unleashed his own battle plan to secure a share in the profit the IBM organization expected in newly conquered territ ories. GERMANY WAS facing economic collapse and began clamping down on tax- payers and profiteers. Watson had refused to declar e a profit since 1934, despite record multi-million mark earnings. Tax aut horities reviewed RM 180,000 in IBM advances and loans to Heidinger in l ieu of actual profit divi- dends. Heidinger's money was declared a bonus no ma tter how it was disguised—and he was ordered to pay RM 90,000 in ta xes. On January 20, 1938, Heidinger wrote to IBM's Holt in Geneva compl aining that no matter what IBM called it, 'The German government consider s it as a dividend and I have to pay the [income] taxes.\" The levy was in ad dition to his normal income taxes. \"That is impossible for me,\" he conce ded. \"I would have to burden my properties with a mortgage or to change m y standard of life.\" 101 "},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Heidinger offered IBM an ultimatum: either declare a bona fide profit and pay a d i v i d e n d for prior years tha t would net h im RM 250,000—or he would exercise an o p t i o n requiring IBM to buy back his shares in the com- pany. For now, he was offering just one of his ten shares. He would still re- tain 9 percent. \"Find out which . . . Mr. Watson wo uld prefer,\" Heidinger asked. 102 Alarms went off in Geneva, Paris, and New York. IBM had no objection to a stock buy-back. But everyone understood that i f Heidinger reduced his holdings below 10 percent that might cause Nazi aut horities to re-examine the Aryan nature of Dehomag. The company could lose the ability to use \"Deutsche\" in its name, and might even be taken ove r by kommissars. 103 More- over, in Germany's current state of war preparednes s, punch card technology overseers in the Ministry of War could even decree a takeover. Letters flew across the Atlantic as IBM tried to pl an its next move. IBM's Geneva Controller J. C. Milner coolly informe d Rottke that the com- pany had no difficulty declaring a dividend, but Ge rman law limited such distributions to 6 or 8 percent—and that amount wou ld not be much more than monies already advanced. As for Heidinger sell ing back his stock, Mil- ner curtly wrote, \"we can take no decision on this. \" Rottke wrote back, encouraging New York to pay Heidinger. Stalling for time, Milner replied, \"it will not be possible to come to a final decision .. . until such time as I receive a reply from Head Office.\" 104 Rottke's reply was explicit: \"I would gather . . . the IBM does not wish to purchase this interest [Heidinger's stock] ... i nasmuch as a change of Ger- man interests into foreign hands would be a disadva ntage at the present time. However, something will have to be done, beca use Heidinger needs money and can or will obtain it by other means; nob ody will be able to legally prevent him from selling.\" 105 Throughout spring 1938, more letters, conferences, and debates streamed between IBM offices on both sides of the o cean. Watson personally called for written recommendations and proposed agr eements from special advisors, accountants, and attorneys both in and ou t of Germany. In some cases, one translation wasn't enough for Watson. Th e whole dispute was all coming at a difficult time in view of Dehomag's exp ansion plans. Austria had just been annexed, and Germany was openly plann ing the takeover of Czechoslovakia. Even as Watson was battling Heiding er's demand for bonuses, he was cautiously negotiating the nature a nd bonuses of Dehomag's expansion into \"new territories,\" such as Austria a nd Czechoslovakia. 106 Watson compromised—in a way. With his consent, Deho mag adopted a"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"shareholder resolution for \"an eventual dividend to be declared for the years 1935, 1936 and 1937.\" When it was, Heidinger would be paid his long awaited bonus, less all his advances, of course. In the meantime, Watson's many outside advisors would provide the written opi nions about how much profit was legally permissible to declare under exi sting German law without incurring confiscatory taxes and mandatory loans to the Reich. To assuage a nervous Heidinger, Watson agreed to provide yet mor e advances, RM 7,000 monthly for the remainder of 1938. 107 But Heidinger was impatient. While he had appealed the tax decision, he did not expect to prevail. Soon, Heidinger would have to pay a huge assessment. Dehomag's books reflected one multi-mil lion mark record after another—1938 alone would yield RM 2.39 million in c onceded profits even after IBM applied various intra-company devices. 108 Yet Watson still delayed any decision on declaring a profit. Finally, in late November 1938, just days after Kri stallnacht, a furious exchange of correspondence between New York and Ber lin escalated into a stubborn standoff over dividing the money. The squabbling culminated with Heidinger implying t hat Watson was involved in defrauding the Reich tax authorities. I n a long, rambling and sar- castic five-page letter to one of Watson's Berlin a ttorneys, Heidinger openly conceded his stock was a sham. Referring to his so- called \"preferred shares in Dehomag,\" Heidinger declared, \"My company shares are no real preferred shares, if for instance the Tabulating Division wou ld yield no net profit, while the remaining divisions would earn a net profit of say five percent, on my shares, I would not obtain anything and the remaini ng five percent are there- fore not preferred in that case but disadvantaged.\" 109 Heidinger's letter repeatedly insisted the bogus sh are arrangement might be viewed by the authorities as a scheme \"fla tly to evade paragraph 3 of the law.\" He invoked strong words, uncharacteris tic of IBM's usual ambi- guity. At one point, he referred to \"a tax liabilit y evaded by abnormal mea- sures.\" The word \"evade\" was used repeatedly, as in \"tax evasion.\" Heidinger even added an unsubtle hint of criminality, writing , \"But by no means must we expose the Dehomag to the risk of a penal prosec ution.\" As was his style, he flamboyandy concluded his pejorative missive \"wi th renewed hearty thanks.\" 110 Watson sought help from Price Waterhouse. But the p restigious accoun- tancy firm could only conclude Dehomag's finances w ere in supremely profitable condition and that Heidinger deserved hi s bonus. In its lengthy thirteen-page single-spaced analysis, dated Decembe r 30, 1938, Price Water-"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"house declared: the only question is when and how m uch to pay Heidinger. Moreover, warned Price Waterhouse, if Heidinger i nsisted on selling his shares, the value of that stock—real or not—was far greater than when the original merger took place in 1934. Using rigid pri nciples of valuation, Price Waterhouse examined the pluses and minuses of the G erman political and tax environment, and the problem of blocked bank ac counts. The firm con- eluded that each share of Dehomag was actually \"wor th more to a purchaser in Germany, than to a resident abroad.\" The report underlined the words \"in Germany.\" 111 For Watson, this meant that his shares were now ac tually less valuable than Heidinger's. Indeed, Price Waterhouse asserted, Dehomag by any m easure had only become more valuable. The net worth of the company had essentially dou- bled from its RM 7.7 million total investment in 19 34 to more than RM 14 million. Annual earnings were about RM 2.3 million, a 16 percent return on net assets. 112 At the same time, more bad news came. Dehomag was s upplying machinery and spare parts to IBM for resale through out Europe. IBM in turn merely credited Dehomag's loan balance account. Fru strated and defiant, Dehomag managers in mid-December 1938 unilaterally began terming those shipments \"exports.\" This triggered the Reich's rul e requiring actual foreign currency payment, which Dehomag obtained by debitin g IBM's precious few dollar accounts in Germany. 113 On January 3, 1939, IBM's Geneva Controller J. C. M ilner mailed Wat- son a long, detailed letter explicating the adverse Price Waterhouse report, searching for silver linings, parsing Heidinger's c ontract language, and ulti- mately trying to construct loopholes around the ine vitability of either paying Heidinger dividends or buying part of his stock. Mi lner conceded that buy- ing just one of Heidinger's shares would expose the subsidiary as American- controlled. 114 Milner explored all the possibilities. \"If he [Heid inger] died and the stock was offered to IBM, in accordance with his co ntract, the higher book value combined with the earnings of the company wou ld probably force a high valuation of the stock,\" asserted Milner. Mayb e the company could pay the elderly Heidinger in ten annual installments? C ould Dehomag purchase Heidinger's stock with blocked marks as an internal obligation? Milner offered a range of options, none of them promising. 115 It seemed to be a no-win dilemma for IBM. Purchase of Heidinger's stock was out of the question, asserted Milner, bec ause no one could predict"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"what the Reich economic and taxing authorities woul d do. On the other hand, once dividends on the 1935— 1937 period were formally paid to Hei- dinger, he would next ask for dividends for 1938. I t would continue annu- ally even as the company's value escalated. 116 Clearly, money was a pressure tactic IBM could use. Heidinger was receiving a monthly allowance of RM 7,000 for all o f 1938. Milner had some weeks earlier reminded IBM attorneys in New York, \" the last payment on this account will fall due in December. It will the n be necessary for a deci- sion to be made regarding the year 1939.\" 117 Heidinger was being squeezed. Not only was he liabl e for a RM 90,000 tax, but because of the protracted reporting delay, German tax authorities had added a mandatory loan to the government, made retroactive for the three wars 1934-1937, and that loan totaled RM 151, 000. He could never afford that without help from the company. Watson u nderstood that, and cut off Heidinger's RM 7,000 monthly advance. 118 In a March 13 letter, Rottke implored Milner to adv ance Heidinger the money needed for the mandatory loan. 119 Heidinger was clearly desperate. Tax monies would be due within a matter of weeks. H e had accommodated Watson all these years. Now he needed help. Watson was unmoved. On March 15, the day the Nazis smashed into the remainder of Czechoslovakia, Milner calmly answ ered Rottke, expressing regret for a \"very awkward condition.\" But in fact, insisted Milner, it was Hei- dinger who had insisted that dividends be paid. If now the taxing authority had imposed mandatory loans, that was Heidinger's p roblem. Indeed, IBM attorneys in Berlin had carefully studied current r egulations and determined that IBM had actually advanced monies above the leg al limit. 'Therefore,\" asserted Milner, \"it is Mr. Heidinger who has recei ved too much money, and it is he who should make arrangements to invest the su rplus with the Loan Stock Bank.\" 120 In describing the mess to the IBM NY officers, Miln er caustically noted, \"We cannot be blamed if Mr. Heidinger's own governm ent will not let him draw adequate cash dividends. On the other hand, th is increases the hazard of his offering to sell us some of his stock.\" 121 In the meantime, IBM was negotiating with the subsi diary's two other managers, Hummel and Rottke, over the profit sharin g plan for Dehomag's activities outside of Germany. On March 21, six day s after Czechoslovakia had been seized, even as Poland, Lithuania, and oth er countries were being actively threatened with German invasion, IBM Europ ean troubleshooter"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Harrison Chancey dashed a short note off to Phillip s about the bonus terms for \"new territories\" to be handed to Dehomag. \"I w onder,\" Chauncey asked, \"if the further changes in the German political sit uation require any consider- ation of this subject at this time?\" Phillips in Ne w York scrawled a note back, \"Considering present changes in the map of Europe d on't you consider it best to wait?\" 122 It was no longer just Austria and Czechoslovakia. C learly, other nations would soon come under Dehomag's sphere of influence . IBM was trying to plan ahead. BRINKSMANSHIP WAS Watson's specialty. First he instructed Holt not to go to Berlin to participate in a scheduled shareholder s meeting. Hence, no deci- sion could be voted on Heidinger's request. As each day passed, Heidinger's financial situation worsened. 123 Then, on March 31, 1939, Watson cabled Holt: \"Loan Heidinger 150,000 marks to pay Loan Stock Account and also au thorize you to vote for payment of 8% dividend, you to invest our dividend money in real estate.\" Under German law, 8 percent was the legal limit IBM could pay without incurring additional taxation. The 8 percent divide nd was to be paid monthly just as the advance was. But 8 percent woul d total RM 3,500, just half of what Heidinger needed to pay his bills and half the 16 percent return identified by Price Waterhouse. 124 Heidinger needed RM 7,000 per month. He was fed up with IBM and Watson. A PRIL 26, 1939 Thomas J. Watson President of the IBM New York Dear Mr. Watson!

Again expressing my deepest regret, I beg to accept my personal regards and remain very sincerely yours, Willy Heidinger 125 Rottke openly conceded the contract between IBM and Heidinger had \"been made under an unlucky star, [and] appears to be the source of all evil.\" But he nonetheless warned Watson again that if Heidinger's shares were transferred to a foreign source Dehomag would probably not be per- mitted \"the use of the word Deutsche (German) as an enterprise recognized in Germany as German.\" 126 That disaster had to be avoided at all costs. To IBM's doctrinaire German managers, including Heidin ger, Dehomag repre- sented far more than just a profit-making enterpris e. To them, Dehomag had the technologic ability to keep Germany's war machi ne automated, facilitate her highly efficient seizure of neighboring countri es, and achieve the Reich's swiftly moving racial agenda. If IBM's subsidiary w ere deemed non-Aryan, the company would be barred from all the sensitive projects awaiting it.

The stakes were too high for the Nazis. The stakes were too high for capitalism. But it was the Germans who gave in, deferring on Heidinger's demands for a few months under term Watson dictated. \"Watson now controlled something t he Third Reich needed to launch the next decisive step in the solution of the Jewish question, not just in Germany—but all of Europe.

They missed virtually no one in the Greater Reich's 22 million households, 3.5 million farmhous es, 5.5 mi l l i o n shops and factories. Teams of five to e ight census takers fanned out through the big cities such as Berlin, F rankfurt, Ham- burg, and Vienna. Towns and villages were divided i nto districts of thirty homes with one census taker assigned to each . Some 80 mil- lion citizens in the Greater Reich, including Germa ny, Austria, the Sudentenland, and the Saar, would be classed accord ing to their ancestry. 1 There was little question to the world that the May 1939 na- tional census was racial in nature. New York Times coverage of the mammoth project made clear that this census would \" provide de- tailed information on the ancestry, religious faith and material pos- sessions of all residents. Special blanks will be p rovided on which each person must state whether he is of pure 'Aryan ' blood. The status of each of his grandparents must be given an d substantiated by evidence in case of inquiry.\" 2 Certainly, by May 1939, virtually every \"practicing Jew\" had been registered, surveyed, numbered, and sorted num erous times in a series of overlapping, often disjointed, campa igns. The purpose of the 1939 census was to identify the so-called \"r acial Jews\" in"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Germany proper, add Jews of any definition in the n ew territories of the expanded Reich, and locate each individual before b eing ghettoized or sub- jected to other action. Indeed the ghettoization de crees had begun that very month. In addition, Germany was preparing for all-o ut war and without the census, it could not identify exactly where all its draftable men were, which women would step into their economic shoes on ce mobilized. 3 As such, the census was vital to Hitler's two-front wa r—one against the Jews, and one against all of Europe. Understandably, Dehomag's 1939 undertaking dwarfed anything it had attempted before, including the 1933 Prussian censu s. Months of intensive training, conducted in thousands of sessions, prepa red legions of volunteers for the critical mission. Police and their auxiliar ies were mandated to support the count \"with all their powers\" and \"to function as census-takers in difficult and confusing residential areas,\" according to offi cial regulations. 4 The additional Hollerith machinery assembled was ma ssive: 400 elec- trical key punches, 10 gang punches, 20 summary pun ches, 300 key punch verifiers, 70 sorters, 50 tabulators, 25 duplicator s, and 50 D-11 VZ tabula- tors. The Reich had imposed seemingly impossible ta rget delivery dates for November 1939. So to increase speed, Dehomag's engi neers converted their versatile D-11 calculating tabulator into a pure co unting machine dubbed the D-11 VZ. The improvised device could process 12 ,000 60-column punched cards per hour in sixteen counters and then precision-punch its own summaries onto 80-column cards. Eighty million card s were actually used. 5 A special envelope containing a so-called Supplemen tal Card was cre- ated. This all-important card recorded the individu al's bloodline data and functioned as the racial linchpin of the operation. Each head of household was to fill out his name and address and then docum ent his family's ancestral lines. Jews understandably feared the newest identi fication. Census takers were cautioned to overcome any distrust by assuring families that the infor- mation would not be released to the financial autho rities. 6 But it was not German taxing agencies that were the most eager for the new data. It was the Nazi Party structure and Reich security forces seeking to locate additional Jews and other undesirables. Inde ed, the final data was intended to help comprise a single national registe r for the entire Greater Reich. Each card carried a single column coded for descent, designed into the card prototype long before the census was launc hed. A letter from the Order Police to the Ministry of the Interior at the end of 1938 explained: \"This column on the registration card is included t o be filled out at the right"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"time. That time should come in May of next year dur ing the population, occupation, and company census. The regular questio nnaire will be supple- mented by an additional card. This card will includ e the question of whether the person had any fully Jewish grandparent. Survey results will then be evaluated using this registration card.\" 7 The 25 million Supplemental Cards—one for each hous ehold—repre- sented a virtual doubling of census files. To cope with the volume and still meet deadlines, the census tabulation was divided i nto two operations. First, each special envelope containing a Supplemental Car d was labeled to corre- spond to the household's general questionnaire, alo ng with the district and municipality of origin. Then local officials, gener ally the police, affixed the letter \"J\" to both the questionnaires and cards of all Jewish families. 8 The words \"Do Not Send Directly to the [Berlin] Sta tistical Bureau\" were printed on every envelope. Instead, both the g eneral questionnaire and its companion special envelope were sent to the reg ional statistical offices for the tedious quality control procedures. Did the env elopes match up to the questionnaires? Were Supplemental Cards containing racial data and the general questionnaires filled out completely? Just preparing the 25 million census forms and 25 million Supplemental Cards for processing required a behemoth manual operation. Once approved, the quest ionnaires and cards were transported to Berlin and separated. The Suppl emental Cards were sorted into three groups: non-Aryans, \"higher educa ted people,\" and all oth- ers. These were then tabulated to yield the racial data. 9 Never before had so many been counted so thoroughly and quickly. The Reich Statistical Office hired an additional 2, 000 staffers to process the forms and race cards, which were enough to fill mor e than seventy boxcars. As in 1933, Dehomag created cavernous counting room s and management offices at the Statistical Office headquarters in B erlin to tabulate the informa- tion. Initially, Dehomag's army of operators punche d 450,000 cards per day. With time, the volume reached one million daily. Th e company met its dead- line. Preliminary analyzed results were ready by No vember 10, 1939, the one-year anniversary of Kristallnacht, and, more im portandy for Hitler, the anniversary of Germany's surrender in the Great War . 10 Intense demand to access the final information on r acial Jews came from competing Nazi organizations as well as state and national government bureaus. But anxious local and state agencies would have to wait. For exam- ple, municipal officials throughout Saxony asked th eir regional statistical offices if they could examine the census data first to speed their ghettoization"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"and confiscation campaings. But the Reich Statistic al Office in Berlin said no. Greater priority was granted to the SD and Adolf Ei chmann's Referat II 112, which both received copies of a l l census registrati on lists. 11 The census yielded exactly the data Nazi Germany ne eded, including data for the areas beyond Germany. Within months, f or example, bureaucrats in the Austrian Statistical Office had compiled a c omplete profile of Jewish existence in the country. A report dispatched to Re ich officials opened with the explanation: \"In the census of May 17, 1939, th e question was put for the first time whether one of the individual's grandpar ents was a full Jew by race.\" With stunning specificity, the extensive sum mary concluded, \"Accord- ing to the initial results of this year's census, t here were 91,480 full Jews and 22,344 part Jews of Grades I and II in Vienna as of May 17, 1939. In the remaining Reich Districts of the Ostmark there were 3,073 full Jews and 4,241 part Jews.\" Tables displayed the Jewish total s divided into full Jews, as well as Grade I and Grade II Jews. Each of those de signations was sub- divided between male and female and then delineated district by district for all of Vienna. In Innere Stadt: 116 Grade II female Jews. In Aimmering: 27 Grade II males. In Wieden: 31 Grade I males. Precis e numbers were tallied for key regions as well: Salzburg, Tirol, and other s. 12 Dehomag's final calculations yielded a grand total of 330,539 so-called \"racial Jews\" still dwelling within the expanded Re ich—Germany, Austria and the Sudetenland. This was far less than the wil d projections of 1.5 mil- lion generated four years earlier when the Nurember g Laws were drafted. The new count showed 138,819 males and 191,720 fema les—more females because about 35,000 Jewish wives had become widowe d or detached from refugee men. Clearly, through persecution, emigrati on, death during incar- ceration, and outright execution, Greater Germany h ad lost about half its originally counted Jewish population of some 502,00 0, including Jews added when the Saar region was annexed in 1935. But , by adding Austria and the Sudetenland, the Third Reich discovered tha t by 1939 it had actually gained an additional 96,893 Jews. 13 Moreover, there were hundreds of thousands more Jew s in the old Czechoslovakia, now called the Protectorate of Bohe mia and Moravia. Mil- lions more existed in Poland and other countries in Europe that Germany planned to conquer or dominate. Indeed, the same Ge rman refugees would be encountered again and again as they fled from na tion to nation. Emigration and deportation would not work. Jewish r efugees were being, or would be, reabsorbed as Germany annexed o r invaded new territo- ries in Europe. Dehomag's numbers told them exactly how many Jews could"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"be found in the Greater Reich, and soon I B M subsidi aries throughout Europe would help compile the numbers for invaded territor ies as well. It seemed the more the Reich achieved its territorial goals, the more Jews it encountered. A better solution would be needed. BY 1939, Nazi race policy had evolved. No longer wa s Germany's anti- Semitic crusade content with just ridding the Great er Reich of Jews. Hitler had always wanted all Europe completely Jew-free. I n pursuit of that goal, NSDAP forces had spent years subversively cultivati ng paramilitary Fascist surrogates worldwide—from Brazil's Integralite Part y to Syria's Phalange militia. Europe, of course, was the Nazi success st ory. Romania's Iron Guard was highly organized and impatient. In Holland, it was the Dutch Nazi Party. Polish Brown Shirts terrorized Jews. In Hungary, th e Arrow Cross Party agi- tated. In Croatia, blood-lusting Ustashi could not wait. Whether their shirts were black, brown, or silver, whether of German ext raction or merely anti- Semites in other lands, these people could be relie d upon to preach Hitler's ideology of Jew-hatred, racial castes, and Aryan su periority. 14 Wherever those of German ancestry or ultra-national ists existed, the Reich sought to use them as advance troops organize d around strict Aryan principles. The Auslandsorganisation of the NSDAP, an association of German Nazis living abroad, was the backbone of this movem ent. Berlin expected members to help achieve its goals. Typical was a pu blished exhortation in the German press demanding all Aryans to observe rigid racial purity. In that same vein, Goering had demanded quite publicly in h is speeches that Ger- mans living in other countries terminate all Jewish employees and \"be the servants of this Homeland.\" 15 But keeping track of potential German sympathizers globally was a prodigious task. As early as summer 1938, the Germa n Foreign Institute at Stuttgart began compiling what it called a \"Germ an world migration regis- ter\" to help identify its friends in other countrie s. Advocates insisted \"[t]he World Migration Book must represent more than a car d index but a Ger- man world . . . [where] eternal Germanism may live. \" The Stuttgart Kurier asserted that the Migration Book would remind Germa ns worldwide of their \"never ending task to work with word and deed for t he maintenance of the German race.\" 16 Even as it rallied Nazi cohorts throughout Europe, Berlin pressured its neighbors to adopt anti-Semitic policies along Arya n lines to forestall Ger- man aggression. For example, just days before the R eich invaded Czechoslo-"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"vakia, Berlin offered to respect Prague's borders o nly if it submitted to a three-prong ultimatum: delivery of one third of its gold reserves, dismantling of its army, and an immediate solution of the Jewis h problem\" according to Nuremberg racial definitions. 17 Country after country adopted laws identical to Ger man race policies, ousting Jews, confiscating their assets, and organi zing their expulsion long before the Reich crossed their borders. By spring 1 939, Hungary had already passed a series of anti-Jewish measures, including land expropriation, profes- sional exclusion, and citizenship annulment. A New York Times headline on the question declared, \"Aim to Head Off Nazis.\" Wav es of pogroms and Nazi- style anti-Jewish boycotts and economic expulsions had long been sweeping Poland, especially in areas with many so-called Vol ksdeutsche, those of Ger- man parentage. By 1937, a leading party in the Poli sh government, \"the Camp of National Unity,\" declared the popular campaign h ad become official, to the delight of German-allied Polish Fascists. Simil ar persecution was regu- larly debated in Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Lithu ania. Eventually the majority of Europe would soon legislate Jews out of existence. It was all part of Berlin's new continent-wide irresistible sphere of anti-Semitic influence. 18 While Berlin was igniting anti-Jewish campaigns eve rywhere, NSDAP forces were quietly gathering population details on Jews throughout the Continent and preparing for the day when Nazi-inspi red coups or outright invasion would permit the instant liquidation of on e Jewish community after another. Nazi race and population scientists utiliz ing punch card systems were a crucial component of this effort. Typical was a Nazi operative named Carl Fust, who w as scouting church records for familial information in Lithuania as fa r back as 1936. On June 29, 1936, he reported his progress to the Reichssippena mt in Berlin. \"I have now also registered all known books of the Tilsit Menno nite Community,\" wrote Fust. \"It was quite a task to find the present loca tion of the books . . . The entries ... go partly back to the year 1769; howeve r, individual data goes back as far as 1722.\" 19 The Reichssippenamt automated its files with Holle rith machines. On July 2, 1936, several Nazis met in a Breslau inn to discuss the serv- ices of Fritz Arlt, a Leipzig statistician. Arlt ha d created a cross-referenced card file on every Leipzig Jewish resident, down to so-called quarter-Jews. What made Arlt's expertise desirable was that his c ards also listed exactly which ancestral Polish towns their families origina ted from. At the Breslau meeting, Arlt was assigned to work with the securit y offices of the Ansland- sorganisation. His groundbreaking Polish demography was deemed so piv-"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"otal, Arlt was asked to journey to Berlin to assist Eichmann's Referat II 112, with travel expenses to be paid by t h e SD. 2 0 The Reich did everything in its power to extend its census, registration, and genealogical reach throughout Europe. Once it i nvaded or forced its political domination in a neighboring country, it c ould then immediately locate both racial and practicing Jews. Berlin prov ed it could be done in Aus- tria and the Sudetenland. But such demographic feat s Europe-wide would be impossible without detailed, automated informati on about Jewish citizens in other lands. That required more than the resourc es of the Reich Statistical Office, it required multi-national statistical coop eration. IBM subsidiaries throughout Europe had long been wo rking in unison to take advantage of political and military events in Europe. Salesmen con- stantly shutded from various countries to either Ne w York or Berlin for train- ing, and were then transferred back to their origin al countries to oversee punch card operations. In late 1939, with Thomas Wa tson's consent, an inter- national training school for IBM service engineers throughout Europe was opened in Berlin. IBM lectures and demonstrations f or military leaders and government leaders were frequent—all under the watc hful eye of IBM's Geneva office. 21 In the first three months of 1939 alone, IBM Sweden sold 1.9 million punch cards to Denmark, 1.3 million to Finland, and 696,000 to Norway. IBM NY sold 1 million cards to Yugoslavia, and 700, 000 to Spain. Dehomag sold 261,000 to Hungary. 22 On February 16, 1939, Reich legal authorities annou nced that the term Aryan would be replaced in many instances by a new term: European racial. Under the new guidelines, other ethnic groups and r aces, such as Germany's Romanian and Hungarian allies, could be allowed to exist. 23 But a Jewish presence would be allowed nowhere on the Continent. By late spring 1939, Europe was wracked by incremen tal Nazi land grabs and invasions in Austria, Czechoslovakia, and the Memel region of Lithuania. Massive German military buildups, includ ing troop concentrations on its extended frontiers, threatened Denmark, Pola nd, Hungary, Luxem- bourg, Belgium, Holland, France, and England. Europ ean Jewry, including thousands of refugees, was threatened with extincti on. Regardless, Watson went full speed ahead with plans for the 1939 International Chamber of Commerce Congress. Origina lly scheduled for Tokyo, Watson had relocated the conference to Copen hagen after a troubled Japan withdrew. In Copenhagen, Watson planned to ma ke his most stren- uous appeal yet for raw materials to be handed over to Germany. As usual,"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Watson sought p o l i t i c a l cover for his a c t i v i t i e s . H e wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt on June 9, 1939, for the usua l open letter of support. This time, Watson was more careful. \"We should li ke very much to have a message from you to be read at our opening session on June 26 . . . [as] in our last Congress in Berlin in 1937, and if it's still consi stent with your policy.\" 24 The world had changed dramatically since 1937. Germ any was a promi- nent participant of the Watson-dominated ICC Congre ss. Diplomatic rela- tions with the Reich had been sorely strained since Kristallnacht and the various invasions. War was around the corner. Washi ngton did not want to act as though it was business as usual for Nazi Ger many in international par- leys. Unsure White House staffers shunted the lette r to Secretary of State Cordell Hull, asking him to prepare Roosevelt's com ment \"if you approve the sending of such a message.\" 25 In Copenhagen, at the ICC Congress, Watson's pro-Ax is proposal exceeded anything the State Department could have e xpected. He champi- oned a resolution whereby private businessmen from the three Axis and three Allied nations would actually supercede their governments and negoti- ate a radical new international trade policy design ed to satisfy Axis demands for raw materials coveted from other nations. The b usinessmen would then lobby their respective governments' official econom ic advisors to adopt their appeasement proposals for the sake of averting war. Ironically, the raw mate- rials were needed by Axis powers solely for the sak e of waging war. 26 On June 28, under Watson's leadership, the ICC pass ed a resolution again calling for \"a fair distribution of raw mater ials, food stuffs and other products . . . [to] render unnecessary the movement s of armies across fron- tiers.\" To this end, the ICC asked \"the governments of France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States . . . each collaborate with their own leading businessmen . , . with respect to national needs . . . [and therefore] give all countries of the world a fair o pportunity to share in the resources of the world.\" 27 Even as Watson angled for Germany to be ceded more raw materials, Germany was openly raping invaded territories. Just days before, on June 2, the New York Times carried a prominent story headli ned \"Terrors of Nazis Related by Benes,\" based on an international radio broadcast pleading for anti-Nazi resistance. In the article, purged Czecho slovakian President Eduard Benes detailed the Reich's methodical theft of Czec h resources since the March 15, 1939, invasion. \"Dr. Benes told of a nati on of 10 million persons,\" the New York Times related, \"until a few months ago proud and free, being systematically enslaved, degraded and robbed of its material and cultural"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":" possessions. The article indicated that Germany \"h as robbed and transported to Germany more than 35 billion crowns ... [$1.22 b illion] of Czecho-Slovak property.\" 28 Benes declared, \"You all must have heard how the Ge rman dictatorship is devastating the beauty that was Czecho-Slovakia, how splendid forests are being destroyed and the lumber carted away to Germa ny, how public build- ings... are being divested of their window frames, of their glass windows, of all materials ... all supplies have been taken and transported to Germany.... Factories are being ruined and industry crippled as machinery is carried away for war purposes.\" 29 He added, \"Czech families spend nights in the woods , not daring to sleep in their own beds for fear of Nazi pogroms. A nd German peasants, excited by the Nazis who have come from Germany for that purpose, bran- dish scythes and cry, 'The bloody night is coming.' \" 30 No wonder the German delegate to the ICC enthusiast ically lauded Watson's proposal, which only sought to legitimize by private consultation what the Third Reich was undertaking by force. In h is final speech of the Congress, Watson himself summed up the misery and d evastation in the world as a mere \"difference of opinion.\" His soluti on of businessmen confer- ring to divvy up other nations' resources to avoid further aggression was offered with these words: \"We regret that there are unsatisfactory economic and political conditions in the world today, with a great difference of opinion existing among many countries. But differences of o pinion, freely discussed and fairly disposed of, result in mutual benefit an d increased happiness to all concerned.\" 31 But so enthusiastic was Watson that he quickly wrot e to President Roosevelt, attaching transcripts from the conferenc e and explaining that the concept of a private survey by businessmen to resol ve and rewrite trade bar- riers was his invention. \"You will note that this r esolution does not suggest a political conference,\" Watson pointed out to the Pr esident, stressing the non- governmental procedure. But, he added, once the pri vate recommendations were tendered, the six nations might then call for an international meeting to ratify the suggestions. Watson concluded his letter indicating that he had a \"great deal of background\" on the topic \"which I pr efer to present to you in person.\" He added a tantalizing triviality: \"I also have a very interesting per- sonal message to deliver to you from [the Danish mo narch] His Majesty, King Christian X.\" 32 Watson's embarrassing correspondence asking to brie f Roosevelt began bouncing around the State Department, Division of E uropean Affairs, Advi-"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"sor on Political Relations, Division of Trade Agree ments, Department of Pro- tocol, Division of International Conferences, Offic e of the Advisor on Inter- national Economic Affairs, and Cordell Hull persona lly. One protocol chief wrote, \"it is not a matter for us . .. Mr. Watson b eing an American, we would have nothing to do with making an appointment for h im to see the Presi- dent.\" Another offered a hairsplitting technicality : Watson was the outgoing president of the ICC. His July 5 letter to Roosevel t was written a few days after being succeeded at the ICC. Therefore, \"It do es not appear that it is necessary to comment. . . inasmuch as Mr. Watson is no longer President of the International Chamber and the resolution does n ot come to us officially from that body.\" 33 Finally, an innocuous three-sentence say-nothing re ply was cobbled together for the President's review after being ini tialed by no fewer than ten Department officials. It read: \"My Dear Mr. Watson: I have received and read with interest your letter of July 5, 1939, in regar d to the meeting of the Tenth Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce. I note that you desire to discuss some of the background of this meeting w ith me in person and to deliver to me a personal message from His Majesty K ing Christian X. I shall look forward to seeing you after you return to this country.\" 34 In explaining so unresponsive a reply to Watson's e laborate letter, a key State Department official, John Hickerson, caustica lly wrote, \"It seems to me that the attached draft letter for the President to Mr. Watson says about as much as the President could appropriately say. I do not see how the Presi- dent could well comment on the resolution discussed in this letter recom- mending that the Governments of France, Germany, It aly, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States appoint economic repr esentatives of their re- spective governments to work with businessmen in re gard to 'their own needs and what they are able to contribute to the n eeds of other countries.'\" 35 Watson sent Hull a letter almost identical to the o ne he sent to Roose- velt. The same State Department group that formulat ed Roosevelt's response proffered a similar reply for the Secretary of Stat e, amounting to little more than a simple and non-committal thanks to Watson fo r \"your letter regarding the activities of the Congress.\" 36 But Watson would not desist. He sent formal lithogr aphed resolutions to the State Department hoping to rally its support for an international con- ference of business executives to parcel out the wo rld's resources. One State Department assistant secretary could not help but c omment on the similarity of Watson's suggestion to the Axis' own warlike dem ands. \"This is, of course, a political question of major world importance,\" wr ote the assistant secretary,"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"and one upon which we have been hearing much from G ermany, Italy and Japan. It occurs to me that it is most unfortunate that Mr. Thomas J. Watson, as an American serving as the president of the Inte rnational Chamber of Commerce, should have sponsored a resolution of thi s character. It may well be that his resolution will return to plague us at some future date.\" That comment was written on October 5, 1939. 37 By then it was unnecessary to reply further. Poland had already been invaded. World War II had b egun. HOURS BEFORE dawn on September 1, 1939, SS Officer Alfred Naujoc ks was preparing to launch World War II. For days, Nau jocks' detachment of German soldiers had been waiting. Sometime before 5 :40 A . M ., he received the code word from Berlin. Working methodically and according to plan, Naujocks' men donned Polish uniforms and staged a f ake attack against a German radio station. Drugged concentration camp in mates were dragged into position and smeared with blood to become the \"German casualties.\" This sham provided Hitler with the pretext to launc h Operation Case White - the invasion of Poland. 38 Germany's assault was the fiercest and fastest in h istory. Hundreds of airplanes mounted a sustained bombardment of Poland 's railroads, storage facilities, troop encampments, and cities. Six divi sions of coordinated troops, tanks, and artillery ravished Warsaw. Within days, the New York Times and other newspapers reported that three-fourths of muc h of the firebombed and shell-battered capital was reduced to smoking r ubble. So unique was this attack, it was dubbed Blitzkrieg, or lightning war. Britain and France declared war just days later. 39 Poland, essentially unarmored and in many cases dep loying horse cav- alry, held out for twenty-seven fierce days before its complete capitulation. News of barbarous massacres, rapes, inflicted starv ation, systematic deporta- tions, and the resulting unchecked epidemics made h eadlines around the world. In one incident in Nasielek, some 1,600 Jews were whipped all night in what was termed a \"whipping orgy.\" Two Jewish siste rs were dragged from their beds in the night and taken to a cemetery; on e was raped and the other given five zlotys and told to wait until next time. Shortly after the war began, a New York Times article headlined \"250,000 Jews li sted As Dead in Poland.\" 40 Polish Jewry numbered more than 3 million persons—1 0 percent of the Polish population. Atrocities, rapes, and massacres could not wipe them all away. Deportation to labor camps was underway. But something more drastic"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"was needed. A German military review of specific ac tions in Poland declared, \"It is a mistake to massacre some 10,000 Jews and P oles, as is being done at present . . . this will not eradicate t h e idea of a Polish state, nor will the Jews be exterminated.\" 41 On September 13, the New York Times reported the Re ich's dilemma with a headline declaring, \"Nazis Hint Purge of Jew s in Poland,\" with a sub- head, \"3,000,000 Population Involved.\" The article quoted the German gov- ernment as declaring it wanted \"removal of the Poli sh Jewish population from the European domain.\" The New York Times then added, \"How . . . the 'removal' of Jews from Poland [can be achieved] wit hout their extermination ... is not explained.\" 42 S EPTEMBER 9, 1939 Mr. Thomas J. Watson, President International Business Machines Corporation 590 Madison Ave. New York NY USA Dear Mr. Watson: During your last visit in Berlin at the beginning o f July, you made the kind offer to me that you might be willing to f urnish the German company machines from Endicott in order to shorten our long delivery terms. I... asked you to leave with us for study pu rposes one alphabetic tabulating machine and a collator out of the American machines at present in Germany. You have complied w ith this request, for which I thank you very much, and have added tha t in cases of urgent need, I may make use of other American machi nes.... You will understand that under today's conditions, a certain need has arisen for such machines, which we do not build as yet in Germany. Therefore, I should like to make use of your kind o ffer and ask you to leave with the German company for the time being th e alphabetic tab- ulating machines which are at present still in the former Austria.... Regarding the payment, I cannot make any concrete p roposals at the moment, however, I should ask you to be convinced t hat I shall see to it that a fair reimbursement for the machines left with us will be made when there will be a possibility. ... ... [A]t the time that the German production of the se machines ren- ders it possible, we shall place at your disposal.. . a German machine for each American machine left with us."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"This offer, made orally by you, dear Mr. Watson ... will undoubtedly be greatly appreciated in many and especially respo nsible circles.... We should thank you if you would ask your Geneva or ganization, at the same time, to furnish us the necessary repair p arts for the mainte- nance of the machines.... Yours very truly, H. Rottke cc: Mr. F. W. Nichol, New York cc: IBM Geneva 43 IBM's alphabetizer, principally its model 405, was introduced in 1934, but it did not become widely used until it was perf ected in conjunction with the Social Security Administration. The elaborate a lphabetizer was the pride of IBM. Sleek and more encased than earlier Holleri ths, the complex 405 integrated several punch card mechanisms into a sin gle, high-speed device. A summary punch cable connector at its bottom facilit ated the summarizing of voluminous tabulated results onto a single summary card. A short card feed and adjacent stacker at the machine's top was attac hed to a typewriter-style printing unit equipped with an automatic carriage t o print out the alphabet- ized results. Numerous switches, dials, reset keys, a control panel, and even an attached reading table, made the 405 a very expe nsive and versatile device. By 1939, the squat 405 was IBM's dominant m achine in the United States. However, the complex statistical instrument was simply too expensive for the European market. Indeed, in 1935, the compa ny was still exhibiting it at business shows. 44 Because the 405 required so many raw materials, in clud- ing rationed metals that Dehomag could not obtain, IBM's alphabetizer was simply out of reach for the Nazi Reich. But the 405 was of prime importance to Germany for its critical ability to create alphabetized lists and its speed for gene ral tabulation. The 405 could calculate 1.2 million implicit multiplication s in just 42 hours. By com- parison, the slightly older model 601 would need 80 0 hours for the same task —fundamentally an impossible assignment. 45 More than 1,000 405s were operating in American gov ernment bureaus and corporate offices, constituting one of the comp any's most profitable inventions. But few of the expensive devices were a nywhere in Europe. Previ- ously, Dehomag was only able to provide such machin es to key governmental agencies direcdy from America or through its other European subsidiaries—a costly financial foreign exchange transaction, whic h also required the specific permission of Watson. Germany had taken over Poland and war had been"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"declared in Europe. Such imports from America were no longer possible. But Dehomag wanted the precious alphabetizing equipment still in Austria: five variously configured alphabetical punches, two alph abetical interpreters, and six alphabetical printing tabulators, as well as on e collator. However, these valuable assets were still owned and controlled by the prior IBM subsidiary. 46 Watson would not transfer the assets or give the Au strian machines to Dehomag without something in return. The exchanges began by a return to the issue of Heidinger's demand to sell his stock i f he could not receive the bonuses he was entitled to. Watson tried to def use the confrontation by suddenly agreeing to advance Heidinger the monies h e needed. Watson wrote Rottke, \"When I was in Germany recently and t alked to Mr. Heidinger, he gave me to understand that he was in need of som e money to meet his living expenses. As a stockholder in your Company, I am writing this letter to advise you that it will be agreeable to us for y ou to lend Mr. Heidinger such amounts as you think he will require to take c are of his living ex- penses.\" 47 Watson's letter, of course, expressed his incident al approval as a mere stockholder—not as the controlling force in th e company—this to con- tinue the fiction that Dehomag was not foreign-cont rolled. At the very moment Watson was dictating his letter about Heidinger, Germany was involved in a savage occupation of Pola nd. WWII was under- way. So Watson was careful. He did not date the let ter to Rottke, or even send it directly to Germany. Instead, the correspon dence was simply handed to his secretary. She then mailed the authorizing l etter to an IBM auditor, J. C. Milner in Geneva, with a note advising, \"I ha ve been instructed by Mr. Watson to forward the enclosed letter for Mr. Herma nn Rottke to your care. Would you kindly see that the letter reaches him.\" The undated copy filed in Watson's office, however, was date-stamped \"Septemb er 13, 1939\" for filing purposes. 48 But Heidinger was not interested in further advance s, as these only deepened his tax dilemma. He wanted the alphabetize s and made that known to J. W. Schotte, IBM's newly promoted Europe an general manager in Geneva who acted as Watson's intermediary on the al phabetizer question. On September 27, 1939, the day a vanquished Poland for mally capitulated, Schotte telephoned Rottke and a Dehomag management team in Berlin to re- gretfully explain that Watson refused to transfer t he alphabetizes. Instead, Watson merely offered to arrange for Dehomag to tak e possession of thirty- four broken alphabetizers returned from Russia and lying dormant in a Ham- burg warehouse. They could be repaired and rehabili tated back into service. 49 An indignant Rottke refused \"most energetically on the grounds that"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"These are 'old junk' in which we are not the least interested.\" Schotte upped the offer, saying Watson warned Dehomag to take ove r the entire Russian ter- ritory. Rottke thought the prospect in principle se emed rather attractive because Dehomag could then gain foreign exchange. B ut, thought Rottke, all the benefits of Russian sales would be negated if t he German subsidiary was still compelled to pay IBM NY a 25 percent royalty. Preferring not to verbal- ize any of that, Rottke simply replied to Schotte t hat any ideas on servicing the Russian market should be expressed in writing. 50 Returning to the alphabetizes, Rottke repeatedly in sisted Schotte call Watson to recommend that he \"let us have these few machines.\" Schotte would not budge, saying they had been \"set aside for urge nt needs.\" From Rottke's view, the machines were in Nazi-annexed Austria, a territory now granted to Dehomag, and Watson would not let the Germans deplo y the existing ma- chines? Incensed and threatening, Rottke told Schot te, \"IBM is big enough to take care of its customers,\" adding, \"depriving us of these few machines might later be regretted.\" Schotte saw that Rottke' s limit was being reached. He promised to call Watson again and convey the sen timent in Berlin. 51 Schotte called Rottke the next morning, September 2 8, in friendly spir- its. It was all just a mistake on Watson's part, he was happy to say. Watson, claimed Schotte, thought the machines had never eve n been delivered to Austria. Watson had backed down again. Rottke was a ble to send a letter to Heidinger confirming that Dehomag is \"keeping the m achines I had asked for until further notice.\" 52 Dehomag's paperwork was quickly finalized: Alphabetical Summary Punch ... serial #517-10674-D9 *Transferred to Dehomag Alphabetical Summary Punch ... serial #517-10072 *Transferred to Dehomag Alphabetical Duplicating Printing Punch ... serial #034-11722-M8 *Transferred to Dehomag Alphabetical Duplicating Punch ... serial #034-11252 *Transferred to Dehomag Alphabetical Duplicating Punch ... serial #034-11253 *Transferred to Dehomag Alphabet-Interpreter. .. serial #552-10494-C9 *Transferred to Dehomag Alphabet-Interpreter . .. serial #552-10495-C9 *Transferred to Dehomag"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Alphabetical Printing Tabulating Machine serial#405 13126-D9 \"Transferred to Dehomag Alphabetical Printing Tabulating Machine . . . serial#405-13127-D9 \"Transferred to Dehomag Alphabetical Printing Tabulating Machine ... serial#405-13128-D9 \"Transferred to Dehomag Alphabetical Printing Tabulating Machine ... serial#405-11332 \"Transferred to Dehomag Alphabetical Printing Tabulating Machine ... serial#405-11000 \"Transferred to Dehomag Alphabetical Printing Tabulating Machine .,. serial#405-10206 \"Transferred to Dehomag Collator... serial#077-10577-D9 \"Transferred to Dehomag Just a week before, on September 21, 1939, Reinhard Heydrich, Chief of Himmler's Security Service, the SD, held a secre t conference in Berlin. Summarizing the decisions taken that day, he circul ated a top secret Express Letter to the chiefs of his Einsatzgruppen operatin g in the occupied territories. The ruthless Einsatzgruppen were special mobile tas k forces that fanned out through conquered lands sadistically murdering as m any Jews as they could as fast as they could. Frequendy, Jews were herded and locked into synagogues, which were then set ablaze as the people inside hop elessly tried to escape. More often, families were marched to trenches where the victims, many clutch- ing their young ones, were lined up, mercilessly sh ot in assembly line fashion, and then dumped into the earth by the hundreds. 54 But these methods were too sporadic and too inefficient to quickly destroy millions of people. Heydrich's September 21 memo was captioned: \"The Je wish Question in the Occupied Territory.\" It began, \"With referen ce to the conference which took place today in Berlin, I would like to point o ut once more that the total measures planned (i.e., the final aim) are to be ke pt strictly secret.\" Heydrich underlined the words \"total measures planned\" and \" stricdy secret.\" In parentheses, he used the German word Endziel for \"f inal aim.\" 55 His memo continued: \"A distinction is to be made be tween 1) The final aim (which will take some time) and 2) sections of the carrying out of this goal (which can be carried out in a short space of time). The measures planned require the most thorough preparation both from the technical and the economic point of view. It goes without saying that the tasks in this con- nection cannot be laid down in detail.\" 56 "},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"The very next step, the memo explained, was populat ion control. First, Jews were to be relocated from their homes to so-ca lled \"concentration towns.\" Jewish communities of less than 500 persons were di ssolved and consolidated into the larger sites. \"Care must be taken,\" wrote Heydrich, \"that only such towns be chosen as concentration points as are eith er railroad junctions or at least lie on a railway.\" Addressing the zone covere d by Einsatzgruppe I, which extended from east of Krakow to the former Slovak-P olish border, Heydrich directed, \"Within this territory, only a temporary census of Jews need be taken. The rest is to be done by the Jewish Council of Eld ers dealt with below.\" 57 Under the plan, each Jewish ghetto or concentration town would be compelled to appoint its own Council of Elders, gen erally rabbis and other prominent personalities, who would be required to s wiftly organize and man- age the ghetto residents. Each council would become known as a Judenrat, or Jewish Council. \"The Jewish Councils,\" Heydrich's m emo instructed his units, \"are to undertake a temporary census of the Jews, i f possible, arranged accord- ing to sex [ages: (a) up to 16 years, (b) from 16 t o 20 years, and (c) over], and according to the principal professions in their localities, and to report thereon within the shortest possible period.\" 58 Once in the ghetto, the instruction declared, Jews would be \"forbid- den to leave the ghetto, forbidden to go out after a certain hour in the evening, etc.\" 59 Heydrich demanded that \"the chiefs of the Einsatzgr uppen report to me continually regarding . . . the census of Jews in t heir districts. . . . The num- bers are to be divided into Jews who will be migrat ing from the country, and those who are already in the towns.\" 60 Some 3 million Polish Jews, during a sequence of su dden relocations, were to be catalogued for further action in a massi ve cascade of repetitive censuses, registrations, and inventories with up-to -date information being instantly available to various Nazi planning agenci es and military occupation offices. 61 How much food would the Jews require? How much usa ble forced labor for armament factories and useful skills coul d they generate? How many thousands would die from month to month under the new starvation regimen? Under wartime conditions, it would be a ma rvel of population reg- istration—a statistical feat. No time was to be los t. The Reich was ready. During summer 1939, the Office for Military- Economic Planning, with jurisdiction over Hollerith usage, had conducted its own study of the ethnic minorities in Poland. By No vember 2, 1939, Arlt, the statistics wizard who had already surveyed Leipzig Jews and their city-by- city ancestral roots in Poland, had been appointed head of the Population"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"and Welfare Administration of the \"General Governme nt,\" the new Reich name for occupied Poland. Arlt was devoted to popul ation registrations, race science i s s u es , and population politics. He e d i t e d his own statistical publica- tion, Volkspolitischer Informationsdienst der Regie rungen des Generalgouvern- merits (Political Information Service of the Genera l Government), based in Krakow. It featured such detailed data as Jewish po pulation per square meter with sliding projections of decrease resulting from such imposed conditions as forced labor and starvation. Arlt ruled out perm anent emigration, since this would only keep Jews in existence. Instead, on e article asserts, \"We can count on the mortality of some subjugated groups. T hese include babies and those over the age of 65, as well as those who are basically weak and ill in all other age groups.\" Only eliminating 1.5 million Jew s would reduce Jewish density to 110 persons per square kilometer. 62 In October 1939, the next counts began. UNLIKE G ERMAN , Austrian, and Czech Jewry, most of Polish Jewry was not assimilated. Intensely religious and not infrequend y cloistered into very sepa- rate communities, they were often discernible by ce rtain physical features that Eastern Europeans associated with Jews. Charac teristic dark beards and other facial attributes made their appearance very different from many Poles. Openly speaking Yiddish and Germanic dialects only set them further apart. In some neighborhoods, Jews wore traditional attire . Persecuted into the portable professions, Jews inhabited the merchant c lass and artisan crafts. In- deed, the Polish word for \"commerce\" was the German word handel, which Jews had Yiddishized. With well-developed schools a nd other institutions, as well as a unifying corporate communal body, a flour ishing Jewish and Yid- dish culture thrived in Poland. The Jews of Poland were often highly recog- nizable and frequendy resembled the stereotypical n otion anti-Semites harbored. In short, one didn't need a punch card-dr iven census to identify most of Polish Jewry. But for special measures Hitler had in mind, the Je ws of Poland did need to be counted and their possessions inventorie d. Moreover, the Nazis did need to identify the thousands of Jews who did not fit the physical and social stereotypes, had drifted away from the commu nal group or its neigh- borhoods, had become baptized, or who had simply as similated successfully into overall society. Once Germany invaded Poland, the vibrant Jewish exi stence there was quickly obliterated. First, as instructed by Heydri ch, Nazi forces created"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Judenrate, that is, Jewish Councils, across the cou ntry. In Warsaw, where a third of the city's million-plus residents were Jew ish, a balding engineer named Adam Czerniakow was abruptly appointed chairm an of the local Judenrat. Undoubtedly, he was chosen for his method ical, engineering mind. Czerniakow and his council of twenty-four handpicke d elders were charged with managing all civic affairs of the trapped Jewi sh population. It was the Council's responsibility to gain rigid compliance w ith the torrent of oppressive measures decreed by the Nazis as the Reich speedily dismanded the once- thriving community of some 375,000 Warsaw Jews. In their impossible task, the Judenrats every move was closely regulated by t he Gestapo, SS, Einsatz- gruppen, and other Nazi bodies. Nazi officers somet imes lurked just a few feet away at the window as Czerniakow worked in his office. 63 Statistics, registrations, and census would be an a ll-consuming duty for Czerniakow and his council during the coming days. On October 4, 1939, Czerniakow was called to the Ei nsatzgruppe offices on Szuch Avenue. As instructed, he immediately went to work on a statistical questionnaire. He continued to meet with Nazi offic ials daily. Each time he was summoned, he noted their escalating, almost non -negotiable demands and commands. October 7, the issue of statistics ca me up again. October 12, during a meeting with the SS, Czerniakow reviewed q uestions about the community's finances, forced labor contingents, and the forms to be used to record data. October 13, in meetings with the SS, C zerniakow again con- ferred on statistics wanted by the Germans and the forms to be used. 64 To swiftly transfer the Jews out of their homes and businesses across Warsaw and compress them into a small prison-like n eighborhood was a major population transfer that required detailed pl anning. The Nazis were already gathering house-by-house lists of residents from German-appointed \"courtyard commandants,\" this ostensibly to qualify occupants for food in a city where nearly all water, electricity, and trans portation had ceased. In addition, the Judenrat was required to compile list s of all Warsaw Jews between the ages of sixteen and sixty. 65 None of it was fast enough or complete enough. On O ctober 14, Ein- satzgruppen officers ordered the Judenrat to conduc t a full Jewish census bro- ken down by city district. Somehow, the Judenrat wo uld also have to identify the baptized Jews who were not part of the Jewish c ommunity. 66 German statistical officials already possessed the published figures of the Jewish population from the 1931 general Polish census. That census rou- tinely recorded citizens by religion and mother ton gue. So the Nazis could easily estimate that about 350,000 Jews lived in Wa rsaw. But many had fled as"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"the Blitzkried advanced into the Polish heartland a nd during the years of pre- war anti-Jewish agitation. Berlin needed precise nu mbers. They didn't care how. The Nazis demanded Czerniakow plan and execute the census taking. 67 The next day, as Czerniakow prepared for his task, Einsatzgruppe offi- cers and their Polish-born auxiliaries patrolling t he Jewish quarters contin- ued to sadistically terrorize Jews directly outside his office. Their favorite sport was pouncing on defenseless, pious Jews walki ng the streets and demonstratively cutting off their beards. Other tim es, they forced Jews down on all fours and then ordered neighbors to ride the m like donkeys in a race. Brutality to Jews on holy days or just before the S abbath was the most intense. Pork and butter were smeared across their lips to violate their kosher observance. Soldiers snapped endless photos of the merriment for keepsakes. As such outrages took place outside his window, Cze rniakow struggled to outline the logistics of the census. 68 On October 16, at 5 A . M ., Czerniakow resumed working on census tak- ing logistics and the questionnaire. On October 17, Czerniakow rose at dawn to begin a day of meetings to explain his duties, i ncluding a stop at the Polish Statistical Office to confer with its staff. On Oct ober 19, another meeting was held at the Polish Statistical Office. 69 On October 20, an Einsatzgruppen officer came to th e Jewish Commu- nity Center for a 3 P . M . meeting with Czerniakow, but the Judenrat chairman had already gone to the Security Police headquarter s for the meeting. It was a mix-up. Czerniakow was threatened with retaliatio n unless he came back quickly. By 5 P . M ., Czerniakow was summoned to yet another meeting, thi s one with the SS, again to review census plans. Of t he several competing Nazi entities occupying Warsaw, the SS decided its group would issue the census proclamation. 70 On October 21, Czerniakow met with officials from n oon until 2 P . M . at the Polish Statistical Office. From 3 P . M . until 6 P . M . he was at the SS again, hammering out plans for the census. During the diff icult conference, Czerni- akow tried to explain that the operation should be postponed until early November 3—but the Nazis refused to wait that long. Czerniakow was sent to another official for a protracted, stressful con ference and then ordered to conduct the census within one week, on October 28, and at Jewish expense. There was no time to deploy an army of census taker s. Instead, Jews would be ordered to appear at local census sites to fill out their forms. Czerniakow was dispatched to the Currency Control Office where officials unblocked some frozen Jewish accounts to defray census costs, such as printing ques- tionnaires. Czerniakow then rushed to meet a printe r and together they hur-"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"ried to the printing shop to discuss the final form at of the questionnaires demanded by the Germans, as well as posters announc ing the count. It was Czernaikow's responsibility to drive throughout the city that night hanging the announcement posters so they were visible in th e morning. Very late that day, fatigued and disconsolate, trying to reconcile with his God, Czerniakow finally returned home. He vomited. 71 In the morning, Czerniakow continued preparations f or the census, including naming twenty-six commissioners to overse e its thoroughness and reliability. The SS had a habit of taking hostages when compliance was required. 72 These men would surely be held responsible if anyt hing went amiss. On October 23, SS officers came to the Jewish Commu nity Center to monitor the Judenrat's plans to execute the count. October 26, at 1 P.M., Czerniakow toured census stations all over the city . Czerniakow spent the next day making final preparations, conferring with the census commission- ers and attending to last-minute details. 73 Chaim Kaplan was one of Warsaw Jewry's many eloquen t men of letters. A teacher, poet, and journalist, Kaplan had travele d to America and Palestine during the pre-War years. In his diary, on October 21, he wrote, \"Some time ago, I stated that our future is beclouded. I was w rong. Our future is becom- ing increasingly clear.\" He added, \"blessed be the righteous judge,\" the tradi- tional invocation chanted at funerals and upon hear ing of a death. 74 On October 25, Kaplan recorded, \"Another sign that bodes ill: Today, notices informed the Jewish population of Warsaw th at next Saturday there will be a census of the Jewish inhabitants. . . . O ur hearts tell us of evil— some catastrophe for the Jews of Warsaw lies in thi s census. Otherwise there would be no need for it.\" 75 Kaplan had witnessed rabbis brutally beaten and the ir beards forcibly cut. He had seen elderly women yanked at the jaw wi th riding crops. Inno- cent people were compelled to dance atop tables for hours on end. On the day of the census, Kaplan wrote, \"These people must be considered psy- chopaths and sadists, because normal people are inc apable of such abom- inable acts. .. .\" He also wrote: \"The order for a census stated that it is being held to gather data for administrative purposes. Th at's a neat phrase, but it contains catastrophe.... We are certain that this c ensus is being taken for the purpose of expelling 'nonproductive elements' And t here are a great many of us now.... We are all caught in a net, doomed to de struction.\" 76 Kaplan was not alone in fearing the census. Czernia kow was besieged with questions about the purpose of this count. 77 The deeply Talmudic com-"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"munity, which had little left except its faith and teachings, understood well that censuses were ominous in Jewish history. The B ible itself taught that unless specifically ordered by God, the census is e vil because through it the enemy will know your strength: I Chronicles 21: Satan rose up against Israel and i ncited David to take a cen- sus of Israel. . . . This command was also evil in the sight of God. . . Then David said to God, \"I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now I beg you to take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very fooli sh thing.\" 78 On October 28, 1939, for the Jewish people of Warsa w, everything stopped. That day they were counted. Throughout the day, thousands of census forms were brought to the Jewish Community Center, generally by the house sup erintendents in Jewish buildings. 79 The results came with almost magical speed. In a li ttle more than forty- eight hours, all the forms had been counted. By Oct ober 31, Czerniakow had been informed there were some 360,000 Jews in Warsa w. The exact number was 359,827, revealing the community's precise dime nsions: Jews infancy to age 15: ... 46,172 men and 45,439 women; Jews aged 16-59 .. . 104,273 men and 131,784 women; Jews aged 60 and over ... 13 ,325 men and 16,933 women; undetermined . . . only 537 men and 1,364 wo men. Employed . . . 155,825. Unemployed, including infants and invalids . . . 204,002. Artisans .. . 73,435. The Germans even knew that many Jewish artisans were practic- ing without a license by comparing the census resul ts with the actual number of artisan licenses previously issued by the local authorities. 80 The next day, Czerniakow was ordered to submit a co mplete report on the census within two weeks. On November 2, even as crews began burying masses of typhus and dysentery victims created by t he squalid conditions, Czerniakow discovered he could not pay all of the c ollateral expenses of the census. 81 By November 20, all census matters had been complet ed, although the Nazis were planning the ghetto to approximate the o utlines of the already overcrowded Nalewki district. The signs at its boun dary would read: Ach- tung! Seuchengefahr. Eintritt verboten (Attention: Epidemics—Entry Prohib- ited). The seizure of all Jewish funds was being re adied. But the Nazis still wanted the baptized Jews. It was Czerniakow's probl em. He solved it some- how by producing a list of Christian converts, whic h he handed over on December 6, 1939. By December 9, the authorities ha d revised their number of Jews in Warsaw to 366,000, the extra 6,000 appar ently accounting for the so-called racial Jews. 82 "},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Now the Reich knew exactly how many Jews were under their jurisdic- tion, how much nutrition to allocate—as low as 184 calories per person per day. They could consolidate Jews from the mixed dis tricts of Warsaw, and bring in Jews from other nearby villages. The trans ports began arriving. White armbands with Jewish stars were distributed. Everyone, young or old, was required to wear one on the arm. Not the forear m, but the arm—visible, above the elbow. The Warsaw-Malkinia railway line r an right through the pro- posed ghetto. It was all according to Heydrich's Se ptember 21 Express Let- ter. Soon the demarcated ghetto would be surrou nded by barbed wire. Eventually, a wall went up, sealing the residents o f the ghetto from the outside world. Soon thereafter, the railway station would b ecome the most feared lo- cation in the ghetto. 83 The Nazi quantification and regimentation of Jewish demographics in Warsaw and indeed all of Poland was nothing less th an spectacular—an al- most unbelievable feat. Savage conditions, secrecy, and lack of knowledge by the victims would forever obscure the details of ex actly how the Nazis man- aged to tabulate the cross-referenced information o n 360,000 souls within forty-eight hours. But this much is known: The Third Reich possessed o nly one method of tabulating censuses: Dehomag's Hollerith system. Moreover, IBM was in Poland, headquartered in Warsaw. In fact, the punch card print shop was just yard s from the Warsaw Ghetto at Rymarska Street 6. That's where they pro- duced more than 20 million cards. WATSON DID NOT really want Poland until 1934. Why? Because that's when Powers had encroached on IBM business in the Polish market. Watson would not tolerate that. There were so few potential punch card customers in Poland, in the years before Hitler, that IBM didn't even maintain a subsidiary there. Wat- son's company was only represented by the independe nt Block-Brun agency. Since the struggling Powers Company sought its few customers wherever IBM didn't dominate, Powers felt free to operate in Poland. Then, in a 1934 sales coup, Powers convinced the Polish Ministry of Posts to replace its Holle- rith equipment with rival Powers' machines. 84 Just as Patterson believed all cash register busine ss \"belonged\" to the NCR, Watson believed all punch card business innate ly \"belonged\" to IBM. When IBM lost the Polish postal service, Watson rea cted at once. First, he replaced the Block-Brun agency with a full-fledged IBM subsidiary named"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Polski Hollerith. 85 But who would run the new subsidiary? Watson wante d J. W. Schotte. Jurriaan W. Schotte was born in Amsterdam in 1896, just about the time Herman Hollerith incorporated his original tab ulating company. Schotte was eminendy qualified for the international punch card business. His back ground included civil engineering and military serv ice. He was fluent in Dutch, French, and German, and could speak some Rom anian and Malay. He had traveled extensively throughout Europe, and enj oyed good commercial and governmental connections. After a stint at the Dutch Consulate in Mini- ster, Germany, he was employed by Dutch import-expo rt companies in New York, San Francisco, and the East Indies. He knew m anufacturing, having managed a factory in Belgium. Schotte was perfect f or another reason: He was Powers' European sales manager. Schotte was the one who had sold the Powers machines to the Polish Post Office. 86 Schotte had worked his way up through the Powers or ganization. Start- ing as a factory inspector at its U.S. affiliate, h e had risen to maintenance supervisor and instructor throughout Europe. A fier ce sales competitor, he had deftly operated out of Powers' offices in Paris , Vienna, and Berlin. Most valuable, Schotte knew all of Powers' customers and prospects throughout the continent. 87 By 1934, however, Dehomag had so thoroughly squeeze d Powers in Germany, including its lawsuit for falsely claiming to be an Aryan concern, that Schotte admitted he had \"nowhere to go but out .\" He traveled to New York to meet with J.T. Wilson, the head of IBM NY's Foreign Trade Depart- ment. Schotte hoped to salvage his career by becomi ng a European represen- tative for IBM. Wilson was unsure. Schotte brought a great deal of insider knowledge, but he had been the bitter competition f or some time. So Wilson only tentatively hired Schotte, and then cabled the various subsidiaries ask- ing their opinion. 88 The reports were not good. Heidinger curtly dismiss ed the suggestion, calling Schotte \"an unscrupulous price-cutter.\" IBM 's Geneva office was equally unenthusiastic. But Watson thought otherwis e—Schotte was just what IBM needed in the new Europe. During a meeting in W atson's office, Watson dramatically painted a tantalizing picture of the f uture of Europe, one that excited Schotte because he could play a central rol e in IBM's plans. He could return to Europe as IBM's Manager for Southeast Eur ope with a handsome compensation package. Schotte was later described a s \"in awe\" and \"walking over clouds\" as the meeting ended and he stepped to the door of Watson's office. But his euphoria was cut short when Watson abrupdy declared, \"Mr."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Schotte your employment in IBM depends on your gett ing IBM machines back into the Polish Postal Service.\" 89 Schotte sailed back to Europe and, as Watson had in sisted, persuaded the Polish Postal Service to switch back to Holleri th machines. 90 Watson would have Poland again. Hitler also wanted Poland. Nazi doctrine had long c alled for the con- quest of Polish territory, the subjugation of its p eople as inferiors, and the destruction of its more than three million Jewish c itizens that comprised the largest Jewish community in Europe. Moreover, the R eich was determined to confiscate Poland's significant natural resource s and industry, including timber, coke, coal, and steel making in Upper Siles ia. Upper Silesia was adja- cent to the Sudeten region and many Volksdeutsche l ived in its cities. Hitler considered the area German. By 1935, the year of the Nuremberg racial laws, Pol ski Hollerith had opened a card punching service bureau in Warsaw. Th e next year, IBM opened a second Polish office, this one in the Upper Siles ian city of Katowice, and then a card printing facility in Warsaw serving a c ustomer base requiring 36 million cards per year. In 1937, Polski Hollerit h signed the Polish Min- istry of Railroads. That year, IBM changed its name to Watson Business Ma- chines sp. z. o.o. and appointed an IBM salesman of Polish extraction, Janusz Zaporski, as temporary manager. Ironically, althoug h IBM owned and con- trolled 100 percent of the company, as he had done so often before, Watson chose to register the stock not in the company's na me, but in the name of his Geneva managers. In this case, it was IBM Europe Ge neral Manager John Holt and IBM's Geneva auditor J. C. Milner, as well as a token share—the equivalent of $200—in the name of a Polish national . By the time the com- pany changed names to Watson Business Machines sp. z. o.o in 1937, IBM had garnered only twenty-five customers in Poland. But the list included some of the country's most vital industry giants, such as t he Baildon steelworks. More importantly, by this time, the subsidiary had organ ized the nation's freight cars and locomotives, and through the Polish Postal Service could control access to every address in Poland. 91 After Hitler invaded Poland in September 1939, IBM NY awarded the lucrative Upper Silesia industrial territory to Deh omag, negotiating the dis- position of each of the pre-existing machines. Then Watson recast his Polish subsidiary as an Aryan entity by re-incorporating a s a German company and affixing a German language name, Watson Biiromaschi nen GmbH, with the recognizable, German incorporation suffix. The offi ce in war-torn Warsaw was moved to Kreuz 23, and the company appointed a German manager,"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Alexander von Dehn. Von Dehn was only in charge of the remnant Polish ter- ritory, that is, the vanquished and subjugated rema inder known in Hitler par- lance as the \"General Government.\" All but two of t he previous Polish customers of the remnant subsidiary had disappeared , since the Polish infra- structure ceased to exist except as a vassal to the Germans. 92 Yet, after adjusting for the effects of the invasio n, the subsidiary thrived for years under the murderous Nazi regime. IBM's Ge rman or Polish subsidi- aries, separately or in tandem, serviced the occupy ing Nazi needs through the German military's constandy changing punch card agency, which ulti- mately became known as Maschinelles Berichtwesen (M B), or the Office for Automated Reporting. The MB maintained Polish field offices in Posen, Krakow, Stettin, and Danzig. Each MB office was typ ically equipped with one alphabetical tabulator and duplicator, ten alphabet ical punchers and proof- ers, eight magnetic punchers and proofers, one D-11 tabulator with summary capabilities, and two or three sorters. One or two Wehrmacht officers super- vised a typical support staff of several dozen as w ell as one or two on-site so-called Hollerith experts. Dehomag itself was in charge of all MB office training, leasing, upkeep, and custom-printed punch cards and design of spe- cialized applications. The projects were as diverse as a so-called \"horse cen- sus\" of all horses and mules in Poland, which would help move German elements through the harsh Polish winter, to the sh ipments of coal. IBM Geneva was so proud of the horse census, conducted in spring 1940, that they quickly included it in a special report to IBM 's Washington office de- scribing the lucrative war profiteering of the vari ous European subsidiaries. 93 During the years of Nazi-overrun Poland, deniabilit y continued to be a precious imperative. IBM NY continued to operate th rough its intermedi- aries, nominees, and Geneva managers. It would alwa ys be able to say it was unaware of Watson Buromaschinen's activities and th e paperwork would be nearly impossible to trace. For example, the subsidiary's account at Handlowy B ank in Warsaw, referred to as \"number 4B,\" was actually an IBM acc ount, controlled from Geneva. An administrator later described the arrang ement in these words: \"In this manner, the IBM's account was at the same time the business capital of the Warsaw company, as Herr von Dehn was entitle d to take sums from the account for the purposes of the Warsaw company. \" Despite the horrific conditions in Warsaw, IBM maintained close control of the account after the invasion. On February 10, 1940, IBM gave von Dehn w ritten authority to receive customer payments, that is, physically \"rec eive\" them. The actual per- mission for von Dehn to deposit the payments in IBM 's account, \"after"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"deduction of the sums necessary for the conduct of the management,\" was only oral. 94 In summer 1940, long after Hitler had invaded numer ous other coun- tries in Kurope, and after the Warsaw Ghetto was be ing sealed, Watson wanted his Polish operation to stay intact. On July 29, 1940, a key official of the IBM Geneva office, known as P. Taylor, had writ ten to von Dehn convey- ing Watson's instruction that the families of all m arried men who had worked for the subsidiary prior to the invasion should be given special financial assistance. This subvention was to be paid from the company account. Ini- tially, the gesture was prompted by confiscatory Na zi economic decrees and labor restrictions, which canceled the expected Chr istmas 1939 bonus. Two months pay was offered as a so-called \"loan,\" and, as an administrator later explained, \"in order to keep up the appearance of t he loan, the recipients paid back minimal amounts each month.\" Von Dehn was included in the company welfare, which exemplified the IBM ethic of taking care of \"the company's own.\" Such assistance encouraged loyalty from employees even during the war. The company also granted food loans . Soon, the loan policy was extended to unmarried employees as well. Eventu ally, the employee loan program, which was similar to programs Watson had d eclared in other coun- tries, amounted to more than 135,000 zlotys or appr oximately $27,000. IBM Geneva also authorized small loans to its war-devas tated suppliers totaling more than 8,000 zlotys. 95 IBM machinery was placed throughout the General Gov ernment, in- cluding two alphabetizes and accessory machines, wh ich had been brought in by the invading German army. Dehomag rented them to the Polish users, retaining 25 percent of the income. The remainder w ent to Watson Buro- maschinen. Among the few remaining clients were Pol ish Railways and the Krakow Statistical Office. 96 The subsidiary's machinery in occupied Poland was i nsured in the United States. In 1940, von Dehn asked IBM to incre ase the insurance in view of wartime conditions. But this would have inv olved paperwork. IBM declined to do so. 97 As for Block-Brun, IBM's former agency, it was excl uded from nearly all of IBM's expansion in Poland. Block -Brun switched to Powers, the only minor competitor left in punch card techno logy. But the residual Powers business was paltry. So Block-Brun was eager to retain a tertiary role as a local supplier of IBM control mechanisms. An admi nistrator who later looked for a written contract with Block-Brun could never find one. This relationship also appeared to be oral. Under the cloudy arrangem ent, IBM sold the control"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"mechanisms at Block-Brun's own risk, requiring the Polish agency to pay the import freight to Warsaw. These parts were not sold into Poland by Dehomag, but directly by IBM either in New York or Europe. W atson required Block- Brun to pay the import fees. All sales were final w ith Block-Brun immediately assuming ownership once the apparatuses were ordere d. But IBM's terms often allowed the agency to pay into the Bank Handl owy account only after the merchandise was sold, generally six to fifteen months after receipt. 98 IBM was receiving the money for years after the invasio n. Block-Brun's sales on behalf of IBM were often wron gly listed as \"con- signments,\" which meant IBM would have owned the de vices until sale, paid tax immediately, and assumed all risk for war damag e. IBM refused to honor any appearance of consignment. For example, in 1939 , a shipment worth $12,134 was severely damaged. Block-Brun negotiated with IBM for years before IBM finally agreed to take the machines back via Sweden. Due to war conditions, the machines never made it back.\" After the Nazis invaded Poland, IBM maintained its punch card printing operation at Rymarska Street 6. Three printing mach ines and one card cutter employed just two people, using paper brought in fr om Germany. Ultimately, during the occupation years, the shop at Rymarska p roduced as many as 10 million cards per year. 100 In 1939, Rymarska Street 6 stood along a very short , tree-lined lane, opposite a plaza fountain, just yards from the Jewi sh district that in 1940 would become the walled-in Warsaw Ghetto. The stree t itself had long pos- sessed a Jewish character. In 1928, before IBM inha bited it, Rymarska 6 housed the Salon for Jewish Art. The property had b een owned, at one point, by the Hirszfeld brothers. In addition to a gallery, the street had become known for print shops. Rymarska 8 housed the Pospieszna printer and the \"Union\" printer was a few doors down. But a fter the Nazis arrived, Jews lost their property to Aryan or Polish concern s. When, in 1940, the War- saw Ghetto was walled in, the often-adjusted perime ter cut right through Rymarska Street, oddly circumventing the print shop s in an almost U-shaped deviation. Rymarska 1-5 and Rymarska 11-20 ended up within the Ghetto. Rymarska 6 and a few other shops remained outside t he ghetto. Thus, most of the printing operations continued undisturbed. 101 Statistical operations resembling the Warsaw census were established in ghettos all across Poland. Although the incessant c ounts and voluminous card files were implemented and maintained by the J udenrate under merci- less Nazi coercion, the vital statistics were not c ertified as final until they were approved by the fully equipped city statistica l offices outside the ghetto"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"walls. Ultimately, the ghettos developed elaborate s t a t i s t i c a l bureaus. In some cases, they were required to p u b l i s h t h e i r own stat istical yearbooks. The Czestochowa Ghetto's three statistical bulletins in 1940 totaled some 400 pages of detailed demographic and subsistence analy sis. 102 Poland was not the only focal point for Reich stati stical action. A Statis- tical Office for the Protectorate of Bohemia and Mo ravia was opened in Prague in 1939. Data services were also opened in U pper Silesia and the Warthe region where IBM had transferred the territo ry to Dehomag. 103 After the 1939 invasion, Heydrich of the Security S ervice, the official who had sent out the all-defining September 21 Express Letter, sent a follow-up cable to his occupying forces in Poland, Upper Sile sia, and Czechoslovakia, This cable oudined how a new census scheduled for D ecember 17, 1939, would escalate the process from mere identification and cataloging to depor- tation and execution as people were rapidly moved i nto Polish ghettos to await the next step. 104 Heydrich's memo, entitled \"Evacuation of the New Ea stern Provinces,\" decreed: \"The evacuation of Poles and Jews in the n ew Eastern Provinces will be conducted by the Security Police . . . The census documents provide the basis for the evacuation. All persons in the ne w provinces possess a copy. The census form is the temporary identification car d giving permission to stay. Therefore, all persons have to hand over the card before deportation ... anyone caught without this card is subject to possi ble execution.... It is pro- jected that the census will take place on December 17, 1939.\" 105 More than a half-million people were to be deported from the Warthe region alone, based on \"Statistical information (ce nsus lists, etc.) from Ger- man and Polish sources, investigative results of th e Security Police and the Security Service, and surveys ... [which would] con stitute the foundation.\" 106 How long would it take to quantify and organize the deportation of millions from various regions across Eastern Europe based upon a December 17 census? Relying upon the lightning speed of Holl erith machines, Hey- drich was able to assert, \"That means the large-sca le evacuation can begin no sooner than around January 1, 1940.\" 107 Ultimately, the late December census took place ove r several days, from December 17 to December 23, 1939. Each person over the age of twelve was required to fill out census and registration in dup licate, and was then finger- printed. Part of the form was stamped and returned as the person's new identification form. Without it, they would be shot . With it, they would be deported. 108 December was a busy month for IBM's German subsidia ry—and"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"extremely profitable. Throughout Germany and the co nquered territories, Dehomag frantically tried to keep up with the pace of unending censuses, registrations, and analyses of people, property, an d military operations that required its equipment, repair services, and card p rocessing. Millions of cards were printed each week just to meet the demand. Und erstandably, whereas Rottke had been incensed at Watson's initial refusa l to transfer the alphabet- izers as requested, all the hard feelings were now gone. D ECEMBER 6, 1939 Mr. Thomas J.

Mrs. Rottke and my two sons add their good wi shes hereto. I take this opportunity to thank you again most heartily f or the understand- ing by you in regard to my requests during the past year. I hope that the difficult times, which have come over the Europ ean nations once more, will not last too long. My family and I are e njoying good health, which I sincerely trust is also the case with yours elf and your family. With very kindest regards, I am Very sincerely yours, Herman Rottke 109 In early 1940, IBM Geneva sent Watson a statement o f Dehomag's 1939 profits. The numbers were almost double the pr evious year, total- ing RM 3,953,721 even after all the royalty income and other disguised revenue. The Dehomag profit statement to Watson als o explained that some- how almost half the 1939 profit, RM 1,800,000, was suddenly recorded in December 1939. 110 The strategic alliance with Hitler continued to pay off in the cities and in the ghettos. But now IBM machines would demonstr ate their special value along the railways and in the concentration camps o f Europe. Soon the Jews would become Hollerith numbers."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"8 WITH B L I T Z K R I E G E F F I C I E N C Y HITLER'S ARMIES SWARMED OVER EUROPE TH ROUGHOUT the first months of 1940. The forces of the Reich s laughtered all opposition with a military machine unparalleled in human history. Blitzkrieg—lightning war—was more than a n ew word. Its very utterance signified coordinated death under th e murderous onslaught of Hitler's massive air, sea, and 100,000 -troop ground assaults. Nothing could stop Germany. Nazi Europe—and Berlin's new world order—was becomi ng a reality. Austria: annexed in March 1938. Sudetenlan d: seized October 1938. Czechoslovakia: dismembered March 1939, and t he Memel re- gion ceded from Lithuania that same month. Poland: invaded Sep- tember 1939. By January 1940, nearly 42 million peo ple had come under brutal German subjugation. Disease, starvatio n, shattered lives, and fear became the desolate truth across th e Continent. The Jews were running out of refuges. One overrun s anctuary after another slid back into the familiar nightmare of registration, confiscation, and ghettoization. No sooner did the Swastika flag of occupation unfurl, than the anti-Semitic decrees ro lled out.

By spring 1940, Nazi Germany began dismembering Scandi navia and the Low Countries. April 9, the Wehrmacht invaded Denmark a nd Norway. Several days later, tiny Luxembourg was taken. May 15, Germ any crushed Holland into complete submission. May 28, Belgium capitulat ed to German forces. During April and May, Germany's enslavement jurisdi ction grew to 65 mil lion Europeans. 1 Cities across Europe smoldered in ruin. Warsaw was pulverized into a shambles. Rotterdam was mercilessly bombed even aft er its surrender on May 14 because, as Berlin propagandists explained, Dutch officials exceeded the ultimatum deadline by some twenty minutes. An e laborate Nazi newsreel, filmed by parachuting cameramen, showed Rotterdam a lmost completely aflame. Airports at Brussels and Antwerp were bombe d and strafed by hun- dreds of Luftwaffe planes. 2 Nazi-commandeered trains crisscrossed the continent hauling into Ger- many looted coal, scrap metal, foodstuffs, machiner y, and the other essentials Berlin craved. \"When they weren't carrying raw mate rials, or transporting troops, the railroad cars freighted conscripted lab or en route to work pro- jects as well as expelled Jews destined for concent ration camps. 3 Mass executions, organized plunder, and ruthless in vasion—these blared across the front pages of the newspapers, the frame s of newsreels, and the broadcasts of radio news. Germany was portrayed in emotional headlines and feature articles as a savage, murderous nation bent on destroying and dominating all of Europe no matter how many people died. On April 2, Poland's exile government declared that in addition to a million prisoners and forced laborers transported to German work site s, an estimated 2.5 mil- lion had died as a result of military action, execu tions, starvation, or frigid homelessness. Headlines continued as the New York T imes grossly exagger- ated the five days of Germany's invasion of the Net herlands which com- menced May 10; the newspaper claimed a quarter of t he Dutch army was killed-more than 100,000 (even though the number wa s 2,200). 4 Moreover, millions of Jews were now clearly earmark ed for death by virtue of Hitler's oppressive measures. In November 1939, the New York Times published reports from Paris declaring that 1 .5 million Jews trapped in Poland were in danger of starving to death. On Janu ary 21, 1940, World Jew- ish Congress Chairman Nahum Goldmann warned a Chica go crowd of 1,000, as well as wire service reporters, that if the war continued for another year 1 million Polish Jews would die of calculated starv ation or outright murder."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"such dire predictions only capped years of saturati on media coverage about inhumane Jewish persecution and horrifying concentr ation camps. 5 Indeed, whenever Jewish persecution was reported, t he media invari- ably reported the incessant registrations and censu ses as Nazidom's initial step. The methodology, technology, and the connecti on to IBM were still far below public awareness. But some specifics were beg inning to appear. For example, a March 2, 1940, New York Times article, e ntitled \"Jews in Cracow Move to Ghettos,\" described how 80,000 Jews had bee n herded into over- crowded flats in a squalid urban district devoid of resources. \"A common sight,\" the report asserted, \"is the white armband with the blue Star of David, which all Jews must wear by government decree . . . [signifying] their regis- tration in the government card file.\" 6 Only with great caution could Watson now publicly d efend the Hitler agenda, even through euphemisms and code words. Mos t Americans would not tolerate anyone who even appeared to be a Nazi sympathizer or collabo- rator. So, as he had done since Kristallnacht in la te 1938, Watson continued to insert corporate distance between himself and al l involvement in the affairs of his subsidiaries in Nazi Europe—even as he micro-managed their day-to-day operations. More than ever, he now chann eled his communica- tions to Nazi Europe through trusted intermediaries in Genev a and else- where on the Continent. He controlled subsidi ary operations through attorneys and employees acting as nominee owners, f ollowing the pattern set in Czechoslovakia and Poland. 7 In May 1940, as American society prepared for an in evitable war with Hitler, Watson worked to secure the underpinnings o f his public image. He intensified his advocacy for peace, and against all war. \"Universal peace is one of the most desirable, most worthwhile ideals in the world today,\" Watson insisted in a May 4 spe ech to reporters. \"It can- not be sold by a few people working in widely scatt ered communities. The project requires a worldwide organization of enthus iastic, hard-working in- dividuals selling the gospel of peace.\" 8 Watson advertised IBM as such an organization. Four days later, on May 8, Watson told reporters th at the company's lat- est course held in Endicott, New York, for IBM sale s representatives from twenty-four countries was to \"enable the students . .. to make greater contri- butions to the cause of world peace through world t rade.\" 9 Watson's advocacy for peace was limitless. May 13, 1940, was pro- claimed IBM Day at the World's Fair being held that month in New York."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"IBM Day was nothing less than an extravaganza of or chestrated adulation for the company. A dozen chartered trains brought in 7, 000 IBM employees and their wives from company facilities across the nati on to visit the architectonic IBM Pavilion. Each IBMer wore a red ribbon of solid arity with the company. Two thousand lucky ones were chosen to be feted at a massive Waldorf-Asto- ria dinner. Special congratulations to IBM, as usua l, were issued by leading politicians from President Roosevelt to the Mayor o f New York. To underscore the drama, Watson commissioned an original orchestr al work, The IBM Sym- phony, a bombastic composition dedicated to the upl ifting spirit of the firm. 10 The climax of IBM Day, however, was Watson's speech on the subject of peace. He delivered his sermon to 30,000 special ly invited guests gathered at the vast Court of Peace located in front of the sweeping USA Pavilion. Mutual Radio broadcast the highly publicized event countrywide. 11 Peace was Watson's message. War was bad, he argued at every opportu- nity. It would prove nothing but military might, wa ste lives and precious resources. War was in fact the worst recourse for t he world, and all right- thinking men should be opposed to any involvemen t with it, Watson pleaded. As head of the Carnegie Endowment for Inte rnational Peace, Wat- son everywhere proclaimed his driving mantra: \"Worl d Peace through World Trade.\" Indeed, Watson must have seemed to the publ ic like the very cham- pion of peace and the arch adversary of all conflic t. Ironically, at that very moment, Watson and IBM were in fact Europe's most s uccessful organizers not of peace, but of the ravages of war. Even as Watson was preaching the imperatives of pea ce, IBM was ecsta- tic about its accomplishments revolutionizing warfa re not only for the Third Reich, but also for its Axis allies and even other European nations about to be vanquished by Hitler. In spring 1940, J. W Schotte, IBM's general manager for Europe, dispatched a confidential report from h is Geneva office to senior IBM executives in America. Schotte's dispatch addre ssed the activities not only of just Dehomag, but also of the two dozen European subsidiaries and agen- cies that worked as inter-connected branches of the New York company. 12 Schotte's enthusiastic memo was entitled \"Our Deali ngs with War Min- istries in Europe.\" It began, \"Up to about one and a half years ago [about the time of Krristallnacht in 1938], our negotiatio ns with the war ministries of the twenty-four countries which are under the ju risdiction of IBM Euro- pean headquarters in Geneva, had not been very succ essful. This was due to several reasons, but mainly to the fact that in military circles administra- tion was considered a 'necessary evil' of little im portance for the defense of the country.\" 13 "},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"IBM had f i n a l l y succeeded in gaining the necessary insider access to sensitive military projects, Schotte reported, so t hat company engineers could properly design punch card applications for war use . Schotte explained that in prior years \"the military men in Europe have bee n reluctant to reveal their problems and programs to civilians. It has been ove rlooked in such instances that there is a distinct difference between knowing which problems exist and what system is applied, and the data and figures to which the system has to be applied.\" 14 As such, Schotte drew a fine theoretical distincti on between IBM possessing specific knowledge of the facts abou t a military operation, such as the number of people to be counted or a lis t of German bombing raids, and the actions themselves. The big change in military acceptance of Hollerith systems appeared at the end of 1938, confirmed Schotte, when \"in German y a campaign started for, what has been termed . . . 'organization of th e second front.'\" He elabo- rated, \"In military literature and in newspapers, t he importance and neces- sity of having in all phases of life, behind the fr ont, an organization which would remain intact and would function with 'Blitzk rieg' efficiency . . . was brought out. What we had been preaching in vain for years all at once began to be realized.\" 15 Schotte's memo made clear that only at IBM's initia tive did the mili- tarists comprehend what magic they could achieve wi th Hollerith automa- tion. \"Lectures on the punched card system were hel d by our representatives before officials of the general staff of various co untries and, with our men, the study of possible applications was begun . . . progress was rather slow, and it was not until about eight or nine months ago [summer 1939] when conditions in Europe clearly indicated that a war w as more or less unavoid- able, that the matter became acute.\" 16 Asserting that IBM sold to either side and had enjo yed an ever-escalating volume since the summer of 1939, Schotte's memo dec lared, \"The War Minis- tries of Yugoslavia, Rumania, Hungary, Poland, Swed en, Holland and France (these are the ones that I remember very distinctly from memory) sent us or- ders for punched card equipment, some of which is a lready installed, others being installed when the war started, and further e quipment not yet installed or still in transport.\" 17 Revenues from IBM's dominant customer, the Third Re ich, was grow- ing so rapidly, Schotte said he did not yet possess the sales numbers. \"We have no details of Germany,\" he reported, \"but know that a large amount of punched card equipment is being used by the War Min istry.\" He added that so great was Germany's need in the months before an d after the invasion of"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Poland that the Reich began requisitioning machines . Indeed, the agency u l t i m a t e l y known as the Maschinelles Berichtwese n (MB) had exercised full authority over all punch card technology since 1937. \"In the second half of 1939,\" wrote Schotte, \"most of our equipment was 's eized' and used to sup- plement the installations already in operation.\" 18 Once war erupted, the haste to add machines for mil itary use was not confined to Germany. Schotte's report noted that \"r ush orders were placed with us\" by those countries not yet properly automa ted. Most IBM subsidiaries were two years behind in filling orders, so many wa r ministries hurried their orders just to get in queue. \"To make up for lost t ime,\" Schotte continued, \"Holland and France gave us blank orders for a larg e quantity of machines, although our studies were not completed for several of the uses, and the quantities of required machines not established. As late as February 1940, the French War Ministry ordered a very substantial quantity of machines.\" 19 Schotte's report clarified that not all war applica tions were handled direcdy by war ministries. Numerous systems had bee n conveyed to private industry, \"but are for their [war ministry] use and under their control.\" Therefore, even though a coal mine or insurance com pany might be listed as the account, utilization of the machines was dictat ed by military needs either on the original corporate premises or moved to a mo re secure location alto- gether. Indeed, by spring 1940, his memo confirmed, many such systems had already been relocated to more protected sites, the report acknowledged. 20 Widespread expansion of punch card systems for war was ironically undermined in various countries by the draft itself , which infringed on the punch card workforce, asserted Schotte. Howeve r, eventually, military officials exempted \"key men in our installations [w ho then] remained at their posts.\" Moreover, \"supervisors and our indispen sable servicemen were released for such work.\" Even still, he added, \"A g reat inconvenience was caused due to the sudden extension of equipment in most countries, a short- age of trained supervisors and punch operators. Ads were placed in the papers and such operators lured away from one insta llation to another by offering higher salaries. We hurriedly started trai ning schools for key punch operators and supervisors, and of course servicemen who would be exempted from military service due to age or physic al condition.\" 21 Europe's militarists had finally realized the indis pensable advantages Hollerith instilled into modern warfare, boasted Sc hotte. Punch cards freed up manpower. Schotte cited a typical case: \"For exa mple, in Hungary with one set of machines and a few operators we replaced about sixty men.\" He added that the machines \"work twenty-four hours wit hout vacation. The"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"place and location is immaterial and machines have been installed in bomb- proof cellars. . . . There is no l i m i t to the flexi bility and adaptability of the machines, provided the mass of data to be handled i s sufficiendy large.\" 22 Most importandy, stressed Schotte, Hollerith mach ines guaranteed \"speed in handling mass records and data. Such spee d would be absolutely impossible by manual methods,\" he stressed. 23 Schotte's report included a list of IBM's remarkabl e accomplishments for the armies of war-ravaged Europe. Personal info rmation about every officer and soldier resided on Hollerith systems. I n France, for example, the actual \"mobilization call to each officer was print ed by our equipment by means of punch cards.\" Hollerith machines controlle d all payrolls to both armies and civilian workers in munitions factories. 24 So comprehensive was IBM Europe's data on both Germ any and its enemies that Schotte's memo was able to assert that the punch cards main- tained \"records of each and every Communist and Naz i.\" 25 Records were also kept \"on skilled laborers by prof ession, industry, etc. Such records are kept to control the potential of w ar material manufacture,\" Schotte's memo specified. 26 The labor data tersely alluded to in just a few wor ds in Schotte's memo was profoundly vital to Hitler. These automated rep orts allowed the Reich to strategically deploy both the skilled laborers with in Germany and the con- scripted work brigades and slave gangs shipped in f rom occupied countries. It was a daunting organizational challenge. By the end of 1940, the number of such onscripted and other slave workers totaled nea rly 2.5 million. Reporting formats continuously evolved as the Reich's needs c hanged and Hollerith tech- nology improved to keep up. Eventually, reporting c ategories included what Germany considered its entire manpower pool, from c ompany owners to skilled workers to unskilled laborers, divided into male and female columns. As time evolved, the various cross-indexed reports further classified the cate- gories into \"Reich residents, civilian foreigners, prisoners and Jews,\" as well as others. Germany's punch card control agency, Mas chinelles Berichtwesen, coordinated the reports. The agency considered its labor data, \"without a doubt, MB's most important statistical survey on th e deployment of indi- viduals,\" as a key senior MB official later express ed it. \"For all participating offices,\" the MB officer emphasized, \"this was the major tool for the coordi- nation and surveillance of work employment in the i ndividual territories and in the entire Reich. Its results laid the foundatio n for the ongoing monthly negotiations on the assignment of workers for armam ents production.\" 27 Three years later, Schotte, while in his New York o ffice, would describe"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"to a government official exactly how the personnel tracking system worked in Nazi-occupied territories. \"For example,\" wrote the official that Schotte briefed, \"if a Gauleiter [the ranking regional Nazi Party official] in Poland needs a number of technicians who speak Polish but are not Poles, it is possi- ble to secure the exact names and locations of the men in their present units by placing the punched cards in the sorting machine and setting the machine to provide the correct answer. When the required nu mber has been deter- mined, the machine stops.\" 28 People weren't all that IBM counted and tracked. Sc hotte, in his spring 1940 memo to IBM, was also proud of the company's a bility to count \"ani- mals: a record of each horse, mule, etc.\" 29 Although mentioned by Schotte only in passing, anim al censuses were complex logistical projects. The Nazis ordered the first such \"horse census\" in Poland in early 1940. Jews operated many of the stables and equine opera- tions in Poland. As part of the confiscation of Jew ish assets, horses were seized and then mobilized by the army to move mater ials, prisoners, and even corpse wagons through the frigid, often snowbo und Polish countryside, as well as the cities. By seizing horses, the Reich also cut off an important means of escape for Jews fleeing Nazi invaders. Ord ers to German police units stationed throughout Poland reflected the gra vity of the horse count. Those instructions proclaimed: \"In order to secure the Wehrmacht's census of horses, conducted to avoid a secret shifting around , I request that you, in conjunction with the county's farmers and all Wehrm acht offices dealing with the horse census, employ police forces, especially at night, to establish that horses are not secretly moved from their census dis tricts into other sections. Captured horses which may have been moved are to be confiscated and their owners punished.\" British intelligence agents monit oring the horse census called the project \"tremendous,\" and in a secret re port could only marvel at the \"thoroughness of preparations.\" 30 The spring 1940 cow census in occupied Belgium, als o monitored by British intelligence, reflected an equal feat of li vestock counting. After the count, each animal was required to wear an identity card. 31 Schotte's spring 1940 memo also listed the extraord inary programs of material control covering inventories as diverse as \"arms, clothes, airplane spare parts\" and all raw materials, such as \"rubber , oil, steel, iron.\" Moreover, reported Schotte's report, \"records [are] kept of e ach factory with the type and class of its machines\" and whether they were cu rrently being used for battle or classed as potential suppliers. 32 In occupied lands, material censuses and registrati ons organized Nazi"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"plunder of resources. For example, a butter census was scheduled for occu- pied Denmark to discover large stores of butter hoa rded by Danes. As rail- road cars loaded with the material and merchandise of a foreign country entered Germany, punch cards kept track of the inve ntory. This system was refined as the months progressed and as Germany's o ccupation broadened. Schotte later described the evolved system for a go vernment official who summarized it this way: \"The original inventory thr oughout a country is rep- resented by cards,\" the official wrote. \"For a peri od of ten days in Germany, cards are punched of incoming and outgoing movement s and then at the end of ten days are sorted by commodity, together with the inventory card . . . [so] the inventory is never more than ten days behi nd time.\" 33 Schotte's spring 1940 memo also cited the organizat ion of all \"automo- bile records: (military and in some cases also the private cars).\" Private vehi- cles were routinely seized by invading Germans, fir st from Jews, and then from other citizens as well. Identifying cars and trucks was one of the first statistical efforts Germany generally mounted after invading an y foreign territory. 34 Hollerith machines were deeply involved in combat r ecords as well, according to Schotte's spring 1940 memo. For exampl e, Luftwaffe missions were all duly recorded to calculate the details of aviator combat, asserted the report. Schotte's memo bragged that punch cards mai ntained a \"record of each flight of a military aviator, for his personal record and calculation of premiums.\" In addition, all German war injuries wer e analyzed by complex Hollerith programs that allowed Reich planners at t he Central Archive for War Medicine in Berlin to conduct sophisticated med ical research. In World War I, it was Hollerith analyses of head-wound inju ries that helped the Aus- trian military design the most protective helmet po ssible. 35 Schotte's spring 1940 report also listed \"decoding\" of enemy dispatches as a prime Hollerith application. 36 As each month advanced, Hollerith machines became m ore involved in each and every move of the German forces. Eventu ally, every Nazi com- bat order, bullet, and troop movement was tracked o n an IBM punch card system. 37 In 1940, IBM NY knew the exact location of its mach ines in the Reich on an updated basis. Without that tracking, it coul d not audit IBM Europe's charges and depreciate its equipment. One typical m achine list in its Manhat- tan office was entitled \"International Business Mac hines Corp. New York\" and labeled in German words \"Machines as of Septemb er 30, 1940.\" This particular thirteen-page inventory identified each machine by client, location, type, serial number, and value. Five alphabetizes i n the 405 model series, for"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"instance, were located at the German Army High Comm and. Those five machines bore serial numbers 10161, 10209, 11316, 1 3126, and 13128, with each one valued between RM 8,750 and RM 11.675. 38 Other alphabetizers were placed at a myriad of offi ces, according to the list, including various military inspectorates, off ices of the punch card control agency, the census bureau, the branches of Reich St atistical Office, and strategic arms manufacturers such as Krupp and Junk ers Aircraft. Again, each installation reflected the type of machine, serial number, and value. 39 Ironically, all the rush orders placed into the mil itaries of such countries as Holland and Poland worked to the Reich's advanta ge. When the Nazis invaded, all Hollerith machines were seized and con verted to German use. IBM subsidiaries were then on hand to service the R eich's needs. Sales to Germany's enemies never bothered IBM's hypersensiti ve Reich sponsors. Indeed, some in the Nazi hierarchy may have even vi ewed such sales as a vir- tual \"pre-positioning\" of equipment in neighboring nations, nations that many throughout Europe and America expected to be i nvaded imminently. In the case of Poland, for example, IBM leased Holl erith equipment to the Polish military in 1939 just before the German inva sion, and then immedi- ately after the invasion created a new Berlin-based subsidiary for the occu- pied territory. Accounts in annexed regions were tr ansferred to Dehomag. In the case of Holland, systems were leased to the mil itary in early 1940; a com- pletely new subsidiary was planned in March 1940, j ust weeks before the invasion, and rush-formalized just after the invasi on. 40 IBM had almost single-handedly brought modern warfa re into the information age. Through its persistent, aggressive , unfaltering efforts, IBM virtually put the \"blitz\" in the krieg for Nazi Ger many. Simply put, IBM orga- nized the organizers of Hitler's war. Keeping corporate distance in the face of the compa ny's mounting involvement was now more imperative than ever. Alth ough deniability was constructed with enough care to last for decades, t he undeniable fact was that either IBM NY or its European headquarters in Geneva or its individual subsidiaries, depending upon the year and locale, m aintained intimate knowledge of each and every application wielded by Nazis. This knowledge was inherendy revealed by an omnipresent paper trai l: the cards themselves. IBM—and only IBM—printed all the cards. Billions of them. Since Herman Hollerith invented his tabulators at t he close of the nine- teenth century, the feisty inventor had fought cont inuous technologic and legal battles to ensure that no source but his comp any could print a card compatible with the sorter's complex mechanisms. On ce a customer invested"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"in a Hollerith machine, the customer was continuous ly tied to the company for punch cards. This exclusivity was nothing less than the anchor of the lucrative Hollerith monopoly. 41 Watson vigilantly continued Hollerith's legacy. Dur ing the Hitler years, the Department of Justice litigated IBM's monopoly, focusing on the firm's secret pacts with other potential manufacturers, wh ich forbid any competi- tion in punch card supply. Unique presses, extraord inary paper, near clinical storage, exacting specifications, and special permi ssion from Watson were required for any IBM subsidiary to even begin print ing cards anywhere in the world. Should any non-IBM entity dare enter the field, Watson would shut them down with court orders. For example, when the German paper manufacturer Euler, associated with the Powers Comp any, tried to print IBM-compatible punch cards, Watson restrained them with an injunction. For good measure, IBM wrote special clauses into it s German contracts pro- h i b i t i n g any client—whether an ordinary insurance c ompany or the NSDAP itself—from utilizing any card other than one produ ced by IBM. In short, Hollerith cards could only be printed at IBM-owned and -operated printing facilities and nowhere else. 42 Until 1935, IBM NY was the sole exporter of punch c ards to Hitler's Germany. Eventually, Watson invested in high-speed presses for Germany so Dehomag could print and export its own throughout E urope. During the next few years, he authorized IBM printing presses in Austria, Poland, Hol- land, France, and greatly expanded capacity in Germ any. Deep into the war, as late as 1942 additional IBM printing facilities were opened in Finland and Denmark. All these plants acted as a coordinated cr oss-border European sup- ply line. For example, in the first three months of 1939 alone, IBM Sweden sold 1.9 million punch cards to Denmark, 1.3 millio n to Finland, and 696,000 to Norway. IBM NY sold 1 million cards to Yugoslavi a and 700,000 to Fascist Spain. Dehomag sold 261,000 to Hungary. It was all done under the constant supervision of IBM Geneva, which in turn kept in co ntinuous contact with IBM NY. European General Manager Schotte regularly flew back and forth from Switzerland to America conveying reports. 43 IBM printed billions of its electrically sensitive cards each year for its European customers. But every order was different. Each set was meticu- lously designed not only for the singular client, b ut for the client's specific assignments. The design work was not a rote procedu re, but an intense col- laboration. It began with a protracted investigatio n of the precise data needs of the project, as well as the people, items, or se rvices being tabulated.

Different data gathering and card layouts were required for each t ype of application. 44 Once the problem was intimately understood, Holleri th technology was carefully wedded to the specific mission. This proc ess required a constant back and forth between the IBM subsidiary's technic al staff and client user as they jointly designed mock-up punch cards to be compatible with the reg- istration forms, and then ensured that the plug and dial tabulators could be configured to extract the information. Only after c areful approval by both IBM technicians and the client did the cards finall y go to press. 45 Once printed, each set of custom-designed punch car ds bore its own distinctive look for its highly specialized purpose . Each set was printed with its own job-specific layout, with columns arrayed i n custom-tailored configu- rations and then preprinted with unique column labe ls. Only IBM presses manufactured these cards, column by column, with th e preprinted field topic: race, nationality, concentration camp, metal drums, combat wounds to leg, train departure vs. train arrival, type of horse, b ank account, wages owed, property owed, physical racial features possessed—a d infinitum. 46 Cards printed for one task could never be used for another. Factory pay- roll accounting cards, for example, could not be ut ilized by the SS in its on- going program of checking family backgrounds for ra cial features. Differences in the cards were obvious. Dehomag's 1942 accountin g cards for the Bohler- werk Company, for instance, featured the manufactur er's name centered. The card contained only 14 columns preprinted with such headings as hours worked above, column 8, pieces produced above colum n 9, and suggested processing time above column 11. The right hand thi rd of the punch card was empty: 47 In contrast, SS Race Office punch cards, printed by Dehomag that same year, featured a bold Rassenamt SS logo. Rasse namt cards carried custom- labeled columns ior years of marriage above column 7, height above column 47, height while seated above column 48, and weight above column 49. A sepa- rate grouping on the Rassenamt card listed \"ethnic categories,\" including sub- divisions such as Nordic printed above column 50, O riental above column 57, Mongolian above column 59, and Negroid above column 60. SS Race Office cards were crowded from margin to margin with colum n designations. 48 Dehomag's 1933 Prussian census cards featured a lar ge Prussian Statis- tical Office label and used only 48 columns in tota l. The census card bore such preprinted demographic headings as religion ov er column 24 and mother tongue over column 28; columns 49-60 were le ft empty. Coal survey cards listed sources, grades, and carloads. Luftwaf fe cards listed bombing"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"runs by pilots. Ghettoization registration cards li sted Jews block by block. Railroad punch cards listed cities along a route, s chedule information, and the freight being hauled—whatever that freight migh t be. 49 Each card bore the distinctive ownership imprimatur of the IBM sub- sidiary as well as the year and month of issue, pri nted in tiny letters— generally red—along the short edge of the card. An IBM punch card could only be used once. After a period of months, the ga rgantuan stacks of processed cards were routinely destroyed. Billions more were needed each year by the Greater Reich and its Axis allies, requ iring a sophisticated logisti- cal network of IBM authorized pulp mills, paper sup pliers, and stock trans- port. Sales revenue for the lucrative supply of car ds was continuously funneled to IBM via various modalities, including i ts Geneva nexus. 50 Slave labor cards were particularly complex on-goin g projects. The Reich was constandy changing map borders and German izing city and regional names. Its labor needs became more and mor e demanding. This type of punch card operation required numerous hand written mock-ups and regular revisions. For example, MB Projects 3090 an d 3091 tracking slave labor involved several mock-up cards, each clearly imprinted with Deho- mag's name along the edge. Written in hand on a typ ical sample was the pro- ject assignment: \"work deployment of POWs and priso ners according to business branches.\" Toward the left, a column was h and-labeled \"number of employed during the month\" next to another column h and-marked \"number of employed at month's end.\" The center and right-hand column headings were each scribbled in: French, Belgium, British, Yugosl avian, Polish. 51 Another card in the series was entitled \"registrati on of male and female workers and employees.\" Hand-scribbled column headi ngs itemized such con- quered territory as Bialystok [Poland], Netherlands , Protectorate [Czechoslo- vakia], and Croatia. Noted in pen near the bottom w ere special instructions about the left-hand row: \"columns 56-59 members of Polish ethnicity go with hole 1 \"and \"columns 56-59 members of Ukrainian eth nicity go with hole 2.\" 52 Yet another Dehomag mock-up card in MB Project 3090 was hand- titled \"registration of male and female foreign w orkers and employees.\"'The scrawled column headings included: road worker, min ers, textile workers, con- struction workers, chemists, technicians. 53 Cards were only the beginning. All decisions about precisely which col- umn and which row could be punched in order to prop erly record, tabulate, and sort any portion of data were studiously determ ined in advance by Hollerith engineers. Making the cards readable by I BM sorters required spe- cial settings on the machines that only company eng ineers could adjust. This"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"involved review of machine schematics to ascertain which adjustments were needed for each data run. Once an assignment was un dertaken, the sub- sidiary or its authorized local dealers would then continuously train the Nazi or other personnel involved to use the equipment, w hether puncher, sorter, or tabulator. The delicate machines, easily nudged out of whack by their con- stant syncopation, were serviced on-site, generally monthly, whether that site was in the registration center at Mauthausen concen tration camp, the SS offices at Dachau, or the census bureau in any coun try. 54 Without this abun- dance of precision planning, assistance, and supply of systems, IBM's Hol- leriths just could not work—nor could their benefit s be derived. Naturally, IBM profits boomed. In February 1940, IB M Geneva sent IBM NY a month-by-month review of Dehomag's record profit increases in the last half of 1939. June profits increased RM 96 ,680 over May profits. July bettered June's amount by RM 123,015. August contin ued to set another record, beating July by RM 98,006, and so on for th e rest of the year. 55 In April, IBM executives in both Geneva and New Yor k continued to marvel at Dehomag's unprecedented profit increases, including the unex- pected nearly RM 1.8 million boost in December 1939 . Auditors could not wait for details, reporting, \"we telegraphed to Ber lin for further information which we are now awaiting.\" 56 It was never clear exacdy how much true profit IBM earned worldwide because of the stealthy way its many subsidiaries c lassified and reclassified revenues to avoid taxation. Not all that was profit able was declared a profit. However, in mid-1940, even after applying its best accountancy transmogrifi- cations, the New York office was compelled to annou nce yet another in a string of profit records, this one for the first ha lf of the year. Just less than a $6 million gross profit for the six-month period wa s conceded, and that was without adding about a million-dollar foreign profi t blocked in Germany and elsewhere. That $6 million half-year profit was abo ut a half million higher than the same period a year before. Few in the fina ncial community were sur- prised. IBM profits had been in a steep climb since the day Hitler came to power. 57 Clearly, the war was good to IBM coffers. Indeed, in many ways the war seemed an ideal financ ial opportunity to Watson. Like many, he fully expected Germany to tra mple over all of Europe, creating a new economic order, one in which IBM wou ld rule the data domain. Like many, Watson expected that America would stay out of the war, and when it was over, businessmen like him would pick up the post-war economic pieces. In fact, Watson began planning for the post-war boo m and a complete reorganization of the world's economic system almos t as soon as the war"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"began. By late April 1940, he had convened a stella r Committee for Eco- nomic Reconstruction j o i n t l y sponsored by the two o rganizations he domi- nated, the ICC and the Carnegie Endowment for Peace . This group planned to rewrite the rules of international trade and eco nomic sovereignty, essen- tially parceling out the world's resources when the war concluded. Watson introduced the plan to his fellow industrialists at tending an April 29, 1940, ICC dinner in Washington D.C. \"Our program,\" assert ed Watson, \"is for national committees in the individual countries to study their own problems from the standpoint of what they need from other co untries and what they have to furnish other countries.\" It was the same H itleresque message Wat- son had been preaching for years. Some countries, b oth men believed, were simply entided to the natural resources of another. War could be avoided by ceding these materials in advance. 58 No time was wasted in making plans. \"We are carryin g on just as though there wasn't any war, if you can believe it, and pr obably you don't,\" declared Eliot Wadsworth, chairman of the ICC's American Com mittee, when he con- vened the April 29, 1940, meeting. Wadsworth, a Wat son confidant, revealed that \"already two meetings have been held among rep resentatives of the sec- tions of the International Chamber in spite of the fact that it is contradictory to th regulations of the belligerent countries. . . . England, France and Ger- many have allowed the representatives of their sect ions to meet in friendly discussion at The Hague to consider the ... future program.\" 59 Just days after the ICC's dinner, Hitler launched h is savage Blitzkrieg invasions overrunning Luxembourg, Holland, and Belg ium. An outraged public could turn nowhere without seeing German atr ocities depicted on newsreel screens or the front pages of newspapers. Horror stories from refugees, governments-in-exile, diplomats, and jour nalists alike would not stop. Although the nation was divided on the wisdom of entering the war, many nonetheless felt certain America would soon jo in the battle against Germany. Anti-Nazi sentiment intensified. A Gallup poll taken shortly after the Reich's spring offensive began showed only 2 pe rcent of Americans felt Hitler's invasion of Belgium or Holland could be ju stified. 60 As the public mood swelled against all things Nazi, Watson was now confronted with one major public relations problem: his medal. Despite all the persecutions, atrocities, plunder, and invasions, Watson remained the proud holder of der Fuhrer's Merit Cro ss of the German Eagle with Star bestowed in 1937 at the ICC Congress in B erlin. Hitler's medal was a very public link. Holding it in the face of daily aggression was inherently an acceptance of Hitler's actions."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"At the same time, Watson had avoided virtually all criticism of the Hitler regime beyond offering boyish aphorisms to observe the Golden Rule, and calling the invasion of Poland \"a difference of opi nion.\" He could not afford to offend his second-biggest customer, a customer t hat would soon emerge as the new dictatorial ruler of Europe. On the othe r hand, Watson would never allow his legendary and patriotic position in the United States to be compromised. Events were squeezing Watson. On May 16, 1940, the day after Holland capitulated, Watson did as he always did: he reached out to his friends in the Wh ite House and State Department for political cover. That day, he dispat ched a note to Secretary of State Cordell Hull asking if the United States gove rnment wanted him to return the medal. Watson could then attribute his r eturn or refusal to return the decoration to Hull's specific counsel. Now, how ever, the American gov- ernment was openly anti-Nazi. 61 Hull would not even become involved. The Secretary immediately wrote back: \"I feel that this is a matter upon whic h the decision will have to rest entirely with you, and is not one upon whic h this Government would be able to take a position.\" Hull penned a personal regret in the margin, \"I would offer advice to no person sooner than you. \" 62 Four days later, on May 24, Watson took his first o vert step of identifica- tion with the victims of Nazi aggression. He agreed to chair an emergency committee to raise $3 million for the relief of Dut ch refugees. 63 But now, IBM itself was coming under scrutiny for i ts Nazi connections. The company had become a virtual way station for Ge rman nationals transit- ing in and out of New York for training, meetings, and conferences. Some of these men were now moving with the vanguard of the German destruction machine in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hol land. Others had been transferred to South America. A number of German na tionals were actually stationed at IBM offices in the United States. Some of them were openly anti- Semitic and pro-Nazi. To even express pro-Nazi opin ions was now consid- ered anti-American. 64 Beyond the vaunted publicity stunts and symphonies , IBM's Nazi alliance was quietly emerging from the h aze. At the end of May 1940, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoove r became inter- ested in IBM's Nazi connections. Suspecting the com pany of hosting a hot- bed of Nazi agitation, the Federal Bureau of Invest igation, in late May, launched wide-ranging investigations on at least fo ur German nationals employed by IBM and suspected of espionage or other subversive conduct. Although no charges were ever brought, more probes would follow and they"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"would continue for years. Assistant Secretary of St ate Adolf Berle became the State Department's point man fo r espionage concer ns at IBM. Berle and Hoover began to regularly trade information on the suspected spies at IBM. In short order, federal agents and local police int elligence officers were dis- patched to IBM offices in Manhattan, Endicott, Alba ny, Cincinnati, and Mil- waukee asking probative questions. 65 Eventually, the FBI interviewed senior company exec utives in their IBM offices, including the executive secretary, sal es manager, education de- partment director, and even Executive Vice Presiden t and General Manager Frederick Nichol. The field investigations soon cam e to the door of several IBM clients. Customers were asked about any pro-Naz i remarks overheard from at least one suspect IBM salesman in Milwaukee . The postmaster in Darien, Connecticut, was asked about rumors involvi ng a leading IBM tech- nical editor, a German national working in New York who was said to be part of an anti-Jewish society and expressing pro-Reich feelings. 66 As soon as Watson learned of the FBI's interest, in deed even before the agency could organize its investigations, he went i nto action. Watson and Nichol visited Undersecretary of State Sumner Welle s on June 6 to volunteer personal details about potentially suspect IBM empl oyees in the U.S. and Latin America. Watson made it clear he would cooper ate in any way, and take immediate steps to sever corporate relations with a ny individual the govern- ment thought questionable, including several specif ically discussed in the Colombia and Mexico City offices. Welles referred t he information Watson proffered to Berle, who in turn forwarded it on to J. Edgar Hoover. Ironi- cally, when Watson and Nichol met with Welles at th e State Department on June 6, the two IBM executives forgot to mention on e particular salesman by the name of Karl Georg Ruthe. 67 The FBI soon took an intense interest in German-bor n Ruthe for the many reports of his rabidly pro-Hitler statements w hile in IBM offices and even at customer sites. One widely distributed FBI file memo related the comments of an auditor at Blatz Brewery in Milwauke e, one of the IBM cus- tomers Ruthe had visited. A Blatz auditor passed on Ruthe's remarks report- edly expressing \"strong sympathies for Germany and [the] thought that Hitler was justified in everything he did, inasmuch as Germany was given a very unfair deal in the last World War.\" 68 Another FBI report quoted IBM's Milwaukee manager r eporting that Ruthe \"was quite boastful and would predict the out come of the batdes that are taking place in Europe, and that he kept the of fice force in a general tur- moil with his constant talk about Hitler and what h e [Hitler] was going to do"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"to the European nations.\" Ruthe was also rumored in FBI files to be a mem- ber of the Bund, an association of German-American Nazis. 69 Few could understand Ruthe's continuing position in the company since he was hired in 1936. He did not fit the IBM mold. Reported in FBI files as a \"drunk\" and \"a poor salesman,\" Ruthe was said to have seriously under-performed at the Endicott sales training scho ol. Indeed, when Ruthe was transferred from the New York office to IBM Mil waukee, his superior were asked to keep tabs on him. 70 Although Watson and Nichol forgot to mention Ruthe during their June 6 discussion, they did remember several days l ater, when Nichol sent a letter to Welles marked \"Stricdy Confidential.\" Nic hol wrote, \"In the discus- sion which Mr. Watson and I had with you on Thursda y June 6, we over- looked mentioning the name of Mr. Karl Georg Ruthe. The facts concerning him are as follows.\" Nichol then listed in a column Ruthe's date and place of birth in Germany, graduating school in Germany, the four languages he spoke, home address, and citizen status—which was \" American Citizen.\" 71 Nichol added some other background: \"Mr. Ruthe was first employed by us on December 1, 1936, in New York in a sales c apacity. He spent three months at our school at Endicott, N.Y., from July t o October 1937, when he was assigned to Milwaukee, still in a sales capacit y. Prior to working for us, Mr. Ruthe was a tutor of modern languages in New Yo rk City; had his own school in Schenectady (the Schenectady School of La nguages) and was an instructor of German at Union College in Schenectad y. We understand him to be an American citizen, and believe that his par ents reside in Germany. It so happens that we saw fit to ask for this man's re signation last week, based solely, however, on his inability to produce a reco rd as a salesman in this business.\" Nichol included nothing more on Ruthe. 72 Ironically, when the FBI inquired as to how a perso n such as Ruthe could remain at IBM so long, they discovered that W atson had omitted some pertinent details. The FBI file cited observations received from IBM Sales Manager Fred Farwell: \"Subject's work was so poor,\" an FBI report recorded, \"that he would have never been allowed to finish th e IBM School and go out into the Field as a salesman had it not been for hi s close relationship to Mr. Watson, President of IBM; that as a matter of fact, Subject had been a con- stant source of trouble to all men in administrativ e positions who came in contact with Subject. And that Subject was only kep t as an employee for the length of time, in view of his relationship to the President of the Company.\" Farwell added that Ruthe had married Watson's niece . 73 "},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"The first week of June was a tense one for Watson. On June 3, 200 Ger- man planes dropped 1,060 explosive bombs and 61 inc endiaries on Paris itself. More than 97 buildings were struck, includi ng two hospitals and ten schools, killing 45. Ten children died at one demol ished school alone. U.S. Ambassador to France William Bullitt himself narrow ly missed death. While he was lunching with the French Air Minister, a bom b crashed through the roof and into the dining room, showering everyone w ith glass shards, but the device failed to explode. 74 The public mood was reflected in a page one story i n the New York Times, June 4, reporting a mere off-hand comment to an elevator boy by a German diplomat arriving in Buenos Aires, Argentina . The diplomat asked if the young man could speak German. When the youth re plied that he could not, the diplomat shot back, \"Well, you'd better le arn it, you are going to need it.\" 75 On June 6, newspapers across the country, including the New York Times, reliably reported that the Gestapo was scour ing Amsterdam armed with special lists of the \"enemies of Germany.\" Tho se rounded up were \"liq- uidated. . . . Nearly all have faced firing squads, \" the syndicated articles reported. Rumors that the names and addresses of al l Jews living in Holland had already been turned over to Nazi agents were al so circulating in both German and American papers. That same day, some 2,0 00 German tanks began rolling toward Paris for what was being calle d the \"Battle of France.\" Reich bombers hit the British coasdine. All this wa s happening on the very day Watson was in Washington, D.C., assuring Unders ecretary of State Welles that IBM would rid itself of Nazi sympathizers. 76 The long delayed moment had come. That day, June 6, Watson wrote a reluctant letter to Adolf Hitler. This one would no t be misaddressed or undelivered. This one would be sent by registered m ail and released to the newspapers. Watson returned the medal Hitler had pe rsonally granted—and he chose to return it publicly via the media. The l etter declared: \"the present policies of your government are contrary to the cau ses for which I have been working and for which I received the decoration.\" 77 In Germany, Watson's action would be considered the highest form of insult to der Fuhrer at a moment of German glory. T he public manner of Wat- son's rejection only heightened the affront. This w ould change everything. In Berlin, at Dehomag, all hell broke loose."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"9 THE DEHOMAG REVOLT JUNE 10, 194O Memo to Willy Heidinger Re: Mr. Watson I am setting up a confidential file in this matter ...

This stu pid step of Mr. Watson's opens up a number of possibili ties. At the moment, we have decided not to start anything o urselves but will wait to see who might approach us, if anyb ody. It is not improbable that such a step may harm the compan y, and all of us, very seriously—sooner or later—since it must be considered as an insult to the Fiihrer and therefor e the Ger- man people. Mr. Hummel has been deliberating whether we can eve n continue in the management of the Dehomag in light of this deliberate insult.... I have assumed the position t hat our first duty and obligation is to place all our stren gth at the disposal of this enterprise which is so important f or the con- duct of the war. It is imperative that this company meet all the tasks that the German economy has imposed on it , par- ticularly in time of war. Moreover, there is no rea son to cause 218"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"the Dehomag and its employees any harm merely becau se of the per- sonal hatefulness and stupidity of one American. It appears that Mr. Watson is surrounding himself w ith a group of Jews who fled from Europe.. . . It appears that the i nfluence of these Jews, in addition to the anti-German Jewish and oth er lies in news- papers, are beginning to affect his mind and to imp ede his judgment. Even if he [Watson] should have pretended friendshi p for Germany and if his true opinion did not become apparent unt il now, it is evident that this act is terribly inane, looking at it from a purely commercial point of view. It seems Mr. Watson, with great vani ty, wants to insult the Fiihrer of the German people, but he does not r ealize that there can only be one result of this act, if there is any at all, namely, that Mr. Watson's personal economic interests can be aff ected. Nevertheless this step is indicative of the great e xcitement in Amer- ica; therefore the danger that America may enter th e war is somewhat closer. If this should happen we would have to exam ine the possibility of separating ourselves from [IBM] America in view of the new condi- tions. Naturally the Economics Ministry will examin e carefully whether Germany receives more royalties from America or vic e versa.... we would welcome it if the royalty agreement between D ehomag and IBM could be dissolved entirely. One could assume the p osition that the mutual contributions should stop with an exchange o f patents.... Therefore, if we renounce any further contributions [from IBM NY], no royalties should have to be paid in the future. The IBM interest in the Dehomag would then have to be transferred into German hands in some form or other.... Savings of royalties could b e paid into a war fund and at a future time the rentals could be lowe red to correspond to the present royalty. In any case I have the feeling that Mr. Watson is s awing the branch on which he and his IBM are sitting. From Hermann Rottke 1 The war was on. Nazism's favorite capitalist had fallen from the Re ich's imagined cloud line. By returning the medal, Watson had turned on der Fuhrer, insulted the German people, and proved that IBM was no longer a reliable ally of the Third Reich. Everywhere among the insider echelons of Nazidom and Ger- man media, Watson's name was reviled. Hitler's pers onal paper, Volkischer"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Beobachter, declared that the \"vultures of profit s mell the fry,\" adding with regret, \"it might have been expected that . . . Tho mas Watson would have a broader outlook than the hate-blinded Jewish editor s and journalists.\" 2 Nazi castigation was not limited to the Greater Rei ch, but was broadcast by German radio and newspapers in the invaded count ries as well. Quickly, IBM managers in occupied Czechoslovakia, Poland, No rway, and other Nazi- dominated lands learned of Watson's affront. They f elt the impact immedi- ately as their German customers, corporate and gove rnment, expressed displeasure. Fascists in other Axis countries were equally offended. Mus- solini's people in Rome were furious with Watson It aliana, summoning the subsidiary's director to a formal reproach. 3 All the suppressed but long festering resentment at Dehomag now coa- lesced into a unified list of grievances. Dehomag w as a German company that Watson stole. IBM NY represented foreign domination and therefore the very antithesis of National Socialist doctrine. The American parent company was charging exorbitant royalties and reaping huge profits, thereby exploit- ing the German nation. Most of all, Heidinger hated Watson. It all became a single impetus for open corporate rebellion. The backlash was immediate. In Dehomag's Lichterfel de office, Wat- son's picture was removed from the wall. Stuttgart employees did the same. In the Hamburg, Frankfurt, and Vienna branches—and ultimately in every one of the German subsidiary's offices—the pictures of Watson were quickly taken down. 4 That was only the beginning. Spurred by equal parts personal greed and Nazi ferv or, Heidinger and Rottke began scheming to completely eliminate IBM N Y's influence from Dehomag's realm. Step-by-step, they would now press ure IBM either to sell the subsidiary to German nationals, or at least red uce the foreign ownership from a majority to a minority. Ousting his personal representatives from the Berlin subsidiary's board of directors would al so end Watson's micro- management of Dehomag operations. Plain and simple: Heidinger, Rottke, and Hummel now saw Thomas J. Watson and IBM NY as l ittle more than a foreign nemesis—a nemesis they were determined to c ast off. To begin his putsch, Heidinger retreated into a pre cise reading of Ger- man corporate law. On July 1, 1940, he sent a regis tered letter to IBM Geneva convening a special board meeting to discuss the crisis caused by Watson's insult to Hitler and to expel IBM NY's rep resentative, Geneva- based John Holt, from the three-seat board. 5 Using charged language, the meeting agenda declared that Holt would be \"eliminated\" by a vote of the local board becaus e he was an absentee"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"director and thereby \"prevented from fulfilling his obligations.\" IBM re- sponded to the challenge with coolness. Geneva cabl ed a power of attorney to IBM's local representative, Albert Zimmermann, auth orizing him to discuss the issue, of course, but then to vote IBM NY's majorit y against replacing Holt. 6 Insufficient, declared Heidinger. Under a strict re ading of German cor- porate law, a power of attorney required a certain sworn written form, and an authorizing cable alone was legally unacceptable. O n July 15, Heidinger con- vened a brief sixty-minute board meeting, disallowi ng Zimmermann's dis- senting proxy. Then the two resident board members, Heidinger and his brother-in-law, Dr. Gustav Vogt, voted Holt out. \"A ll persons present agree that it is advisable to straighten matters,\" the re bellious German board resolved by \"the elimination from the board of dire ctors of Mr. Holt. . . . Considering the present situation ... all persons p resent propose a personality [as a replacement] who is also esteemed by the Germ an [authorities].\" Tech- nically, however, with Zimmermann's proxy disqualif ied, a voting quorum was not present. Therefore, while Holt could be vot ed out by the board alone, his replacement could not be properly voted in under German law except by the stockholders themselves. IBM was the largest, holding 85 percent. 7 Knowing Watson's proclivity for hiring lawyers to d efend hairsplitting legal positions, Dehomag adhered to the explicit le tter of the law. Heidinger sheduled another immediate meeting, just two weeks later, on July 29, to elect the \"replacement of the eliminated member, Mr . Holt,\" as the board minutes phrased it. Under German corporate law, the minutes noted, if IBM declined to provide a proper written proxy for the second meeting, then the token minority 15 percent ownership—that is, Heidin ger, Rottke, and Hummel—could vote in whomever they wished to replac e Holt. 8 Doing so would neutralize Watson. Just after the July 15 meeting adjourned, a brusque Dehomag letter was dispatched to IBM Geneva. Citing German law and company statute down to the sub-paragraph, Dehomag's notice advised Geneva that its previ- ous cabled proxy to Zimmermann was unacceptable in its form. With or without the approval of IBM NY, the letter blundy w arned, the re-scheduled July 29 meeting would address the Watson medal cris is \"and its eventual consequences for our company,\" as well as the \"repl acement of the elimi- nated member, Mr. Holt.\" 9 For years, cabled instructions from Geneva and New York projecting Watson's micro-management had been routine facts of corporate life for Dehomag. But all that was before Watson returned th e decoration. Now Hei-"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"dinger had the momentum to work his own will. He wo uld force his issues with a combination of strict legal interpretation and rapid-fire corporate maneuvers. Heidinger's July 15 correspondence to IBM Geneva wa rned the parent company that should it fail to provide the proper p roxy form for the July 29 meeting, or fail to ratify Berlin's choice for a ne w board member, a stalemate would prove just as destructive. Then, \"no decision s binding the company can be taken,\" Heidinger warned, adding, \"To enligh ten matters, we wish to state that according to ... [German corporate] law, the board of directors has to be composed of three persons at least.\" 10 Holt's ouster left only two sitting board members: Heidinger and his brother-in-law Vog t. Without three on Dehomag's board, the firm would be illegitimate and incapable of function- ing as a corporate entity. To ensure that Watson could not litigate the board putsch as setting \"unreasonable\" deadlines in view of difficult warti me circumstances, Hei- dinger scheduled the July 29 meeting not in Dehomag 's Berlin headquarters, but in the subsidiary's Munich branch. Munich was m uch closer to IBM's Geneva office, \"thus diminishing your traveling tim e,\" Heidinger carefully wrote to IBM Geneva. 11 This time, IBM rushed to comply. Watson's Geneva re presentatives did not feel comfortable entering Germany with official s agitated. But they did present their resident German agent, Zimmermann, wi th a proper power of attorney. The July 29 board meeting in Munich conve ned at 10 A.M. with a reading of the rules and relevant statutes. Quickly , they did away with the traditional balance sheets showing losses resulting in zero bonuses. Hei- dinger forced adoption of the true profits totals: nearly RM 2.4 million for 1938 and almost RM 4 million for 1939. Management b onuses of nearly RM 400,000 were approved for Rottke and Hummel. Heidin ger reserved his own bonus for later. 12 The medal crisis was then vigorously debated \"in vi ew of the great urgency of this question.\" Heidinger demanded that Holt's seat on the board be filled not by one German director, but two. He n ominated Emil Ziegler on the suggestion of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce . The second nomina- tion was a leading Nazi official, Ernst Schulte-Str athaus, a key advisor in Deputy Fuhrer Rudolf Hess' office. 13 Dehomag was to become completely Nazified. The hier archy had plans for Hollerith machines that stretched to virtually all the Reich's most urgent needs, from the conflict in Europe to Hitler's war against European Jewry. Some of the plans were so sensitive they could not be discussed with out-"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"siders. It was absolutely essential that Dehomag be controlled by the highest Nazi party and government circles. Heidinger had co nnections at those lev- els, which had benefited Dehomag through the Hitler years. Heidinger had been a friend of Hess' since their so ldiering days in World War I. The Schulte-Strathaus family had, in 1 910, helped Heidinger lauch the original Hollerith Company in Germany. Bo nds remained tight durin g the post-War years. Ernst Schulte-Strathaus had emerged as one of the bizarre and mysterious personalities at the top of the Nazi leadership. A doctrinaire astrologer, Schulte-Strathaus read the stars for Hess. 14 In the July 29 board meeting, Heidinger demanded th at Schulte- Strata u s be ratified. In fact, Heidinger had alread y invited him to join the board and Schulte-Strathaus had already accepted. 15 So he expected a unan- imous yes. But Watson was not ready to allow Heidinger to dict ate who could sit on the board—even if the proposed man was a persona l advisor to Deputy Fuhrer Hess. Zimmermann declared that he was instru cted to vote against Schulte-Strathaus. Wielding IBM's majority, the mea sure was defeated. Wat- son preferred either Rottke or Hummel, both of whom owned token stock options, or Zimmermann himself. Heidinger staunchly refused to even allow Watson's suggestions to be voted, asserting that Ge rman corporate law made employees ineligible for seats on a board of direct ors. Heidinger insisted on Schulte-Strathaus as a representative of Hess. 16 Heidinger adjourned the meeting in a stalemate. Nex t, he decided to either cash out of the company, or pressure IBM int o essentially walking away from its subsidiary. The stakes were immense f or Germany. Hess' office was not the only one determined to ens ure the complete cooperation of Dehomag. Other key Party advisors to der Fuhrer's office, soon to emerge, also had plans for IBM's equipment. But the strategic alliance with IBM was too entrenched to simply swit ch off. Since the birth of the Third Reich, Germany had automated virtually it s entire economy, as well as most government operations and Nazi Party a ctivities, using a single technology: Hollerith. Elaborate data operations we re in full swing every- where in Germany and its conquered lands. The count ry suddenly discov- ered its own vulnerable over-dependence on IBM mach inery. Millions of cards each week were needed to run the sorters. Indeed, the military alone employed some 30,000 people in their Hollerith services. Adding other governmental and commercial clients, a t any given time, thou- sands of operators were working at Holleriths. Wats on presses printed all the cards these people needed moment to moment. IBM's p aper and pulp supply"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"lines extended to mills throughout the world. IBM o wned the patents for the unique paper stock the Holleriths required. At the same time, Germany's war industry suffered from a chronic paper and pulp sho rtage due to a lack of supply and the diversion of basic pulping ingredien ts to war propellants. Only four specialized paper plants in Germany could even produce Hollerith card stock—all were on contract to IBM. The few pap er houses in France were running low on coal and cellulose supplies, he nce their deliveries could never be assured for more than a month or two at a time. IBM was con- standy pooling its global paper resources, includin g its abundant North American suppliers, to meet the ever-increasing dem and. The Reich could not tap into the vital North American paper markets . Holleriths could not function without IBM's unique paper. Watson control led the paper. 17 Printing cards was a stop-start process that under optimal conditions yielded 65,000 cards per eight-hour shift. The Thir d Reich consumed cards at an almost fantastic rate. In 1938, more than 600 million per year were con- sumed from German sources alone. In 1939, that numb er almost doubled to 1.118 billion. Projected use by 1943 was 1.5 billio n just within the Reich. Building a printing press was a six-month process a t best, much longer when the metals were not available. Dehomag clients typi cally stockpiled a mere thirty-day supply of finished punch card paper. Hol leriths could not function without cards. Watson controlled the cards. 18 Precision maintenance was needed monthly on the sen sitive gears, tum- blers, and cogs on thousands of machines that synco pated millions of times each week throughout Nazi Europe. Building new fact ories might take six months to a year just for the first machine tools t o arrive from specialized machine tool works. Long tool manufacturing lead ti mes were always needed. In 1937, IBM ordered three inclinable power presses for planned factory expansion; delivery times for the power pre sses required ten or eleven months. Three six-spindle drill presses requ ired eight to twelve months. A three-spindle drill required sixteen mont hs. A radial arm drill required twelve months. Two plain milling machines and a vertical miller required twenty-four months. Even working at peak c apacity in tandem with recently opened IBM factories in Germany, Austria, Italy, and France, Nazi requests for sorters, tabulators, and collators wer e back-ordered twenty-four months. Hollerith systems could not function withou t machines or spare parts. Watson controlled the machines and the spare parts. 19 Watson's monopoly could be replaced—but it would ta ke years. Even if the Reich confiscated every IBM printing plant i n Nazi-dominated Europe, and seized every machine, within months the cards a nd spare parts would"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"run out. The whole data system would quickly grind to a halt. As it stood in summer 1941, the IBM enterprise in Nazi Germany was hardly a stand- alone operation; it depended upon the global financ ial, technical, and ma- terial support of IBM NY and i t s seventy worldwide subsidiaries. Watson controlled all of it. Without punch card technology, Nazi Germany would b e completely incapable of even a fraction of the automation it h ad taken for granted, Returning to manual methods was unthinkable. The Ra ce and Settlement Office of the SS was typical of those Nazi agencies frustrated over their long- back-ordered Holleriths. The Race and Setdement Off ice was a marginal agency that functioned as a marriage-assistance bur eau for SS officers, and therefore did not merit its own Hollerith. While it was waiting, Race and Set- tlement department heads complained in one typical statistical report that the office simply could not keep up with its prodig ious raceology responsibil- ities without a punch card system. \"At least 7,000 applicants,\" the report con- ceded, \"who fulfilled the [racial] requirements f or marriage have been waiting years for their Certificates of Approval fr om the Reichsfuhrer-SS.\" What's more, 50,000 additional applicants were also waiting for further doc- umentation reviews, the report continued, and more than 100,000 applicants had only been provisionally accepted into the SS un til the office could prop- erly \"complete their family trees back to 1800.\" 20 \"I have determined,\" wrote the SS Race and Setdemen t Office's statisti- cal chief, \"that the Hollerith punch card system, w hich is being used success- fully by the Reich Statistics Office, Reichsbahn, R eichspost, Reichsbank, etc, as well as various research facilities . . . is necessar y and would serve our inter- ests best.\" 21 The Race and Setdement statistical chief succincdy explained the Hollerith difference in these words: \"The [manual] way in which the files are [currently] stored, makes any quick and efficient s urvey impossible. It would require months of work looking through individual f iles to answer even one [racial] question.\" He added, \"For every single one of the additional future tasks, months of tedious clerical work would be nec essary just to determine how many and which [racial] petitions are involved. The punch card system would be able to determine this easily, quickly to the desired date.... There- fore, card indexing is indispensable.\" The SS stati stician concluded that the high cost of the IBM equipment was justified becaus e this was the \"exact instrument for complete surveillance both on a larg e scale and down to the smallest detail.\" 22 The SS Race and Settlement Office was finally alloc ated its Hollerith,"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"but only in 1943, two and a half years after inaugu rating the collection of the marriage data it sought to automate. 23 With punch card technology so vital to German opera tions, it was no wonder that after Watson ostentatiously returned Hi tler's medal, Reich plan- ners suddenly worried about their entire Hollerith infrastructure. B e r l i n launched the same struggle for autarky, that is, na tional self-sufficiency, already underway for armaments and raw materials, s uch as rubber. Out- raged Nazi leaders became determined to replace IBM technology with a punch card system they could control. It was a matt er of Nazi necessity. It was a matter of Nazi pride. The quiet effort began in France, which had fallen to German domina- tion in mid-June, just days after Watson returned t he medal. Nazi engineer and Dehomag-trained punch card specialists from Ber lin quickly began pilfering the machines of IBM's French subsidiary, bringing them back to Germany for urgent assignments. No longer bound to honor Watson as a business partner, Reich agents categorized the mach ines as \"war booty\" that could simply be seized. 24 Next, Hermann Goering's circle purchased a majority control of the tiny Powers operation in France, hoping to merge it into a Germanized cartel. Nazi representatives even brought in for examinatio n a rival machine pro- duced by a small fledgling French company called Bu ll, which enjoyed about 25 percent of the fragmented French market. Plans w ere already underway to purchase a majority control of Bull, which had wiel ded no mass manufactur- ing operation but offered a replicable design. Wats on had long tried to neu- tralize the tiny Bull operation with patent litigat ion, buy-out offers, employee raids, and even outright purchases of Bull's operat ions in Switzerland. But Bull, even though dwarfed by IBM, still had a numbe r of machines in opera- tion. And its machinery was considered as good as a ny Hollerith. 25 But Berlin really didn't know what to do. They stol e some IBM machines in France, purchased control of a Powers s ubsidiary, and brought in Bull machines, all envisioning a new cartel. Non e of it was coordinated, but something had to be done to counteract Germany' s dependence on IBM. From the Reich's point of view, Watson and IBM clea rly possessed an insider's understanding of virtually everything Ger many did and indeed all of its advance planning. That had to stop. Argue as they might, IBM NY officials were unable to convince Nazi officials ot herwise, even when New York emphasized that only non-American IBM employee s possessed access to the Reich's most sensitive secrets. Watson's Ber lin attorney, Heinrich Albert, offered a written opinion summing up the pr oblem. \"The military"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"authorities are greatly concerned with the whole ma tter,\" wrote Albert shortly after the Dehomag revolt began. \"Not only a re most military agencies and offices equipped with these special machines bu t the authorities are also afraid that via the majority of IBM in the Dehomag, the USA [itself] might get a far-reaching insight into the activities not only of Dehomag itself, but also of the big German rearmament plants and the Ge rman economic struc- ture as a whole. This fear is based on the particul ar organization of the busi- ness of Dehomag and is not quite as unfounded as it might appear from the very beginning. 26 \"The Dehomag does not sell its machines,\" Albert co ntinued, \"but lets them out on lease. Before concluding a contract of lease, a thorough study of the [client] company, or business enterprise wh ich wants to have the machines, is made from the point of view whether th e use of the machines fits into the system of the prospect, whether the u se of them is advantageous, and how the business must be organized to use the m achines to the greatest possible advantage. There can be no doubt that this method . . . secures to the Dehomag a contact and insight into the big busi ness of the nation supe- rior to any other company.\" 27 Albert added that IBM's counterarguments and ration ales were simply not credible to the authorities. \"It is no use to a rgue that this fear is absolutely theoretical and has no foundation [in fa ct] whatever in practice, as not only no American citizen is employed in this pa rt of the business ... [or that] these studies are kept most confidential and secret according to the strictest general rules and regulations. There the objection and the handicap is and must be taken into consideration.\" 28 From IBM's point of view, the struggle to create an alliance with Nazi Germany had been too great and the potential for co ntinuing profits too rewarding to simply walk away. Nor would Watson tol erate competitors— existing or newly created—invading IBM's hard won t erritory. Since the dusty horse-and-buggy days of National Cash Registe r, Watson had learned not to compete, but to eliminate all competition—no matter how marginal— by any pernicious tactics necessary. IBM Geneva troubleshooter, P. Taylor, in an August 1940 letter to the New York headquarters, worried openly about the thr eat should the Third Reich develop Bull machines or an ersatz hybrid—eve n though it would take years to switch. \"The danger of this is, of course, that the Bull machines do exactly the same as Dehomag's,\" wrote Taylor, \"whil st also having alphabetic and printing units, and [if obtained] they can easi ly be exchanged to replace Dehomag machines.\" 29 "},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Heidinger had obtained a one-week travel permit and on August 15, 1940, he visited Taylorin IBM's Geneva office to lodge his threats and demands. He was not subtle. 30 \"Foreign partnerships in German companies are not v ery much liked,\" Heidinger told Taylor, \"particularly where the fore ign interest is a majority. The IBM majority in the Dehomag was not very helpfu l, but did not cause too much harm—up to now. The situation is entirely changed by the step of Mr. Watson giving back his German decoration and wr iting a letter to the Fuhrer published in the American press. That step i s considered as an insult of the highest degree not only to Hitler, but to ea ch individual German. What could be the consequences? Each customer or pr ospect will try to avoid getting punched card machines from a company which proved or at least appears to be hostile to Germany. Therefore a n already existing or a new-formed German company taking up the manufacture and sale of such machines will have excellent chances. Dehomag's bus iness would no longer exist.\" 31 Exaggerating how easy it would be for any new compe titor to emerge, Heidinger asserted, \"Patent difficulties do not exi st [and] if necessary it would be easy to get a compulsory license for a mod est royalty of say five percent instead of twenty five percent which [now] Dehomag pays [to IBM NY]. No difficulties would exist to get experts for such a system: workmen, engineers, salesmen, managers.\" 32 Heidinger threatened to call for a vote of employee s as loyal Germans, whether they would continue working with an IBM sub sidiary or a newly formed German one. \"The IBM should consider what re sult a vote within Dehomag would have,\" said Heidinger menacingly. \"Wh o of the Dehomag people is willing to continue working for the Dehom ag of which a majority is owned by a hostile IBM or who is willing to work for a new German company?\" 33 There were more complications. All the open undercu rrents against Dehomag as an American business with German managem ent were now con- firmed. IBM's subsidiary had been unmasked as a non -Aryan business— something many always knew but begrudgingly overloo ked. Now many in Berlin were preparing for the day when the U.S. wou ld join England against the Third Reich. In such a case, explained Heidinge r, Dehomag would be considered enemy property, a custodian would be app ointed to run the busi- ness and make all decisions. \"Such [a] trustee woul d be the only manager,\" continued Heidinger, \"while the rights of the old m anagers and the board are suspended. The consequences would be disastrous . One of the several"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"possibilities is.. . [that] the trustee would disco ver that our profit and there- fore the prices are too high. He certainly could an d probably would reduce at once the prices. There would practically be no p ossibility to raise the prices again in normal times. Supposing the Dehomag pulled through this crisis—the return to shareholders could then only b e very modest. 34 \"With or without the entry of the U.S.A. into the w ar,\" stressed Hei- dinger, \"the danger of the total ruin of the Dehoma g is immediately present. No member of the board of directors or management c ould assume the responsibility of passively awaiting events.\" 35 Heidinger offered IBM several ultimata. One: sell t he entire subsidiary to the Germans at a negotiated price. Two: use the millions of surplus profits in Dehomag's blocked accounts to double investment in the subsidiary. Issue new shares, but all the new voting rights would be held by Germans, either Dehomag managers or an Aryan committee. IBM would s till retain its major- ity ownership, but lose its control. Three: In a co mplicated scheme, IBM NY buys out some of the captive stock held by Heidinge r, Rottke, and Hummel and transfers that stock to employees. 36 Whatever Watson decided, insisted Heidinger, Dehoma g must now be allowed to exercise further control. \"The advice I give you now is of more value than any advice given in the past,\" Heidinger told Taylor. But he would not wait for the protracted decision-making process Watson was known for. He demanded that Taylor cable the threats and optio ns to Watson. Heidinger would wait in Geneva for an immediate response. 37 Taylor cabled Heidinger's remarks to New York with his observation that \"a plan exists already for the formation of a new [rival] German com- pany.\" 38 Whatever Watson did now to enrich its local manage rs or relinquish control, eventually IBM would be dethroned. At the same time, IBM people understood it was far easier to talk about replacin g IBM than to actually do so. Harrison K. Chauncey, Watson's top emissary in Berlin, reported after one key meeting with a ranking Nazi official, \"We are t hreatened with possible elimination of Dehomag through competition which ma y be sponsored by the authorities.\" But he followed by countering, \"T he government at the pre- sent time needs our machines. The army is using the m evidendy for every conceivable purpose.\" He added, \"During the war it would be very difficult for competition to get started, unless they used th e French Bull manufac- turing plant.\" W. C. Lier, another senior IBM audit or negotiating in Berlin, commented on the prospect of Germany not allocating raw materials for machines manufactured by IBM's subsidiary in occupi ed France. Lier wrote to Chauncey, \"the whole point is—who will manufactu re since the Dehomag"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"is not in a position to deliver most of the units b efore one or even two years?\" Lier underlined his rhetorical question, ad ding, \"[who] will produce the machines which are indispensable to the German war economy?\" 39 Since 1933, Watson had refused all opportunities to restrain or disasso- ciate from Dehomag, or even reduce IBM's breakneck expansion program for the Third Reich. Yet now, in August 1940, as ne ver before, Watson was confronted with one genuine last chance—perhap s the most decisive chance—to walk away. If Watson allowed the Reich—in a fit of rage over t he return of the medal—to oust IBM technologic supremacy in Nazi Ger many, and if he allowed Berlin to embark upon its own ersatz punch card industry, Hitler's data automation program might speed toward self-des truction. No one could predict how drastically every Reich undertaking wou ld be affected. But clearly, the blitz IBM attached to the German krieg would eventually be sub- tracted if not severely lessened. All Watson had to do was give up Dehomag as the Nazis demanded. If IBM did not have a techno logic stranglehold over Germany, the Nazis would not be negotiating, they w ould simply seize what- ever they wanted. For Watson, it was a choice. He instructed IBM General Manager F. W Nichol to te lephone Geneva manager P. Taylor on August 19 and enthusiastically approve the ratification of Hess' staff advisor Schulte-Strathaus and German businessman Emil Ziegler as new board members. Watson also agreed to offer former German counsel in New York, Otto Kiep, as a third addition . Watson had known and trusted Kiep as a family friend for years; Watson's daughter even served as godmother to Kiep's child. Kiep could at least try to mitigate further Deho- mag efforts to exclude IBM NY from the business pro ceeds and help shore up ties to the government. At the August 31 Dehomag board meeting in Berlin, under direct instruction from the New York office, IBM's representa- tive voted with Heidinger. The details were recorde d in the minutes. \"Mr. Holt is barred by unanimous vote. Messers. Kiep, Sc hulte-Strathaus and Ziegler are elected unanimously.\" 40 But Watson would not detach Dehomag from the global IBM empire. He would not allow Bull and Powers or any other com petitor to intrude upon his domain. IBM would not back down from what it considered its rightful commercial place in Nazi Germany's New Wor ld Order. Over the coming months, Watson would fight hour to hour, deploying lawyers, special emissaries, and government interme diaries to protect his privileged and profitable position in Hitler's ente rprise. Watson would not"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"allow IBM to be replaced. As a result, millions of cards, millions of lives, and millions of dollars would now intersect at the whir ring stations of Hitler's Holleriths. EVEN THOUGH Watson had agreed to director's seats for three inf luential Nazis—Schulte-Strathaus, Ziegler, and Kiep—it just wasn't enough. The pressure on IBM's empire would not subside. On Augu st 20, a special com- mitee of some undetermined Nazi authority launched an investigation of Dehomag and its practices. There was no let-up on H eidinger's insistence that IBM relinquish control of Dehomag either by be coming a minority owner or selling outright. If that was not possible , he wanted his now valu- able shares purchased by IBM for dollars. 41 At first, the fact that Heidinger was insisting on both a buy-back of his shares and transfer of the subsidiary ownership app eared to be a contradic- tion. If Heidinger wanted as much of the stock as p ossible in German hands, why insist on IBM repurchasing his shares, which wo uld return ownership to New York? But Watson soon understood: Heidinger was trying to cash out his position in dollars even while he helped German circles dismantle Deho- mag or weave the firm's resources into a purely Ger man cartel. This was becoming all too apparent to Watson's negotiators a s they explored any avenue to quiedy separate from Heidinger. 42 In late August 1940, Taylor in Geneva suggested New York might want to simply pay off Heidinger with an enticing financ ial arrangement by either increasing his percentage of the company or underta king a one-time buy-out of some or all of his shares on the condition that he cancel his special con- tract altogether. Knowing Watson's aversion to payi ng actual dollars, Taylor suggested IBM trade \"one of our buildings in Berlin ,\" and add in more accounting maneuvers. \"If we have to pay in Reichsm arks,\" wrote Taylor, \"get Mr. Heidinger to take the first building at our pur chase price of 2,178,000 marks, plus the difference in a cash payment, such cash to be obtained from Dehomag as a payment on account of their indebtedne ss to us for royal- ties.\" To keep Heidinger out of any competitive com pany, Taylor suggested IBM \"would continue to pay 40,000 marks a year to H eidinger for his advi- sory services, and in the event of his death, pay i t to his widow as long as she lives.\" 43 Pages and pages of financial and political analyses shot back and forth between IBM offices in Berlin, Geneva, and New York . It was a constant state"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"of corporate crisis as the vicissitudes of one opti on after another were floated and sunk, revived, and then shunted. 44 Through it all, Heidinger remained adamant. IBM's Berlin attorney, Heinrich Albert, was one of Germany's leading experts on foreign corporations operating in the Th ird Reich. Of course, IBM was not alone in its lucrative dealings with the Th ird Reich. Many American companies in the armament financial, and service ar ena refused to walk away from the extraordinary profits obtainable from trad ing with a pariah s t a t e such as Nazi Germany. Indeed, Watson led them in hi s capacity as chairman of the American section of the International Chambe r of Commerce. Albert counseled many of these American companies about pr otecting their sub- sidiaries. Based on his experience, Albert sent Wat son dozens of pages of dense legal opinions, settlement theories, and caut iously parsed recom- mendations. But much of it built on one of his earl iest observations: \"It can- not be denied that the situation is serious,\" wrote Albert. \"What it practically amounts to is the question whether the IBM prefers to hold a secure and safe minority interest in a sound and safe company, [or] . . . the holding of a controlling, but endangered majority in an endanger ed company.\" 45 The prevailing view among many was that Nazi aggres sion in Europe was unstoppable and the economy that would soon be imposed over an entire subjugated Continent would flow only to thos e companies Berlin favored. Owning even a minority of that new dominan t Dehomag could be vasdy more valuable than the Dehomag IBM owned toda y. Albert empha- sized that in the very near future, \"a minority of shares might be even materi- ally of higher value than the present majority.\" He added that the notion of stockholder \"control\" was actually becoming a passe notion in Germany since the Reich now direcdy or indirectly controlle d virtually all business. \"A majority of shares,\" he wrote Watson, \"does not mean as much as it used to . . . [since] a corporation, company, enterprise or plant manufacturing in Germany is so firmly, thoroughly and definitely sub jected to the governmen- tal rules and regulations.\" 46 Clearly, it was not possible to continue doing business as a German company without becoming a vir tual extension of the Reich war economy. That had been the reality for ye ars. Whether IBM reduced its control to a minority or re tained its majority, or appointed any number of influential Nazis to its board or management staff, was immaterial to Germany's perception of IB M's subsidiary. The truth was now known. Dehomag could no longer continue und er its former Aryan guise. \"Neither public opinion nor the authorities, \" assured Albert, \"would recognize the German character of the company [any longer].\" 47 "},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Watson tried a number of compromises to redeem hims elf in German eyes. None of them worked. He offered a sizable don ation to the German Red Cross. Rottke immediately wrote a letter to Gen eva stating that the gift would never be accepted. Watson's hope that the fur or would die down was unrealistic. Although the decoration was returned o n June 6, Nazis were still roiling months later. German radio in neutral Swede n in mid-September declared Watson persona non grata, assuring he woul d never again be per- mitted to set foot in any territory controlled by G ermany. 48 Watson understood that unless he came to an accommo dation with Germany, Dehomag was only the beginning. IBM operat ed profitable Deho- mag-dominated subsidiaries in Italy, Poland, Czecho slovakia, Holland, Bel- gium, Romania, France, Sweden, and indeed almost ev erywhere in Europe. All of them could be targeted. At about 11 P.M. on September 30, 1940, Taylor in G eneva telephoned IBM's New York headquarters with continuing reports about pressure against IBM subsidiaries in the wake of Watson retu rning his medal. Should America enter the war, Taylor asserted, one of the first subsidiaries to be placed under a German trustee would be Watson Norsk , the IBM operation in occupied Norway. Earlier, Taylor's office had se nt several letters explaining how the seizure would work under just-espoused Germ an military law. To allow the subsidiary to continue even after Amer ica might declare war, Taylor now suggested creating the appearance that W atson Norsk had been sold to Norwegians even though IBM NY would still o wn and control all aspects of the firm. \"We should consider whether no w is not the time,\" Taylor said, \"to take the necessary action to make the com pany free from American interests. We have come to the conclusion to sugges t that the royalty set-up should be considered, that the shareholders would b e changed to avoid American holders.\" As it stood, IBM's name was not now listed as controlling the Norwegian firm. Norwegian records reflected fou r individuals as owners: IBM managers Holt and Milner, as well as two token Norwegians. But the two Americans were clearly IBM Geneva employees kno wn to Dehomag. So Taylor offered a new list of reliable Norwegians to use as additional front men. He emphasized, \"The shares of these [new] peop le should be in their name actually, and cash consideration given. Unders tood,\" he added, \"they would be held for the IBM—but no rights.\" The stock transfers could be just a pen stroke away, he pointed out, because \"th e shares are in New York now.\" 49 What's more, Taylor recommended, Watson Norsk's 400 ,000 Krone debt to IBM NY should be reduced on paper to furthe r distance the sub-"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"sidiary from American control. If a series of pap er transactions involving 250,000 Krone were arranged as Taylor outlined, the n the \"estimated loss for 1940 is 75,000 Krone, plus a cash remittance in New York of 100,000 Krone, After deducting all those from the IBM account, [it ] leaves a balance of approximately 100,000 Krone, which we think would b e in order.\" 50 IBM's European empire, primarily vested in Dehomag, appeared to IBM managers to be careening toward demise. If the company did survive its challenges, German custodians would confiscate it a s enemy property as soon as America joined the war. Unlike his managers , however, \"Watson did not fear seizure by a German-appointed trustee. He actually preferred it. A peculiarity of German law demarcated a strong dis tinction between the assets of racial inferiors such as Jews, Poles, Czechs, and other vanquished groups, and the property of what in the bizarre Naz i mindset constituted a genuine war adversary, such as Britain and the Unit ed States. If the U.S. en- tered the war, Germany did not believe it would occ upy American territory, only defeat the country. During any war, Germany ex pected its commercial enterprises in America to be safeguarded, managed p roperly by a trustee, and then returned intact when the conflict ended. In th at same spirit, the Third Reich would in turn safeguard, manage diligently, a nd return American en- terprises. Germany's well-developed alien custody l aws were still in effect. 51 So while Nazi Germany was voraciously plundering an d pillaging the width and breadth of Europe, a profoundly different set o f rules would apply to IBM and other \"enemy property\" seized in any of tho se occupied countries. Watson understood the ironic benefits of German ene my trusteeship. Just a few years earlier, he fondly remembered his own experiences in a let- ter to Hjalmar Schacht, president of the Reichsbank . \"From the day I returned to Germany after the [first world] war\" wrote Watso n, \"to find my company's affairs in the best safekeeping by your Alien Prope rty Custodian, well admin- istered and conscientiously managed . . . I have felt a deep personal concern over Germany's fate and a growing attachment to the many Germans with whom I gained contact at home and abroad.\" 52 Taylor's memos, citing military decrees regarding t he potential for seizure, explained that during the years any alien corporation was under Nazi receivership, all the profits would be safely block ed in an account. \"We pre- sume,\" wrote Taylor in a mid-September 1940 letter, \"any resulting income is for the benefit of the owner in enemy territory and may be paid over at the end of the hostilities in accordance with the payme nt of enemy debts in gen- eral.\" Taylor sent exact translations of the law to New York for Watson's study. 53 "},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Watson queried attorney Albert. Albert confirmed th at the rules of re- ceivership had not changed. In a detailed memo, Al bert unambiguously reported back: \"A custodianship of the Alien Proper ty Custodian would by itself mean no special danger, as the law concernin g the administration of enemy property, and the practice based on this law, are very conservative, protect the property and keep it alive and in order .\" 54 Because the potential for seizure as enemy property was so encourag- ing, Albert could not help but comment that Watson' s decision on caving in to Heidinger's demands was actually \"all, a matter of [Watson's] tempera- ment, of taste, of general business policy, of the outlook into the future and so on.\" Watson could rely on Albert's assessments. Albert himself had func- tioned as a key custodian of enemy property during World War I. He had dis- tinguished himself as a keen businessman and now re presented those same companies as clients. Enemy receivers in Germany an d other Axis countries understood the potential for a rewarding business r elationship when hostili- ties ended. Ultimately, the Italian enemy property custodian, Giovanni Fagi- oli, actually sent personal written word to Watson that he was prepared to operate the Rome subsidiary profitably. Fagioli onl y hoped he could \"coop- erate with the owners after the war.\" 55 For IBM, war would ironically be more advantageous than existing peace. Under the current state of affairs, IBM's assets we re blocked in Ger- many until the conflict was over. Under an enemy cu stodian, those same marks would still be blocked—again until any war wa s over. As it stood, Hei- dinger was threatening daily to destroy Dehomag unl ess IBM sold or re- duced its ownership; and he was demanding to cash o ut his stock. But if war with the U.S. broke out, Heidinger and the other ma nagers would be sum- marily relieved of their management authority since technically they repre- sented IBM NY. A government custodian chosen on the basis of keen business skills—and Albert might have the connectio ns to select a reliable one—would be appointed to replace Heidinger and man age Dehomag. In fact, the Nazi receiver would diligendy manage all of IBM's European sub- sidiaries. The money would be waiting when the war was over. 56 While the custodian would do all in his power to ru n the company profitably, he would also serve the interests of th e Reich. 57 The custodian would make the hard decisions, probably in tandem w ith IBM Geneva because there were nexus subsidiaries in Sweden, Sw itzerland, and other real or nominal neutrals that were indispensable to Dehomag's supply lines. Other IBM subsidiaries in Latin America, Africa, an d in the colonial lands of"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"conquered European nations would also cooperate wit h Dehomag, but only through the most indirect and purely legal routes. Plausible deniability would be real. Questions—would not be asked by IBM NY. Answers- would not be given by IBMers in Europe or Reich off icials. 58 The revealing records would not be kept in New York but in Europe where they could never be uncovered and examined. T hey would be kept abroad in filing cabinets in subsidiary offices. Ma ny of New York's records from the pre-war years would simply be destroyed. N o one would ever be able to identify exacdy what IBM NY did and did not know about the use of the Hitler Holleriths, or how many IBMers in Europe circuitously shared their information with New York. Indeed, a war-time Justice Department investigator examining IBM's collusion with Nazi Ge rmany wrote: \"IBM is in a class with the Nazis.\" But the investigator was f orced to conclude: \"This is a story told in circumstantial evidence.\" 59 Watson would be satisfied with not knowing the spec ifics held by his European subsidiaries and managers—so long as those subsidiaries tena- ciously pressed the Nazi regimes for proper rent pa yments on each and every machine, on every last one of billions of punch car ds, on every spare cog and plate, and on all maintenance calls, all according to carefully worded con- tracts. Those demands for payment would start with the machines just removed from Paris by Reich officers in August 1940 . 60 Watson's micro-management of the most infinitesimal details would now end. That power would be delegated to trusted s enior managers, man- agers who would be rewarded for their most loyal an d most difficult service with generous salaries, and then anointed with grea t promotions in the pow- erful foreign divisions of the global IBM that they themselves built. Corpo- rate security for these men would be seemingly endl ess. Even their children would find lucrative association with International Business Machines. In the company's literature, they would be remembered as \" heroes.\" 61 The corporate haze would last for decades. With all the European inter- mediaries, ownership nominees, corporate intrigues, belligerent German managers, and Nazi custodians, it would be impossib le to reliably point a finger at the New York office. Hollerith machines c ould be placed in muse- ums in exhibits tying their use to the most heinous aspects of the Third Reich, but the deniability would be unshakable. For , in truth, from 1933 until the summer of 1940, Watson personally micro-m anaged virtually every Dehomag decision. From August 1940, IBM NY made sur e it did not know most of the gruesome details of Hollerith use. It w as better not to know. The company that lionized the word THINK now though t better of its"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"guiding mandate. Incriminating dealings with Nazis did surface from time to time as frustrated war-besieged subsidiary managers would invariably become too specific in the cables to New York. Thes e communications were discarded, however, and if necessary disowned by IB M NY. 62 By placing itself in the dark, IBM could forever truthfully de clare it made millions dur- ing the war without knowing the specifics. An emboldened Watson now decided more than ever to fight back. Immediately after Taylor's September 30 telephone c all warning of German receivership, Watson elected to confront Heidinger head on. To do so, he would need the strongest ally. He knew who to call. Watson contacted the U.S. State Department. IBM HAD BEEN cultivating contacts at the State Department for ye ars, start- ing at the top with Secretary of State Cordell Hull , and, of course, President Franklin D. Roosevelt. But entrenched influence was sought at all levels down to the lowliest clerks and bureaucrats in the Department's technical offices and overseas installations. Indeed, it was these people who rendered the most service. 63 Commercial attaches and officers in the Foreign Ser vice were supposed to assist U.S. business abroad. That has always bee n their charge. But with Watson's widely published letters of greetings, end orsements, and congratu- lations from Hull, the rank and file of the Foreign Service soon learned that Thom a s J. Watson was more than just another citizen , and International Business Machines more than just another American c ompany. Increasingly, diplomats and Foreign Service staffers became only too eager to please the firm and its stellar leader. Eventually, Watson ass umed the status of unofficial ambassador-at-large, or perhaps something even larg er. What was good for IBM became good for the United States. The protecti on and success of IBM was elevated to a defined \"national interest.\" As s uch, IBM subsidiaries around the world learned to use American embassies and consulates as strategic partners in their routine business activi ties. 64 The special relationship started in earnest in late 1936. Just after Wat- son was elected president of the International Cham ber of Commerce, he managed to gain unprecedented levels of official re cognition for the body and his assumption of its helm. Ambassadors, consul s general, and attaches were invited to attend, and IBM made special arrang ements for their passage and hotels. Diplomats and other State Department bu reaucrats were always welcome at the company's door or its lavish events. Watson traded on the"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"perception throughout the Department that he was a personal and influential friend of Hull, and a major donor to Roosevelt. Des ignating who would rep- resent the Department at a Watson event was frequen tly a process handled with great deliberation. A dozen or so memos might circulate back and forth to numerous offices and bureaus as the collective d ecision was carefully rendered. 65 At first, rank and file State Department officers o ffered simple coopera- tion. For example, in fall 1936, the third secretar y of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow conferred regularly with IBM's office there about Soviet govern- ment attempts to break IBM's monopoly. Cooperation was a two-way street. Watson would continuously check his busy travel and social schedule with State officials. In spring 1937, various letters we re exchanged between the White House, the State Department, and Watson over whether he should extend official felicitations to the French governm ent at a commemoration event. 66 After Watson had received the medal from Hitler at the 1937 ICC Berlin Congress, junior officials at the State Depa rtment had begun advocat- ing for IBM's unique business advantage. In particu lar, helping IBM avoid or reduce foreign taxes and tariffs was a continuing e ffort. For example, in August 1937, the U.S. Embassy in Paris helped IBM's French subsidiary gain a better tariff rate. Just days after the Paris Emb assy helped with French cus- toms, IBM sought similar assistance in Czechoslovak ia. Tax authorities in Prague were raising IBM's tariffs. IBM's Foreign Di vision wrote to the Trade Agreement division in Washington, D.C., asking for help \"to induce the [Czech] government to revert to the former classifi cation.\" 67 In some cases, the lower echelons of America's Fore ign Service were eager to curry favor when they succeeded for IBM. I n Bucharest, on Septem- ber 28, 1938, Legation Secretary Frederick Hibbard sent report 543 entitled \"Assistance Given International Business Machines C orporation,\" bragging, \"Mr. Schotte of the Geneva office thanked a member of my staff for assis- tance given the company about a year ago. He stated that following the advice of the Legation, he [Schotte] had been able to prevent a tax suit against the Romanian subsidiary calling for the pay ment of 60 million lei in back taxes and fines.... This item should be added to the list of accomplish- ments of the Legation.\" 68 Lavish letters of praise for individual ambassadors or their attaches were often sent by senior IBM executives to Hull to show gratitude and reward their effort. 69 Watson's almost regal movements in Europe were regu larly followed"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"and reported with the utmost detail by American dip lomats who were always on hand. Watson's v i s i t to Oslo was typical. The U. S. Embassy there quickly reported \"in quintuplicate\" that \"his train was met by a delegation represent- ing the local membership of the International Chamb er and by the Secretary of the Legation. Shortly after reaching the Legatio n, Mr. Watson received the press, responding to questions in a manner which ev oked considerable favorable publicity in the newspapers.\" 70 There seemed to be no limit to the service lower-ec helon State Depart- ment staffers were willing to extend. Indeed, while World War II was raging, one Department administrator found time to write a letter to Frances Munos, an IBM employee in New York, passing along a messag e from a family mem- ber in Santiago, Chile, \"stating that she desires t o have you purchase shoes for her use.\" 71 With as much service as State Department lower-eche lon officers were enthusiastically providing, it is no wonder that Wa tson turned to America's commercial attache in Berlin, Sam Woods, to use the weight of the United States government to help IBM confront Heidinger. W oods was enamored with Watson and only too glad to act as IBM's post- man, openly passing mes- sages across the Atlantic through diplomatic pouch and coded cable, and providing clerical facilities within the embassy. M ore than that, Woods openly draped IBM's negotiation in the mantle of American officialdom that Watson hoped would make the difference. On October 2, 1940, Watson sent a five-page letter to Heidinger's home passed through diplomatic pouch. Not only did Watso n use the convenience of the diplomatic pouch, he took the unusual step o f ostentatiously typing at the top: \"Letter to be transmitted through the cour tesy of the State Depart- ment to Mr. Willy Heidinger, Pocking 56, am Starnbe rger See, Bavaria, Germany.\" 72 Watson began with a cooperative tone. He confirmed, \"On August 19 last, we telephoned our Geneva office to inform you that we would be glad to comply with your request for the election of Mes srs. Schulte-Strathaus, Ziegler and Kiep as directors of Dehomag. We were l ater informed that they were duly elected ... on August 31, 1940.\" He went on, \"It has always been our desire to work in harmony with you for we reali ze how valuable your association with us has been . . . we maintain the highest respect for your judgment.\" He added, \"We thought you were entirely right in the suggestions you made about enlarging the Board of Directors and placing thereon [three] men of affairs.\" 73 At the same time, Watson stressed, questions of Deh omag being threat-"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"ened unless IBM relinquished its majority w a s \"a ma tter of such importance\" that it needed to \"be presented to our fu l l Board o f Directors [in New York] with all the facts obtainable for its careful consi deration.\" He added, \"You must realize that the economic conditions in the wo rld, upset as they are, make it extremely difficult for us to decide prompd y important matters such as you have suggested with respect to our interests in Germany without . . . all available facts and data.\" 74 Specifically, IBM NY wanted to know whether there w as genuinely an attempt to undermine Dehomag—privately or officiall y—in favor of a new company, unless it reduced its ownership and also r epurchased Heidinger's shares. Ironically, as a savvy businessman, Watson understood the deeper fiscal meaning of Heidinger's actions against the s ubsidiary. Days earlier, IBM had confronted Heidinger with a completely unex pected scenario. If Dehomag was actually endangered because of Heidinge r's disloyal actions, then the division's future was in fact worth far le ss. As such, Heidinger's shares were dramatically reduced in value as well. In other words, whatever Heidinger did to undermine Dehomag would impact the very Dehomag share value he was hoping to parlay. Heidinger angr ily rejected this notion. But in his October 2 letter, Watson held fast: \"We do not acquiesce in the statement that affairs of Dehomag following Septemb er 30th have no bearing on share purchases.\" 75 Continuing with a hard line, Watson shocked Heiding er with another technicality. During the last round of corporate fi sticuffs over bonuses, an automatic and generous buy-back was agreed upon. As was so often the case, when the negotiations were all written up, IBM pref erred at the last minute that the final agreement should not be signed, but rather oral. At the time, Dehomag was reporting a continuous multimillion-mar k income stream. Now Heidinger thought that when his shares would be rep urchased, the per share price was a windfall guaranteed by the 1939 oral ag reement. Watson's audi- tors had calculated these shares to be in excess of RM 2.7 million and Hei- dinger asserted they were valued at RM 3.8 million. If compelled to pay in dollars at an adverse exchange rate, as Heidinger e xpected, it would cost IBM millions. 76 Not so, declared Watson in his letter. \"You [Heidin ger] say, 'Regarding the price basis, there is already an agreement betw een me and the IBM. . . . Your reference to an agreement . . . evidently refe rs to the then proposed agreement with Dehomag for the purchase of your sha res, which we, as stock- holders, were willing at that time to vote for.... You did not accept or execute these contracts, and, in view of the fact that the proposed contracts were not"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"executed by you, of course none of their proposed p rovisions now apply.\" 77 In other words, a year alter the contentious settle ment was reached, IBM was now saying that without a signature, it would not h onor the agreement. \"The only binding contract that exists between us,\" concluded Watson, \"is one executed in New York City on the 8th day of May, 1936 . . . [and] executed in Berlin on the 10th day of June, 1936.\" 78 Therefore, assured Watson, negotiation would be nee ded, maybe even a protracted arbitration process. \"Our representati ve will meet you just as soon as he can secure the necessary documents to tr avel,\" he wrote. 79 Mindful that his letter was being presented under t he color of the State Department, Watson emphasized to Heidinger and to a ny colleagues in the Nazi Party he might share it with: \"Our respective countries are at peace with each other, and we feel confident that there is no more desire on the part of the German authorities to interfere with United States business interests than there is a desire on the part of officials in the United States to interfere with business interests of Germany located in this country. . . . We believe that our two countries will continue to deal with e ach other fairly in all busi- ness matters.\" 80 Watson's gambit worked. Heidinger became convinced he had to nego- tiate. At stake was the viability of the German aut omation program. Hei- dinger could not make the decisions alone. He had b een in touch with a secret source in the Nazi Party who was familiar wi th Dehomag and its important uses for the Reich, and was willing to me et with Watson's negotia- for in Berlin. 81 On October 26, 1940, several cars motored to La Gua rdia Field. A dele- gation of senior IBM executives, led by Watson hims elf, accompanied the one man upon whom rested the future of Dehomag and, in fact, IBM's entire European business. The vehicles pulled up to the Pa n Am terminal. There a decorous IBM attorney named Harrison K. Chauncey alighted, ready to board Pan Am's Dixie Clipper to Portugal. A company notice for what was ex- pected to be protracted travel appeared in the empl oyee newsletter. The item was headlined: \"Mr. Chauncey Leaves by Clipper on T rip to Europe for IBM.\" Nothing in the item mentioned visiting Germany. The subhead explained only, \"Member of Legal Staff to Visit Switzerland, Portugal While Abroad.\" 82 In truth, from neutral Lisbon, Chauncey would make his way to wartime Berlin for face-to-face negotiations with the still enraged Nazis. The news- papers that month were filled with terrifying repor ts that would have intimi- dated anyone traveling to the Third Reich. American corporate employees thought to be Jewish were tortured in Romania under Gestapo instruction."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"British bombs hailed onto Berlin. Jews were enterin g the first phases of per- secution in Nazi-dominated Vichy France and being t ragically ghettoized and enslaved elsewhere. Moreover, if Roosevelt declared war, no one could even imagine the fate of Americans trapped in Nazi-contr olled land. 83 Although a loyal employee for thirteen years, begin ning in the company controller's office, Chauncey understood little abo ut the innermost affairs of Dehomag and its spreading influence with other I BM subsidiaries. He couldn't even spell newly elected board member Otto Kiep's name correctly. But Watson was counting on him. So Chauncey said go odbye to his wife and accepted Watson's assignment. Studious and reason ed in his approach, Chauncey's briefcase contained his own private plan of action, labeled \"Pro- gram.\" The ten-page \"Program\" bookishly oudined his challenge in perfect classroom-style Roman numeral and A-B-C format, ste p-by-step: the ques- tions he would ask in Berlin, the tactics he would employ with Heidinger along with their various financial implications, an d how the U.S. Embassy would assist him. In the event IBM was forced to ar bitrate Heidinger's demands, for instance, he planned to claim the busi ness was over-valued because \"the amount of business which may be attrib utable to the war [also means] the present profit rate is not a normal perm anent profit rate.\" 84 To some, Chauncey might have looked like a schoolbo y in a dark suit and tie. He offered a polished, clean-shaven face w ith wide eyes, and ears that stuck out from behind nipped sideburns beneath a closely cropped hair- cut. But he was a sharp, fiercely tenacious attorne y who would pursue his adversaries. He set aside qualms about flying into a dangerous Nazi setting and was completely focused on his historic corporat e mission: save IBM Europe. For his efforts, Watson called him \"the bra vest man in IBM.\" 85 CHAUNCEY ' S PHYSICALLY tiring trip to Germany via Bermuda, Lisbon, and Geneva did not dampen his enthusiasm. His first sto p was Munich where he spent several days in discussions with Heidinger. A t first, Chauncey tried to reason with his sometimes emotional adversary. He t old the embittered Dehomag founder that Watson wanted him to stay on, not force the repurchase of his shares. Mostly, he hoped Heidinger would hel p Watson comprehend the competitive forces that might be arraying again st IBM. But Heidinger was not interested in compromise. Chauncey purchase d a small vase for the Heidingers as a personal gift from Watson. Heidinge r refused it. Most strik- ing to Chauncey was Heidinger's contradictory argum ents, and his elaborate, and occasionally bizarre, air of secrecy. 86 "},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"The main Nazi objection, however was made clear: IB M NY, now proven disloyal, would discover the secret planned uses of the Hollerith machines. Chauncey and his fellow Berlin-based atto rneys did everything they could to constantly repeat the assurance that they would not ask ques- tions or learn details. He told Heidinger he was wi lling \"to go to any officials to show that IBM had not obtained any information o f the confidential mat- ters being done by Dehomag.\" 87 Again, IBM NY made a fine distinction between what its headquarters in New York would dis cover and the day-to- day knowledge its managers, engineers, and servicem en on site would be required to know to do their job. A confusion of unwarranted alarms, false starts, an d sudden rumors surrounded Chauncey as he tried, in his proper lega listic way, to make sense of it all. But after a few days of treadmill progre ss in Munich, Rottke telephoned from Berlin with something that appeared concrete. Rottke, too, was mysterious, but insisted it was imperative that Chauncey come to Berlin at once. 88 When Chauncey arrived in Berlin, the sudden urgency of Rottke's tele- phone call dissipated as quickly as it appeared. As was so often the case in wartime Berlin, whispers and hazy conjecture ruled the day. Chauncey had hoped for a meeting with an influential Nazi. But a s yet, that was not happen- ing. So Chauncey immediately sought out board direc tor Otto Kiep and attorney Albert in Berlin, each of whom offered a d ifferent suggestion for IBM's next move. Chauncey penciled voluminous notes and oudined various stratagems assessing the ifs and what-ifs of the pr edicament. 89 As Chauncey waited to meet with the mysterious Nazi source, he lost no time scheduling a conference with Manager Karl H ummel. Hummel was generally perceived as more helpful in his views to ward IBM because of his warm, personal relationship with Watson. This would be Chauncey's oppor- t u n i t y to learn firsthand the structure of Dehomag' s business in war-ravaged Europe. The conversation with Hummel was frank. Acting more like an attorney conducting a deposition, Chauncey first tried in hi s stiff way to understand the emotional Nazi mindset, why the medal's return was so threatening, and whether Dehomag could weather the rage. C HAUNCEY : When did you first observe difficulties . . . and w hat form did it take? H UMMEL : Sales resistance—before [the] war—because of [the] American ownership. Prior to that some government department s would not do"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"business with us even if they needed the machines, because they claimed [the] confidential nature of [the] department's act ivities prevented doing business with...

C HAUNCEY : After the war commenced, did the difficulties incre ase? H UMMEL : Sure!...

C HAUNCEY : Notwithstanding that the animosity existed against Dehomag? H UMMEL : In view of labor conditions, they could not do othe rwise.

H UMMEL : When Schotte was here the difficulties had not incr eased so much and we did not think . . . it was so very much worse than it had always been ... we always had been accustomed to the sales resistance because we were American owned! 90 Chauncey turned to the issue of Hitler's medal.

Hummel equivocated from mom ent to moment on the prospects. In truth, no one knew in this fluid wartime situation just what Germany's leaders would decide.

When we wanted something we could show that and say: \"You can't refuse.\" With officials and cus tomers it was a good sell- ing point, and when it was returned it had the oppo site effect and worse. 92 Chauncey now methodically reviewed for himself exac dy what business arrangements Dehomag was engaged in throughout Euro pe, country by country. At the time, IBM had devised complicated a nd often circuitous methtods of payment that generally but not always f ollowed a 75-25 percent split of revenues between New York and Dehomag. IBM subsidiaries across Europe would generate orders for equipment, parts, and punch cards. Deho- mag would supply these, either direcdy or through t he subsidiaries it domi- nated in Nazi-conquered territory. IBM NY's 75 perc ent share of the money would sometimes be sent to Geneva, and sometimes to Berlin. Germany would often—but not always—receive its 25 percent s hare by crediting what it owed IBM for spare parts, the so-called \"goods a ccount.\" But all these pay- ment procedures were frequently modified—or even se t aside—as conflict- ing country-by-country wartime regulations emerged. 93 IBM received its money either through Geneva, which openly trans- ferred the sums to New York, or through Dehomag, wh ich blocked the rev- enues until war's end, although they could be used to grow the subsidiary and purchase real estate. 94 Chauncey now wanted to make sure Dehomag was still abiding by the payment procedures as much as possible. C HAUNCEY : Have you ever had any understanding with IBM in Gen eva about the classification of machines for royalties? H UMMEL : We feel obliged to pay on sorters and tabulators. T he Devisenstelle [Foreign Exchange Office] will not permit us to pay royalties on other ma- chines.

Throughout, when referring to other subsid iaries in Nazi-dominated lands, he spoke as few words as possible—often spea king no more than the name of the invaded country. Not once in the long q uestioning of Hummel"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"did Chauncey ever ask what the machines were being used for. Nor did Hummel offer any details. In dozens of pages of not es, reports, and messages sent from Chauncey to New York and back, the questi on never came up. No one wanted to discuss it. SECRECY , CONFUSION , and crisis continued to surround Chauncey's negotia - tions throughout November and December 1940 as he a nd IBM attorneys in Germany conferred with various influential personal ities in the business community, German military, and Nazi Party. The ten sion was building as some, including Chauncey, began fearing for their s afety. 96 IBM attorney Albert had created a nine-page legal o pinion with staunch recommendations. In his written opinion, Al bert openly conceded that most German military agencies relied upon IBM machinery, and that the Reich was rightly worried that IBM knew the details of secret projects. The Reich's fear, Albert later wrote, \"is not quite as unfounded as it might appear,\" based on the intimate knowledge Dehomag en gineers required to crate and service Hollerith punch card systems. He added, \"It is no use to argue that this fear is absolutely theoretical.\" No netheless, Albert urged Wat- son to resist efforts to force IBM to relinquish it s majority ownership. 97 Chauncey was originally going to cable Albert's sup portive opinion to New York, together with a six-page personal report. But at the last minute, he retreated to the Embassy, \"for my own protection,\" where he typed his letter. \"It is important,\" warned Chauncey, \"that any reply you send me be sent in code and no reference made to this communication wh atsoever.\" He added that he had shared its contents with no one except the Embassy staff. Embassy people in turn made copies for review by se nior officials of the State Department in Washington, D.C., before they i n turn delivered the cor- respondence to IBM. Albert's nine-page opinion itself was undated. Chau ncey was to destroy it after reading. But with the assistance of the Em bassy, Chauncey elected to send it to Watson anyway, by diplomatic courier, wr iting, \"Dr. Albert's [opin- ion] is contained in the enclosed memorandum, which I am sending to you, notwithstanding that I am supposed to return it to him for destruction.\" Before enclosing it, Chauncey, for extra measure, r emoved the first page of the opinion, which undoubtedly included identifying letterhead from Albert's law office. Chauncey shared his worry: \"Ou r people must report their conversations with me, and in some respects t hey may be under the instruction of the military authorities.\" 98 "},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"But writing from the security of the Embassy, Chaun cey's own report freely outlined what was at stake for I B M NY in ret aining its strategic alliance with Nazi Germany. He described the vast f inancial promise of the Third Reich where \"plans are laid for the great eco nomic future of Germany. One of the creeds here is 'Europe for Europeans,' a nd this probably means 'Europe for Germans.'\" 99 His report to IBM NY continued, \"Naturally everyone here has no doubt about how the war will end, and they build on that. . . . consequently, they vision Dehomag doing business everywhere in Europe, and under the guid- ance of the new economic order in Europe, Dehomag w ould grow tremen- dously because all countries would use machines as Germany now does.... I suppose they [are] right.\" Chauncey added the conve rse: even \"if Germany loses the war, [and] these things will not come int o being . . . American- owned companies could probably resume business as t heretofore.\" 100 Clearly, Chauncey contended, the Nazis now understo od that IBM's technology was vital to their war aims and too entr enched to be discarded. Replacing Holleriths, he argued, would be a long, d ifficult task in view of the military's \"large use of Dehomag machines.\" Indeed, despite all \"the animos- ity,\" Chauncey wrote, \"the business has, however, g one forward . . . due to the need of the authorities.\" 101 In fact, Germany had already thought better of its first hostile anti- Watson reaction and was trying now to find some rap prochement with the IBM Corporation. As for the machines snatched by th e Nazis in France, noted Chauncey, \"I understand . . . rental is being paid for them to our French company.\" 102 IBM should rely on its decided technologic edge, su ggested Chauncey, because of the profound difficulty in starting a pu nch card industry from scratch, especially if New York could block French Bull competition. In spite of the quality of its devices, French Bull was a ve ry small company with very few machines. Bull's one small factory could never supply the Reich's conti- nental needs. Ramping up for volume production—even if based within a Bull factory—would take months. Hitler didn't have months in his hour-to- hour struggle to dominate Europe. In a section enti ded \"Length of Time for Competition to Come in Actuality,\" Chauncey argued, \"Unless the authori- ties, or the new company, operate in the meantime f rom the French Bull fac- tory, it would appear that much time may elapse bef ore such new company [could] ... furnish machines in Germany.\" 103 \"Watson, in fact, was ready to continue fighting to keep Bull out of the Nazi market. IBM had already preemptively acquired Swiss Bull's patent"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"rights in Switzerland and was preparing to litigate to block the French sister corporation from functioning. I B M had concluded Bul l infringed several IBM-owned patents, now that IBM NY had acquired Swi ss Bull, which legally controlled French Bull's patents. Moreover, IBM believed that French Bull's use of an 80-column punch card violated IBM patents and could be swiftly enjoined by court action. So Chauncey added his prediction that even if French Bull did attempt to cooperate with the Na zis, there would be a great \"length of time and difficulties for actual c ompetition\" to appear. 104 It seemed that in spite of its autarkic impulses an d collective rage against Watson, the cold fact remained: Nazi German y needed punch cards. It needed them not next month or even next week. It needed them every hour of every day in every place. Only IBM could pr ovide them. \"My inclination is to fight,\" Chauncey declared str aight out. But the battle would be difficult. He knew that IBM was fig hting a two-front psycho- economic war: Heidinger's demand to cash in his sto ck, and Nazi Party demands to take over the subsidiary. Clearly, the t wo were organically linked, but Chauncey could not be sure how. 105 As they bickered, war and invasion proved it was st ill good business. By now, Dehomag's profits had mushroomed even more rapidly than expected, especially as a result of the Nazi takeov ers of Belgium, Poland, and France. As the Reich expanded its voracious need fo r Holleriths in occupied lands, Dehomag's value was catapulting daily. The l atest valuation of Hei- dinger's 10 percent stock, Chauncey advised, was no w as much as RM 23 mi l l i o n —IBM accountants in Germany had already conf irmed it. The new figure was as much as ten times higher than calcula ted just a few months earlier. It would be an enormous amount of money if payable in dollars— perhaps $5 or $6 million. Chauncey expected Heiding er to prevail in any court, should the Germans press his claim for repur chase. IBM's multi- million-mark blocked accounts in Berlin would be se ized by the court to purchase those high-priced dollars, Chauncey warn ed. For this reason, Chauncey was continuously trying to finesse a settl ement. \"I am after him every day,\" he wrote. 106 As for IBM's fight with the Nazi Party, Chauncey re iterated his willing- ness to \"make any representations to the authoritie s that our managers need not reveal any information of the activities of Deh omag's customers... . but I cannot get the actual persons out in the open.\" 107 That chance would now come. After weeks of remaining in the background, D r. Edmund Veesen- mayer would finally come forward."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Even though Edmund Veesenmayer lived at August Stra sse 12 in Lichterfelde, just around the corner from Dehomag's Berlin headqu arters, h e h a d declined to make his presence k n o w n to Chauncey until the first days of December 1940. Veesenmayer was one of Berlin's quiet but pow erful Nazis, often feared, who helped to directly implement the most dramatic phases of Hitler's plans for Europe and the Jews. He was just a step or two remo ved from der Fuhrer, and was from time to time summoned for consultations by Hitler personally—a claim few would dare make, but a claim that was non etheless quite correct. Although Veesenmayer proudly wore the full uniform and regalia of his SS rank, he avoided noisy street riots and ghetto roun dups in favor of boardrooms and embassies. Always lurking in the shadows as Eas tern Europe's most heinous actions erupted, Veesenmayer was Hitler's m ost trenchant facilitator. 108 Born Catholic in 1904 in the town of Bad Kissingen, amid the pastoral rolling hills and lush forests of Bavaria, Veesenma yer quickly took to political economics. He became a professor of economics and b usiness administration at the Technical College in Munich. Veesenmayer joi ned the NSDAP early, in 1932, when he was only twenty-eight years old. When National Socialism came to power in 1933, he became the personal secre tary and economic advisor to Wilhelm Keppler, Hitler's personal econo mic advisor. As such, Keppler functioned as Veesenmayer's direct connecti on to the Fuhrer and the most powerful officials in Germany. 109 Keppler was not only Hitler's personal economic adv isor, he was also Germany's main nexus to American business. Dubbed \" a Kodak Man\" by U.S. military intelligence reports for his links to the Eastman Kodak film company, Keppler owed much to the Kodak Company. Be fore the rise of Hitler, Keppler enjoyed managerial positions with s everal firms that pro- duced photographic gelatins, including one that exp orted heavily to Eastman Kodak in America and Kodak Limited in England. Koda k financed 50 per- cent of Keppler's Odin Company, which specialized i n photo gels. Once Hitler came to power, Keppler advised a number of A merican companies on terminating their Jewish employees. He maintained g ood relations with exec- utives connected to such companies as International Telephone and Tele- graph and National Cash Register, and was Hitler's intermediary to such commercial giants as General Motors. 110 Largely through his Keppler connections, Veesenmaye r eventually joined the board of directors of the German subsidi aries of International Telephone and Telegraph and Standard Oil. 111 Veesenmayer traveled in exec- utive circles and spoke the language of big busines s."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"But Veesenmayer was more than just a corporate l i a i s o n . He was arguably considered Reich Foreign Mini s t e r von Ribbentrop's most important personal troubleshooter and advance man. A technical expert on the eradica- tion of Jewish communities, Veesenmayer was invalua ble as a behind-the- scenes organizer in Hitler's war against the Jews. As such, he had a keen appreciation for statistics and Hollerith capabilit ies. U.S. military intelligence described his meteoric ascent within the Reich's an ti-Jewish destruction machine as \"an amazing career which took him on mis sions to Southeastern Europe always, it would seem, at a moment of troubl e.\" 112 In the months leading up to the March 1938 Anschlus s with Austria, Veesenmayer functioned as the Foreign Office's prin cipal economic expert in Vienna. The day before Austria was taken over, M arch 12, Veesenmayer shuttled Himmler from a Vienna airfield to the Germ an Embassy to help form a new Austrian Nazi regime. The next day, howe ver, before the puppet Austrian government could be installed, Hitler anne xed the country altogether. 113 A year later, in early March 1939, Veesenmayer trav eled to Bratislava to help engineer the destruction of Czechoslovakia and the declaration of a puppet state in Slovakia. On about March 11, he dro ve two handpicked Slo- vak leaders to Vienna where they met Keppler and th en flew on to Berlin for a meeting with Hitler. On that same day, Veesenmaye r wired the Foreign Office, \"alle Juden in der Hand,\" that is, \"all Jew s in hand.\" He remained in Bratislava on March 15 while Czechoslovakia was dis mantled. Jews were quickly identified in the days to come. 114 Veesenmayer was a frequent liaison to foreign milit ant movements. In early 1940, he was assigned to coordinate with two members of the Irish Republican Army visiting Berlin. Later, in Rome, he met with the virulent anti-Semites Amin Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jeru salem, and Rashid Ali Gailani, former Iraqi premier. He escorted both men to Berlin for meetings with Hitler. 115 It was Veesenmayer, who, in April 1941, brokered a written political agreement between Yugoslavian Fascists and a murder ous Croatian militia known as the Ustashi, helping the Croats remain in power as Nazi surrogates with the support of the German Foreign Office. Inde ed, the same day he bro- kered the Ustashi pact, Germany invaded Zagreb. Ust ashi militias were allowed free rein under Veesenmayer's eye. It was V eesenmayer's job to liai- son with Ustashi leader, Ante Pavelich. In the anna ls of wartime savagery against the Jews, there was no group as sadistic as the Croatian Ustashi. Using chainsaws, axes, knives, and rocks, frenzied Swastika-bedecked Ustashi"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"brutally murdered thousands of Jews at a time. Us tashi leaders openly paraded about Zagreb with necklaces comprised of Je wish tongues and eye- balls cut and gouged from women and children, many of them raped and then dismembered or decapitated. Pavelich himself w as fond of offering wicker baskets of Jewish eyeballs as gifts to his d iplomatic visitors. 116 In the first days of December 1940, just after comp leting his assign- ment with the Irish Republican Army and four months before leaving for his behind-the-scenes work with the Ustashi, Veesenmaye r telephoned Hei- dinger and Albert to make the Reich's views on Deho mag known. Then he met with Chauncey. MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION WITH DR. VEESENMAYER Chauncey in Berlin to IBM New York Dr. Veesenmayer is the right hand man of Dr. Kepple r. Dr. Keppler, I am informed, is and has been Hitler's personal economi c advisor. The organiza- tion of which Dr. Keppler is the head is a Nazi Par ty organization called . . . The Department for Policies and Economics. It's not formally a part of the government but has, of course, immense power . . . because it instructs . . . the government on what the Nazi party decides shall be economic policy. I was present when Mr. Heidinger received a request or summons to visit Dr. Keppler and the morning afterwards when I saw D r. Albert, he told me he had not slept all night.... Until this time, Dr. Al bert had been ardendy fighting Mr. Heidinger with respect to any reorganization of Dehomag. . . . The only question of competition was whether or not the mana gers were strong enough to fight, and whether our machines and prices could meet the competition. Dr. Albert did not tell me what the conversation wa s between Mr. Hei- dinger, Dr. Keppler and himself, but did tell me of the conversation with Dr. Veesenmayer which conversation was after the ta lk with Dr. Keppler. Dr. Albert informed me that Dr. Veesenmayer had sai d that under no circum- stances would any coercion be used to force the IBM to give up the majority but that it appeared advisable that the IBM should do so. Dr. Veesenmayer had asked that Dr. Albert and Mr. H eidinger agree on a plan to effect the reorganization and that I should agree in writing to such a plan subject to the approval of the Board of Direct ors of the IBM. Dr. Albert attempted to get me to agree, which I refused on th e ground that any such tentative agreement would lead to the belief offici ally that it would be car- ried out.... If the IBM did not desire to approve i t. .. [then] IBM's position"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"would [only] be more difficult w i t h the officials. I told Dr. Albert that all I would authorize him to say to Dr. Veesenmayer was t hat there had been sev- eral plans submitted to me and these I would in tur n submit to the IBM. Dr. Albert told me that Dr. Veesenmayer had [then] expressed a desire to see me but not in his office, as he would like the conversation to be unoffi- cial. Tentative arrangements were made for me to me et him at lunch. How- ever, Dr. Albert called me one day and informed me that he was going to see Dr. Veesenmayer on the next day.... Dr. Albert call ed me later and said that I should go with him to Dr. Veesenmayer's office. Dr. Veesenmayer stated [to me] that there were adva ntages to be gained by friendly agreements between industries in Americ a and Germany and that it was not unusual to find a desire to have industr ies owned by the nationals of a country. I told him that I appreciated the adv antages of a nationally- owned company whether in Germany or elsewhere. I po inted out to him that competition could be used [just as easily] against Dehomag [if it were] partly-owned by the IBM as it could be used when IB M practically owned the entire company ... I asked him what guarantees IBM could have for the protection of its minority, assuming that it gave u p its majority. He [Veesen- mayer] suggested that no guarantees could be made i n writing but that if the Government approved of the act of increasing the ca pital and the disposition of it to Germans, that should be all the security w e need ask for. Dr. Veesen- mayer did not speak English very well but I underst ood him to say that he had been instrumental in assisting in the re-organi zation of the International Telephone Company in Spain. Subsequendy I attempted , through Dr. Albert, to have Dr. Veesenmayer give me the names of Americ an companies which he had also assisted in re-organizing. The reply was t hat he could not give me the names but that he could tell me that he had jus t about closed the arrangements with two other American companies. In this connection I saw for a moment the names of three German companies wh ich have been re- organized. I did not have the opportunity to get do wn these names, which were in German, nor could I identify them with any American company. . . . Dr. Kiep seemed to be of the opinion that Dr. Keppl er's introduction into the matter was occasioned by Mr. Heidinger. This ma y be so but I do not believe that Mr. Heidinger himself got in touch wit h Dr. Keppler or Dr. Veesenmayer because he appeared to be as much conce rned about the call to Dr. Keppler's office as was Dr. Albert. It is possi ble, however, that through his other friends he [Heidinger] may have brought Dr. K eppler into the subject. 117 "},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Soon after Chauncey met with Veesenmayer Albert del ivered to Chaun- cey a short unsigned, unaddresscd note, typed on pl ain paper. Chauncey for- warded that to New York as well through diplomatic pouch. The party with whom you have discussed the matter o f IBM is Mr. Veesen- mayer. He is the right hand of Dr. Keppler, Secreta ry of State in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but at the same time being entr usted, as an important member of the party with certain special duties and responsibilities, F.I. [for instance] concerning questions of political economi c organizations. Mr. Veesenmayer confirmed the official attitude that no pressure should be brought on IBM to transfer its majority into German hands, but that he thought it advisable to do so. His recommendation t o you was to lose no time in reporting to IBM and then to return as soon as possible to Berlin in order to carry the plan through. 118 Things began happening rapid-fire. On December 5, H eidinger sud- denly agreed to accept a vastly lower purchase pric e for his shares, just RM 3.9 million. What's more, he would accept payment i n IBM's blocked marks and no longer insist upon dollars. A contract with IBM was quickly drawn up and signed on December 13, 1940. 119 IBM felt Heidinger's war was on hold, at least for the moment. But the continuing pressure for IBM to relinquish its major ity remained intense. Equally manifest was the air of tight-lipped myster y surrounding what the Nazis had in mind for the machines. Chauncey studio usly avoided ever ask- ing what additional tasks the machines were intende d for. He nonetheless pressed ahead, demonstrating IBM NY's intention to remain a reliable ven- dor to the Reich. He began organizing new support f or Germany's needs in occupied France, and declared his readiness to inte grate IBM's Polish sub- sidiary into Dehomag proper. He even offered to ext end Dehomag's territory into Russia, which many believed Germany was prepar ing to invade. 120 Even still, a new plan was emerging. The Third Reic h was now hoping to expand Dehomag and all its dominated European IB M subsidiaries into a huge all-inclusive Nazi cartel governed by the Masc hinelles Berichtwesen, the Reich's agency for punch card technology. This cart el would be strengthened by the inclusion of the marginal European branches of Powers, as well as all local companies in invaded lands, such as Bull in F rance and Kamatec in Holland. Machines would be transported from country to country, like so many mortars, across war-ravaged Europe to the prec ise locales needed. Once their mission was accomplished, the devices wo uld be shifted to the"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"next hot spot. The pillars of the cartel would be t he well developed IBM subsidiaries in Italy, France, and Holland. In fact , a special Dehomag employee named Heinz Westerholt, the Nazi Party's d irect agent within the subsidiary, had already traveled to France to initi ate the arrangements in both Vichy and occupied territory. The Germans work ing through French authorities had already demanded a test integration of Bull systems with Hollerith tabulators and sorters. 121 The planned punch card cartel would then be able to accomplish all the Reich's most important objectives without channelin g requests through the IBM corporate bureaucracy or submitting to Watson m icro-management. Germany's IBM-based cartel could function as a bina ry with Watson's non- European operation. Ultimately, the attempted cartel would be bitterly fought by Watson, deploying every technologic, legal, financial, and political argument at IBM's disposal. Eventually, by mid-1941, the Nazis conclu ded that connecting Holleriths to other systems was mechanically imposs ible, and operationally naive. Unlikable as it was, Germany needed an agree ment with Watson in which he agreed to supply all the Reich's needs, re ceive proper payment, but remain detached from the local details his mana gers and engineers would necessarily possess. Ironically, such a modus vivendi appealed gready to Watson. IBM as a company would know the innermost details o f Hitler's Holle- rith operations, designing the programs, printing t he cards, and servicing the machines. But Watson and his New York directors cou ld erect a wall of credi- ble deniability at the doors of the executive suite . In theory, only those down the hall in the New York headquarters who communica ted direcdy with IBM Geneva, such as IBM European General Manager Schott e, could provide a link to the reality in Europe. But in fact, any suc h wall contained so many cracks, gaps, and hatches as to render it imaginary . The free flow of informa- tion, instructions, requests, and approvals by Wats on remained detailed and continuous for years to come—until well into 1944. Subsidiary managers were authorized by New York to negotiate special equipment rental and service agreements from the Ma schinelles Berichtwesen and other Reich officials. Projects in Europe were approved and customers prioritized with New York's permission. Machines we re moved from place to place to meet the demand. IBM Europe's managers rec eived special permis- sion from the Nazi authorities to travel back and f orth between neutral nations, Nazi-held territory, and Germany itself. T hey regularly sent IBM NY letters and reports. Some were simply handwritten n otes. Others were dense"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"sales and machine status reports, or meticulous mon thly summaries, all sent from Axis-co n t r o l l e d subsidiaries to New York throu gh neutral c itie s. 1 2 2 When Geneva executives were pressed for time, they telephoned New York. Using codes and oblique references, they none theless all spoke the same language, even when the language was vague. As one previous Euro- pean General Manager, John Holt, urged an IBM NY co lleague early in the war: \"wire Schotte for the information which you ne ed, care being taken that your request is so worded that it can pass the cens or. It goes without saying that any information covering military activity is apt to get the recipient, as well as the sender, into considerable 'hot water.'\" 123 Together the continuous reports, summaries, cables, and telephone calls offered minute-to-minute operational details of IBM 's activities in France, Italy, and Sweden; the serial number and location o f equipment; and pre- cisely which machines were destined to be shipped t o Dehomag or the Ger- man army. Devices and spare parts going into the Re ich or elsewhere in Nazi-conquered Europe were tracked by New York—from the most complex collator to the simplest sorting brush. Despite the turmoil of Dehomag's revolt, throughout 1940 and 1941 the fluid decision to build new factories to supply Nazi Germany, the stocking of those facto ries, and the year-to-year ordering of expensive machine tools, these decision s were made by IBM NY based on the most current market information. Paper factory output and anticipated shortages throughout Europe were monito red to anticipate prob- lems before they occurred. 124 Millions of punch cards were routinely shipped from IBM in America directly to Nazi-controlled sources in Poland, Fran ce, Bulgaria, and Belgium, or routed circuitously through Sweden or colonies i n Africa. When IBM's American presses did not fill orders, subsidiaries themselves would ship cards across frontiers from one IBM location to ano ther. 125 All money was accounted for and audited down to the franc and lira. All expenses were deferentially proposed to New Yor k and carefully ap- proved or rejected. Watson was even told that the F rench subsidiary had charged an extra 1.5 francs for wine with lunch in the company canteen. 126 But in December 1940, things were different. The pl an for an MB cartel was still very much alive in the Nazi game plan. Mo reover, the constantly evolving special plans for Hitler's Holleriths were beginning to take shape. Periodically, when Chauncey inadvertently raised an issue that came close to the cartel question, the managers at Dehomag would mysteriously comment, \"there were concentration camps,\" and then become c ompletely silent. On December 13, 1940, Chauncey wrote to Watson, \"I men tioned to Hummel"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"that now might be a good opportunity to acquire our rights from Bull, he vaguely hinted that perhaps the Bull Company in Fra nce has already been acquired by others. When I pressed him for an expla nation, he would say nothing more. When I reach a point with these fello ws, they begin to talk of concentration camps, etc.\" 127 A few days later, on December 17, Chauncey was disc ussing the issue of Heidinger defecting to a competitive company and de stroying the subsidiary. Hummel first swore Chauncey to secrecy and then rev ealed, \"Heidinger would never fight Dehomag.\" Chauncey then reported to IBM NY that he \"went along with him [Hummel] in the hopes that he would not retire within a shell, or completely shut up with the explanation that 'there were concen- tration camps'!\" 128 About that time, Otto Kiep surprised Chauncey by my steriously stating it was better for directors to decline any stock in Dehomag—even token Rock. On December 13, Chauncey wrote to Watson with out elaborating, \"it is Mr. Kiep's opinion that no shares should be issu ed to the directors, because of something he has learned.\" Like the othe r messages, Chauncey channeled the message through the Embassy. 129 Chauncey made clear to Watson in his various writin gs that Germany's use of machines throughout conquered Europe would b e profoundly lucra- tive, and IBM could not give up the profits. Albert described an enticing Axis-wide punch card monopoly that would rule in \"G ermany's possible future economic space comprising not only the incre ased [Reich] territory [itself], but the sphere of... Central Europe to th e Balkans, the African pos- sessions, and the Near East.\" 130 But to remain a viable member of the Nazi juggernau t, Albert explained, Watson would have to adopt a decision no t to just do business with and extract profit from Nazi Germany, but to e nsure that Dehomag become an organic facet of the Third Reich itself. In a twenty-one-page rec- ommendation to Watson, Albert circumlocutiously des cribed the cooperation Veesenmayer expected. \"The structure of the German economic system,\" Albert wrote, \"requires that every German undertaki ng is completely, loyally and without any reservation a member of that system , as formed by National Socialist leadership. What matters is . . . the spi rit of German economic lead- ership—and not who is the owner of the shares.... t he business policy of the German company . . . [must be] in complete harmony with the German national interests, and it is the business of the m en at the head of the Ger- man undertaking to see to that. Of course, if the c ompany's interests are not so defended, either because the parties concerned g row weary under the"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"weight of those difficulties... [or] perhaps became at heart they themselves share the adversarial point of view... the company will suffer.\" 131 Watson was willing to cooperate—as he had done sinc e the first days of the Third Reich. But why was it necessary to give u p majority ownership? Majority ownership was something a man like Watson could not bear to relinquish. But everything seemed to rest on that v ery fulcrum: IBM becom- ing a minority owner of its own enterprise. Only if IBM reduced its ownership to less than 50 p ercent would the contemplated competition be suppressed and Watson's profits be protected. Yet the guarantees, all oral, seemed too vague for IBM to trust. Chauncey wrote Watson, \"Dr. Veesenmayer . . . stated that he was not in a position to give me any written statement,\" and added that \"the transaction must be approved by the [German] government and that would be all the guarantee we needed.\" Chauncey also reported his conversation with a director of the Deutsche Bank, Dr. Kimlich, who concurred with Vees enmayer. \"Dr. Kimlich stated that his organization [Deutsche Bank] would take care of any competi- tion, ... [a] statement he would not amplify, but o nly repeated.\" 132 Reducing ownership to a minority bothered Chauncey' s sense of profit as well. \"IBM will have reduced its interest in the German company to less than 50 percent,\" he complained to New York, \"and i ts share of the future profits proportionately.\" 133 IBM wanted both—to remain a commercial part of the Nazi domination in Europe and keep all the p rofits. Only Watson could decide. Chauncey confirmed to Wat son and the other senior executives in New York that he had pro mised Veesenmayer that he would fly back to America and brief company offi cials. Then he would immediately fly back to Berlin and personally deliv er to Veesenmayer IBM's answer. 134 Veesenmayer would now play a special role both with IBM and the Third Reich's war against the Jews. As statistics a nd human sorting con- tinued in the drama of Jewish destruction, the two would intertwine. Chauncey's chaotic consultations with Veesenmayer a nd others about the future of IBM in Europe would keep the young attorn ey in Berlin and Geneva until late March 1941. 135 Just days after Chauncey finally departed for New Y ork, Veesenmayer would travel to Yugoslavia to oversee the Reich's a ffairs with the Ustashi. By early April, Veesenmayer was arranging with Croat l eaders and the Ustashi \"an exact plan for the assumption of power.\" 136 But Veesenmayer ultimately emerged as much more tha n just Hitler's"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"envoy to communal destruction. He would soon become a technical sched- uler of actual genocide. One of the earliest episodes occurred in fall 1941. Germany's Minister to Yugoslavia, Fritz Benzler, asked for an expert t o handle difficulties with the Jewish situation. The Foreign Office sent Veese nmayer. On September 8, Veesenmayer and Benzler proposed that 8,000 Jews in Serbia be deported down the Danube on barges into Romania for further action. Berlin did not answer quickly enough, so forty-eight hours later V eesenmayer and his col- league sent a follow-up dispatch: \"Quick and dracon ian settlement of the Serbian Jewish question is most urgent. . . . Reque st authorization from the Foreign Minister to place maximum pressure on the S erbian military com- mand e r . No opposition is to be expected from the Se rb government.\" 137 Soon, the question was routed to Adolf Eichmann, th e Reich's expert for Jewish affairs. The reply: \"Eichmann proposes s hooting.\" By September 28, the German general commander in the area wanted all 8,000 rounded up for \"immediate elimination.\" In early October 1941, German army comman- ders in conjunction with Serb mayors and police beg an picking up Jews from cities and towns in a lightning Aktion, or Act ion. Victims were driven and then marched to an open pit in a remote locatio n, and there ordered to kneel over the trench. German soldiers at ten paces would fire rifles at their head and chest. Line by line, thousands of murdered Jews slumped into the earth. 1 3 8 Days later, the Foreign Office rebuked Benzler and Veesenmayer for becoming too involved in the technical and military aspects. They were reminded to confine themselves to such matters as s imply arranging trans- portation. 139 Later, in July 1943, Foreign Minister von Ribbentro p wanted President Tiso of Slovakia to accelerate the \"cleanup\" of the Jewish question there. The Slovakians were reluctant because the war was not g oing well for Germany and Slovakian leaders could no longer plead ignoran ce of the genocide. In December 1943, Veesenmayer was again sent to Bratis lava. In one meeting with Eichmann's expert Dieter Wisliceny, Veesenmaye r angrily reviewed Eichmann's detailed statistical reports of Slovakia n Jews both by ancestry and religious belief. Veesenmayer was impatient for action. He vowed to talk \"blundy\" with President Tiso. After their talks, Ti so agreed to transport the remaining 16,000 to 18,000 unconverted Jews to conc entration camps—no exceptions permitted. Shortly thereafter, 10,000 ba ptized Jews were added to the rolls. 140 "},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"In spring 1944, after a stint at der Fuhrer's headq uarters, Veesenmayer would be sent East again, this ti m e as Minister to Hungary. His instructions were to form a new puppet government in Budapest an d organize the Hun- garian railroads. 141 Veesenmayer was for the first time completely in ch arge of German operations in a puppet nation. In Budapest, he form ed a close alliance with Eichmann and together they orchestrated the systema tic destruction of Hun- garian Jewry. According to Veesenmayer's 1941 censu s statistics, 724,307 Jews lived in Hungary. Another 62,000 were consider ed Jewish by blood. But Hungarian leaders, although rabidly anti-Semiti c, were reluctant to con- tinue their on-again off-again persecution of the J ews. The Allies had already announced that there would be war crime tribunals f or genocide. Warnings conveyed by neutral leaders and the Vatican were co ming in continuously. Russian troops were steadily advancing from the Eas t. The Hungarians were openly worried. 142 But Veesenmayer, with Eichmann at his side, hammere d out a domestic power-sharing agreement with those Hungarian leader s that would ignore the Allies and cooperate with Hitler's mandate. To ensure close supervision, he installed his own expert in the Hungarian Office of Jewish Affairs to mon- itor a torrent of anti-Semitic decrees. Veesenmayer described the progress as one of \"unusual rapidity under local conditions.\" 143 A few weeks later, with confiscation and ghettoizat ion nearly complete, the deportations began. Veesenmayer divided Hungary into five zones, plus Budapest. But Zone 1, the Carpathians, require d a full seven weeks to empty because not enough trains were available. On April 20, 1944, Veesen- mayer complained to the Foreign Office that he was unable to locate enough freight cars for his task. But by the end of April, two trains were arranged. Each carried 4,000 Jews from the Kistarcsa internme nt camp. Destination: Auschwitz. 144 Veesenmayer would learn to locate freight cars and schedule them in and out of Hungary like clockwork. As efficiency in creased, only ten days would be needed per zone. After the zones were empt ied in late June, 437,402 Jews were gone. But then a struggle ensued as to whether Budapest's Jews would be deported to their death as well. Hungarian leaders hated Jews but feared war crimes trials more. Veese nmayer did not care how close the Russians were. A stalemate developed with Hungarian Chief of State Admiral Miklos Horthy. Eichmann sent one trai n filled with Budapest Jews to a death camp only to have Horthy order it s topped at the border and sent back. 145 "},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Horthy eventually dismissed the puppet leaders Vees enmayer had installed and ordered their arrest. Veesenmayer pro tested bitterly and com- plained to Berlin. Von Ribbentrop telegraphed a war ning: \"The Fuhrer ex- pects that the measures against the Budapest Jews w ill now be taken without any further delay by the Hungarian government ... n o delay of any kind in the execution of the general measures against Jews [will be permitted].\" 146 Veesenmayer then warned Horthy that two additional Wehrmacht armored units would soon be sent to Hungary. Horthy still refused to coop- erate. Eventually, Veesenmayer ordered Horthy's son kidnapped. Bundled into a blanket, the son was driven to an airfield a nd flown to Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria. Veesenmayer threaten ed to have the younger Horthy shot if Hungary did not comply. 147 Compromises, broken and amended, were made with Hun garian lead- ers. Eventually, Hungary agreed to deport 50,000 Je ws to Austria and, the remainder of Budapest Jewry were sent to concentrat ion camps. Beginning on October 20, 1944, thousands of terrified, weepin g Jews were pulled from t h e i r apartments and homes in all-day operations. T here weren't enough freight cars. So within days, the 27,000 assembled Jews were sent on a death march to the Austrian border. Lines of marching Jew s stretched out from Budapest, miles and miles long, girded by a paralle l of corpses heaped along the road. Veesenmayer reported that 2,000 to 4,000 were being added daily. Many thousands died en route from the exhaustion, e xposure, and starva- tion. They were in fact marched to death. 148 During the war years, IBM supplied elaborate Holler ith systems to nearly all the railways of Nazi-dominated Europe. 149 Knowing how many freight cars and locomotives to schedule on any giv en day in any given loca- tion, anywhere across the map of Europe, required t he computational capa- bilities of Hollerith. 150 Punch card systems identified the exact location o f each freight car, how much cargo it could accept, a nd what schedule it could adhere to for maximum efficiency. 151 In fact, the main method of tracking freight cars was a network of Hollerith systems ins talled at railroad junctions across Europe. 152 Using IBM equipment, freight car locations were up dated every forty-eight hours. Without it, the location o f rolling stock would gener- ally be more than two weeks out of date and useless in a wartime setting. 153 In 1938 alone, more than 200 million punch cards we re printed for Euro- pean railroads. 154 In Nazi Poland, the railroads, which constituted s ome 95 percent of the IBM subsidiary's business, were accu stomed to using more than 21 million cards annually. 155 In Nazi-allied Romania, the railroads used a large installation of machines in the Ministry of Communications. 156 "},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"In Yugoslavia, where Veesenmayer worked with the Us tashi, the rail- roads used Ministry of Commerce machines in Belgrad e. 157 In Hungary, where Veesenmayer and Eichmann coordinated continuo usly with the rail- roads, the machines were Holleriths. 158 Standardized forms on daily reports registered every detail of train operation from pas senger load per car and fuel consumed per train, to locomotive efficiency a nd which government department would be billed for the freight. 159 Hollerith made the trains run on time in Nazi Europe. These were the trains Veese nmayer and his cohorts relied upon. During all the genocide years, 1942-1945, the Dehom ag that Watson fought to protect did remain intact. Ultimately, it was governed by a special Reich advisory committee representing the highest e chelons of the Nazi hier- archy. The Dehomag advisory committee replaced the traditional corporate board of directors. As with any board, the committe e's duty was to advise senior management, approve and veto special project s, and mandate priori- ties. The day-to-day decisions were left to manager s to execute. When needed, it coordinated with IBM Geneva or its repre sentatives in other sub- sidiaries. Four men sat on the advisory board. One was a trustee. Second was Passow, chief of the Maschinelles Berichtwesen. Thi rd was Heidinger. Fourth was Adolf Hitler's personal representative. 160 Hitler's representative on Dehomag's advisory commi ttee was Dr. Ed- mund Veesenmayer. 161 "},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"PART THREE "},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"10 THE STRUGGLE TO STAY IN THE AXIS DURING THE WINTER OF 1940-1941, AS CHAUNCEY NEGOTIA TED with Nazis in Germany, war enveloped Europe. While Watson and IBM executives were fighting daily to retain their com- mercial primacy in the Axis conquest machine, milli ons of Jews were fighting to stay alive in a continent overrun with highly orga- nized, intensely automated Nazi forces and their su rrogates. News- paper articles, dramatic photos, and newsreels cont inued to tell the tragic, even if by now familiar, story of Jewish de struction. November 9, 1940, New York Times, \"Reich Jews Sent to South France; 1 0,000 Reported Put Into Camps.\" At Camp de Gurs, the refugees, it was said, were forced to live in small wooden barracks without enough water and prac tically no food supply. 1 November 26, 1940, New York Times, \"Walls Will Encl ose War- saw Jews Today; 500,000 Begin 'New Life' in Nazi-Bu ilt Ghetto.\" By Herman decree, all Jews in Warsaw have been require d to take up resi- dence in the ghetto . . . with as many as seven per sons living in one room in some buildings.

[A Gurs camp source reported] \"They will not fight any more; apathetic, they lie on their straw mattresses, ofte n refusing food and waiting for the end.\" 8 Despite all the atrocity stories being broadcast, \" Watson was waging his own struggle. His was an undying determination to r etain IBM's favored dominance in the Third Reich's commercial-industria l complex. The struggle was not going well. In the first week of January 19 41, German Finance Ministry officials ruled that IBM's setdement with Heidinger , worth almost $900,000, could not be transacted using the company's blocked Reichsmarks. In frustration, Chauncey sent word to New York that he would \"have to begin all over again.\" One of the main government objections was the continuing existence of IBM's so-called royalty program, which was considered a sham to extract profits from Germany in the form of fake ex penses. Why else, critics complained, did IBM's own subsidiary pay the parent company royalties? 9 At the same time, Party circles continued to demand IBM shed its majority ownership. IBM executives began to wonder if they might sell some"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"shares to the Hitler government itself, going into a direct partnership with the Reich, \"provided, simultaneously, official form al recognition by the gov- ernment . . . [of] the validity and binding nature of the royalty agreement.\" On January 24, 1941, a Nazi official at the Deutsch e Bank met with Chauncey and repeated the assertion that if IBM ced ed the majority, \"we will take care of any new competition.\" New York did not mind making a token transfer to some German nationals, but Watson still hoped he would not be forced to reduce IBM's ownership to a minority. 10 By the very end of January, a tired Chauncey was ho ping to return to Manhattan to make his confidential report in the se curity of IBM headquar- ters. Once he obtained the board's decision, he wou ld fly back to Berlin and again confer with Veesenmayer as promised. By now, Chauncey had learned when speaking over the phone to refer to Veesenmaye r obliquely as \"that official\" or \"an official.\" Chauncey went to Geneva and phoned New York for his next instructions. The conversation, as usual, was conducted in code and studded with cryptic allusions. 11 J ANUARY 31, 1941, 4:45 P . M . Chauncey at IBM Geneva John G. Phillips and Charles R. Ogsbury at IBM NY P HILLIPS : Hello, Harry, this is Phillips.... C HAUNCEY : Yes. There are two courses open to me at the moment . I shall send you a report of the big question [retaining th e majority], which I can- not even here send to you completely in all respect s, over the telephone or written.... Or I could come back to the United Stat es and give you a writ- ten report... . [But] then I [must] return to Germa ny at the request of \"an official.\" P HILLIPS : You cannot define that any more? C HAUNCEY : No, but you can understand. Because of the time tha t may be in- volved, I promised \"that official\" that I would go back to America with some degree of haste and return as soon as possible .

I think you will find all that correspondence with Ta ylor. I think you ought to get acquainted with it and see who is sponsoring that.

Every message relayed through an American Embassy o r Legation was not just blindly passed on. Multiple copies were made f or senior staff in \"Wash- ington. Periodically, Watson sent letters of gratit ude for the on-going help. For example, on January 8, 1941, Watson mailed Paul T. Culbertson, Euro- pean Affairs division assistant chief: \"I wish to t hank you for the courtesy you extended our company in connection with the transfe r of a letter to me from Mr. Harrison K. Chauncey, representative of our com pany, who is temporar- ily in Berlin. The promptness in which this matter was handled has been a real help to us and all of the officers of our comp any join me in expressing our appreciation to you.\" 14 The Department's desire to secretly advance the com mercial causes of IBM persevered in spite of the nation's officially stated opposition to the Hitler menace. For this reason, it was vital to Wat son that nothing be done to embarrass or even annoy the Department publicly. Th is caution was only heightened by an on-going FBI investigation into IB M's operation as a potential hotbed of Nazi sympathizers. Avoiding emb arrassing moments was difficult given the far-flung global empire of IBMe rs so deeply involved with Fascist and Axis countries, and accustomed to speak ing supportively of their clients' military endeavors. Walter G. Ross, affectionately known as \"Capt. Ross ,\" was one of IBM's most adventurous and freewheeling European agents s tationed on the Conti- nent, triumphantly concluding important deals for t he company. He was once"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"described by IBM as \"one of the colorful ones,\" who se \"zeal and dedication . . . [and] exploits would be recounted for decades . Capt. Ross was primarily assigned to Fascist Spain, where he concentrated on the Spanish Railways. In 1940, the popular Ross was ready to retire. He woul d leave behind a newly organized IBM subsidiary in Spain and would continu e on as a special advi- sor. \"When he came back to the United States in Aug ust 1940, the flamboyant salesman made some comments to a local newspaper, t he Brooklyn Eagle. 15 Those comments caused a furor. In his candid remarks, Ross predicted that England would be forced into an armistice within two weeks, thereby abandoning E urope. Moreover, he openly revealed his approval of and cooperation wit h the Hitler regime. \"He [Ross] ... has first-hand knowledge, having lived i n the same building as the German Minister ... On reaching these shores, the C aptain was 'simply terri- fied and appalled' by the ultra-frank outbursts of American officials against Hitler and Mussolini, which, he opines, were in the manner of 'spindly boys tweaking the neighborhood bullies' noses'... 'I am an American,' he sums up, 'but I say that before you start calling names be s ure you're prepared: This country thinks it's going to spend a lot of money a nd make soldiers over- night. You can't do it. Germany worked at it for fi ve years'. . . The Germans, he contends, had better trained soldiers, superior equipment and stream- lined generals.\" Ross also declared he had conceive d a plan in which Watson could use his channels to funnel money to destitute civilians in Europe. 16 The seemingly inconsequential article did not escap e the attention of those in Washington on the lookout for Nazi sympath izers. Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle sent a clipping to J. Edgar Ho over at the FBI declaring, \"the remarks . . . follow the same pattern used in all German propaganda.\" Copies of the article made the rounds at the State Department and IBM. Quickly, Watson learned of the embarrassment. In an example of how Watson, if so moved, could act with swift corporate wrath t o protect the company's in- terest, Watson immediately turned on Ross. In an in stant, Ross' decades of col- orful accomplishments for IBM were forgotten. He wa s summarily cut off. 17 On September 6, 1940, Watson wrote Ross a humiliati ng termination letter. \"I have before me a clipping from the Brook lyn Eagle of August 28, 1940, in which you pretend to speak as a representa tive of our Company,\" Watson began. \"You were our agent working on a comm ission basis in Spain for several years, until we arranged with you in Pa ris, in August 1939, for your retirement.... \"You used my name in connection with a plan which y ou state you have of sending monetary aid to refugees and destitute c ivilians in France, in which"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"you say I am willing to cooperate.

We had discussed the possibility of mak ing use of you in some other capacity in our business, but the statement y ou made in the article referred to makes it impossible for us to do so. I am attaching to this letter the regular cancellation notice of your contract.\" 18 On September 6, 1940, Ross indeed wrote the editor of the Brooklyn Eagle a stultifying retraction that sounded as thou gh it had been typed in Watson's office. The typewriter seemed to be the sa me as the one used for Watson's letter, and the typist's identifying initi als, \"LH,\" were at the bottom of both letters. Moreover, Ross' retraction used th e nearly identical first sen- tence as Watson's letter of the same day. \"I have b efore me a clipping from the Brooklyn Daily Eagle of August 28, 1940,\" Ross' retraction stated, \"which purports to be an interview with one of your report ers at your office.

In other instances, some IBMers pushed the State De partment's diplo- matic pouch to the limits of propriety. It was one thing to help an American company protect its investment in Germany, but usin g diplomatic channels to deepen IBM's Nazi relationships in occupied countri es sometimes made the Department recoil. On October 2, 1940, IBM's man in occupied Denmark. Max Bodenhoff, sent Watson a letter through the Ame rican Legation suggest- ing the company hire a personal friend of German Fo reign Minister von Ribbentrop as a special business agent to further t he subsidiary's work with the Nazis there. America's interim charge in Copenh agen, Mahlon F. Perkins, was dubious about transmitting such a letter throug h official channels. 21 \"Max Bodenhoff . . . represents Mr. Watson's organi zation in Copen- hagen,\" wrote the rankled charge in a complaint sen t in triplicate to Washing- ton. \"This letter is not transmitted in the manner prescribed by Diplomatic Serials 3267 and 3268 of August 9, 1940, since it i s considered that the Department should decide upon the propriety of tran smitting it. It will be noted that Mr. Bodenhoff suggests to Mr. Watson the employment of Dr. Orla Arntzen, who is a close friend of the German Foreig n Minister, to act as a special representative of the International Busines s Machines Corporation. This procedure would appear to involve questions of policy and ethics which the Department may desire to consider.\" 22 Perkins' objection was reviewed by no fewer than ei ght officials. All concurred that his judgment should be vindicated by sending Bodenhoff's letter back to Copenhagen with the declaration: \"Th e Department does not believe it would be advisable to transmit the lette r mentioned and it is accordingly returned to the Legation.\" 23 At one point, a State Department officer notified I BM NY: \"The Depart- ment understands that commercial telegraphic facili ties are available between the United States and Germany. Should you experienc e difficulty in commu- nicating . . . the Department will be pleased to co nsider the transmission . . . through official channels at your expense provided you supply the full names of the persons or firms abroad whose interests are affected thereby, and in- form the Department as to the nature of those inter ests, and whether such persons or firms have American nationality. I belie ve you will readily appreci- ate that the Department, especially in these extrao rdinary times, must reserve its facilities for the service of legitimate Americ an interests.\" 24 Despite the occasional realization that the State D epartment was be- coming an all too indispensable player in the proli feration and protection of"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"IBM's lucrative relations with the Nazis in Europe, its role would soon exceed the realm of postman. Soon, diplomats in Ber lin would become IBM's special operatives in saving the company's ni che in the Nazi Axis. CHAUNCEY RETURNED to Berlin to renew his excruciating negotiations wi th Heidinger. Ironically, as the United States edged c loser to entering the war, Heidinger believed his options were becoming more l imited. In the strange praxis of German law, once Dehomag became enemy pro perty, the subsidiary would be seized by a receiver and all ownership fro zen. In such a case, Hei- dinger's hope to cash out would also be frozen. If competition supplanted IBM, his stock holdings could soon become worthless . By early March 1941, Heidinger agreed to a new setd ement—RM 2.2 million in exchange for giving up his preferential stockholder status. He would still own his shares, and those shares could still be sold only to IBM upon his departure from the company—but the price would be t he book value. 25 Reich economic bureaucrats approved because the tra nsaction wasn't as much a sale as a reduction in status—and Heiding er was handsomely compensated for his various overdue bonuses. 26 But Veesenmayer was still insistent that IBM relinq uish its majority or face a newly created cartel. And now the cartel had a name: Wanderer-Werke. The old-line German motorcycle and toolmaker, Wande rer-Werke, was being primed by the Reich to host a merger of French Bull and Powers interests, allowing a new punch card enterprise to be forged. The Powers companies were now controlled by Hermann Goering Works under an overlapping board of directors. By now, Germany had realized that nei ther of the marginal firms, Bull or Powers, possessed the necessary production capacity. A completely new German-owned factory would be needed. Bull schemati cs and blueprints had already been brought to Berlin to launch a new machine series in case IBM would not yield. Germany could not afford an im mediate separation from the IBM empire. But if Watson would not comply voluntarily, a steady combination of tactics from preferential business c ontracts for Wanderer- Werke to mandatory price reductions at Dehomag woul d compel an eventual sell-out. This approach is what Veesenmayer conside red \"no pressure.\" 27 Opinions flagged from day to day on whether the Rei ch could proceed without IBM. Even with a crash program to build new machines, it would take months before the first machine would roll off asse mbly lines. Without a source for punch cards, it would be like producing guns without bullets. Understandably, Veesenmayer's pressure was carefull y applied. If IBM with-"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"drew and suddenly stopped servicing the Reich, Nazi automation would soon rattle to a halt. \"We are threatened with possible elimination of Deh omag through competition,\" Chauncey reported to New York on Marc h 10, 1941, \"which may be sponsored by the authorities. We are also th reatened with attack on the royalty agreement; and further threatened with a substantial reduction in prices if we do not give up the majority.\" 28 Chauncey could only repeat, \"Dr. Veesenmayer . . . stated that no pres- sure [would] be brought to bear to surrender the ma jority but that it was advisable to do so. He told me all that was wanted was a friendly agreement. ... I asked Dr. Veesenmayer for some assurance of p rotection for our minority in the event we relinquished the majority. He repli ed . . . there could not be any writing of assurance.\" 29 There was no pretense that Dehomag's management was still a group of\" independent-minded employees or executives. They we re openly pawns of the Nazi Party. \"Mr. Heidinger and several other me mbers of the board are Nazi members,\" stressed Chauncey. \"As nearly as I c an learn, they have to fol- low any order issued by the Nazi Party.\" 30 But a rebellious Chauncey still clung to his revuls ion over what he called \"blackmail threats.\" Giving up the majority would not protect the com- pany's investment, he argued. \"Upon giving up the m ajority,\" he asserted, \"we can obtain no assurance that the next attack would not be against the [re- maining IBM] minority and even against the payment of royalties.\" Chauncey had termed the German unhappiness as mere \"growling .\" It was easy to talk about starting a new cartel. The reality was unchan ged: \"The government at the present time needs our machines. The army is us ing them presendy for every conceivable purpose.\" 31 So while IBM came to believe they could not be disl odged from the Axis, they did fear the diminishment of profit that any a ttempted competition, howsoever tenuous or distant, might pose. The man w ho would not even tolerate competition from used cash registers would now only intensify his effort to block competition from diluting IBM p rofits. Ironically, the diligence of IBM auditors to certify and report tha t profit never paused dur- ing the entire Dehomag Revolt. Even as Watson expen ded maximum re- sources to protect his monopoly, the accountants we re busy double-checking every penny.

These in- voices were missing from Dehomag's periodic submiss ions. To track them, New York accountants made a written request to Gene va on December 23, 1940. Taylor in Geneva issued a detailed two-page s ingle-spaced item-by- item response on February 14, 1941, with a simultan eous written request to Dehomag in Berlin to resubmit the invoices in dupli cate. On February 26, 1941, Dehomag accountants sent a letter in German t o Geneva confirming that a new reconciliation statement would be sent o ut; a translation into Eng- lish was forwarded to New York. The four invoices w ere ultimately tracked: one was for $525.60, a second was for $46.77, a thi rd was for $23.44, and the fourth was for $1.52. 33 At IBM, every penny counted. But on March 12, 1941, Germany's cracking wartime e conomy put an even greater strain on the flow of money from Dehom ag. Reich Economics Minister Walther Funk warned at the annual Reichsba nk stockholders lunch- eon that \"drastic restrictions\" on corporate profit s would soon be announced. Dividends in excess of 6 percent would be subjected to \"prohibitive taxation.\" The only way to correct reduced profits was a volun tary increase in capitaliza- tion permissible during a brief investment window; 6 percent of the higher capital investment would of course yield greater pr ofit sums. In other words, only those who further invested in the German econo my could continue to reap significant profits. Funk's words sent off ala rm bells throughout IBM. 34 More bells sounded when, in late May 1941, IBM real ized that Dehomag was cutting prices to support the German war effort without IBM's permission. MEMORANDUM TO THOMAS J. WATSON From: J. C. Milner Subject: German Rental Prices May 23, 1941 We have heard from the Geneva office that the Germa n Company have re- duced their rental prices to customers by approxima tely ten percent. This will naturally mean that our royalties will be affected in the same proportion. Although we have no recent figures from Germany, we would estimate that the ten percent reduction would mean a reduction of approximately 1,500,000 Reichsmarks in the gross annual rentals of the Germ an Company. 35 "},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"On June 12, 1941 the Reich i s s u e d its profil restri cting regulations. Those profit l i mi t s affected not only I B M , but prof it bonuses for Heidinger, Rottke, and Hummel as well. The German managers kne w that if IBM did not increase its investment, bonuses would not be possi ble. A loophole in German law, however, allowed the board of directors—with o r without majority approval—to reinvest its funds in the company. Deho mag had accrued mil- lions of blocked Reichsmarks in undistributed profi ts waiting to be allocated. The Nazi board could vote to reinvest that money, t hus increasing the stock of the company. More stock meant more shares. Under German law, when a company increased its shares with new investment, t he new shares were allo- cated in the identical proportions as the existing ownership. In other words, the percentages would remain the same—just everyone would own more— as in any stock split. These new shares would be di stributed without taxes. 36 Heidinger and company decided they would rush a vot e through to double the capital of the company, from about RM 7. 7 million to about RM 15 million, using IBM's blocked profits. They would force a vote with or without IBM precisely because the law allowed direc tors to vote reinvest- ment without shareholder consent. 37 Much more was at stake for IBM than just reinvestin g its profits into the Dehomag. Up until now, although IBM retained about 85 percent of the shares, the 15 percent owned by Heidinger, Rottke, and Hummel were restricted shares. Unlike most stock holdings, Deho mag shares could not be routinely sold, collateralized, or transferred like ordinary shares in any com- pany. The shares were owned only so long as the thr ee managers remained with the company and could not be sold to anyone ot her than IBM. More- over, each man had obtained the shares not by an or dinary purchase but through a large paper loan from IBM that was cancel ed when the loans were \"given back.\" In essence, the three German managers owned captive stock that Watson controlled. 38 If Dehomag's total stock doubled to RM 15 million, the new shares would be distributed 85 percent to IBM and 15 perce nt to the Germans— with one extraordinary difference. Fifteen percent of the new shares would proportionately flow to the three Germans automatic ally. Restrictive covenants would not apply to the new shares. Heidinger, Rottk e, and Hummel could sell or trade their shares to anyone, including the new cartel. And the shares would be distributed free—no loans, no payments. 39 Matters began coming to a head when the Dehomag req uested that an additional profit should be declared so bonuses cou ld be paid.

No dividends to be declared.\" IBM Europe Manager W. C. Lier was about to dictate a letter to Dehomag advising as much when distressing correspon dence arrived from Albert in Berlin. Albert warned that the German boa rd's true intentions were not just to declare profits, but to double the stoc k from blocked funds and distribute shares before any restrictive covenants could be imposed. 40 Lier shelved his letter to Dehomag. Instead he cabl ed IBM NY: \"Albert confidentially advises: Dehomag preparing another m eeting which may decide without IBM represented. According Albert, D ehomag planning increase capital to such extent as to get [shares] out of IBM control.. .. Kiep not sufficient since can be outvoted.\" 41 All understood that IBM would be compelled to vote in favor of—or more precisely, authorize—the stock split. There we re so many reasons. First, it was the only way to extract a hefty 12 percent d ividend from revenues and corcumvent the Reich's new profit restriction. New York wanted that. More- over, Albert knew IBM could not control the numeric al vote of the board. The vote to split would prevail in any event. But N ew York could not allow a vote to be taken without IBM's consent or involveme nt—even if that consent was pressured or begrudged. Such a precedent would lead to unending business decisions without IBM's involvement. First it would be Dehomag. Then Dehomag would maneuver the other European subs idiaries. Watson would not permit it. 42 Most of all, if IBM voted against reinvestment in G ermany at this crucial stage in the negotiations with the Nazi Party it wo uld only reinforce the per- ception that Watson was unfriendly to the Third Rei ch. Albert urged IBM to be represented at the meeting, which seemed to be planned for mid-September, and unequivocally vote i ts majority in favor of the stock split. If nothing else, IBM could coopera te in the stock split on the condition that the new shares distributed to German s were brought under the same restrictive agreements as the prior shares . However, to appear for IBM, Albert needed a proxy. Chauncey had foreseen s uch an emergency be- fore he left Germany in the spring. He left a forma l proxy in the custody of a t h i r d party, a secret source he could trust to foll ow his explicit instructions— a source in Berlin, one who was beyond the reach of the Nazis. 43 Albert physically needed the sequestered proxy in h and so he could display it at the board meeting. August 29, late in the day, Lier cabled NY: \"Albert stating third party holding IBM proxy for h im. Desirable proxy handed to him....

The source did not receive the cable until the next Wednesday, September 3. 45 S EPTEMBER 3, 1941 Harrison Chauncey International Business Machines Corporation 590 Madison Ave. New York Dear Chauncey: Your cable of August 29 requesting me to turn over the power of attorney to Dr. Albert has been received and your i nstructions were carried out this morning when I personally handed h im the document in question and gave him your message.

If d evelopments do not move smoothly, there is a possibility that I shall call you on the tele- phone or write you in detail as Dr. Albert advises.

Heidinger lived in Munich. So did Schulte- S t r a t h aus. Dr. Vogt, Heidinger's brother-in -law, lived in Berlin but was in poor health, and not available on such short notice. Arrangements were made for all three unavailable directors to si gn proxies. Each signed on September 16 proxy forms prepared by Hans Mahr, a Dehomag attor- ney. These proxies empowered either Kiep or Ziegler to vote per specified instructions—to generate a stock split. Kiep was lo yal to \"Watson, but the for- mer German consul in New York was still an official of the German Foreign Ministry. The pressure on him was immense. He would have no choice but to vote as instructed on the proxy by Heidinger and hi s clique. There was no chance Kiep could cast his personal vote against re investment in Germany, so he would have to join with the majority. 47 Albert was holding IBM's proxy, conveyed by Woods, but no instruc- tions from Watson. The new German law did not requi re profit taking; it only offered corporations a window to double their divid ends on the condition that more money was reinvested in the Reich. But IB M would have to vote for the stock split for a host of reasons—that seem ed clear. Albert needed a decision—fast. If IBM was isolated by its own board , and voted against Ger- man economic support, it would only seal the view t hat IBM was an enemy of the Hitler regime. Yet, at a time when America was closer than ever to entering the war, Watson was profoundly uncertain how doubling the in vestment would be perceived. If it could appear that the investment w as somehow compulsory, then IBM could simply explain it was required to co mply with the law. Woods could not provide such a statement, since the law was clearly optional. But he was willing to read such a stateme nt from Albert to IBM NY, allowing IBM to transcribe the conversation and in so doing create a record of what appeared to be government coercion. A phone call was arranged. S EPTEMBER 17, 1941, 10 A . M . N EW Y ORK T IME W ATSON : Hello, Mr. Woods. W OODS : Hello, Mr. Watson. I am going to read a message to you from your attorney. This is the message: \"As you know, a special law, enacted June 12, 1941, provides that the divi- dends of any and all companies organized under Germ an law are from now on restricted to six percent. . . . they can, accor ding to certain detailed de- scriptions, increase their share capital out of the ir surplus. This is to be done by the board of directors, not by general [sha reholder] meeting."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Dehomag intends to increase their share capital out of surplus by 100 percent—RM 15,400,000—and will then be entitled to declare six per- c e n t di vi d e n d s on the 15,400,000 Marks which is e quivalent to 12 percent on the original 7,700,000. The obvious advantages o f this are . . . transfer of surplus . . . without shareholders paying well-know n high taxes. . . . This law can practically be considered compulsory. (In o ther words, it is com- pulsory that this be done). . . . I strongly recommen d you send a cable of approval.\" The message was transcribed as coming from Woods an d therefore was en- veloped in the authority of the commercial attache. 48 Joining Watson in the conference call were Nichol a nd Chauncey. Woods was actually excited to speak to Watson himse lf. Indeed, Woods imme- diately had Albert's message typed into a letter to IBM NY, adding, \"It was good to hear your voices and I am looking forward e agerly to seeing you when I pass through New York the next time I am at home.\" 49 In the conversation with Woods, Watson told the att ache he agreed in principle to the stock split, provided the Germans restricted their new stock as well. But IBM could not yet formally authorize i t. Why? General Ruling 11 made it against the law. 50 Complying with General Ruling 11 would take time. Time was something Watson did not have. As America advanced toward the moment it would ente r the war, the Roosevelt Administration had recendy espoused Gener al Ruling 11, an emergency regulation forbidding any financial trans actions with Nazi Ger- many without a special Treasury Department license involving written justifi- cations. Even certain corporate instructions of a f inancial nature were subject to the rule. This was something completely new to c ontend with in IBM's Nazi alliance. IBM would now be required to seek a complicated, bureau- cratic approval for each financial instruction it o rdered for its overseas sub- sidiaries under Nazi control. General Ruling 11 wou ld not affect subsidiaries in neutral countries, such as Sweden or Switzerland . Even still, it would severely hamper all communications with Dehomag its elf, and open a gov- ernment window into many of IBM's complex transacti ons. 51 How much time did IBM have? The board meeting was scheduled in Berlin for late the next day. New York immediately cabled Woods that it approved Albert's recom- mendation to double the investment to RM 15.4 milli on—an increased rein- vestment of about $2 million extra. But there was a condition. The new stock"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"issued to the three Germans must be restricted unde r the existing captive share agreements. That was imperative. 52 Quickly, IBM people had to complete the two-page sw orn affidavit application to authorize the doubling of stock. It needed to be signed by the corporation's secretary-treasurer, John G. Phillips . But he was not available. No time to waste. Someone signed Phillips' name to both lines where it was required, and then dutifully placed their cursive l owercase initials—aer— under the signature to show it was affixed by a per son designated to sign. 53 But Phillips' signature had to be executed and cert ified in the presence of a notary. No problem. Someone found a notary in Que ens. He verified the signatures as genuine, stamped his name and commiss ion number just be- neath the Phillips signature, and then pressed his embossing seal onto the application. A short transcript of Woods' telephone conversation with Watson was attached to prove the urgency of the transactio n. The carefully quoted dialogue fragment included Albert's well-structured explanation that what was really an optional profit-taking regulation \"ca n practically be considered compulsory.\" 54 The application clearly stated that it could only b e presented at the Federal Reserve Bank in Manhattan. But by the time the application was signed and sealed, it was just too late. The Federa l Reserve was closed. Deal- ing with the phlegmatic Fed would be too slow anywa y. Chauncey headed to Washington D.C. He would go over the head of the Fe d, right to Treasury itself. 55 The next morning, September 19, Chauncey appeared a t the Treasury Department. The Dehomag board meeting would soon ge t under way—and IBM would not be there to vote for reinvestment unl ess the license was issued at once. Clearly agitated and pressured, Chauncey d emanded the review officer issue the license to authorize the stock sp lit. 56 When? Right now. But Mr. Rueffer, the review officer at Treasury, wa s in no real hurry. He bureaucratically informed Chauncey that such an app lication would take some time and must first be submitted through prope r channels—namely the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. An impatient Chauncey now became riled. This application was too important, it could not wait. He insisted that if the Treasury license was not rendered at once, IBM' s German affiliate would take its own action in what was \"probably a matter of compulsion.\" 57 Rueffer was not fazed. 58 The matter just could not be done quickly, Take it to New York. Meanwhile, in Berlin, a Dehomag attorney, Hans Mahr , had been called"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"to certify the proper form of the board meeting. Th e session would be held not at Dehomag's headquarters, where a last-minute cable from New York could be received, but at the Hotel Adlon—Watson's favorite. Kiep and Ziegler would be there to vote their proxies as ins tructed by Heidinger. The meeting would convene soon—at 5 P . M . 59 Back in Washington, Chauncey could not wait. He dem anded to see Assistant Secretary J. W. Pehle for faster action. That was not possible. 60 Then could he meet with a senior member of the staf f? 61 One of Mr. Rueffer's supervisors agreed to meet Cha uncey. But the real- ity that the application would have to creep throug h the slow channels of the Federal Reserve Bank was sinking in. In frustration and futility, Chauncey laid out the financial transaction to the superviso r. Surplus money blocked in Germany, RM 7.7 million, would be reinvested in the company, doubling the capital of Dehomag. He stressed that even though IB M NY would be required to approve the recapitalization, no funds would be transferred from the U.S. In fact, the transaction would still leave an additional surplus of RM 10 million. 62 Chauncey added that he had just been to Germany, an d then his story began to wend into all sorts of permutations. The T reasury supervisor recalled that Chauncey \"claims that unless the prop osed change is made, the German authorities will make the change themselves . . . German interests will acquire control of the company.\" 63 In truth, when the stock split was ratified, the pr oportion of ownership would remain identical. The three Germans would sti ll own the same 15 per- cent. The government would not effectuate the split ; that was strictly a busi- ness decision for Dehomag's board. The Treasury sup ervisor remained unconvinced. He noted, \"His [Chauncey's] explanatio n of this was somewhat vague and had to do with present German laws about which he was very uncertain.\" 64 Chauncey was again told by the supervisor that Ruef fer was correct. Under the law, IBM needed to provide a proper detai led explanation of the stock split and file that with the license applicat ion at the Federal Reserve Bank. Knowing that time was running out for some so rt of instruction to Berlin, Chauncey pressed the supervisor for at leas t an opinion. Might such a transaction be approved? It was all speculation. Th e supervisor just could not predict. 65 But it was \"extremely urgent,\" insisted Chauncey. I t didn't matter. Noth- ing he said that day could make the license happen. 66 Time was running out. The vote was about to proceed , and Albert"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"needed to authorize the vote. But Watson could not authorize it. Chauncey could not authorize it. No one at IBM NY would auth orize it without a Trea- sury license. So Sam Woods authorized it. He called Albert and to ld him to proceed. 67 Albert informed Dehomag officials that IBM NY was a uthorizing the stock split and would not challenge the reinvestmen t. In a brief corporate event, Kiep and Ziegler assembled at Berlin's Hotel Adlon at 5 P.M. Kiep officially opened the meeting and stated the sole a genda item. He and Ziaegler verbally agreed in the presence of attorne y Mahr, who certified every procedural step of the two men. The stock was split . 68 Watson must have been furious. For decades, IBM had tiptoed through the serpentine regulations of seventy countries—whe ther at war, in peace, or anything in between. From Fascist states to revolut ionary regimes, the com- pany had always managed to avoid legal infractions of any kind. Now it appeared that General Ruling 11 had been violated. General Ruling 11 was essentially a precursor to Trading with the Enemy r egulations. It was more than important. Moreover, Chauncey's name was on th e proxy that effected the transaction. Everyone began explaining themselv es in carefully worded memos and letters. Albert wrote to Chauncey on October 9, \"It is true that Mr. Watson stated he would send me a cable immediately authori zing such procedure and that I have not received such a cable; on the c ontrary, I have been informed that this cable . . . could not be sent du e to the fact that IBM have not yet received license from Treasury Department. ... I have not waited . . . but had informed the Dehomag . . . that they were a uthorized to go ahead.\" In so doing, Albert added, he was able to show IBM' s willingness to cooper- ate in the German economy. In consequence, \"everyth ing had been amicably settled,\" he continued, which allowed more objectio nable decisions by the board to be avoided. \"I took the responsibility of approval upon myself.\" 69 Understanding that Chauncey might have to answer to the Treasury Department, Albert's apologia went on, \"I hope you do not get into difficul- ties with your [Treasury] Department. They will cer tainly understand.... For obvious reasons, I am not sending any more particul ars than are already in IBM's hands.\" 70 That same day, October 9, IBM's Werner Lier wrote a formal four-page letter to Watson explaining events. He had gone ove r the complete file in Albert's office. \"I noted therefrom the decision ta ken by Dr. Albert, upon advice of Mr. Woods, to increase the capital by 100 percent.... [But] we wish to remind you in this connection of Mr. Woods' tele phone call . . . and from"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"which he deducted [sic] your agreement.\" Lier decla red the urgent move was required \"to avoid a precedent of Dehomag overstepp ing the prerogatives of the IBM.\" 71 IBM couldn't be sure what to do. Its license applic ation was slowly per- colating through the Federal Reserve Bank and the T reasury Department. A series of formal letters and cables began papering the files reflecting official IBM non-authorization. On September 26, a week afte r the stock was split, IBM cabled Woods at the Embassy: \"Regret we have no t been able [to] cable you in response your telephone message due to [the] fact that we have not yet received license from Treasury.\" 72 The Embassy was surely confused because shortly the reafter it sent back a message for clarification. A week later, Cha uncey replied to the Embassy, \"Re: your cable of September 29, represent ative may not act in absence of license ... and permission requested the refore is denied.\" 73 General Ruling 11 would make it impossible for IBM to continue doing business in the freewheeling cross-border fashion i t was accustomed to. The company could not wait weeks for every instruction to be approved by the Treasury Department. Indeed, just after Dehomag dou bled the capitalization, two of Watson's confidants were to meet with Lier f rom IBM Geneva, undoubtedly to discuss how to deploy the additional investment. That would only further the appearance of IBM ratification. On September 22, the Embassy cabled Chauncey one of many cryptic message s: \"Your two friends wish Swiss representative to meet Dehomag people. D o you agree?\" 74 Chauncey tried to stop Lier from traveling from IBM Geneva to Ger- many. An immediate cable was sent to the Geneva off ice. But it was too late. The office replied, \"Already en route. Left Saturda y morning. Tried reach him border without success. . . . Only Bachofen [Lier's assistant] can reach him safe discreet way.\" Lier arrived in Berlin anyway a nd began working on vital Dehomag projects such as moving Dehomag machines fr om Poland into Romania where they were urgendy needed for a census . 75 On October 9, 1941, Milner in the New York office s ent a memorandum to Chauncey regarding \"Shipment of Dehomag Machines to Various Coun- tries.\" Milner worried that it might have become to o difficult to continue business as usual with the Hitler regime. \"As you k now, on June 15, 1941 we cabled the Geneva office regarding the President's [Franklin D. Roosevelt's] proclamation, and instructed them not to make any m ove involving IBM assets without securing advice from the American Co nsulate. This was to avoid their unintentionally violating any provision of the President's decree.

T h i s , of course, is a serious step, as some of the countries are using Dehomag machines and curren tly require repair parts. It might be well for us to discuss this subj ect at your convenience.\" 76 IBM would not place a stop on any of its Dehomag bu siness, or any subsidiary's interaction with it. IBM filed another request with the Treasury Department, this time to send an instruction to all of its European sub- sidiaries and agencies, as well, as its divisions i n Japan. The instruction: \"In view of world conditions we cannot participate in t he affairs of our compa- nies in various countries as we did in normal times . Therefore you are advised that you will have to make your own decisio ns and not call on us for any advice or assistance until further notice.\" It was sent to the State Depart- ment on October 10, 1941, with a request for commen t. 77 A State Department official replied some two weeks later, \"While this Department is glad to be informed of your intention s in this matter, it has no specific comment to make at this time.\" To this perfunctory response, Chauncey very cautiously answered, \"Thank you very much for your letter of October 23, 1941.\" 78 IBM's cable to all subsidiaries involved with Axis nations was approved. Watson's October 1941 instruction did not order his subsidiaries to stop pro- ducing punch cards for Nazi Germany. It did not ord er them to cease all operations. It did not set limits on which projects they could participate in. It did not require offices in neutral countries to sto p supporting Hitler's pro- gram. It did not proscribe uses in census or regist ration operations. It did not even demand that spare parts no longer be sent to m achines in concentration camps. All that business continued. The cable merel y directed managers not to \"call on us for any advice or assistance until f urther notice.\" On October 21, 1941, the Treasury Department finall y issued IBM a license to communicate the authorization to split t he stock—more than a month after the fact. 79 A week later, long after IBM submitted its license to instruct all subsidiaries to stop communicating, Ch auncey spoke again to Commercial Attache Woods.

In one such crisis, Heidinger was w aging yet another voting putsch. On December 3, as America sensed it stood a t the brink of war, a clearly nervous Chauncey again appeared at the Stat e Department with yet another emergency message to be conveyed to Berlin. Mr. Luthringer was the officer on duty. Chauncey gave his IBM business card to the clerk. The card had no address, title, or phone number on it, just the imprint \"Harrison K.

Luthringer agreed to see him. 82 Chauncey was carrying a message, and again there wa s no time to secure a Treasury License. Would the State Departme nt object to sending it?

More than 140,000 Jews, as well as thousands of refugees from Nazism, lived in Holland on the day of invasion. 1 France fell a month later. After the June 1940 armi stice, France was divided into two zones. A so-called Occupied Zo ne in the north, which included Paris, was ruled by a German military gover- nor backed up by the army and Himmler's Gestapo uni ts. In the south, a collaborationist regime was popularly refe rred to as Vichy France, after the town of Vichy where the governmen t was head- quartered. Alsace-Lorraine was annexed. Approximate ly 300,000 Jews lived in all of France prior to occupation and dismemberment. About 200,000 of those lived in the Paris area. 2 German intentions in both countries were nearly ide ntical and unfolded in a similar sequence throughout the war y ears. But every- thing about the occupation of these lands and their involvement with Hitler's Holleriths was very different. For th e Jews of these two nations, their destinies would also be quite di fferent. Germany frequently exploited ethnic antagonism betw een national groups in Eastern Europe and ignited long simmering anti- Semitism with Fascist surrogates in such lands as Y ugoslavia, Slo- vakia, Romania, and Hungary. Jews in Eastern Europe often lived"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"apart from the larger society and were subject to c lass resentment exacer- bated by religious isolation. By clever manipulatio n, the Third Reich was able to divide and conquer democratic or monarchica l sovereignties, and then enlist the aid of local Jew-haters to legislat e and regiment the methodi- cal destruction of the Jewish community. But it was different in France and Holland. In the Netherlands, the population was, with notabl e exceptions, funda- mentally homogeneous. Certainly, traditional Portuguese, colonial, and recent refugee groups each occupied their own niche . Ethnic rivalries, how- ever, were largely non-existent and could not be ex ploited. Dutch Jews ma i n t a i n e d a closely knit community. Only some 12,4 00 (less than 10 per- cent) did not affiliate with either of the two lead ing Jewish ancestral groups. Less than an estimated 2,000 had drifted into Chris tianity. But Dutch Jews were nonetheless almost completely integrated. Jews could be found among the leaders of literature, jurisprudence, physics, medicine, and manufactur- ing. Jewish organizations were secularized. Interma rriage was common. By 1930, some 41 percent of the community was in a mix ed marriage. Dutch Jewry lived in harmony and acceptance as productive citizens of Holland. 3 France was ethnically diverse, weaving Jews, Christ ians, and Moslems from across Europe, Asia, and Africa into the fabri c of French society. Cer- tainly, strong racial and religious undercurrents c ontinuously rippled, and sometimes exploded. Anti-Semitism had been a fact o f life in France for generations—as it had been throughout Europe. The t erm J'Accuse was born amidst the outrage over the Dreyfus Affair. Yet the French had by and large learned to live with ethnic diversity as a strength of their national culture. French Jewry was as completely assimilated as many of their coreligionists in Germany. Jews in France achieved prominence in scie nce, the arts, and poli- tics. France cherished her Jewish painters Pissaro, Chagall, and Modigliani. Theatergoers loved Sarah Bernhardt. Men of letters such as Marcel Proust and Henri Bergson enjoyed wide followings. In 1936, Leon Blum became the first Jew elected premier. Yet Talmudic studies all but disappeared. Bap- tized or unaffiliated Jews were commonly found thro ughout a Jewish com- munity that considered itself French first. 4 In Holland, punch cards were a well-developed stati stical tool. As early as 1916, the Central Statistical Bureau began track ing import and export data on Hollerith machines purchased from an agent for t he German company. By 1923, Dutch industry was adopting the technology. T he Amsterdam City Electricity Works became the first public utility i n the world to use an actual punch card as a regular customer bill. After two Du tch statisticians visited"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Berlin for demonstrations, the Netherlands chose Ho llerith machines to tab- ulate its 1930 census. By 1937, a centralized \"mach ine park\" was developed to serve a multiplicity of government clients. To s ave money, the Dutch gov- ernment integrated some locally produced punchers m anufactured by Kamatec and Kamadex. 5 \"Watson established a card printing plant in the Ne therlands in 1936. In 1939, IBM located a training school in Amsterdam fo r its European sales force. By that time, the Netherlands was preparing for wartime disruptions by inventorying all sources and stores of the nation's food stocks. Ration cards were regularly issued to all civilians. All informa tion was punched onto cards and sorted by IBM equipment. 6 From the outbreak of World War II, Holland standard ized on IBM de- vices. By 1941, the Ministry of Agriculture alone o perated 40 machines, which used 1 million Hollerith cards monthly, continuousl y punched by a staff of 120 punching secretaries. The Statistical Bureau of the Ministry of Economics utilized 98 IBM machines. The Central Statistical B ureau's usage had em- ployed 64 machines. All tolled, the Dutch federal g overnment leased 326 ma- chines from IBM, with an additional 176 Holleriths located in 21 provincial offices, municipal bureaus, and semi-official agenc ies. Fifteen key corpora- tions used 169 machines. More than 320 machines wer e employed by non- essential private enterprises. Having surpassed its own card printing needs, by 1941, IBM NY was annually shipping Holland 132 m illion cards printed in America. Unquestionably, Holland automated its d ata with Holleriths. 7 Ironically, IBM did not operate a subsidiary in Hol land throughout the twenties and thirties. The company relied upon high ly paid sales agents to close deals. Dehomag in conjunction with IBM Geneva supplied the equip- ment and expertise. Watson had opened new subsidiar ies in Poland and other conquered territories just before or after the Germ ans invaded. It was no different in Holland. On March 20, 1940, just as Hi tler was preparing to launch his spring invasions of the Low Countries and Weste rn Europe, Watson rushed to incorporate Watson Bedrijfsmachine Maatsc happij N.V.—the Dutch name for Watson Business Machines Corporation. Reic h armies took Den- mark on April 9, Norway on May 2, and Luxembourg on May 10. On May 10, Germany also launched its conquest of Holland—it on ly took five days. 8 Throughout the spring invasions, the flow of punch cards to Holland was uninterrupted. Just before the war came to the Netherlands' border, IBM approved an agreement with the Central Statisti cal Bureau to supply enough cards to last a year. When the Germans enter ed Holland, they took possession of that supply. 9 "},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"When originally incorporated in March 1940, two own ers of Watson Bedrijfsmachine were listed. I B M NY was shown ownin g 90 percent of the Dutch company, with 10 percent held by J. W. Schott e, General Manager of IBM Kurope. Although a mere nominee, Schotte's shar es created the appear- ance of a Dutch national as principal. Even though Schotte lived in New York, IBM initially listed him as general manager o f the Dutch subsidiary. Quickly, however, IBM NY decided to vest all real p ower in another manager named Pieter van Ommeren. Since by that time the Ne therlands was occu- pied, IBM's secretary-treasurer, J. G. Phillips, on September 17, wrote to the Netherlands Consulate General in exile for permissi on to circumvent the rules of incorporation. Phillips' sworn letters to the Consulate never identi- fied Schotte as IBM's European General Manager in N ew York, but merely as a Dutch \"merchant\" who was \"sojourning in the Unite d States.\" 10 Some months later, on December 7, 1940, as part of Watson's move to create the appearance of non-communication and reas sure Nazi occupiers of non-control, van Ommeren filed an unusual amendment to the articles of incorporation. This amendment deleted the standard clause of closely held corporations to facilitate communications. The word s \"by telegraph\" were removed from the phrase \"Shareholders can be consul ted in lieu of meeting by writing or telegraph.\" From December 1940 to mid -June 1941, IBM exec- utives undertook the protracted legal applications to ensure that the exiled Dutch consulate approved the power of attorney give n to Ommeren. 11 IBM wanted to make sure that all of its corporate acts in Holland were recognized not only by the Nazi civil administration, but the exiled government as well. IBM's operation in France was \"promising\"—but from the first years, a small and fragmented market. In 1919, CTR establish ed its first European sales office in Paris, using Heidinger's original D ehomag as sales agent. With only a dozen French customers, IBM France, in 1925, opened a manufactur- ing factory and a branch in Lyon. As late as 1927, IBM was fighting a pitched b attl e with rival Powers Company for the small Fren ch market. Each firm had snared just 30 customers using approximately 50 sor ters and tabulators fed by about 300 punching stations. Then in 1931, the S wiss company, Bull, appeared in France with a new low-cost integrated m achine that seemed to outperform the Hollerith. Bull's first installation was at the French Ministry of Labor. 12 Even though Bull enjoyed but a single client in 193 1, Watson saw the new company as a significant threat. IBM ramped up its competitive machin- ery to neutralize the new firm. Watson personally i nspected Bull machines at French government offices with an eye toward buying the company outright."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"At about that time, IBM signed up the French Minist ry of War which would become a major client for complex Hollerith systems . By 1932, IBM France had expanded to more than sixty-five customers. Pro tracted discussions between Watson and French Bull owners broke down. S o IBM purchased the original Bull rights in Switzerland, this to the sh ock of French Bull. Immedi- ately after closing the deal, Watson went further, hiring Emile Genon, the very Bull manager who had sold IBM the Swiss rights . French Bull voted to dishonor the contract as anti-competitive and even moved to separate from its Swiss sister company. The serpentine Bull acqui sition controversy led to years of lawsuits in Switzerland and France as IBM challenged Bull's right to sell its own designs, and Bull sued for unfair comp etition. 13 Watson restructured his French organization in 1936 , creating a new subsidiary named Compagnie Electro-Comptable de Fra nce, or CEC. By the outbreak of war, CEC had hundreds of machines insta lled, many of them concentrated in just three sectors: banking, railro ad, and the military. IBM now dominated the French market with about 65 perce nt of usage in France proper, and virtually the entire market in France's colonies, especially North Africa and Indochina. Bull, beset by financial prob lems, undoubtedly linked to its endless litigation with IBM, secured only 25 percent of the French mar- ket share, mainly among governmental and banking cl ients. Powers clung to its marginal 10 percent segment. 14 As France edged closer to war in the late thirties, French War Ministry orders greatly exceeded CEC's limited factory outpu t. From 1937, excess French military orders were placed directly with IB M NY. In the approxi- mately two years before war erupted in 1939, IBM NY shipped the French military alphabetizes yielding nearly a half millio n dollars in rentals, as well as $350,000 in spare parts. All of France utilized some 426 million punch cards in those two pre-war years; they were printed locally, ordered from other European subsidiaries, or imported from the U .S. 25 But everything changed in French automation when th e country was partitioned in June 1940. The Franco-German June ar mistice was signed less than three weeks after Watson returned Hitler' s decoration. Dehomag's revolt was in its initial tempest state. Nazi force s immediately seized hun- dreds of CEC Holleriths. A special \"requisitioning\" platoon familiar with IBM tabulators was attached to the First Panzer Div ision to effect the con- fiscation. Machines were carted off from CEC's ware house and workshops, and even removed from CEC's customers, such as the electric company in Strasbourg and a gamut of armament firms. The large st collection of Hol-"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"leriths was swept from France's War Ministry, espec ially the Ministry's tabula- tor service.\"' In all, 319 Holleriths were commandeered, spirited out of France, and dispersed to waiting Reich customers throughout Ger many, Dozens of verifi- ers, sorters, and alphabetizes were placed at the M aschinelles Berichtwesen and its many punch card field offices throughout co nquered Europe. Many of the devices were assigned to key German war industr y companies. Some were deployed at Nazi occupation offices in Krakow and Prague. The largest group of Holleriths was transported to Luftwaffe ba ses and the German High Command. 17 CEC officials logged each machine by original clien t location, serial number, and leasing valuation so CEC could make a c laim in Berlin for pay- ment. These logs were sent to IBM NY for review as soon as they became available. Likewise, German authorities kept meticu lous records of each of the 319 requisitioned machines by original site, mo nthly leasing cost, and new location within Nazi Europe. Although the machi nes at first were for- cibly removed, IBM actually found the action conduc ive to better relations with the Reich and quite profitable. CEC managers b illed the Reich for each machine, and company representatives squabbled with the authorities over precisely how much would be paid for each device. I n the fourth quarter of 1942 alone, the German Army paid CEC 9.4 million Fr ench francs—equal to about $100,000—for leasing, service, spare parts, a nd punch cards. 18 Quickly, CEC's profits soared. Volume doubled from 1939 to 1942 to FF101 million for 1942. During that same period pro fits almost quadrupled to FF26.6 million in 1942, of which FF16.3 mi l l i o n was designated \"royal- ties.\" Those monies were derived almost entirely fr om orders placed by Dehomag and German agencies. For example, the 250 s orters manufactured by CEC in 1942—double the 1938 output—were all orde red by Dehomag. What domestic activity CEC did undertake was genera lly some miscel- laneous card printing and reconditioning of the old est machines not yet requisitioned. 19 Clearly, CEC had been converted into a captive supp ly source for Dehomag. This was done with IBM NY's full concurren ce. In fact, to meet Dehomag's increasing demand, Watson in 1941 approve d the construction of two new factory sites. One plant was added to the m anufacturing complex at Vincennes, outside of Paris. A second factory compo und was erected at Essonnes, twenty miles south of Paris, not far from rail facilities. A March 24. 1941, report from CEC management to IBM NY explaine d, \"The equipment"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"demanned by our customers... has caused that the ca pacity of our present factory at Vincennes was bound to be exceeded very rapidly.\" Until the new factory was completed, CEC would use o u t s i d e \"jobbe rs\" to supply parts. 20 IBM NY was continuously kept informed about CEC's p rogress by a variety of formal and informal means. Sometimes, it was just a handwritten letter, such as the one written in English to a man ufacturing executive at Endicott by Dehomag engineer Oskar Hoermann. Hoerma nn was a principal IBM liaison between the German company, the MB in B erlin, and CEC. L YON , F RANCE April 30, 1942 Dear Jimmy, I am on a business trip in the unoccupied France an d take this opportunity of giving a sign of myself. I am not in the army yet, since we have become increasingly important. Even C.E.C. Paris works for us now. We opened up a small assembly plant in Kuchen, 50 miles from Sindelfmgen, and will soon open up another little p lant about 100 miles away. Not because we think it wise to decentr alize, but because we have to move our work where we have workers avai lable. Once in a while I go to Paris.

Hoermann 21 IBM Endicott's executive offices received Hoermann' s handwritten let- ter July 20, 1942, in the morning mail. 22 But most reports to Watson were far more detailed. For example, in early 1943, more than a year after the U.S. entered World War II, IBM NY received CEC's regular quarterly financial report f or the fourth quarter of 1942. The thirty-two-page, single-spaced report sum marized in great detail, and illustrated with numerous tables, all the fisca l pluses and minuses of CEC's business with Germany.

Sp e c i a l notes attribute d FF9.4 million, or about $100,00, \"paid by the German Army for rental of req uisitioned machines.\" CEC managers were careful to include detailed chart s of how the sub- sidiary's performance measured up against its assig ned profit quota—a point system—established by IBM NY. 23 Sales and expenses were analyzed by financial quart er and product. Competitor activities at Bull and Powers were summa rized for both the Occupied Zone and Vichy. Line items were entered fo r maintenance on the machines used by the German High Command, FF304,059 , plus an extra adjustment of FF3.79 million for yet another catego ry of machines and main- tenance provided to the German High Command. 24 CEC's report also emphasized France's dire paper sh ortages. The Nazis had temporarily authorized a Dehomag paper vendor t o supply CEC, but that permission had ended because of Europe's gener al scarcity. \"The out- look was very dark,\" CEC's report confessed, adding , \"we tried to obtain paper by all available means.\" By scrounging from s ource to source, CEC hoped it could persevere a few weeks at a time. Amo ng its precious remain- ing stock of 262 rolls was a cache of 93 rolls from IBM NY. 25 Symptomatic of the paper scarcity, CEC reported, wa s the summer 1942 crisis at Mandeure, the French subsidiary's on e remaining paper sup- plier. Mandeure warned CEC that it could not supply further paper for punch cards without additional shipments of the vit al coal and cellulose it needed for pulping. Claiming an emergency, CEC was able to intervene with Nazi rationing authorities, \"pressing them for an a llotment of coal and cellu- lose to 'Mandeure'.... This allows us,\" reported CE C, \"to live under the most drastic restrictions which we imposed on our custom ers.\" But by the end of 1942, even CEC's compromise alternative suppliers w ere being exhausted. 26 Yet CEC could only hope profits would continue to r ise based on increased machine orders for the Reich supplemented by ancillary punch card services. CEC's 1942 report itemized for IBM N Y a wealth of Dehomag orders aggressively being filled despite wartime co nditions. Order #52769 for 50 collators would commence shortly with five m achines monthly. Order #'55158 for an additional 100 collators would be sc heduled as soon as raw materials permitted. Order #52768 for 50,000 sortin g brushes would be satisfied with 5,000 per month. 27 In addition, CEC's report listed its crucial traini ng courses for punch card operators. Course #10B enrolled 45 keypunch st udents. Course 11B enrolled an additional 45 students. Course #12B tau ght 36 students.

CEC was not only churning out machines and punch ca rds, but also s ki l l e d operators to make them work for Germany. To further expand its market, CEC was aggressively serving clients in France's colonial territories now controlled by Vic hy. Of CEC's 848 em- ployees, 5 worked at CEC offices in Algeria, 5 in C asablanca, and 3 in Indochina. 29 CEC had become a veritable satellite of Dehomag. Th e subsidiary maintained a direct link to the Nazi Party. Althoug h Watson's director gen- eral was Roger Virgile, the Nazis had appointed one of their own men, a Dehomag agent named Heinz Westerholt, to act as CEC 's Kommissar. Wester- holt was more than a Dehomag employee. He joined th e NSDAP (Nazi Party) on May 1, 1933, shortly after Hitler assumed power; the Party issued him membership #2,781,981. Later that year, Westerholt was inducted into the SS, which issued him identification #272,239. In Oc tober 1934, Westerholt became a management employee of Dehomag. 30 IBM NY was aware of Westerholt and his Party connec tions from the outset. Westerholt first became active in CEC's bus iness when he visited Paris in summer 1940 during the Nazi effort to crea te a punch card cartel. Chauncey kept tabs on Westerholt by a combination o f rumors and reports relayed through IBM Geneva, and remained in constan t contact with CEC, as well as Otto Kiep and attorney Albert in Berlin. Chauncey clearly identi- fied Westerholt to New York as the Dehomag agent wi th Nazi Party status who was deployed to undermine IBM's interest in Par is. For his part, Wester- holt was among those incensed at Watson for slighti ng der Fuhrer. At one point, Westerholt openly repeated Dehomag's prevail ing view: Watson's opin- ions were \"not of great importance\" because he had returned Hitler's medal. 31 But cooperation with the Third Reich was imperative for Watson. The recurring crisis of IBM retaining its dominance in Axis punch card opera- tions was again peaking in fall 1941. The urge to c reate a German-controlled cartel was again confronting IBM NY. In that vein, the Reich began to view CEC as one of a geographical triad of IBM subsidiar ies along with Beige Watson in Brussels and Watson Bedrijfsmachine Maats chappi in Amsterdam. The director of Beige Watson was former Bull Direct or Emile Genon. The director of CEC was Roger Virgile. P. Taylor wa s Watson's trouble-"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"shooter in IBM Geneva. In September 1941, Cenon wro te a confidential let- ter to Taylor at IBM Geneva discussing Watsons inte ntions for CEC. A copy of Genon's letter ended up in the hands of Justice Department investigators looking into IBM's many special Treasury licenses. The Justice Department and State Department summarized the letter: \"Politi cal affairs in France. Transmits copies of letter addressed to Mr. P. Tayl or, International Business Machines Corporation and written by E. Genon, which indicates that Mr. T.H.J. Watson approved Mr. Virgile's policy of coll aboration with Germany.\" 32 In France, IBM's collaboration required working wit h the SS via West- erholt. Indeed, IBM NY suspected that when America entered the war, West- erholt might be designated custodian of CEC, since he had poignandy discussed the issue of enemy receivership with Virg ile. In the second week of October 1941, Westerholt returned to Paris for furt her consultations with Virgile. Westerholt met Virgile on October 13, when he warned that Deho- mag was now prepared to break its contract with IBM NY on a legal \"pre- text.\" The German authorities understood that Bull lacked the manufacturing muscle to supply the Reich, but Berlin still hoped it could use Bull designs and patents to start its own factory. Toward that a im, license agreements had already been signed. In view of the threat to IBM E urope if the company did not cooperate, Westerholt wanted an immediate meeti ng at Lyon in Vichy. He sent word to Werner C. Lier, Watson's most senior o fficial at IBM Geneva. 33 While Lier considered Westerholt's invitation, he f iled a full report with IBM NY. In his note, Lier warned that if the U.S. e ntered the war, as most imminently expected, a custodian for CEC would \"hav e the effect of reduc- ing the amount of reports which we have been able t o receive from CEC . . . and create a situation somewhat similar to that of the Dehomag.\" That in mind, Lier needed New York's permission to attend a nd bring CEC Sales Manager William Borel as Virgile's representative. 34 Three days later on October 16, an impatient Lier c abled IBM NY: \"Competition affair serious. Genon learned Vichy . . . definitely able destroy our European business in cooperation with foreign g roup, previously men- tioned. . . . Following telephone call Borel I rece ived today written report stating Westerholt confirmed Virgile reality our fe ars. . . . Also threatened appointment foreign custodian Paris with program su ppressing relations with Geneva. Westerholt wants see me Lyon. . . . Will se e him only with your ap- proval. Please instruct all matters.\" 35 The next day, Lier contacted Berlin to obtain the l atest intelligence on Dehomag's rebellious actions. He summarized the eff ort for New York. \"Due to the courtesy of the American Consulate in Geneva ,\" Lier reported, \"it was"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"possible for us to speak on the morning of October 17th to the United States Embassy in Berlin. Mr. Woods, the Commercial Attach e, being absent, we explained to his assistant our desire to find out s omething more definite con- cerning Dehomag's intention of breaking the contrac t with us. In the after- noon Mr. Woods called us in Geneva and told us that he had seen Dr. Albert who had admitted, though in a rather vague manner, that he had heard cer- tain rumors about Dehomag's intention but . . . cou ld not give a definite opinion as to the legal aspects of the matter.\" 36 Thereafter, Lier concluded that a meeting with \"Wes terholt could no longer be postponed. Lier cabled New York, \"Recab [ re: cable] competition. Intend go Vichy with Genon Wednesday trying prevent or slowing juridical materialization agreement between two groups.\" On O ctober 20, IBM NY replied, \"No objection your seeing Westerholt. Make no commitments and take no action.\" Lier confirmed that he would immed iately leave for Lyon because it was \"in the best interests of the IBM to delay as much as possible the official ratification of the agreement between the Bull and W [Wanderer- Werke] groups.\" 37 The initial meeting between Lier and Westerholt was only the begin- ning. The Nazis wanted a second, much broader confe rence, this one in Berlin, and involving CEC's entire senior staff. Ag ain, Lier would not pro- ceed without Watson's specific permission. On Novem ber 17, 1941, CEC cabled IBM NY: \"Meeting Berlin November 21 with Vir gile Westerholt . . . Suggest you instruct Lier at once to attend that me eting even if you have not reached decision on Kiep's cable November 6 to Wats on. Have met Wester- holt with Lier. Impression good. Reports follow.\" 38 The meetings with Westerholt in Berlin were part of the constellation of intrigues that compelled Chauncey to rush to the St ate Department in early December, just days before Pearl Harbor, to circumv ent Treasury license requirements and issue financial instructions to De homag. Ultimately, after the U.S. joined the war against Germany, Westerholt was appointed the cus- todian of CEC. 39 The Nazis were able to do with CEC as they pleased so long as IBM was paid. The looming competition with Bull never came to fruition. It was more of a bargaining chip than a genuine threat. Unable to replace IBM, the Third Reich pressured the company into relinquishing Wat- son's troublesome micro-managing in favor of the fa ster and more coordi- nated action the Reich required. But even though CEC and IBM were able to retain the ir dominance as a vital supplier of Reich automation, by the end of 1943, the bleak facts about the punch card business in France had become undeniable. CEC"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"could no longer obtain reliable supplies of paper o r raw materials. IBM's subs i d i a r y no longer produced machines for the Fren ch market Key workers with s p e c i a l Hollerith skills were being systematic ally drafted or transferred to punch card projects in the Greater Reich. The Fr ench company's entire manufacturing capacity—machines and parts—was being shipped out of the country to Germany and beyond. Despite its soaring revenues, the French subsidiary saw a moment of utter corporate collapse looming in the near future. 40 In the beginning of 1943, just as CEC was reportin g doubled vol- umes and trebled profits, Virgile was compelled to warn IBM NY: \"The situa- tion of CEC at the end of 1942 is very precarious, both from the point of view of specialized personnel, which is subject to forced transfer to Germany at any moment, and from the point of view of card s upply which is assured for only a few weeks. Manufacture is proceeding wit h enormous and ever increasing delays. Subcontractors have had to close down suddenly or dec r e a s e their activity sharply as a result of pers onnel requisitions. The greater part of our skilled labor is subject to imm ediate call. Under those conditions, it is impossible to venture as much as a guess as to the future.\" 41 Powers had been all but marginalized in France. The Germans were required to transfer workshops from Germany to Pari s just to keep its almost inactive operation functioning. Even though Bull ha d promising equipment with numerous installations in France, it was finan cially and operationally incapable of ramping up. Some Bull machines had als o been removed by the Germans and were being serviced by IBM personnel in occupied territories. Bull was also desperate for raw materials to fabric ate machines and paper to manufacture cards. Berlin's one and only order for leased Bull machines had to be canceled before any could be delivered. 42 Germany wanted the Jews identified by bloodline not religion, pauper- ized, and then deported to camps, just as they were elsewhere in conquered Europe. The Jews of France stood vulnerable under t he shadow of destruc- tion. Hitler was ready. In France, the Holleriths were not. H OLLAND SURRENDERED to Germany on May 15, 1940, after just five days of fierce attack. The Reich immediately began plann ing the complete de- struction of the Dutch Jewish community. Believing that the total of ancestral and practicing Jews in Holland to be about double t heir actual number, Nazi experts assumed the campaign against Dutch Jewry wo uld be phased. More than that, they realized all too well that the loca l population did not welcome"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"the arrival of Hitler's forces. Certainly, rabid Du tch Nazis were eager to coop- erate with the occupation. But in significant measu re, at times citizens of Hol- land demonstrated open solidarity w i t h persecuted J ews and displayed an unwillingness to deliver their neighbors. Repressiv e measures against Jews provoked a strike by laborers, frequent demands by Christians to be in- cluded with the Jews in their misery, and even some violent riots. 43 The Reich needed a very special expert to help to e ngineer the round- ups. They needed a man who understood the administr ative statistical land- scape of Holland, one who was adept at Hollerith te chnology and willing to cooperate in the face of popular resistance. In an occupied nation beset by neighborhood ambushes against German soldiers, outr ageous catcalls at the cinema when Nazi propaganda films flashed onto the screen, and coordi- nated sermons in churches everywhere to condemn ant i-Semitism, Berlin needed someone uniquely qualified to step forward. 44 They found their man in Jacobus Lambertus Lentz. He was not a Nazi. Those who have studied him have not proven his inna te anti-Semitism. Instead, Lentz was a population expert, cocooned in his own stacked and tabulated world of ratios, registration programs, a nd rattling Hollerith machines. Perfection in human cataloging was for Le ntz more than a matter of pride, it was a crusade. 45 In 1936, as Inspector of Population Registries, Len tz standardized local population registers and their data collection meth odology throughout the Netherlands—an administrative feat that earned him a royal decoration. That same year, he outlined his personal vision in Allge meines Statistisches Archiv, the journal of the German Statistical Society: \"The oretically,\" predicted Lentz, \"the collection of data for each person can be so abundant and com- plete, that we can finally speak of a paper human r epresenting the natural human.\" 46 One can only imagine the deep inner satisfaction Le ntz derived from indexing one segment of the population after anothe r with infallible preci- sion. He bragged about his data, defensively stood by his summaries and always anticipated the next German request for Jewi sh names—if for no other reason than to self-validate his own \"censual \" foresight. When light streamed through the punch card, Lentz surely saw s omething no one else could. German occupiers were resented nearly everyw here in Holland. But for Lentz, his new Nazi masters had in fact liberat ed him from the dissatis- fying ennui of peacetime social tracking. Now, unde r Nazism, he could unleash all his ideas of registration and powers of ratiocination restlessly waiting to be tested. He would declare war on popul ation ambiguity. Lentz"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"would be the man to deliver the Jews of Holland. Hi s motto was \"to record is to serve.\" 47 Step one, on July 3, 1941, was the identification o f Jewish refugees living in Amsterdam, a number the Germans erroneous ly believed was between 120,000 and 150,000. Using police stations normally charged with registering aliens, Lentz organized a systematic co unt. His numbers ulti- mately showed far fewer refugees than expected, abo ut 20,000. 48 Then, on August 17, Lentz devised a unique tamper-p roof personal identification card that could not be forged. Trans lucent inks were employed to print key words that disappeared under a quartz lamp. The stamp franking was acetone-soluble. Photos of the individual were affixed front and back through a window transparently sealed and adhered w ith permanent glue. A fingerprint of the person's right index finger was then impressed upon the back of one of the photos so it always displayed th rough the small window. The individual's signature on watermarked paper com pleted the document, which included numerous personal details. Lentz' ca rd was a masterpiece of human documentation. 49 Lentz first conceived his complex card in 1939 when war in Europe broke out and the government considered foolproof f ood rationing cards. However, as recendy as March 1940, a Dutch governme nt commission thought that such a card would treat average people like criminals, and was inconsistent with the nation's democratic tradition . But with no one to hold him back, Lentz perfected his original card idea by adding the photograph and fingerprint features. 50 When Lentz offered his specimen to the Criminal Tec hnology Institute of the Reich Criminal Police Office, it was eagerly approved. His innovation outshone anything the German police had ever develo ped, and clearly could defeat the many local attempts to forge papers. Wit hin weeks, German civil administrators began requiring all Dutch citizens o ver the age of fourteen to sign up. It took about a year before everyone was r egistered. But Lentz' per- sonal card was more than just an advanced domestic identification. A second portion detached at issuance created a card-like re ceipt. Those card receipts were retained and organized into massive files cata loging the personal details of all who lived in the Netherlands. 51 Every Dutch adult was required to carry Lentz' pers onal identification card. But a feature was added that only affected Je ws. Eventually the letter J was stamped on every identification card carried by those defined as Jewish. The manual card file receipts became the first step ping-stone toward com- prehensive automated Dutch Jewish registration. 52 "},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"On October 22, all Jewish enterprises were compelle d to register. Jews were defined, as in the Nuremberg Laws, according t o their grandparents, not their current religious affiliation. Businesses were deemed Jewish if any member of the ownership or management was Jewish or had Jewish ances- tors, again mimicking the decrees espoused earlier in the Reich. A Bureau of Economic Investigation was formed to decide whether suspect companies were actually Jewish under rigid ancestral definiti ons. As soon as German civil authorities in Holland announced the Jewish c ommercial registration. the nation erupted in protest. Virtually all Protes tant churches, that next Sunday, condemned from the pulpit a Jewish registra tion they called \"un- Christian.\" 53 By early 1941, the Germans felt they were ready to begin the last phase before deportation. On January 10, 1941, Nazi State Secretary Friedrich Wimmer issued the all-important decree V06/41 requi ring all Jews—Dutch and foreign—to register at their local Census Offic e. Wimmer's deadline was four weeks for those residing outside of Amsterdam and ten weeks for Amsterdam residents. Since the 1930 census, Dutch C ensus Offices were completely automated with Hollerith systems. By com paring the Jewish reg- istrations to the existing total population card in dex created by the Lentz card, the authorities could pinpoint any Jew who fa iled to sign up. 54 Although nearly all of Holland angrily condemned th e Nazi registra- tion, the Jews did as instructed. With few exceptio ns, every Dutch Jewish family dutifully picked up its questionnaires, fill ed them out completely, and filed with the nearest registration office. The unc anny compliance was based on traditional Dutch respect for laws and regulatio ns, as well as the stated penalty for not registering—five years in prison an d the confiscation of prop- erty. Jews also understood that resistance was futi le because their names had already long been innocently registered as \"Jewish\" in numerous statistical and registration bureaus throughout the Netherlands , and especially in the new card indices created by Lentz' personal identif ication program. Even though some Jews rioted in early February 1941, the entire community nonetheless filled out the forms as required. More than 157,000 question- naires were ultimately returned in the first months —more than the entire Jewish community because many sympathetic Dutchmen actually volun- teered to register alongside their Jewish countryme n. Lentz' punching cadres began converting the Jews to Hollerith records as q uickly as possible. 55 But none of it was fast enough for the Nazis. There were many delays. Although decree VO6/41 was espoused on January 10, 1941, German administrators did not release it to the media unti l January 14, when the"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"news was published around the world, including in t he Next York Times. Because the registration ruling did not become effe ctive until January 24, the official Dutch government gazette did not publi sh the details for census administrators until its February 3 issue. Hence lo cal Census Offices across the country lost time in setting up registration fa cilities. Nonetheless, the offices remained open all day and night to speed th e process. Each day, thou- sands of Dutch Jews marched into the local Census O ffice, paid a token guilder, and filled out the elaborate questionnaire s providing the Germans with everything they needed to know about their pos sessions, families, and parentage. 56 The German authorities at first praised the Census Office for \"exem- plary\" service. But as Wimmer's early April deadlin e approached and the tal- lies were far from complete, Lentz' organization wa s challenged and rebuked for tardiness. The Germans even suggested some loca lities were sabotaging the program. 57 Nazi administrators feared sabotage for good reason . Outraged Amster- dam workers had spontaneously called a strike, in l arge part over repressive measures. Nazi occupiers suppressed the d efiance by throwing hand grenades and firing machine guns at crowds of prote sters. Violent reprisals followed. The city of Amsterdam itself was fined 15 million guilders for the strike. 58 But Lentz bristled at any suggestion his operation was doing less than its best. As Inspector of the Population Registries , he defended his national operation down to the local office. On March 25, he blundy wrote Wimmer, \"The government Inspectorate has thus far received approximately 30,000 registrations from the local registration posts. . . . the delay in registration is definitely not based on registration posts not will ing to cooperate, or any sabotage, but on the circumstances, that the employ ees of the registration posts have been overburdened (specifically caused b y the identification card decree); and on top of that, we just could not appo int key, reliable employ- ees. The delay is also caused by the great number o f dubious cases and inter- rogations.\" Acknowledging that more than a quarter million names were expected, Lentz assured, \"I have ordered a circular letter by the Ministry of the Interior to the local registration posts, in wh ich I have again asked for the greatest haste.\" 59 Part of Wimmer's problem was that the Nazis simply could not take a Jewish census in Holland. A traditional census or p opulation count required an army of enumerators visiting every citizen's hom e, diligendy filling out forms. German administrators could not find reliabl e census takers to serve"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"among the outraged masses. A registration, on the o ther hand, depended upon Jewish subjects voluntarily walking i n t o the C ensus Office to fill out forms. That process was impeded by the general day- to-day reluctance that gripped Dutch Jewry, overcome only incrementally by each Jewish family. Moreover, a storm of venomous attacks in the popula r underground media of Amsterdam made even the staffers of local Census Offices queasy. 60 Two weeks later, on April 9, Lentz was still offeri ng the Germans ex- cuses for the slow progress, explaining that many l ocal burgomasters had not yet read the government gazette, which came out in February. 61 Of 1,050 municipalities outside Amsterdam, he repor ted, 1,019 had al- ready completed their registration. As an example o f local difficulties, he cited the town of Apeldoorn's \"difficulty registering the inmates of the local Jewish insane asylum.\" The poor inmates could not provide cogent responses. But by May 5, most burgomasters had completed their reg istration. For many, the task was easy; some 483 localities had not a single Jew to report. 62 By mid-May, Wimmer's office was beginning to unders tand that the constellation of overlapping local registrations in Holland fell short of what the Nazi program of destruction needed. Lentz' numerous Census Offices lacked the coordinated ability to identify, cross-index, and organize Jewish names nationally. Only a centralized Holleri th operation could do that. Moreover, Wimmer wanted the Jews alphabetized . Without alphabetiz- ing, an organized step-by-step round-up and deporta tion to camps could not occur. On May 19, 1941, Wimmer decided \"that besides the r egisters that have been constructed so far, a special alphabetica l register should be made, that pists] all Jews and Jews of mixed blood, who a re and have been reported after decree 6/41.\" This extra dimension w ould have tasked Lentz' overworked operation. To date, Lentz' bureaus had n ot even turned in reports on the first 78,119 questionnaires filed. W hile the Germans wanted to press Lentz to the maximum, they didn't want to pre ssure him too much. 63 So some days later, Lentz was notified, quite caref ully, by Hans Cal- meyer, Wimmer's chief expert on Jewish affairs. \"Dr . Wimmer would like to see constructed a register like the Hollerith punch card system,\" wrote Calmeyer. \"The register must [contain] age, profess ion, and gender ... [and] the category (Jew, Mixed I, Mixed II) to which the registered belongs. I don't deny that the compilation of such a register would form a serious bur- den for the Population Registries. However, without such an alphabetic reg- ister alongside the register on identity cards, and besides the already existing registers on municipalities, the [Jewish] registrat ion just won't be sufficient. 64 "},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"\"You will soon have to be prepared for many . . . r equests about infor- mation on individuals,\" Calmeyer continued. \"These requests won't be able to name the last residence of the requested person in every case. Such requests will form an extraordinary workload for yo ur office if the aforemen- tioned alphabetical register is not compiled, becau se thus far, the requests can only be answered after searching through all mu nicipal registers. Of course, the municipal registers should not be negle cted. . . . Pray, also let me know what kind of punch card system you think most efficient and most eas- ily introduced.\" Calmeyer ended his note asking how long Lentz would need in complete the alphabetical register. 65 Lentz was ahead of Wimmer and Calmeyer. With barely suppressed braggadocio, Lentz replied the next day, \"With much interest I have taken notice of your letter of 26th of May 1941, in which you informed me of the wishes of Sir Secretary of State Dr. Wimmer concern ing the making of [another] punch card system. I am glad to inform yo u that the Inspectorate has already been creating such a system according t o the Hollerith method for several weeks.\" 66 Two months earlier, Lentz had requested permission from the Interior Ministry to rent an extra Hollerith from the local IBM subsidiary. His expense request was approved on April 23 and he was waiting for the equip- ment. But as soon as the approval was granted, he b egan to advance work. \"I immediately commenced the execution of the plan,\" L entz informed Cal- meyer. \"We have already made much progress with the so-called 'coding' of the data and the punching is almost ready too, than ks to the co-operation of another government department. I add a model of the punch card for your information. The machinery has not arrived yet, but measures have been taken, so that this will soon become available.\" 67 There was a major problem, though, confessed Lentz. His entire pro- gram was based on numerical identification of indiv iduals, not alphabetical. He emphasized to Calmeyer, \"the [new] Hollerith pun ch card system is not suited for functioning as an alphabetical register since the cards are not punched by name, but by number. Punching alphabetic ally is possible, but there are so many technical difficulties connected with it.\" As a result, Lentz declared he would regretfully bypass all other proj ects and concentrate on the alphabetizing. \"I will now have an alphabetical register made that will contain the names of all Jews and Mischlinge [peopl e of mixed blood] who have reported for registering.\" 68 To further reduce delays, Lentz declared he would s plit the task into two: those Jews in Amsterdam and those outside the city. Since the areas"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"outside Amsterdam were already complete. Lentz prom ised that list first. \" This part will be ready about mid-June.\" If on the other hand, Wimmer and Calmeyer preferred Amsterdam first, Lentz could del iver that list just slightly later. \"If you would like to have the names of the registered people in Ams- terdam put into the alphabetical register as well,\" he stated, \"then I would be able to have that completed by the end of June o r in the beginning of July.\" 69 On May 30, 1941, a German civil occupation official summarized the on-going overlapping Hollerith projects to Wimmer a nd the many technical obstacles. \"Besides the already constructed and to be constructed registers,\" the report described \"a special alphabetical regist er, possibly with the Holle- rith punch card-system, for all people who have to report.\" But the punch cards for the new alphabetical file could not be pr inted without a careful design of data. So, the official added, his office would first have to determine exactly which punch card columns needed to be alloc ated to yield the desired data. 70 This was a question only Hollerith engineers could answer. Only IBM could print the cards. \"The Central Register has already requested the mat erial and the machines for the construction of the Hollerith syst em,\" the official continued. Repeating Lentz' warning, he told Wimmer, \"The Cent ral Register, however, points out that the [existing] Hollerith punch card system, which currently assigns a number to every processed form and regist ered person, is not appropriate for the compilation of an alphabetic re gister. The alphabetic punching is connected to so many technical difficul ties that a [quick] change of the system towards alphabetic processing seems j ust not possible in practice.\" 71 \"I don't deny,\" the report continued, \"that this [a dditional] processing of persons who are obligated to report from Amsterd am (over 85,000 per- sons), will greatly increase the workload of the Ce ntral Office, and it will also delay the completion of the special registers.\" 72 But for Wimmer, no time could be wasted. He ordered all alphabetizing projects to go forward at full speed, regardless of the difficulty. That was the priority. Lentz' devoted efforts prevailed. By June 14, 1941, Wimmer's office had received ten copies of a completed preliminary survey \"of all persons of Jewish blood.\" The alphabetical index would be read y shortly. \"Very soon,\" the report to Wimmer promised, \"we shall be able to start categorizing cer- tain groups through the Hollerith method.\" Now that the Jews were almost entirely alphabetized, demographic segments could b e cross-indexed, sorted, and then called up by age, gender, and profession, all in alphabetical order. 73 "},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"The systemwas soon ready. In early June 1941, and N azi Dutch resis- tance groups detonated two bombs in Amsterdam. In r eprisal, the Germans took action against 300 Dutch Jews, as well as a nu mber of German refugees between the ages of 18 and 30. The Nazis relied upo n Jewish organizational lists to round up Jewish youth workers. British int elligence reports asserted that when the number of Jews the Germans wanted fel l short, additional hostages were taken. A British intelligence officer , citing a Dutch Jewish refu- gee, reported the additional action this way: \"The Gestapo came with lists, from Standesamt [the Registry Office], carrying out searches in houses and looking for Jews in certain alphabetical groups. On one occasion, they took all the Jews whose names came within the alphabetic al register S to V.\" The British report added that all seized Jews seize d were eventually shipped to Mauthausen concentration camp, \"and most of them also died\" within several weeks.\" 74 By June 16, 1941, Lentz reported that his office ha d almost completed the total registration of Jewish persons commanded by decree V06/41, except for a few \"stragglers.\" He added that his In spectorate \"will now begin the registration of different groups via Hollerith method.\" Lentz wondered whether the Germans wanted any specific Jewish popu lation segments sorted first. \"I can process and pass on informatio n,\" he wrote, \"in case police services or German services urgently are looking fo r special groups, for example, artists or dentists.\" 75 A few weeks later, on July 26, 1941, Lentz notified Calmeyer that the Inspectorate had established his own priorities. P rocessing by age was already underway. Next, he would tackle those of Je wish blood who had served in the Dutch military. \"It is my intention,\" assured Lentz, \"after these duties, to start with the control on the punching o f Hollerith cards to improve the coding of professions.\" He would need a few weeks to finish these tasks if approved in that order. \"I hope to h ear from your side soon if you accept this proposal.\" 76 Within a month, virtually all \"stragglers\" had been found out or had come forward. By September 5, Wimmer was about to r eview summaries that identified the exact number of Jews, broken down by specific categories. Lentz had registered, sorted, and tabulated 118,455 Dutch Jews; 14,495 Ger- man Jews; and 7,295 others, as well as 19,561 mixed breed Mischlinge, for a total of 159,806. This included 700 so-called racia l Jews who were practicing Roman Catholicism; 1,245 belonging to Protestant ch urches; and 12,643 with no religious affiliation. 77 Lentz reflected on his mammoth accomplishment while jotting notes in"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"his personal handwritten journal, entitled Memoires I, Registration of Jews (Source and Development): \"I rented a Hollerith i nstallation,\" he penned, \"with which the professional statistical survey has been composed, which satisfied the Germans very much, and gave them the conviction s that my opinions had been correct.\" 78 He also thanked his Nazi overseers for their recogn ition for all his tech- nical achievements. \"I would like to express apprec iation,\" Lentz wrote to Wimmer's office, \"of the confidence you repose in m yself and my staff. Thanks to this and to your cooperation, the Census Office was able to con- trive ways and means of carrying out its often-diff icult task.

Those cards were sold for $106,920. 86 Ten days after the census ordered by decree V06/41 was fully com- piled, punched, and sorted, Nazi authorities demand ed all Jews wear the Jewish star. Again a number of Dutch people reacted with outrage and protest. British diplomats reported that in one tow n, when the burgomaster ordered Jews to affix the star, many non-Jews wore one as well. 87 But it was not the outward visage of six gold point s worn on the chest for all to see on the street, it was the 80 columns punched and sorted in a Hollerith facility that marked the Jews of Holland for deportation to concen- tration camps.

Bohmcker, a key Nazi official in Amsterdam , gleefully wrote to Arthur Seyss-Inquart, German Kommissar for Holland: 'Thanks to decree 6/41, all Dutch Jews are now in the bag.\" 88 F RANCE EXCELLED at many things. Punch card automation was not one o f them. Although IBM had been able to install several hundred Hollerith devices, mainly for high-volume military, railway, and banking users, Reich forces had in large part confiscated those machines . The rest of France sim- ply did not possess the punch card orientation of m any other European countries, such as Holland and Germany. IBM learned early that its brand of technologic change came slowly to some markets. France was a prime example. Holland's census and registration projects were mas terminded by a fanatical population registrar commanding hundreds of advanced machines still intact in a well-entrenched Hollerith infrast ructure supplied with decamillions of punch cards flowing from IBM NY and other European sub- sidiaries. Decades of Dutch registration that had i nnocently recorded religion and personal details could, under Lentz, be central ized into a clenching social dragnet. 89 But France lacked a tradition of census taking that identified religion. Henri Bunle, chief of the General Statistics Office of France, explained to Vichy collaborators on March 4, 1941: \"The General Statistics Office of France is not in a position to rectify published nu mbers as the last religious census in our country was undertaken in 1872. Since that date, the individual questionnaires used for counting have never touched upon questions of the religion of those counted.\" Later, on April 12, 194 1, he informed the newly established General Commission for Jewish Questions (GCJQ): \"France is actually the only country in Europe, or almost, whe re the number of Jews in its population is unknown, not to mention their age statistics, nationalities, professional affiliations, etc.\" 90 It was common to proclaim that no one really knew how many Jews lived in either France or even P aris. 91 Inexorably complicating identification was a confus ing patchwork of geopolitical social realities. Since the rise of Hi tler in 1933, masses of re- fugees had been streaming in and out of France. In some cases, some mem- bers of refugee families remained while others in t he group relocated. Most estimated that there were hundreds of thousands of undocumented refugees and other foreign-born Jews in France when Germany invaded in 1940.

During spring and summer 1940, when things setded down in the north, thousands of famil ies cautiously ventured back to look after their businesses, possessions, o r family members left behind. Jews routinely returned to Paris as late as November 1940. During May 1941, special trains transported 8,000 Jews fro m Vichy back to the north. Undeniably, Jews were constandy on the move between the two French zones. Addresses changed constantly. No one knew how many of the migrating Jews were foreign or native born. 92 In either French territory, many of the Jews, wheth er stationary or migrating, did not identify with Judaism, or hid th eir religious background. Many genuinely doubted their lineage would qualify under the Reich's rule about Jewish grandparents. Who could even trace or identify one's ancestry, especially if earlier generations hailed from outsi de France? Ambiguities about the dimensions of Jewish existence in France persisted even as many Jews reacted to looming anti-Jewish measures by ope nly attending syna- gogues. There was no way to quantify the number of Jews in France or gen- eralize about their character. 93 The problems of ancestral tracking, shifting addres ses, and other popu- lation uncertainties were only multiplied by the tw in French jurisdictions. Sometimes anti-Jewish measures were executed in one zone and not the other. Sometimes such measures were enacted months apart, or with vastly differing tenets. Aryanization of Jewish business, for example, was decreed on October 24, 1940, in Occupied France; the simila r decree in Vichy France was not issued until ten months later, August 27, 1 941. Adding in Jewish commercial and social existence in French colonies such as Morocco and Algeria, and making special provisions for the uniq ueness of Paris itself, only further muddied the ability to promulgate and enfor ce actions. 94 Berlin could overcome much of the geographical and ethnic confusion in France if it had enjoyed the regimented cooperat ion of its collaborators, whether reluctant or eager. However, for many leade rs in Vichy France, will- ful collaboration with the Reich was strained throu gh a French rightist mindset, which in many ways mimicked the early days of the Hitler move- ment. In the beginning phases of Nazism, foreign Je ws in Germany, so- called Eastern Jews, were targeted first and foremo st. In Nazi Germany,"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"German Jews who fought for the Reich in WWI were i n i t i a l l y afforded spe- cial status. So too, the French right wing conceptu alized foreign Jews, espe- cially refugees, as France's scourge. By this ultra -patriotic French thinking, the Jews chiefly deserving of brutal persecution we re not the established Jews of France, and especially not those who had di stinguished themselves with great national service. War veterans and even those contributing to France's cultural and scientific realms were worthy of special consideration. To do otherwise could be seen by French rightists a s an encroachment on certain French prerogatives. 95 No less a Vichy commander than Admiral Francois Dar lan, vice prime minister of Vichy with direct oversight of the anti -Jewish bureaus, was quoted as telling his Cabinet: \"The stateless Jews who, for the past 15 years have invaded our country do not interest me. But th e others, the good old French Jews, are entitled to all the protection tha t we can give them: I even have some of them in my family.\" Hence, a long list of special exemptions crept into the official French enforcement of anti- Semitic statutes, on either side of the Vichy line. 96 Those in both zones quickly learned that their anti -Jewish collabora- tion would be dealt with when France was liberated. As early as November 11, 1940, the leader of Free French forces, Charles DeGaulle, issued Nazi surrogates in Vichy a warning: \"Be assured . . . th e cruel decrees directed against French Jews can and will have no validity i n Free France. These blows are no less a blow against the honor of Franc e than they are an injus- tice against her Jewish citizens.... the wrongs don e in France itself [will] be righted.\" DeGaulle broadcast his remarks from recap tured French Equatorial Africa, and then asked that they be proclaimed to a meeting of the American Jewish Congress at Carnegie Hall. 97 Oppressive Nazi rule could have dictated its iron w ill to all reluctant French authorities, and conquered the demographi c uncertainties of a French Jewry in two zones if only the Holleriths co uld be deployed. That is precisely what Holleriths brought to any problem—or ganization where there was disorder and tabular certainty where there was confusion. The Nazis could have punch-carded the Jews of France into the same genocidal sce- nario in force elsewhere, including Holland. But in the aftermath of the MB's technologic ravages, France's punch card infrastruc ture was simply incapable of supporting the massive series of programs Berlin required. Even if the machines could have been gathered, transferred, or built—CEC just didn't have the punch cards."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"CEC had openly reported to IBM NY about its inabili ty throughout 1941 and 1942 to locate a dependable paper supply. Even with its reduced customer load, CEC clients required 50 tons of pape r monthly. But the French subsidiary's deliveries were generally ratio ned to as little as 15 tons per month—a mere ten-day supply. The Reich was dive rting the bulk of the cellulose needed for pulping into nitro-cellulose a t explosive plants through- out France. On January 1, 1942, CEC's punch card pa per stocks totaled 318 tons. One year later, CEC informed IBM NY that the on-hand inventory had dwindled to just 222 tons, of which only 71 tons we re from a paper mill that could reliably produce the high-tech stock tabulato rs required; the remain- ing 151 tons had come from a new and untested vendo r. Bad paper only jammed Holleriths, worsening the situation. 98 No wonder CEC blundy informed IBM NY, \"The oudook w as very dark ... we tried to obtain paper by all available means.\" Only by scraping the barrels of substitute suppliers could CEC \"live under the most drastic [paper] restrictions, which we imposed on our custo mers.\" 99 In September 1940, just after German forces transfe rred hundreds of French Holleriths to the Greater Reich, the first c ensus was ordered in Occu- pied France. 100 During the months and war years to come, exactly wh ich censuses were taken, by whom, and by what method, would constitut e a maze of mysteries, befuddling all in France and Germany. Registrations and census efforts would be announced and scheduled, and then delayed and rescheduled. They would take place over a period of months, but often the deadlines would be extended because the results were so incom plete. Some counting efforts were undertaken just in Vichy, some just in Occupied France, some in both. Many campaigns counted Jews; many counted the entire French popu- lation. Most were executed by a myriad of ad hoc ce nsus styles from the inept to the diligent. Incomplete, inaccurate, and inconsistent data ruled the entire enterprise. Heads of households were often c ounted instead of entire families. Children were often not included. Address es were not infrequendy omitted. Confused officials were on occasion forced to admit they simply had no idea where many of the Jews of France were. 101 No wonder the Prefect of Tarn complained in a Decem ber 22, 1941, let- ter to the General Commission for Jewish Questions, or GCJQ, that the results of the census ordered just months earlier w ere already obsolete since the method did not systematically record changes of address. 102 A later census inspector's report summarizing a maj or inquiry into the"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"head-count of eight provinces concluded: \"If it was needed, this work is proof that the census of Jews prescribed by the Jun e 2, 1941 law was poorly done ... a new census is necessary.\" 103 Germany's mushrooming labor needs only intensified the counting havoc. By 1942, Berlin had demanded as many as 600, 000 French conscript laborers under a strict recruitment schedule as the requirements of the Reich's war work changed. In October 1942, the Reic h demanded France deliver 35,000 of its railway workers for assignmen ts in Germany. Earlier, France had suggested the release of 50,000 French p risoners of war in exchange for 150,000 skilled workers. Recruitment p rojects required waves of age-specific worker registrations. One labor cen sus ordered all French men and women between the ages of 18 and 50, plus a nyone working less than thirty hours per week, to register. A second s urvey sought unmarried women between the ages of 21 and 35 by professional category. Yet another sought to immediately register all young men in a m ajor youth movement over the age of 21. All three census and registrati on programs were ordered within weeks during fall 1942. 104 Dozens more, equally disorganized, were undertaken during the occupation years. A new census program would be launched before the p revious one was completed. Germany was of course accustomed to mult iple, overlapping cen- sus and registration programs, but only because it could organize them with battalions of card punchers and fleets of Hollerith s fed by endless IBM cards. Those simply did not exist in France. Cascading chaos as Germany sought to count Jews and others in France ensured that the multifarious census and registrati on efforts would not only be misreported, misunderstood, and mishandled throu ghout the war years, but would be misinterpreted for decades after liber ation as well. 105 A fundamental cause of France's profound counting d isarray arose from its decentralized, almost anarchic, registration in frastructure. Registration was not implemented by professional statisticians o r experienced census offices. With no one to do the job properly, German y assigned it to the nation's police departments, the prefectures. That stood to reason, since police departments for years were accustomed to reg istering refugee Jews who entered their jurisdiction. Each prefecture exe cuted its own count in its own way, employing its own interpretations, and not always using the same forms as the next prefecture. They did not use punc h cards, but small col- ored pieces of paper and index cards. The machines they utilized were not IBM Holleriths whirring at great speed, but Remingt on typewriters with"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"sticking keys that constantly broke down. Pen and p encil were readily used when typing ribbon was not a v a i l a b l e . 1 0 6 The first real effort to systematically count Frenc h Jews had been rumored since the summer, but was finally announced in late September 1940. Jews in the Occupied Zone were ordered to reg ister with information about their businesses at police stations on specif ied days, according to an alphabetical sequence. The entire process was to ta ke eighteen days. 107 The numerical tally for the Seine province, includi ng Paris, was re- ported as 149,734; of these, 85,664 were categorize d as French nationals and 64,070 foreign born. The northern Jewish group regi stered approximately 11,000 Jewish businesses as well. Outside the Paris area, an additional 20,000 Jews were counted. These numbers were for th e Occupied Zone only. 108 It was one thing to count the Jews numerically even if the count was approximate. It was quite another to track them mon th in and month out, and organize them centrally for either ghettoizatio n or deportation. With a Hollerith, that diverse information would be sorted , tallied, and summarized to yield the desired results. But rather than compi le information in succinct automated tabulated results, French information was segmented into a series of traditional paper forms: yellow, beige, white, a nd red—often as many as five forms to complete a single personal file. T he forms, which came into use in January 1941, were known as Tulard file s, named for the Vichy police bureaucrat Andre Tulard, stationed in Paris. Quickly, the Tulard file became famous within French authoritarian circles, which, under the circum- stances, seemed the best means of tracking Jews. So on, the Tulard system, which had first been implemented in the Occupied Zo ne, was adopted in Vichy as well. 109 Unlike a Hollerith, which proofed and verified all its information to avoid errors, the Tulard system had no method of au tomatically deleting duplications. After the October 1940 counts for the Occupied Zone, some French newspapers began extrapolating the raw numbe rs for all of France. On March 4, 1941, Bunle, head of the General Statis tics Office of France, advocated another national census. \"Certain newspap ers have recently pub- lished fanciful evaluations of the numbers of Jews in France,\" Bunle wrote. \"These very exaggerated evaluations equal several t imes the actual number of Jews in the territory.\" 110 So a second major census was launched on June 14, 1 941. This one covered both zones, counting 287,962 Jews in 87 of France's 90 geographic"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"\"departments.\" German forces oversaw the count in O ccupied France. Vichy performed the function in the south. 111 The Jewish catalog that emerged required six pages of instructions sent to the police prefectures. Each multi-card fil e would be marked with various letters: J for Jewish; NJ for non-Jewish, o r for someone cleared of Jewish ancestry; N for nationality; D for domicile information; and P for their professional details. Multiple manual catalogs were set up for foreign Jews and French-born Jews. One whole card was designated just to record a woman's maiden name. 112 Confusion and lack of preparation were everywhere. A May 15 letter from the General Commission on Jewish Questions to the Attorney General tautologically clarified, \"If a Jew has not declare d equipment for use in the practice of his profession, this constitutes a non- declaration of goods.\" Another explanatory letter from the GCJQ, on June 2 4, 1941, confirmed to an inquiring government official that the census la ws simply did not apply to certain colonial territories. On July 9, the GCJQ i nformed the President of the Council that it extended the June 14 census dea dline \"because the pre- fectures have not had time to prepare.\" Ads were pl aced in the newspapers publishing the new deadline. That same day, July 9, a census staffer jotted a notation that the census forms had been received, a nd they \"will be done as soon as the Department of the Interior has the nece ssary personnel.\" 113 A December 1, 1941, letter from a provincial admini strator to the Pre- fect of Police explained that only Jews who had a r esidence in France were required to register. That left out the many disloc ated Jews residing in hotels or living with another family, including many refug ees. One survey of French provinces returning census reports itemized a long list of data missing from their forms: many left out gender, profession, nati onality, and in many cases, all three. Many lists bore numerous typos and overt yped sections, so some names and addresses were illegible. 114 When the Interior Ministry dispatched its long list of instructions to all prefects in France, it included a caution: \"Since t he number of these cards is limited due to their high price, please let me know , after creating the cards, the categories in which you have extra cards. This way I can distribute them to other Prefectures who have a shortage, as they w ill also be letting me know which cards they are short on.\" 115 As France began its census activities, none of it w as being recorded on punch card for automated retrieval.

The experience of a single prefect was typ ical. On January 29, 1942, a German official asked the Prefect of Eure f or the personal declara- tions made by district Jews, as well as inventories of their Jewish goods and enterprises. That same day, he also requested infor mation from the provi- sional administrators of Jewish housing. On March 1 4 and again on April 2, the Prefect of Eure furnished the Police for Jewish Concerns with selected demographic information. On June 5, 1942, the Eure Prefect sent the Police for Jewish Concerns various tables listing Jews by age, gender, nationality, and profession—all in duplicate. On July 3, 1942, t he Police for Jewish Con- cerns needed the number of Jews between ages 16 and 45 wearing the yel- low star, all Jews between 16 and 45 required to we ar the yellow star even though married to an Aryan, Jews older than 45 wear ing the yellow star, and those Jews who because of their nationality did not wear the yellow star at all. All names were to be typed by gender listing a ll names and addresses where available. 117 In a move to centralize all the information into a single, easily accessible catalog, 100,000 forms were sent to a special polic e unit headquartered in the Hotel de Russie in Vichy. In December 1941, the Police for Jewish Con- cerns could finally visualize the massive quantity of census and registration forms to be sorted. The police bureau told CGJQ dir ector Xavier Vallat that the task was impossible. On December 19, 1941, Vall at acknowledged the crisis. \"The file would normally be established by your police service,\" asserted Vallat, \"but it has become apparent from s everal conversations with your offices that it has neither the personnel requ ired nor the equipment necessary for this operation. Due to this situation we have thought to ask [for] help.\" 118 Vallat unexpectedly found the help he needed. Rene Carmille, comp- troller general of the French Army, had for years b een an ardent advocate of punch cards. More than that, he had machines in goo d working order at his government's Demographic Service. Carmille came for ward and offered to end the census chaos. He promised that his tabulato rs could deliver the Jews of France. 119 "},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"W H E N G E R M AN requisition teams began pilfering Hollerith machine s in Au- gust 1940, Rene Carmille, a mysterious French milit ary technocrat, rescued his tabulators. Under cover of night, he moved the precious devices from his military finance office to a hiding place in a gara ge. In so doing, the French military's punch card capability was preserved. A f ew months later, on Novem- ber 14, 1940, Carmille single-handedly created Fran ce's Demographic Service in Vichy. It was just a few weeks after the first J ewish census in the Occupied Zone, and from the Nazi viewpoint, the new agency w as wholly compatible with Berlin's labor recruitment and racial agenda. The Vichy government en- trusted his agency with the responsibility for all social statistics projects. It operated at least twenty offices on both sides of t he zone boundary. 120 Once established, Carmille carefully began strength ening his small arsenal of tabulators. Not only did he work with Ho lleriths, but he also had access to a Bull and even a Powers machine. In 1941 , Carmille signed a 36- million-francs contract with Bull for new machines, even though the chance of delivery from their new plant in Lyon was in gre at doubt. He also signed a multi-million-franc contract with CEC calling for a series of powerful machines to be delivered on a strict schedule; mill ions of francs in fines and penalties were to be paid by CEC if they could not maintain the delivery reg- imen. 121 When Carmille began the Demographic Service, he was not allied with the General Commission on Jewish Questions, the ant i-Semitic Vichy agency coordinating Jewish registrations. But he was certa inly hoping to attract the agency's attention. In March 1941, he made a point of informing GCJQ Director Vallat that his statistics for Jewish stud ents were incorrect. 122 Carmille had been working for months on a national Personal Identifi- cation Number, a number that would not only be sequ ential, but descriptive. The thirteen-digit PIN number would be a manual \"ba r code\" of sorts describing an individual's complete personal profil e as well as professional skills in great detail. For example, one number wou ld be assigned for metal workers, with a second modifying number for brass, and then a third modi- fying number for curtain rods. Tabulators could the n be set to whisk through millions of cards until it located French m etal workers, specializing in brass with experience in curtain rods. Those met al workers could also be pinpointed in any district. The system mimicked a c oncurrent Reich codifica- tion system that assigned a descriptive bar code-li ke number to every prod- uct and component in Germany. Carmille's number wou ld ultimately evolve into France's social security number. 123 In spring 1941, Carmille was readying the professio nal July 1941 cen-"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"sus of all French citizens aged 14 to 65. Question 11 asked Jews to identify themselves not only by their professed religion but also by their grand- parents. The program was highly publicized. An arti cle in the New York Times several weeks later reported, \"Special registering machines are being used in this census. By a system of perforations—every citi zen will receive a number composed of thirteen digits—information will be obt ainable . . . county by county.\" An interesting emphasis in the questionnai re was on agricultural skills. A second New York Times article on the cens us actually identified the program as tied to an agricultural drive. 124 Any Vichy official or Nazi repre- sentative in France would surely approve of such a census. It would not only identify the workers, including farm laborers, but the Jews among them. In mid-June 1941, Vichy launched the second major c ensus of Jews, this one in both zones. The question was how would the questionnaires be processed, through manual methods with paper files, or with the dynamic capabilities of Holleriths? L YON , J UNE 18, 1941 To Xavier Vallat General Commissioner for Jewish Questions Object: Census of the Jews The June 2, 1941 law, published in the Journal Offi ciel on June 14, 1941, orders a census of all persons who are consid ered Jewish in the eyes of the law of that same date regarding the sta tus of Jews. The inquiry that.. . your General Commissariat is g oing to under- take greatly interests the Demographics Department, which was given responsibility for all statistical operations regar ding the population of France....

This will be used to prod uce, at any given moment, the general demographic profile of the nati on.

Rene Carmille 125 Like many French bureaucrats, Vallat was resistant to Carmille's con- traptions. He worried that commencing a punching op eration from scratch would delay the reports. Vallat trusted the Tulard system, even though it was m a n u a l —and probably because it was manual. So on Ju ne 21, Vallat wrote back to Carmille, \"I have thought about integrating this census with the operations your department handles, but it did not seem possible to me, first to prolong the process, given the economic urgency of the census of Jewish persons and belongings, and second, given the parti cular nature of the infor- mation that I need. And I decided to immediately or der a [Tulard] file which has proved valuable in the occupied zone and which I will distribute to pre- fects and mayors in the coming week. I will always be happy to provide you with any information thus obtained.\" 126 Only when Vallat's people were confronted with the mountains of forms to be assimilated did they realize that Carmi lle presented the only hope of efficiendy identifying the Jews. Vallat tra nsferred the processing assignment to him. On October 11, 1941, Carmille fo rmed the National Sta- tistical Service, which subsumed the General Statis tics Office of France and merged it with the Demographic Service. Carmille st ated, \"The new statistical service would have a different point of departure, namely to establish files for individuals.\" He added, \"We are no longer deali ng with general censuses, but we are really following individuals.\" Carmille made clear, \"the new organization must now be envisioned in such a way t hat the information be"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"obtained continuously, which means that the updatin g of information must be carefully regulated.\" 127 Carmille was now France's great Hollerith hope. On December 2, 1941, Vallat notified Carmille, \"The Jewish census operations in the occupied zone, as ordered by the law of 2 June 1941, is finished; we collected approximately 140,000 declar ations.\" 128 On December 19, a seemingly impatient Vallat complained to the Ministry of the Interior, \"The file would normally be established by your Pol ice service. But it has become apparent from several conversations with you r offices that it has nei- ther the personnel required nor the equipment neces sary for this operation. Due to this situation we have thought to ask the he lp of the designated Demographic Service to ensure the completion of thi s task for which they are equitably suited. They have agreed and they have of fered to forward this task to their tabulating workshops in Clermont-Ferr and and Limoges.\" 129 Vallat later asked the Ministry to pay the consider able cost of the tabu- lation services, 400,000 francs, and to arrange for transportation of materials to Carmille offices. That was approved. 130 Now the Jewish forms were all in the possession of Carmille. But the numbers were just not matching up. Vallat w as to have sent 140,000 personal declarations. But on June 3, 1942, Carmille's office con- firmed it had \"received to date 109,066 declaration s, of which 20% (exactly 17,980 declarations) were not received until 4 May 1942.\" 131 Things were going much slower than anyone expected. To further delay the operation, CEC was now default ing on its rigid delivery schedule. CEC just could not manufacture m achines as required while Dehomag was usurping all its resources. In ea rly 1943, the subsidiary in Paris informed IBM NY, \"A certain number of tran sactions with the Na- tional Statistical Service have . . . caused the ap plication of penalties. . . . The amount of these penalties might reach a figure of 4 million [francs] in view of the size and importance of the deals, and because o f the company's inability to deliver machines according to contract schedules .... A one year delay and waving of penalties was requested.\" 132 In the meantime, Berlin would not wait. Using the l ess efficient Tulard cards, it began organizing round-ups of Jews in Par is. In early May 1941, 6,494 summonses were left at presumed Jewish reside nces, mainly foreign Jews. They were instructed to report on May 14 to o ne of seven centers with their identification in hand. Nazi-allied offi cials could not be certain exacdy which addresses were accurate and up-to-date . With Carmille's tabu- lations not yet ready, the Germans, in essence, rel ied on the Jews to turn themselves in. The results yielded only half what t he Nazis had hoped for."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"On the appointed day, May 14, 1941, an estimated 3, 400 to 3,700 Jews, mainly of Polish origin, did report as requested. T hey were immediately sent to camps. 133 A second raid was conducted on August 20, 1941. Thi s time, French agitators, including many professionals, in Paris' 11th Arrondissement were targeted. The Tulard files offered precise lists of names and addresses and even stairwells of many Jews. But the numbers again fell short. Police units cordoned off major intersections—and even blocked t he subway exits, grab- bing any Jewish man between the ages of 18 and 50. But only 3,022 Jews were arrested. For three more days, the authorities tried to locate more Jews. The inefficient operation only netted 609 on August 21. Then on August 22, they located 325 more. On August 23, as the word sp read and Jews every- where in the District tried to disappear, only 122 Jews were nabbed. The total for the four days was 4,078. The men were sen t to the Drancy transit concentration camp. Paris was shocked and outraged because the raids seized both foreign and French-born Jews. 134 But for the Germans, it meant the updated data from Tulard was profoundly inefficient . A third major raid on December 12, 1941, hoped to snare 1,000 Parisian professionals. The obsolete Tulard files o nly yielded 743 correct addresses. To round out the numbers, foreign Jews w ere picked up at ran- dom on Paris streets. 135 Where was Carmille? Where were his Holleriths? By the end of 1941, numerous Vichy officials had co ncluded the elabo- rate census of June 1941 conducted in both zones wa s completely nonfunc- tional. A new one was needed. 136 On January 13, 1942, the Vichy Finance Minister, co nscious of the extraordinary expense, bitterly objected to the Int erior Ministry. \"A general census of the Jews has already been done,\" the Fina nce Minister complained. \"If all the desired information had been requested at the time, it would be superfluous to undertake a new census a few months later. I ask you please do not proceed with the projected census or with ot her measures of this nature without consulting the National Statistics S ervice. Their experience in this matter could be helpful in avoiding gaps or re peated information that could present serious problems from a technical as well as a financial point of view.\" 137 Again, where was Carmille? By February 1942, Eichmann's office in Paris report ed that the prefec- ture lists were completely insufficient, asserting, \"our offices are constantly demanding corrections.\" 138 Something needed to be done."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"German officials began turning to the French Jewish Council for names. The Union Generale des Israelites en France, the so -called UGIF, became a prime source for the Gestapo. The UGIF was vested with the sole authority for all Jewish welfare and any other communication between the Jews in Occupied France and the German authorities. Therefo re, Jews invariably came to the UGIF offices to sign up for welfare ser vices and submit inquiries about interned loved ones. French Jews even paid sp ecial communal assess- ments to the UGIF. The Germans granted the UGIF unp recedented access to all Vichy census lists and allowed the organizat ion to manually update them. These were then turned over to the Nazis by t he UGIF. In fact, the UGIF maintained a whole department for providing li sts to the authorities They called it Service 14. 139 When one list was not up-to-date, the Germans asked for a revision— again and again until perhaps on the fourth revisio n the names well complete. 140 In many cases, Nazi agents merely waited to abduct those Jews who ventured to the constandy watched UGIF office. 141 Although many Parisian Jews feared appealing to the UGIF for assis- tance, at some point of economic, emotional, or fam ilial desperation, a num- ber would risk the approach. Ail too often, that co ntact would presage their apprehension. The UGIF's efforts to comply with Ger man demands for con- tinually updated names could only be described as r elendess. 142 For example, in July 1942, the UGIF Bulletin publis hed a notice regard- ing the children of incarcerated parents. These chi ldren, living in terror, were essentially being hidden by family friends and rela tives. \"We are composing a central listing,\" read the UGIF notice, \"of all tho se Jewish children whose parents were arrested recently. If the children wer e taken in by a private organization or by individual families, and you hav e knowledge of this, we request you let us know immediately.\" The notice wa s published within the framework of UGIF welfare services that sought to r ender financial assis- tance to abandoned or orphaned Jewish children. 143 However, in a telling rebuttal some weeks later, an other quasi-sanctioned Jewish organization aligned with the resistance dec lared: if welfare assistance to the displaced children involved produced a list of the families who have taken them in, the UGIF should not bother. 144 Later, when the UGIF tried to impose a special head tax to finance a new UGIF census, the underground press condemned it in no uncer- tain words."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"NOTICE FROM THE JEWISH UNDERGROUND In order to participate in the expenses of the Unio n Generale des Israelites en France, and to compensate for the insufficient v oluntary contributions, all Jews . . . will be subject to a head-tax of 120 fra ncs for the occupied zone, and 360 francs for the non-occupied zone. . . .

Not a penny to the Germans! 145 In July 1942, Eichmann arrived in Paris with direct orders from Himmler. All the Jews of France—foreign or native-born—were to be immediately sent to camps. Eichmann began personally supervisin g the systematic depor- tation of Jews. Berlin had assigned 37,000 freight cars, 800 passenger cars, and 1,000 locomotives to Occupied France. But local authorities were con- stantly falling short on the quotas. 146 On July 15, one train could not leave on time. Eich mann was outraged, calling the missed departure \"disgraceful\" in view of how much effort had gone into the schedule. A Nazi official assigned to the Jewish solution recalled the moment: Eichmann threatened, the Nazi recalled, that perhaps he might \"drop France entirely as a country to be e vacuated.\" The belea- guered Nazi promised Eichmann no more trains would be late. Frantic local officials did everything they could to comply with Eichmann's obsessive demand for Jews. Hence all attempts to create a hie rarchy of exemptions within the French ultra-conservative mindset, such as for women or chil- dren, or French nationals or war veterans—these all quickly eroded. 147 Typical was the frenzy exhibited by one French poli ceman when he scribbled a note on September 12, 1942: \"Under our current obligation to come up with one thousand deportees on Monday, we m ust include in these"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"departures... the parents of sick [children] and ad vise them that they could be deported with their child remaining in the infir mary.\" 148 Throughout 1942, the Germans must have wondered wha t had hap- pened to Carmille's operation. GCJQ Commissioner Va llat had assured the Ministry of the Interior that Carmille would provid e \"day-to-day mainte- nance of the file using perfected tabulation proces ses. . . . our Services will have permanent access to an updated database for it s work.\" To this end, Carmille had been given a card file of 120,000. He had the only copy. There was no duplicate. 149 But Carmille continued a mystery. In October 1943, Rene Carmille traveled under an as sumed name to the town of Annemasse, near the Swiss border, for a secret meeting with rela- tives of Emile Genon, director of IBM Belgium. Geno n was now stationed in Geneva and had been assigned by IBM NY to maintain up-to-date informa- tion on all European subsidiaries being operated by German-appointed cus- todians. Genon wanted intelligence about Westerholt , the SS man appointed CEC trustee. What were his strengths and weaknesses ? Carmille gladly pro- vided it, as he needed the continued help of IBM fo r his punch card opera- tion. Indeed, just after the War, Watson would disp atch a personal emissary and long-time aide, J. J. Kenney, to meet with Carm ille's widow in Paris at the Hotel Georges V. At that post-war meeting, Kenn ey extended Watson's personal thanks for Carmille's regular information. 150 Clearly, Carmille was running an active tabulator o peration. Why wasn't he producing the Jewish lists? By November 8, 1942, the Americans, along with some British troops, had landed in Algeria. As many hoped, local French forces joined the Allied campaign against Hitler. On December 5, 1942, Frenc h forces seized the entire National Statistics Service branch office in Algier s. Using Carmille's system of tabulators and punch card files, DeGaulle's people were able to organize a seemingly miraculous rapid mobilization of thousand s of Frenchmen and others into specific units. As soon as January 17, 1943, the loyal French ele- ments in Algeria were ready to fight as a cohesive and efficient army. 151 Instandy mobilized French forces in Algeria fiercel y fought the German army along the Algerian-Tunisian border until the R eich was dislodged. It was the beginning of the end of Hitler's army in No rth Africa. Those French units proceeded to Italy and continued to fight thr oughout the war. 152 The Germans could not understand how the French arm y in Algeria was assembled so quickly. Carmille's office there h ad only been tracking Jews, farm workers, and general laborers."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"Just days after the French mobilized in Algeria the Nazis discovered that Carmille was a secret agent for the French res istance. He had no inten- tion of delivering the Jews. It was all a cover for French mobilization. SECTION III F German Intelligence The Section received from Paris a dossier in which there was found informa- tion about a special bureau in Lyon which, under th e cover of a census of the population, was in fact a secret mobilization offic e. We had been informed that nearly all the directors of that office were G eneral Officers or Superior Officers [of the resistance]. The Demographic Offic e could find, in a matter of moments, using special cards, all the specialist s (Aviators, Tank Drivers, Mechanics, etc. . . . [both the] officers and enlis ted personnel) needed to make up organized units. . . . This was not a censu s bureau but rather an office of mobilization. Walter Wilde special agent 153 Carmille had deceived the Nazis. In fact, he had be en working with French counter-intelligence since 1911. During the worst days of Vichy, Carmille was always considered one of the highest-p laced operatives of the French resistance, a member of the so-called \"Marco Polo Network\" of sabo- teurs and spies. Carmille's operation had generated some 20,000 fake iden- tity passes. And he had been laboring for months on a database of 800,000 former soldiers in France who could be instandy mob ilized into well- planned units to fight for liberation. Under his pl an, 300,000 men would be ready to go. He had their names, addresses, their m ilitary specialties, and all their occupational skills. He knew which ones were metal workers specializ- ing in curtain rods, and which were combat-ready tr oops. 154 As for column 11 asking for Jewish identity, the ho les were never punched—the answers were never tabulated. 155 More than 100,000 cards of Jews sitting in his office—never handed over. 156 He foiled the entire enterprise. Two punch cards were secretly obtained and sent to Gestapo headquar- ters at Hotel Lutetia in Paris. Carmille was expose d. Some German officers demanded his immediate arrest along with the fourte en-member senior staff of the National Statistics Services. But German int elligence officer Wilde rea- soned that someone needed to run the tabulators so that crucial work"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"brigades could still be marshaled to Germany. After all, the strictly occu- pational information was indeed up to date. So Carm ille was allowed to continue his operation. But automated Jewish inform ation was now beyond Nazi reach. 157 Suspecting he was under suspicion, Carmille nonethe less fearlessly addressed the 1943 graduating class of the Polytech nic School in Paris where his remarks could easily be overheard: \"No power in the world\" he exhorted them, \"can stop you from remembering that you are the heirs of those who defended the co untry of France, from those who stood on the bridge of Bouvines... to those who fought at the Marne. Remember that! \"No power in the world can stop you from remembering that you are the heirs of Cartesian thought, of the myst icism and mathematics of Pascal, of the clarity of the writers of the 16th C entury, and the perennial accomplishments of the 19th Century thinkers, all t his—in France. Remember that! \"No power in the world can stop you from real izing that your institution has furnished the world with [great] thinkers . . . that freedom of thought has always existed... with rigor and tenacity. Remember that! \"No power in the world can stop you from knowing th at the motto inscribed in gold letters on the pavilion: For Country, For Know ledge, and For Glory' and the weighty heritage that constitutes the immense w ork of your ancestors, is for you a categorical imperative which must guide your path of conduct. Remember that! \"All this is written in your soul, and no one can control your soul, because your soul only belongs to God.\" 158 In early 1944, SS security officers ordered Carmill e arrested. He was apprehended in Lyon at noon on February 3, 1944. He was taken to the Hotel Terminus where his interrogator was the infam ous Butcher of Lyon, Klaus Barbie. Barbie was despised as a master of to rture who had sadistically questioned many members of the resistance. Carmille went for two days straight under Barbie's hand. He never cracked. 159 ON JUNE 11, 1942, Germany had ordered 15,000 Jews immediate ly deported from Holland. Eichmann's people used the word \"evac uated.\" The ultimate destination for Dutch Jewry would be the death camp s of Auschwitz and Sobibor. 160 France's quota was 100,000 drawn from both Zones. B ut Theodor Dan- necker, Eichmann's assistant in Paris, realized he could never meet his quota. On June 22, 1942, the numbers suddenly changed. 161 "},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"France's new quota was reduced to 40,000 Jews. H o l l a n d ' s was in- creased to 40,000. 162 Holland's Hollerith program under Lentz was a model of efficiency. By Match of 1944, Waffen-SS commanders in The Hague ha d ordered a new bombproof facility for Lentz' Population Registry. The new center was to be laced with bunkers to protect the Holleriths and th eir precious cards. Sepa- rate punching, tabulating, and alphabetizing rooms were arranged around a massive punching pool. One corner office was design ated just for \"lost cards.\" Administrative and control offices complete d the complex. 163 With Dutch Jewry handily identified, residentially confined under ghetto-like conditions, and constantly tracked, all that remained now was to organize their efficient deportation to concentrati on camps. Their names could be called up in an orderly fashion by demogra phic sector, age, or geo- graphic locale, and of course always alphabetized. It began in July 1941. Names were taken from the Ce ntral Office card indices. Special demographic maps at the Amsterdam Municipal Bureau of Statistics identified the Jewish population, distri ct by district, using red num- bers for Jews and blue numbers for non-Jews. In som e maps, \"dots\" were marked onto city maps to more graphically identify Jewish population den- sity by district—the more dots in a district, the m ore Jews. By July 1942, reg- ular transports started running to a Dutch transit camp called Westerbork. The Dutch Judenrat, known as the Joodsche Raad, sen t a contingent from its own staff to Westerbork to function as a registrati on department. Arrivals in Westerbork were directed into a large registration hall manned by about sixty registrars, who would take the prisoners' ide ntity papers, ration cards, and other personal documents. 164 One British intelligence report at the time declare d, \"The human being [now] becomes a number. ... A duplicate of the new barracks number card goes into the card index.... a special card index [ is maintained] in the camp. The identity papers of the deported Jews are then s ent to the headquarters of the Population Register at the Hague which thus received the names of almost all the Jews who were deported from Westerbo rk to Poland.\" From Westerbork, they were transported to Auschwitz and other death camps. Twice weekly trains began July 15, 1942. 165 Soon, the call up of names in Holland was so effici ent, the Nazis regu- larly exceeded their quotas. For example, during on e period, orders origi- nally called for 3,000 Jews to be transported betwe en January 11 and January 31, 1943. But 600 additional Dutch Jews wer e gathered, so a total of 3,600 occupied the five transports. The next four t ransports carried 4,300. 166 "},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"By the close of 1942, virtually the entire 40,000 i nitial quota was met. Deportations continued. The 8,000 Jews residing in insane asylums and sana- tariums were targeted next. The largest was the fac ility near Apeldoorn, the institution where inmates had such difficulty respo nding coherently to detailed census questions. January 21 and 22, 1943, SS detachments arrived at Apeldoorn hospital. In what was recorded as a pa rticularly brutal episode, the SS men sadistically beat and herded the bewilde red inmates, including many children, into catde wagons—and from there to the train depot. 167 It never stopped in Holland. The Population Registr y continued to spew out tabulations of names. The trains continued to roll. Meanwhile, in France, the Germans also deported Jew s to death camps as often as possible. But in France, Nazi forces we re compelled to continue their random and haphazard round-ups. 168 Carmille was sent to Dachau, prisoner 76608, where he died of exhaus- tion on January 25, 1945. He was posthumously honor ed as a patriot although his role in dramatically reducing the numb er of Jewish deaths in France was never really known and in some cases dou bted. How many lives he saved will never be tabulated. After the war, Le ntz explained he was just a public servant. He was tried, but only on unrelated charges, for which he was sentenced to three years inprison. 169 Holland had Lentz. France had Carmille. Holland had a well-entrenched Hollerith infrastructure. France's punch card infra structure was in complete disarray. The final numbers: Of an estimated 140,000 Dutch Jews, more than 107,000 were deported, and of those 102,000 were murdered—a deat h ratio of approxi- mately 73 percent. 170 Of an estimated 300,000 to 350,000 Jews living in F rance, both zones, about 85,000 were deported—of these barely 3,000 su rvived.

He was not a p olitician, an executive, or a member of high society dazzled by W atson's gleam or IBM's corporate prestige. Rather, he was just a simple person"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"waging a war at home while America's troops fought overseas. His name was Harold J. Carter. Carter was a little-noticed investigator working in a little-noticed group that functioned under various names, and wended its bureaucratic way through a variety of federal organizational charts. But the unit was most frequently referred to as the \"Economic Warfare Sec tion\" attached to the Department of Justice. Its mission was to acquire e conomic intelligence and confound enemy commerce. Carter was also looking in to a category of crimes loosely styled \"trading with the enemy.\" He understood that foiling the commercial and technologic infrastructure of th e Axis powers was as important as deploying tanks and troops. Carter's c ombat was waged not with carbines and grenades, but with subpoenas and indictments. During 1942 and early 1943, he began looking at Internatio nal Business Machines. Working out of a fourteenth floor office at 30 Broa d Street in lowwe Manhattan, Carter must have comprehended that he wa s but a very small person looking into a very big operation run by ver y powerful people. Wat- son could pick up the phone and call the White Hous e, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the most senior Army officials. But Ca rter was unaffected by the Watson gravisphere. He saw something very different in the haze and maze of IBM's involvement with Nazis. Carter was determi ned to put the pieces together. 1 After reviewing Treasury license requests, media re ports, financial filings, intelligence intercepts from Switzerland, and other materials, Carter concluded that IBM had constructed a unique interna tional cartel responsi- ble for about 90 percent of the punch card technolo gy in the world. This included Nazi Germany, which had developed an extra ordinary punch card industry used extensively for all manner of commerc e, aggression, and perse- cution. Carter concluded that IBM's cartel and its special leasing practices, as well as its complete control of the punch cards nee ded to operate Hollerith systems, meant that the company possessed a virtual monopoly on the tech- nology. But far more than that, because of its grip on punch cards and spare parts, and its ownership of all machines, IBM exerc ised virtual dominion over any Hollerith's day-to-day ability to function . As a result, IBM wielded a crucial continuing impact on Nazi Germany's ability to plan and wage war. 2 Carter saw IBM not as a great American company, but a global monster. In Carter's view, Watson was no capitalist luminary but an opportunist to be classed with the Nazis themselves. The only way to secure the evidence he needed to begin prosecution against IBM and its exe cutives was to walk into their headquarters and seize the documents. He need ed a subpoena. 3 "},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"An eighteen page draft preliminary report was prepa red, complete with diplomatic intercepts, summaries of telephone conve rsations between CEC and IBM Geneva, translations of letters between IBM 's Werner Lier in Geneva and attorney Heinrich Albert in Berlin, as w ell as corporate corre- spondence outlining IBM's tenacious fight against t he Dehomag revolt. Carter was cautious in building his case. But he used plai n words to portray the grav- ity of his investigation and explain the unique and less-than-apparent forces at work. He entitled his undated draft \"Control in Bus iness Machines.\" 4 CONTROL IN BUSINESS MACHINES This is a story of a peculiar type of cartel. Gener ally speaking, the cartel arrangements which have been heretofore considered deal with instances wherein the cartel control stems from Germany, or o ne of the other Axis countries, and into the United States for the purpo se of curtailing production of critical materials following a deliberate plan o f Nazi economic warfare. Previously a villain like I.G. Farben or Siemens Ha lske has reached its tenta- cles into American Industry and curtailed productio n through patents, licens- ing agreements, and other types of control. This st ory deals with an American firm which has deprived not only our own citizens b y limiting supply but also the citizenry of the world. Americans and Germans a like have felt the pinch- ing hand of Thomas J. Watson and International Busi ness Machinery mani- fested through universal limited production and int ernational high prices. In this case, the monopoly control originates in the U nited States and operates throughout the world. And what Hitler has done to u s through his economic warfare, one of our own American corporations has a lso done. In this \"arse- nal of democracy,\" which supplies materiel for over half the warring world, limited production spells our worst enemy. Hence IB M is in a class with the Nazis. Further, we have a peculiar clash of interests. Thi s [World War] is a con- flict of warlike nationalistic states, each having certain interests. Yet we fre- quently find these interests clashing diametrically with the opposing interests of international corporate structures, more huge an d powerful than nations. These corporate entities are manned not by staffs o f citizens of any nation, but by citizens of the world looking solely to the corporate interest and pledging loyalty thereto. We see revealed [in] this clash, this dichotomy of culture between our nation and an international cor poration whose interests do not coincide... . Dr. Hollerith was employed by the U.S. Bureau of Ce nsus in 1880 where it"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"was necessary for him to spend much time in the ro utine of addition and subtraction. As a timesaving device, he invented th ese tabulating machines run by electric current for the use of the Census B ureau. He sold his patents to the predecessor of International Business Machin es Company, who set up their legal monopoly based on these patents. The pa tents have since expired but so many additional patents were taken out by IB M on improvements and refinements of the original Hollerith machines that the field has been entirely weighted down and the legal monopoly extended. The monopoly still exists because of the many patents taken out by IBM on man y small technical changes but all based upon the original Hollerith p atents. A question might well be raised as to whether the patents belong to Dr. Hollerith or the U.S. Government in the first place. . . . Since Dr. Holl erith was an employee of a branch of our government and since there was a defi nite connection between his work of computing and his invention, the questi on might well be raised as to whether the patents belonged to Dr. Hollerith and were his to sell or to the U.S. Government at the time of dieir grant.... As to the fact that these monopolies [IBM and the o nes IBM imposed on Powers and Remington Rand in the U.S.] existed, the re can be little doubt. These companies deliberately conspired to limit pro duction, dictate price and restrain competition as much as possible. This fact has been declared by the United States Supreme Court. We see a monopoly inflicted on the people of the United States. We shall now attempt to show the effect of tjis monop- oly on the outside world, the international cartel arrangement. This is a story of circumstantial evidence. Practic ally no documentation or direct evidence can be produced proving the existen ce of the cartel. Yet one indirect source after the other points to that ulti mate conclusion and the indirect evidence is so frequent as to be almost un deniable.... These international corporations have grown so larg e that very often their interests and the national interests within which t hey are supposedly contained do not coincide. The personnel of IBM, though nomin ally citizens of the United States, is actually composed of citizens of the world. Their loyalties to their corporation know no national bounds. Mr. Thom as J.

A so-called \"Proclaimed List\" of blacklisted companies had grown from 1,800 in the summer of 194l to 5,000 European and Latin American companies by mid-January 1942. These prohibited firms were considered either Nazi-owned or Nazi- connected, whether located in Nazi Europe or in neu tral countries such as Portugal, Spain, or Switzerland. Of course, all dir ect trading with Germany and Italy was prohibited. Some firms were included merely because they were considered Axis sympathizers. 6 For example, on January 14, 1942, five controlling senior executives of General Aniline and Film Corporation, America's thi rd-largest dyestuff man- ufacturer, were banned from the company by the Trea sury Department. All were American citizens, but of German birth, and ha d for years been sus- pected of close ties to the German conglomerate I.G . Farbenindustrie. The suspicion was that I.G. Farben either secretly owne d Aniline, or could domi- nate it through the five German-Americans. 7 On March 26, 1942, a Congressional Committee castig ated Standard Oil of New Jersey for turning over synthetic rubber processes to the German Navy while withholding the same technical informati on from the United States and British militaries. Investigators cited company correspondence and a secret pre-Pearl Harbor trade arrangement wit h I.G. Farbenindustrie to permit a \"modus vivendi which would operate thro ugh the term of the war, whether or not the United States came in.\" Sen ator Harry Truman, who headed up a special defense investigating committee , publicly excoriated Standard Oil's arrangement as \"treason\" and \"an out rage.\" An assistant U.S. attorney general described the pact as a \"devise fo r the continuation of the conspiracy through the war.\" In reporting the scand al, the New York Times ran an adjacent article headlined \"Standard Oil Men Sil ent on Charges.\" 8 Further revelations documented that Standard Oil tr ied to do business with Nazi firms in Occupied France, including the c onstruction of an aviation fuel refinery. In its allegations against Standard Oil, the Justice Department repeatedly emphasized that scores of American compa nies had been quietly"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"capitalizing on relationships with Nazi Germany. I n fact, said the Justice Department, Farben alone had consummated contracts with more than 100 hundred American firm, and that those efforts had r etarded America's mili- tary preparedness by tying up patents and resources . 9 Certainly scores of American firms used internation al connections to trade with the enemy. None of them needed more than their own profit motive to pursue such deals. Many of them were prou d members of the International Chamber of Commerce, which, during Wa tson's tenure, es- poused an official enthusiasm for trade with the Hi tler regime. Ironically, none of IBM's subsidiaries were on the Proclaimed List be- cause they fell into a double-edged corporate ident ity as \"American-owned property.\" The same applied to all American-owned s ubsidiaries in Axis- controlled lands. So even though corporate parents, such as IBM, were not permitted to communicate with their own subsidiarie s because they were in Axis territory, these companies were deemed America n property to be pro- tected. In fact, since IBM only leased the machines , every Dehomag machine, whether deployed at the Waffen-SS office in Dachau or an insurance office in Rome, was considered American property to be protec ted. 10 Hence, Dehomag could simultaneously exist as a U.S. interest and a tool of the Nazis doing business with the same Farben an d Siemens entities that brought other American companies utter denunciation and often prosecution. The confusion and inconsistency inherent in the cla ssification of IBM subsidiaries as \"friend or foe\" was evident virtual ly every time the matter was raised. For example, on June 16, 1942, the American Consul in Bern asked that IBM's Swiss subsidiary, Watson A.G., not be bl acklisted. \"This is an American firm,\" wrote the Consul, \"and American int erests would probably suffer should it be listed. Axis firms would profit by the listing because it is believed that they have in stock a substantial numb er of office machines manufactured in Germany and exported to countries l ater occupied by Ger- many and Italy. . . . Such machines have already re ached the Swiss markets carrying instructions for assembly, use, etc. in th e Spanish, Yugoslav, Ruman- ian, etc., languages. . . . This Consulate General concurs . . . that Watson A.G. should not be listed.\" 11 No wonder the British Foreign Office was increasing ly disturbed at America's blacklisting inconsistencies. One confide ntial memo from the British Embassy regarding the blacklist evoked a ha ndwritten marginal note: \"It is only too clear that where U.S. trade interes ts are involved, these are being allowed to take precedence over 'hemispheric defense,' and . . . over cooperation with us.\" 12 "},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"Because the legalities were so gray, and IBM so ste llar an American concern, Carter was not permitted to work with much speed. Alleging treach- erous business when the firm was as prominent as IB M, and its leader as well connected to the White House as Watson, was not to be undertaken lightly by any branch of the U.S. government. So Carter was unable to obtain a subpoena. But he w as allowed to visit IBM headquarters and conduct interviews in mid-July 1943. To prepare for his visit, Carter typed an outline with nine topics . His emphasis was how IBM could not just lease products but actually cont rol its customers. Topic 1 on Carter's typed oudine: \"Importance of the [Dehom ag] plant for the efficient management of the German war machine.\" To pic 2: \"Cards im- ported from the United States per year.\" Topic 3, w ith a checkmark: \"The source of raw materials with particular emphasis on the possible bottleneck in supplying paper pulp for the manufacture of card s.\" Topic 7: \"Control exercised by IBM over their customers through the p olicy of renting equip- ment and the sale of cards.\" 13 A second list of ten typed questions focused stricd y on Dehomag facto- ries in Sindelfingen and Lichterfelde.

Schotte, IBM's New York-based General Manager for Europe, in the c ompany's headquarters. Although Schotte, a Dutch national, was the firm's European General Man- ager, he was permanently stationed in New York. Fro m his office at IBM NY headquarters, Schotte continued to regularly mainta in communication with IBM subsidiaries in Nazi territory, such as his nat ive Holland and Belgium. 15 Carter found Schotte a font of information. The int erview lasted three days. During that time, Carter scribbled copious no tes about IBM customers, uses for Hollerith machines, paper suppliers, biogr aphies of leading IBM and Dehomag personalities, and terms of use. Since Cart er represented the Jus- tice Department, his request to examine hundreds of pages of material was complied with. 16 Carter perused collections of documents, allowing h im to piece together an extraordinary global enterprise, one that in Eur ope centered on Nazi Ger- many.

Up-to-date customer account information enumerated long lists of machines and rental prices, as well as specific war applications. Card consumption figures summa- rized the volume both by country of manufacture and country of import, all organized by year. Most of all, anyone could discer n the ease and frequency of contact IBM maintained with foreign branches. 17 Clearly, IBM NY possessed a wealth of detailed info rmation about its overseas operations, from CEC to Dehomag to the uni ts peppered through- out the Balkans. Carter was able to type twenty-fiv e pages of notes based just on his three days of interviews with Schotte. A sig nificant portion of those notes centered on two aspects: IBM's ability to man age all aspects of the rail- roads of Europe, from identification of freight to scheduling, and IBM's incontrovertible control of punch cards. In the case of the railroads, Carter learned that t he Nazis could not schedule cargo or locate a boxcar or locomotive wit hout Hollerith cards. \"The German government,\" Carter wrote, \"is at prese nt partly subsidizing freight shipments . . . dependent upon IBM machines in such a way that if the card system were not permitted to function, the railroads would be unable to ascertain that portion of the expense whi ch the government had contracted to bear. . . . Statistics as to the expe nse to the railroad of freight running between certain points depends upon the car d system. In allocating freight charges between railroad systems in differe nt countries, the cards are invaluable.\" 18 Carter continued, \"the location of the number of tr ains available in a particular territory can be ascertained, which reco rd would only be about two days late. The only other method would be a spo t check which would be two weeks late and, of course, in any system such a s a railroad with the tremendous flux of traffic, a two-week gap would be worthless.\" 19 Regarding punch cards, Carter noted, \"In the manufa cture of cards, special machinery is needed. No one but an IBM affi liate can make IBM cards because in Germany the contracts contain a cl ause that the German customer cannot use cards except those of IBM manuf acture. ... At present, with paper shortages, stockpiles are probably not p ermitted for more than one month. The replacement requirements of cards ar e tremendous.\" 20 Carter was even able to comprehend IBM's controvers ial \"royalty\" agreement. \"A peculiar situation arises with regard to the Dehomag com- pany,\" recorded Carter, \"in that here is an almost completely owned sub-"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"sidiary which, in addition to paying the usual stoc k dividend, is also required to pay royalties to the American company. . . . How ever, probably, the true explanation is that the legal limits of stock divid ends prevented IBM from getting the return it wanted from the German compan y, and hence this is a method devised for additional returns.\" 21 Clearly, if he could reconstruct as much as he did with a simple request, a full search was called for. Carter returned, this time for a systematic \"file search.\" But he was still hobbled by the lack of a subpoena; his superiors would still not approve one. As such, he was depend ent upon the voluntary cooperation of the very people he was investigating . 22 In IBM's warehouse, at 75 Murray Street in Manhatta n, Carter found ten file drawers. Files were arranged alphabeticall y by country covering the years 1934 to 1940. They contained correspondence r elating to punch card production, machine and parts inventories, tariff f iles, repair records, cus- tomer complaints, lists of international fairs and visitors entertained. 23 But where were the key European files listing \"the customer, location, type of business, ownership ... card consumption an d name of salesman\" for each machine? Most importandy, where were the \"appl ication studies,\" that is, the specific analysis of each machine's purpose , how well it performed its task, and how it could improve? Schotte's answer: a ll those records were located in the offices of IBM Geneva. 24 Where were the records for 1933? Schotte's answer: destroyed. 25 At IBM World Headquarters, 590 Madison Avenue, Cart er first asked for Schotte's files. But now, cooperation had subst antially narrowed. Carter was not permitted to examine the actual file drawer s. Instead, Schotte brought the folders into his office for Carter's re view. Again, all the files were arranged alphabetically by country. The covered yea rs spanned 1940 to IBM's most recent correspondence, containing monthl y narrative reports by subsidiary, the details of the IBM machine installa tions, and \"in many instances, applications of the machines.\" But no \"a pplication studies\" were found for Germany, France, or Japan. 26 Where were the copies of Schotte's personal corresp ondence with the subsidiaries? Schotte's answer: none were in Americ a—they were all kept in the files of the various subsidiaries. 27 Hence, to examine Schotte's instructions, Carter wo uld have to travel to all the capitals of Europe. Second, Carter asked for the files of Fred Nichol, executive vice presi- dent and general manager of IBM. Nichol was second- in-command to Wat- son, continuously in touch with Harrison K. Chauncey, W C. Lier, and others"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"in Europe, and had for years maintained daily scrut iny over foreign opera- tions. Nichol's files were arranged chronologically from 1936 to 1942, but again Carter could not review the entire file. Cart er noted, \"I was not permit- ted to take the material from the general file, but the material was chosen for me.\" Schotte explained that whatever was brought ou t \"comprises the entire file on the foreign subsidiaries.\" 28 Nichol's files contained analyses of sales performa nce and quotas, per- sonnel problems, operating efficiencies at overseas branches, general records of business volume, and details of foreign visitors including \"Good Will Ambassadors.\" Nothing was available on operations i n Germany, France, or Italy that was not shown on Carter's previous visit s. 29 Third, Carter wanted to see Watson's files. Again, Carter was not per- mitted to examine the actual file location. Instead , twenty-six folders cover- ing the years from 1938 to 1942 were brought into S chotte's office. Schotte presented the folders as \"the complete file.\" They included details of Wat- son's tour as ICC president, lists of top sales ach ievers, copies of overseas information previously given, correspondence involv ing tax rates and sub- sidiary voting shares, letters from and about frien ds moving from Europe to the Americas, and exchanges of Season's Greetings. 30 Where was all of Watson's business correspondence? Schotte's answer: Since Watson traveled in Europe extensively, \"much of the business was transacted orally.\" If written materials did exist, then they would be in Geneva. 31 Carter left IBM's offices with little. He typed a n ote to file: Because of the meager information contained in the files, especially on the European subsidiaries, it is reasonable to assume t hat either the important files are in the offices of the European headquarte rs in Geneva, Switzerland, or IBM has not made full disclosure. 32 ALTHOUGH WATSON had been America's chief peace exponent during the Hitler years before Pearl Harbor, he had prepared f or the day when the United States would enter the conflict. As early as August 1940, the War De- partment began speaking to Watson about converting IBM's manufacturing muscle to war use—but not for Holleriths. The War D epartment wanted IBM to make machine guns. 33 On March 31, 1941, long before the U.S. was attacke d, Watson had incorporated a new subsidiary, Munitions Manufactur ing Corporation. The"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"president of a long-time IBM supplier was designate d president Two small canning buildings were purchased for $201,546. With in sixty days of the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, Watson unveil ed a fully equipped 140,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, staffed by 250 employees. The first product was a 20mm anti-aircraft cannon. Eventually , Munitions Manufactur- ing Corporation produced approximately thirty-two d ifferent weapons and other military items, including Browning automatic rifles, gas masks, bomb- sights, 90mm anti-aircraft gun directors, and 345,5 00 units of the 30-caliber M1 carbine rifle. IBM logos were stamped on most of the products, including the carbine rifle butts. By 1943, eventually two-th irds of IBM's entire factory capacity had shifted from tabulators to munitions. 34 More than just a manufacturer, IBM undertook sophis ticated research on ninety-nine strategic military research projects , including ballistics trajec- tory studies, aircraft design, automated inventory control, transportation routing, aircraft fire control systems, and an adva nced wireless, electronic messaging unit called Radiotype. 35 One special defense project involved an experimenta l system requested by the Army Air Corps. It needed a device that coul d read holes in tele- graphic paper and translate the results to punch ca rds. Watson was ready for such a request because he had already produced a pr eliminary design for a company identified as \"National Analine.\" IBM did n ot complete the work for \"National Analine\" and instead transferred the proj ect to the U.S. military. 36 IBM also developed powerful mobile Hollerith units transported in thirty-foot rubber-padded trailers pulled by 2.5-to n tractors. The first sixteen mobile units were delivered by spring 1942 with mor e than 260 similar such units deployed throughout the war. In the Pacific, mobile Holleriths were hopscotched from one Pacific atoll to the next. In the European theatre, Hollerith vans were brought ashore in Tunisia and S icily along with all other mobile equipment. Understanding their strategic val ue, the German High Command had issued priority orders to capture such a unit, with its crew, if possible. That never happened. 37 Machine Record Units [MRUs] were nothing less than IBM-trained military units specializing in deploying IBM-made e quipment. They were also designated to help capture any Holleriths disc overed in Europe or the Pacific theatre. A typical MRU detachment was staf fed by twenty-nine enlisted men and three officers proficient in punch card operations. To churn out the MRUs, IBM's school at Endicott was converte d into a military acad- emy where about 1,300 soldiers were trained to use Holleriths under war conditions. Many of these units were commanded and serviced by IBM"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"employees on leave. They formed a cohesive group of troops, affe ctionately called \"IBM Soldiers\", with distinct loyalties to t heir company and Watson. 38 These IBM Soldiers would have special roles when th ey came upon IBM fac- tories in Europe. To coordinate IBM's dozens of war projects for the U.S., Watson cre- ated his own corporate \"Department of Logistics.\" T his company bureau helped IBM focus its resources on some of America's most sensitive military projects. Watson appointed IBM General Manager Nich ol head of this department. Ironically, Nichol was at the same time overseeing IBM's foreign operations in Nazi Europe. Watson explained that Ni chol \"is eminendy fitted for this important work by reason of his broad exec utive experience ... com- bined with military knowledge.\" He added, \"He has i ntimate knowledge of foreign industrial methods and resources.\" 39 IBM and its technology were in fact involved in the Allies' most top- secret operations. The Enigma code crackers at Blet chley Park in England used Hollerith machines supplied by IBM's British l icensee, the British Tabu- lating Machine Company. Hut 7 at Bletchley Park was known as the Tabulating Machine Section. As early as January 1941, the Brit ish Tabulating Machine Company was supplying machines and punch cards not only to Bletchley Park, but to British intelligence units in Singapor e and Cairo as well. 40 By May 1942, IBM employees had joined America's own cryptographic service. A key man was Steve Dunwell, who left Endi cott's Commercial Re- search Department to join other code breakers in Wa shington, D.C. The group used a gamut of punch card machines made by I BM as well as Rem- ington Rand to decipher intercepted Axis messages. Captured enemy code books were keyed into punch cards using overlapping strings of fifty digits. The punched cards were sorted. Each deciphered word was used to attack another word until a message's context and meaning could laboriously be established. At one point, Dunwell needed a special machine with electro- mechanical relays that could calculate at high spee d the collective probability of words that might appear in a theoretical message bit. Dunwell sought per- mission from Watson to ask that the device be assem bled at IBM. Watson granted it. Later, Watson rewarded Dunwell for his service to the nation by allowing him to spend his honeymoon in Watson's per sonal suite at the IBM Country Club. 41 It was an irony of the war that IBM equipment was u sed to encode and decode for both sides of the conflict. 42 IBM was there even when the Allies landed at Norman dy on June 6, 1944. Hollerith machines were continuously used by the Weather Division of"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"the Army Air Forces to monitor and predict t h e temp estuous storms afflicting the English Channel. When A l l i e d troops finally lan ded at Normandy, MRUs went in soon after the beachhead was secured. 43 War had always been good to IBM. In America, war in come was with- out equal. Within ninety days of Pearl Harbor, Wats on was able to inform the media that IBM had secured more than $150 million i n munitions and other defense contracts. Total wartime sales and rentals tripled from approximately $46 million annually in 1940 to approximately $140 million annually by 1945. 44 IBM machines were not just used to wage war. They w ere also used to track people. Holleriths organized millions for the draft. Allied soldiers miss- ing in action, as well as captured Axis prisoners, were cataloged by IBM sys- tems. The location of every serviceman anywhere in the world, from George S. Patton to the most anonymous buck private, could be determined by punching a request into a Hollerith. All military p ayments were automated and continuously distributed by IBM tabulators. A N ational Roster of Scien- tific and Specialized Personnel was assembled to ai d in the war effort. 45 A central reason IBM machines could yield such extr aordinary people tracking capabilities in America arose from its ext ensive use in the 1940 cen- sus. This census asked a number of detailed, person al questions. A national campaign of gentle persuasion was launched to convi nce people to provide the answers. In one radio address, First Lady Elean or Roosevelt promoted the 1940 census as \"the greatest assemblage of fact s ever collected by any people about the things that affect their welfare.\" She acknowledged, \"Much doubt has been raised as to the propriety of some o f the questions.\" But, she added, they were designed to yield \"facts which wil l provide illuminating data on problems which have become particularly pre ssing.\" 46 On Sunday, December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl H arbor. Within forty-eight hours, the Bureau of the Census publish ed its first report on Japa- nese Americans entitled Japanese Population of the United States, Its Territories and Possessions. The next day it published Japanese Population by Nativity and Citizenship in Selected Cities of the United States . On December 10, it released a third report, Japanese Population in the Pacific Coast States by Sex, Nativity and Citizenship, by Counties. Using IBM application s, the Census Bureau had tracked the racial ancestry of Japanese Americans b ased on their responses to the 1940 census. 47 Census Director J. C. Capt confirmed, \"we didn't wa it for the [Ameri- can] declaration of war [which was proclaimed Monda y afternoon, Decem- ber 8]. On Monday morning, we put our people to wor k on the Japanese"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"thing.\" Since only 135,430 Japanese Americans lived in the United States, the results were tabulated quickly. A single sort was n ecessary: race. 48 Divulging specific addresses was illegal. So the Ce nsus Bureau pro- vided information that located Japanese-American co ncentration within spe- cific census tracts. Census tracts were geographic areas generally yielding 4,000 to 8,000 citizens. When necessary, the Census Bureau could provide even finer detail: so-called \"enumeration districts ,\" and in some cities \"census blocks.\" With this information, the American govern ment could focus its search in select communities along the West Coast—e ven if it did not have the exact names and addresses. 49 A Census Bureau official explained to a federal com mission that he was happy to provide \"a detailed cross-tabulation for e ven the most minute areas . . . for which data were collected. In other words , enumeration districts and in some instances cities by blocks. . . . Sheets of paper from the tabulation machines were sent out to WCCA [Wartime Civil Contr ol Administration, which was responsible for the internment] . . . and became the basis for the WCCA statistical activities.\" 50 The maps displaying Japanese population density wer e marked with dots, one for each ten persons. American and Dutch census bureaus simulta- neously used Hollerith systems in 1943 to create ra cial \"dot maps\" as a means of organizing transfers to concentration camps. Hol lerith experts dedicated to such projects seemed to work according to an est ablished protocol on either side of the Adantic, almost as though they h ad the same consultant. Lentz and his colleagues published highly detailed articles describing their registration programs. These articles appeared not only in Dutch statistical journals, but were translated into German for the j ournal of the German Sta- tistical Society, and then translated into English for the journal of the Ameri- can Statistical Association. The Journal of the Ame rican Statistical Association was regularly read by everyone in the American stat istical community as well as the engineers and consultants at IBM. 51 If locating the Japanese by census block was insuff icient, the Census Bureau was willing to take the next step to deliver actual names and addresses. \"We're by law required to keep confident ial information by indi- viduals,\" Census Director Capt declared at the time . He added, \"But in the end, [i]f the defense authorities found 200 Japs mi ssing and they wanted the names of the Japs in that area, I would give them f urther means of checking individuals.\" 52 By February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt could con fidently sign Exec- utive Order 9066 authorizing the internment of Japa nese Americans on the"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"West Coast. On March 22, 1942, the evacuations bega n in Los Angles. The U.S. Supreme Court later upheld the legality of suc h a measure based on ancestral grounds alone. 53 Ironically, on April 29, 1945, an all-Japanese-Amer ican regiment helped free Dachau. 54 Thomas Watson was more than the leader of one of Am erica's most val- ued wartime corporations. He seized the opportunity to become the nation's chief industrial patriot. Just as he had sermonized for peace during the thir- ties and early years of war before America's entry, Watson now epitomized the loyal warrior capitalist. As early as January 1 941, Watson had assured re- porters, \"The leaders of government, business and i ndustry to whom the execution of our defense program has been entrusted will have the loyal cooperation of every businessman in the United Stat es. We are willing to make sacrifices to achieve this, because we appreci ate our privileges as Amer- ican citizens and will always stand together in def ense of our form of gov- ernment and our American ideals, while also endeavo ring to assist and cooperate with all right-thinking people throughout the world.\" 55 On Independence Day, 1941, Watson reported that dur ing the previous six weeks he had helped stage theatrical performanc es for more than 650,000 American soldiers and sailors stationed at sixty posts. As chairman of the Citizens Committee for the Army and Navy, Wa tson raised funds among major industrialists to entertain the troops. This included a substan- tial donation of his own. 56 On July 15, 1941, Watson declared, \"We are a peace- loving people and we love peace to such an extent that we are willing to fight for it. We cherish our civilization in this country above everything e lse and we are going to be adequately prepared to protect it and to continue t o develop it.\" 57 In October 1941, Watson's Citizens Committee helped Eleanor Roose- velt organize a \"Knit for Defense\" tea at the Waldo rf-Astoria. At the event, he introduced the First Lady as \"the first knitter.\" 58 Throughout 1941, even as Watson was broadcasting ji ngoistic state- ments and organizing patriotic services, he was als o waging his own private war against the Dehomag revolt. However, his strugg le to remain in the Axis war machine did not deter him from continuing to mo bilize America. In 1942, Watson purchased full-page display ads in leading newspapers proclaiming his great \"WE-ALL.\" The few lines of la rge type beneath the head- line \"WE-ALL\" exhorted: \"Our slogan now is WE-ALL, which means every loyal individual in the United States. We are facin g a long, hard job, but when the United States decides to fight for a cause , it is in terms of WE-ALL,"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"and nothing can or will stop us. President Roosevel t, our Commander-in- Chief, can be certain that WE-ALL are back of him, determined to protect our country, our form of government, and the freedo ms which we cherish.\" The advertisements bore the thick, swashing signatu re of Thomas J. Watson as \"President, International Business Machines Corp oration.\" 59 Watson's patriotic crusade never diminished in ferv or. It wasn't just cor- porate. It was personal. In 1943, as Harold J. Carter sat in IBM's offices a t 590 Madison Avenue, he was investigating more than a powerful b usiness. Carter never had a chance. He was going against a corporation th at was intensely vital to almost every aspect of the U.S. war effort, includi ng its most secret opera- tions, and against executives who occupied the glit tering apex of America's rally for defense. In fact, Watson had even decline d a recent Democratic sug- gestion to run for Governor of New York. 60 No wonder Schotte could decide what documents Carter would and would not receive. IBM and Watson were untouchable. Carter learned the immutable truth in the very words he had written months earlier: This [World War] is a conflict of warlike nationali stic states, each having cer- tain interests. Yet we frequently find these intere sts clashing diametrically with the opposing interests of international corpor ate structures, more huge and powerful than nations. IBM was in some ways bigger than the war. Both side s could not afford to proceed without the company's all-important tech nology. Hitler needed IBM. So did the Allies. By late 1943, Carter learned that whether he concur red or not, IBM was not to be treated as a suspect corporation trad ing with the enemy, but as a precious war asset in the Allied struggle for liberty. IBM now entered a wholly new phase. Since all of Nazi Europe administ ratively functioned with Holleriths, IBM's help would be crucial to the post -war control of Europe's administrative and economic infrastructure. Simply put: IBM had the keys to Europe—or rather the cards. Now, all its expertise in punch card technol- ogy would be utilized to create an orderly conquest and liberation of the Continent. Carter's Economic Warfare Section now regularly tur ned to IBM to learn the many intricacies of German and Italian Ho llerith use—not for the purposes of criminal prosecution or documenting cul pability, but for the purposes of military intelligence and sustaining Al lied victory."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"In December 1943 Carter prepared a memo entitled \"U se of Mecha- n i z e d Accounting Systems in Axis and A x i s Occupied Territory\" based com- pletely on information gleaned from Schotte and oth er IBM executives. Carter's focus had now shifted, recording the detai ls of Hollerith deployment in Nazi Holland, Germany, and Italy, including the street addresses of major punch card processing agencies and repositories. Fo r example, his memo pin- pointed the Ministry of Corporations at Via Vittori o Veneto in Rome as main- taining \"complete records in punch card form of all Italian industrial commercial, transportation, and agricultural enterp rises, together with the employment and vocational records of all personnel engaged in these enter- prises. By putting the punched cards and business m achines at this location to use, it would be possible to secure quickly and accurately\" a long list of operational information needed to control a post-wa r occupied Italy. 61 The memo similarly listed key data bureaus in Holla nd and Germany. Carter stressed that IBM subsidiaries supplied and helped organize all the enemy installations. He closed with the observation : \"In order to utilize the data located in the governmental agencies described above, it is suggested that special measures be instituted in conjunction with the military authori- ties to seize and safeguard the punch cards and bus iness machines in these offices. These measures might include the constitut ing of a special unit with detailed knowledge of the applications of business machines and punch cards . . . and a prearranged plan of action.\" 62 One of Carter's colleagues, Harold Ungar, prepared another confidential memo further outlining the new approach. 'The Germa n Government,\" wrote Ungar, \"through the intensive use of standardized a ccounting practices and business machines, has achieved a highly centralize d control of the financial and industrial activities of Germany and of the occ upied countries. This con- trol is so centralized that a sudden collapse of th e German Government may produce such chaos in the functioning of the German economy as to make extremely difficult whatever administration the All ied authorities may seek to impose [after the war]. Whatever system the occupat ion authorities intend to adopt, therefore, one action with high priority is to prepare in advance to seize and utilize the existing German economic cont rol apparatus.\" 63 IBM had come full circle. The firm had now become a strategic partner in the war against the Third Reich—even as it conti nuously supplied the enemy, as before, through its overseas subsidiaries . Carter's investigation was finished. The crusade to save the machines was on. Carter now produced memo after memo—hundreds of pag es—de- tailing the inner workings of Dehomag, Watson Itali ana, and the way the"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"Third Reich ran railroads and organized military op erations across Europe using punch cards. The complete blueprint of Nazi G ermany Holleriths was documented. His investigative reports were converte d into operational man- uals for both invasion forces and the civilian admi nistrators who would fol- low. As late as June 1944, Carter's section was eve n able to learn from an IBM executive that critical economic policy files o f the Nazi Party had been reduced to punch cards which could be reconstructed if recovered. IBM knew where they were: in Veesenmayer's office. 64 For the Allies, IBM assistance came at a crucial po int. But for the Jews of Europe it was too late. Hitler's Holleriths had been deployed against them for almost a decade and were continuing without aba tement. Millions of Jews would now suffer the consequences of being ide ntified and processed by IBM technologies. After nearly a decade of incremental solutions the Third Reich was ready to launch the last stage. In January 1942, a conference was held in Wannsee outside Berlin. This conference, supported by Reich statisticians and Hollerith experts, would outline the Final Solu tion of the Jewish prob- lem in Europe. Once more, Holleriths would be used, but this time the Jews would not be sent away from their offices or congre gated into ghettos. Ger- many was now ready for mass shooting pits, gas cham bers, crematoria, and an ambitious Hollerith-driven program known as \"ext ermination by labor\" where Jews were systematically worked to death like spent matches. For the Jews of Europe, it was their final encounte r with German automation."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"XIII EXTERMINATION NEARLY EVERY NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMP OPERATED A Hollerith Department known as the Hollerith Abtei lung. The three- part Hollerith system of paper forms, punch cards, and tab- ulators varied from camp to camp and from year to y ear, depending upon conditions. In some camps, such as Dachau and Storkow, as many as two dozen IBM sorters, tabulators, and printers were in stalled. 1 Other facilities operated punches only and submitted thei r cards to cen- tral locations such as Mauthausen or Berlin; in som e camps, the plain paper forms were coded and processed elsewher e. 2 Hollerith activity—whether paper, punching, or processing, wa s frequendy lo- cated within the camp itself, consigned to a specia l bureau called the Labor Assignment Office, known in German as the Arbeitsein- satz. 3 The Arbeitseinsatz issued the all-important daily work assign- ments, and processed all inmate cards and labor tra nsfer rosters. This necessitated a constant traffic of lists, punc h cards, and en- codeable documents as every step of the prisoner's existence was regimented and tracked. 4 Hitler's Reich established camps all over Europe, b ut they were not all alike. Some, such as Flossenburg in Germany , were labor camps where inmates were worked to death. Several, such as Wester- bork in Holland, were transit camps, that is, stagi ng sites en route to"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"other destinations. A number of camps, such as Treb linka in Poland, were op- erated for the Hole purpose of immediate exterminat ion by gas chamber. Some camps, such as Auschwitz, combined elements of all three. 5 Without IBM's machinery, continuing upkeep and serv ice, as well as the supply of punch cards, whether located on-site or o ff-site, Hitler's camps could have never managed the numbers they did. The major camps were assigned Hollerith code number s for their paper- work: Auschwitz . . . 001; Buchenwald . . . 002; Da chau . . . 003; Flossenburg . .. 004; Gross-Rosen . . . 005; Herzogenbusch . . . 006; Mauthausen ...007; Natzweiler . . . 008; Neuengamme . . . 009; Ravensb ruck . . . 010; Sachsen- hausen ... 011; Stutthof... 012. 6 Auschwitz, coded 001, was not a single camp, but a sprawling complex, comprised of transit facilities, slave factories an d farms, gas chambers, and crematoria. In most camps, the Arbeitseinsatz tabul ated not only work assign- ments, but also the camp hospital index and the gen eral death and inmate sta- tistics for the Political Section. But at Auschwitz , paper data was probably shipped off-site, perhaps to another camp, such as Mathausen, for processing. 7 In August 1943, a timber merchant from Bendzin, Pol and, arrived among a group of 400 inmates, mostly Jews. First, a docto r examined him briefly to determine his fitness for work. His physical inform ation was noted on a med- ical record for the \"camp hospital index.\" Second, his full prisoner registra- tion was completed with all personal details. Third , his name was checked against the indices of the Political Section to see if he would be subjected to special cruelty. Finally, he was registered by Holl erith method in the labor index for the Arbeitseinsatz and assigned a charact eristic five-digit Hollerith number, 44673. 8 This five-digit number would follow the Polish mer chant from labor assignment to assignment as Hollerith sy stems tracked him and his availability for work, and reported it to the centr al inmate file kept at Depart- ment DII. Department DII of the SS Economics Admini stration in Oranien- burg oversaw all camp slave labor assignments. 9 Later in the summer of 1943, the timber merchant's same five-digit Hollerith number, 44673, was tattooed on his forear m. Eventually, during the summer of 1943, all non-Germans at Auschwitz we re similarly tattooed. 10 Tattoos, however, quickly evolved at Auschwitz. Soo n, they bore no fur- ther relation to Hollerith compatibility for one re ason: the Hollerith number was designed to track a working inmate—not a dead o ne. Once the daily death rate at Auschwitz climbed, Hollerith-based nu mbering simply became outmoded. Clothes would be quickly removed from any cadaver, making iden- tification for the Hollerith-maintained death lists difficult. So camp numbers"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"were inked onto a prisoner's chest. But as th e ches t became obscured amidst growing mounds of dead bodies, the forearm was pref erred as a more visible appendage. Soon, ad hoc numbering systems were inau gurated at Auschwitz. Various number ranges, often with letters attached, were assigned to prisoners in ascending sequence. Dr. Josef Mengele, who perfo rmed bizarre experi- ments, tattooed his own distinct number series on p atients. Tattoo numbering ultimately took on a chaotic incongruity all its ow n as an internal Auschwitz- specific identification system. 11 . But Hollerith numbers remained the chief method Ber lin employed to centrally identify and track prisoners at Auschwitz . For example, in late 1943, some 6,500 healthy, working Jews were ordered to th e gas chamber by the SS. But their murder was delayed for two days as th e Political Section metic- ulously checked each of their numbers against the S ection's own card index. The Section was under orders to temporarily repriev e any Jews with traces of Aryan parentage. 12 Sigismund Gajda was processed by the three-step Hol lerith system. Born in Kielce, Poland, Gajda was about forty years of age when on May 18, 1943, he arrived at Auschwitz. A paper form, labele d \"Personal Inmate Card,\" recorded all of Gajda's personal information. He pr ofessed Roman Catho- licism, had two children, and his work skill was ma rked \"mechanic.\" The reverse side of his Personal Inmate Card listed nin e previous work assign- ments. At the bottom of the card's front panel was a column to list any physi- cal punishments meted out, such as flogging, tree-b inding, or beating. Once Gajda's card was processed, a large indicia in typi cal Nazi Gothic script letters was rubber-stamped at the bottom: Hollerith erfasst , or \"Hollerith registered.\" That designation was stamped in large letters on hu ndreds of thousands of processed Personal Inmate Cards at camps all across Europe. 13 Auschwitz's print shops produced the empty plain pa per Personal Inmate Cards for Hollerith operations at most other concentration camps. Sometimes the Auschwitz presses simply could not ke ep up with demand. In one instance, on October 14, 1944, the leader of Ra vensbriick's Hollerith Department sent a letter to his counterpart at Flos senburg's Hollerith Depart- ment confirming that a work gang of 200 females had been dispatched for slave labor at the Witt Company in Helmbrechts. \"Th e inmates' personal cards as well as the Hollerith transfer lists are b eing submitted,\" the Ravens- bruck officer leader wrote. But, he added, \"Since a t the moment, no [Inmate] Cards can be obtained from the Auschwitz printers, temporary cards had to be made for that part of the transport.\" 14 All Auschwitz inmate information, including workers still alive, deaths,"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"and transferees, was continuously punched into the Hollerith system servic- ing the camp. Tabulated totals were wired each day to the SS Economics A d m i n i s t r a t i o n and other offices in Berlin by the various camp Hollerith Departments. Hollerith tracking was the only system for monitoring the con- stantly shifting total population of all camps. 15 The \"Central Inmate File\" at the SS Economics Admin istration was a mere paper file, but all its information was punche d into the central Hollerith banks in Berlin and Oranienburg. Each prisoner was tracked with a single paper card boldly labeled at the top Haftlingskarte , that is, \"Inmate Card.\" That paper card was filled with personal informatio n handwritten in fields next to the corresponding Hollerith code numbers to be punched into IBM equipment. No names were used to identify prisoners in this file—only their assigned Hollerith numbers, generally five digits l ong, but often six digits. Each five- or six-digit number was coupled with a c oncentration camp num- ber. Hence, each camp could potentially register 99 9,999 inmates. 16 For instance, one nameless inmate was assigned the six-digit number, 057949, which was to be punched into columns 22 and 27 of a Hollerith card. He was born on October 7, 1907, which was punched i nto section 5. The Secu- rity Police, which was coded 1 for column 2, took t he man into custody in the town of Metz, which was punched into a different ro w. November 11, 1943, was the arrest date, which was punched into section 3. Prisoner 057949 was marked as a Communist Spaniard, coded 6 for column 4. As a male, box 1 for column 6 was checked; but since he was unmarried, b ox 1 for column 7 was also checked; his one child necessitated an additio nal mark for column 8. Pris- oner 057949 was transferred to Dachau, coded \"03\" f or columns 21 and 26. 17 Along the bottom of Prisoner 057949's card was a se ries of lines for each concentration camp to which he was assigned. A t the right of each camp entry line was a grid marked Holl. Verm. for \"Holle rith Notation\" above two separates boxes: one marked \"In,\" and the next mark ed \"Out.\" 18 At the bottom right of every Inmate Card was a spec ial processing sec- tion labeled Kontrollvermerk. Under Kontrollvermerk were three boxes: ausgestellt for \"issued\" verschlusselt for \"encoded\" Lochk. gepruft for \"punch card verified.\" 19 The punch card operator's number was hand-stamped i n the \"punch card verified\" box to maintain quality control. 20 Millions of identical Inmate Cards were run through the system, all featuring co lumn-numbered data fields, the distinctive \"Hollerith Notation\" grid, and control boxes to certify"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"the punch card processing details. When a number ho lder deceased, Ins number was simply re-issued. Of the millions produc ed, more than a hun- dred thousand such Inmate Cards survived the war. 21 Hollerith tracking worked so well that the SS Econo mics Administra- tion was able to authoritatively challenge the slav e labor reports they were receiving on any given day. For instance, at one po int in the latter part of 1943, the central office asked for the number of Au schwitz Jews fit for reas- signment to an armaments plant. On August 29, Ausch witz replied that only 3,581 were available. Senior SS Economics Administr ation Officer Gerhard Maurer knew from DII's Hollerith sorts that fully 2 5,000 Jews were available for work transfers. Four days later, Maurer dispatc hed a brash rejoinder to Auschwitz Camp Commandant Rudolf Hoess himself. \"Wh at are the remain- ing 21,500 Jews doing?\" Maurer demanded. \"Something 's amiss here! Please again scrutinize this process and give a report.\" 22 Later, in January 1945, a number of Russian prisone rs were delivered to Auschwitz. Each of them was classed Nacht und Ne bel, which translated to 'Night and Fog,\" essentially designating them as co vert inmates. Nacht und Nebel Russians were coded 14 in Auschwitz records. 23 Hollerith Departments at camps could not be operate d by miscellaneous labor whether they used mere coded paper forms, car ds, or actual machines. They required so-called Hollerith experts trained b y an IBM subsidiary, either Dehomag in Germany, or any of the others depending upon location. At Auschwitz, the key man running the card index syste ms was Eduard Muller. Muller was a fat, aging, ill-kempt man, with brown hair and brown eyes. Some said, \"He stank like a polecat.\" A rabid Nazi, Mull er took special delight in harming inmates from his all-important position in camp administration. 24 Buchenwald, coded 002, was established in July 1937 , long before the war started. From its inception, Buchenwald was a c ruel destiny for Ger- many's social undesirables, including politicals, h ardened criminals, so-called work-shy misfits, Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, and Jews. Hollerith machines were needed from the outset to code and se gregate each type of inmate, and then ensure the prisoner was subjected to a regimen of maltreat- ment and deprivation prescribed for his category. 25 Ironically, when many Jews, homosexuals, and Jehova h's Witnesses reg- istered at Buchenwald, they were required to write \"career criminal\" on the front of their Personal Inmate Card as a welcoming humiliation ritual. Their real occupation was noted on the back. Those who ba lked at fisting them- selves as criminals were severely beaten. 26 So many hundreds of thousands of IBM cards, all wit h the characteris-"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"tic red Dehomag logo printed along the edge clicked through the Hollerith machines of Buchenwald, and its many sub-camps, tha t spent cards were typ- ically cut in half so the backs could be used for n ote pads. For example, the flip side of a punch card recording production deta ils at the Zwieberge sub- camp was re-used to request shift assignments. The commander scribbled on the back: please deploy Alfred and Schneider to Kom mando 1. \"They are to be transferred to a shift... in Block 12.\" 27 Deaths were so numerous at Buchenwald that the hosp ital staff jotted individual details on the back of used IBM cards. T ypically, the deceased in- mate's five- or six-digit number, sometimes with ba rracks number appended, was scrawled next to the name and nationality, next to two dates: entry into the hospital and death. German Prisoner 52234 entered A pril 11 and died April 12. French prisoner 71985 entered on April 14 and e xited on April 15. French Jewish prisoner 93190 entered April 14 and departed two days later. A tell- tale array of hole punches was always clearly visib le on these square scraps. 28 Dachau, coded 003, was the Reich's first organized concentration camp, established in March 1933 in the first weeks of the Hitler regime. Several detention camps had been erected early on. But Dach au, set up just ten kilo- meters from Munich, was the first Nazi camp created to inflict hellish cruelty on the Reich's undesirables, especially Communists and Jews. Offices of the merciless Waffen-SS and its predecessor organizatio ns, located at Dachau, utilized at least four multi-machine sets of IBM ma chines, including Deho- mag's most advanced. Waffen-SS units were militariz ed SS troops that actively participated in some of the bloodiest murders of th e war. 29 While Dachau was originally established for Germans , once the Reich conquered Europe, inmates from many countries were processed through its Hollerith machines. Middle-class Parisian prisoners were in abundance. Pris- oner 072851, a French salesman, was taken by the Se curity Police in Paris; Hollerith operator number 8 processed his card. Pri soner 072850, a chef, was also taken by the Security Police in Paris; Hol lerith operator number 8 also processed his card. Prisoner 072833 was a gard ener, taken by Security Police in Paris; Hollerith operator 8 punched his i nformation as well. The very next card in the sequence belonged to Prisoner 072834, a baker taken by Security Police in Paris; that card was punched by Hollerith operator 9. 30 Dachau's equipment was managed by several Hollerith experts and non-technical supervisors. Albert Bartels, head of the SS machine record agency, with no particular expertise, functioned as the senior official. Herbert Blaettel possessed the technical knowledge since he was a former Dehomag dealer and later worked in Dehomag's training depar tment. Blaettel was aided"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"by Heiber, considered a virulent SS man. Busch, ano ther technical expert, had been a Dehomag dealer since 1932 and finally jo ined the SS in 1943 to help the SS operate its machines. Because Dachau wa s just ten kilometers from Willy Heidinger's hometown near Munich, and th e well-established Dehomag branch office there, Dachau was always clos e to the epicenter of Hollerith automation development. For example, Dach au received Deho- mag's very first advanced alphabetizer, the DII-A. 31 Flossenburg, coded 004, was another camp built in G ermany before the war. The giant facility, built near the town of Floss, continuously worked inmates to death at a nearby granite quarry and Mes serschmitt aircraft fac- tory. When enfeebled prisoners by the thousands dro pped dead from malnu- trition and exhaustion, their bodies were quickly c remated. 32 Because Flossenbiirg was primarily a slave labor ca mp, it relied heavily on Hollerith machines to coordinate the work battal ions transferring in and Out from other major camps or its own sub-camps. Th e camp's well-developed Hollerith Department tracked its slaves by name and number. During Septem- ber 1944, thousands of prisoners were transferred t o Flossenbiirg proper from its smaller sub-camps. On September 1, 1944, for ex ample, Flossenbiirg's Hollerith Department received secret notice #1049/4 4, specifying that six of those sub-camps were transferring a total of 2,324 cards corresponding to the attached \"Hollerith Transfer Lists.\" From Camp Neurohlau: 561; from Camp Zwodau: 887; from Camp Graslitz: 150; from Hol leischen: 603; and from Camp Helmbrechts: 100. Seventeen women were al so transferred to a special Flossenbiirg detachment. The secret notice to Flossenbiirg's Hollerith Department explained: 'The inmates' files have been kept in the records of the local camps up until and including August 31, a s was already reported by telegram. The transfer lists for the Hollerith card file are attached as well.\" 33 Notice #1049/44 to Flossenbiirg also stressed that although 2,324 cards were accompanying the Hollerith transfer printouts, six women had escaped during the past few months. \"The inmates' files hav e been removed from the records of local camps, after their escape,\" the no tice instructed, \"and their records have to be reinserted into the files upon t heir capture.\" The six women were listed by name and Hollerith number: #22941 Basargina, Elena #23021 Edwokimenko, Diana #30279 Baranecka, Lena #28803 Krlanisch, Valentina #29306 Saganjatsch, Nadia #34434 Hildinberg, Gertru d 34 Printouts from Flossenbiirg's Hollerith Department were used to organ- ize and accompany the transfer not only of large sl ave groups numbering"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"more than 1,000 but small work gangs as well. On Ja nuary 24, 1945, Flos- senburg's Arbeitseinsatz received notice from anoth er camp's Hollerith Department: \"We are su b m i t t i n g inmate personal card s for 200 inmates transferred to work camp Helmbrechts and 200 inmate s transferred to work camp Dresden . . .

On November 13, 1944, Flossenbiirg's Arbeitseinsatz re ceived orders involving just four women: \"The inmate personal cards for 4 f emale inmates trans- ferred to work camp Helmbrechts on November 9, 1944 , as well as Hollerith transfer list Number 123 are submitted in the attac hment. We are requesting the speediest delivery of personal file cards for t he 4 transferred inmates.\" 36 Among the many punch card operations in concentrati on camps, per- haps the most active was the massive Hollerith Depa rtment at Mauthausen. The giant Austrian camp was really an extensive com plex of slave labor quar- ries and factories, operated with a brutal furor ca lculated to quickly work inmates to death. Sadistic labor conditions amid un speakable daily atrocities killed thousands. Numerous Mauthausen sub-camps fun ctioned as satellites in a similar vein. Moreover, as camps consolidated late in the war, captives were continuously shipped into the camp so Mauthaus en received many transfers from other facilities. Hollerith operator s located in the Arbeitsein- satz, across from the Political Section, could see the entire parade grounds, including the arrival of everiy prisoner transport. 37 A low-level SS officer supervised Mauthausen's Holl erith Department. But day-to-day sorts and tabulations were undertake n by a Russian-born French army lieutenant POW named Jean-Frederic Veit h. Veith arrived at Mauthausen on April 22, 1943, just days before his fortieth birthday. He was quickly assigned to the tabulators. Among Veith's d uties was processing the many Hollerith lists from other camps, not only tra nsferred prisoners for new assignment, but also those the sorts had determined were misrouted. 38 Veith compiled both the voluminous death lists and new arrival ros- ters, and then dispatched the daily \"strength numbe rs\" to Berlin. His section stamped each document Hollerith erfasst—\"Hollerith registered\"—and then incorporated the figures into the camp's burgeoning database. Hence, the"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"enormity of Mauthausen's carnage was ever-present i n his mind as he ran the machines. 89 Mauthausen \"Departure Lists\" were fundamentally rol l calls of the dead. A typical handwritten \"Departure List\" ran on for many pages, thirty lines per page. No names were used, just the inmate 's five- or six-digit Holle- rith identity, listed on the left in numerical orde r for efficient punching into column 22 of the Dehomag cards printed for camp dea th tallying. The vic- tim's birth date was penned into the next table for punching into section 5. Death dates were scrawled in the right field set as ide for section 25. 40 Cause of death was recorded for column 24. Generall y, the murdered inmate itemized on the top line was coded C-3, the Hollerith designation for \"natural causes.\" For convenience, ditto marks sign ifying \"natural causes\" would then be dashed next to every inmate number. B ut these death cita- tions were faked. For amusement, Mauthausen guards might force an inmate to jump off the quarry cliff at a spot called \"the Parachute Jump.\" Exhausted laborers might be crowded into the tiled gas chambe r below the sick bay where carbon monoxide billows would suffocate their lives. Undesirables might be terminated in \"Operation K\" actions—a bull et administered at close range. Or special cases might be hoisted by t heir arms tied behind their backs until they died from the socket-wrenching exc ruciation. All these mur- ders were almost always dittoed C-3, \"natural cause s.\" 41 The Hollerith installations at Auschwitz, Buchenwal d, Dachau, and Mauthausen were only part of an extensive network o f camp punching and tabulating services that stretched across Europe. A t Stutthof camp in subju- gated Poland, coded 012, the Hollerith Department u sed six-digit registrations beginning with zero. At the nightmarish Gusen camps , the Hollerith cards were not only set up to record personal biographica l and work assignments, they also recorded the gruesome details of painful punishments adminis- tered to prisoners, such as floggings and hanging f rom a tree with arms bound in back. At Westerbork transfer camp in Holla nd, Hitler's Holleriths were used to schedule efficient trainfuls of prison ers destined for Auschwitz gas chambers, and then report the numbers back to t he registration office. 42 At Bergen-Belsen, where surviving prisoners were de scribed by libera- tors as \"emaciated apathetic scarecrows huddled tog ether in wooden huts,\" the Hollerith cards were maintained in a barracks d ubbed \"the lion's den,\" located in the Arbeitseinsatz. To obliterate all ev idence of the mass murders documented by the Hollerith records, Himmler ordere d all camp card indices to be destroyed before the Allies arrived. 43 "},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"At Ravensbruck woman's camp, coded 010, the busy Ho llerith Depart- ment used its own \"Ravensbruck\" rubber stamp to sav e time w r i t i n g . Punch card operators at Ra v e n s b r u c k often identified thei r work by letter, rather than number. A stream of Hollerith transfer lists a lways accompanied Ravensbruck slave women transported to various fact ory sites and camps. One could live as long as one could work. Ravensbri ick women always knew fellow prisoners were about to be exterminated when a trusty abrupdy re- trieved their cards. One British inmate recalled in a secret letter written at the time, 'The selected ones have to wait in front of the Block . . . while the [trusty] . . . who has noted their numbers goes to the Arbeitseinsatz and gets their cards (which are only removed if the prisoner is dead). An hour later she returns with the cards and a lorry and they go— never to return.\" 44 The SS Economics Administration, under the leadersh ip of Gruppen- fuhrer Oswald Pohl, utilized Hollerith systems for more than specific prisoner tracking. IBM machinery helped the SS manage the ma ssive logistics of the entire camp system. Although millions, representing many nationalities and religions, were imprisoned at various times in hund reds of installations, the total camp capacity on any given day was between 50 0,000 and 700,000. 45 That required population management. Jews from acro ss Europe were being continuously transported into the camps. At the sam e time, slaves within camp confines died or reached the limits of their utilit y to the Reich. The prodigious task of efficiendy scheduling deportation from citi es and ghettos in many coun- tries, the daily work assignments, and outright ext ermination timetables would have been impossible without the daily strength rep orts. When the camps reached the maximum of even their inhumane overcrow ded capacity, orders went out from Berlin to reduce the density. Those p eriodic orders issued by the SS Economics Administration were based on the well- honed statistics provided by the Holleriths both in the camps and at camp adm inistration headquarters. 46 In fact, a special statistical bureau was eventuall y established in January 1944 to coordinate and tabulate all new registratio ns, death lists, daily strength reports, and transfers from site to site. This virtually unknown secret punch card facility was simply called Zentral Insti tut, that is, the \"Central In- stitute.\" Each day, camps would forward copies of t heir strength reports to Zentral Institut, located on a quiet, residential s treet in Block F at 129 Friedrichstrasse in Berlin. 47 Although the location was tranquil, the traffic in and out was constant. Couriers delivered weekly \"Departure Lists\" from th e various camps. For ex- ample, Mauthausen's list for week 37 of 1944 was si x pages long—virtually all deceased. For week 40, the list was seven pages long. For week 41, it was"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"six pages, recording 325 deaths. For week 44, seven pages listed 369 prisoners. An October 17, 1944, delivery of prisoner cards fro m Mauthausen's Hollerith Department included data on 6,969 males and 399 fem ales. 48 Zentral Institut, at Block F, 129 Friedrichstrasse, was able to render the big picture only because it processed the most indi vidualized details. For instance, on January 2, 1944, the SS officer in cha rge of Mauthausen's Holle- rith Department informed his counterparts at Flosse nburg's Hollerith Department about three named and numbered prisoners who had recendy transferred in. One died in transport and two other s were utilized in an unspecified secret project. Since they were never a ctually registered at Mau- thausen, the Hollerith Department suggested their n ames just be sent to Zentral Institut as \"departures.\" 49 Zentral Institut's elaborate Hollerith banks at Blo ck F, 129 Friedrich- strasse were expensive Dehomag systems. But the SS could more than justify the cost because slave labor was sold by the SS Eco nomics Administration and managed as a profit center. Enterprises as larg e as the heavy industries of I.G. Farben, as delicate as Hotel Glasstuben, an d as small as a local busi- ness, routinely contracted for slave labor with Dep artment DII, which gov- erned all slave labor assignments. For instance, in late July 1942, farmer Adam Bar of Wurzelbrunn, short on farmhands for his beet fields, applied to DII for two farm slaves from Flossenburg. 50 The SS Economics Administration, which had total op erational control of all camps, could supply exactly the skilled work ers required and transfer people from camp to camp, and factory to factory, b y setting the dials of their Hollerith systems that had stored the details of al l inmate cards. Two im- portant inmate cards were utilized. The Personal In mate Card was used for on-site camp registration and stayed with the indiv idual in the field. DII's centralized version was simply called \"Inmate Card. \" Every Inmate Card held in DII's Central Inmate File fisted the prisoner's profession in a field to be punched into column 10 of the IBM card. For example , Spanish inmate 30543 was listed as a lumberman. That qualified 305 43 to be assigned by the Neuengamme concentration camp as a \"helper\" in any slave enterprise. Occupational details for column 10 were provided by the top line of the reverse side of the Personal Inmate Card. 51 Maschinelles Berichtwesen, the Reich's central punc h card agency, had helped develop the slave labor punch card in conjun ction with Dehomag engineers. These cards listed inmates by nationalit y and trade.

Charges for DII's workers could be easily tabulated on Dehomag's well- established hourly wage cards, thereby generating i nstant slave billings. A typical monthly charge to Messerschmitt airplane wo rks for Flossenburg slaves was the one itemized on DII's invoice #FLO 6 80, which was issued December 1, 1944: • 50,778 full-time skilled slaves at RM 5 per day • 5,157 part-time skilled slaves at RM 2.50 per day • 53,071 full-time helpers at RM 3 daily • 5,600 part-time helpers at just RM 1.50 daily Messerschmitt's total invoice for the month of Nove mber 1944 was RM 434,395.50. Although Messerschmitt employed 114,606 Flossenbiirg slaves in November 1942, once the month closed on November 30 , DII was able to gen- erate an itemized invoice within twenty-four hours. Prompt payment was requested. 53 Slave revenues for all camps totaled RM 13.2 millio n for 1942. This program of working inmates to death had a name. The Reich called it \"exter- mination by labor.\" Atop the ironwork entrances of many slave camps was an incomprehensible motto: Arbeit Macht Frei—\"Work wil l set you free.\" 54 EVERY HELL has its hierarchy. Each Hollerith code carried cons equences. In the concentration camps, the levels of inhumanity, pain, and torture were not the happenstance of incarceration as much as a dest iny assured by Hollerith coding. Many unfortunate groups were shipped to the camps. But the Jews, coded as they were, were singled out for special cr uelties that forced them to either live a more tortured life or die a more hein ous death. It was impossible to shirk one's Hollerith code. Mo st camps classed prisoners into sixteen categories: Political Prisoner 1 Communist Spaniard 6 Bible Researcher 2 Foreign Civilian Worker 7 Homosexual 3 Jew 8 Dishonorable Military Discharge 4 Asocial 9 Clergy 5 Habitual Criminal 10"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"Major Felons 11 Covert Prisoner 14 Gypsy 12 Hard Labor Detainee 15 Prisoner of War 13 Diplomatic Consul 16. 55 On arrival, all prisoners would register and receiv e their five-digit in- mate number, as well as a striped uniform sewn with a color-coded triangu- lar chest patch. The patch identified the man at a distance to both guards and more privileged prisoners. Generally, but not a lways, political criminals wore red patches. Homosexuals wore pink. Serious cr iminals wore green. Jews, coded 8, were forced to wear two triangular p atches forming the six- pointed Star of David. Various additional markings and colors on the yellow star connoted either \"race polluter\" or political J ew. 56 As horrific as camps were for all, Jews coded by nu mber experienced an additional nightmare of unspeakable dimension. B ecause Jews were in- stantly recognizable by their patches, they could b e denounced at every turn as \"Jewish swine,\" or \"Jewish muck,\" with the atten dant physical abuse. 57 One could never escape his code. Coded maltreatment also meant segregated quarters a nd more severe work conditions for Jews. In Buchenwald, for exampl e, Jews were almost al- ways confined to the so-called Little Camp, where p risoners were housed sixteen to a 12' x 12' \"shelf,\" triple-decked. Many new inmates were initiated by spending time in the Litde Camp, where they were expected to quickly lose about 40 percent of their body weight, and the n move on to other bar- racks. But Jews were not released. Emaciated Jewish prisoners who \"had been around long enough\" or who refused to be menta lly broken, were arbi- trarily condemned to death—generally an entire shel f at a time. 58 Once the murder decision had been made, all sixteen Jews in the shelf were immediately marched to a small door adjacent t o Buchenwald's incinera- tor building. The door opened inwards creating a sh ort, three-foot-long corri- dor. Jews were pushed and herded until they reached the corridor end. There, a hole dropped thirteen feet down a concrete shaft and into the Strangling Room. A camp worker recalled, \"As they hit the floo r they were garroted ... by big SS guards and hung on hooks along the side wall , about 6 1/2 feet above the floor... any who were still struggling were stu nned with a wooden mallet ... An electric elevator ... ran [the corpses] up t o the incinerator room.\" 59 In another camp, Jews were once singled out on Hanu kkah, the Jewish festival of fights that features the lighting of sm all candles. Guards ordered Jews to gather round. Eight were selected and strun g upside down. The"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"Jews were then forced to douse the hanging men with oil, and ignite them one by one. As the immolating Jews shrieked in pain , the unfortunate audi- ence was compelled to joyously sing t h e Christinas carol \"Silent Night.\" 60 For the smallest of infractions, including not stan ding completely erect or speaking out of line, Jews were regularly flogge d in an official method prescribed by Berlin administrators. For example, J ews were tied to a board for twenty-five lashes on the buttocks delivered by exuberant guards who often jumped into the air to increase momentum. If the Jew screamed out, the beating was increased ten more strokes. Because they were Jews—and only because they were Jews—if the guard was in the mood he could increase the number to sixty lashes. 61 Many random cruelties such as floggings, kicking, t esticle beatings, and other sadistic acts were inflicted against Jews, es pecially by those of higher rank among the prisoners, such as Poles or German c riminals. Other prison- ers often attempted to curry favor with their guard s by brutalizing Jews. Guards often demanded it as sport. Jews, no matter how broken or bloody, could not be admitted to the infirmary at some camp s; one inmate recalls Jews were classed as \"well or dead.\" 62 Hollerith codes afflicted not just Jews, but others at the bottom of the hierarchy of camp victims. For example, Jehovah's W itnesses were coded 2. Known as \"Bible Researchers,\" Jehovah's Witnesses w ere singled out for their abstinent refusal to register for the German draft and their Christian rejection of anti-Semitism. They were rewarded with a greater level of mal- treatment than almost any prisoner other than a Jew coded 8. To relieve their daily agony of beatings and camp killings, Jehovah' s Witnesses needed only to sign a declaration denouncing their church and s ubmit to the military draft. This they steadfastly declined to do. For th eir courage and conscience, Jehovah's Witnesses were tortured and slaughtered. 63 Each special incarcerated group bore the horrors in flicted by their codes. Homosexuals coded 3 and assigned pink triang les were singled out for bestial treatment. Even traditional Germans who had been classed as \"work-shy\" or \"asocial,\" that is, people who simply did not fit the Nazi mold, found themselves the targets of specially prescribe d mistreatment in ways that other coded prisoners were not. The bottom of the Personal Inmate Card logged prescribed tortures in a section headed Strafen im Lager, \"Pun- ishment Administered in Camp.\" In addition to daily random brutalities, officially prescribed punishment was often meted ou t on specific orders issued by the SS Economics Administration in Berlin .

Zentral Institut Hollerith Transfer Lists a lways included it. Even in death, Nazi victims were coded. Four main death cod es were punched into Zentral Institut Hollerith cards: Death by natural causes C-3 Execution D-4 Suicide E-5 SB Special Treatment F-6 65 Most death reports were coded C-3, even when people were openly murdered. But the fourth death code was in fact a s ecret one. F-6 stood for SB, Sonderbehandlung or \"Special Treatment.\" Any pu nishment coded F-6 was in fact an order for extermination, either by g as chamber or bullet. 66 The multitude of columns and codes punched into Hol lerith and sorted for instant results was an expensive, never-ending enterprise designed to implement Hitler's evolving solutions to what was c alled the Jewish problem. From Germany's first identifying census in 1933, to its sweeping occupa- tional and social expulsions, to a net of ancestral tracings, to the Nuremberg definitions of 1935, to the confiscations, and fina lly to the ghettoizations, it was the codes that branded the individual and seale d his destiny. Each code was a brick in an inescapable wall of data. Trapped by their code, Jews could only helplessly wait to be sorted for Germany's nex t persecution. The system Germany created in its own midst, it also exported by conquest or subver- sion. As the war enveloped all Europe, Jews across the Continent found themselves numbered and sorted to one degree or ano ther. By early 1942, a change had occurred. Nazi Germany no longer killed just Jewish people. It killed Jewish populations. T his was the data-driven denouement of Hitler's war against the Jews. Hollerith codes, compilations, and rapid sorts had enabled the Nazi Reich to make an unprecedented leap from individual destruction to some- thing on a much larger scale. No longer were such v ague notions as \"destruc- tion\" and \"elimination\" bandied ambiguously in spee ches and decrees. From early 1942, the prophetic new Nazi word openly pron ounced in newspapers was extermination. The context, as spoken in Europe and widely reported in the media, always connoted but one objective: mass killing. Systematic co- ordinated extermination would yield an unimaginable new solution to the"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"Jewish problem in Europe. This ultimate phase was k nown as Endlosung. In German, the term conveyed a s i n g u l a r meaning: \"'The Final Solution.\" 67 SEVERAL FORCES were in play on January 1, 1942, as Hitler set the Final So- lution in motion. First, the Reich was well along in implementing its policy of pauperiz- ing and enslaving European Jewry. In this campaign, the goal of emigration had become essentially curtailed or nonexistent, re placed by a program of \"extermination by labor,\" organized ghetto starvati on, and pit massacres. Still many Jews were hearty enough, or lucky enough, to s urvive the rigors of inhumane Nazi-style \"forced labor,\" or escape into the forests. Second, the long-standing goal of the Nazi movement , that is, the com- plete destruction of the Jewish people, was now cry stallizing. For years, the debate within Nazi circles had taken many forms, in cluding physical extermi- nation. Hitler had publicly prophesied in 1939 that if the world again returned to war, he would utterly destroy the Jewis h people. In Hitler's view, the conflict in Europe became a \"World War\" when Am erica entered after Pearl Harbor was bombed in December 1941. Der Fuhre r was now deter- mined to unleash a long contemplated campaign of sy stematic, automated genocide, thus once and for all ridding the world o f Jews. 68 Just weeks after America entered the war with Germa ny, the two related campaigns accelerated: extermination by lab or, and the new drive to exterminate all Jews by the most expedient method p ossible. On January 20, 1942, a top-secret conference of Hitler's key lieut enants was held in a Berlin suburb at the elegant terraced villa located at Am Grossen Wannsee 56-58. The purpose: coordinate the efficient murder of mil lions of Jews. The secret gathering was limited to senior Nazi leadership, in cluding Reinhard Hey- drich, the head of Security Police, and Gestapo Chi ef Heinrich Muller. Yet the conferees in many ways relied upon three key lo wer-level experts. One was Roderich Plate, a racial census expert. The sec ond was Richard Korherr, Himmler's handpicked statistical overlord. The thir d was Adolf Eichmann. Plate was Korherr's assistant and both were establi shed Hollerith experts. 69 During the meeting, Heydrich presented a long list of Jewish popula- tions, broken down by territory and country. Eichma nn provided the list based on compilations by Korherr and Plate. Working with a coterie of current and former Dehomag experts, they developed the statistics. The con- clave at Wannsee resulted in a Protocol, which outl ined the massive demo-"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"gr a phi c an d ge o gra phi c lo gis tica l c hallenge. The pr inted Protocol's center- piece was, in fact, the s t a t i s t i c a l report on the m ission ahead. 70 Germany: 131,800; Ostmark region: 43,700; Eastern t erritories: 420,000; Occupied Poland: 2,284,000; Bialystok: 400,000; Boh emia and Moravia: 74,200; Latvia: 3,500; Lithuania: 34,000; Belgium: 43,000; Denmark: 5,600; Occupied France: 165,000; Unoccupied France: 700,00 0; Greece: 69,600; Netherlands: 160,800; Norway: 1,300. . . . The long enumeration of popu- lation statistics went on, country after country, a nd even included England and Ireland. 71 The Protocol's grand total was 11 million including the British Isles and a broad estimate of 5 million for Russia. The confe rence was told, \"the num- ber of Jews given here for foreign countries includ es, however, only those Jews who still adhere to the Jewish faith, since so me countries still do not have a definition of the term 'Jew' according to ra cial principles.\" 72 Korherr's estimates for the conference were profoun dly inflated. Cer- tainly, Reich experts had been able to create preci se population tables for Greater Germany and most of the occupied territorie s. But, at the time, the Nazis simply lacked accurate information about many other countries, espe- cially Russia. Nonetheless, for the Nazi leadership assembled, the numbers, howsoever inaccurate, presented the oudine of the g enocidal task they faced. It was massive and unprecedented. A two-tiered genocide was emphasized: extermination by labor and expedient mass murder. \"In the course of the final solution the Jews are to be allocated for appropriate labor in the East,\" th e Protocol recorded. \"Able- bodied Jews, separated according to sex, will be ta ken in large work columns to these areas for work on roads, in the course of which action, doubdess, a large portion will be eliminated by natural causes. The possible final remnant will, since it will undoubtedly consist of the most resistant portion, have to be treated accordingly, because it is the product o f natural selection and would, if released, act as the seed of a new Jewish revival. 73 \"In the course of the practical execution of the Fi nal Solution, Europe will be combed through from west to east. . . . The evacuated Jews will first be sent, group by group, to so-called transit ghett os, from which they will be transported to the East.\" Jews in Poland were speci fied as \"epidemic carriers\" and \"of approximately 2.5 million Jews, the majorit y is unfit for work.\" 74 In the parlance of Wannsee, those \"unfit for work\" wer e to be put to death as soon as possible. As daunting as the deportation campaign would be, t he Nazis insisted it"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"be subordinated to their own Nuremberg racial theor ies. A complicated list of mandatory or potential exceptions was l a i d out. For example, \"persons of mixed blood of the f i r s t degree married to persons of German blood\" would be \"treated essentially as Germans.\" 75 The Wannsee Conference and its Protocol were consid ered by many to be the next major step in the Final Solution of the Jewish problem in Europe. Although most of the bizarre formulaic exce ptions would be eventu- ally discarded, and although the true number of Jew s existing in Europe was vasdy overstated in the meeting, this much was appa rent: the Final Solution would require an enormous amount of statistical inf ormation. Korherr, assisted by Plate, was ready to provide it. Plate was an experienced Hollerith expert. After a stint as administra- tive assistant with the Reich Statistical Office, h e joined the Race Political Office of the NSDAP in 1935. Soon thereafter, he as sisted noted raceologist Friedrich Burgdorfer in compiling an estimate of al l racial Jews in Germany. Later, he helped produce a second estimate, this on e of World Jewry. In suc- ceeding years, Plate functioned as the Reich Statis tical Office's liaison to Eichmann's Referat II 112, also known as the Jewish Division. Plate was described by colleagues as an expert \"in all import ant questions regarding the census, religious and race statistics, special counts of Jews, special counts of foreigners, and minority statistics.\" Plate, a c ivilian when Wannsee con- vened, was required to sign an oath of secrecy thre e days before the confer- ence and was drafted into the military five days la ter. 76 Korherr was the most important statistics man in th e Nazi hierarchy. Irritable, defensive, and almost possessive about h is Hollerith machines, Korherr had been developing race-oriented punch car d programs for years. Always a rabid raceologist and statistical adventur er, his early writings denounced the \"niggerization\" of France and urged t he defense of the \"white race.\" 77 His career included work with the Reich Statistical Office, and later, service as the Director of Population Politics and Statistics for Deputy Fuhrer Hess. But Korherr did not become the undisputed syn dic of all Nazi statistics until December 9, 1940. On that day, Himmler issued and personally signed two explicit orders. The first appointed Korherr In spector of Statistics for the SS as well as for the Chief of the German Police. T he second outlined Korherr's broad portfolio. By any reading, it was a n extraordinary entitle- ment and cachet for one who might be viewed as a me re statistical techni- cian. But Korherr was more than just a number crunc her. 78 He would become the keeper of the state's most incriminating genocidal secrets."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"\"The Inspector reports directly to me and receives his instructions from me personally,\" ordered SS Chief Himmler in Korherr 's bona fides. \"The Inspector is solely responsible for the totality of statistics of all units and offices in my area. The work of the Inspector is to be supported in every way possible in light of the necessity and significance [of] . . . practical statistics. . . . The Inspector is the sole point of contact be tween the Reich and provin- cial and Party statistics.\" 79 Korherr was more than willing to jealously guard hi s domain of Holle- rith expertise, even if it meant tangling with Nazi dom's top generals. For example, one general at the Wannsee Conference was Gruppenfuhrer Otto Hofmann, the general in charge of the politically w ell-connected SS Race and Settlement Department. The Race and Settlement Offi ce was a marginal agency that functioned as a marriage-assistance bur eau for SS officers, and therefore had to wait two years to secure its own H ollerith: When it finally arrived, Gruppenfiihrer Hofmann was excited about h is new Hollerith instal- lation, and had already suggested expansive changes in statistical campaigns and the creation of new racial registration offices across Greater Germany. Kor- herr openly denigrated Hofmann's ideas as unnecessa ry and duplicative. 80 Shortly after the Wannsee Conference, Korherr wrote to a colleague, 'T would like to mention that the understandable lack of statistical expertise at the Race and Settlement Office, coupled with their urgent wish for a large statistics office with a Hollerith system and for a n SS population card file, made [recent] negotiations extraordinarily difficul t. For the statistician, the best proof of an amateur is when someone wants to b egin—and end—his statistical work with a card file . . . Since Reich sjuhrer [Himmler] appointed me the sole liaison for Reich statistics . . . I see Gruppenfiihrer Hofmann's behavior as deliberately ... undermining my positio n.\" 81 Korherr snidely added, \"The person in charge at the Reich Statistical Office was astonished at Gruppenfuhrer Hofmann's pl ans and asked: then why did Reichsjuhrer [Himmler] hire me and Dr. Plat e. We were both amused at the idea of a Hollerith survey of the entire pop ular [German] movement ... I suggested the numerical continuation of the [ existing] inventory instead of a [new] Hollerith system ... I should just float above it all.\" 82 Korherr's expertise was so valued, Himmler sided wi th him even over a prominent SS general. Eventually, Himmler issued Ko rherr an additional directive: \"in order to avoid jurisdictional confli cts and streamline work pro- cedures, you are to be given responsibility for pro cessing all statistical mat- ters for [Gruppenfiihrer Hofmann's] Race and Settle ment Office.\" 83 As Himmler's plenipotentiary for all statistical ma tters, Korherr was able"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"to coordinate the data a c tivi t i e s of numerous Reich agencies and call upon many Hollerith experts who had been either trained by Dehomag, or were employees transferred or loaned to government offic es for the war period. One example was Albert Bartels, head of the SS mach ine record agency and in charge of Waffen-SS Holleriths at Dachau. Bartel s also worked at the com- plex at 129 Friedrichstrasse. In one typical packet , Bartels sent Korherr \"work progress forms and punch cards used in my office. I ask you . . . for the nec- essary evaluations.\" Bartels' assistant was Busch, the former Hollerith dealer who ran the Waffen-SS machines at the Storkow camp. Herbert Blaettel, a veteran of Dehomag's training department, worked at Dachau's Hollerith Department. Dehomag's Munich dealer, Herr Asmis, so ld the Nazi Party office its original leases; he only left the subsid iary in August 1944 to work with government projects. The Maschinelles Berichtw esen was the clearing- house for all punch card technology, and their reso urces could be continu- ously tapped. 84 In January 1943, Korherr was required to provide Hi mmler with a status report on the Final Solution. To do so, Korh err worked frantically to determine exactly how many Jews had been killed, co untry by country. He demanded a stream of data from all the ghettos and other territories where Eichmann had been working. Eichmann remembered that he provided Korherr \"all our top-secret stuff. That was the ord er. All the shipments [of Jews] insofar as they had been reported to us.\" Eic hmann added, \"The statis- tician [Korherr] was with me, a week or maybe two, in my office, day after day, making his inquiries, he sent telegrams etc. a ll over the place.\" 85 Korherr eventually produced a sixteen-page draft re port, but was re- quired to condense the tabulated data to just seven pages so Hitler could review it. When Korherr completed the summary, the perfectionist in him was still frustrated. \"Despite the expended sweat, an accurate number for this time period cannot be given,\" he asserted, but he a ssured the report none- theless did offer \"useful clues.\" Korherr's progres s report was submitted to Hitler on March 23, 1943. 86 This time, the numbers were precise, enumerating Je wish communities throughout Europe, by ghetto and territory. The wor d \"evacuation\" was used to designate gassing in killing centers such as Tre blinka and Sobibor. To eastern Russia: 1,449,692 Jews; to camps in occupie d Poland: 1,274,166; through camps in the Warthe region: 145,301. Occupi ed France: 41,911; Netherlands: 38,571; Belgium: 16,886; Norway: 532; Slovakia: 56,691; Croa- tia: 4,927. Total evacuations including Special Tre atment: 1,873,519. The total was written as more than 2.5 million to date. 87 "},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"Himmler was so pleased with the report and Korherr' s subsequent per- formance, he eventually appointed the statistician to a specially created agency known as the Statistical Scientific Institut e of the Reichsfuhrer SS. It, too, was located at Block F, 129 Friedrichstrasse. Korherr's new office now had the most up-to-the-minute access to all concent ration camp information streaming into the Zentral Institut. By early 1944, Korherr was able to report to Eichmann a total of 5 million Jews eliminated by \"natural decrease, con- centration camp inmates, ghetto inmates, and those who were [simply] put to death.\" 88 The offices at Block F, 129 Friedrichstrasse, undou btedly processed more information than any other single office in Ge rmany about the mass murder of Europe's Jews. More than a statistical bu reau, by its very nature, the Hollerith complex at Friedrichstrasse helped Hi tler, Himmler, Heydrich, and Eichmann prioritize, schedule, and manage the s eemingly impossible logistics of genocide across dozens of cities in mo re than twenty countries and territories. It was not just people who were co unted and marshaled for deportation. Boxcars, locomotives, and intricate tr ain timetables were sched- uled across battle-scarred borders—all while a war was being fought on two fronts. The technology had enabled Nazi Germany to orchestrate the death of millions without skipping a note. Amidst the whirlwind of the Final Solution, the Thi rd Reich's transition from the blind persecution of a general population to the destruction of indi- viduals had come full circle. In genocide, the Jews lost their identity. They had been reduced to mere nameless data bits. Now ea ch murdered Jew no longer even represented an individual death. Now ev ery corpse comprised a mere component in a far larger statistical set addi ng up to total annihilation. When Jews were worked to death, they were tracked w ith Inmate Cards, Hollerith Transfer Lists, punch cards, and e ndless sorters. It was expensive, but in the Nazi view, a necessary cost a llowing the Reich to track and regiment a Jew's every move. When enslaved Jews in work camps were about to be killed, their cards were taken—they no longer needed one. 89 When ghettoized Jews were selected for deportation, and dispatched by Hollerith-scheduled trains to killing stations i n Poland, they received no cards. Their names were not printed on any Hollerit h Transfer List. When they arrived at the mass murder centers in Treblink a, Sobibor, Belzec, or any of the others sites reserved for eradication, a doctor briefly glanced at victims hurriedly filing past. A wave to the left m eant reporting to the camp entrance for the prospect of laboring for a few day s, perhaps a month. But most were never registered in any Arbeitseinsatz. 90 They had oudived the"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"potential for usefulness. They were expeditiously d irected to their final des- tiny: the showers. The synchrony was exquisite. From the moment a Jew stepped onto the train platform in the ghetto, to the moment he was violently thrashed out of the boxcar at the final stop and led to his deat h, there were never any delays. Precision timing and scheduling was indispe nsable to the process. No longer worth the expense of a bullet, victims were gassed in large groups. At Auschwitz—2,000 at a time. Prussic acid pellets, Zy klon B, were dropped into water buckets to accomplish the mass asphyxiation. The screaming, clanging on the steel doors, and shrieks of ancient Jewish i ncantation, Sh'ma Yisra'el, stopped after fifteen minutes. Generally within an hour of stepping off the train, the Jews in a transport were successfully ex terminated. 91 Nor were any death records transmitted. It was enou gh to inform Zen- tral Institut that the people had boarded a train. Hence, the machines only tabulated the evacuations. No more was necessary. F rom these trains, there was no escape, no need for tracking, no further uti lity, and no further cost would be expended. At this point, the Jews were no longer worth a bullet, nor the price of a single punch card. 92 Only at the moment of extermination did the Jews of Europe finally break free from Hitler's Holleriths. G ERMANY HAD forced Jews to help organize their own annihilation by es- tablishing Judenrate, that is, Jewish councils. The se councils were generally comprised not of communal leaders, but of arbitrari ly selected Jewish per- sonalities, frequendy engineers. Engineers were cho sen because they could relate to the mechanics of the numerical process un derway. Judenrat leaders Ephraim Barash of Bialystok and Adam Czerniakow of Warsaw, for example, were both engineers. Eichmann considered himself an engineer by trade. 93 Those council members who did not cooperate, or who even hesitated, were quickly murdered—often on the spot. Amid accus ations of collabora- tion that would reverberate forever, the Judenrate were faced with the impos- sible choice of functioning—literally at gunpoint—a s best they could, as long as they could. With their dismal ghetto communities starving, and rotting corpses piled high in the streets for lack of mortu ary facilities, the councils hoped to somehow survive the brutalities of ghetto life, hour to hour. 94 Sto- ries about gas chambers at the end of the railway t rack were circulating. So by their cooperation with constant census and regis tration projects, as well as"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"organized evacuation and, in many instances, the v irtual sell selection of names to fill the trains, the enormity of Nazi inte nt took shape. Quickly it became apparent to the men of the Judenr ate that they were not conducting census and other statistical duties for the purposes of sur- vival under a brutish occupation, or evacuation to less crowded settlements - but for organized extermination. In essence, thes e men were metering their own deaths in cadence to the overall Nazi tim etable. Some were able to withstand the awesome personal nightmare, and funct ioned as demanded until the end. However, many reached a point of per sonal defiance. When that point came, their sole means of briefly slowin g down the Nazi machine was suicide or suicidal refusal. Arye Marder, head of Grodno ghetto's statistical de partment, submitted his resignation in November 1942, when German plans became inescapable. His name was placed on the next transport. He commi tted suicide. So his family was sent in his place. 95 Moshe Kramarz refused to sign a document claiming t he Minsk ghetto was \"deporting\" its Jews by choice. He tore the doc ument into little pieces in front of people and loudly warned all within earsho t that whether called \"resettlement\" or \"evacuation,\" the process was rea lly extermination. Gestapo officers immediately pummeled him and his colleague s, dragged the group away, and executed them all. 96 In Lukow ghetto, Judenrat member David Liberman col lected dona- tions from residents thinking it was a ransom to sa ve lives. When he learned the money would only be used to pay their own freig ht to the Treblinka death camp, he shouted at a German supervisor, \"Her e is your payment for our trip, you bloody tyrant!\" He tore the bills int o bits and slapped the Ger- man's face. Ukrainian guards killed Liberman where he stood. 97 The Bereza Kartuska ghetto Judenrat was ordered to produce a list of Jews to assemble at the marketplace on October 15, 1942, \"for work in Rus- sia.\" The men of the council understood the people would be traveling to their doom. Unwilling to issue the lists, the counc il members assembled and collectively hanged themselves in the council offic es. Two physicians and their families joined the protest by committing sui cide as well. 98 At Pruzana ghetto, forty-one members of the Judenra t staged a Masada action. Rather than submit to a Nazi-imposed death, they and their families gathered. Poison was distributed. The children swal lowed first. Then the women. Finally the men. One man held back to make s ure all had died. Then he gulped his. But the impoverished Judenrat simply did not have enough"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"poison to formulate lethal doses. Some people emerg ed from mere drowsi- ness. So one man closed the chimney flu, scaled the windows, and turned on the oven. When the bodies were found the next morni ng, all but one was revived, and eventually deported to the camps.\" Adam Czemiakow, the head of Warsaw's ghetto Judenra t, the man who so tirelessly organized the census, began to see th e process as wholesale murder. One day, when the Nazis demanded he increas e the deportation lists from 6,000 to 10,000, he drew a line. Czerniakow al so ended his duties by ending his life. 100 Judenrat resistance never effectively delayed any G erman action in the ghettos. With scores of Jews dying of starvation or disease each week, a col- lection of suicides and executions simply became pa rt of the hellscape. But their sacrifice made one thing clear. Even though t hey never comprehended the technologic intricacies of the process underway , and although most had never seen a punch card, they did sense that all th e registrations and endless lists added up to a single odious destiny. They fou ght back with their only remaining weapon: the power to control their own ex tinction."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"XIV THE S P O I L S OF GENOCIDE, I NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY IBM MACHINES clattered in which ghetto zone, train depo t, or concentration camp.

Machines were often moved—with or without IBM's knowledge—from th e officially listed commercial or governmental client to a deadl y Nazi installa- tion in another country, and then eventually transf erred back again. 1 Most importantly, it did not matter whether IBM did or did not know exacdy which machine was used at which dea th camp. All that mattered was that the money would be waiti ng—once the smoke cleared. In fact, a pattern emerged throughout war-ravaged E urope. Be- fore America entered the war, IBM NY and its subsid iaries worked directly with Germany or Italy, or its occupying fo rces. As part of the strategic alliance, it also worked with German symp athizers and allies in countries such as Romania, Yugoslavia, and Hunga ry. 2 Watson would even order new subsidiaries established in co nquered terri- tories in cadence with Nazi invasions. 3 Even after America declared war, IBM offices worldwide would openly transact wi th these clients, or with other subsidiaries, until the moment Genera l Ruling 11 was triggered for that particular territory.

But, in truth, e x e c u t i v e s in New York could still monitor events and exercise authority in Eur ope through neutral country subsidiaries. These overseas units always remained under the parent company's control. Moreover, special bureaucratic exemptions were regularly sought by IBM NY, or its subsidiaries, to continue or exp and business dealings throughout occupied Europe. 5 Official American demands that business be curtailed were often ignored. 6 Once the United States entered the war, Axis custod ians would be appointed as titular directors of subsidiaries in o ccupied territory. But these enemy custodians never looted the IBM divisions. Ra ther, they zealously protected the assets, extended productivity, and in creased profits. Existing IBM executives were kept in place as day-to-day man agers and, in some instances, even appointed deputy enemy custodians. In France, for example, although SS Officer Heinz Westerholt was appointed enemy custodian of CEC, he, in turn, appointed Dehomag's Oskar Hoerman n as deputy custo- dian. CEC's Roger Virgile continued as managing dir ector to keep the com- pany profitable and productive. In Belgium, Nazi cu stodian H. Garbrecht remained aloof, allowing IBM managers Louis Bosman and G. Walter Gal- land to remain in place and virtually in command. I n Germany, Dehomag's board of directors was superseded by custodian Herm ann Fellinger. Fellinger replaced Heidinger, and then insisted tha t Rottke, Hummel, and all the other managers in Dehomag's twenty offices cont inue producing record profits. 7 Whether overseen by Nazi executives or Watson's ow n, IBM Europe thrived. In the later war years, as the Allies moved across the western and east- ern fronts, various liberated or about-to-be libera ted territories emerged as exempt from prohibited trading under General Ruling 11. Sometimes the applicable regulations changed on an almost daily b asis. IBM NY or IBM Geneva would tenaciously check with American author ities for permission to communicate or transact with previously proscribed subsidiaries. When direct contact was not possible, American legations passed the messages as a courtesy. 8 During IBM's continuing wartime commerce, the world was always aware that the machinery of Nazi occupation was bei ng wielded to extermi- nate as many Jews as possible as quickly as possibl e. After endless newspaper and newsreel reports, and once the Allies confirmed their own intelligence revelations in summer 1942, the conclusion became i nescapable: Germany's"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"goal was nothing short of complete physical extermi nation of all European Jewry. On December 17, 1942, the Allies finally dec lared there would be \"war crime\" trials and punishment. The Allies warne d that all who cooper- ated with Hitler's genocide would be held responsib le before the bar of international justice. In Parliament, members rose in awed silence as one MP rang out, \"There are many today who . . . but for t he grace of God . . . might have been in those ghettos, those concentration cam ps, those slaughter- houses.\" The Allies' joint declaration of war crime s for genocide was broad- cast and published as the top news in more than twe nty-three languages the world over. 9 A New York Times article was headlined \"Allies Desc ribe Outrages on Jews,\" and sub-headlined \"Extermination Is Feared.\" It led: \"What is happen- ing to the 5,000,000 Jews of German-held Europe, al l of whom face extermi- nation.\" The Allied report emphasized calculated st arvation, group gassing, mass shooting, ghetto street scenes \"beyond imagina tion,\" and intense deportation campaigns by railroad. 10 IBM's business was never about Nazism. It was never about anti- Semitism. It was always about the money. Before eve n one Jew was encased in a hard-coded Hollerith identity, it was only the money that mattered. And the money did accrue. Millions in blocked bank accounts scattered across Europe were wait- ing for IBM, as well as its newly acquired real est ate, numerous Hitler-era factories and presses, and thousands of Hollerith m achines. Much of the money and plant expansion was funded by a fundament ally bankrupt Third Reich, which financed its rapacious operations by s lave labor, massive plun- der, and cost-effective genocide. Where did Hitler' s Germany get the money to pay for all the services, cards, and leases? Naz i gold and currency was fungible—whether carted away from banks in Prague o r pried from the teeth of Jewish carcasses at Treblinka. The Reich could a fford the best. And it pur- chased the best with the assets it stole. Managing overseas branches and conducting commerce within the bro- ken fines of changing wartime regulations was itsel f an intensive effort. Each IBM subsidiary in Europe spawned its own epic colle ction of bureaucratic correspondence, spanning months and even years. Lif e and death dramas became daily realities in Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Italy, and elsewhere as IBM employees and Hollerith technology intersected with the victors and vanquished of Nazi Europe.

R OMANIA ' S ANTI - JEWISH campaign was in full force by fall 1940. Germany had already inspired a murderously anti-Semitic reg ime in Bucharest. Ro- manian strong man Marshal Ion Antonescu's Fascist r egime had replicated Reich anti-Semitic laws of professional ousters and property confiscation. Rapidly in 1940, Romania pauperized thousands of Je ws in a highly publi- cized campaign. Soon forced Jewish labor decrees an d sporadic pogroms across Romania were breeding the usual headlines. 11 For example, in January 1941, squads of vicious Iro n Guard militants rampaged through Bucharest brutally massacring scor es of Jewish residents, Some 120 Jews were beaten, mercilessly bullwhipped and bludgeoned with metal rods. Some were made to drink from bloody bas ins. At the local slaughterhouse, several Jews were fiendishly dismem bered. 12 Carnage in Bucharest and in other areas was followe d by waves of offi- cial banishment for many to various regions and int ernment in camps. More than 100,000 Jews were thought to have been brutall y murdered in the riparian provinces during summer 1941. Yet Eichmann and other Nazis at times tried to restrain their Romanian allies becau se the Reich believed the random acts of violence were \"planless and prematur e.\" 13 The Germans favored a more orderly, comprehensive, and scientif ic approach that would systematically annihilate all of Romanian Jewry. Population estimates in Romania were wildly exagger ated. The previous census, held in 1930, counted 756,930 individuals w ho routinely identified themselves as Jewish. The scheduled 1940 census lac ked funding and was delayed. But by spring 1941, German experts estimat ed that as many as half of Romania's Jewish citizens had already been murde red, deported, or had fled as refugees. 14 Nonetheless, hysterical speculation in the Romanian press suggested as many as 2 million Jews remained within the country. The speculation was based on a misreading of the prior census. The 1930 summaries reported that of the 756,930 practicing Jews, 728,000 consid ered themselves \"ethnic Jews\" even if not religious, and 519,000 primarily spoke Yiddish. Wrongly, those three numbers were added together by some Rom anians to create a false total of 2 million. Only a proper, up-to-date census could answer what Nazi raceologists called \"the Jewish question\" in R omania. 15 "},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"Eventually, the new census was scheduled for April 1941. This would be no ordinary household count, but rather a compre hensive inventory of every individual, enterprise, farmland, animal, bui lding, profession, and asset in Romania. The counting itself would span ten days . German statisticians and IBM would assist in every way. Friedrich Burgdo rfer, President of the Bavarian Statistical Office, was invited to attend as an official observer, accompanied by Dehomag expert Ludwig Hummer. 16 W. C. Lier confirmed in a letter to Chauncey in New York, \"As regards the Census . . . neither we nor the Dehomag have be en able to obtain any precise information as regards the specifications o f the machines which are needed in Bucharest. I agreed, exceptionally, to Mr . Hummer going to Bucharest together with a representative of the Ger man Statistical Office in order to analyze the whole situation. The commercia l side of these two sub- jects has been dealt with direct with Mr. Schotte a nd Mr. Milner.\" 17 The Romanian business was not in Dehomag's portfoli o. It was an en- terprise of IBM NY. \"Watson had been preparing for the Romanian census for years. \"During 1940,\" J. C. Milner wrote Headquarte rs in 1938, \"the census will be taken in several countries, and we expect a number of orders.\" Milner hoped Endicott could develop a special IBM census t abulator in time. 18 The population segment of Romania's sweeping ten-da y count was scheduled for April 6, 1941. Article 2 of the censu s decree required a special Jewish census on April 11 and 12. The entire nation mobilized. Posters were prominently displayed in post offices, hotels, and public buildings. Radio programs, editorials, and presidential speeches enc ouraged everyone to cooperate. For accuracy's sake, volunteers were shu nned in favor of 29,000 paid census takers, each responsible for about 120 households. The women hired to punch the Hollerith cards were mainly high school graduates, which in itself was thought to increase the processing ac curacy. One thousand inspectors would oversee the overall endeavor. Even Burgdorfer admitted in a journal article that Romania's Central Statistica l Institute was \"unusually well-equipped.\" 19 Questions designed to pinpoint so-called \"race Jews \" were included in both the Jewish and general census questionnaires. The religion question not only asked for an individual's current faith, b ut also his religion at birth; the same information was solicited about the person 's father and mother. Under the ethnicity and mother tongue categories, s imilar questions were posed for both the individual and again for his par ents. Ethnicity questions were also asked in the agricultural census and job census. Even the commer- cial ownership survey solicited responses from busi nessmen about their Jew-"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"ish partners and employees. The mass of overlapping data would enable IBM tabulators to triangulate on the intended target: a nyone of Jewish ancestry- even if the person were unaware of it. 20 Specially trained enumerators worked one-on-one to evoke true ethnic responses from the population. One report indicated that when a Gypsy declined to admit his ethnicity, the suspicious cen sus taker finally said, \"Now, write: Gypsy.\" 21 Romania's census was intended to identify all the n ation's Jews, even if they were refugees or interned in concentration cam ps. So IBM's punch card was designed to record such designations as \"tempor arily absent\" for refugees and \"concentrated\" (that is, located in a concentration camp). Sum- ming up in a journal article, Burgdorfer praised th e census as \"an extraordi- narily extensive (maybe too vast) program of regist ration . . . the Jewish question is treated in great detail.\" 22 Because the Romanian census involved not just indiv iduals, but live- stock, property, professions, businesses, and virtu ally every other aspect of Romanian life, more IBM machines would be needed. I n fall 1941, shortly after Chauncey left Germany at the height of Dehoma g's revolt, Lier arrived in Berlin to represent IBM NY's interest. He wanted to make sure that Rottke and Hummel could be relied upon to carry out IBM pr ojects elsewhere in Europe. Previously, when Chauncey had inquired whet her tabulators had been dispatched to Romania, Hummel responded with w hat might seem a lack of initiative. \"We have not furnished any to R omania,\" replied Hummel. He seemed to be waiting for direct orders, saying, \"If Geneva gives us an order for Romania, we will fill it.\" 23 For Lier, Romania was clearly a priority. \"One of t he first matters dis- cussed with them,\" Lier reported to Chauncey on Oct ober 10, 1941, \"was that of the Romanian census and the machines destin ed for this business, which are actually blocked in Poland.\" The day befo re, Lier had sent a more formal letter to Watson to allay any concerns: \"On the occasion of my visit to Berlin,\" Lier wrote, \"I also settled a few pending matters, such as the machines blocked in Poland [and] the Romanian censu s ... I am addressing separate reports to the executives concerned in New York.\" 24 Lier felt that if only he could contact the Romania n Embassy, diplomats could use their connection with Reich offices in oc cupied Poland to forward the machines through the war zone. He called IBM's best contact in Berlin, U.S. Commercial Attache, Sam Woods. 'Thanks to Mr. Woods,\" Lier reported to IBM NY, \"I obtained an interview with the Romani an Commercial Attache who immediately endeavored to obtain the freeing of approximately seven-"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"teen machines at present blocked in Poland from the Devisenstelle [Foreign Currency Office] and the German Authorities ... I h ave been given every assurance as to the satisfactory outcome of this de mand.\" Shortly thereafter, Lier did effect the transfer of Dehomag machines to IBM's Romanian subsidiary. 25 A few days before Romania entered the war on June 2 2, 1941, Marshal Antonescu demanded lists of \"all Jews, Communists a nd sympathizers in each region.\" In addition, all Jews aged sixteen to sixt y in towns between the Siret and Prut rivers were to be rounded up and immediate ly shipped to a concen- tration camp on already scheduled trains. It was al l to be done in forty-eight hours. Half the eastern city of Iasi's 100,000 popu lation was Jewish. Identify- ing the victims in a lightning operation could have been an impossibility. But Antonescu's Second Section intelligence unit, which monitored ethnic groups, relied on three statistical offices, includ ing one in Iasi. The Romani- ans generated the names and addresses. An intellige nce officer recalled that the Second Section was crucial \"in paving the groun dwork for the Iasi pogrom [in that] Junius Lecca, SSI station chief [o f Iasi] had played a major role by supplying intelligence concerning Jewish re sidences and centers.\" 26 Thousands of Iasi Jews were dragged from their home s, many still in their sleeping clothes. For several days, German an d Romanian policemen and soldiers, as well as wild citizen mobs, perpetr ated unspeakable violence on the identified. Corpses began piling onto the st reet as Jews were merci- lessly clubbed to death with metal bars, rifles, an d rocks, and then ceremoni- ously spat upon. Infants were not spared. Thousands more were loaded onto death trains where they would be viciously murdered in boxcars en route. As many as 13,000 painfully lost their fives. 27 In late 1941, the statistics on Jews yielded a tota l of 375,422 Jews still surviving in Romania. In January 1942, the Wannsee Conference Protocol listed the number as 342,000 including Bessarabia, but not including certain other regions. 28 A spring 1942 Jewish census showed that 300,000 Rom anian Jews were still alive. On August 31, 1942, Antonescu rev iewed not the spring data, but the late 1941 statistics. When he saw the numbe r 375,422 Jews, he wrote, \"a very large number.\" Next to Bessarabia's 6,900 Jews, he wrote, \"Impossible! My order was to have all the Jews depo rted.\" Even though the Bukovina figure of 60,708 Jews was about a year old , he scribbled in a rage, \"Impossible. Please verify. My order stated that on ly ten thousand Jews should remain in Bukovina. Please check. This is fa ntastic! Judaized cities, simply, purely Judaized.\" 29 "},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"By Septemher 1942, Eichmann had read i e d a schedule for Romanian Railroads to transport some 280,000 of those Jews t o Belzec's gas chambers. But by now, Romania's Antonescu was reluctant to co operate further. Like other Nazi surrogates in Ivistern Europe, Antonescu feared the onslaught of the Russians, and rumors circulated of a forthcomin g war crimes announce- ment. Jewish bribes—including 100 million lei to A ntonescu's personal physician—also helped. The trains did not roll. 30 On November 17, 1943, Antonescu again reviewed cens us data with his generals. \"According to the latest statistics we ha ve now in Transnistria a little over 50,000 Jews,\" said Antonescu. Adding 10,000 Je ws from the Dorohoi area and others, Antonescu tallied \"70,000 to 80,00 0.\" General Constantin Vasilu objected, \"There was some mistake. We have t alked with Colonel Rad ulescu, who has carried out a census. There are now exacdy 61,000.\" 31 By the end of the war, after a bloody series of Rom anian-German exe- cutions and deprivations, more than 270,000 Jews ha d been brutally killed or starved. Hundreds of thousands more died in bord ering regions under Romania's jurisdiction. 32 IBM's subsidiary in Bucharest was incorporated on M arch 4, 1938, as Compania Electrocontabila Watson with approximately $240,000 in equip- ment, punch cards, and leaseable machines. Quickly, the unit became profitable. The subsidiary's main clients were the Communications Ministry, census bureaus, statistical offices, and railroads. Watson's decision to incor- porate coincided with Romania embarking on an enhan ced war footing. This martial program would include massive orders of Hol lerith equipment and punch cards. IBM Europe was unable to fill all the leases requested by Bucharest, but it ramped up production to meet the need. IBM NY was kept apprised of the progress. 33 Company executives had worked with Romanian militar y committees early in the war to scrutinize each commercial inst allation in the country, identifying which could be requisitioned by the Min istry of War. These machines were to be relocated to secure sites in th e countryside when fight- ing broke out. Special arrangements with the Romani an Ministry of War exempted IBM supervisors and engineers from the dra ft to assure continuity of service. 34 A few months after Lier arranged the shipment of se venteen additional machines from Poland to Bucharest, America declared war. Shortly there- after, Romania was deemed enemy territory under Gen eral Ruling 11. But IBM needed to finalize commissions owed to the Ital ian bank in Bucharest that covered delivery guarantees.

Lier wrote, \"In the mid- dle of last year, our Romanian company contracted a large order with the Romanian census authorities for the execution of th e census of the popula- tion of Romania. Prior to giving that order to our Romanian company, the Romanian Government required a bank guarantee to be filed with the Banque Commerciale Italienne et Roumaine in Buchare st to cover the deliv- ery of the equipment foreseen by the order... May w e therefore request you to issue a license which would authorize us to cove r the amount of Lei 111,348 by remitting this amount in Swiss Francs to the Societe de Banque Suisse in Geneva.\" 35 The American legation denied Lier's request and sug gested he contact the Treasury Department in America. Lier asked IBM NY to handle the mat- ter directly with Washington. 36 As late as January 1944, Schotte in New York acknow ledged to Depart- ment of Justice investigator Harold Carter that he knew that punch cards at the Central Institute of Statistics contained infor mation on census, popula- tion trends, and \"special studies of all minority g roups in Romania.\" Schotte also confirmed that Romania's railroads maintained \"a large installation of machines\" located at the Ministry for Communication s. The railroad's Statis- tical Department alone utilized as many as 1.7 mill ion cards annually, and its Traction Department 3.34 million more. Those cards were printed on IBM's Swift Press in its busy Bucharest facility, which w as functioning at its absolute capacity of 20 million cards per year. 37 Romania was liberated from domination by Russian oc cupiers in late August 1944. On September 2, 1944, IBM Bucharest ca bled a report to IBM Geneva: \"Company in working order. Cable instructio ns for changed circum- stances. Arrange urgendy protection of property and personnel.\" A second brief report was cabled on October 5. General Rulin g 11 had not yet been lifted, so IBM could not reply. Lier, on September 18, petitioned the Ameri- can Legation in Geneva for permission to respond. I BM was in fact the first corporation to ask permission to resume normal busi ness. America's Com- mercial Attache ruled, \"Romania is still enemy terr itory under General Rul- ing Number 11. . . . Until such time as General Rul ing Number 11 is specifically revoked or amended for Romania, the In ternational Business Machines Co. may not communicate with that country without license.\" 38 Eventually, Lier's request was routed to the State Department through the American Embassy in London. \"When a response wa s finally permitted,"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"IBM, in its very first communication, answered, \"Yo ur telegram of the 12th October seems to indicate that your present situati on is normal and that you are proceeding with your work as best you can. \" 39 The company then asked for a comprehensive eleven-p oint report on all financial statements, including profit or loss, and rental revenues by cus- tomer, for the years 1942, 1943, and 1944. In addit ion, the company also wanted an immediate estimate of future prospects in war-ravaged Romania, broken down by machines that could be rented, perso nnel needed, and spare parts required. New York also wanted to know if Romania had made its quota: asking for \"points installed and uninstalled to date.\" This way, the Romanian subsidiary could take its rightful place i n IBM's Hundred Percent Club for outstanding performance. 40 Romania was liable for war reparations, including $ 20 million to pay American claims, £10 million in Britain for its cla ims, and approximately $300 million for Russian claims. 41 By late July 1945, IBM had lodged its own compensat ion claims for war damage. The total of $151,383.73 included $37,946.4 1 for damaged Hollerith machines. It also called on State Department interm ediaries to secure its bank accounts in Romania. 42 For IBM Romania, the war was over. B ULGARIA RELUCTANTLY joined the Axis bloc in March 1941. In exchange, it received German military support for its territo rial ambitions in the Balkans. The Bulgarian military occupied Thrace and Macedonia in neigh- boring Greece. But Bulgarian society—from its churc hes to its government— overwhelmingly rejected German anti-Semitism for th e nation's 48,000 well-integrated Jews. Under extreme pressure from G ermany, the country half-heartedly issued anti-Jewish legislation, but deliberately laced the pro- fessional exclusions and property confiscations wit h many exceptions, includ- ing conversion. 43 Bulgaria did everything it could to frustrate Germa n plans for Bulgarian Jewry. At one point, when German-pressured regulati ons called for Jews to wear an identifying Star of David, senior Bulgarian church officials thwarted the move. Sermonizing that no man had the right to torture Jews, the Metro- politan of Sofia arranged for all so-called baptize d Jews to be freed from the obligation. When that measure was not enough, the g overnment cut off elec- tricity to the factory producing the stars, claimin g it was a power shortage. 44 Eichmann's office wanted the Jews deported from the beginning. But"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"the Bulgarian people were so opposed to the deporta tion plans that farmers had threatened to throw t h e i r bodies across the rai lroad tracks to stop any trains. Nonetheless, by late November 1941, German Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop, in a conference with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Popov, declared it the \"unalterable decision of der Fuhrer\" that al l Jews would be removed from Europe. As an \"intermediate step,\" Bulgaria wa s instructed, the nation's 48,000 Jews would be concentrated in Poland. The me thod: deportation by train. 45 IBM's subsidiary in Sofia, formed on March 17, 1938 , was Watson Busi- ness Machines Corporation, Ltd. Its single most imp ortant customer was the Bulgarian Railroads. As with virtually all railroad s since the turn of the cen- tury, punch cards made it possible to efficiently s chedule trains, locate rolling stock, and deploy boxcars. Without Holleriths, it c ould take any European railway company up to two weeks to locate its boxca rs in peacetime. In wartime, fast deployment was even more difficult. U sing Holleriths at every major stop, train authorities could schedule within forty-eight hours. For this reason, whatever part of the war or the genocide th at ran on track and rail was vitally dependent on IBM. 46 Punch cards cost money. In spring 1942, just as the Bulgarian govern- ment had cut electricity off from the factory makin g Stars of David, the authorities also froze the railroad's payments to I BM, forcing the money into a blocked account. By spring, Watson Business Machi nes Corporation of Sofia was on the verge of bankruptcy. Unless that m oney was quickly re- leased, the company would be compelled to close its doors. Bulgarian Rail- roads would then not receive its punch cards nor an y further parts and service for its machines. 47 On May 2, 1942, the IBM manager in Sofia, Pavel A. Datsoff, contacted Lier at IBM Geneva. \"As you are informed,\" wrote Da tsoff\", \"we have to receive from the railways the rent for the current 1942 year, but until now this amount is not paid due to the newly created co nditions, and will be locked up in the National Bank. . . . As we have mone y which will be able to cover our expenses only for another four months, an d if in the meantime we do not succeed to arrange ... rent from the Railway s, we shall be left with no money for our rent, salaries and other expenses. .. . I beg you ... to open a current account through Bank Suisse for us in the I talian Bank, as it was in the past... to cover our expenses to the end of the current year. Otherwise, remaining with no money, it will be necessary to in form the personnel to look for other jobs and according [to] the law, we must notify them three months ahead.\" 48 "},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"But IBM NY could not fund its Bulgarian operations without violating General Ruling 11.

Do you think that there is any chance of obtaining a special license to pro- vide the Bulgarian company with funds . . . in order to avoid its complete bankruptcy?\" 49 The American legation rejected Lier's entreaty, exp laining that monies could be funneled into \"enemy territory through the Swiss Government only to cover the minimum subsistence requirements of Am erican citizens who are entided to receive such relief payments.\" Even still, the legation said it would transmit Lier's request on to the State Depar tment, in case Washing- ton wanted to forward the correspondence to IBM NY. 50 However, on June 22, 1942, the Geneva legation went further, sending Lier's request to Washington, and actually suggesti ng that copies of both Lier's letter and Datsoff's financial distress call be passed to IBM NY. 51 Unwilling to wait for a Treasury license, Lier in e arly July 1942 urgendy asked the Geneva legation if somehow American diplo mats might convince the Swiss government to appeal to Bulgarian officia ls to \"deblock the account.\" Lier was again refused. 52 The record is unclear exacdy how funds were funnele d to the Bulgarian company. But IBM Bulgaria was indeed funded and con tinued to supply punch card services to Bulgarian Railroads. In fact , more than a year later, Schotte told Carter that an extensively utilized ra nge of IBM equipment was still in operation in Sofia, including a vital inst allation serving Bulgarian Railroads. 53 On September 15, 1942, the Reich Foreign Office ele cted to delay the move to deport Bulgarian Jewry. Foreign Minister vo n Ribbentrop scribbled the words \"wait some more\" on a report summarizing the Bulgarian situa- tion. By the end of September 1942, however, he sud denly told Eichmann's people to proceed. 54 Bulgaria was unwilling to sacrifice its Jews.

Bulgarian Je wry was saved. Greek Jews would go to their death. Soon, the trains woul d roll. 55 On March 2, 1943, the Bulgarian cabinet, still unde r intense pressure from Germany, ratified the number of trains to be a llocated. A few days later, about 7,100 Macedonian Jews were pulled from their homes, congregated in tobacco warehouses, and later marched in long lines through the street. The women wore scarves and carried small bundles for th e journey. The men car- ried larger objects on their backs. They walked pas sively with helpless expressions on their faces. At the end of the stree t was the railroad station, Bulgarian Railroads. 56 In Thrace, the scenes were the same as more than 4, 200 were marched to the boxcars. Standing before simple wooden table s, littlde children looked up with uncertainty as their parents gave their nam es to men in black uni- forms jotting on note pads. Families crowded along the long ramp between the drab railroad building and the trains towering above them. Finally, they busded into the cold boxcars for the long journey t o a place they could not imagine. 57 Pulling through the still snowy mountains, creating long curving lines of boxcars and catde cars, Bulgarian Railroads deli vered its freight to the Danube port of Lorn. From there, the Jews were ship ped by boat to Vienna. At Vienna, they were transferred to other trains en route to their final desti- nation, Treblinka. 58 With or without punch cards, efficiently or ineffic iently, a determined Reich would have deported the doomed Greek Jews fro m Thrace and Mace- donia. If locomotives and catde cars were not avail able, Eichmann would have ordered a death march, as was done elsewhere i n Eastern Europe. Even in the Bulgaria action, river barges were employed. But Berlin's most consis- tently used transport mode was rail. At the height of the deportations, Himmler beseeched his Minister of Transport, \"If I am to wind things up quickly, I must have more trains. . . . Help me get more trains.\" Trains were Himmler's most valuable tool—and railroads were amo ng IBM's most lucra- tive clients in Europe. 59 February 14, 1945. With the war over in Bulgaria, I BM Geneva received permission from the American Consulate to re-establ ish relations with Wat- son Business Machines of Sofia. As they had in othe r countries, IBM NY asked for all financial records for the years 1942, 1943, and 1944.

IN THE NETWORK of European railroads that delivered Jews to the Ge rmans. Bulgarian Railroads was but a minor player. The Pol ish railroads transported millions to their fate, either to ghettos, forced w orked sites, or the gas cham- bers of Auschwitz and Treblinka. IBM's subsidiary i n Poland, Watson Buro- maschinen GmbH, serviced the railroads as its main account. Other IBM machines not used for the railways were moved into nearby Maschinelles Berichtwesen field offices or into Germany for serv ice there. 62 When the war was over, IBM NY made a priority of re covering the machines and assets of the machines used in Poland. In government filings, the company listed its prewar subsidiary, Watson Bu siness Machines on Ossolinskich 6, not the one it incorporated during the German occupation under the name Watson Buromaschinen GmbH on Kreuzst rasse 23. Nor did IBM fist its print shop across from the Warsaw ghet to at Rymarksa 6. But IBM NY did entreat the State Department and militar y liaisons to help recover its bank accounts, including two at Bank Ha ndlowy and one at Bank Emosyjny, as well as deposits in a post office cred it account. Even after Poland was liberated, when Polish machines transfer red to Germany proper were used, the Berlin-based enemy property custodia n made sure IBM's leasing fees were protected.

Hitler also supported the breaka way region of Croatia, which was the scene of Ustashi tortures. 64 But local conditions, no matter how atrocious, were always put aside. On January 3, 1942, for instance, the New York Time s prominently described the horrible bloodlust underway in Croatia. The art icle reported what it termed \"'only a pale picture' of the ghastly reign of terror . . . [where] hun- dreds of persons were killed, but before they died many of them had their ears and noses cut off and then were compelled to g raze on grass. The tor- tures most usually applied were beating, severing o f limbs, gouging of eyes and breaking of bones. Cases are related of men bei ng forced to hold red- hot bricks, dance on barbed wire with naked feet, a nd wear wreaths of thorns. Needles were stuck in fingers under the nai ls and lighted matches were held under noses.\" 65 The area's most savage concentration camp was at Ja senovac where unspeakable crimes were committed by Ustashi guards . Jasenovac was situ- ated on the Belgrade-Zagreb railroad line. 66 Despite any horrors, IBM continued its thriving ent erprise in Yugo- slavia, known as Yugoslav Watson AG. Before America entered the war, IBM NY had been shipping Belgrade as many as 3 million punch cards annually. In 1942, the German enemy custodian appointed IBM's manager, Vilimir Bajkic, to remain in charge of the subsidiary. Bajk ic was to coordinate with Germany's military commander in the area. Dr. Veese nmayer, Hitler's per- sonal representative to the Dehomag advisory commit tee, was a close ally of the Ustashi during their reign of terror. Throughou t the war, IBM cards and tabulators were used mainly by the Yugoslav army, t he Ministry of Com- merce, and Yugoslav railways. As in other Balkan st ates, IBM had made arrangements to service the military machines in re mote locations after war broke out. 67 Just before the Russians finally overran Yugoslavia in October 1944, many of the subsidiary's machines were hastily relo cated to German territory, transferred to the nearest MB field office, or plac ed at the disposal of the German Navy. IBM's people in Belgrade forwarded the billing records to Germany before the Russians arrived. Hence, the Rei ch could continue lease payments into a special custodial account opened in Berlin at the Deutsche Bank. The Reich's last regular payment to Yugoslav Watson, issued April 3, 1945, remitted RM 3,114.15.

By mid-1943, CEC was holding Nazi orders to taling more than FF 38 million, or RM 760 million; of this amount FF 7. 4 million had already been advanced. 70 Virgile was released briefly, but then re-arrested on September 19 along with CEC Assistant Sales Manager Pierre Basta rd. Other CEC officials feared they would be arrested as well. The American Embassy was notified and an urgent cable was sent to Watson. During the next few weeks, efforts to obtain the release of CEC staffers were unsucces sful. Watson was kept informed. 71 By October 17, 1944, William Borel, who had been ap pointed interim manager, wired Watson through the Embassy that IBM staffers were still in jail. \"With your intervention, we sincerely hope th at the company will soon be operating normally. Two days later, Borel cabled Watson again that key people were \"investigating situation which appears to have several angles. Everything is being done to clarify the whole matte r.\" Shortly thereafter, IBMers were suddenly released. Lavoegie resigned"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"and Virgile took leave from the company. No charges were ever preferred. CEC resumed normal business by November 2, 1944. Ev en though General Ruling 11 was still in effect, the subsidiary began sending IBM NY copies of new orders through \"various channels.\" 72 About a year later, Captain Gamzon, a Jewish office r from the French resistance was speaking to the United Jewish Appeal charity in New York. The UJA was raising funds to assist decimated Jewis h populations in Europe. The New York Times reported his remarks under the h eadline \"Jews in France Saved by Others.\" The article reported, \"Almost all surviving Jews in France owe their lives to non-Jews who risked everything t o save them from the Nazis when they overran and occupied that country. . . . Captain Gamzon, a former leader of the Maquis of France . . . told th e delegates that it can be said without exaggeration that any Jew now living i n France has been saved at one time or another by a non-Jew—by the police, who made believe they did not see those wanted by the Nazis, and by other s; many of them French officials who furnished false ration and identifica tion cards to Jews who were successfully hidden in the various districts. The c hildren specially have been saved, he said, by a people touched and saddened by the deportation of entire families.\" 73 Captain Gamzon stressed that 25,000 families were l ost. But so many more were saved due to the heroism and sacrifice of the resistance. He saluted the men and women of the underground, peopl e who had been tor- tured and deported to concentration camps, but neve r cracked. Rene Carmille was not there to hear those words. Carmill e was one of the valiant who died in Dachau rather than make the punch cards work. 74 It took more than a year of petitions through the S tate Department, but IBM was able to recover all of its French machines from across Europe. Eventually, it secured all the money in its bank ac counts at Credit Lyonnais. With the Holleriths back and the money recouped, th e war was over for IBM France. 75 S WITZERLAND WAS the commercial nexus of World War II. Its famous fi nan- cial secrecy laws, neutrality, and willingness to t rade with enemies made Switzerland the Reich's preferred repository for pi lfered assets and a switch- board for Nazi-era commercial intrigue. In 1935, wh en talk of war in Europe became pervasive, Watson moved the company's Europe an headquarters from Paris to Geneva. Doing business with Nazi Euro pe via Geneva involved a"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"constant ebb and flow of inchoerent blacklist enfor cement and acquiescence by American commercial attaches. Deals and denials characterized virtually the length and breadth of IBM's presence in Geneva. 76 Murky transactions were fundamentally untraceable s ince they could filter through a maze of banks or their branches, m any of them newly created by Germany, scattered across occupied and neutral c ountries. New York branches of Swiss banks only complicated the trail, prompting Treasury officials in Washington to dispatch squads of inves tigators to Manhattan seeking evidence of trade with the enemy. 77 Information even reached the Treasury that IBM migh t help establish its own international bank to link Nazi and America n economic interests, thus only further obscuring Reich transactions and financing projects. In early 1942, the Treasury Department's Monetary Rese arch Division moved quickly to block any such initiative. On July 13, 1 942, Acting Treasury Secre- tary D. W. Bell took the unusual precaution of cont acting Watson directly to stymie the possibility. Watson quickly declared nei ther he nor his company were involved in the enterprise, directly or throug h surrogates. For emphasis Acting Secretary Bell sent Watson an extraordinary, almost accusatory acknowledgment of his declaration: \"Treasury takes note of your statement that the International Business Machines Corporatio n has no knowledge of any plan for the formation of an inter-continental credit bank financed jointly by American, French, and German capital. Th e Treasury also acknowl- edges your statement that the International Busines s Machines Corporation has not authorized and will not authorize anyone to act for it in the forma- tion of such a bank.\" 78 Bell added this clear warning to Watson: \"You are, of course, aware that any action in connection with such a bank would be illegal unless done in conformity with the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act and For- eign Funds Control.\" 79 Watson snapped back to Bell with a rare one-sentenc e letter: \"Referring to the last paragraph of your letter of July 13, I was aware that the plans were illegal and that is why I wanted the Treasury Department to know that no one with our company had discussed or had anythi ng to do with the proposition.\" 80 Any illusion that IBM NY would not receive regular reports from its European agents about the most detailed operational vicissitudes was contra- dicted by the numerous Monthly Narratives, quarterl y financial reports, and special punch card requests funneled through Sweden , Switzerland, Spain, and America's own diplomatic pouches. 81 "},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"Certainly, the record was well papered to protect I BM's legal position. From 1942 to 1945, IBM NY would wire uncharacterist ically verbose and belabored instructions to its managers in neutral E urope to repossess ma- chines, stop trading with subsidiaries in enemy cou ntries, and terminate con- tracts with blacklisted firms. 82 Each such instruction stood out as a veritable disquisition of deniability laced with highly patri otic rationales for obeying the law against trading with the enemy. But when bl acklists arrived, Watson's most trusted managers in Sweden and Switzerland wou ld \"get strangely busy,\" as one IBM internal probe termed it. Or mana gers would ignore New York's lengthy tractates to stop direct trading wit h Axis nations—sometimes delaying more than a year. In the case of IBM in Sw eden, a Department of Justice investigator recorded that it was not un til April 1943, more than one year after Swedish manager Tag Lundberg first r eceived instructions to \"cease trading with the enemy,\" that the wholly-own ed subsidiary complied with an explicit order from New York. 83 In many instances, elaborate docu- ment trails in Europe were fabricated to demonstrat e compliance when the opposite was true. 84 Nonetheless, the true record would be permanently obscured. During the war years, IBM's own internal reviews co nceded that cor- respondence about its European business primarily t hrough its Geneva office was often faked. 85 Dates were falsified. 86 Revised contract provisions were proffered to hide the true facts. 87 Misleading logs and chronologies were kept. 88 During the protracted delays, millions of punch car ds would be hur- riedly shipped by IBM's neutral country subsidiarie s to enemy countries or blacklisted customers. 89 At IBM, time was more than money. Time was punch cards. Once a million cards were punched, the y could never be unpunched. At the vortex of every economic masque in Switzerla nd was Werner Lier, IBM's European Manager in Geneva until German y surrendered. As such, he was the company's top officer in Europe in volved with virtually every transaction in every country throughout the w ar. 90 Yet even IBM's own review at the time concluded that Lier's dates, dec larations, and documenta- tion amounted to a prolonged and elaborate series o f charades. For instance, in late March 1942, Lier negotiated c ontracts with two blacklisted Swiss munitions companies. Yet on April 27, 1942, Lier sent a cable to IBM NY pretending that the two newly negot iated contracts were actually signed before the war, and then openly ask ing New York to petition the U.S. government for a special exemption: \"U.S. Commercial Attache Bern"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"requests we cancel contracts,\" cabled Lier. \"Can yo u intervene to maintain installations on basil contracts signed before war. \" 91 But IBM's own internal review later confirmed, \"This is a definitely misle ading statement because, apart from the two contracts here under considerati on, three other contracts had been signed by the customer after the United St ates had entered into the war . . . the machines were supplied and billed by Geneva, and payment accepted. Mr. Lier made thereby a deliberately misl eading statement.... This deception is the more serious since none of the con tracts signed before the war existed any longer.\" 92 IBM also found a pattern of falsified dates. For in stance, Lier sent IBM NY a cable July 21, 1942, asserting that a Type 954 Hollerith was installed at a blacklisted customer site in Switzerland on Decem ber 31, 1941. However, IBM's own fraud review, citing its Installation Rep ort No. 22, proved the machine was actually installed on March 31, 1942, w ith rent beginning in April 1942.93 Foot-dragging, false logs, and contrived chronologi es were common- place at IBM Geneva. For example, Lier had created an extensive log to demonstrate how he regularly complied with American consular officials in Bern who demanded IBM cease business with blacklist ed companies. Even- tually, IBM had to admit in a letter: \"Thus it has taken Mr. Lier thirteen days to inform Mr. Herzog [an IBM sales manager] that tw o of his customers appeared on the 'Black List,' when he [Lier] could have informed Mr. Herzog by telephone on the day he was in possession of thi s information—namely on March 25 [1942]. 94 In consequence,\" the company letter continued, \"[American Commercial Attache Daniel] Reagan had pi erced the mystery surrounding this case and [refused] . . . to accept M r. Lier's .. . chronological report, inasmuch as he accuses him of having had th ese contracts five days after he [Lier] knew that these customers were on t he Black List.\" 95 On occasion, even IBM NY could no longer unravel th e ruses its key managers were weaving. IBM's own internal review of one case confessed that after June 1942, \"we lose track of the case as the correspondence relat- ing thereto was withdrawn from the files.\" 96 Despite IBM's own internal reviews summarizing a pa ttern of impropri- eties, Watson allowed Lier to continue at his pivot al post. Watson himself set the stage for IBM Europe's warti me conduct. In October 1941, he circulated instructions to all sub sidiaries: \"In view of world conditions we cannot participate in the affairs of our companies in various countries as we did in normal times. Therefore you are advised that you will have to make your own decisions and not call on us for any advice or assis-"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"tance until further notice.\" 97 That instruction never asked IBM executives to stop trading with the Hitler regime, or place a hal t on sales to the camps, the war machine, or any German occupying authority. Wat son only asked his companies to stop informing the New York office abo ut their activities. Despite the illusion of non-involvement, IBM NY con tinued to play a central role in the day-to-day operations of its su bsidiaries. Company sub- sidiaries regularly traded with Axis-linked blackli sted companies in neutral countries, and even directly with Germany and Italy . 98 It was business as usual throughout the war. As a Swiss national, Lier freely traveled to and fr om Germany, occu- pied territories, and neutral countries micro-manag ing company affairs for Watson.\" Six months after Watson declared IBM Headquarters t o be cut off from its overseas units, Lier himself defined IBM G eneva's role not as an autonomous, detached office—but as a nexus, which s imply implemented the business decisions made by IBM NY. On April 29, 1942, Lier outlined for the American Consul in Geneva exactly how IBM G eneva operated. \"You will readily understand,\" explained Lier, \"that thi s office is a clearing office between the local organizations in the various coun tries and the New York Headquarters.\" Lier added that IBM NY made all the decisions. His function was simply to monitor the business and keep the rec ords. \"The European Headquarters in Geneva,\" he explained, \"are, in a w ay, a representative of the World Headquarters in New York, whose job it is to manage and control European affairs. ... In short, the functions of th e Geneva Office are purely administrative.\" 100 Lier emphasized, \"When the local offices require ma chines or material from our factories in the United States, they pass the order to the Geneva Office which, in turn, transmits it to the New York Headquarters for handling and supplying the machines direct to the local offi ce.\" 101 Perhaps IBM's business philosophy was best expresse d by an executive of Beige Watson in an August 1939 letter to senior officers of IBM NY. The letter detailed the company's growing involvement i n Japan's aircraft indus- try. The IBM Brussels executive declared: \"It is no ne of our business to judge the reasons why an American corporation shoul d or would help a for- eign Government, and consequently Mr. Decker and my self have left these considerations entirely out of our line of thought. ... we are, as IBM men, interested in the technical side of the application of our machines.\" 102 But as European territory was liberated in late 194 4 and early 1945, re-established national authorities began to hold c ommercial collaborators"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"responsible. French arrests of IBM people in Paris - despite their ultimate release—were charaeteristic of the liberation fervo r gripping Europe. Lier himself had been the center of many rumors. One sto ry suggested that he had transported Dehomag money to Vichy in harrowing nighttime runs across occupied France. 103 Another story hinted that Lier was wanted by the p ost- War authorities even in Switzerland for bending the financial statutes. 104 All the facts surrounding IBM's cloudy dealings in Geneva will prob- ably never come to light, but this much became clea r at the time: once the war ended, Lier needed to disappear from Geneva in a hurry. Lier had no choice. He could only escape by traveling through F rance. So at the end of 1944, just after French intelligence arrested CEC m anagers, Lier tried to arrange his immediate departure from Europe by appl ying for a French travel visa at the French Consulate in Geneva. 105 But on January 3, the French For- eign Ministry instructed the French Consulate to de ny Lier's visa request, thus keeping him where he was. The French Consulate took its time inform- ing Lier, and only confirmed the denial on January 12, 1945. 106 Moreover, even if Lier could leave Switzerland, com mercial officers at the American Legation in Bern were reluctant to gra nt him a temporary visa to enter the United States on the grounds his entry might be \"detrimental to the public safety.\" They expressed themselves in an exchange of correspon- dence on January 16. But several days later, senior diplomats intervened. American Consul Paul Squire was told in a letter by legation officer J. Klahr Huddle. \"Supplementing my letter,\" wrote Huddle, \"I now have to inform you that the files in the case of Werner C. Lier ha ve been carefully examined by the interested officers of this Legation. After careful consideration of the case, it is our considered opinion that Mr. Lier's entry into the United States on a temporary visitor's visa would not prove 'detr imental to the public safety,' and it is believed that in your discretion you may act accordingly with respect to Mr. Lier's application for a visa.\" 107 However, even when U.S. officials agreed to issue a visa, Lier still could not enter French territory to effect his exit from Europe and travel to Amer- ica. Yet sometime in the first two weeks of Februar y 1945, Lier did indeed suddenly disappear. 108 Camille Delcour, a longtime French IBM director, wa s astonished when he reported to the Paris subsidiary on February 12. He penned a message. On coming to the IBM office on Monday morning, Febr uary 12, a notice was pinned on the notice board. This notice informe d us that Mr. Lier was on his way to the States, \"a rapid means of transpo rtation necessitating a hur-"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"ried departure having been placed at my disposal\" a nd that he regretted not having the opportunity to ta k e leave of the staff. What is surprising to us is not only his strange wa y of eloping, but how he has found his ways and means to cross France since we know for a definite fact that the French transit visa for which he appl ied . . . was refused to him on January 12, 1945. It seems that the invitation for him to go over to the States emanates from Mr. Schotte. Whether this invitation was extended w ithout a direct provoca- tion by Lier is uncertain. I am cabling Mr. Watson warning him not to be guided by anything Lier may say before a responsibl e N.Y. official has inves- tigated the whole Geneva situation. Camille Delcour IBM 109 No one could understand how Lier managed to escape. As late as sum- mer 1945, Bern Commercial Attache Reagan had writte n to the French Embassy reviewing the French Foreign Ministry's dec ision to deny Lier the right to enter their territory. \"We have since lear ned,\" informed Reagan, \"that Mr. Lier successfully reached the United States and we would like to know how he could have traveled through France without t he necessary visa. If you have information about this subject, I would be grateful if you would inform me.\" 110 But it should have been plain to consular officials in Bern. The man in Switzerland who intervened for Lier was America's M ilitary Attache, Brig. Gen. Barnwell Legge, an experienced hand at smuggli ng people into and out of Switzerland. Consular officials had already expl ained in a prior letter that General Legge was one of two senior foreign service officers who had proffered his written justification for allowing Li er into the United States. The other was the Consul General himself, a man who had transferred in from the German Embassy in Berlin. That new Consul General was Sam Woods—the same Sam Woods who helped IBM during Deho mag's revolt, and who later helped Lier move Holleriths from Pola nd to Romania. 111 For Werner C. Lier and IBM Geneva, the war was over ."},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"XV THE S P O I L S OF G E N O C I D E , II WHEN WORLD WAR II ENDED IN EUROPE, TH E CONTINENT was shattered and in disarray. Millions of all fait hs and nationalities were dead. For millions more—displaced persons, tattered victi ms, and fatigued combatants—it would be years before they could reco ver. Yet, Dehomag emerged from the Hitler years with rel atively little damage and virtually ready to resume busines s as usual. Its machines had been salvaged, its profits preserved, and its corporate value protected. Hence, when the war ended, IBM NY was able to recapture its problematic but valuable German subsi diary, recover its machines, and assimilate all the profits. As early as December 1943, the United States govern ment concluded that Hitler's Holleriths were strategic m achines to save, not destroy. Dehomag's equipment held the keys to a smooth mili- tary occupation of Germany and the other Axis terri tories. By June 1944, Carter's investigative reports on IBM and Deh omag had been adapted into a confidential War Department Pamphlet , 31-123, en- tided Civil Affairs Guide: Preservation and Use of Key Records in Ger- many. Over several dozen pages, key government and Party offices were listed by street address with a description of their punch card machines and data. On page 18, the Ministry of Labo r entry declared, \"Their records are of the utmost importance as they are the means"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"by which the Germans controlled and shifted manpowe r, and should there- fore be a valuable source of information for the oc cupying authorities. On pages 19-20, the Ministry of Transportation entry e xplained, \"The up-to-date reports disclose the location and number of trains available in each territory, traffic density, tonnage over a particular line, ty pe of cars used, type of materi- als shipped. ... As the smooth running of the railr oad system is of primary importance ... in administering the occupied territ ory, all records should be placed under military custody.\" 1 The War Department's Civil Affairs Guide citation o n page 21 for Police Records specified, \"records on aliens and Jews are kept by a special depart- ment of the police, the Fremdenpolizei (alien polic e). ... By an elaborate tech- nique, that is kept rigorously up to date, the poli ce are enabled to trace the movements of practically everyone in the country.\" On page 58, in the \"Gestapo Card Index,\" section subsection B was enti tled \"Register of In- mates of Concentration Camps.\" It confirmed: \"The G estapo Directorates and Offices keep the register of inmates of concentrati on camps in the areas under their jurisdiction. Copies are to be found in the concentration camps themselves.\" 2 Appendix B of the Civil Affairs Guide identified th e Dehomag factories and summarized the operational basics of Hollerith tabulators, sorters, verifi- ers, and multipliers. 3 British intelligence was also keen to maintain Germ an Holleriths intact to facilitate the occupation. A British paper revie wing the Reich Statistical Office asserted, \"If the German statistical staffs at the Ministry of Economics and at subordinate levels continue to function, it will not require a great number of people to take charge. If, however, the G erman system . . . has been disrupted and the records sabotaged, it would be a long and arduous, though necessary, task to reconstitute it.\" 4 German forces were just as eager to safeguard their IBM equipment, albeit for their own reasons. As the Allies liberat ed territories from the east and west, precious machines were moved behind defen sible fines for the Reich's continued use. As late as 1945, der Fuhrer himself had issued a decree placing a new emphasis on punch card technol ogy for registering and tracking all Germans needed for the defense of the Reich. He appointed Karl-Hermann Frank, former military governor of occ upied Czechoslovakia as a new plenipotentiary for punch card registratio n. Frank would be able to supercede the authority of the Maschinelles Bericht wesen (MB), the Zentral Institut, and all other party and state offices. \"I n this capacity, he has to answer to me personally,\" declared Hitler. Der Fuhr er added that the commit-"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"tee advising Frank would be chaired by Rudolf Schme er, the official who spoke for the Party at the original 1934 opening of Dehomag's Lichterfelde factory. Schmeer still enjoyed a commanding role at the MB. 5 More than just the strategic need to evacuate the e quipment to safer ground, Hitler's Holleriths constituted damning evi dence. Hence, when con- centration camps were abandoned, the machines were moved and files de- stroyed to obliterate the record of war crimes. In many cases, Hollerith devices from various Reich sites were not redeploye d, but simply hidden to keep them from Allied confiscation. However, as the Allies closed in on Berlin, military intelligence tracked many of the m achines. 6 A major MB punching operation of almost 100 Holleri th machines at its Wendisch-Reitz office was shifted in part to Otto's Hotel, while its tabulators were installed at a nearby casde, and the remaining devices were shipped by rail to Neudientendorf for reassembly in the bas ement of the Riesbeck brewery. Allied forces arrived at the brewery befor e the machines could be activated. Machines from Krakow and Posen were also moved to sites in Neudietendorf. Tabulators and sorters in Koenigsber g were thought to have been loaded onto a boat that escaped before Allied armies arrived. Hol- leriths at Hannover were moved to Elze. Nuremberg m achines were relo- cated to Brauhaus Street in Ansbach. Tabulator expe rts at Kassel shipped their gear to Oberaula, but first removed several s mall components, render- ing them inoperative if Allied forces discovered th e systems. 7 With both sides trying to protect the Holleriths, t he evidence on exactly where and how thousands of machines were used was a ll but obscured. This was particularly the case in concentration camps wh ere the Hollerith Depart- ments were generally dismantled before liberators a rrived, even if some of the cards, decoding keys, and telltale Hollerith transf er paper were left behind. 8 Thus, almost as soon as Germany capitulated, IBM co uld begin the process of recovering its valuable equipment from frequendy innocuous sites. IBM's money was protected with equal fervor. During the war, the Reich needed IBM subsidiaries in Nazi Europe to continue operating in a reliable, profitable mode. At first, the Reich appointed a te mporary enemy property custodian, Dr. Kottgen. He simply re-appointed IBM' s most trusted managers in virtually all the territories. 9 By 1943, however, the Reich Economics Ministry had designated Her- mann B. Fellinger as custodian over Dehomag. Fellin ger was one of Ger- many's most reliable and commercially adept Kommiss ars. In WWI, he had served as the chief Kommissar overseeing all other custodians of enemy prop- erty. In France, where Westerholt officiated as pre liminary custodian at CEC,"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"Kellinger was empowered to supersede and ultimately replace him. Ulti- mately, Kellinger's a u t h o r i t y extended not only to Dehomag, but also to IBM companies in Norway, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Po land, and France. Fellinger also coordinated closely with a second cu stodian, H. Garbrecht, who oversaw the IBM operating units in Belgium and Holland, and with Home's appointed official at Watson Italiana. Real estate attorney Oskar Mohring was named custodian for IBM's property and other commercial interests in Nazi Europe. 10 On assuming his position, Fellinger immediately re- designated IBM's best managers to keep the subsidiaries productive a nd profitable. He only ex- cised one IBM personality: Dehomag Chairman Willy H eidinger. A four-man Advisory Committee, including Veesenmayer, quickly replaced Dehomag's Board of Directors. That outraged the combative Hei dinger who saw his power suddenly neutralized. On June 18, 1943, Heidi nger wrote a long, bit- ter defense of his involvement with the company, go ing back to its inception in 1910. His diatribe railed that Watson's interferenc e had been the cause of all problems. Dehomag was German not American, he argue d, and should not be administered for IBM's benefit, but instead comp letely Aryanized. 11 \"Contrary to what has on occasion been alleged,\" pr otested Heidinger, \"it was, therefore, not a case of us Germans partic ipating in an American enterprise, but rather of Americans participating i n a German enterprise that I created ... I have been blamed for many other thi ngs, in an unfounded and partly contradictory manner. Among other things, I was told I was merely a figurehead for the Americans; on the other hand, it was not very nice of me to act so aggressively towards the Americans now th at I had waxed rich because of them. The opposite is true: It is not a case of my having become wealthy because of the Americans, but rather of the Americans having become wealthy because of me.\" 12 Further undercutting him, Fellinger ruled that the company was no longer obligated to re-purchase Heidinger's stock. Heidinger would have un- doubtedly pressed claims against Fellinger and done his utmost to regain control of Dehomag. But Heidinger's battle came to an end several months after his angry apologia to Fellinger. Deterioratin g health eventually won out over the indomitable Dehomag founder. In 1944, Heidinger died of natural causes. 13 With Heidinger out of the way, Fellinger was free t o operate Dehomag and its sphere of influence as he saw fit. In that vein, he was far more than just an inert oversight officer. Fellinger function ed with as much commercial zeal and dedication to the IBM enterprise as any se nior executive Watson"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"could have personally selected. It was exactly as W atson had envisioned. Ger- many's custodian, Fellinger, was t h e perfect soluti on to the Dehomag revolt and the predicament of a business alliance with the Third Reich while Amer- ica was fighting a war with Germany. In Norway, Fellinger received regular progress repo rts from Watson Norsk's longtime manager, Jens Tellefson. Fellinger limited his involvement to \"smoothing his [Tellefson's] path with [various Reich] departments, and especially the German occupation authorities.\" When machines and parts could no longer be imported directly from New York, Fellinger arranged for imports from \"Watson Italiana and Dehomag. Tellefso n purchased the Italian and German machines not in the Norwegian subsidiary 's name, but in the name of IBM NY to preserve the American parent comp any's claim to the property being used in occupied Norway. When the No rwegian company ran low on card stock, Fellinger also arranged for supp lies through Dehomag's paper vendors. 14 At one point, Norwegian saboteurs used explosives t o destroy Watson Norsk's offices. They hoped to disrupt the company' s in-house servicing of the Nazi labor office, which coordinated both consc ripted and slave workers. Anticipating such an attack, Tellefson had arranged for Nazi records to be moved off-site daily. Nonetheless, most of the IBM machines serving the labor office were crippled in the bomb attack. So F ellinger approved relocat- ing the IBM office to a more secure neighborhood wi th replacement machin- ery. This allowed IBM's lucrative service to contin ue. In Norway, annual revenues doubled from 161,000 crowns in 1940 to 334 ,000 crowns in 1943, and declined only slightly in 1944, just months bef ore Norway was liberated in 1945. Fellinger attributed Watson Norsk's excell ent performance to \"wartime conditions.\" 15 In dismantled Czechoslovakia, Fellinger allowed Wat son's handpicked director, Emil Kuczek, to remain in command. Fellin ger was pleased that \"Kuczek has conducted the business with great care and expert knowledge . . . acting conscientiously in the interest of tha t company.\" He remembered that Kuczek \"always acted in complete harmony with myself.\" The Czech sub- sidiary's card printing capacity was doubled thanks to a transfer of printing presses and paper cutters from Dehomag. In turn, th e Czech subsidiary filled Dehomag's punch card orders. A number of Czech mach ines were assigned to \"German railways in the East.\" Kuczek accepted a ll machine rental pay- ments, but did not provide any receipts. He deposit ed the money in IBM's account at Prague Kreditbank. IBM Geneva in turn no tified Kreditbank that Kuczek was permitted to freely spend up to 20 perce nt of the deposits to pay"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"for ordinary subsidiary operations such as s a l a r i e s and rent. 16 In this way, Czech operations were routinely funded without any written instructions from IBM NY, and service rendered with a minimal paper t rail. Fellinger worked hard to keep the Czech division's profits high. He insisted on eliminating discounts, limiting expense s, and even added a bonus to Kuczek's contract based on net profits. From 194 1 to 1944, Czech punch card revenue alone doubled from 2.6 million crowns to nearly 5.3 million. 17 Fellinger showed equal diligence in his administrat ion of the other IBM subsidiaries under his control, such as Poland and Yugoslavia. The devoted receiver never failed to demand the best terms and formulate the most con- servative business decisions to protect the compani es he administered. 18 Fellinger even put IBM's interest before that of th e Third Reich, con- stantly badgering Berlin to pay more rent, and clea r up its delinquencies. He even demanded that the Wehrmacht pay for CEC mac hines the German military seized from occupied France. It took month s of burdensome legal wrangling, but Fellinger successfully argued that t he German military had no right to remove CEC's machines without properly com pensating IBM. His argument hammered away at the theme that because th e plundered machines were leased items, they never belonged to the Frenc h government, but to IBM. As such, the transferred devices were not subject t o traditional rules of \"war booty.\" Only after reams of Fellinger's dense brief s, supported by attestations by CEC Managing Director Roger Virgile, did the MB finally consent to nearly a million Reichsmarks in back rent for machines tra nsported out of France. 19 Even when 308 leasing contracts—one for each requis itioned machine —were printed and submitted to CEC, at the last min ute Fellinger asked Virgile to withhold signature. Fellinger learned th at the MB had negotiated slightly better maintenance discounts with the cust odian for IBM units in Belgium and Holland. Only after an adjustment guara nteeing parity did Fellinger finally agree. To replace the 308 now obs olete leasing contracts, Fellinger proposed reducing the entire agreement to a punch card but won- dered about the validity of a \"punch card signature .\" Ultimately, the parties relied on traditional written contracts. 20 Dehomag engineer Oskar Hoermann, who doubled as CEC 's deputy custodian, transmitted the basic format for the 308 leases to Paris. During the war years, Hoermann stayed in contact with IBM NY by various means, including posting ordinary letters—casual and forma l—from Vichy France. For example, in April 1942, while transiting from B erlin through Vichy, Hoermann mailed a handwritten \"Dear Jimmy\" letter t o manufacturing exec- utives at Endicott, New York, routinely reporting f actory developments at"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"Dehomag and CEC. From Vichy, Hoermann also was free to communicate with Lier in Geneva. The protracted negotiations wi th the MB specified the number of hours IBM machines could he used each mon th, thus limiting wear and tear, as well as monthly rental fees. CEC managers in combination with Fellinger stubbornly held out for the best ter ms, yielding the most money for IBM. Until the agreement was finalized, C EC was willing to just wait for its back rent. 21 On June 16, 1944, an MB official finally noted for his file, \"Fellinger has received the basic agreement signed by us and will give it today to his CEC representative, Mr. Hoermann, who is currently in B erlin. Mr. Hoermann will take it with him to Paris, where General Director V irgile will sign it. . . . The essential factor, however, is that after four years [of negotiation dating back to the invasion of France], a basic agreement is be ing signed.\" 22 Fellinger's counterpart in Amsterdam, H. Garbrecht, who administered IBM companies in Holland and Belgium, exhibited sim ilar assiduity in se- curing payment for machines removed from subsidiari es under his control. Working with IBM managers in Brussels and Amsterdam , Garbrecht finalized contracts that were typeset into a formal lease con tract. Each contract de- clared at the top that the agreement was between th e Maschinelles Bericht- wesen in Berlin and \"International Business Machine s Corporation-New York\" through the German administrator in Amsterdam or alternatively in Brussels. Details about the specific machine, its s erial number, monthly rent, permissible hours of usage each month, and service terms were typed into the provided spaces. Although the numerous contract s were all executed on September 15, 1943, rental terms and fees were made retroactive to the sum- mer of 1942, depending upon when the specific machi nes were transferred to Reich offices. 23 For example, contract series #091/1/0094/43 for a m odel 034 dupli- cating alphabetizing puncher, serial number 10167, specified rent at RM 127.47 per month, retroactive to August 13, 1942; t he device was deployed at the MB field office in Munich. A model 405 alphabet izing tabulator with an automatic cart, serial number 13430, cost RM 945.76 monthly, retroactive to August 26, 1942. Monthly billing tallies were gener ated until war's end, spec- ifying combined rental fees at such departments as the Foreign Ministry, Ger- man Navy, Luftwaffe, or Inspectorate Seven. None of the contracts executed through custodian Garbrecht exploited IBM. In fact, German officials com- plained the hard bargain they agreed to was fundame ntally unfair because the Reich was liable to pay for any damage caused b y war action. 24 With all the fervor of a Watson devotee, Fellinger also blocked any po-"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"tential rivals. For exampe, in early August 1944, w hen the potential competi- tion posed by the Wanderer-Werke alliance appeared, Fellinger challenged its patent rights in Germany. To avoid litigation, Wand erer-Werke was forced to accept Fellinger's stringent, almost dictatorial li censing agreement. Dehomag would receive a 4 percent royalty on every Bull mac hine imported into Ger- many. The 4 percent level was expressed as a tempor ary wartime royalty, to be increased after the conflict stopped. Fellinger' s agreement demanded, \"You will inform us about the type, the number, the date of import and the final purpose of every Bull machine imported.\" To f urther hush Wanderer- Werke's presence in the market, the license agreeme nt stipulated, \"You will not use these machines for advertising purposes.\" I n the end, Fellinger's many procedural delays in Germany and the liberatio n of France in August 1944 combined to effectively stymie the delivery of any Bull machines into the Reich. 25 Thus, Dehomag's virtual monopoly was preserved. Through the devoted administration of Fellinger and other Axis custo- dians, Dehomag and the other IBM subsidiaries in Eu rope thrived. Their custodial authority stopped when Germany surrendere d. It would be a long bureaucratic and uncharted process for IBM to recla im its property. Fortu- nately, Watson could rely upon another column of su pport: the IBM Soldiers. A MERICAN SOLDIERS in Europe fought valiantly to defeat the Nazi nemes is. Part of their mission was to take control of German facilities and seize evi- dence of Nazi war crimes and collaboration. Whether the target was an in- dustrial site, a bank, a military base, or a concen tration camp, it was all enemy property to be referred to commanders, and possibly war crime prosecutors. But among American forces, there existed a cohesive group of men with a common identification. As former employees of Int ernational Business Machines on leave from their company jobs, they aff ectionately referred to themselves as \"IBM Soldiers.\" The framework for IBM's continuing bond with its em ployees at war began long before America joined the conflict. At C hristmas 1940, Watson informed all employees soon to be drafted into the military that they would be granted three months pay, up to $4,000, while ab sent. The money would be paid to inductees in twelve monthly installments , a comforting stipend for the family back home while the men were in uniform. 26 Making it clear they were still part of the IBM Fam ily with careers wait- ing after military service, Watson announced, \"We s hall miss you during the time you are away, but we feel that your year's tra ining will be beneficial to"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"you physically mentally and morally. As a result of this training, we believe you will come back to our company better equipped f or future service in the IBM.... If such is the case, you will be given an o pportunity to earn increased compensation. We want you to know that yo ur friends in the com- pany are back of you in every way, and if at any ti me we can be of help to you please let us know.\" 27 When the U.S. military formed its Machine Record Un its (MRU), IBM employees, or those IBM had trained, became the bac kbone of the elite MRU forces. IBMers also commanded in other key area s, especially in administrative units, where their experience would be instrumental. In the minds of many of these men, unswerving loyalty to T homas Watson and devotion to IBM was completely consistent with mili tary discipline in the field and loyalty to the Allied cause. As a result, when IBM Soldiers hap- pened upon Dehomag equipment and factories, they di d not see evidence of a war crime to docket or a key Nazi industrial instal lation to capture. They saw something inspiring and beloved that needed protect ion and to be returned to its rightful owner. IBM's cause was their cause. S OMEWHERE IN G ERMANY Thursday, April 26, 1945 Dear Mr. Watson: Today I received your letter of congratulations upo n my promotion to Corporal. It is impossible to state the wonderfu l effects your letter gives me especially as a morale builder. And in thi s respect I feel cer- tain that I am speaking for each and every one of t he fellow IBM Sol- diers. Your letters and those of the executives rec eived by us go a long way to make our lives over here in the ETC [Europea n Theater Com- mand] a much happier one. It seems appropriate that today I should receive yo ur letter; the day I returned from paying a visit to the \"Deutsche Hol lerith Maschinen Gesellschaft\" in Sindelfingen. My Captain, a fellow [IBM] soldier, and myself were the first Americans to set foot in the plant since the war. [Dehomag employees] Mr. Otto Haug and Mr. Wiesinger were our per- sonal guides and I can assure you, Mr. Watson that I felt a little thrilled seeing on a small scale what I witnessed in your fa ctory at Endicott in the winter of 1940. The entire [Dehomag] factory is intact, spared for some unknown reason by our airmen. At Sindelfingen, I found a sub-assembly plant with many parts on"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"hand and in very good condition. Every tool, every machine is well- preserved ready to start work at a moment's notice. ... a card stock of over a million cards [is] ready for shipment plus t wo hundred rolls of paper stock, stored away securely in a properly ventilated cellar. At Holzgerlingen, six kilometers south of Sindelfin gen there is a service bureau; two tabulators type 297, one multip lier—601, two sorters—080, 522 summary key punch and four key pun ches—016. Mr. Haug moved the service bureau here because it a ppeared safer from bombing attacks. Time and duty did not permit me to investigate furt her but the fol- lowing items Mr. Haug gave me: all spare parts and replacement parts were moved from Stuttgart to Kuchen. Here also you shall find the wiring department, plugboard and small assembly pla nts. Hechingen is the gathering point for all sub-assemblies. Here ev erything was assem- bled and Mr. Haug believes the plant is not bombed but in good con- dition. At Berlin, there is still a sub-unit assemb ly plant. Mr. Rottke, Mr. Hummel and Mr. Haug sometime in last autumn mad e all the above changes ... as a safety measure. At Sindelfin gen, Mr. Haug and Mr. Wiesinger have done a wonderful job in spite of very trying diffi- culties and the plant being 100% intact could be ve ry beneficial to the Allied Armies for spare parts, paper stock and such. As you so well know Mr. Watson, fraternization is f orbidden, but in this instance I was working under orders handed dow n in a directive to all MRUs from the Supreme Headquarters. All my d ealings with Mr. Haug and Mr. Wiesinger were only of this nature but I know they would like to be remembered to you. Sincerely yours, James T. Senn Fourth MRU 28 Senn's letter was typical. Watson received reports from any number of sources, whether IBM Soldiers or Dehomag employees. Dehomag staffers were able to direct their messages through IBM Sold iers, who would pass them on through the ordinary mail. Whether an IBM S oldier or a Dehomag employee, most asked for instructions guiding their next effort on behalf of the corporation. For example, on May 10, just two days after Berlin fell, Dehomag en- gineer Alfred Dicke, dutifully dispatched an emerge ncy message to Watson in New York: \"Hereby I wish to inform you,\" reporte d Dicke, \"of the transfer"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"of the Patent Department... from the plant in Berli n to Hechingen/Hohen- zollern, a town... which you know from your visit i n former days. On account of the frequent air attacks on Berlin and t he approach of the Allied Armies it became impossible to remain in Berlin any longer, and it was nec- essary to bring the valuable patent files, of which many documents cannot be reproduced, to safer places. 29 \"The plant in Berlin,\" Dicke continued, \"has been g radually destroyed by incendiary bombs since 1943. Most of the departm ents have been trans- ferred to different places in southern Germany, so that one cannot speak any more of a main office in Berlin. . . . Would you fi nd it advisable to move the complete files to the 'Compagnie Electro-Comptable' . . . [in] Paris or to the 'International Business Machines Corporation' in Ge neva?\" 30 On August 22, 1945, Capt. Leonard V. Salisbury, A C ompany, 750 Tank Battalion, sent a short note to IBM advising that a letter from IBM's Berlin tax attorney had been sent via the Rochester, New Y ork, factory. Salisbury also dispatched a report of his own personal inspec tion of the Lichterfelde factory and office. \"The outstanding observation I noticed,\" reported Salis- bury, \"was the optimism of [Dehomag managers] Mr. C imbal, Mr. Kolm and Mr. Brockman for the future business of IBM in this , a shattered city. With such a spirit, the future is very bright. If I can be of any aid as liaison or oth- erwise will be only be too glad to do so . . . I hope to see all my IBM friends by Christmas.\" 31 The same steady flow of information reached IBM NY from American forces elsewhere in liberated Europe. In one instan ce, IBM became impatient for reports on the Dehomag facility in Austria when it had heard no news for three weeks. William W Bass of IBM NY's Foreign Tra de Department commu- nicated with his son, an army lieutenant stationed in Vienna. Lieutenant Bass in turn provided a report which was passed from the military headquarters in Vienna to the State Department in Washington, and f rom there to IBM NY. 32 In the chaotic first months of the Allied occupatio n of Germany, a faith- ful, if officious, network of IBM Soldiers tried to outdo each other in advanc- ing the cause of Dehomag. Perhaps none caused the w aves that Lt. Col. Lawrence G. Flick did. The Russians arrested Rottke on May 11 for his Nazi connections. Allied forces arrested Hummel shortly thereafter. Lieutenant Colonel Flick, an MRU officer, tried his best to he lp IBM by restoring Deho- mag's prior management. 33 On September 2, 1945, Flick wrote a long letter to Watson. \"I am leav- ing Berlin tomorrow for Frankfurt,\" he advised. 'Th ere I shall endeavor to locate Karl Hummel and do what I can to expedite hi s return to Berlin. As"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"you will see later there is a considerable differen ce of opinion amongst those involved in handling the affairs of Dehomag. But on two things all seem to be agreed. One is the return of Dr. Rottke. This I am afraid is highly prob- lematical. Although some have returned after arrest by the Russians, they are few and usually not in the best physical condition. Second is the return of Hummel. This can be accomplished if his health perm its his travelling under the existing very trying conditions. 34 \"Last evening,\" continued Flick, \"I spent with Capt ain Arthur D. Reed, Property Control Officer of the Military Government . He is the custodian of all businesses, a highly intelligent and earnest ma n of about forty.... Captain Reed is in accord with any personal efforts I have and can make on behalf of my company. He is sold on ... Fellinger, and has gi ven him a position of trust with his section, that of trustee of former Nazi bu sinesses. He also uses Fellinger as counsillor on IBM policy. 35 \"After my conversation with Captain Reed,\" Flick we nt on, \"it was agreed that I might communicate with Fellinger thro ugh him, and, if you so desire, I will forward any directions in this manne r until more normal com- munications are restored. Also through Reed, I was able to locate Major An- drew Haensel from whom you may have heard through [ Watson aide] Jack Kenney. I spent the morning with Haensel and am for warding some reports on this meeting as enclosures hereto. . . . Haensel has done an outstanding job of cooperation insofar as he can do so within e xisting regulations. The same is true of Captain Reed. I made arrangements w ith Haensel, to forward any communications to the present executives of the company here in Berlin, with a copy to Reed and vice versa. Thus, any corre spondence will be en- tirely on the up and up, and will by the same token be subject to military screening. The three of us will keep in touch with one another as stated.\" 36 Flick also addressed the difficulty of significant cash accounts in Ger- many that were blocked and therefore unavailable to defray the day-to-day needs of Dehomag. \"The company [Dehomag] needs cash,\" wrote Flick. \"R eed, Haensel, and Fellinger have all indicated that a matter of one h undred fifty thousand marks will keep the breath of life in the organization fo r a period of three months when it might be possible to operate more normally once again. If I get to Hamburg I will endeavor to do something about this if it can be done within existing regulations. Haensel, who is quite thoroug hly informed, holds out little hope that any capital in Berlin will be avai lable for a long time.\" 37 Flick concluded his long report to Watson, \"In the meanwhile I would appreciate hearing from you on the matter of how mu ch interest any of the"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"IBMers should continue to take in European business , etc. Until I hear fur- ther, I shall endeavor to pick up any and a l l data that may be of interest to you. It is of course obvious that much of the data may already be available to you or may duplicate information, which you have ha d for some time. There is no way of avoiding this, and it is only with the hope that what is gathered may be of help to the home office, that we in the f ield, are gathering with considerable difficulty, the material which is bein g sent in.\" 38 Watson did not appreciate the help. In IBM's view, the IBM Soldiers rendered invaluable service to the company. But he saw Flick's helpfulness trying to restore Hummel as unwanted interference. Watson had no intention of re-empowering the leaders of the Dehomag revolt, and any manager with a claim to a percentage on profits. Watson possesse d the ability to send a sin- gle letter from his office that would reach direcdy into the bombed-out sec- tors of Berlin. He wanted Flick silenced and remove d. He ordered Chauncey to Washington with a letter. S EPTEMBER 20, 1945 The Honorable William L. Clayton Assistant Secretary of State Washington D.C. Dear Mr. Secretary, I have just received a letter from Lt. Col. Lawrenc e G. Flick, who is on leave of absence from the International Business Machines Corpo- ration, in the Military Service, a photostatic copy of which I enclose. In the first and fourth paragraphs he refers to restor ing Mr. Karl Hummel to the Management. We do not want any of our IBM pe ople in the Mili- tary Service discussing anything of this kind with any of our German representatives because we do not know how many of the German employees we will take back into the organization, when our business is re-instated in Germany. We would like to have Colonel Flick notified of thi s, and I am asking you to advise Mr. H. K. Chauncey, who presents this letter, as to how the matter can be handled, consistent, of course, w ith the policies and wishes of the Military authorities in charge. Sincerely, Thomas J. Watson President 39 "},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"The response was swift. Several days l a t e r , Assista nt Secretary of State Clayton wrote to his counterpart at the Pentagon.

On November 27, 1945, Hilldring repo rted back to the State Department, \"Lt. Colonel Flick is being returned to the United States for retirement from the Army. Therefore, General Clay h as recommended that no further action is necessary.\" 42 Dehomag, the Berlin company so integral to the Hitl er war machine, was never treated as an enemy entity. It was welcom ed back as a precious American interest and still under the control of Th omas J. Watson. RECAPTURING DEHOMAG was a long, involved process that began within days of Germany's surrender. On May 18, 1945, IBM N Y sent three letters to the State Department's War Problems Division. Th e first explained that IBM owned a company called Dehomag that installed e quipment around Germany. Certainly, much of that machinery had been moved in the last days of the Third Reich. IBM wanted State Department hel p in locating every one of those devices. \"From January 1937,\" IBM's le tter claimed, \"Dehomag has failed to give us detailed information of insta llations in Germany. . . . Consequently, we do not know the exact location of the machines. We attach a list of the places in which at one time we knew m achines were located.\" A two-column list itemized eighty-eight German citi es and towns where Holleriths had been installed. The statement about not knowing addresses since 1937 was made in spite of IBM's assistance in preparing the Civil Guide, which included up-to-date addresses as of 1944 on n umerous key Hollerith installations. 43 The company's second letter to the War Problems Div ision included the addresses of two residential properties that had be en managed by IBM's tax attorney. IBM wanted the rents. \"He has, no doubt, accumulated a substan- tial amount of money for the rentals of the buildin gs.\" 44 A third letter just reminded the State Department t hat by immediately establishing communications with Dehomag, a list of the precise locations of shifted equipment could be obtained. 45 Shortly thereafter, the State Department sent instr uctions to American foreign service officers in Germany and Austria to \"extend such protection as may be possible to the property.\" 46 On October 24, 1945, Chauncey returned triumphandy to Germany to"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"reclaim Dehomag. The setting was quite different f rom his last visit. Then, in 1941, he never knew from moment to moment whether h e would run afoul of the Nazi Party. Now he was in the company of vic tors. 47 Chauncey's journey began in liberated France, where the U.S. Army assigned Capt. Philip Kober as his escort. The two men traveled to Frankfurt where another escort, Capt. Philip Hayter, joined t hem. Their first stop was IBM's Frankfurt office. As he entered the property, Chauncey was abundantly cautious in his demeanor. General Eisenhower had de creed strict \"non-frat- ernization,\" forbidding such common courtesies as s haking hands with Ger- mans, engaging in friendly conversation, or visitin g in German homes. IBM could adapt to any geo-political setting. When the rule was banquets and social graces, the company could summon up corporat e celebrations and par- take of festive extravangazas at a moment's notice. Now under strictures of cold communication, IBM could exhibit regulation ch illiness. In that vein, Chauncey visibly asked his military escorts' permis sion before conversing with anyone, spoke only in the presence of officers , and even declined to look at papers unless cleared in advance. After fir st obtaining permission to speak to IBM's Frankfurt manager, Chauncey, in a di spassionate, formal tone, requested a complete list of financial data on the office. Little more was dis- cussed with the Dehomag manager. 48 From Frankfurt, the trio traveled the next day to S tuttgart, hoping to in- spect the vital Dehomag factory in nearby Sindelfin gen. In Stuttgart, Chaun- cey first met with Maj. J. M. Teasdale, the U.S. of ficer in charge of Dehomag and other commercial property in the area. When Cha uncey asked if there was any existing procedure for an American company to regain control of its property, Teasdale replied that none yet existed. B ut if it would help, Teas- dale offered to make Chauncey the custodian. He exp lained that if Chauncey accepted the custodianship, he would be functioning not in IBM's interest as much as in the army's interest. Chauncey was not re ceptive, feeling, \"I think it unwise for any IBM man to be in charge.\" In any event, Teasdale declared he would not permit any German to continue working for an American firm against the American company's wishes. That include d Dehomag. 49 What's more, there was business to be done. The U.S . military needed more Hollerith alphabetizers in France and Germany. The army was prepared to sign leases for equipment. Teasdale declared he was more than willing to permit Dehomag to fill those orders. He then assign ed a field investigator, Private Schufert, to accompany Chauncey and his esc orts to Sindelfingen. 50 Dehomag's Sindelfingen plant was undamaged. No bomb s had struck. Chauncey and the three military men were met by Osk ar Hoermann. Taut and"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"unfriendly, Chauncey informed Hoermann be would not converse with him except with the permission and w i t h i n earshot of \"t he Army people... accom- panying me.\" Having been authorized to speak, Chaun cey stated that the army wished IBM to recover the Holleriths the German Arm y had removed from France. Hoermann replied, as Chauncey noted in his report, that \"Dehomag had little information, since the taking of the mac hines was done by the Ger- man Army and not with the cooperation of Dehomag.\" Ironically, few knew more about those transferred machines than Hoermann . Hoermann, of course, was deputy Nazi custodian of CEC, the key Dehomag e ngineering manager in charge of French equipment, and aware of page af ter page of CEC b i l l i n g demands on the Reich. What's more, Hoermann functio ned as the intermedi- ary between CEC and the MB as Fellinger negotiated and finalized all 308 machine-specific lease contracts. Chauncey did not correct Hoermann. 51 Instead, Chauncey merely went on to the next order of business. The U.S. Army, said Chauncey, was anxious to obtain Ger man-made alphabetizes, especially the advanced D11-A. Hoermann replied tha t although five such machines were placed into production, only one was fully assembled and in operation—the machine used at Dachau. Then in the p resence of two special military escorts and an army field investigator, Ch auncey inspected the Dachau machine. It was partially dismanded. He noticed tha t the device, which fea- tured a rotary printing mechanism, seemed larger th an the Model 405 Ameri- can alphabetizer. Hoermann asserted that the Dachau machine never worked as well as it should. Captains Kober and Hayter als o examined the device. In reporting back to IBM NY about the D11-A, Chauncey wrote, \"This machine was used at Dachau, but was sent to the Dehomag at Sindelfingen through the cooperation of Mr. Hendricks.\" Sergeant Hendric ks was a U.S. Army in- dustry liaison that headed up \"a special installati on\" at Bad Nauheim. 52 As Chauncey turned to leave, the gregarious Hoerman n tried to ask several questions about his IBM friends. He had ope nly corresponded with them during the war years. But Chauncey stiffly cut him off, asserting that no personal conversation or other pleasantries could b e exchanged. Hoermann demurred. 53 That day, the group returned to Frankfurt where the y met with Hen- dricks, who had just returned from Berlin. Hendrick s had inspected the dam- aged Lichterfelde facility, and was carrying an env elope for IBM containing a full report from the German staff there. Lieutenant Colonel Flick had con- veyed the report to Hendricks. In the awkward momen t that followed, Hen- dricks pulled the envelope out of his pocket, but C hauncey declined to actually accept it. Instead, Chauncey immediately h anded the envelope—"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"without looking inside, to Captain Kober standing n ext to him. Kober, who read German, skimmed the reports and then granted p ermission for Chauncey to review it as well. Chauncey did so, but quickly realized the reports \"convey no information not previously known .\" 54 Hendricks told Chauncey some additional information about Dehomag managers. Rottke's imprisonment by the Russians for Nazi connections was considered a lost cause because Mrs. Rottke was kno wn for pronounced Nazi views. But Hummel was back. After Hummel was releas ed from the Allied prison at Bad Kreuznach, Hendricks saw no harm in t ransporting him to Stuttgart in a truck. 55 Even though Watson had wanted Hummel excised, he had already been restored to the company. On October 30, 1945, Chauncey returned under escort to Paris to con- tinue the methodical process of reclaiming the Germ an subsidiary. He con- tinued to petition various offices of the occupying authorities in Europe and the State Department in Washington. Even though a c omplete policy on resumption of corporate control had not yet been de fined, as soon as any ad hoc element of the policy was espoused, IBM was rea dy to swiftly act on it. During late summer and fall 1945, the bureaucratic barriers gradually began to crumble. 56 The Berlin and Sindelfingen operations were adminis tered as two dis- tinct entities. During the summer, the military had initially appointed Dehomag Manager H. Beckmann as custodian of the Berlin oper ation. But he was ex- tremely inefficient and depressed over Germany's fo rtunes. His son had been killed in the war. His wife had her teeth knocked o ut during an altercation with Russian soldiers. Chauncey called Beckmann \"a broken man.\" What's more, he was on bad terms with Fellinger. Beckmann ordered guards to stop Fellinger at the gate. Fellinger complained. So the military replaced Beckmann with another Dehomag manager, W Cimbal, who was mor e to Fellinger's lik- ing. Whoever was appointed to run Dehomag was depen dent upon Fellinger for transitional help. After all, Fellinger had bee n effectively running the sub- sidiaries since 1943. Nonetheless, occupation autho rities, overlooking Fellin- ger's Nazi Party connections, designated him a spec ial advisor to Cimbal. 57 Although IBM had not regained control of Dehomag, t he company was now allowed to resume its normal operations as quic kly as possible. Consid- erable monies were still frozen in bank accounts. A n August 1945 review re- ported that salaries had not been paid since the fa ll of Berlin. So Cimbal rallied Lichterfelde's resources, cut expenses and salaries, and re-established monthly leasing patterns. To earn extra cash, toys were produced from scrap metal. Soon Lichterfelde's tabulators were rattling again. Punch cards were"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"rolling off the presses. By September 1945, more th an 320 prior German in- stallations were in operation, including Holleriths at public utilities, insur- ance companies, and railroads. One plant filling ca rd orders for the French and U.S. armies was already at 75 percent capacity; it had produced 58 mil- lion cards from September to November. A military o rder for 17 million was waiting to be produced. Cimbal was compelled to see k IBM NY permission to order $12,000 in additional machine tools to res tart the manufacturing program. 58 Before the end of the year, Chauncey would be able to report in a letter to Watson, \"Cimbal has done a good job. The territo ry under him is operat- ing on a cash basis profit. You know already of the ir manufacture of toy9 from scrap and novelties from American Army discard ed tin cans. The rentals, however, remain the backbone of the revenu e.\" 59 In August 1945, the military instructed Fellinger t o prepare comprehen- sive reports on his command of IBM subsidiaries in Germany, Norway, France, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, as well as his knowledge in other territories. In addition to a resume of activ ities, Fellinger was required to forecast the prospects for each division. Fellin ger addressed some reports direcdy to Watson. But most of the surveys were for mally submitted to American military government for IBM's review. 60 These extensive country- by-country summaries, backed up by financial data, contained most of the information IBM NY needed to resume control. Shortly after the submission, an unidentified branc h of the military arrested Fellinger. 61 That was end of his involvement with IBM. On December 3, 1945, the American military governme nt in Stuttgart passed a message for Chauncey through an army offic e in Paris. Firm policies were still unresolved on restoring American propert y. But Chauncey could again travel to Germany to resume discussions. 62 The next day, December 4, Chauncey and another IBM officer, Mr. Warrin, flew from Paris to an airport near Frankfur t. The late connecting flight to Berlin was canceled due to poor weather. They tried again in the morning, but the weather was unimproved. While wait ing in Frankfurt, they again called on Captain Hayter, who asked IBM to pr epare whatever contract it deemed appropriate to allow the military to begi n the widespread leasing of needed Dehomag machines and secure repair servic es for mobile U.S. machines in the area. 63 Chauncey was happy to comply. With the weather still difficult, Chauncey and Warr in resorted to an overnight train. Purchasing tickets at the last min ute, they were required to travel all the way to Berlin in regular seats inste ad of first-class berths. Once"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"in Berlin, they sought out Major Curry at the local Property Control Office. He authorized Chauncey to f i n a l l y inspect the Licht erfelde facility. No escort would be necessary and any useful discussion could take place. 64 When Chauncey and Warrin arrived at Lichterfelde, D ecember 6, 1945, an American flag was flying atop the Dehomag factor y roof. They were met by Cimbal and a delegation of Dehomag employees. Fr om the outset, Chauncey announced, as before, no \"friendly discuss ion\" could take place, but only an exchange of business information requir ed by IBM NY. 65 The next day, Chauncey received a message to come t o Cimbal's home to speak to Major Curry. That evening, Chauncey and Warrin arrived at Cim- bal's home as requested, and met Curry. But when th ey walked in a bit fur- ther, they saw a beautifully set dinner table. It w as nothing like the grandiose banquets IBM had staged during the war, but Mrs. Ci mbal had spent some time trying to be hospitable with the little they h ad. Abruptly, Chauncey stopped and harshly demanded that no party-like atm osphere could ensue. Adhering to a strict non-fraternization ethic, he i nsisted only business in a business-like setting could be discussed. 66 Just then, Lieutenant Colonel Flick entered the din ing room. In a few days, Flick was due to return home. But for now he was still in authority. He berated both Chauncey and Warrin for their unfri endly attitude toward the Cimbals. At that, Chauncey retorted: had he kno wn he was being invited to a party, he would have refused. The two IBM men turned around and abrupdy left. 67 After first checking with several ranking occupatio n officers, Chauncey softened his manner with Cimbal. In subsequent cont acts, he was able to ex- tract the key information about Dehomag's Berlin op eration, including its customer list, financial condition, a review of blo cked bank accounts, and the prospects for profitable continuation. Eventually, he learned that the Sindel- fingen plant alone had produced some $3.07 million in cards and equipment during the war years. One site alone, Plant II, ave raged 39 million cards per month. At the cessation of hostilities, the Berlin factory controlled about 1,000 total installations, representing as many as 6,000 machines, worth $2.34 mil- lion. Some 1,314 punches, verifiers, sorters, and t abulators were damaged at user sites, representing an approximate loss to IBM of $1.61 million. 68 Dehomag machines were located throughout what had b een known as the Greater Reich and adjacent occupied territories . In Poland: 444 punches and verifiers, 144 sorters, 124 tabulators, and 74 auxiliary machines. In Aus- tria: 447 punches and verifiers, 117 sorters, 91 ta bulators, and 53 auxiliary machines. In Czechoslovakia: 108 punches and verifi ers, 37 sorters, 26 tabu-"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"lators, and 17 auxiliary machines. All tolled, some 2,348 Holleriths were identified for recovery. 69 Chauncey sought out IBM attorney Heinrich Albert. A lbert was now functioning as custodian for Ford Motor Company's o peration in Berlin. Although many of the records relating to Dehomag we re lost, Albert was able to sign enough affidavits and certificates to document that IBM NY was in fact the lawful owner of Dehomag and all its Hol leriths. 70 Machine by machine, office by office, IBM NY began recouping the proceeds of Dehomag's service to the Third Reich. I n doing so, the utmost care was taken to walk the thin green line between conquest and commerce. Chauncey summarized his own conduct in a report to New York. Uppermost in his mind, was the \"desire that neither I nor IBM should be in any way criticized.\" 71 Chauncey was completely successful. Endless additio nal meetings ensued with the many transient bureaucratic faces of what was known as OMGUS (Office of the Military Governor-U.S.), as well as its counterparts in the Russian occupying administration. IBM was cautious, persist ent, and consistendy above reproach. This perception was indispensable because with the horror of 6 mil- lion murdered Jews, and perhaps an equal number of other Europeans, as well as billions of dollars, francs, and crowns in plunder and devastation, war crime trials were being organized. Reparations from the German commercial sector were being readied. IBM very much wanted to be excluded. MILITARY LAW NO . 52 was a problem. Article I stated: \"All property in occupied territo ry is subject to seizure of possession or tide of management, supervision or otherwise, which is owned or controlled in any way by: (a) The German R eich or any sub divi- sion or agency thereof; (b) any Governments or nati onals at war with the United Nations at anytime since September 1, 1939; (c) the outlawed NSDAP ... or its agencies; (d) persons held by Military G overnment under deten- tion.\" Dehomag qualified on all accounts. It was co ntrolled by known Nazis, Heidinger and Rottke, who also owned 10 percent of the shares. Rottke and Hummel had been arrested for their Nazi affiliation s. The company's Board of Directors since 1941 was completely Nazified. As part of the war machin- ery, Dehomag was under the jurisdiction of the Masc hinelles Berichtwesen, a wartime agency. 72 Chauncey had reviewed a summary of Military Law No. 52 and other Allied decrees as early as May 21, 1945. 73 IBM sought to be carved out of"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"the sphere of culpability and absorbed into the app aratus of victory. It wanted r e s t i t u t i o n for its war-damaged property, no t to become a candidate for reparations. IBM did not want to join the roste r of all those deemed part of what was termed \"Nazi conspiracy and aggression. \" Fortunately for IBM, there seemed to be a concerted effort to keep Watso n and the company out of the reparations discourse. On October 16, when Assistant Secretary of State Cl ayton first wrote to the Pentagon about the troublesome Lieutenant Colon el Flick and Dehomag, the third paragraph originally referred to the issu e of potential reparations. \"As you know,\" Clayton initially asserted, \"this Go vernment's policy towards German reparations, external assets, and combines i s not fully implemented and it is my belief that for these and other reason s it is undesirable at this time to foster or support the restoration of privat e business relationships.\" But a State Department policy review of the propose d draft objected to the paragraph. \"Attached is a redraft version of the Cl ayton-Hilldring letter con- cerning the activities of Lt. Colonel Flick,\" wrote \"Walt Rostow. \"As you will note, I have simply removed the offending paragraph .\" A large X was drawn across the draft, and a shorter version mailed. 74 On Chauncey's first post-war visit to occupied Stut tgart, in October 1945, Major Teasdale indicated that all the corpora te enterprises in the heav- ily industrial Sindelfingen area were slated to be liquidated for reparations. Chauncey's report back to New York confirmed, \"He [ Major Teasdale] stated that all of the property in the American zone belon gs to the American govern- ment for reparations, and that if and when property owned by an American was turned over to him, it would reduce the reparat ion claim of the United States and consequendy the reparation claim of the American owner.\" 75 On his second trip, Chauncey arranged for a persona l visit to Deputy Military Governor Clay's office where he was introd uced to General Clay's assistant, Gen. William Draper. Draper, a friend of Watson's, headed up OMGUS' Economic Branch. Draper, in turn, introduced Chauncey to Col. John A. Allen, the man in charge of the Restitution Branch. Chauncey argued IBM's case \"that the American viewpoint would be th e restoration of Ameri- can-owned concerns to their owners, and that it wou ld not be . . . that such companies would be used for general reparations, as has been proposed.\" Chauncey was told that no decision had yet been for mulated. 76 IBM's view held that even if their machinery and co rporate acumen had helped organize and optimize the Third Reich's aggr ession, they should be held exempt—ipso facto—by virtue of its American ow nership. The company contended that its Nazi payments were protected rev enues."},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"However, the prevailing thought among the Allies an d those who demanded justice was that all in government and the private sector who helped Hitler destroy Europe and commit genocide sh ould be held account- able in war crimes. Their war gains and economic wh erewithal were not sacrosanct. Rather, they should be sacrificed as re parations to the victims— nations and individuals both. Whether dressed in ja ckboots and swastikas, or suit and tie, accountability was demanded. Indeed, the world understood that corporate collusion was the keystone to Hitler 's terror. Businessmen who cooperated with Hitler were considered to be war cr iminals or \"accessories to war crimes.\" 77 OMGUS established a Division of Investigation of Ca rtels and External Assets to identify those responsible for the financ ing and corporate support of Nazi Germany. By November 1, 1945, twenty-one ma jor bankers were arrested for their role in helping German rearmamen t and the plunder of occupied nations. Twenty more bankers were targeted . The financial institu- tions identified included Germany's most respected: Deutsche Bank, Dresd- ner Bank, and Commerzbank. 78 German magnates from the steel, finance, automotive , and chemical industries were also arrested and sent to the Nurem berg dock. Names such as Krupp, Thyssen, and Flick became synonymous with corporate war crimi- nality. Even companies with American ownership or a ffiliation were spot- lighted. For example Roehm & Haas of Darmstadt was investigated. The firm, which manufactured Plexiglas bulletproof materials in Germany, was affili- ated with its American-owned counterpart in Philade lphia. Each of the cor- porate twins was half-owned by German and American citizens. The New York Times reported, \"Files located in Darmstadt re veal the history of the joint efforts of the German Roehm & Haas and the Am erican Roehm & Haas to nullify the action of the Alien Property Custodi an and restore the German interest in the American firm.\" 79 By January 5, 1946, hundreds of German factories we re slated to be sold to Americans to effect reparations. These fact ories covered a range of in- dustry from entrenched armament firms, such as the Borgward torpedo plant at Bremen, to Norddeutsche Dernierwerke's factory n umber 4 at Rothebeck, which manufactured simple household utensils and be ds. 80 They were sold both because they represented economic assets of th e German people to be liquidated in war culpability, and because they wer e war vendors. Within another week, OMGUS had destroyed or liquida ted half of I.G. Farben's forty-two German plants. Two dozen of its directors and cor- porate managers were indicted on five war crimes. O ne count specified \"the"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"planning, preparation, initiation and waging of war s and invasions of other countries.\" A second identified \"crimes against hum anity through participat- ing in the enslavement and deportation for slave la bor of civilians.\" A third count accused the executives of \"participation in a common plan or conspir- acy to commit crimes against peace.\" Ten of the def endants were acquitted. The remainder were found guilty and sentenced to va rying terms in prison. 81 By fall 1946, the Allies had selected 658 German pl ants to be liquidated for reparations: 157 in the American zone, 444 in t he British zone, and 57 in the French zone. Only half of the firms were from t he war industry. Russia had already received 15,500 tons of commercial deli veries as part of its repa- rations levy. 82 In Belgium, prosecutors tried industrialists for co mmercial cooperation with the Reich. Defendants included a textile compa ny executive, as well as financiers. All revenues received from Nazi Germany were confiscated; prison sentences ranged from four to eight years. N ewspapers reported the Belgian court's declaration that the executives had embarked upon a \"two- way gamble designed to pay rich dividends either wa y—if Hitler won the war or lost it.\" 83 Justice Robert H. Jackson, chief Nuremberg prosecut or, told Armed Forces Radio that he feared that while German indus trialists were \"one of the chief causes of the war,\" most would never be b rought to justice. Jack- son's fellow prosecutors felt the number of defenda nts would simply be too large to pragmatically try in the first wave of Nur emberg Trials. The other Allied prosecutors suggested that perhaps businessm en could be indicted later. \"I feared failure to include them,\" said Jac kson, \"would mean they never would be tried. Time only will tell which was right.\" 84 Indeed, the trial process was slowed by the necessi ty of translating all documents, exhibits, and testimony into several lan guages of the war crime tribunal: French, Russian, German, and English. Jus tice Jackson turned to a newly invented process called \"simultaneous transla tion.\" One company reviewed all the evidence and translated it not onl y for real time usage at the trial proceedings, but for posterity. That company was International Business Machines. It made the final translated record of al l evidence back and forth from French, Russian, German, Polish, and English. Watson offered to under- take the massive evidence handling free of charge. 85 Many wealthy men stood in the dock at Nuremberg. Pu blishers, finan- ciers, bankers, and industrialists were summoned to account for their com- merce. Hjalmar Schacht himself, former president of the Reichsbank and out"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"of power for years although ultimately acquitted, w as forced to explain his involvement at the bar of justice. 86 But it was a far different story for IBM. It seemed to be immune from the debate itself. Every bloodstain and barracks bl ueprint in the camps was examined, catalogued, and probed. Machines such as Dachau's D11-A, inspected by Chauncey, and those at Auschwitz, Buch enwald, Westerbork, and at the Warsaw Ghetto, were simply recovered and resorbed into the IBM asset list. They would be deployed another day, ano ther way, for another client. No answers or explanations would be provide d. Questions about Hitler's Holleriths were never even raised. IBM WAS MORE than important to the Allies. It was vital. The Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) was the Allied high command in Europe under General Eis enhower. SHAEF had established a classified statistical analysis offic e in Bad Nauheim, which in sum- mer 1945 was serving the United States Strategic Bo mbing Survey (USSBS). Roosevelt had established the Bombing Survey in Nov ember 1944 to evaluate the devastating effects of Allied bombing on German y. This was to include the effects of civilian morale and whether bombs ha rdened the national will to fight, or collapsed it. 87 The Bad Nauheim site was completely dependent upon Hollerith machines and Dehomag operators for its numerous cal culations of bomb destruction and predictions of the resulting social disruption. The so-called Morale Division, staffed with a platoon of social s cientists, psychologists, and economists relied upon the machines to quantify pub lic reaction to severe bombing. Regular debriefing of civilians and experi enced Gestapo agents regarding the dimensions of political dissension, a s well as survey question- naires, were all reduced to researchable punch card data. 88 The USSBS was denied nothing. When its officers ask ed for one Holle- rith, eight sets were flown overnight from the Unit ed States to London, along with the staff needed to operate them; from London, the units were rushed to Bad Nauheim. \"When another USSBS statistical off ice at Jena needed to be evacuated before being absorbed into the Russian zo ne, a convoy of trucks was immediately provided to transfer all the punch cards, machines, and Ger- man technicians in a single move. 89 The man who made the Holleriths run at Bad Nauheim was Sergeant Hendricks. Hendricks was the same man who transferr ed the D-11A from Dachau to Dehomag's Sindelfingen plant. He was also the man who drove"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"Hummel from his prison release to Stuttgart. In Bad Nauheim, Hendricks had the knowledge and expertise to convert the prio r Ho l l e r i t h installation of a former Reich industry association into a pure USS BS operation. Hendricks made sure a continuous stream of army questionnaire s on economic capacity were methodically processed by a range of industrie s in occupied Germany. In this way, the Allies could assess the ability of German industry to recover from the massive bombing it had endured. The system was identical to that employed by the MB when it monitored industrial out put during the Nazi era. Hendricks even used the same forms. 90 On July 30, 1945, a group from the Planning and Int elligence Branch of SHAEFs Economic Division, led by a Brigadier Genera l, visited the Bad Nauheim facility. Three days later, the Brigadier G eneral reported on his visit and Hendricks' indispensable value. \"[T]he party wa s shown round by Sgt. Hendricks,\" the General wrote, \"in civilian life an employee of the Interna- tional Business Machines Company, who are the paten tees of the Hollerith system. Sgt. Hendricks has supervised a number of i nstallations on behalf of his firm, and is obviously a competent technician i n this particular field.\" At Bad Nauheim, the General wrote, Sergeant Hendricks was supervising about sixty \"carefully screened German personnel\" operati ng fourteen sorters, two tabulators, and a host of punchers and verifiers. H endricks told the tour group, the report noted, \"There was practically no limit to the information ob- tainable through the Hollerith system, provided the right questions were asked at the outset.\" In the General's original report, t he words were underlined. 91 The August 2, 1945, tour report noted that Hendrick s was scheduled to complete the USSBS's last economic surveys on Augus t 4. Then the unit's job in Germany would be finished. The USSBS was sch eduled to leave the facility on August 15, the note explained. 92 From its inception, a stated mission of the USSBS w as to apply all bombing impact information compiled in Germany to A merica's air war against Japan. On August 6, a U.S. bomber dropped a n atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Three days later, Nagasaki was bombed. U SSBS statistical analy- ses and predictions of economic and social ruinatio n had been part of the decision-making process. On August 15, President Ha rry Truman instructed the USSBS to begin evaluating the effects of Americ a's atomic bombing of Japan. Anticipating the order, the statistic team h ad already departed Bad Nauheim. They left all their Hollerith equipment be hind. 93 As the best-equipped punch card center in occupied Germany, Sergeant Hendricks assured that with the USSBS gone, the Bad Nauheim location could serve all industrial data needs in the American zon e. Sergeant Hendricks"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"added that a similar data facility could be erected for the British zone. For th e i r part, the Russians in their zone were already utilizing the experienced staff and IBM machinery of the Reich Statistical Of fice in Berlin. 94 There was no need for the American and British to have anythi ng less. But industrial statistics were only the beginning. When occupying au- thorities needed a census of all Germans in the ter ritories, they knew whom to call. Dehomag stepped forward. The company's cen sus experts simply took its existing census tabulation regimens and made ce rtain adjustments for Allied requirements. Some of the column headings were adju sted slightly, but little else. Columns 1-6: unchanged. Column 7: Family Stat us. Column 8: Religion. Column 9: Mother Tongue. Column 10: National Descen t (or Ethnicity). Col- umn 11: Nationality. At one point in the preparatio ns an American officer complained that some of the German column headings requesting ethnicity were \"of Nazi memory and implying a racial idea whi ch was most undesir- able.\" Eventually, however, American objections sub sided. 95 The Russians permitted the Reich Statistical Office , controlled in their zone, to help Dehomag implement the project. The fo ur powers agreed that completed census forms would be destroyed after two years—but only after the individual information was transferred to punch cards. For Dehomag, the 1946 census of occupation was a project organized q uickly and economi- cally. People counting was what they did best. The questions remained the same. Only the client name changed. By 1947, it was time to change the subsidiary's nam e as well. On July 4, 1947, IBM's Foreign Trade Vice President J. T. Wils on wrote to Watson, \"Apparently now is a good time to change the name o f the company and to discontinue the name 'Hollerith.' I have, therefore , given instructions to start the necessary proceedings to call it 'IBM Germany.' 96 As Germany was emerging from its occupation, Dehoma g was edging back to IBM NY's dominion. The company had received permission to under- take various contractual agreements with Dehomag. B ut only upon formal decontrol would IBM NY regain genuine custody of it s German operation. In the meantime, Dehomag's financial success was im pressive. By the end of 1946, it had emerged from a bombed and dissected Ge rmany with a valua- tion of more than RM 56.6 million and a gross profi t of RM 7.5 million. 97 A key toward regaining total control was fortifying the argument that Dehomag was not a German company, but an American-o wned enterprise. On November 14, 1947, custodian Karl Hummel filed p apers with OMGUS and German financial authorities averring that the token German shares in Dehomag that he, Rottke and Heidinger owned were no t genuine stock own-"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"ership. \"We cannot understand how our relationship with our parent can be subject to Law No. 56. . . . While a minority inter est exists in Germany, such minority interest was granted as an inducement to t he managers of the com- pany; but they are not shareholders in the general sense of the term, because they are not free to sell their shares, but can sel l them only to the company and only for their book value. They were retaining the share only during their holding a leading position in the company. On ly one remains today. Mr. Heidinger died in 1944 and Mr. Rottke is report ed to have died in a Rus- sian camp.\" 98 Ironically, the one remaining shareholder was Humm el himself. Before the end of 1947, IBM would finally receive a Treasury License to repurchase the stock of Rottke, Heidinger, and H ummel, thus regaining 100 percent ownership of its German unit. Ownership still did not convey control. It took two years of additional bureaucrat ic wrangling before IBM could legally change Dehomag's name to IBM Deutschl and. That happened in April 1949.\" In the years that followed, IBM's worldwide stature became even more of a beacon to the cause of progress. It adopted a corporate motto: \"The Solutions Company.\" Whatever the impossible task, I BM technology could find a solution. The men who headed up the IBM ente rprise in Nazi Europe and America became revered giants within the corpor ation's global commu- nity. Chauncey became chairman of the IBM World Tra de Corporation, and (he European subsidiary managers were rewarded for their loyalty with top jobs. Their exploits during the Nazi era were lioni zed with amazing specific- ity in a promotional book entitled The History of C omputing in Europe, pub- lished in 1967 by IBM itself. However, an internal IBM review decided to immediately withdraw the book from the market. It i s no longer available in any publicly accessible library anywhere in the wor ld. Eventually, after ceaseless efforts, IBM NY regaine d control of its Ger- man subsidiary. The name had been changed, the mone y regained, the machines recovered, the record clear. For IBM the w ar was over. But for the descendants of 6 million Jews and milli ons of other Euro- peans, the war would never be over. It would haunt them and people of con- science forever. After decades of documentation by the best minds, the most studied among them would confess that they never re ally understood the Holocaust process. Why did it happen? How could it happen? How were they selected? How did the Nazis get the names? They alw ays had the names.

Former IBM em ployees, the families of principal players, and survivors of Wor ld War II emerged to offer eyewitness testimony, personal documents f rom the period, and memoirs. What's more, archivists and historians began assem- bling previously overlooked documents and materials . None of it contradicted, diminished, or mitigated the infor mation that launched the book.

Much of it reinforced the need to encourage research throug hout the world, to persist in connecting the dots. GERMANY Information about numerous German concentration cam ps came to light. In Berlin, during a historians' panel at the Jewish Community Center, I was approached by an enthusiastic Georgia Peet-Tanover, a Bulgarian imprisoned for years during the Nazi re gime. I had actu- ally spoken to her by telephone several times durin g my research, but at last we were able to meet. Peet, who speaks perfect English and maintains an impressive vitality, recalled her days as a young"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"girl in the Ravensbruck concentration camp. When sh e became quite ill, the camp doctor re-assigned her to \"easy work.\" That wo rk involved manual \"sorting of cards with holes punched in them.\" Ther e was no Hollerith machine in her unit, just cards filed in wooden box es. Peet, as she calls her- self, had no idea what the cards were called or wha t their purpose was other than \"something to do with prisoner assignments.\" 1 \"Nor did I care,\" she told me. \"I was just trying t o stay alive.\" Not until Peet and I first spoke at the onset of my research did she understand that the punch cards were Hollerith cards produced by IBM. O nly then did she make the connection to the prisoner designations she was instructed to sort. 2 The Ravensbruck cards Peet and others sorted were r egularly couriered to a central processing bank for concentration camp labor, the Zentral Institut, on Friedrichstrasse in Berlin. Ironically , after the war, Peet settled in a quiet Berlin residential neighborhood on Friedrichs trasse. It was only after this book's research revealed the location of the p rocessing center that Peet realized her pleasant apartment was in the very sam e building complex that housed the Zentral Institut. In Dachau, the Hollerith installation was far large r than first realized. IBM and the Holocaust has documented that in most c amps the Hollerith Department, or Abteilung Hollerith, was ensconced i n the Arbeitseinsatz, that is, the Labor Assignment Office, generally just an ordinary barracks. But after publication I learned that at Dachau, two dozen Hol lerith machines were kept in a special two-story reinforced-concrete str ucture known as \"the Hollerith Bunker.\" Dachau memorial archives have di scovered a photo of the fortified edifice. The archives also include a 1948 report by former Dachau survivors reconstructing various work detachments a nd the names of their supervisors at the camp. The report listed fifty le ading slave labor battalions by the approximate number of prisoners, as well as the kapos and German officers in charge. The list includes the Political Department: 10 prisoners; Arbeitseinsatz: 10 prisoners; Sewing Department: 18 0 prisoners; but the Hollerith Bunker utilized 300 prisoners. The 1948 n umbers are a personal estimate by the survivor group. However, by any mea sure, the Hollerith operation would have been one of the largest stricd y administrative groups in Dachau. 3 Unlike many structures, the pillbox-like Hollerith building survived the Allied bombardment of Germany, and still stands tod ay just outside what remains of the main gate of the camp. Local police continue to refer to the concrete cube by its original name, the Hollerith B unker. 4 With so many machines needing monthly repair and ongoing mainten ance, and with mil-"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"lions of job-specific punch cards required Dehomag technicians were undoubtedly stationed in Dacha u almost continuously . In Buchenwald, where reinforced bunkers had not yet been built, the inherent nature of information technology allowed t he Hollerith system to survive Allied bombardment. No one is sure when Buc henwald's Hollerith Department was inaugurated, but the camp's Hollerit h group was dubbed Kommando 68. 5 Allied bombing raids in August 1944 destroyed sever al buildings at liuchenwald, including the provisional Hollerith of fice. On September 23, Nazi bureaucrats, probably in Berlin, wrote to camp officers asking when the Hollerith files would be restored. Buchenwald's labor placement leader, SS Captain Albert Schwartz, reassured that the card files could be repro- duced quickly. \"[T]he Hollerith file burned complet ely,\" Schwartz answered, \". . . But because prisoners' cards for Buchenwald concentration camp had already been created, a copy is available in the fi le of the Arbeitseinsatzfuhrer [labor placement leader]. We are currendy investiga ting just how many cards are missing . . . about 8,500 cards will have to be tediously reconstructed.\" 6 Captain Schwartz added, \"As labor assignment leader , I myself have the greatest interest in the reconstitution of the card file as soon as possible. In the meantime, I have found a provisional solution u sing data gathered solely for labor assignments, for which an auxiliary card file was created. However, this contains only number, name and occupation as w ell as the current labor brigade assignment. This auxiliary card file is als o constandy needed in order to enter occupations and changes.\" To safeguard fut ure operations, Captain Schwartz explained, \"It is planned that the Holleri th card department be given a separate barracks as a workspace. However, the promised building supplies have not yet arrived.\" 7 Nonetheless, Buchenwald's Hollerith operation conti nued at quite a pace, according to documents just discovered in the camp's archives by Buchenwald's tenacious historian Harry Stein. These documents reveal the almost daily fluctuations in the number of inmates working in the Hollerith unit. On August 18, 1944, just as the Allied bombin g raids started, thirty- three prisoners worked in Abteilung Hollerith; thei r names were handwritten in a two-column roster with Prisoner Fanczak 55/559 99 being the last entry. Beneath Fanczak's name, Prisoners 34/21813 and 56/4 2723 were listed as too sick for work. 8 Five days later, on August 23, the Abteilung Holler ith workforce increased. Scribbled tallies began with fifty prisoners, then subtracted two unavailable for work, creating a new total of forty-eight. But later three new prisoners"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"were added to the detachment - Inmates Susic 40/444 16, Muller 34/21756, and Cielecki 15/3988—diese marked on scraps of depa rtmental notes.

By August 27 , the Hollerith Depart- ment's roster of fifty had been reduced by half whe n twenty-five prisoners from Buchenwald's notorious Little Camp, probably J ewish, had become un- available, most likely due to illness or death. By the end of the month, a re- stored total of forty-eight was again reduced by il lness or death in the Litde Camp to a new work contingent of forty prisoners. 9 On November 17, 1944, the Abteilung Hollerith at Ra vensbruck concen- tration camp sent the Abteilung Hollerith at Buchen wald a group of Hollerith- codable paper prisoner identification forms and a H ollerith transfer list concerning five women transferred to Work Camp Tauc ha on November 6. The cover letter also complained that Buchenwald's Hollerith cards had not yet been received for hundreds of prisoners transfe rred to Ravensbriick in prior weeks. The list also mentioned 244 prisoners moved from Work Camp Torgau on October 5; plus 169 prisoners moved from Work Camp Leipzig, 128 prisoners from Work Camp Altenburg, and 64 pris oners from Work Camp Taucha—all on October 13; as well as six priso ners from Work Camp Leipzig on October 30; and finally, five from Work Camp Taucha on Novem- ber 5. \"We again request that these file cards be s ent as quickly as possible,\" chastised Ravensbriick, \"since they are urgendy nee ded for new transfers.\" 10 On January 25, 1945, the SS Economics Administratio n—the Oranienburg-based agency that operated all camps—di spatched a ten-page Hollerith list of slave laborers deployed in mines at Buchenwald, asking the camp to annotate each miner's current location and status. 11 Prisoners servicing the Abteilung Hollerith at Buch enwald regularly came and went, but the card sorting continued almost unt il liberation. In fact, four- teen prisoners were still laboring in the departmen t on February 2, 1945. By then, Prisoner Muller 34/21756, who was added less than six months earlier, had \"exited.\" Thirteen men still remained hard at w ork on February 13, 1945. 12 On April 11, 1945, Buchenwald was overrun by Allie d troops. The clock above the concentration camp gate was permane ntly stopped at 3:15 P . M ., the moment of liberation. By then, no more card sor ting was possible. New documents and accounts have surfaced at other c oncentration camp memorial archives, some of them obtained from previously unex- ploited records in recently opened Russian archives . For example, weekly \"Change Reports\" were newly discovered in Russia by Sachsenhausen archivist Winfried Meyer. These included 1944 Chang e Reports from Gross-"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"Rosen, Hollerith-coded 5, and Sachsenhausen, Holler ith-coded II. These weekly lists of camp-by-camp work assignment change s were typed or hand- written on large codable paper forms, each column o f the form preprinted with its corresponding Hollerith column number. Inm ate Hollerith numbers were to be punched into column 22, work assignments in column 23, birth dates into column 5, gender into column 6. Other co lumns recorded work skills, such as carpentry, mechanics, or unskilled labor. Two narrow columns on the form confirmed card issuance upon entering t he camp and again when transferring out. Each paper form featured a b ox at the bottom preprinted on the left mit H-Liste vgl, indicating \"compared to Hollerith List,\" and gepruft for \"punch card verified,\" and both wer e initialed by the Holle- rith operator. 13 Generally, handwritten status notations were penned in German under the entries. One bears the note \"all changes in ass ignments of numbers below reported in the Hollerith cards.\" Another sho ws the notation Karten im Lochsaal to indicate \"cards in punching hall.\" 14 A Lochsaal, or \"punching hall\" was a large Hollerith operation generally involving more than a dozen punchers and often as many as four hundred, as well as the sorters, tabulators, verifiers, multipliers, and printing tabulators to process the output. Thou- sands of Change Forms from concentration camps acro ss Europe were received and processed each week by the Hollerith u nit at Oranienburg, allowing the SS to efficiently execute its \"Extermi nation by Labor\" program. More information also surfaced about IBM president Thomas J. Watson's involvement in Germany. A former IBM employee, now in New York State, discovered a pamphlet in his basement and sent me a copy. It was the com- memorative program of a luncheon held in Watson's h onor just before Watson received Hitler's medal during the 1937 Berlin Inte rnational Chamber of Com- merce festivities. The program includes a picture o f Watson surrounded by grateful Hitler Youth, and the text of toasts by Na zi finance wizard Hjalmar Schacht appealing to Watson to help stop the anti-N azi boycott. 15 Perhaps the most astonishing moment of my postbook travels was in Munich, after a historians' symposium. A long line formed at my book-sign- ing table. Two distinguished-looking men finally pr esented their books for autographing. One said, \"Make mine out to Willy Hei dinger, Jr.\" He was the Dehomag chairman's grandson. He and his cousin both congratulated the book for honestly retelling the story of their gran dfather's involvement with IBM. The next morning, the Heidingers and I enjoyed a long, delightful breakfast at my hotel. They declared their view tha t Watson engineered the outright theft of their family's 10 percent of Deho mag, now known as IBM"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"Germany. Immediately after the war, they recalled, Watson's representatives accompanied by American army officials, drove out t o their home near Munich and then pressured the family into signing a way their stock. Pressur- ing Nazi businessmen was not difficult in devastate d and occupied Germany. Today, the IBM shares the Heidinger family once con trolled are worth many millions of dollars. The Heidingers also insisted m y book conservatively understated Watson's true sympathies for Hitler and his true knowledge of the events in Germany. 16 In addition, smoking-gun information was found upon re-examining internal IBM correspondence. On July 4, 1945, just weeks after the war ended, the manager of IBM's Czech subsidiary, Dr. G eorg Schneider, wrote a letter to Thomas J. Watson in New York, summarizing his loyal efforts on behalf of the New York office. \"I beg to give you m y report about the IBM office in Prague, Czechoslovakia. . . . All the inter ests of the IBM were in good hands. The $-rentals were transferred to the a ccount of IBM in Geneva, after begin [sic] of war with U.S. All $-rentals mu st be converted at the rate of exchange of K25.02 Crowns = $1 and stored on the blocked account of IBM in Prague.\" 17 Schneider added that he met Watson's emissary Harri son K. Chauncey in Berlin, after the U.S. entered the war, to obtai n IBM NY's permission to disguise German machines as Czech. \"I made in 1942, \" Schneider reminded Watson, \"with Mr. Chauncey, visiting Berlin, an agr eement and so we were authorized to buy machines from the Dehomag and to sell or lend [lease] in our name. From each machine we had to pay a lice nse-tax [royalty] to the IBM.\" 18 FRANCE In Paris, I was contacted by Robert Carmille, the s on of Rene Cannille. He met with my French publisher and I. Robert Carmille revealed an engaging story of his father's long, patriotic service to Fr ance as a counterintelligence agent specializing in statistics and punch card tec hnology. His father went to Germany twice before the war—in 1935 and again in 1 938—to study IBM technology and German war preparations. During thes e visits, the elder Carmille met with Dehomag managers, and visited ins urance companies for Hollerith demonstrations. While in Nazi Berlin, he wrote home with sadness about the deplorable conditions Jews were subjected to under the Third Reich, according to the written record of colleague s. Robert Carmille recalled that his father witnessed Jews being parad ed around the city, wear- ing humiliating signs. 19 "},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"The most gripping moment during the hotel suite mee ting came when Robert Carmille, himself now an elderly although st ill an eminently lucid man, emotionally declared that the French statistic al service did indeed sabo- tage the Jewish tabulations. We asked him how he co uld be so certain? Carmille trembled with tears in his eyes and admitt ed that when he was twenty-two-years old he had been asked by his fathe r to manage the Lyons regional office and that he had personally operated the machines in Toulouse. \"We never punched column eleven!\" Carmill e emotionally declared. \"Never.\" 20 Column eleven contained racial information. The Vichy demographic service's main office was at 10 Rue Archer in Lyons, but the machines themselves were installed a t Cours de Verdun, near the train station, recalled the younger Carmille. S eventeen regional punch card offices were established. A typical installati on might include three tabu- lators, five sorters, one calculator, seven or eigh t verifiers, and twenty or more punchers. In many offices, recalls Carmille, t his equipment was gener- ally 70 percent Bull and 30 percent IBM. However, L yons, Montpellier, Toulouse, and Claremont-Ferrand relied more heavily on Bull, while Mar- seilles and some other offices relied more heavily on Hollerith. 21 For three weeks in 1943, Robert Carmille actually w orked at the CEC agency in Lyons. Of the several dozen CEC staffers he remembers seeing, at least ten were assigned to marketing because IBM co ntinually tried to increase its share of France's Nazi-era punch card business. 22 Carmille then displayed posthumous commendations fo r valor and bravery bestowed on his father by both the Allies a nd the French govern- ment. And he showed us an IBM newsletter published during Nazi occupa- tion for employees of the French subsidiary. The st rictly business publication featured a photo of an IBM commemorative medal depi cting Thomas J. Wat- son's face set against a regal laurel wreath. 23 Later, a contemporary of the younger Carmille's sen t my French pub- lisher a CD-ROM filled with photographs of heretofo re unknown docu- ments. They indicate that the elder Carmille was in direct contact with officials of the Maschinelles Berichtwesen (MB), th e Nazi government punch card agency in Berlin. Lieutenant von Passow of the MB exhorted the elder Carmille to replace the French demographic service' s Bull machines with Dehomag equipment, even as Passow lamented that the German machines were dependent upon \"American money and technology. \" The documents also support Robert Carmille's chronology that his father's service took pains not to extend the professional census to the occupi ed zone, thereby denying the Reich information it needed to complete its pla n to organize slave labor"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"in France. This instruction was reversed once the e lder Carmille was discov- ered and taken to Dachau. But by then, it was too l ate to materially undo Carmille's sabotage. 24 Much more research has yet to be undertaken in Fran ce. Several Frenchmen involved in the statistical service have kept their stories quiet for decades but are now ready to offer the documents an d testimony—long kept secret—to chronicle exacdy what was and was not don e with punch cards during the war. POLAND The largest cache of discoveries involved Poland. I n 1939, after the German invasion, IBM divided up occupied Poland into two c ommercial territories. The first centered in Upper Silesia, in land annexe d by Germany and ser- viced by Dehomag. The second was conducted in the r emainder of occupied Poland, the so-called General Government that encom passed cities such as Krakow and Warsaw. The General Government territory was to be serviced by a newly incorporated IBM Polish subsidiary, know n as Watson Buro- maschinen GmbH, directly controlled by IBM NY. Poli sh survivors and new documents have shed great light on the Hollerith pr esence there. Historical journalist Christian Habbe of Der Spiege l first sent me in- formation regarding the Abteilung Hollerith at the Stutthof concentration camp. The information has been quietly residing on the Polish government memorial's recendy established Polish-language webs ite at www.kki.net.pl/ ~museum. Stutthof was Hollerith-coded 13. In recent years, Stutthof archivist and historian Marek Orski has documented more information about Hollerith than any other camp historian, incl uding those at Auschwitz. Stutthof's Abteilung Hollerith was organized in ear ly August 1944 as de- portations intensified and the camp's population su ddenly grew to 50,000. SS Rottenfuhrer Werner Reiss was ordered to undergo training at a Zentral Institut seminar at the Storkow concentration camp, which maintained some two dozen IBM machines. On August 4, 1944, Reiss to ok the 6:20 P . M . train to Danzig where he connected to the Berlin express at 11:20 P . M ., and then shut- tled to Storkow The next day, his training began. A fter Storkow, he attended additional seminars for \"Hollerith file experts\" at the Zentral Institut main office at Block F, 129 Friedrichstrasse in Berlin. Thereafter, Reiss reported to the SS Economics Administration, Office D II in Ora nienburg, the agency overseeing slave workers and the Extermination by L abor campaign. 25 When Reiss returned to Stutthof, he established the camp's Abteilung Hollerith, assigning a group of Polish prisoners, i ncluding Leszek Zdrojewski,"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"Bronislaw Peplonski, Julian Krawczyk, and Krzysztof Dunin-Wasowicz. The unit began working in the canteen at Block XI. Due to the delay in getting Holleriths, Stutthof did not yet have its own machi ne. So the men just manu- ally filled out the codable paper forms for deliver y to Berlin and elsewhere for machine processing. Eventually some 80,000 pris oners, dating back to the first arrests of September 1, 1939, were entere d into the system. Thou- sands of codable forms, locally referred to as \"Hol lerith Kartei\" (even though they were paper, not punch cards) are preserved in Stutthof's Hollerith archival files. The highest number belonged to Pris oner 99044, who entered the camp on October 27, 1944. The punch cards ident ified nameless prison- ers by their Hollerith codes for scores of needed j ob skills. Duplicates of the professional file were maintained in Berlin. 26 An extraordinary eyewitness is Leszek Zdrojewski, w ho headed up Stutthof's Arbeitseinsatz and interfaced with the c amp's Abteilung Hollerith. In Fall 1944, he was sent to Zentral Institut in Be rlin for Hollerith training. Accompanied by Reiss, Zdrojewski spent two to three days at Zentral Institut, where he saw some twenty sorters and tabulators ser ved by a staff of more than 100 clerks, frantically feeding machines and s earching for specific pro- fessions among the camps' populations. During my presentation at the Jewish Historical Ins titute in Warsaw, I unexpectedly encountered Krzysztof Dunin-Wasowicz, one of the prisoners forced to work in Stutthof's Abteilung Hollerith. D unin-Wasowicz is now a retired historian, who for some time was associated with the Polish Academy of Science and understands the uses of Hollerith. D uring a twenty-minute presentation, he outlined the history of IBM's tech nology at Stutthof. An electrifying moment came when I held up an enlargem ent of the secret Hollerith Camp Codes. I pointed to code 6, Sonderbe handlung, that is \"exter- mination.\" Dunin-Wasowicz acknowledged the codes we re the exact ones the Nazis used at Stutthof, including code 6 for exterm ination in the camp's small but active gas chamber, which murdered some o ne thousand people. 27 Other Polish eyewitnesses also came forward. The ne wspaper Slowo Pol- skie located Leon Krzemieniecki, probably the only man still living who worked in the Hollerith Department of the railroad office that kept tabs on all trains in the General Government, including tho se that sent Jews to their death in Treblinka and Auschwitz. It must be emphas ized that Krzemieniecki did not understand any of the details of the genoci dal train destinations. Indeed his duties required tabulating information o n all trains, from ordi- nary passenger to freight trains. Krzemieniecki's i nterview in the newspaper, and subsequent extensive oral history with me, reve aled that the railway's"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"Hollerith Department in Krakow required a five-room o f f i c e on Pawia Street equipped with fifteen punchers, two sorters, and a tabulator that he recalls was \"bigger than a sofa.\" The high-security office was guarded by armed rail- way police. 28 Fifteen Polish women were employed just to punch th e cards and load the sorters. Three German nationals supervised the railway office, undertak- ing the final tabulations and summary statistics in great secrecy. Handfuls of printouts were reduced to a small envelope of summa ry data, which was then delivered to a secret destination. Truckloads of th e preliminary printouts, which created the secret summaries, were then regul arly burned, along with the spent cards, Krzemieniecki recalls. As a forced laborer, Krzemieniecki was compelled to work as a \"sorter and tabulator\" ten hours per day for two years. He never realized in any way that his work involved the transporation of Jews to gas chambers. \"I only know that this very modern equipment made possible the control of all the railway traffic in the General Government,\" he told the newspaper. Only after IBM and the Holocaust was released did he begin to recall the significance of his work. 29 In 1944, as the Russians advanced, his group loaded the machines onto trucks, which moved the equipment to Dresden. \"I th ink they vanished with- out a trace,\" he added. 30 Krzemieniecki's relatively small group punched in o nly a limited amount of information on the ten-column cards, mainly the number of the train, whether it was a cargo train, whether express or re gular, and the distance traveled. For example, a cargo designation was code d 8. Five-digit kilometer records were punched in as well. No alphabetical ma chines were used, hence all codes had to be memorized. An \"outside technici an,\" who spoke German and Polish and did not work for the railroad, was a lmost constantly on site to keep the machines running. The technician generally undertook major main- tenance on the machines approximately once each mon th. 31 The Pawia Street operation undoubtedly interfaced w ith a much larger and robust Hollerith operation at the Group IV Tran sportation Office else- where in Krakow. This office continuously tabulated details about the length of train lines, number and availability of locomoti ves and freight cars, as well as the amount and type of cargo, and \"the number of persons transported.\" 32 Railway management was among IBM's most diverse and highly devel- oped applications. Typically, destinations were spe cifically preprinted on the IBM cards in order to locate and route boxcars and engines. Accounting cards organized and itemized the freight billing. L ocomotive efficiency stud-"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"les constantly sought to maximize fuel use and typi cally tabulated the exact amount of coal used to haul specific types of freig ht in the boxcars. The tai- lored railroad management programs, the custom-desi gned punch cards printed at IBM's Rymarska Street print shop across from the Warsaw Ghetto, and the leased machines utilized by railways in Pol and were not under the German subsidiary, but the New York-controlled subs idiary in Warsaw, Wat- son Buromaschinen GmbH. \"I knew they were not German machines,\" recalled Kr zemieniecki in the newspaper interview, and in our later discussio n. \"The labels were in English. . . . The person maintaining and repairing the machines spread the diagrams out sometimes. The language of the diagram s of those machines was only in English.\" 33 I asked Krzemieniecki if the machine logos were in German, Polish, or English. He answered \"English. It said 'Business Ma chines'\" I asked, \"Do you mean ''International Business Machines'?\" Krzemieni ecki replied, \"No, 'Watson Business Machines.'\" 34 That was the correct answer. In Poland, IBM NY's new subsidiary operated under the German legal name : Watson Buromaschi- nen. But the Polish machines proudly bore logo tags with the subsidiary's name in English: Watson Business Machines. Among the most dramatic post-book revelations was t he discovery of the massive Hollerith statistical center in Krakow known as the Hollerith Gruppe, staffed by more than 500 punching and tabul ating employees and dozens of machines. Research discovered a previousl y unknown Berlin agency called the Central Office for Foreign Statis tics and Foreign Country Research, which continuously received detailed data from the Statistics Office of the State Secretariat in Krakow. Nazi Hol lerith expert Richard Muller headed the operation in Krakow. 35 Discoveries about this office answered questions about where much of the data for all of Poland was processed. A variety of Hollerith-equipped Nazi offices had be en operating across occupied Poland from the day of invasion on Septemb er 1, 1939. America was not in the war; Watson had not yet returned his medal; and hence he maintained his complete commercial support for the Hitler regime through- out the initial rape of Poland. As part of this str ategic commercial support. IBM NY agreed to a vital installation of machines s o massive it was not called a Hollerith Department, but a Hollerith Gruppe. Thi s vital installation would permit the Nazis to organize the systematic looting and subjugation of Poland, as well as implement other plans for its ci tizens. Just after invasion, Hitler's General Government in Warsaw asked its"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"Regional Planning Department to establish a Central Statistics Office at the shuttered Jagiellonian University in Krakow. By Apr il 1940, the Nazis formed a working group comprised of a single German statis tics expert assisted by former employees of the Polish Statistical Service and other Polish civil ser- vants. This group sifted through some 60,000 printe d volumes of raw infor- mation in the Polish Statistical Service library in \"Warsaw, preparatory to conversion to Hollerith data. The selected informat ion, along with all previ- ously supplied Hollerith machines and staff, were r elocated from Warsaw to the new Nazi agency in Krakow. So large was the ent erprise, the library of raw intelligence to be punched filled two halls. 36 By September 1940, the Reich issued a Decree for St atistics in Poland, creating the new expanded \"Statistics Office.\" With in a few months, the Krakow Statistics Office at 24 Nurnerstrasse subsum ed most other statistical operations in Poland. By late 1941, the Statistics Office employed 420 persons including 16 Germans in 6 distinct groups—Group I: Administration; Group II: Population and Culture; Group III: Food and Agricul ture; Group IV: Eco- nomic Trade and Transportation; Group V: Social Sta tistics; and Group VI: Finance and Tax. A November 30, 1941, Statistics Of fice report explains, \"The Hollerith Gruppe area of operation stretches a cross all subject areas,\" adding that a major expansion plan would see staffi ng rise to 500 persons within a month. 37 The expansion was dependent on more leased machines , spare parts, company technicians, and a continued, guaranteed su pply of millions of additional IBM cards. Because backlogged orders for Hollerith machines re- quired a year or more to deliver, IBM's long-term s upply commitment almost certainly dated to the first days of World War II. Indeed, the Statistics Office report was written just weeks after IBM's European general manager Werner Lier visited Berlin to oversee IBM NY's deployment of machines in Poland and other countries. The Krakow Statistics Office's November 30, 1941 report assured Berlin, \"the installation of the equ ipment necessary for the work of the Hollerith Gruppe has commenced. It is e stimated that the equip- ment will be ready for use by the end of the year, and that training of the prospective employees can begin. The employee desig nated as the leader of this group now participates in a seminar in Berlin to train for this subject area.... Survey material is already in preparation. \" 38 The Statistics Office also assured Berlin that its Hollerith Gruppe would employ equipment more modern than the old IBM machi nery found in most pre-war Polish data agencies, thus allowing the Naz i office to launch a pleth- ora of \"large-scale censuses.\" Everything would be counted—and often. Large"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"scale \"agricultural\" and \"industrial\" censuses had already been undertaken earlier in 1941. A new \"residential census\" was als o planned. \"But the most important and complex census, t h e population and oc cupational census, has been in preparation since the beginning of the year ,\" the report specified. 39 In addition to special censuses, the report enumera ted a long list of \"continuous statistical surveys,\" including those f or population and culture, domestic migration, infectious disease, and cause o f death. Moreover, regular food and agriculture surveys were \"coupled with sum mary surveys of the population and ethnic groups.\" 40 Tabulating food supplies against ethnic numbers allowed the Nazis to ration caloric intake as they subjected the Jew- ish community to progressive starvation. The Statistics Office's November 30, 1941 report co ncludes with the statement \"Our work is just beginning to bear fruit .\" 41 Much more information has come to light on IBM in o ther countries, and will be incorporated into future editions. Despite a highly publicized, months-long public sea rch throughout the world, in which many stepped forward to offer new m aterials, not a single document was uncovered anywhere in any country indi cating that IBM, either in New York or Europe, ever moderated its st rategic alliance with the Third Reich. Nor did IBM, in the face of continuous media requests after this hook's release, offer any documents or evidence to explain its conduct. Instead, the company issued an official statement: \"IBM does not have much information about this period,\" and declined to com ment."},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"REVELATION AND R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y The Publication of the Hardcover Edition of IBM AND THE HOLOCAUST ON FEBRUARY 12, 2001, IBM AND THE HOLOCAUST WAS simultaneously released in nine languages and d istributed in forty countries. Nine of the world's most prestigious pub lishers worked arduously, time zone by time zone, to ensure that the em- bargoed news broke worldwide at approximately the s ame hour. Doing so meant foregoing the customary months of ad vance cata- logue sales and store placement. But announcing the findings cor- rectly and responsibly was the number-one priority. Our collective hope was to make certain that the explosive story d id not leak in sensationalist or exaggerated snippets, but was dis closed in a com- plete historical context. Equally important, I personally feared that vital d ocuments yet to be reviewed might be further obstructed, or might even disappear. When the news finally broke, the result was a profo und Holo- caust revelation that shook countries and instituti ons, as well as scholars and other individuals. In many ways they a re still shaking. So am I. Here is the story behind that upheaval. Much has been written about the book's secrecy. Ind eed, the book was not made public until February 12, 2001. B ut more than a thousand people in numerous countries were involv ed in its crea- tion. There was no other way to achieve the level o f precision and"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"review required for such a project, and to ensure t he book's message would not be exaggerated or misconstrued. I began sharing information with others two years b efore publication. About a hundred researchers, historians, and volunt eers searched the files of some fifty archives and research libraries in seven countries. Throughout the actual writing in 2000, some thirty-five world-clas s Holocaust historians and other experts reviewed my work, chapter by chapter, as the text rolled off the word processor. Actually, I had invited nearly doub le that number of review- ers. No scholar was off limits, but there was a con dition: Each reviewer had to agree to read every page in order, no skipping a round. Hence, this would be no quick weekend skim, but a protracted, line-by -line effort. For example, noted historian Gerhard Hirschfeld, president of th e International Commit- tee for the History of the Second \"World War, took six months to finish his methodical review. In this way, each scholar would absorb the complete story in context, regardless of specialty. We refused to rush anyone. Not all I con- tacted had the ability or inclination to invest so much time. But several dozen did (see the Acknowledgments). Scores of marginal n otations were made, and many consultations ensued. Virtually all sugges tions and corrections were adopted. Then the revised text was resubmitted over and over again until approved by each reviewer. Thus, IBM and the Holocaust became an extraordinary collaborative effort of international Holocaust and technology expertise. My finished manuscript went to some of the finest e ditors and transla- tors in the book world, located on three continents , nearly all boasting a thick portfolio of Holocaust publishing credentials . The publishers then commenced their own painstaking reviews, positing n umerous questions and requests for written clarifications. Original Frenc h, German, or Dutch docu- ments were shipped to each foreign publisher for in dependent translation and verification. Most publishers requested that th eir own local Holocaust specialists read the text as well. Because IBM and the Holocaust was a global release, it was imperative that my manuscript be bu lletproof not only in America, but also in the academic corridors of Engl and, Germany, France, Holland, Italy, Brazil, Argentina, Poland, and the several dozen other coun- tries in which it appeared. This imposed a welcome duty to harmonize with local experts on the most subtle points. For exampl e, Auschwitz historian Franciszek Piper, who meticulously read every page, requested numerous minute changes from a strictly Polish perspective; among them was that we not refer to concentration camps in Poland, but rat her occupied Poland. We adopted all his corrections in as many editions as possible."},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"Then came the lawyers. My manuscript needed to pass the scrutiny of attorneys throughout the Americas and Europe, each applying the most con- servative standards prevalent in his country. In so me nations, such as Eng- land, known for its tough publishing laws, the test was more than rigorous. Factual backup—often sentence by sentence—was sough t on point after point. It was provided, and all were satisfied. In one case, I carted sixteen boxes of documentation into a lawyer's conference r oom for a two-day hair- splitting challenge. I welcomed all such challenges . My files are arranged so that any sentence in the text can be completely documented at the thirty- second pull of a folder. Defensive documentation ha s always been my rule. Finally, the world's major media was invited to lau nch its own indepen- dent pre-publication review. The most respected net works, newspapers, and magazines in the world assigned their most senior h istorical journalists known for Holocaust coverage and expertise. For wee ks before publication, and in some cases months, a caravan of hardened and skeptical print and broadcast journalists trekked to my basement outsid e Washington, D.C., por- ing over my files, examining and filming documents, interviewing experts, and questioning me. Concomitantly, many launched th eir own investigations in Europe, carefully scouring local archives and qu estioning experts to inde- pendently verify my information. The long roster of distinguished media included Der Spiegel and Stern in Germany; the Sunday Times in England; L'Express and Le Monde in France; Newsweek, The Washington Post, and Reform Judaism i n the United States; Algemeen Dagblad in Holland; and many more. The med ia group also included major TV networks in Germany, France, Poland, Holla nd, the United States, and numerous other countries. Each network dispatch ed its most accom- plished historical journalists with acknowledged Ho locaust expertise. Der Spiegel independently discovered the Abteilung Hollerith in Stutthof. Algemeen Dagblad, in Amsterdam, flew in its senior Auschwitz expert, Theo Gerritse. ZDF-TV in Germany dispatched Ralf Piechow iak, noted for work on other respected Holocaust documentaries. NBC in Ame rica spent almost a year before publication flying film crews and resea rchers to concentration camps, archives, and eyewitnesses to meticulously v erify the book, deploying knowledgeable producers who had previously investig ated Chase Manhattan Bank's connection to the Third Reich. While the media was reviewing the manuscript and fi les, numerous Jewish leaders in America and Europe were sent copi es as well. Under no circumstances would I launch a book of this nature without briefing the Jewish and Holocaust survivor leadership. Many of t hese leaders cope with"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"complex Holocaust issues every day; they are among the best informed on the topic, and offer an indispensable perspective. For example, David Saper- stein, director of the Religious Action Center of R eform Judaism, displayed an uncanny eye for detail and contributed a number of precious pre-publication suggestions. By February 2001, hundreds of copies of the origina l and revised man- uscripts were circulating, and as many as a thousan d people on three conti- nents had access to the information. Archivists and scholars throughout the world were anxiously anticipating the release. Scor es of journalists and their research staffs in a dozen countries were filming, inquiring, and interviewing. Throughout it all, the publishers, my agent, and I were determined to release the information in as responsible a fashion as poss ible. Each publisher con- tractually agreed to avoid any insensitive or sensa tionalist marketing, and we extracted similar pledges from as many of the other media as possible. I even listed four terms that my publishers were forbidden to use: exclusive, secret, unknown, and first-time. Historical context, proper explanations, and a non- sensationalist ap- proach continued to guide our every move. Jewish le aders scheduled several historical presentations to answer community questi ons immediately after publication. The most important one would be held j ust days after the book's release at Temple Beth Ami outside Washington, D.C. It was sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League, the Braun Holocaust Cen ter, the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, and a consortium o f other organizations and synagogues. I would speak, and openly show docu ments for anyone to examine. Academic presentations would also be offer ed by two of the world's leading scholars on the period and topic: R obert Wolfe, retired chief of captured German documents for the National Archi ves and arguably the world's leading expert on Nazi documentation, and W illiam Seltzer, the fore- most expert on the use of population statistics and Hollerith technology to persecute minorities during the Holocaust. Hundreds of people were invited in advance to a Holocaust presentation days before the book's publication, and none of them knew the specifics. C-SPAN would b roadcast the session. A website was constructed at www.edwinblack.com to offer sample excerpts and other historian and leadership comment ary. A single sedate and carefully worded press release was readied by the p ublishers worldwide. More than two dozen scholars and Jewish leaders had unanimously written public letters of endorsement to be released simult aneously. There is a point here. IBM and the Holocaust was no t—and could not— be created in isolation. I invited an unprecedented level of pre-publication"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"review and authentication by scores of independent sources all at my unwavering insistence. It was expensive, cumbersome , tedious, and fre- quently a nerve-wracking, twenty-four-hours-per-day undertaking for my publishers; my agent, Lynne Rabinoff; my seasoned, original editor at Crown Publishing, Douglas Pepper; and myself. But i n the end, we could all declare that we had exercised every ounce of pruden ce humanly possible— and then some. Books had been pre-positioned in stores worldwide i n unlabeled boxes, with warnings that they could not be opened until February 12, 2001. Then came the leak—it was exactly the type of vague and misleading message we were hoping to avoid. And it was pervasi ve. Far from an errant bookstore, or a reporter jumping the gun—the source of the leak was where 1 always expected: IBM itself. Days before February 12, IBM broadcasted a global e -mail to its more than 300,000 employees, warning that the book would soon be released and that it would evoke \"painful\" topics about IBM's in volvement in the Holo- caust. Copies of the e-mail were circulated to majo r news oudets around the world. That warning was followed by a carefully cra fted statement: \"IBM does not have much information about this period or the operations of Dehomag.\" Then a steady campaign of misinformation began. IBM always knew I was working on this book. In 1999 , after assem- bling very preliminary research, I contacted IBM's corporate archivist Paul Lasewicz for permission to examine the company's ar chives in Somers, New York. I offered to share with the company all my fi ndings so that IBM—and the world—could obtain an accurate portrayal of the corporation's involve- ment in the Holocaust. Lasewicz approved my access but needed permission from IBM public relations manager Ian Colley to sch edule the exact day. After I had spent weeks of waiting, and numerous co nversations with him, Colley still refused to schedule my visit, claiming Lasewicz's archive was \"understaffed,\" in massive disarray after years of neglect, and involved in a time-consuming Internet project. Several prominent Holocaust figures also asked IBM to schedule my access. The importance of the project was stressed, as were the basic themes of identification, confiscation, ghettoization, and even concentration and extermination. The more we inquired, the quieter an d more ambiguous IBM became about its intentions to permit a review. Unb eknownst to me, IBM used this time to scour its New York files. Nor did we know that, many months before, IBM had hired a group of litigation historians who search government archives worldwide for incriminating cor porate links to Nazi"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"Germany, to tackle the company's own 8,400 cubic fe et of files. We knew that IBM had a history, going back to the Hitler era, of moving files from obscure place to obscure place, losing critical documents, purging records, and even destroying files. After several months, I wrote a blunt letter to IBM chairman Louis Gerst- ner, openly sending copies to numerous senior execu tives: \"I and others have repeatedly asked since May of 1999 that I be allowe d into the IBM Archives in New York to conduct my research regarding IBM's role in Nazi Germany and in the Holocaust. Your company has consistently refused to allow me access, indicating the topic of the Holocaust is 'n ot a priority' for IBM. . . . I again repeat my request that IBM stop stonewallin g on this issue and open your archive. I also ask that until that moment com es, you order a halt to any and all purges and/or destruction of Holocaust-era documents. I am writing this letter so there will be no question as to the stonewalling conduct now being displayed by IBM.\" I wrote several more lette rs like that to Gerstner, as did esteemed Holocaust historians and archivists Sy bil Milton and Robert Wolfe, as well as Jewish media editors who were awa re of my work. After stalling for months in the face of continued pressure, IBM suddenly took action by transferring about a thousand pages of their Somers, New York, documents to an academic institution. The doc uments were \"loaned.\" But IBM did not \"lend\" this material to any recogni zed Holocaust or Jewish archive, such as the Holocaust Museum in Washington , D.C., or even the Center for Jewish History in Manhattan. Instead, an IBM public relations manager called the public relations director at New York University, seeking to transfer the documents to NYU's Department of He brew and Judaic Stud- ies, famous for Biblical-era scholarship. Six boxes were abrupdy shipped to the departmental chairman Lawrence Schiffman, an es teemed Dead Sea Scrolls scholar. Schiffman, with no idea what was i n the boxes, innocently stored them in his office closet. For IBM's part, t he company could tell the media it had donated the files to a scholar—even th ough the scholar's exper- tise was in the study of the Dead Sea Scrolls. At the same time, an IBM employee group in Germany had separately agreed to allow me access to their files outside St uttgart. Several years before, IBM Germany had arranged for its Nazi-era f iles to be shunted to an obscure, abandoned IBM warehouse located a forty-fi ve-minute train ride away from Stuttgart. A group of former German emplo yees in the \"IBM Klub\" stored the files in a private Hollerith museu m called the House of Data. I flew to Stuttgart in September 1999 for my scheduled visit. But Col- ley learned of the visit and at the last minute ins tructed the Klub's amateur"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"historian to deny me access. On a gray, rainy after noon, I stood in front of the museum door at the appointed hour, hoping to be let in. But the museum was instructed to shut down that day. Talkin g only into a door intercom, I repeatedly asked, \"What are you hiding? \" A voice responded, \"You must call Ian Colley.\" Later, Colley warned me, \"You won't get access to a ny IBM facility in the world, no IBM archive, no IBM library.\" He also told me the company was getting ready to move the Stuttgart documents t o another location. IBM continued to receive letters of protest. In mid -September and early October 1999, Gerstner and numerous senior managers at IBM received sev- eral of these. Sybil Milton wrote Gerstner, \"As for mer senior historian of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, I am aware of the importance of researching the subject of IBM's involvement with N azi Germany, including but not limited to its Hollerith machines. . . . I un derstand that documents were withdrawn before Mr. Black arrived in Stuttgar t and [others were] transferred to the NYU Department of Hebrew and Jud aic Studies. This appears to be an act of obstruction intended to imp ede access and research. [The] NYU [department] specializes in Biblical arch aeology and pre-twenti- eth century learning and is inappropriate as an arc hival repository for IBM materials; indeed the physical transfer and potenti al disarray of these records seems likely to obstruct further access and researc h. I have known Mr. Black since the early 1980s. His previous studies have fo cused on Holocaust-era finances and Jewish affairs and speak for themselve s. He is a responsible researcher familiar with the subject. He is thoroug h and fair in his analysis and writing.\" She demanded IBM open its archives to me. Robert Wolfe wrote, \"Until 1995, I served with the National Archives for more than a third of a century of service as it s specialist for captured Third Reich, war crimes trial and World War II records. . . . Black's latest project seeks information about IBM's involvement in statis tical work performed for the Third Reich. ... As an archivist of decades of experience, I am taken aback at such a cavalier denial of access to a proj ect of such potential historic, humanitarian and moral significance. As an archivis t and historian, I can as- sure you there is no justification—commercial, hist orical or archival—for hiding this material or obstructing efforts to acce ss it.... The sudden transfer of selected files to the NYU Department of Judaic S tudies, a university de- partment known primarily for Biblical and Medieval studies with little archival capability and devoid of any transmittal papers all owing NYU to show the documents, rather than working with a recognized Ho locaust-oriented institu- tion, suggests obstructive timing to thwart Black's research. This is a familiar"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"tactic for keeping document on the move and hamstri nging them in archival processing.\" Several major Jewish leaders then contacted Profess or Schiffman, indi- cating that the documents in his closet were of gre at significance to the Jew- ish community, and urging him to share them with me . Quickly, Schiffman became the hero of the documents. He immediately se cured legal permission through university attorneys to show them to me. I was given complete access. The selection of the seemingly boring, comp letely unprocessed cor- porate documents IBM had loaned NYU was quite spars e. Virtually all wartime documents were conspicuously missing. But b y adding information from other archives, I was able to assemble the sto ry. Indeed, Schiffman received an advance copy of my manuscript and joine d other scholars in endorsing the book. Schiffman declared, \"Edwin Blac k's IBM and the Holo- caust is a thoroughly researched, meticulously docu mented history of the relationship of a corporate giant and the advanced technology it sold to the Third Reich, its war effort, and its plan to exterm inate the Jews.\" Over the months, I had phoned IBM officials dozens of times, seeking access to documents and explanations of their Hitle r-era actions. I outlined the information discovered in my research with spec ificity so that the com- pany understood the gravity of the implications. Ea ch time, Colley stayed on message, declaring IBM would not discuss the period or my findings. Nor could I have access. At one frustrated and emotiona l point, I asked if Colley would search the archives for a copy of my mother's punch card. He coolly replied, \"I'm not going to get drawn into that ques tion.\" After about one hundred such calls, I simply gave up. IBM would nev er cooperate. Things were quiet at IBM throughout the beginning o f 2000. But in May 2000, IBM was again reminded that my research w as progressing rapidly. An eminent professor who had been helpful and was a ware of my work let slip a comment to reporters in Jerusalem that a boo k would soon be released proving that \"IBM helped Hitler exterminate the Jew s.\" Israeli, German, and Austrian reporters aggressively called Ian Colley, who had by now trans- ferred to Paris, asking what IBM's role was during the Holocaust. Colley answered by saying the company \"knew little about t he German subsidiary.\" After a few days, the isolated radio and newspaper reports ceased. Sometime after that leak, IBM arranged to transfer several l inear meters of its Stuttgart documents to business archives at Hohenheim Univers ity in Germany, where they are being \"inventoried\" and, as of this writin g, are still inaccessible. The documents arrived at Hohenheim just weeks before my book was released. Also in the weeks before publication, reporters beg an contacting IBM"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"public relations manager Carol Makovich and other I BMers, seeking official responses to the specific findings in the book. IBM stuck to its story that the \"Information Company\" had no information about the documents in its own archives, and had transferred some documents to est eemed institutions for study. IBM had known for two years that my book was coming . During those two years, I and others had been asking for access and answers, and during the seven years their logo-emblazoned machine had b een prominendy dis- played at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., prompting enormous speculation, IBM claimed it had never tried to look into its own records and document its own past. When press inquiries made it clear that the book wa s just days away, IBM pre-empted with its own global press release—es sentially, the only official statement it has issued. IBM's statement r eiterated that the company had no information about the period or its own docu ments. The company added the first of a series of well-parsed phrases, and what can only be seen as conscious misinformation. For example, IBM's sta tement declares, \"As with hundreds of foreign-owned companies that did busine ss in Germany at that time, Dehomag came under the control of Nazi author ities prior to and dur- ing World War II.\" But clearly, the public facts are otherwise. Watson received his medal from Hitler in 1937. The war began on September 1, 1939. IBM exercised highly visible minute-to-minute on-site micro-manag ement of its German subsidiary—and indeed all its European subsidiaries —until the summer of 1940 when Watson was pressured into returning the m edal. Until the late fall of 1941, IBM NY ruled the German unit through stalw art European man- agers who were backed up by German and American att orneys. IBM's state- ment was released even as the Sunday Times (London) posted to its website incriminating October 1941 IBM internal corresponde nce with Watson con- firming the fashion in which IBM NY controlled its German, Polish, and Romanian operations two years after the war began. Even after the U.S. entered the war in December 194 1, IBM never lost control of its companies in Nazi-controlled lands. When German custodians, or receivers, took over, virtually all IBM staff an d management remained in place. Only the profits were temporarily blocked as in any receivership. After the war, IBM fought to recover all those Nazi-block ed bank accounts, claim- ing they were legitimate company profits. IBM, through spokeswoman Makovich, remains consciou sly silent about the numerous other European subsidiaries cont rolled during the"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"twelve-year Holocaust directly from New York or thr ough its Geneva office. These include subsidiaries in Switzerland, France, Spain, Poland, Romania, and dozens of other territories. Nor will Makovich make any mention of the Hitler-era documents still held by IBM subsidiaries in Poland, Argentina, France, Italy, Holland, and many other countries. T he corporation has been asked repeatedly, but simply declines to respond an d refers callers to its one and only on-the-record statement. Indeed, as recent ly as September 2001, IBM told an American Jewish Congress regional board member in Dallas that the company had no information on the topic. The details of IBM's obstruction were not included in the original book's introduction. In my view, that would have be en a distraction that IBM would have welcomed. The paramount issue is not IBM 's obstruction in the twenty-first century, but its involvement with the Hitler regime from 1933 to 1945. My personal struggle to obtain this informati on is, in my view, but a tertiary footnote. The public, it seems, has not accepted IBM's vague and parsed words. The book became an immediate New York Times bestsel ler in America, with similar results across Europe and Latin America. In many countries, such as Canada, Ireland, and Brazil, the book achieved the number-one slot. This is meaningful not as a measure of commercial success, but only as a gauge of the world's acceptance of the information. Average people, most of whom had no detailed understanding of the Holocaust or i ts twelve-year chronol- ogy, are now avidly reading the unhappy details. Wo rd of mouth is stronger than any minute on TV or inch of type. Every day I continue to receive emotional emails an d letters from Christians, Jews, and others from all over the worl d, giving thanks for the information in the book and deploring IBM's past in volvement and its con- tinued silence. One gentleman wrote, \"For days now, I have not slept well since reading your book. This is my fourth reading. I am haunted by the image of IBM working with the Nazis to schedule tra ins to gas chambers.\" Not a few are from thankful current or former IBM e mployees who admit that rumors circulated around the company for years. The descendant of one key IBM official mentioned in the book remem bered innocendy play- ing with Nazi punch cards as a child, and wrote, \"Y our book will never leave me. So many hands stained, I am sorry that my famil y name played a major role in what is history's greatest wrong—perished i nnocent people... Thank you for taking the painstaking efforts to uncover b oth of our families' history.\" During my speaking events, the audiences are angry and emotional. These people demand answers from IBM. But answers h ave yet to come."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"Worse, in place of answers, IBM's Makovich offers t ortured tautologies. For example, the told the C-Net Internet news servi ce: \"As far as we know, the nature of the contacts between IBM executives a nd German government officials during the 1930s were similar to those wi th other government officials in other countries and consistent with IB M practices in the various countries in which the company did business during that era.\" More than that, Makovich has quietly plied the medi a with a twelve- page background fax or email of distraction, misinf ormation, unverified information, and negative reviews. As reviewers and reporters on tight dead- lines digest the conflicting information, and weave it into their work, IBM's method has cultivated some confusion. It seems that the most important thing for IBM is not clarity, but confusion about i ts activities. The more con- fusion IBM engenders, the more ambiguous its role m ight become. Fortu- nately, that has generally not been the case. Some 400 public reviews and commentaries by respected historians and reviewers have lauded the book, despite the misinformation in IBM's campaign. Score s of these public reviews have been posted to my website, www.edwinbl ack.com. But it is true that a small number of historians—ab out a dozen—have been unduly defensive. We fully anticipated that so me historians would react this way. After all, 15 million people had seen the machine at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., and no one had yet conn ected the dots. Few even tried. In my introduction, I clearly wrote, \"H istorians should not be defensive about the absence of even a mention [abou t IBM's role in the Holocaust].\" I always understood that the task requ ired a special combina- tion of Holocaust knowledge with an emphasis on Hit ler-era finance, added to information-technology expertise, sifted through the dogged techniques of an investigative reporter. Instead of using the book's revelations as a springboard for additional research, several esteem ed but embarrassed his- torians sought to defensively find excuses to deny its findings. Like Holocaust denial, Hollerith denial requires me ticulous documenta- tion to refute. But in both cases, the sad facts of Hitler's solutions are in- escapable. For example, one elderly, eminent, but h ighly defensive Holocaust historian who had not read the full book opined in a Frankfurter Rundschau interview that Hollerith machines were mainly used for census during the Hitler years, and the ghettos and Jewish organizati ons had no such ma- chines. In his many respected books, this historian had never mentioned the topic, and indeed the gentleman had no grasp on the technology. The news- paper subsequently published my corrections that th e main use was not census—which occurred only once every five or ten y ears in any country, but"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"the customized financial, statistical, railroad, an d inventory management that clicked ceaselessly hour to hour throughout Europe during the Hitler era. Moreover, published Frankfurter Rundschau, the tech nology did not require on-site machines. For example, some 41 million cens us forms from across Germany were trucked into one central office at Ale xanderplatz in Berlin. Many concentration camps operated Hollerith Departm ents with no machines; they simply messenged their punch cards or coded pa per forms to Berlin or Oranienburg for processing. One prominent American business magazine published an ad hominem and vitriolic review by a Reich-era business histor ian who tried his best to defend IBM. The review asserted, \"When data process ors finally appeared at some forced labor camps ... they had little effect on the fates of the inmates.\" It is hard to envision a program named Exterminatio n by Labor that has \"little effect on the fates of the inmates.\" The mi sinformed reviewer then clamored that the SS Race and Settlement Office did not even receive its machines until 1943, as though this marginal agency was somehow vital to the extermination effort. Few know that the obscure SS Race and Setdement Office was a screening service for adoptions and ma rriages by SS officers, which is why it did not receive a machine until 194 3, a point my book makes in two separate chapters. The Race and Setdement Of fice is so marginal, its work is unmentioned in virtually every standard Hol ocaust reference. The reviewer even tried to excuse Watson's collaboratio n, writing, \"Unless Wat- son was prepared to write off his assets in Germany ... he had litde choice but to put the best face on happenings there, or to bite his tongue, and culti- vate good relations with German leaders.\" The review in that business magazine was immediatel y condemned by the Anti-Defamation League as \"morally bankrupt,\" a nd they added that it \"not only distorts the historical facts of the period, b ut virtually argues in favor of commercial collaboration with the Nazis. . . . Mill ions of dispossessed and exterminated Jews, had they known, would have hoped a major American corporation would have foregone the pursuit of thes e profits.\" The business magazine prompdy published my rebuttal, linked it a nd my own website to the archival article on its website, and then ran a sec ond laudatory review, de- claring, \"With exhaustive research, Black makes the case that IBM and Watson conspired with Nazi Germany to help automate the ge nocide of Europe's Jews.\" The turnabout was obvious, but that did not stop IBM from continu- ally distributing the first condemned review—and no t the second—to other reviewers and inquiring historians. Defensive and misinformed conclusions and analysis are one thing, but"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"I was astonished when a few eminent historians publ ished - or tried to publish highly detailed information out of thin air without a single docu- ment to justify it. For example, one esteemed revie wer in a major New York daily wrote with great authority that machines at D achau were only used for payroll, or that they were installed at Buchenwald in August 1944 but then destroyed weeks later. I launched an international effort to locate even one document to support these groundless statements. Th e result was new discov- eries (see the Afterword), which only deepened the original book's findings. Wary of publishing false Holocaust information devo id of any basis in fact, the managing editor of the New York daily asked the boo k review editor and the reviewer to provide documents to support the statem ents. \"When no primary, secondary, or even tertiary documentation was forth coming, the newspaper published my letter stating that the review \"relies on many startling misstate- ments of known historical documentation. Several re searchers have checked records in Germany and America, attempting to verif y . . . [the reviewer's] claims about Hollerith machines. We have been unabl e to locate a single his- torian, survivor, archivist, or editor anywhere who can produce even one Nazi-era document, oral testimony, or memoir to sup port\" the assertions. Soon, other editors learned that eminent credential s were no guarantee of a factual review of IBM's role in the Holocaust. One of the most reliable magazines of Israeli and Jewish affairs ran a revie w by a highly respected Holocaust author, again filled with ad hominem refe rences. This review was filled with numerous errors and distortions, and co ncluded with this state- ment: \"This strange type of pre-publication 'peer r eview,' in which the read- ers are chosen by Black, raises more than a few que stions about the book's reliability. Having spoken to several of them after they had read the book, I found that they all overlapped on one point: that Black took an interesting subject and built it up beyond proportion, probably in order to tell a better story.\" The reviewer's many false statements and er rors were detailed to the magazine's editor. Upon questioning, the historian confirmed to the aston- ished magazine editor that none of my pre-publicati on reviewers were actu- ally contacted. The review was immediately pulled f rom the magazine's website. My letter of correction was published shor tly thereafter and the publication sent me an official letter of thanks. The best-read history journal in England abruptly c ancelled a review submitted by one of Britain's most distinguished Ho locaust historians. That reviewer had asserted this bizarre technologic stat ement: \"The Hollerith cards were inflexible, obviously subject to frequent huma n error, easily torn, and had to be programmed on a time-consuming one-by-one bas is. It is not surprising"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"that the Nazis did not use them on a regular basis in carrying out the Holo- caust.\" Punch cards were printed by the mi l l ions, n ot programmed one by one. At this writing, a prestigious Ivy League history j ournal has promised to intensely scrutinize before publishing a review by an eminent historian of Reich business until numerous complaints of errors can be resolved. Those complaints came to light when the challenged review was faxed to a histor- ical institute just before my speaking engagement t here—months before scheduled publication. A historian in New England i s working on a joint letter with me retracting and correcting his mistaken revi ew in a scholarly journal, which he admits unfortunately relied upon the busin ess weekly's review con- demned by the ADL as a \"distortion of history\" and \"morally bankrupt.\" The New England reviewer, like several others, blindly repeated statements about the SS Race and Setdement Office, not knowing what the agency was. Many other publications have recanted, corrected, or can celled error-filled reviews that engage in Hollerith denial. Although I was astonished by the statements of a fe w historians, my friends in academia simply chuckled. They had seen it many times before. Still, others involved in the study of Holocaust hi story did not find these misstatements humorous. \"Most dismaying to me was t he reaction of some of the Holocaust scholars I had come especially to respect,\" says \"Wolfe, arguably one of the world's most accomplished Holoc aust scholars. He adds, \"Some refused to read the book, others indulged in ad hominem attacks on its author. They are defensive because they were sc ooped. ... I have always assumed that the essence of scholarship is . . . co gent interpretation of the best available sources. Perhaps it is embarrassing that most Holocaust experts (with the notable exception of the late Syb il Milton) missed the role of punch-cards in enabling the Third Reich . . . to e ngage in war crimes such as operating concentration camps where exterminatio n through labor was conducted. Some of the most telling records of the amoral and profitable involvement of IBM with Nazi Germany were in my cus tody for a third of a century, but it took Edwin Black to draw their sign ificance to my attention.\" Ironically, while readying my Afterword, I issued a worldwide call for any corrections of \"fact or fact context\" that coul d be incorporated in the next edition. I asked for any documentation to be a ttached. The notice was repeatedly posted at the most visible Holocaust sit es on the Internet, circu- lated to several dozen university history departmen ts, and I even personally phoned likely critics soliciting corrections. None came. That said, one pre- publication reader did remind me to correct a few m inor errors discovered just before publication of the hardcover involving the number and type of"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"questions on nineteenth-century American consus for ms. We also corrected numerous typos. Other than that, the main chapters of the paperback are vir- tually identical to those of the hardcover. Fortunately, the few isolated instances of Hollerit h denial were margin- alized by most reputable historians and the public. People continued to de- mand accountability. Numerous lawsuits were filed o r threatened against IBM by Jews in America, Poland, and France, and by Gypsies throughout Europe, seeking to open IBM's archives. Ironically, some of these lawsuits were deemed to threaten the final financial reparat ions agreed to by Ger- many. Eventually, rather than endure months and yea rs of additional delay due to any IBM litigation, U.S. and German governme nt officials as well as organizational leaders pressured the plaintiffs' la wyers to desist. The U.S. State Department itself issued a statement announci ng one lawsuit dismissal, asserting, \"The primary remedy sought by the plaint iffs in the IBM case was the opening of IBM's archives in relation to the Wo rld War II period. The United States strongly supports the opening of all archives, public and pri- vate, relating to the Holocaust era in order to fac ilitate further research and encourage greater understanding of the Holocaust an d its historical context.\" Unfortunately, other than the two partial transfers , none of the other archives has yet been opened. Nor did the carefully worded S tate Department state- ment indicate when those IBM archives might be open ed. To date, IBM has never acknowledged or explained it s twelve-year involvement with the Hitler regime. Nor has it apol ogized for its role in the Holocaust or the German war machine. Nor has it ope ned its numerous archives. I firmly believe that the people of IBM t oday are good people, many of them are friends. But IBM has received terr ible advice from its public relations people. IBM should take a lesson f rom its Nazi customers— acknowledge and reveal its activities and move on. Instead, it seems, that IBM is hoping the matter will simply go away. But, the Holocaust will never go away. An entire co mmunity of young researchers is now combing the archives of Europe, Latin America, and the United States. Long after I have moved on to other book projects, new reve- lations about IBM's role in the Holocaust will cont inue to emerge. As I said previously, I have only scratched the surface. The deeper the world digs, the darker and more documented the picture becomes. EDWIN BLACK Washington, D.C.

Although many of t hese works could only raise questions about the larger picture, most of them re presented early attempts to learn the truth. During my research, I benefited from all these preliminary efforts. The first of these is Die restlose Erfassung: Volks zahlen, Identifizieren, Aussondern im Nationalsozialismus, by Gotz Aly and Karl Heinz Roth, published in 1984 as a well-researched study arguing against registration policies in modern Germany. In the process, Aly and Roth traced numerous forms of Nazi registration and statistical abuses, including those undertaken with Hollerith m achines. In the 1990s, there were four more references. When the United States Holo- caust Memorial Museum acquired its Hollerith machin e, its census uses were men- tioned in the museum's 1993 illustrated catalog, Th e World Must Know. Thereafter, three articles appeared in scholarly journals far f rom the Holocaust mainstream. The first was the excellent article \"Locating the Victi m: An Overview of Census-Taking, Tabulation Technology, and Persecution in Nazi Germ any,\" by David Martin Luebke and Sybil Milton, which appeared in the Annals of t he History of Computing, published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engi neers. Three years later, an attempt at rebuttal appeared in the Annals of the History o f Computing authored by Friedrich Kistermann, a retired IBM engineer and tabulator en thusiast; his work was entitled \"Locating the Victims: The Nonrole of Punched Card Technology and Census Work.\" The third article was William Seltzer's landmark wo rk of scholarship entitled \"Population Statistics, the Holocaust, and the Nure mberg Trials\" in the September 1998 edition of Population Development and Review. Seltzer, a former United Nations statistical and census expert, assembled an impress ive list of secondary references to census and registration during the Holocaust. In 1997, Andreas Baumgartner offered a fleeting ref erence to Hollerith in a little known Austrian volume entitled Die vergessenen Frau en von Mauthausen: Die weib- lichen Haftlinge des Konzentrationslagers Mauthause n und ihre Geschichte. During my research, I consulted hundreds of books, articles, monographs, pamphlets, jubilee editions and other secondary mat erials, both in paper form and electronically. I cannot list them all, but the fol lowing identifies some of the more salient items. Adler, Jacques. The Jews of Paris and the Final Sol ution: Communal Response and Internal Conflicts, 1940-1944.
