Holocaust survivors report that at least 700,000, if not as many as three million people primarily of Jewish faith were murdered in the Treblinka camp, located in eastern Poland, between the summers of 1942 and 1943. Various murder weapons are claimed to have been used: mobile or stationary gas chambers; poison gas with delayed or immediate effect; unslaked lime; hot steam; high voltage; machine guns; vacuum chambers; chlorine gas; Zyklon B; diesel exhaust gas. According to the witnesses, the corpses of the victims were fi nally incinerated on pyres as high as a multi-story building without leaving any traces. In the fi rst part of this book, the of fi cial image portrait of Treblinka is subjected to a thorough critique regarding its historical genesis, inner logic, and technical feasibility. The result of this analysis is essentially that the historical picture, which is prescribed by penal law in many European countries, is untenable, because it is nothing more than an uninterrupted chain of absurdities. In the second part of this book, the authors attempt to deter- mine the real function of the Treblinka camp with the help of witness statements, documents, and forensic fi ndings. Through their analysis, they conclude that Treblinka was a transit camp, through which Jews from Warsaw and other areas were led on their way either to occupied Soviet territories in the east or to the Majdanek camp and other labor camps in the area south of Treblinka.

Two of these camps, Auschwitz and Ma jdanek, are supposed to have origi- nally been established as normal concentration camps, but later served as ‘ex- termination camps’ 1 as well, in which the able-bodied Jews were used in forced labor, while those unable to work were gassed. Furthermore, as the of- ficial historical version would have it, there were four ‘pure extermination camps,’ namely Treblinka, Sobibór, Be łż ec, and Che ł mno (Kulmhof), serving the exclusive purpose of annihilating Jews. Except for a handful of ‘labor Jews,’ who were necessary for keeping the camp in operation, all Jews trans- ported there, regardless of age or state of health, were murdered without any record being made of them. Treblinka, Sobibór, and Be łż ec, often designated in the literature as ‘Camps of Operation Reinhardt,’ 2 were located in the east of the General Gouvernement, thus in German-occupied Poland. In these three camps, mass murder was supposedly committed in st ationary gas chambers by means of exhaust gasses from diesel engines. On the other hand, in Che ł mno, situated northwest of Lodz, gas vehicles were supposed to have served as murder weapons. According to the official versi on of history, in all four ‘pure exter- mination camps’ the corpses of the murder ed were initially buried in enor- mous mass graves, but later, when it beca me clear that the military defeat of the German Reich was impending, exhumed and burned in the open air. The claims about mass murder and the disposal of bodies are based entirely and exclusively upon eyewitness testim ony. Documents from these camps are almost completely missing, which the official version of history explains by saying that either the National Socialists did not compile any or – in the case that such did exist – they destroyed them in time in order not to leave behind any proof of their atrocities. For the sa me reason, it is claimed, Treblinka, So- bibór, Be łż ec, and Che ł mno were also totally destroyed before the German re-   1 This English term does not appear in a single German document of the war period. 2 This operation, whose purpose c onsisted, in part, of the conf iscation of Jewish property, owes its name to the State Secretary in the Ministry of Finance, Fritz Reinhardt, and not, as is claimed in most of the official historiograp hy, to Reinhard Heydrich. The basis for this er- ror may lie in the fact that in some documents of the wa r period ‘Reinhard’ (without the t) appears as an alternate way of writing Reinhard t. In reference to this, see Carlo Mattogno, “Sonderbehandlung” ad Auschwitz.

In fact, the visitor finds almost no tangible traces at the sites where these camp once were. Under these circumstances, an historia n, who wishes to check with scien- tific methods the picture of the four ‘ pure extermination camps’ outlined here, sees himself confronting a far more difficult task than a researcher who has set himself the same goal with respect to Auschwitz or Majdanek. The latter can study the documents of the camp administration, which are available in great number; he can examine the quarters – some of them preserved in undamaged condition, others in ruins – which accord ing to the prevailing notion served as gas chambers for killing human beings, to see whether their structure was suited for such a function and whether th e crematoria were capable of turning into ashes the number of bodies claimed. All of these possibilities are denied to the historian of the ‘pure extermination camps.’ The theme of the present study is Treblinka, which was situated not far from the hamlet of the same name, approximately 80 km northeast of Warsaw. Treblinka is without a doubt the best known of the four ‘pure extermination camps;’ in public consciousness, imprinted by media reports, it has become one of the darkest hallmarks of the ‘Holocaust,’ second only to Auschwitz. The Treblinka camp consisted of two camps, Treblinka I and Treblinka II. It is undisputed that Treblinka I served purely as a labor camp. The alleged ‘extermination camp’ bore the designation Treblinka II. This was about 4 km distant from the village of the same name , less than 2 km from the Bug River; it was on the train line running from Ostr ów Mazowiecki to Siedlce, which in- tersected with the more important railway line from Warsaw to Bia ł ystok at the Ma ł kinia Station. All three of the alleged ‘eastern extermination camps’ had been erected in a border zone: Tr eblinka near the border between the General Gouvernement and the Bia ł ystok region, Sobibór not far from that be- tween the General Gouvernement and the Reichskommissariat Ukraine, and Be łż ec between the district of Lublin and the district of Galicia. Treblinka II was situated in an area, which was by no means particularly remote, and it concealed few secrets. Th e train line leading from the village of Treblinka to Siedlce ran at a distance of only 300 meters from the camp, paral- lel to the nearby road; a branch of th is train line led to the camp, and from there to the labor camp Treblinka I. S carcely two kilometers farther on is the village of Wólka Okr ą glik; in the opposite direction, approximately 2 km dis- tant from Treblinka I, were the hamlets of Grady and Poniatowo. 3 If one believes the testimony of eyewitnesses, lively contacts existed be- tween the camp inmates and the local populace, with which a barter trade    3 See Document 1 in Appendix."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Introduction 11 flourished. The Polish peasants “ came with the aim of doing business ;” 4 they brought the prisoners all kinds of food, which they exchanged for gold: 5 “And so it came to pass that baskets filled with rolls, roasted chickens, cheese, butter, cream, and so forth began to arrive each day at Treblinka.” A little more than 2 km away from Tr eblinka II, the Germans had estab- lished the camp Treblinka I, where prisoners were occupied chiefly in the pro- duction of gravel from an enormous pit. The few material traces of Treblinka II, 6 which still existed at the arrival of the Soviets in August 1944, were comple tely removed during the course of the years and no longer exist today. From 1959 until 1964, Treblinka attained its present form: a large sector of the camp ground was embedded in concrete and 17,000 cement blocks reminiscent of grave monuments 7 were erected there. In the center, a gigantic monument of stone 8 was built. At the entrance to the camp, stones proclaim in several languages that here “ more than 800,000 Jews ” were killed between July 1942 and August 1943. 9 Railroad ties of con- crete, flanked by a platform likewise made of concrete, symbolize the train tracks and the train platform of the camp. 10 Otherwise there is nothing for the eye to see than a meadow rimmed by fir trees. 11 By a forest path of some two kilome ters length, one reaches the area where Treblinka I once stood, and along the way one can see the old gravel pit. 12 Shortly before this, one comes upon a sm all cemetery where Polish prisoners rest who died in the labor camp. 13 On an area of the former camp ground, sur- rounded by a woods of fir trees, 14 concrete foundations can be found, ap- proximately 12 m × 60 m in dimension, upon which former camp barracks stood. 15 In Section 3 of Chapter III, the reader will find a detailed description of the area in which Treblinka I and Treblinka II were located. From time to time during the immediate post-war period, there was talk of up to three million people as having been murdered in Treblinka II. 16 The two    4 Eyewitness statement by Samuel Willenberg, in Alexander Donat (ed.), The Death Camp Treblinka , Holocaust Library, New York 1979, p. 192. 5 Eyewitness statement by Abraham Krzepicki, in A.

The site selected was heavily wooded and well hidden from view. A penal camp, known as Treblinka I, had been set up nearby in 1941; Poles and Jews were imprisoned there, working in quarries [20] from which they extracted materials u sed in the construction of fortifications on the German-Soviet border. [21] The extermination camp was established as part of A KTION R EINHARD [Operation Reinhardt] ; work on it began in late May and early June of 1942 and was completed on July 22 of that year. The project was carried out by German firms, using inmates of Treblinka I and Jews brought in from neighboring town s. In addition to the camp struc- tures and gas chambers, a branch railway track, leading from the camp to the nearby railway station, was constr ucted. Huge pits were dug within the camp grounds to be used as mass graves. The camp was laid out in a rectangle 1,312 feet wide by 1,968 feet long (400 x 600 m), [...] . The extermination area, called the ‘upper camp’ by the Germans, was in the southeastern part. Covering an area of 656 by 820 feet (200 x 250 m), it was completely fenced in and se parated from the rest of the camp. In this area was a brick building contai ning three gas chambers, each meas- uring 13 by 13 feet (4 x 4 m). An adjoining shed housed a diesel engine that produced the carbon monoxide fo r the chambers. The gas was intro- duced by way of pipes attached to the ceilings of the gas chambers that ended in what looked like shower heads, to create the impression that the chambers were merely bathhouses. In the bu ilding a hallway led to each of the three gas chambers; inside each , facing the entrance, was a second door through which the dead bodies were removed.

The Germ an version also add itionally and correctly states that the camp was built under the aegis of the “ SS-Zentralbauleitung Warschau .”"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Introduction 13 656 feet (150-200 m) from the gas chambers, to the east of the building, lay the huge trenches in which the bodies were interred. A narrow path, fenced in on each side and camouflaged with tree branches, led from the reception area to the extermination area. It was along this path, nicknamed the ‘pipe,’ or ‘tube’ ( Schlauch ), that the Jews, now naked, were driven to the gas chambers. The camp’s first commander was SS-Ob ersturmführer Imfried Eberl. In August 1942 he was replaced by SS-Obersturmfuhrer Franz S TANGL , the former commander of Sobibór. The German staff, numbering between 20 and 30 SS men, all of whom had taken part in the EUTHANASIA PROGRAM , held the command and administrative positions in the camp. A Ukrainian company consisting of 90 to 120 men served as camp guards and security personnel. They had the tasks of ensuri ng that no Jews would escape and of quashing any attempt at resistance. Some of the Ukrainians were given other duties, including the operation of the gas chambers. Most of them were Soviet prisoners of war who had volunteered to serve the Germans and had been enlisted and trained for their duties at the TRAWNIKI camp. [ 22 ...] Groups of Jewish prisoners were em ployed on construction work as well, which proceeded even while th e extermination process was in opera- tion. They were also kept busy cutting t ree branches in the adjoining woods and using them for camouflage, as well as on other jobs. These prisoners were taken from the incoming transports, put to work for a few days or weeks at the most, and then selected out and killed, their places taken by new arrivals. [...] The Treblinka extermination pro cess was based on experience the Germans had gained in the B E ŁŻ EC and Sobibór camps. An incoming train, generally consisting of fifty to sixty cars (containing a total of six thousand to seven thousand persons), first came to a stop in the Treblinka village railway station. Twenty of the cars were brought into the camp, while the rest waited behind in the station. As each part of a transport was due to en- ter the camp, reinforced Ukrainian guard detachments took up position on the camp railway platform and in th e reception area. When the cars came to a stop, the doors were opened and SS men ordered the Jews to get out. A camp officer then announced to the arrivals that they had come to a transit camp from which they were going to be dispersed to various labor camps; for hygienic reasons, they would now take showers and have their clothes disinfected. Any money and va luables in their possession were to be handed over for safekeeping and would be returned to them after they    22 The Trawniki camp, situated southeast of Lublin, served am ong other purposes as a training site for the concentr ation camp personnel."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 14 had been to the showers. Following th is announcement, the Jews were or- dered into the ‘deportation square.’ At the entrance to the square, th e men were ordered into a barrack on the right and the women and children to the left. This had to be done on the run, with the guards shouting at them , driving them on, and beating them. The women and children were made to enter a barrack on the left side of the square, where they had to undress. Beginning in the fall of 1942, the women’s hair was shorn at this point , behind a partition that was put up for this purpose. From the barrack, they entered, naked, the ‘pipe’ that led to the gas chambers. Women and children were gassed first, while the men were kept in the deportation square, standing naked and waiting until their turn came to enter the ‘pipe.’ Once the victims were locked inside the gas chambers, which had the appearance of shower rooms, the diesel engine was started and the carbon monoxide poured in. In less than thirty min- utes, all had died of asphyxiation. Their bodies were removed and taken to the trenches for burial. [...] A group of two hundred to three hundred, kept apart from the other Jewish prisoners, was employed in th e extermination area, on such tasks as removing the corpses from the gas ch ambers, cleaning the chambers, ex- tracting the victims’ gold teeth, and burying their bodies. When the prac- tice of cremating the bodies was introduced in the spring of 1943, with the aim of removing all traces of the mass murder that had been committed in Treblinka, this group of prisoners was charged with the task. The Germans soon realized-as they previously had at Be łż ec and So- bibór-that the bottleneck in the extermi nation process at Treblinka was the limited capacity of the gas chambers, which covered an area of no more than 57 square yards (48 sq m). It was therefore decided to increase the number of gas chambers, and ten more were built between the end of Au- gust and the beginning of October 1942, with a total area of 383 square yards (320 sq m). They were inside a brick building that had a hallway down the center and five doors on each side, each door leading to a gas chamber. A second door in each cham ber could be opened only from the outside and was used to remove the corpses. The capacity of the new gas chambers was more than sufficient for the entire human load of twenty railway cars at one time. [...] The mass extermination program at Treblinka went into effect on July 23, 1942, and the first transports to reach the camp were made up of Jews from the Warsaw ghetto. Between that date and September 21, 254,000 Jews from Warsaw and 112,000 from ot her places in the Warsaw district were murdered at Treblinka, making a total of 366,000 from the district. From the Radom district 337,000 Jews were murdered, and from the Lub- lin district 35,000, most of them before the winter of 1942-1943. [...] From"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Introduction 15 the Bia ł ystok district, over 107,000 Jews were taken to Treblinka to be killed, most of them betwee n November 1942 and January 1943. Jews from outside Poland were also k illed at Treblinka. From Slovakia, 7,000 Jews who had first been deported to ghettos in the Generalgou- vernement were murdered in the summer and fall of 1942; from T HERE- SIENSTADT , five transports brought 8,000 Jews in the period from October 5 to October 25, 1942. From G REECE , over 4,000 Jews who had first been deported from their homes in T HRACE to Bulgaria came in the latter half of March 1943; and from M ACEDONIA , the part of Yugoslavia that Bulgaria had annexed, 7,000 Jews were murdered in Treblinka at the end of March and the beginning of April 1943. From Salonika, at least one transport of 2,800 Jews came at the end of March 1943. A total of 29,000 Jews from countries other than Poland were murdered at Treblinka. Two thousand G YPSIES as well were among the victims there. The mass extermination program continued until April 1943, after which only a few isolated transports arrived ; the camp had fulfilled its function. In late February and early March of 1943, Heinrich H IMMLER visited Treblinka; following this visit, in a ccordance with his orders, an operation was launched to burn the bodies of the victims. The mass graves were opened and the corpses were taken out, to be consumed by the flames of huge pyres (the ‘roasts’). The bones w ere crushed and, together with the ashes, were reburied in the same gra ves. This burning of corpses in an ef- fort to obliterate traces of the killings was continued until the end of July 1943. On its completion, the camp was shut down, in the fall of 1943. A to- tal of 870,000 people had been murdered there. [...] Several efforts at resistance were made in Treblinka, both by individu- als and by entire transports, [...] At the beginning of 1943, a resistance group was formed among the inmates. [...] When the burning of the bodies was nearing completion and it was clear that both the camp and the prisoners were about to be liquidated, the leaders of the underground resolved th at the uprising must not be post- poned any longer. A date and time were fixed: the afternoon of August 2, 1943. [...] those resistance members who had arms in their hands opened fire at the SS men and set some of the camp buildings on fire. Masses of prisoners now tried to storm the fence and escape from the camp; they were fired at from all the watchtowers and most of them were hit, falling in or near the fence area. Those who succeeded in getting out of the camp were apprehended and shot by add itional German security forces who had been alerted to the scene and, pursuin g the escaped prisoners, combed the surrounding area. Of the approximat ely seven hundred and fifty prisoners who had tried to make their escape, seventy survived to see liberation. Most of the camp struct ures, except for the gas chambers, were made of wood and went up in flames. Of the prisoners who were left, some were"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 16 killed on the spot, while the rest were made to demolish the remaining structures and fences and obliterate th e traces of the activities that had taken place at the camp . When this work was over, these prisoners too were shot. The grounds were plowed under and trees were planted; the camp was turned into a farm, and a Ukrainian peasant family was settled there.” Such is the account of the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust . We have set ourselves the task of subj ecting the portrait of the ‘extermina- tion camp’ of Treblinka as summarized here to a critical examination, and should it not stand up to this examination, of offering an alternative thesis re- garding the real function of the camp. Jürgen Graf is responsible for the In troduction, Chapter 1, Chapter 5, and the Conclusions. Carlo Mattogno bears responsibility for all of the remaining chapters. We express our sincere gratitude to Pr of. Robert Faurisson, Mark Weber, and Dr. Miroslav Dragan for sending im portant material and/or suggestions regarding publications germane to our subject. It was originally planned to include the results of the ground radar investi- gations in this book as carried out at Tr eblinka by Engineer Richard Krege. However, in view of the significance of the subject as well as the expansion of the ground radar investigations to the camps Be łż ec and Auschwitz, it was de- cided to treat this topic in a work of its own, which will be published by the same publishers as this work.

Treblinka in Orthodox ‘Holocaust’-Literature An historian normally makes a sharp distinction between books of facts and novels. In the case of the or thodox literature about Treblinka, i.e. , that supporting the thesis of the mass extermin ation in gas chambers, this distinc- tion is hardly possible: even advocates of the official account of Treblinka who lay claim to scholarship must, in view of the total absence of material and documentary evidence, necessarily rely upon witness testimony, whose value will be dramatically demonstrated to the reader by the following examples. For this reason, we have forsworn any attempt at making such a distinction in our chronological overview of the most important works, which have ap- peared since 1945 and are dedicated entirely or in part to the Treblinka camp. a. Wassili Grossmann We begin with the publication Treblinka Ad (The Hell of Treblinka) of the Soviet-Jewish author Wassili Grossma nn (also spelled Vassili Grossman), which appeared in 1945. The work was not available to us in book form, but rather in the form of a marked-up ma nuscript that we found in a Russian ar- chive. 23 It is not dated, but it emerges from the context that it must have origi- nated at the end of 1944 or beginning of 1945. Already in 1945, a French 24 as well as a Polish 25 version appeared under the titles L’enfer de Treblinka and Piek ł o Treblinki , respectively. Likewise, a Germ an version followed in 1945 in a book, which simultaneously contai ned a report of Konstantin Simonov    23 GARF 7021-115-8, pp. 168-203. 24 V. Grossman, L’enfer de Treblinka , B. Arthaud, Grenoble and Paris 1945. The text is also found in: Le Livre Noir, Textes et témoignages , Ilja Ehrenburg, Vassili Grossman (eds.), Actes Sudes, Arles 1995, pp. 868- 903. The latter book represents the translation of a Russian document, which was prohibited by the Soviet government in 1947 before its planned publi- cation and which was first published in 1993 in Vilnius (Lithuania). 25 Published by Wydawnictwo Lite ratura Polska, Kattowitz 1945."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 20 about Majdanek; 26 a second German edition, reproduced in part by Udo Wal- endy in no. 44 of his Historische Tatsachen , 27 was published in 1946. A comparison of the Russian manuscrip t with the foreign-language transla- tions shows that the latter are somewhat longer. The Russian book version, upon which these translations are based, has thus been expanded with respect to the manuscript in question. Grossmann‘s work represents a classic example of atrocity propaganda. We now cite some excerpts from the German 1945 edition: 26 “In Treblinka there were two camps: the labor camp No. 1, in which prisoners of various nationalities, ab ove all Poles, worked, and camp No. 2, the Jewish camp. Camp No. 1 – the work- or concentr ation camp – was located directly next to the sand pit, at the edge of the forest. It was a camp like the ones, which were established by the hundred s and thousands in the occupied eastern territories by the Gestapo. It began in 1941. As if reduced to one common denominator, the traits of th e German character, grotesquely dis- figured by the frightful distortion mirror of the Hitler regime, are com- bined in it. [p. 27f...] The No. 1 Camp existed from Autumn of 1941 [until] July 23, 1944. It was completely liquidated when the prisoners were already hearing the dull booming of the Soviet artillery. Early in the morning of July 23, the guard unit and the SS people proceeded to the extermination of the camp after they had encouraged themselves with schnapps. By the evening all of the prisoners had been murdered – murdered and buried. The Warsaw cabinetmaker Max Lewit was able to save himself, because he, lying wounded underneath the corpses of hi s comrades, had waited for the dark- ness and had crept into the forest. He to ld how he heard the singing of thirty boys in the pit who stroke up the tune ‘Song of the Fatherland’ be- fore being shot to death; he heard how one of the youngsters yelled: ‘Stalin will revenge us!’ He heard how the Ca mp favorite Leib, who had led the boys, got up once more when he fell do wn into the pit after the volley hit him, and how he asked: ‘Pan [28] Guard, they missed, please once more, Pan Guard, once more!’ [p. 29...] We know the names of the Camp SS people, their characters, idiosyn- crasies, we know the Camp Director van Eipen, a half-Dutch German, who is an insane murderer, an insatiable libertine, a lover of good horses and fast riding jaunts. [...] We know the one-eyed German Swiderski from Odessa, the ‘Master Hammerer,’ who was regarded as the unsurpassable specialist of ‘dry    26 Die Vernichtungslager Maidanek und Treblinka , Stern-Verlag, Vienna 1945. 27 “ Der Fall Treblinka ,” Verlag für Volkstum und Zeitg eschichtsforschung, Vlotho 1990. 28 Polish form of address corresponding to Engl ish “Sir” or “Mister” – Translator’s note."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Chapter I: The Description of Treblinka in Historiography 21 murder,’ because within a few minut es he killed with a hammer fifteen children between the ages of eight an d thirteen years, who had been desig- nated as unfit for labor. We know th e skinny, gypsy-like SS-man Preifi with the nickname ‘the Old Man,’ a taciturn grump. He sought to dissipate his melancholy by sitting behi nd the place where the camp slops were dumped; he stalked the prisoners who snea ked back there to secretly eat potato peels and forced them to open their mout hs and then shot into these widely opened mouths. We know the names of the professional murderers Schwarz and Ledecke. They took delight in shooting at the prisoners returning home in the twilight and murdered twenty of them a day. Thirty, forty men. [p. 29f.] Such was life in this camp, similar to a downsized Majdanek, and it might seem that there could be nothing worse in the world. But the inmates of Camp No. 1 knew quite well that there was something worse, something a hundred times more horrible than their own camp. Three kilometers from the labor camp, the Germans began in May 1942 the construction of the Jewish camp – the human slaughterhouse. [p. 31...] For thirteen months the trains came to Treblinka, each train consisted of sixty cars, and on each car a number was written with chalk: one hun- dred-fifty – one hundred-eighty – two hundred. These figures indicated the number of people who were in the car. Train workers and peasants secretly counted the trains. One peasant from the village of Wulka (the community situated closest to the camp), the si xty-two-year-old Kazimierz Skarzinski, told me that there were days when six trains ran past Wulka alone, over the Siedlce railway, and that there wasn’t one day during the course of these thirteen months that at least one of these trains didn’t come through. But the Siedlce line is just one of the f our train lines which supplied Treblinka. Lucian Cukowa, a railway repair worke r, who the Germans had mobilized for work on the branch line that goes fr om Treblinka to Camp no. 2, re- lates that during his work from June 15, 1942, until August 1943, one to three trains came every day from Treb linka Station to the camp over this secondary line. Every train consisted of sixty cars and in each car were no fewer than one hundred-fifty persons. We have collected dozens of such statements. Even if we reduced by about a factor of two all the numbers mentioned by the witnesses, which were on the trains dispatched to Treb- linka, then the number of people brought to Treblinka within thirteen months nevertheless amounts to approximately three million. [p. 31f.] In the report of this final tragic tr ain, all witnesses mention the atroci- ties of a human-like creature, the SS-man Zepf. He specialized in being the murderer of children. This creature, who had at hi s disposal enormous powers, suddenly grabbed a child from out of the crowd and, after he had swung him through the air like a club, smashed in his skull on the ground or tore him right in two. When I heard of this monster, obviously born of a"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 22 woman, it seemed to me unthinkable and improbable that the acts that were told of him could be true. But when I had personally heard a repeti- tion of these reports from direct eyewitnesses, I saw that they spoke of them as of particular events, which were not unusual for, or inconsistent to, the entire structure of the Hell of Treblin ka, and I believed in the possibility of such a creature. [p. 43...] The dimensions of the first three chambers were only five by five me- ters, which means that each had twen ty-five square meters. Each chamber was one hundred-ninety centimeters high. It had two doors; one admitted the living, the other served for bringi ng out the gassed corpses. This sec- ond door was very wide, approximatel y two-and-a-half meters. The cham- bers were mounted upon a common foundation. These three chambers did not correspond to the productive capac ity demanded by Berlin in assem- bly-line murder. [...] The seven hundred prisoners worked five weeks long on the structure of the new large-scale murder business. When the work had reached its peak, an expert came with his staff from Germany and took care of setting things up. The new chambers, ten in all, were symmetrically arranged on either side of a concrete corridor. [...] The new chambers were each seven by eight meters, or fifty-six square meters in area. The total surface a rea of these ten chambers amounted to five hundred-sixty square meters, and if one added to this the area of the three old chambers, which were put into service at the arrival of small par- ties, then Treblinka had at its disposal a total of usable lethal surface area of six hundred thirty-five square meters. Four hundred-sixty to five hun- dred people were squeezed into one c hamber at a time. When fully loaded, therefore, the ten chambers during one operation annihilated an average of four thousand five hundred people. At their most typical loading, the chambers of the Hell of Treblinka were filled at least two or three times every day (there were days when this happened five times). If we intention- ally reduce the figures, we are able to calculate that, with a usage of only twice per day of just the new cham bers, approximately ten thousand people were murdered in Treblinka on a single day, and about three hundred thousand in a month. Treblinka was operating for thirteen months, day af- ter day, but if we allow even ninety days to be deducted for repairs, idle- ness, untypical transports, there are ten full months of operation. If in one month an average of three hundred thousand people arrive, then within ten months Treblinka exterminated three million people. [p. 47f...] The duty of the writer is to report a terrible truth, and the citizen’s duty as a reader is to learn it. Anyone who turns away, closes his eyes and walks by, desecrates the memory of the murdered. Whoever does not know the whole truth can never grasp agains t what foe, what monstrosity, the great Red Army took up the deadly struggle. [p. 55...]"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Chapter I: The Description of Treblinka in Historiography 23 We entered the camp of Treblinka at the beginning of September [1944] , which was thirteen months after the day of the revolt. For thirteen months the Germans had tried to erase the traces of their work. [...] . And the earth, giving way under one’s feet, is fatty and swollen, as if it had been soaked in a surfeit of linseed oil; the unsolid earth of Treblinka wells up like an eddying sea. This wasteland, surrounded by barbed wire fenc- ing, has consumed more human lives t han entire oceans and seas of the globe since the existence of the human race.” (p. 61f.) In his edifying report Grossmann write s that there were three methods of mass killing: gassing, scalding with hot steam, and suffocation by evacuation of the death chamber by means of vac uum pumps. We shall return to this theme in the following chapter. In a ny case, the second as well as the third murder method very soon took their leave from history; only the gas chambers have remained. Also the number of Treblinka victims, postulated several times by Grossmann as three million, w as dropped at that time as being obvi- ously all too incredible, and in the publ ications that followed writers contented themselves with significantly lower numbers of victims. b. Rachel Auerbach In 1946, the Polish Jewess Rachel Auerb ach, who had not been interned in Treblinka herself but had supposedly received her information from former inmates, wrote a work in the Yiddish language about the camp, which was published in 1979 in English by Alexander Donat under the title In the fields of Treblinka . 29 R. Auerbach attacked W. Grossmann on the basis of the num- ber of three million victims claimed by him. She gives the number of victims with precision as 1,074,000 and writes: “Such places as Treblinka, with th eir huge mass graves, do not need that sort of odd local patriotism which is expressed by exaggerating the number of victims in order to depict the monstrosity of the mass murders committed there. Believe me, over a milli on people killed in the course of one year in one little place is a million times more than a million human brains could grasp. And even half a million would be much more than enough.” (p. 55) Disregarding this praiseworthy refusal to indulge in any kind of exaggera- tion, the authoress reports, among other things, the following concerning Treblinka: “The floor of the gas chambers was sl oping and slippery. The first ones in would slip and fall, never to rise again. Those who followed would top- ple over them. The chamber was packed to the brim. The people were jammed together so closely that they pushed each other into a standing po- sition. Some witnesses report that the people inside the chambers had to    29 Rachel Auerbach, “ In the Fields of Treblinka ,” in: A. Donat, op. cit.

And then, when they stood pressed toge ther, little children were slipped in above their heads like so many bundles. Gas was costly and therefore had to be used economically. At last, the doors were slammed shut. The shift was ready to die. The motor, installed in a workshop ne ar the bathhouse, could be started now. First, a suction pump was brought into play to draw the pure air from the chamber. After that, the pipes to the reservoir of exhaust gas from the motor could be opened. ‘A few minutes later,’ Jews who had worked in that part of the camp re- called, ‘we would hear terrible screams from that building.’ The screams of human pain, terror and despair. At the last moment, it seems, when the pumps started to suck out breathable air, all self-control broke, and there was an outbreak of collective hyster ia inside the gas chamber. Later... in due time... all was quiet again... Perhaps 25 to 45 minutes later, the chutes on the other side could be opened and the corpses tumbled out. The bodies were naked; some of them were white, others were blue and bloated. [p. 35f...] Therefore, in Treblinka as in other places, children were often thrown live into the fire, or into the regular mass grave. The most important con- sideration was to conserve bullets or gas whenever possible. It was also believed that children did not die as easily and quickly from a bullet or from gas as adults did. Doctors had given some thought to this matter, and they had concluded that children have better circulation because their blood vessels were not yet hardened.” (p. 38f.) R. Auerbach surprises her readers with trail-blazing scientific findings such as the discovery that blood “ was found to be a first-class combustion mate- rial ” (p. 38), and imparts the information that the gassing of many thousands of Jews per day was conducted by “ 30 to 40 SS-men, and 200 to 300 Ukrain- ian guards ,” 30 by which she provides a record not especially flattering to her co-religionists. Concerning the artistic events and other diversions in Treb- linka, she has the following to say: “In order to enliven the monotony of their murderous work, the Ger- mans installed at Treblinka a Jewish orchestra, This was in keeping with the established procedure in other camps. This orchestra had a twofold purpose: first, to drown out, as much as that was possible, the screams and moans of the people being driven to their death in the gas chambers; the second, to provide musical entertainm ent for the camp staff, who repre- sented two music-loving nations – Germany and the Ukraine! A band was needed also for the frequent entert ainments, which were arranged here.

[p. 44...] It is said that when Himmler visite d Treblinka late in February, 1943 a special ‘attraction’ should be prepared for him: a party of young women, who had been specially selected for this purpose so that the supreme SS and police chief of the Reich could take aesthetic pleasure in looking at their nude bodies as they demonstrated the workings of the camp, being driven into the ‘bathhouse’ and then dumped out as corpses... As the Italian saying goes: ‘ Se non è vero, è ben trovato .’” (p. 48) The last sentence means: “ Even if it’s not true, it’s well invented. ” This ap- plies in full compass to Rachel Auerbach‘s ‘factual report’ about Treblinka. c. Zdzis ł aw Ł ukaszkiewicz Likewise in the year 1946, there app eared in the bulletin of the Main Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes in Poland 31 a thirty-page article by Judge Zdzis ł aw Ł ukaszkiewicz under the title “ Obóz zag ł ady Treb- linka ” 32 (The Extermination Camp Treblinka). In the introduction to this work, in which the “ preliminary investigations ” are described, the author states: “The basis of the evidentiary material, upon which the preliminary in- vestigations rest as represented in th e following, are above all the witness statements of thirteen Jews, former prisoners of the camp Treblinka, who managed to escape death by the fact that during the armed revolt of August 2, 1943, they fled the camp. The following are the witnesses: Jankiel Wiernik, Henryk Poswolski, Aron Czec howicz, Abe Kon, Oskar Strawczy ń - ski, Samuel Reisman [33] , Aleksander Kudlik, Hejnoch Brenner, Stanis ł aw Kon, Eugeniusz Turow ski, Henryk Reichman [34] , Szyja Warszawski and Leon Finkelsztejn.” As supplementary evidence, Z. Ł ukaszkiewicz mentions the statements of eleven Polish railway workers as well as documents of the railroad, from which is said to come the number of pr isoners brought to Treblinka, and coins and documents excavated from the grounds of the camp as well as the results    31 Out of consideration for the allied communist East German state later renamed to ‘Main Commission for the Investigation of Hitlerite Cr imes in Poland’ and, after the collapse of the Communist regime, to ‘Main Commission for th e Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish People.’ 32 Zdzis ł aw Ł ukaszkiewicz, “ Obóz zag ł ady Treblinka ,” in Biuletyn G ł ównej Komisji Badania Zbrodni Niemieckich w Polsce , no. 1, Posen 1946, pp. 133-144. 33 More often spelled as Rajman. 34 This witness later called himself Yehiel Reichman(n). He appeared as prosecution witness against John Demjanjuk at the Je rusalem trial. Cf. Chapter V."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 26 of forensic investigations and land surveys. 35 But the declarations of the thir- teen Jewish witnesses are the sole basis of proof for the claimed mass exter- mination. According to Ł ukaszkiewicz, there were two 36 gas chambers in Treblinka in the beginning, to which ten more were added later. The murders were committed with engine exhaust gas. The bodies were burned under the open sky, in that 2,500 were placed upon ope n grates at a time and turned into ashes. In the camp hospital, the German s and their Ukrainian assistants had killed large numbers of prisoners by a shot in the back of the neck; old people, the infirm, and children without relatives we re led off directly after their arri- val at the hospital and shot. A total of at least 731,600 people had been mur- dered in Treblinka, but the total numbe r of victims was in reality higher. 37 In the same year, therefore still in 1946, Z. Ł ukaszkiewicz compiled a sig- nificantly more detailed report about the camp under the title “ Obóz strace ń w Treblince ” (The Execution Camp in Treblinka), which to some extent marked the transition from pure atrocity propaga nda à la Grossmann and Auerbach to an account, which purported to be scientific. 38 In accord with this, the style is also much more sober than is the case with Grossmann and Auerbach, and de- scriptions of patent impossibilities are rare r. Nevertheless, this work also bears quite unmistakably the stamp of propaga nda and possesses but slight scientific value. Ł ukaszkiewicz tersely gives the number of victims of the camp now as 800,000; nearly all of the murdered were Jews, but a certain number of Poles and Gypsies were also killed. 39 The details given by Ł ukaszkiewicz correspond in all essential points to the Treblinka version endorsed by the west ern orthodox ‘Holocaust’ historians. d. N. Blumental Likewise in Poland and yet again in 1946, a collection of documents ap- peared, edited by N. Blumental, a memb er of the Central Jewish Historical Commission, under the title Dokumenty i Materia ł y , which contains an eight- een-page report about Treblinka. 40 This consists of an introduction as well as reports of two former Jewish prisoners of the camp, Szymon Goldberg and Samuel Rajzman. We will later cite excerpts from these reports.    35 Z. Ł ukaszkiewicz, op. cit. (note 32), p. 133. 36 Later three gas chambers were spoken of at first. 37 Z. Ł ukaszkiewicz, op. cit.

Marian Muszkat In 1948, a Marian Muszkat prepared a ‘documentation’ in Poland for the UN Commission for the Investigation of War Crimes, in which the subject of Treblinka arose and in which several former inmates of the camp were quoted. 41 As a sample we quote here an excerpt from the ‘experience report’ by witness Jan Su ł kowski: 42 “The Germans built a so called ‘dea th-bridge’ which consisted of a scaffold 3-4 metres high. The German [Lampert] picked out some Jews and ordered them to climb on to the bridge. During the climbing the Jews were shot at. If there was a Jew who, by some miracle, succeeded in climbing right to the top he would be ordered to take off the shoes and to hold them over his head. This acrobatic trick was very difficult to perform as the whole scaffold was rocking. Then the Jew would be shot. I saw myself the SS men indulging in this ‘innocent’ game.” Eyewitness Leon Finkelsztejn relates: 43 “Bilitz Alfred and Gens Adolf stood at the entrance to the gas chambers and cut women’s breasts off with long knives.” Two further eyewitnesses, Hejnoch Brenner and Zygmunt Blacherski, had also seen how Bilitz cut off women’s breasts. 43 – At the Jerusalem trial of John Demjanjuk, there was no more men tion of Alfred Bilitz and Adolf Gens; now it had been the defendant Demjanj uk, who was accused to have stood at the entrance of the gas chamber(s) and hacked off the breasts of women by choice with a dagger or a sword. 44 After the appearance of this ‘documentation,’ there was a long period of si- lence insofar as the topic of Treblinka was concerned, and for a full 18 years indeed, no book, not even a noteworthy article, appeared about the camp. It was not before 1966, after the great Frankfurt Auschwitz trial, that eyewit- nesses and chroniclers again announced their intention to be heard. f. Jean-François Steiner In 1966, the French-Jewish author Jean-François Steiner – with the assis- tance of the ghost-writer Gilles Perrault – published a novel 45 allegedly based upon the statements of former prisoners with the title Treblinka , 46 which con-   41 Polish charges against German War Criminals , submitted to the United Nations War Crimes Commission by Dr. Marian Muszkat, Warsaw 1948.

His name was Herbert Floss, and he was a specialist in the crema- tion of bodies. [...] The first bonfire was prepared the next day. Herbert Floss then re- vealed his secret: all the bodies did not burn at the same rate; there were good bodies and bad bodies, fire-resistant bodies and inflammable bodies. The art consisted in using the good ones to burn the bad ones. According to his investigations-and judging fr om the results, they were very thorough- the old bodies burned better than the new ones, the fat ones better than the thin ones, the women better than the men, and the children not as well as the women but better than the men. It was evident that the ideal body was the old body of a fat woman. Floss had these put aside. Then he had the men and children sorted too. When a thousand bodies had been dug up and sorted in this way, he proceeded to the loading, with the good fuel under- neath and the bad above. He refused gasoline and sent for wood. His dem- onstration was going to be perfect. The wood was arranged under the grill of the pyre in little piles which resembled camp fires. The moment of truth had come. He was solemnly handed a box of matches. He bent down, lit the first fire, then the others, and as the wood began to catch fire he walked back with his odd gait to the group of officials who were waiting a little way away. The mounting flames began to lick at the bodies, gently at first, then with a steady force like the flame of a blow torch. Everyone held his breath, the Germans anxious and impa tient, the prisoners dismayed and terrified. Only Floss seem ed relaxed; very sure of himself, he was mutter- ing abstractedly, ‘ Tadellos, tadellos... ’ The bodies burst into flames. Sud- denly the flames shot up, releasing a cloud of smoke, a deep roar arose, the faces of the dead twisted with pain and the flesh crackled. The spectacle had an infernal quality and even the S.S. men remained petrified for a few moments, contemplating the marvel. Fl oss beamed.

An extraordinary party began. The first toast was made to the Führer . The operators of the excavators had returned to their machines. When the S.S. men raised their glasses noisily, the excavators seemed to come to life and suddenly flung their long jointed arms toward the sky in a thr obbing and jolting Nazi salute. It was like a signal; ten times the men raised their arms, each time shouting ‘Heil Hitler . ’ The manlike machines returned the salute of the machinelike men, and the air rang with shouts of glory to the Führer . The party lasted until the funeral pyre was entirely consumed . After the toasts came the songs, savage and cruel, songs of hatred, songs of fury, songs of glory to Ger- many the eternal.” Even one hundred percent loyal advocates of the orthodox ‘Holocaust’ im- age have grasped that this sort of st atement undermines the credibility of their position. Thus fourteen years later, th e French Jew Pierre Vidal-Naquet, who in the beginning had expressed his “ admiration ” for Steiner‘s book, 49 sud- denly spoke of “ sub-literature ” appealing to sadism and admitted that he had “ walked into the snare set by J.-F. Steiner .” 50 Another French critic, Didier Daeningckx, devastatingly described Steiner‘s book as “ a false novel, which is presented as true ” and which makes use of the “ technique of parallel mon- tage .” 51 g.

Martin Gray In 1971, the Polish-born French Jew Ma rtin Gray published a book entitled Au nom de tous les miens 53 (In the name of all of mine), in which he describes, inter alia , an alleged stay in Treblinka. Gray‘s ghostwriter was his co- religionist Max Gallo, who interviewed th is ‘Treblinka survivor’ and put his statements down on paper. In his introduction, Gallo wrote: 54 “We saw each other every day for months. [...] I questioned him; I made tape recordings; I observed him; I verified things; I listened to his voice and to his silences. I discovered th e modesty of this man and his in- domitable determination. I measured in his flesh the savagery and barba- rism of the century that had produced Treblinka. [...] I rewrote, confronted the facts, sketched in the background, attempted to re-create the atmos- phere.” As fruit of the collaboration between Gallo and Gray, a book emerged with passages such as the following: 55 “Sometimes we found living children among the warm bodies. Little children, still alive, clinging to thei r mothers’ bodies. We strangled them with our own hands before throwing them into the grave. And we risked our lives doing it because we were wasting time. The butchers wanted eve- rything to happen fast.” After Gray had survived Treblinka and the war in a miraculous manner, he emigrated to the USA, where, as he re lates in his book, he became wealthy by the sale of fake antiques. After the publication of the English version of his book, he was – according to Robert Faurisson – “ suspected of fabricating false memoirs, just as he had produced false antiques, in both instances not without the help of others and naturally for money. ” 56 Even anti-revisionist authors like the French Jew Eric Conan, who speaks of a work “ well-known to all his- torians of this epoch as fraudulent ,” 57 have castigated M. Gray‘s hackwork as a blatant falsification, but this does not change the fact that this unspeakable piece of trash – exactly like that of J.-F. Steiner – keeps reappearing in new editions in France and Germany. i.

Stangl had been sentenced to life imprisonment by a Düsseldorf court in 1970. Sereny‘s book is largely based upon these interviews (as well as upon those with three other SS-men who served at Treblinka during the war and w ith some former Jewish prisoners of the camp). According to Gitta Sereny, Stangl confirmed the official picture of Treb- linka in his conversations with her. But her book is totally worthless as an his- torical source, since the author cannot produce a trace of proof that Stangl ac- tually made the statements ascribed to hi m; that is to say, a recorded protocol of the talks does not exist. On June 28, 1971, one day after the final visit of Sereny, Stangl suddenly died under une xplained circumstances, and because no denial was to be expected from a dead man, the author of Into that Dark- ness was able to put into his mouth whatever pleased her. The French revisionist Pierre Gu illaume recalls a discussion conducted with G. Sereny, which he described as follows: 60 “After we had seated ourselves at the table, ordered drinks, and ex- changed the usual empty civilities, this is the gist of what I said to Gitta Sereny: ‘I have read your book more than once, and many passages even several times. On the first reading, one cannot doubt the truth of the state- ments as well as the reality of the confessions of Stangl. But the more often I went through the text, the greater beca me my amazement, first of all, less on the basis of what I was reading than on the basis of the obvious absence of that, which one would have expected to find. Lastly, with the repeated and very precise readings of the passages where Stangl ‘confesses,’ my amazement increased even more, for without exception they were written in indirect or ambiguous style, so that it became impossible to distinguish in these passages between what Stangl had said and what Gitta Sereny had said.’ I made some significant facial expres sions and then, quietly looking my conversational partner in the eye and giving emphasis to every single word, I said: ‘In brief: he did not confess!’ ‘But of course not... he couldn’t do it!’ Gitta Sereny was of the opinion th at she had served a therapeutic and wholesome function with respect to Sta ngl, in that she was helping him to relieve his conscience by a confession, which was too terrible for him to have been able to make entirely alone.

Upon reading of Gitta Sereny‘s book one does indeed feel “amazement on the basis of the obvious absence of that, which one would have expected to find” : In this poor work of over 400 pages, there is, to be sure, an abundance of stupefying psychological ruminations, yet not the slightest suggestion as to the practical process of the claimed mass murders in Treblinka, such as the manner of functioning of the gas chambers or the methods employed for the destruction without a trace of approximately 800,000 bodies.

In addition to the text by Rachel Auerbach already men- tioned, which had appeared in 1946 in Yiddish and was now published for the first time in English as “ The Fields of Treblinka ”, this book also contained contributions of six other authors (Abr aham Krzepicki, Jankiel Wiernik, Sam- uel Willenberg, Tanhum Grinberg, Shalom Cohen, and Samuel Rajzman). Ac- cording to the introduction written by Donat himself, these reports were com- posed “ without dramatization, embellishments, inventions, and hollow phra- ses. ” 4 Just how seriously this promise is to be taken is shown not only by the fact that the impossible horror report by R. Auerbach is reproduced without commentary; additionally and inter alia , a text of Jankiel Wiernik, which we shall discuss in detail later, is cited as a serious source, which claims: 63 “When corpses of pregnant women were cremated, their bellies would burst open. The fetus would be exposed and could be seen burning inside the mother’s womb.” In a review that appeared in 1981 in the Journal of Historical Review , Horst Kehl had this to say about Donat‘s anthology: 64 “If it is impossible to tear a child in half; [...] if it is impossible to cram people into half a square foot each; if it is impossible to use women as kin- dling and scoop up buckets of human fat; if it is impossible to leap over a 9 feet high fence; just what other parts of this saga are true?” m.

Eugen Kogon, Hermann La ngbein, Adalbert Rückerl et al. In 1983, an authors collective, directed by E. Kogon, H. Langbein, and A. Rückerl, published the tome Nazi Mass Murder . In the introduction, the au- thors rail against “ those who [...] deny the killing of millions of victims by gas” and their alleged “ desire to defend the Nazi system ,” but specify neither authors nor titles. The fact that such deniers exist, the introduction goes on to say, “ is sufficient to justify our intention to set down, in a precise and indis- putable manner, the historical truth ” 66 This “ historical truth ” is “ set down, in a precise and indisputable manner ,” mainly by means of eyewitness testi- mony and confessions of alleged perpetra tors. An Abraham Goldfarb is one of the chief witnesses for the claimed mass murders in Treblinka, and the author cites him as follows: 67 “On the way to the gas chambers Germans with dogs stood along the fence on both sides. The dogs had been trained to attack people; they bit the men’s genitals and the women’s breasts, ripping off pieces of flesh. The Germans hit the people with whips and iron bars to spur them on, so that they would press forward into the ‘showers’ as quickly as possible. The screams of the women could be heard far away, even in the other parts of the camp. The Germans drove the running victims on with shouts of ‘Faster, faster, the water is getting cold, and others still have to take a shower!’ To escape from the blows, the victims ran to the gas chambers as quickly as they could, the stronger on es pushing the weaker ones aside. At the entrance to the gas chambers stood the two Ukrainians, Ivan De- maniuk [68] and Nikolai, one of them armed with an iron bar, the other with a sword. Even they drove the people inside with blows... As soon as the gas chambers were full, the Ukrainians closed the doors and started the engine. Some twenty to twenty-five minutes later an SS man or a Ukrainian looked through a window in the door. When he had made sure that everyone had been asphyxiated, the Jewish prisoners had to open the doors and remove the corpses. Because the chambers were over- crowded and the victims had held on to one another, they were all standing upright and were like one single mass of flesh.” Since these kinds of witness statements clearly satisfied the authors, they did not make the least attempt to furnish material or documentary evidence for the claimed mass murder in Treblinka (or the other ‘extermination camps’).    66 E.

Claude Lanzmann In 1985, the nine-and-a-half-hour film Shoa debuted, shot by the French- Jewish director Claude Lanzmann. It pu rsued the aim of proving, on the basis of eyewitness narratives of ‘Holocaust-survivors,’ the annihilation of the Jews in ‘extermination camps,’ among them also Treblinka. In the introductory note to the book of the same name, which contains the entire spoken text of the film, Simone de Beauvoir wrote: 69 “After the war we read masses of accounts of the ghettos and the ex- termination camps, and we were de vastated. But when, today, we see Claude Lanzmann’s extraordinary film, we realize we have understood nothing. In spite of everything we knew, the ghastly experience remained remote from us. Now, for the first time, we live it in our minds, hearts and flesh. It becomes our experience.” In order to gain a notion of the standard of this film and of the book of the same title, we now reproduce an excerpt from the conversation in it between the director and his star eyewitness, the Treblinka barber Abraham Bomba. We are quoting here from the English translation: 70 “ [Lanzmann:] How did it look, the gas chamber? [Bomba] It was not a big room, around twelve feet by twelve feet. [...] And then one of the kapos came in a nd said: ‘Barbers, you have to do a job to make all those women coming in beli eve that they are just taking a hair- cut and going in to take a shower, and from there they go out from this place.’ We know already that there is no way of going out from this room [...] ’ And suddenly you saw the women comming? Yes, they came in. How were they? They were undressed, naked, without clothes, without anything else [...] There were no mirrors? No, there were no mirrors. There were just benches—not chairs, just benches—where we worked, about sixteen or seventeen barbers [...] You said there were about sixteen barbers? You cut the hair of how many women in one batch? In one day there was about, I would say, going into that place between sixty and seventy women in the same r oom at one time.

The Operation Reinhard Death Camps . But even many footnotes are unable to disguise the fact that Arad‘s claims of exterminations are based ex- clusively upon those eyewitness narratives whose worth we can easily ap- praise after the examples, which have b een cited up to this point. Arad‘s book, which is generally considered today to be the standard work about Treblinka as well as the two other ‘camps of Oper ation Reinhardt,’ contains blatant im- possibilities. For example, Arad writes about the “ old gas chambers ” of the camp in this manner: 72 “At the entrance to the gas chamb ers stood two Ukrainians, Ivan De- mianuk and Nikolai, one armed with an iron bar and the other with a sword, and they, too, urged the people on with blows to push their way in – 200-250 in a chamber of 16 square meters. [...] There were instances when the gas chambers were opened too early and the victims were still alive; the doors would have to be closed again. The engines that produced and fed th e gas into the chambers also broke down, causing stoppages in the extermination operation. Breakdowns of this nature also occurred when the vi ctims were already inside the gas chambers, and they would then be held there for long hours until the en- gines had been repaired.” Under the unrealistic assumption that it was possible to pen up 200 to 250 people in a chamber sixteen square meters in size (and 2.6 m high 73 ) without fresh air supply, the pitiable victims wo uld certainly not have had to wait out “ long hours ” when there were engine breakdow ns, since they would have suf- focated a long time before that; one woul d therefore have been able to spare the engine.    72 Yitzhak Arad, Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka.

Ryszard Czarkowski In 1989, a book appeared in Poland entitled Cieniom Treblinki ([dedicated to] The Shadows of Treblinka). The au thor, a Ryszard Czarkowski, had been interned in the labor camp Treblinka I during the war, barely three kilometers from the ‘extermination camp’ Treblinka II. According to the introduction to this work, the prisoners of the labor camp were able to observe the process of mass murders in the adjacent ‘extermination camp,’ since “ there were con- tacts of labor between the two centers .” 76 Czarkowski criticizes Z. Ł ukaszkiewicz because of the number of Treb- linka victims, 800,000, given by the latter; by means of eyewitness narratives as well as some counts of the deportation trains, he determin es the number of murdered to be 1,582,000. 77 The question of how 1,582,000 bodies might have been disposed of with- out a trace evidently gives him as little occasion for reflection as does the question of why Stalinist Polish historiography and judiciary of the post-war years should have reduced the number of Treblinka victims down to half of what he claims to be true, and are th us supposed to have minimized the Na- tional Socialist crimes in a scandalous way. r.

Benz and his co- authors defend the usual figure of about six million Jewish victims. With re- spect to Treblinka, Benz repeats the victims number of 1,074,000 as given by Rachel Auerbach in 1946, since this “ seems more realistic to us than the de- monstrable minimal number. ” 80 That the authors collective classifies Rachel Auerbach‘s work, according to which blood in Treblinka proved to be “ first- class combustion material ,” as a serious source, already says much about the quality of this collection. Germar Rudolf, who compared the works of Sanning and Benz and has demonstrated the blat ant demographic manipulations of the Benz team, comments in this regard: 81 “Thus, Treblinka with its more than one million victims is weighted more heavily in Benz’s analysis than Ausch witz is – a completely new trend in Holocaust studies.” As Rudolf correctly points out, this raising of the number of Treblinka vic- tims serves the purpose of enabling the sacrosanct six-million-figure to be maintained despite the drastic loweri ng of the number of victims of Ausch- witz, which has occurred in recent years. t.

There, for example, one reads about the Greek Jews who arrived in Treblinka in the spring of 1943: 83 “Early in spring of 1943 the whistle of a train heralded the arrival of a new shipment. A slightly strange crowd spilled out – people with dark faces, curly, raven-black hair, and a fo reign tongue on their lips. The suit- cases taken out of the wagons bore labels reading ‘Saloniki’. Word that Jews from Greece had arrived spread around the camp like lightning. [...] Every last one of them exited the cars in a state of total calm. [... The SS- man] Mitte found three Greeks with a command of German and drafted them as interpreters.” In Glazar’s book, this is described as follows: 84 “People climb calmly out of the cars, without pushing, without crowd- ing. [...] Apparently they have been in quarantine too. [...] Their faces look healthy, and they have an unusual dark complexion. Black hair – all I see black to pitch-black hair.

Next he cl aims that he was part of Treblinka’s “ camouflage commando ”: 86 “There are a few here, until now the only ones, who have been allowed to work in contact with nature, to see the camp of death from the outside, [...] when they are driven out of the camp and into the forest, when they break branches off pine trees and collect them, [...]. But in the camouflage commando they only keep workers who are fit enough to climb high up into the trees and trot back to camp carryi ng heavy bundles of branches. They weave these branches into strands of barbed wire, thus maintaining the camouflage green around the entire perimeter of the camp” “The camouflage unit is the only one of the old work squads that still has enough real work to do.

All Glazar, the lumberjack of Treblinka, knows about how the corpses we re allegedly incinerated is the fol- lowing: 85 “You have to build big bonfires and put a lot of kindling in among the corpses, and then douse the whole thing in something very flammable.” u. Jean-Claude Pressac In 1995, the French magazine Historama published an article by Jean- Claude Pressac, 89 a researcher who, to be sure, considered the gas chambers to be an historical fact but who – in comparison with the other representatives of the official version of history – clearly maintained a relatively critical attitude toward witness testimonies. In his cont ribution, Pressac was chiefly concerned with Auschwitz, but he also took up the subject of Treblinka, Sobibór, and Be łż ec. In contrast to the conventional historiography, according to which these camps were set up exclusively for the extermination of Jews, Pressac opines that they were originally estab lished as transit or as delousing camps and only later were converted into ex termination camps. We shall examine this thesis of Pressac more closely in another chapter. 90 Likewise in 1995, Pressac granted an interview to a Valérie Igounet, which was first published as late as 2000, with changes made according to Pressac’s    87 Ibid ., p. 127f. 88 See Chapter IV.12.f. for details. Even if such a camouflage unit existed, it sure would have felled trees and cut the branches then instead of having some guys climb up trees. Such an activity is ridiculous. 89 J.-C.

In it, Pressac de nounced the official account of the concentrations camps as being distinguished by “ bungling, exaggeration, omission, and lies ,” 91 and he determined that the concept of ‘genocide’ for the National So- cialist policy against the Jewish is uncalled for. 92 He also posited a drastic re- duction in the number of victims in the ‘pure extermination camps,’ among them Treblinka. 93 v. Assessment After what has been said to this point, our judgment with respect to the pic- ture of the camp drawn by the orthodox historians must be a devastating one: the few works that proceed scientifical ly support their claims without excep- tion with unreliable sources; the bunglings of brazen liars are accepted as clas- sics of the Treblinka literature. In short: the value of the official historiogra- phy about the camp is wretchedly insignificant! 2. Treblinka in Revisionist Literature a. Treblinka and the Gerstein Report Because the official historiography dealing with the ‘Holocaust’ has from the very beginning focused upon Auschwitz, the revisionists, who had to con- front their opponents on the field chosen by the latter, have likewise concen- trated quite predominantly upon the c oncentration camp Auschwitz and de- voted significantly less attention to Treblinka. Treblinka was at least touched upon by some revisionist authors in connec- tion with the so-called ‘Gerstein Report.’ The alleged confessions of the SS- officer Kurt Gerstein, who according to his ‘confessions’ visited Be łż ec and Treblinka in the year 1942, are considered to be one of the supporting pillars of the ‘Holocaust.’ In Be łż ec, Gerstein purports to have attended a gassing of people, the description of which, however , abounds in impossibilities: thus, he claims that in the gas chamber 700 to 800 victims were crammed together in “ 25 square meters, in 45 cubic meters ”! The Frenchman Paul Rassinier, former resistance fighter, prisoner in the concentration camps Buchenwald and Dora-Mittlebau, as well as founder of Revisionism, has pointed out the dubiousness of the Gerstein Report in his 1964 book Le Drame des Juifs Européens 94 and stressed its worthlessness as an historical source. Another French researcher, Henri Roques, has proved in    91 Valérie Igounet, Histoire du négationnisme en France , Editions du Seuil, Paris 2000. 92 Ibid ., p. 641. 93 See Chapter III. 94 Paul Rassinier, Le drame des juifs européens , Les sept couleurs, Paris 1964."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 42 his 1989 doctoral dissertation that not fewe r than six versions of the Gerstein Report exist, deviating from one another substantially in parts. 95 However, since Gerstein described a gassing event in Be łż ec and not in Treblinka, the studies of Rassinier and Roques demolish above all the credibility of his statements about the former camp. In c ontrast to the two French historians, Carlo Mattogno dealt more in depth with Treblinka in his 1985 work Il rap- porto Gerstein, Anatomia di un falso , which is also devoted to the Gerstein Report. In it, Mattogno suggested that “ the myth about the gas chambers pre- vailed only relatively ” regarding Treblinka b ecause in 1943, in the Black Book of Polish Jewry , steam chambers for the extermination of the Jews were spo- ken of, and the same method of killing was still mentioned in the December 1945 Nuremberg Document PS-3311, produced by the Polish government. Only in February 1946, according to Mattogno, did the Jewish witness Samuel Rajzman speak of gas chambers before the Nuremberg Court. 96 Up to the present time, mainly four revisionist authors have led a massive assault against the foundations of the official picture of Treblinka: Friedrich P. Berg, John C. Ball, Udo Walendy, and Arnulf Neumaier, of which the first two authors have investigated important individual aspects of the question, while the latter two have made a co mprehensive attack upon the current ver- sion of Treblinka. b. Friedrich P. Berg In 1984, the graduate Engineer F.P. Be rg published a trail-blazing article in the Journal of Historical Review , entitled: “ The Diesel Gas Chambers: Myth within a Myth ,” 97 in which he subjected the diesel engine claimed as a murder weapon for Treblinka, Sobibór, and Be łż ec to technical and toxicological ex- amination. An expanded German transl ation appeared in 1994 in the antholo- gy Grundlagen zur Zeitgeschichte . 98 In the English edition of the last-named work, Dissecting the Holocaust , last published in the year 2003, Berg‘s con- tribution appeared in a further revised and improved version. 99 In his study, Berg proved that diesel exhaust gases are unthinkably poorly suited for the mass killing of human bei ngs because of their high oxygen con- tent and their very low content of carbon monoxide (CO); a gasoline engine    95 Henri Roques, “ Les confessions de Kurt Gerstein, étude comparative des six versions ,” in: André Chelain, La thèse de Nantes et l’affaire Roques , Polémiques, Paris 1988. 96 Carlo Mattogno, Il rapporto Gerstein, Anatomia di un falso , Sentinella d’Italia, Monfalcone 1985, pp. 167ff. 97 Journal of Historical Review 5 (1), 1984, pp. 15-46. 98 Friedrich P.

We shall re turn to this topic in connection with the critique of witness testimonies in Chapter IV. Berg‘s study shook the current version of Treblinka, Sobibór, and Be łż ec right to the very foundations. If the Germans had really succeeded in gassing approximately 1.72 million Jews 100 in these three camps in record time and in removing all trace of their bodies, they would have to have been technical geniuses, and such geniuses would certainly not have resorted to that sort of inefficient weapon of murder. The objection that perhaps the instrument of the crime had been a gasoline engine would be untenable, for the witnesses of the gassing claim that the exhaust gases had been produced by the engines of cap- tured Russian tanks, and the Russian tanks of the Second World War were primarily driven by diesel engines. The updated German edition of the Ency- clopedia of the Holocaust maintains, plainly and clearly: 101 “Be łż ec, Sobibór, and Treblinka were built within the framework of the Operation Reinhardt (so called from June of 1942) of the murder cam- paign against, above all, the Jews from the General Gouvernement. These extermination camps used carbon mono xide gas, which was produced by diesel engines.” Whoever may object that the witnesses had possibly made false statements in regard to the weapon of the crime is simultaneously discrediting, along with the credibility of the witness testimony, the entire picture of the ‘eastern ex- termination camps,’ which is based exclusively upon just these witness state- ments!    100 According to the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust (note 18) 870,000 in Treblinka, 600,000 in Be łż ec as well as 250,000 in Sobibór. 101 Eberhard Jäckel, Peter Longeri ch, Julius H.

John C. Ball No less important than the technical and toxicological investigations of Berg are the analyses of Allied and German photographs, which were taken during the war over the ‘extermination camps,’ among them also Treblinka. These analyses were performed by the Canadian professional air photo inter- preter John C. Ball and presented in 1992 in his book Air Photo Evidence . 102 We will also return to these photographs. d. Udo Walendy The German political scientist Udo Wa lendy, editor and publisher of the German historiographic series Historische Tatsachen (historical facts), has dealt with Treblinka in two issues of this periodical. No. 12 from 1982 ana- lyzes, inter alia , the trial conducted in Düsseldorf in 1964/1965 against former members of the staff of the Treblinka camp. 103 In it, Walendy acutely attacks the legal basis of this trial and exposes numerous absurdities in the arguments supporting the verdict. We reproduce an excerpt from his commentary here: 104 “50 SS-men manage, with the assistance of a tank engine, to kill ap- proximately 700,000 people within a year and remove all traces. That is 14,000 per SS-guard, or just 40 per day, a total for all 50 of 2,000 per day. But wait: according to other claims [...] , it was supposed to be 8,000 or 30,000 daily! Note well: per day! With all this, these people still had tim e to pause for sadistic atrocities and continually invent new ones, with and without riding crops. To be sure, the normal life of the camp broke down, but obviously everything func- tioned, from the disinfection of the cut-off women’s hair, to the separation of the Stars of David from the clothing, from the burning of the bodies, which had already been buried in larg e mass-pits, to the total elimination of all traces, including sifting of the ashes, crushing of the bones, and the mixing of the ashes with the soil as we ll as the leveling of the whole camp. [...] Neither attorneys nor experts, jurors, judges, ‘historians’ or newspa- per writers have burdened themselves to worry about any of the technical impossibilities that are becoming obvious here – and add to this in the midst of war, with a 50-man German guard detachment .” Issue no. 44 of the Historische Tatsachen , which appeared eight years later, was devoted exclusively to the camp Treblinka and thus was also called    102 John C.

Grossmann‘s grotesque writing Die Hölle von Treb- linka (The Hell of Treblinka) and subseque ntly dealt with the following top- ics: – The Black Book , published in 1946 by the World Jewish Congress, claims that three million people had been murdered in Treblinka by means of “ assembly-line execution ”; – The contradictions in the standard literature regarding the geographical information given about Treblinka as well as between the various sketches produced by ‘eyewitnesses’; – The lack of credibility of witness statements; – An analysis of air photographs refuting extermination claims. No. 44 of the Historische Tatsachen represented the most thorough and comprehensive critique made up to that point of the orthodox Treblinka ver- sion.

Arnulf Neumaier Since the official Treblinka version stands or falls with the possibility of the elimination of the bodies without trace by the method and manner asserted by the witnesses, Neumaier‘s calculations in regard to this are especially im- portant. In 1994, as part of the anthology Grundlagen zur Zeitgeschichte , an out- standing article appeared entitled “ Der Treblinka-Holocaust ,” written by the graduate Engineer Arnulf Neumaier. 107 A translation with the title “ The Treb- linka Holocaust ” appeared in the English version of the same book. 108 In it, the author subjected the technical prer equisites for the claimed extermination of Jews in Treblinka to a comprehensive examination. He took up Berg‘s ar- guments against the viability of the alle ged mass murder by means of diesel exhaust and brought up additional aspects, made reference to the massive con- tradictions of the witness statements, which name several entirely different methods of killing, and in particular turned to the subject of the disposal of the bodies.    105 Historische Tatsachen no. 44, “ Der Fall Treblinka ”, Vlotho 1990. 106 Cf.

The Thesis of the Transit Camp The revisionist studies mentioned to this point have restricted themselves exclusively to refuting the official pi cture of Treblinka as an “extermination camp.” An alternative interpretation of its function has not appeared in these studies, which of course is the direct consequence of the complete lack of con- temporary documents. Yet some notable revisionist authors have proposed the thesis that Treblinka was a transit camp for Jews. The American scholar Prof. Dr. Arthur R. Butz suggested in his revisionist classic The Hoax of the Twen- tieth Century , which appeared for the first time in 1976, that Treblinka simul- taneously served as a labor camp as well as a transit camp for Jews resettled to the east, 109 and Prof. Robert Faurisson also supports the transit camp thesis. 110 Finally, US historian Mark Weber, toge ther with US lawyer Andrew Allen, wrote an excellent article about Treblin ka in 1992, in which the two authors summarized all the familiar arguments made to that point in time against the thesis of the ‘extermination camp,’ introduced new viewpoints in the field, and wrote concerning the actual nature of the camp: 111 “If Treblinka was not an extermi nation center, what was it? [...] the balance of evidence indicates that Treblinka II – along with Belzec and Sobibor – was a transit camp, where Jewish deportees were stripped of their property and valuables before bei ng transferred eastwards into Ger- man-occupied Soviet territories.” Since Treblinka was much too small to be able to accommodate the large number of Jews deported there at the same time, the transit camp thesis is, in fact, the single plausible alternative to the conventional picture of the extermi- nation camp.

The Secondary Killing Methods As we have seen in the introduction, there was little secret about Treblinka. In fact, already since August 1942, de tailed reports about this camp were reaching Warsaw. These were essentially coming from Jews who had fled from Treblinka, from the populace, which resided in the area surrounding the camp, as well as from the Polish railway workers who operated the trains with the deportees. In these reports the version of the mass murders, adopted shortly after the war by the official historiography and still accepted today – gassing by means of the exhaust fumes of diesel engines – played an entirely epiphenomenal role. It appears in only two reports, which, moreover, mention some undefined “ toxic fluids ” supposedly mixed with the exhaust gases. On October 5, 1942, the Polish underground newspaper Informacja bie ż - ą ca (Current Information), circulated the following report: 112 “Treblinka. The death camp is once more in operation. Transports ar- rive from the entire country (lastly Radom, Siedlce, Mi ę dzyrzec). Presently not 20 but 10 trains are allowed to approach at a time, for it takes a long time until the bodies of those who died on the way (20-30%) have been unloaded. The gas chambers function as follows: Outside of the barracks is a 20 HP internal combustion engine, which is in operation around the clock. The end of its exhaust pipe is mounted in a wall of the barracks; the exhaust gases, with the admixture of toxic fluids, [113] which have been spe- cially mixed into the fuel of the e ngine, kill the people locked up in the bar- racks.

They are brought into a sealed chamber, a barrack, approximately 100 people at a time. Outside of the barrack stands an internal combustion engine of 20 HP, which runs around the clock. The mouth of the engine’s exhaust leads through the barrack’s wall, and the people locked up in the barrack are killed by exhaust gases channe led through it that contain toxic fluid addi- tives, which have been especially mixed to the engine fuel.” Other murder techniques are also desc ribed in the reports of the Polish un- derground movement. Thus, in an edition of Informacja Bie żą ca dated August 17, 1942, a mobile gas chamber is discussed: 115 “After the departure of the steam e ngines, the Jews are forced to un- dress, supposedly for the bath; then th ey are led into the gas chamber and executed, whereupon they – sometimes still living – are buried in exca- vated pits. The pits are excavated by machine; the gas chamber is mobile and moves back and forth over the pits. The camp strength amounted to 40,000 Jews on August 5, about 5,000 are executed daily. The liquidation is carried out by Ukrainians under the leadership of SS-men. The opera- tion in the Warsaw Ghetto is supposed to be completed by September of this year.” On September 8, 1942, the Informacja Bie żą ca reported on the deployment of an undefined gas with a delayed effect: 116 “The extermination of the Jews takes place entirely independently from the events in the camp. The steam e ngine pushes the cars with the Jews un- der the ramp, all in seque nce. The Ukrainians pull the Jews out of the cars and lead them to the ‘bath’ in the bathhouse. This is a building surrounded by barbed wire. They enter in groups of 300 to 500 persons. Each group is immediately locked up hermetically and gassed. Of course, this gas is not immediately effective, for the Jews ha ve to walk to the pits afterwards, which are about ten to twenty meters away and 30 m deep. There they lose consciousness and fall into the pits, and the excavator sprinkles a thin layer of earth upon them. Then the next group follows.” A further method was a gas – again without further description – with im- mediate effect.

[sic!] ” As part of the same series of reports, a report was also sent to London, which likewise spoke of an extermination of Jews in “ gas chambers .” Infor- mation about what sort of gas was in use was not imparted in it, but there are supposed to have been “ about a hundred gas chambers ”(!): 118 “In this gigantic wooden house, where there were approximately 10,000 people in standing positions, an SS-officer greeted them very po- litely and said the following, word for word: ‘You have worked too little up to now for the German State, and because of this the German Reich has decided to resettle you in the Ukraine, so that you work more. You are in a transit camp here. You will proceed directly to the bath.’ [...] They finally reach their destination – apparently ba ths, but in realty gas chambers. They walk, a few of them at a time, into one chamber, and there are cer- tainly about a hundred of these chambers. [...] The bodies are piled up in even layers, a hundred at a time, and chlorine is sprinkled on them.” Likewise among the reports delivered to London on March 31, 1943, there was a report with the title “ Charakterystyka metód Treblinki ” (Characteristic of the Methods of Treblinka), in whic h three further murder methods were listed: shooting, trains with uns laked lime, as well as water vapor: 119 “At the beginning of the so-called resettlement operation, when the technical preparations of the machin ery of death were still not perfected, the Germans killed their victims in T reblinka in an extremely simple man- ner: a machine gun opened fire upon a crowd of men, women, and children who were brought forward, and they were shot down, each and every one of them. A crew of gravediggers threw all – the bodies of those killed, the critically wounded, as well as those lightly wounded – into the pits pre- pared up to that time and strewed them over with earth.    117 Ibid ., p. 148. 118 Ibid ., p. 151. 119 Ibid ., pp. 153f."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 50 In August as well as the following months, as the acceleration of the campaign exceeded the possibilities of th e steam chambers, the transports were loaded into cars, which were sprinkled with a layer of lime and chlo- rine, so that after the arrival in T reblinka, exclusively corpses of a violet- blue color were tossed out of the cars. All had suffocated under torment in the cars. For these transports (for example from Mi ę dzyrzec Podl., Kielce) Treblinka was but the place of burial. From this information it emerges that a punctual and precise execution of the drawn-up plan was important to the Germans. The methods descri bed above were practiced when the capacity of the machinery of death in Treblinka was faltering. The teeth of the corpses pulled out of the steam c hambers in Treblinka were examined. Gold teeth and bridges were extracted by means of dental instruments.” In 1946, Eugen Kogon cited in his well-known book Der SS-Staat the eyewitness narrative – originating from the previous year – of an Oskar Ber- ger, who, according to his own statemen ts, had been deported in the July of 1942 from the ghetto of Kielce to Treblinka and had escaped in September of the same year. He stated inter alia : 120 “Sometimes there were shipments that held only corpses. I believe these people must have been gassed in the cars, for I never notice any wounds.” He added that in the beginning the Jew s who had arrived in the camp were shot. During his stay in Treblinka, the Germans had built “ a small brick build- ing .” 121 From then on, according to the witness, “ new arrivals were gassed rather than shot. ” These killing techniques – engine exhaust fumes from fuel mixed with toxic fluids, stationary gas chambers, a mobile gas chamber, gas with a de- layed effect, gas with immediate effect, shootings, train cars strewn with un- slaked lime, electric current 122 – were mentioned in the reports about Treb- linka only sporadically and without further details. The murder method that occupied the foreground, which was described most often as well as in the most detail, was the scalding with steam. 2.

With regard to Treblinka, she set down in this what was said about this camp in the ghetto until the end of 1942: 125 “The worst thing is death in Treblinka. By now, all know of Treblinka. There they cook people alive. They know by now that Bigan has escaped from Treblinka. [...] He [Bigan] will build halls like the ones in Treblinka. Everything will be modern: the boilers that are heated by current, the steam-gas in there, the floor movable and sloping. ‘There I will drive in the Germans, all na- ked. Many, many Germans, so that every corner is made use of, every cen- timeter.’ And from the boilers the ga seous steam is conducted through the pipes, the boilers are red, and the steam... a hellish boiling bath. Four minutes suffice, then the floor flap autom atically drops down, and the slimy mass of red, curled bodies flows away into the cesspit. And finished, the pits are but filled with chlorine, and there is no more trace of what was once alive. ‘All this lasts only seven minutes, you hear me?’” On November 15, 1942, the resistance movement of the Warsaw Ghetto, operating in the underground, composed a long article entitled “ Likwidacja ż ydowskiej Warszawy ” (Liquidation of Jewish Wa rsaw), which contained a detailed description of Treblinka 126 together with a sketch of the camp. 127 Due to the importance of this article, 128 it deserves to be reproduced here in its en- tirety despite its length.

Official Report Submitted to the Polish Government ” 130 and reads as follows: “The village of Treblinka is situated near the Warsaw-Bialystok rail- road line, a few kilometers from Malkinia, in a sandy and wooded area. The population consists of Polish peasant-farmers and forest workers. In 1940, [correct: 1941] the Germans established a penitentiary concentration camp, Treblinka A, on the sandy stretc hes near the village, for Poles who were guilty of transgressions against the occupant, of not supplying the demanded amounts of agricultural pr oduce, or who were caught smug- gling. The discipline at the camp is very strict; prisoners are shot on any pretext. The camp is as notorious as the penitentiary camp at Oswiecim. In March, 1942, the Germans began the construction if another camp, Treblinka B, in the vicinity. That camp has become the slaughter-house for the Jews of Poland and of other European countries. Poles from the nearby Treblinka A, as well as Jews caught in the neighboring villages, were put to work at the preparatory construction. That work lasted until the end of April when the central building of the camp, death-house No. 1, was built. (14). [131] Treblinka B is situated on the sandy hills among woodland. The area of the camp is comparatively small, some 5,000 hectares (about 12,500 acres) . [132] It is entirely surrounded by a green fence interwoven with barbed wire entanglements (3). Part of the fence runs through a young for- est in the north (25). At the four corners of the camp, observation points were placed for the Lagerschutz (Camp Guard). The Lagerschutz consists mostly of Ukrainians armed with machine-guns. At the observation point’s strong searchlights have been placed to light the entire place at night. Ob- servation posts are also set in the middle of the camp and on the hills in the woodlands. The western border of Treblinka B is formed by the rail em- bankment along which runs a side-track that connects the camp with the main railroad-line (1). The side-line (2) was constructed in recent months, in order that the trains of transports might be delivered directly to the slaughter-house. The northern border of the camp is formed in the forest; east and south the border cuts through s andy hills. In the area of the camp, bushes form a long stretch parallel to the railroad tracks starting in the north (25). A railroad-crossing (4) is adjacent to the side-track; trains with trans- ports halt there.    130 Jacob Apenszlak (ed.), The Black Book of Polish Jewry , American Federation for Polish Jews, New York 1943, pp. 141-147. 131 The numbers in parentheses, not included in the English translation, are from the Polish original and refer to the sketches appended to the report.

The square is fe nced in with barbed-wire. On the square, not far from the northern bor der, there is a wooden barracks. In the south-western corner of the squa re there is a guard-house with a mili- tary post on 24-hour duty (7). South of the square, outside of the fence, there is a cloth-sorting place ( Lumpensortierungsplatz ), and further south, there is the execution place of the camp-commandant and the graves of the victims murdered by him (22). The arri val square (6) is connected with rest of the area by an entrance in the nor th-eastern corner of the fence (8). From there, a path runs through the woods for about 200 meters eastwards (9) and then turns at right angles to the south and runs along the forest, parallel to the western limit of the arrival-square. This road stops at a large building of an unusual shape; it is an unfinished one-story brick- construction, about 40 meters long and 15 meters wide. (When we received the information concerning Treblinka B in the first half of September, this building was about to be finished.) Th e Germans began the construction of that building after the action started, probably in the middle of August, with the help of Jewish artisans picked out from among the Jews brought to Treblinka for slaughter. It is significant that the bricks for the construction had been brought from as far as Warsaw, in trucks attached to each trans- port. The bricks were loaded in the Warsaw Umschlagplatz by Jewish workers. According to the report of an eyewitness, the interior of the build- ing is as follows; a corridor 3 meters wide runs through the middle; there are five chambers on each side; the height of each chamber is about 2 me- ters; the area is about 35 square mete rs. The execution chambers are with- out windows, but they have doors opening on the corridor and a type of valve on the outside walls. Next to these valves there are large scoops (they remind one of large vessels). In the wall s pipes were installed from which water-steam is supposed to pour into the chambers. This was to have been death-house No. 2. A path (9) skirts the building and runs along its western wall finally ending at the next building (12) near death-house No. 1 (14). This building is at right-angles to the death-house No . 2. It is a brick construction much smaller than the other. It consists of only three chambers and a steam- room. Along the northern wall of this house runs a corridor from which there are doors to the cham bers. The outside walls of the chambers have valves (until recently doors which had b een changed into valves for utility reasons). Also here a scoop in the shap e of a shallow vessel is placed at the height of the valves (15). The steam-room (15a) is adjacent to the building. Inside the steam-room th ere is a large vat which produces the steam. The hot steam comes in to the chambers through pipes installed there, each having a prescribed number of vents. While this machinery of death is in action, the doors and valves are hermetically closed. The floor"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 54 in the chambers has a terra-cotta inla y which becomes very slippery when water is poured over it. There is a we ll next to the steam-room, the only well in the whole area of Treblinka B. Not far from the death-house, south of the barbed-wire and wooden fences, there is a grave-diggers’ camp. The grave-diggers live in barracks (19) next to which are the kitchen buildings. On both sides of the camp there are two guard-houses (17-20). The re- maining area of Treblinka B is destin ed for the murdered victims. A part of that area is already a large cemetery (2 2, 23, 24). At first, Poles employed in the camps dug the graves; later , as the slaughter was intensified and the need for more ditches grew, special digging-machines (bulldozers) were brought, which ran day and night at grave-digging. A Diesel-motor sup- plies the energy and its rattle is a characteristic sound at Treblinka B. The supervisors and execution-staff are small in numbers. The slaugh- ter-house is commanded by an S.S. man of the rank of major; his name is Sauer). The German staff, consisting of S.S. men, are in terror of their chief. The moment they see him from the distance they drive the Jewish workers as well as the victims on their way to death with even greater en- ergy. Altogether, there are ten Germans and thirty Ukrainians. The German crew changes from time to time; sometimes S.S. men from various towns of the General Government who were active at the deporta- tions there, arrive at the camp. In addition to the German-Ukrainian Lagerschutz , there is also the Jewish auxiliary, part of whom are busy at the sorting place for the cloth- ing of the victims ( Lumpensortierungsplatz ), and part of whom act as grave-diggers. They empty the execu tion chambers and bury the dead; the rest work at the arrival-square. The groups of the Jewish auxiliary service are headed by group-leaders whom the Germans call ‘ kapos .’ They are relatively better fed than the rest and wear a triangular yellow patch at their knees to distinguish them from the other. The personnel of the Jewish auxiliary service undergoes almost daily changes. Rarely can a Jew stand that service for more than two weeks, due to the inhuman treatment they receive at the hands of the Germans. They are constantly tortured and whipped; corporal punishment (25 strokes) is very frequent as well as the shooting of the weak ones who lose their fit- ness to work. This is done mostly by the chief himself. Every day there is a roll-call. The German asks who does not feel strong enough to carry on with the work? A few men step out of the row, report their unfitness and beg him – as though for a favor – to be shot. The executions take place at a special spot; the victim himself stands erect over a grave while the chief shoots at the back of the victim’s head. The next victim has to step nearer and throw the body of the murdered one into the ditch, and then a few mo- ments later, share the fate of hi s predecessor. Thes e young Jews are so overworked that all will to resist is gone; on the other hand, the German"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Chapter II: The Development of the Idea of Treblinka as an Extermination Camp 55 terror is so atrocious that it makes them even want to die so as not to suffer further inhuman tortures. In one of the first days of September, the chief of Treblinka thus murdered 500 young Jews by shooting them one after an- other with his gun; what is startling is that not one of this group of a few hundred men attempted to resist death. The execution lasted from 7:30 to 3 P.M. The relatively lightest work in the deat h in the death camp is the sorting of the clothing of victims. While assigned that work, one can eat to one’s heart’s content, for the ‘deported’ Jews took along large food-stocks: bread, marmalade, fat, sugar. But the chief does not leave the men at this work for any length of time; after a few days, he transfers them to grave- digging. The gaps in the Jewish auxiliary servi ce are supplemented from among the transports arriving in Treblinka. As a rule, two transports arrive daily: one in the morning and one toward evening. In the period of greatest of the action a few transports arrive daily. Each train consists of a few score of freight cars. Some of the cars halt at th e side-track straight across from the arrival-square, while the remaining cars are shifted to the side to wait until the first part is taken care of. The ca rs are quickly emptied. The tortured and excited throng breathes with relief when let out on the square. They are immediately taken over by the Jewish auxiliary guard headed by the ‘ kapos .’ These give orders in Yiddish . The women and children are or- dered to enter the barracks immediat ely while the men remain in the square. Looking around, they see a high pillar with a poster bearing a large inscription: Achtung Warschauer (Attention, natives of Warsaw) de- spite the fact that transports of Jews from many other towns of the General Government, from Germany and the states of Western Europe are also brought to Treblinka. ‘Do not worry about your fate,’ continues the poster. ‘You are all going eastward for work; you will work and your wives will take care of your households. Before leaving, however, you have to take a bath and your clothing must be disinfected. You have to deposit your valu- ables and money with the cashier (of Treblinka) for which you will get re- ceipts. After the bath and disinfection, you will receive everything back un- harmed.’ In the first period of murder in Treblinka an S.S. officer with a kind, confidence-inspiring face used to co me to the square and hold a speech along the same lines. However, when in the course of action ever larger transports arrived from the various parts and the crowds had to be quickly liquidated, the Germans cance lled the speech as superfluous. To make the Jews believe that actual classification according to trades would take place at the arrival-square in order to send occupational groups for labor, they placed small si gns with the inscriptions: Tailors,"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 56 Shoemakers, Carpenters, etc. It goes w ithout saying that such segregation never took place. The ‘ kapos ’ quickly put the men in rows of ten, ordering them to take off their shoes, undress completely and prepare for a bath. Everybody is permitted to take along a piece of soap and his documents [sic] . In the meantime the sorting-service men take away the clothing to the sorting- place. Women and children also ha ve to undress completely. Now comes the last act of the Treblinka tragedy. The terrorized mass of men, women and children starts on its last road to death. At the head a group of women and children is driven, beaten by the accompanying Germans, whips in their hands. The group is driven ever quicker; ever heavier blows fall upon the heads of the women who are mad with fear and suffering. The cries and laments of the women together with the shouts and curses of the Germans interrupt the silence of the forest. Th e people finally realize that they are going to their death. At the entrance of death-house No.1 the chief himself stands, a whip in his hand; beating them in cold blood, he drives the women into the chambers. The floors of the chambers are slippery. The victims slip and fall, and they cannot get up for new numbers of forcibly driven victims fall upon them. The ch ief throws small children into the chambers over the heads of the wome n. When the execution chambers are filled the doors are hermetically closed and the slow suffocation of leaving people begins, brought about by the st eam issuing from the numerous vents in the pipes. At the beginning, s tifled cries penetrate to the outside; gradu- ally they quiet down and 15 minutes later the execution is complete. Now comes the turn of the gra ve diggers. Shouting and cursing, the German overseers drive the diggers to th eir work, which consists of getting the bodies out if the execution chambers. The grave-diggers stand at the scoop, near the valves. The valves open but not a body falls out. Due to the steam all the bodies have become a homogenous mass stuck together with the perspiration of the victims. In their death agonies, arms, legs, trunks are intertwined into a gigantic mac abre entanglement. To make it possible for the grave-diggers to get out single bodies, cold water from the near-by well is poured over the mass. Then the bodies separate and may be taken out. As a rule the surfaces of the bodies are not defaced; only the faces and buttocks are purple. The grave-diggers, constantly beaten and driven by the Germans, place the corpses on the scoops until the chambers are empty. The bodies lie piled up li ke slaughtered cattle. Now the burying takes place. Formerly (during the first half of August), the Jewish grave- diggers had handcarts to convey the bodies to the ditches, which had to be done at top speed. Lately, however, the chief did away with them. ‘ Ein Mann – zwei Leichen ’ (one man, two corpses), meaning that each grave- digger has to bury two corpses. He ties the legs or the arms of the body with his belt and running, pulls it from the scoop to the ditches, throws it in"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Chapter II: The Development of the Idea of Treblinka as an Extermination Camp 57 and, again running, returns for the next load. Formerly the graves were right at the death-house so that the burying of corpses could take place quickly. As new victims were added, the grave-line moved ever further to the east and the pulling of the corp ses tot he graves takes longer and longer. After the ditch is filled, the grave-diggers quickly cover the bodies with earth and the digging-machine nearby prepares the next grave. The execution of the men is identical. They also are driven through the road in the woods to their death. The victims react differently while being driven in the direction of the death-house; some repeat loudly psalms of penitence, confess their sins; others curse God; but a sudden shout of the Germans and the blows falling upon the backs of the doomed men immedi- ately brings silence on the whole crowd. Sometimes all the victims cannot get into the overcrowded chambers; th en the Germans keep the rest in the woods near the slaughter-house. These people see and hear everything but there is no attempt at self-preservation. This is irrefutable proof of the atrocious terror wielded over their vic- tims by the Germans. The new death-house provides for the liquidation of 8,000 to 10,000 victims. If we consider that right now 2,000,000 murdered Jews, or the greater part of Polish Jewry, are already buried in the area of Treblinka, the disturbing question arises: for w hom do the S.S. intend that new house of death; who are to utter their last breath in the slaughter-house? Most probably the death-machine, once started, will not limit itself to murdering Jews. At present, the specter of deat h in steam chambers rises before the Polish population; there have already been some signs of it: according to a report of an eyewitness, the Germans exterminated a group of Poles in death-house No.1, in the second half of August.” On August 8, 1943, The New York Times reported, referring to an article that appeared in a London newspaper: “ 2,000,000 Murders by Nazis Charged. Polish Paper in London says Jews Are Ex terminated in Treblinka Death House. ” The subtitle reads: “ According to report, steam is used to kill men, women and children at a place in the woods. ” The article was based upon a contribution published on August 7 th in the magazine Polish Labor Fights , which was nothing other than the report of November 15, 1942. This is indu- bitably clear from the quotes in the NYT article. 133 In 1944, Rabbi Silberschein published an eight-page report about the camp “ Tremblinki ” (a garbling of Treblinka). Although many features suggest that the source for this report is mainly the same as the one of November 15, 1942, it also contains many new elements, especially in relation to the killing tech- nique, which probably stem from a different source.

On the one hand, S ilberschein speaks of “ gas cham- bers ” and of “ gas, which flows out of pipes ,” while on the other hand he says that the bodies “ under the influence of the water vapor ” had been clumped to- gether. Thus, either Silberschein (correctly) regarded water vapor as a gas or he was not certain of the killing technique. The occurrence of many improper lingu istic expressions is explained by the fact that it has been translated fro m the French by a person not fully in command of German. It reads as follows: 135 “Tremblinki – The Main Extermination Camp The small village of Tremblinki lies on the Warsaw-Bialostock [sic] rail line. The main exterminati on camp, three times as large as that of Lublin, was located not far from the village. It was at first set up as a concentra- tion camp for Jews and Poles; but in March 1942, the Germans trans- formed it into an extermination camp for Jews only. They reconstructed the camp expressly for this and equipped it with gas experimental rooms and ovens. The Camp The camp was situated in the mids t of dense forests, entirely cut off from the outside world, and was reachable by means of a railway track with the Warsaw-Bialostock main line. It encompassed an area of 100 acres and is surrounded by the thickest barbed wire. It consisted of three sections: the ac tual camp; the extermination camp, and an open square. The actual camp has three blocks: a men’s camp, a women’s camp, and between these two a children’s camp. [136] A three-meter wide anteroom divides the inside of each block into two parts. From the anteroom doors open into the cells. Each cell measures 36 m 2 with a height of no more than two meters [... 137 ] . Each structure was 40 × 50 M in size. Aside from this, tw o more long-stretched buildings, each about 120 × 150 M in size, were constr ucted later as a men’s camp (not shown in the plan). The extermination facilities took up approximately the same space as the accommodation spaces and contained a dressing room (see plan). The dressing room contained a reception room for the camp administration, an anteroom, and the actual undressing room. The entrance to the dressing room was from the open square. A door led from the dressing room to the baths, from here a door led to the experimental chamber for gases of suffo-   134 In his book Belzec, Treblinka, Sobibor (note 72), which is accepted as the standard work, Yitzhak Arad does not devote one word to this report. 135 A.

The ovens were connected with a railway, which led to the cemetery (see plan). A large pedestal had been erected on the open square. There were al- most no workshops and only a few job positions in this camp. The Guard Service – The Treatment An SS detachment under the command of Hauptmann Sauer supplied the guard service in the extermination camp of Tremblinki. The composi- tion of the staff of the detachment changed frequently. The inmates performed various ta sks in connection with the require- ments of the camp. They were terribly maltreated and abused at this and had to endure the most inhuman punishments imaginable for every pettiest violation of the house rules or other mi stake. Not all worked, most of them waited in the cells only so long until the gassing facility was able to take them. But sometimes they were killed even sooner in another manner. The Germans shot several Jews on a daily basis, above all the Kommandant Sauer himself. Every afternoon he ha d his executioners assemble the Jews who still remained alive. Then he a sked: ‘Who is weak, who can no longer work?’ The Jews made no answer at all to this: whoever had had enough simply stepped forward from the line – and was shot down. In this manner, Hauptmann Sauer had murdered 500 Jewish y ouths, one after the other, on a single day in the beginning of September 1942. The ‘Kapus’ The ‘Kapus’ occupied a special position. It was these Jews upon whom many important mechanisms of the ca mp were imposed. Most Kapus had sorted through the clothing of those who had been transported out of this life. They did this task at a place called the ‘rag sorting place.’ Others were also working at the ra ilway station with the reception of those freshly arriving. Others, again, had to work as gravediggers. It hap- pened not rarely that the Jews so occ upied lasted no longer than two weeks and committed suicide. The Delivery Day after day two trains arrived in Tremblinki, completely filled with Jews. Jews were carried off from all parts of Europe to this place; but the main contingent was made up of the Jews from Warsaw, north Poland, and the Baltic. Every train was 30 to 50 cars long. The emptying of the cars proceeded at lightning pace. Then the Kapus received the arrivals and read to them the camp regulations in the Jewish language. At the station building, the following appeal was displayed: ‘Ha ve no concern about your fate! You are all traveling only to work in the east. You yourselves will perform the"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 60 work and your women will do the housework. Before traveling on, you have to bathe and remove the germs fr om your clothes. Gold and other valuables are to be deposited at the counter, where you will get a receipt for them.’ And really, in order to lull the belief in these promises into a feeling of security, the Germans had est ablished an office at the train sta- tion, where each new arrival had to turn up and report his professional training. After fulfillment of these ‘statistics,’ the people were brought into the camp and at first only sent into the disinfection baths. After the bath they were temporarily sent to th e individual cells. There they were sup- posed to wait until it was their turn. Bu t for the most part, those instructed didn’t know what fate awaited them . They still believed that they would soon be traveling on to a place of work. This belief was even strengthened by the fact that there were no large fact ory facilities in the camp and that it had all seemed as if it were only a transit station. The Murder Work But when the rooms could no longer a ccept new arrivals, the oldest in- mates were gassed. Every day groups of a thousand people each were brought into the gas and oven chambers. At first, as at their arrival, they were led into the bath by the Kapus. Everyone had to take off clothing and shoes and remained naked. For the furt her deception of the victims, each was handed a little piece of soap. In the meantime, the work of putting the discarded clothing and shoes in order was performed. Hauptmann Sauer took them over in the reception room of the extermination facilities. He did not miss any opportunity to flog every single person. Then the Germans drove the women and children as the fi rst ones into the extermination cells. Now the final act of the extermination began: Men and women, old people and child ren, all naked, take their last walk into death. At the fore stride the women and children, then the men, old and young, follow behind. To impel them to run faster, the Germans strike them on head and body. Now the victims are running, tormented by fear: their cries of dread, especially those of the women and children, as- cend to the sky. Now everybody knows where this is leading – into death. The floor is slippery, one slips and falls . But the falling c an no longer even stand up; for continually new victims a re flung over them. The children are thrown into the room, above the heads of their mothers. The extermination cells fill up. When they are full, then they are hermetically sealed, from every side the pipes open, out of wh ich flows gas. The death of asphyxia- tion reaps a quick harvest. Within a quarter hour it is all over. Then the Kapus must go to work. With pitil ess blows, the guard personnel force them to perform their work."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Chapter II: The Development of the Idea of Treblinka as an Extermination Camp 61 The gates of death open – but the dead bodies somehow cannot be pulled out individually: for they have all clumped together with one an- other and stiffened under the influence of the water vapor. Water is fetched from a nearby well and the bodies are sprinkled with it so the gravediggers can carry away the corpses. These are loosened by it, one from the other, and it is easier to remove them. Their appearance has not changed, aside from a violet coloration of the head and the back side [sic] . Now the dead are loaded onto the ramp, conducted over a railway to the cemetery in the mass graves, where the Kapus bring their task to an end. (See almost identical description in the article by Tymon Terlecki ‘Alle Juden raus,’ cite d by us on page 18 in ‘L’extermination des Juifs polonais IV’). [138] By many hundred thousands, Jews fr om all regions of Europe have been exterminated in this way in Tremblinki alone. The Camp Orchestra But the camp of Tremblinki had anoth er ‘specialty.’ To wit, the Jewish Arthur Gold Orchestra (see plan) gave concerts there, and it had the duty of playing for those who were being led to their death!!!! At the same mo- ment as thousands of Jews were perish ing in the gas chambers, the musi- cians had to play cheerful melodies. Whichever of them refused to do it was hanged up by his feet with his head down. Several of the musicians were seized by madness in the middle of playing. The artists, one after the other, jumped willy-nilly amongst th e crowd of people who were waiting for their turn, and they bellowed with voice breaking and face madly dis- torted ‘Frait och, yidelach, ir got zu m tot mit klezemer!’ (Enjoy yourselves, you Jews, you are going to death with music). Then the German bullets whizzed, and they sank under them to become a lifeless lump on the ground. After this the orchestra was brought up to strength again and the performance was repeated every time.” In a report dealing with alleged German crimes in Poland, authored by the Polish government for the Nuremberg Court and presented by the Soviets as Document USSR-93, the following is written regarding Treblinka: 139    138 This is an article which appeared on November 7, 1943, in no. 45 of the political newspaper Wiadomosci Polskie , published in London, in which Tym on Terlecki quoted longer sections from the already cited report of November 15, 1942. 139 USSR-93, English version.

Significance of the Report of November 15, 1942, for Historiography The report of November 15, 1942, is the most important historical source about the Treblinka camp during the time of its existence, and the entire sub- sequent official historiography relies on this report, beginning with the de- scription of the alleged ‘gas chambers.’ Nevertheless, it causes official histori- ans a miserable headache so that they occasionally cite it with blatant falsifi- cation. The Israeli historian Yitzhak Arad summarizes it as follows: 143 “In this document there is a description of the construction of the Treb- linka extermination camp, its location, its size, and a detailed plan, includ- ing a sketch of the area. This report also includes a description of the doz- ens [sic] of new gas chambers and other st ructures in the camp. With re- gard to the camp staff, it states that, in addition to the Germans and Ukrainians there are also Jews, whom the document calls ‘Jewish auxilia- ries’, who are employed at ancillary wo rks, in sorting of clothes of the murdered and removing the corpses fr om the gas chambers and burying    140 PS-3311, IMT , Volume XXXII, pp. 154-158.

The document mentions th e extremely difficult conditions under which the prisoners are kept, the daily killings among these Jews, and that their life expectancy in this camp wa s no more than two weeks. In the de- scription of the way the transports were treated, there is reference to the deceptive plays of the Germans and a description of the extermination process from the moment the people disembarked on the platform – the way they were tortured – until they were led into the gas chambers, as well as the system of burying the corpses. In conclusion, it stated that by then two million Jews had been murdered in Treblinka – the majority of Polish Jewry. The report concludes by asking why the new gas chambers were built, since indeed the majority of Polish Jewry had already been killed, and states that, according to one eyewitness, the Germans had already killed a group of Poles in the middle of August. This report is the first in which th ere is a comprehensive description of the Treblinka extermination camp. The facts are, fo r the most part, correct. Their source is escapees from the camp who reached the Warsaw ghetto and who gave testimony for the Ringelblum Archive and to Jewish Under- ground groups in the Warsaw ghetto. Th is report is based therefore on the descriptions of witnesses who had seen for themselves the process of ex- termination, who had lived in the ca mp for days or weeks as prisoners, who had been employed at various jobs, and who had succeeded in escap- ing. The facts that they related on the basis of what they had seen were ac- curate, but the reference to two million Jews murdered was incorrect. In the period to which this report refers, one-fourth to one-third of the num- ber cited in the report had been mu rdered. Also the detail about the mur- der of a group of Poles in Treblinka was incorrect.” The coarse falsifications, of which Arad , regarded by the official historio- graphy as the most renowned Treblinka expert, becomes guilty here, makes one imagine his mortal embarrassment in the face of this historical source of such unusual importance – a source, howev er, which indeed contradicts one of the main pillars of precisely this official historiography by the fact that it men- tions as the murder weapon not any diesel gas chambers, but instead water va- por chambers. Y. Arad claims, though, that the report contains “ a description of the doz- ens of new gas chambers ” as well as a description of the “ process of extermi- nation ,” but does not write so much as a single syllable about the steam cham- bers, but rather he shamelessly transforms them into “ gas chambers ”! Fur- thermore, he asserts that the facts are “ for the most part, correct ” and that the witness testimony was “ accurate ,” although the official historiography long since banished the steam chambers to the realm of myths."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 64 The Polish historian Józef Marsza ł ek furnishes a summary, which is not any less dishonest when he writes: 144 “In this section [of the report] the site and topography of the camp are exactly shown, and the number of the gas chambers [145] as well as their structure with the facilities for the gassing [146] of the victims are de- scribed.” We now turn to the question of how the miraculous transformation of the steam chambers into gas chambers occurred. 4. From Steam Chambers to Carbon Monoxide Chambers In August 1944, the Soviets occupied the area around Treblinka and con- ducted a military forensic investigati on with examination of the camp grounds as well as witness interviews. 147 The murder method most frequently men- tioned by witness at the latter was di fferent again from those already men- tioned and consisted of the evacuation of air from hermetically sealed rooms by means of a vacuum pump driven by an engine. This engine, which at first was merely used to run the pump, gradually transmogrified into a murder weapon – at first still in connection with the evacuation of air, before it then, thanks above all to Jankiel Wiernik, became the single instrument of killing, by which the victims were killed with carbon monoxide gas. The murder technique of suffocation by pumping out the air was described in particular by two witnesses. The Jew Abe Kon, former Treblinka prisoner, stated on August 17, 1944: 148 “I was sent into the Treblinka camp in October 1942 with my relatives – father, mother, two sisters, a brother. [...] The naked people walking by were struck by whips. They were walk ing to a building, which had been nicely built with cement. A Jewish symbol, the ‘Star of David,’ was at- tached to the house. At th e entrance to the ‘bath’ stood a Ukrainian with a knife and whip.

The service staff named this Ukrainian ‘Ivan the Terrible.’ Plan of the ‘Bath’: the bath consiste d of 12 cabins. Each cabin meas- ured 6 × 6 m. The height amounted to 2.5 m. In one cabin they drove 600 people each. They threw the children on their heads. The cabins had two doors, which could be sealed hermetically. In the corner between ceiling and wall two openings were connected with hoses. Behind the ‘bath’ stood a machine. It pumped the air out of the chambers. The people suffocated within 6 to 15 minutes. The second door was opened and the people were dragged out. The teeth were examined and golden teeth were ripped out. From thence the bodies were carried away on stretchers and were buried in the ground. They weren’t buried any farther than 100 m away from the ‘bath.’ People were driven into the ‘bath’ three times a day. In this way 15,000 to 18,000 persons were destroye d each day. That’s how it went for two months. Later, machines dug these bodies up and they were cremated in ovens. There were no fewer than one million burned. Later, the extermination process proceeded as follows: suffocation and burning. They were incinerated in a specially manufactured oven, which could hold up to 6,000 bodies. The oven was filled with corpses. Gasoline or petroleum was poured over them and burned. The cremation lasted up to an hour. [...] Those who could not walk to the ‘bath’ – invalids, old people – were sent to the ‘hospital’; th ey went there. They were placed at the edge of a deep pit on whose bo ttom was a pyre made up of human be- ings. The victims got a shot in the back of the neck, whereupon they fell into the pit and burned. So it went, day after day.” On August 22, 1944, the Pole Kazmierz Skarzy ń ski gave the following statement: 149 “Incarcerated Jews in the camp reported that many hundred prisoners at a time were penned in hermetica lly sealed chambers and were asphyxi- ated by pumping out the air. The people died very quickly – in 10 or 12 minutes. According to the stories of the Jews, the oven [sic] was a pit of 25 m in length, 20 m wide and 5-6 m deep, with a grate made out of train rails on the bottom of the pit, which constituted an air vent. The bodies were piled on the rails and burned. The glow from the fire was visible at a dis- tance of 15 km. During the day a black smoke spread. In a strong wind, the smell of burning was still perceptib le 30 km from the camp.” The air evacuation technique of killing al so turns up in the first official So- viet report concerning Treblinka I and II. It originates from August 24, 1944. Regarding Treblinka it is reported: 150    149 GARF, 7021-115-11, p. 16. 150 GARF, 7021-115-9, p. 108."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 66 “The ‘bath’ was a house that consisted of 12 cabins each 6 × 6m in size.

In the corner, between ceiling and wall, there were two openings connected with hoses. Behind the ‘bath’ stood a machine. It pumped the air out of the room. The people suffocated in 6 to 10 minutes. The second door was opened and the dead were brought in wheel barrows to the special ovens.” On September 15, 1944, a Polish-Soviet commission composed a “ protocol of a provisional preliminary investigati on and inquiry into the former concen- tration camp Tremblinka ” [sic], where we read: 151 “In the beginning, the method was employed of pumping the air out of the room by means of a small car en gine. Then, as a result of the large number of the doomed, a chemical substance began to be used.” Wassili Grossmann entered Treblinka in September and spoke with the witnesses who were also questioned by th e Soviet investigatory commission at that time. As he writes in his book, he reconstructed the picture of Treblinka “ according to the stories of living witnesses ,” the “ statements of people who have worked in Treblinka from the first day of the establishment of the camp until August 2, 1943 .” 152 Grossmann, however, declared that he was not satis- fied with copying the contradictory st atements of these witnesses, but at- tempted to connect them into a coherent historical portrayal: 153 “In the beginning, even the pressure and suction devices functioned poorly, the suffering of the unfortunates at that time dragged on for eight to ten hours. The most diverse means were employed for killing: the ex- haust gases of a heavy armored tank engine, which served the power sta- tion of Treblinka, were forced in. [...] The second most often used proce dure in Treblinka was the pumping out of the air from the chambers with the help of special suction equipment – the causes of death were approximately similar to those in the poisoning with carbon monoxide gas: the oxyg en supply for the people was blocked. And, finally, the third method, rarer but likewise employed, the murdering by steam, which was also based upon denying oxygen to the organism: the steam forced the air out of the room . Various toxic gases were also used, but merely for experimental purposes; the factory-scale mass murder was carried out in the manner describe d in the first two procedures men- tioned.” At the end of 1945, on the occasion of their questioning by the Polish ex- amining judge Z. Ł ukaszkiewicz, the Treblinka witnesses were still uncertain    151 GARF, 7021-115-11, p. 44. 152 Wassili Grossmann, Die Hölle von Treblinka , in: Die Vernichtungslager Maidanek und Treblinka , op. cit.

In a statement given between October and December, witness Szymon Goldberg described the following method of killing in the “ gassing cabins ” of Treblinka: 154 “The Jews were poisoned in that the air was pumped out – there was a machine for pumping out the air – and gas [ i.e. , exhaust fumes] of a vehi- cle were introduced. Ether was burned and this vapor introduced inside. Then there was also chlorine.” On October 12, 1945, witness Henryk Reichmann put on record: 42 “The killings were carried out either by pumping out of the air or by in- troduction of CO. Once, when fewer transports were arriving, the Germans conducted an experiment: They pumped out the air without introducing poison. When the doors were opened after 48 hours, we found some living people inside.” The statement of the witness Stanis ł aw Kon of October 7, 1945, was simi- lar in content: 155 “The killing took place by means of pumping out the air or by introduc- tion of engine exhaust gases.” In January 1946, Rachel Auerbach, member of the Jewish Central Histori- cal Commission, published her book that has already been mentioned, which was then issued in English under the title In the Fields of Treblinka in 1979 by Alexander Donat. There, the manner of f unctioning of the gas chambers is de- scribed as follows: 156 “The motor, installed in a workshop near the bathhouse, could be started now. First, a suction pump was brought into play to draw the pure air from the chamber. After that, the pipe to the reservoir of exhaust gas from the motor could be opened. [...] At the last moment, it seems, when the pump started to suck out breathable air, all self-control bro ke and there was an outbreak of collec- tive hysteria inside the gas chamber.” A succinct example of the hopeless conf usion, which then prevailed among the eyewitnesses with respect to the met hod employed in Treblinka for the ex- termination of Jews, are the statements of Samuel Rajzman. Rajzman, charac- terized by A. Donat as “ nestor of the Treblinka survivors ,” 157 was questioned on September 26, 1944, by the military examining judge of the military prose- cutor’s office of the 65th Soviet Army, First Lieutenant of Justice Jurowski.

Yet he reported the following: 158 “Dr. Horonschitzki likewise had no adm ittance into the cabins, but of what was known to him, he told me the following: the people were driven in large parties into the cabins of th e so-called ‘baths.’ These cabins were hermetically sealed. In the first p eriod, the killing occurred by means of pumping out the air from the cabins; then one resorted to other methods – poisoning by chlorine gas and Cylon-gas. On the camp territory there was a special store of materials with a large amount (up to 15 tons) of so- called Chloren. Externally, Chloren was constituted of blocks white in color. Every day before my eyes, barrels of this Chloren were carried into the second division. I did not see containers with Cyclon, but rarely and periodically various crates arrived wi th the transports, which were taken over by the guard staff of the 2 nd division without delay. The engines in the ‘bath rooms’ ran 24 hours without interruption. Whether poisoning by means of gas mist occurred, I have not heard.” A month beforehand, in August, Rajz man had written a 16-page report en- titled Kombinat Smerti v Treblike (death factory in Treblinka ) , 159 in which he depicts the method of extermination in Treblinka as follows: 160 “After being sheared, the women were sent into the ‘bathing establish- ment,’ which consisted of a row of c hambers, each of which could hold 700 persons. In the chambers towels w ere hanging, and there was a sign posted with the inscription ‘Rules for using the bath’! The people were led in, and the doors were hermetically sealed. In the beginning, the method of pump- ing out the air was employed: under fri ghtful torments the people died the death of asphyxiation. As time went by, the Germans switched to poisoning with gas, which went more rapidly. Ea ch group stayed in the chamber from 12 to 20 minutes, no longer, for ma sses of new arrivals were waiting for their turn in the ‘bath.’ After twenty minutes, the bodies were already afire on an enormous pyre. It happened that out of the fire desperate lamenta- tion sounded. The Germans paid no attention to it – an expression of the ‘extraordinary German tenderheart edness.’ There were instances when one of the Germans delivered the coup de grâce to one of those thrown alive into the fire. Before the bodies fe ll into the fire, they were examined by a group of ‘dentists’, who checked whether perhaps there were teeth, crowns, or fillings of gold present; all this was torn from the mouth of the dead by pliers.    158 USSR-337, p. 9 of the German version. 159 This notice is mentioned in the report, wh ich was written on August 24, 1944, by representa- tives of the 65th Soviet Army.

The workers at the ovens [sic] were changed every few days, and only rarely did one remain more than a week long at this ‘work.’ They were replaced by a fresh labor force, which day after day came in with the new trains. As ‘r eward’ for working off these days, these prisoners were not sent into the ‘bath,’ but were killed instead by a shot to the back of the neck.” At the Nuremberg Trial, where he stood in the witness stand on February 27, 1946, Rajzman merely spoke of the “ gas chambers ” without going into any closer detail about their structure or the type of gas used. 161 In the same year, thus 1946, Rajzman composed an eight-page report with the title Mój pobyt w Treblince (My stay in Treblinka). 162 Here, he claimed that 25,000 people per day had been murdered in Treblinka, 163 but did not elaborate on the method/s of killing. By the 1950s, Rajzman had happily attached himself to the official version of the ‘gas chambers,’ but remained perf ectly silent about the details. In his report, published in English by A. Donat, he contents himself with the follow- ing remarks: 164 “The women had to line up, and all their hair was clipped off. It was destined for use in German mattresses. Naked, they went the road of no re- turn, into the gas chambers. While they undressed and walked into the gas chambers, the Germans hit them very har d; many died from the beatings alone. Everybody was pushing to get to the gas chamber fast, because the Ukrainians and the Germans were be ating them so hard. Everybody was stampeding forward. The whole place was covered with blood. People didn’t know that it would be the end there; the idea was simply to get out of the place where they were beating you. And in doing that, they went straight into the gas chambers.” In these few sentences, Rajzman thus mentions the ‘gas chambers’ four times, but spares not a word as to their structure and manner of functioning.    161 IMT , Vol. VIII, pp. 324-329. 162 Wydawnictwo Centralnej Ż ydowskiej Komisji Historycznej (ed.), Dokumenty i Materia ł y , op. cit.

Origin of the Version of Carbon Monoxide Gas Chambers Let us summarize: at the end of 1945, three different methods of mass murder were still contending for first pl ace: steam, evacuation of air, and en- gine exhaust. As mentioned, the Polis h government gave preference to steam at the Nuremberg Trial and thereby conferred upon this method the official consecration of being an ‘historical fact.’ In what was to follow, this ‘histori cal fact’ was declared a myth, and the steam had to defer to the exhaust gases of a diesel engine. What was the origin of this version? And why did the latter ultimately pre- vail? The claim that in Treblinka murder was committed by engine exhaust was already fleetingly surfacing (without an indication as to the type of engine) in the year 1942, but soon vanished into ob livion again. It was again picked up and enlarged upon by Jankiel Wiernik. By his own testimony, Wiernik was deported to Treblinka on August 23, 1942 , and remained there until August 2, 1943, the day of the prisoner uprising. In May 1944 he published a report about Treblinka in the Polish language, which was published in English trans- lation in the USA that same year. 165 Wiernik has the following to report about the first gassing facilities: 166 “When I arrived at the camp, three gas chambers were already in op- eration; another ten were added while I was there. A gas chamber meas- ured 5 × 5 meters and was about 1.90 meters high. The outlet on the roof had a hermetic cap. The chamber was e quipped with a gas pipe inlet and a baked tile floor slanting towards the platform. The brick building which housed the gas chambers was separated from Camp No. 1 by a wooden wall. This wood wall and the brick wa ll of the building together formed a corridor, which was 80 centimeters tall er than the building. The chambers were connected with the corridor by a hermetically fitted iron door leading into each of the chambers. On the si de of Camp No. 2 the chambers were connected by a platform four meters wide, which ran alongside all three chambers. The platform was about 80 centimeters above ground level. There was also a hermetically fitted wooden door on this side. Each chamber had a door facing Ca mp No. 2 (1.80 by 2.50 meters), which could be opened onl y from the outside by lifting it with iron supports and was closed by iron hooks set into the sash frames, and by wooden bolts. The victims were led into the chambers through the doors leading    165 R. Czarkowski, Cieniom Treblinki , op. cit.

The power plant operated alongside these chambers, supplying Ca mps 1 and 2 with electric current. A motor taken from a dismantled Soviet tank stood in the power plant. This motor was used to pump the gas into the chambers by connecting the motor with the inflow pipes. The speed w ith which death overcame the helpless victims depended on the quantity of combustion gas admitted into the chamber at one time. [...] Between 450 and 500 persons were cro wded into a chamber measuring 25 square meters. [ 167 ...] The chamber was filled, th e motor turned on and connected with the inflow pipes, and, wi thin 25 minutes at the most, all lay stretched out dead or, to be more accurate, were standing up dead.” There is no mention in any other w itness testimony of the two additional gas chambers, and official historiography also knows nothing of them. A few pages later, Wiernik gets into the details of the new gassing facili- ties: 168 “The new construction job between Camp No. 1 and Camp No. 2, on which I had been working, was complete d in a very short time. It turned out that we were building ten additional gas chambers, more spacious than the old ones, 7 by 7 meters or about 50 square meters. [169] As many as 1,000 to 1,200 persons could be crowded into one gas chamber. The build- ing was laid out according to the corridor system, with five chambers on each side of the corridor. Each chamber had two doors, one door leading into the corridor through which the victims were admitted; the other door, facing the camp, was used for the remov al of the corpses. The construction of both doors was the same as that of the doors in the old chambers. The building, when viewed from Camp No. 1, showed five wide concrete steps with bowls of flowers on either side. Next came a long corridor. There was a Star of David on top of the roof facing the camp, so that the building looked like an old-fashioned synagogue. [...] The motor that generated the gas in the new chambers was defective, and so the helpless victims had to su ffer for hours on end before they died. [...] When the chambers were opened agai n, many of the victims were only half dead and had to be finished off w ith rifle butts, bullets or powerful kicks.” Two important elements make it possible for us to progress to the origin of this version of the extermination method in Treblinka: the camp plan pub- lished by Wiernik and his reference to the “ power plant ” which “ operated    167 That would be 18 to 20 victims per square meter! 168 A.

In reality, he quite simply copied the plan, which was encl osed with the report about the steam chambers dating from November 15, 19 42 (see Document 2 in the Appendix). Both plans bear the same designation: “ Treblinka. Szkic orientacyjny ” (Treb- linka, orientation sketch); 170 both depict the same map legends; 171 and, on both, the facilities are numbered 1 through 26, which indeed is explained in the report of November 15, 1942, but not, however, in Wiernik‘s exposition. The first three “ extermination chambers ,” which in the report of November 15, 1942, are called “ steam chambers ,” but in that of Wiernik are called “ gas chambers ,” are designated by the number 14 in both plans. Correspondingly, a boiler room for the production of steam is represented by number 15a in the report of November 15, 1942, and in Wier nik‘s plan it is a gassing engine. In addition, the description of the two gassi ng installations – the first with three and the second with ten chambers – fully and completely corresponds to the report of November 15, 1942, and to the camp plan which was enclosed with it! Precisely for the reason that it is the fruit of plagiarism, Wiernik‘s sketch has a paucity of features of this kind: not only are many buildings of the camp missing, but also the cremation grills, although he wrote his report in the year 1944. Wiernik ‘rectified’ his error only in 1945 by furnishing a new, ‘cor- rected’ plan of Treblinka. If one compares th is with that of the year before, the plagiarism shows up even more glaringly. 172 On the occasion of Session 66 of the Jerusalem Eichmann Trial, Wiernik produced the plan from 1945, which entered the records as Document T-1300, yet mendaciously claimed to have drawn it in the year 1943. 173 Thus it is clear that Wiernik quite simply plagiarized the plan of the report of November 15 and in doing so replaced the word “ steam chambers ” with “ gas chambers ”. Why did he do this? Presumably he was of the opinion – and to be sure with good reason – that the th en current versions of mass murders in Treblinka were too simpleminded. On th e other hand, the idea of the engine compellingly suggested itself.    170 On both plans the word Treblinka is underlined by a broken line. 171 In the map legend of Wiernik, under Point 3 is printed, instead of “ parkan ” (fence) the syno- nym “ plot .” 172 See Document 5 in the Appendix.

Every concentration camp possessed such equipment. Even camps with connection to the local electric supply were equipped with an emergency power supply. This was all the more so for those which – like Treblinka – were not connected to the local electric supply. Thus, in Treb- linka, the electric power supply was no emergency device but rather the actual plant for supplying the camp with the electricity necessary for its functioning, and consequently it had to be in opera tion 24 hours a day. The generator of such a power supply was usually driven by a diesel engine. In view of the im- portance of this engine, a special engi ne – naturally new – was normally em- ployed. How complex such an installa tion was regarded technically, emerges from, for example, the “ Kostenvoranschlag über Notstromanlage ” (Estimate for back-up power plant) which was pr epared for the concentration camp Auschwitz on November 10, 1940, by the firm of Georg Grabarz, Master Electrician, from Gleiwitz. 174 We shall return of this later. Where was the power plant located in Treblinka? As we have seen, Wiernik claimed that it had been installed by the first “ gassing house .” This is also claimed by Rajzman, who reports: “The engines in the ‘bath rooms’ ran 24 hours without interruption.” The supposed homicidal chambers are meant by the “ bath rooms ”. That one or more engines are supposed to have been in operation “ 24 hours without interruption ” cannot be explained on the basis of requirements for an extermi- nation program, in which such engi nes would have run only a few hours a day, but solely by the necessity of producing electricity for the camp around the clock. That the story of the engine exhaust gas chambers lacks any kind of basis in reality and is nothing else but a pr opaganda fairy tale, is shown beyond doubt by Wiernik‘s description of the corpses of the alleged gassing vic- tims: 175 “All were equal. There was no longer any beauty or ugliness, for they all were yellow from the gas.” Relying upon the statements of th ree eyewitnesses, Rachel Auerbach writes: 176 “The bodies were naked; some of them were white, others were blue and bloated.” As a matter of fact, the victims of carbon monoxide poisoning exhibit a cherry-red or rosy red coloring. 177 This is caused by carboxy-hemoglobin, which forms as a reaction of carbon monoxide with hemoglobin in the blood.    174 RGVA, 502-1-128, pp. 45-49, see Document 21 in the Appendix. 175 A.

In this one reads: 178 “As in other cases, so also in this one, a document is produced first- hand, which describes the conditions and crimes in Treblinka. It originates from one who had been a prisoner, who succeeded in escaping from the camp. It was Yankiel Wieznik [sic] , a Jewish master builder, who spent a year in Treblinka. He produced a report about Treblinka which, as he sug- gests in his preface, co mprises the sole meaning of his continuing to live on.” 179 In this report, however, the Polish g overnment does not mention the killing method described by Wiernik – engine exhaust gases – with a single word, but speaks merely of steam and electricity. This means, of course, that they did not accept the reality of the gassings, but all the same did not want to do with- out a ‘first-class’ prosecution witness. Thus this strange compromise. At the Nuremberg Trial, Head Justice Counsel L.N. Smirnow, Assistant Prosecutor for the Soviet Union, took up this point of the Polish report at the presentation of the document USSR-93 (and garbled Wiernik‘s name even more badly): “On page 70 of the Russian text of this report, you find a passage from the statement of a carpenter from Warsaw, Jakob Vernik [sic] , a carpenter from Warsaw, who spent a year in the extermination camp of Treblinka 2. [...] This is what Vernik said in presenting a report on Treblinka to the Polish Government; a report which, as he stressed in his foreword, was his only reason ‘to continue his pitiful life:’” But in reality, no ‘report’ follows in the Soviet folder of documents, but merely the two citations from Wiernik‘ s writing, which appeared in the Polish document and which had been copied by Smirnov. 180 6. Triumph of the Version of Carbon Monoxide Gas Chambers Finally, the following question needs to be addressed: why and when did the carbon monoxide gas chambers prevail over the steam chambers?

The British-Jewish historian Gerald Reitlinger rightly com- ments about this: 181 “It is difficult to see how people could be exterminated by steam, [...] ” In fact, any kind of sauna would then indeed be a ‘steam extermination chamber’! This was doubtlessly the reason, why Examining Judge Z. Ł ukasz- kiewicz, in his report about Treblinka of December 29, 1945, jettisoned the most idiotic among the diverse murder methods claimed by the witnesses and retained merely those, which seemed most credible to him: namely the engine exhaust gases. 182 Yet initially, his report found little resonance. On the other hand, the so-called ‘Gerst ein Report’ attracted the interest of historians directly after its publica tion and became at once the ‘proof’ par ex- cellence for the existence of the alleged ‘extermination camp’ Be łż ec (as well as secondarily of the ‘extermination ca mp’ Treblinka). The Gerstein Report proved to be decisive for historiography regarding the choice of the murder weapon – diesel exhaust gases – for the three alleged ‘extermination camps’ of Be łż ec, Treblinka, and Sobibór. Thus, the report of the Polish government was seen as totally unworthy of belief, for this mentioned a killing method for Be łż ec, which was scarcely less absurd than the ‘steam chambers ’ of Treblinka: electric current: 183 “Under the pretext that they were bei ng led into the bath, the Jews were completely undressed and herded into the building. Through the floor of this building flowed a strong electric current; thousands of human beings were killed here.” In the session of February 19, 1946, Smirnov recited the following passage from the report of the Polish government (Document USSR-93): 184 “ [...] in the last paragraph on Page 136 of the document book, we may read that Camp Belsen [185] was founded in 1940; but it was in 1942 that the special electrical appliances were built in for mass extermination of peo- ple. Under the pretext that the people were being led to the bath-house, the doomed were undressed and then driven to the building where the floor was electrified in a special way; there they were killed.”    181 Gerald Reitlinger, The Final Solution.

Yet this text yellowed for decades in an archive 187 and moved into the spotlight only during the Demjan- juk Trial. 188 In 1951, Léon Poliakov made use of the ‘Gerstein Report’ 189 in order to give substance to the rumor of the ‘extermination camps’ in Poland. He quoted a long excerpt from it and concluded as follows: 190 “There is little to add to this descri ption, which holds good for Treb- linka and Sobibor as well as for th e Belzec camp. The latter installations were constructed in almost the very sa me way, and also used the exhaust carbon monoxide gases from Diesel motors as the death agent.” Two years later, Gerald Reitlinger took up Poliakov‘s claims in his work The Final Solution , 191 which rapidly became the classic of official historio- graphy and thereby ultimately asserted diesel exhaust gases as the extermina- tion method in the ‘eastern extermination camps.’ 192 Therefore it is owed mainly to the ‘Gerstein Report’ that Treblinka, just like Be łż ec and Sobibór, received its diesel engine, and the steam chambers were banished to the junk yard of history. By means of this propaganda maneuver, official historiography raised the carbon monoxide chambers of Treblinka (as well as of the two other ‘eastern extermination camps’) at last to the status of ‘certain historical fact.’    186 USSR-93, p. 42.

Soviet Investigations and Forensic Examinations In the middle of August 1944, the 65th Soviet Army conquered the region around Treblinka. The Military Examining Judge of the Military Office of Prosecution First Lieutenant of Justice Jurowski went to work immediately, supported by other officers – Major Kononjuk, Major V.S. Apresjan, First Lieutenant F.A. Rodionov, Major M.E. Golovan, and Lieutenant N.V.

Three mass graves and 13 individua l graves were discovered by this. The exhumation of the bodies yielded the following picture: 1. Grave 10 m × 5 m × 2 m in dimension, with 105 bodies, which had been buried in layers of 5 to 7 each. Upon each layer of bodies, a layer of earth 45 to 50 cm thick had been piled. 194 2.

From all na- tions of Europe occupied by the Germans, the entire Jewish population was brought here for burning, besides many ‘unfit’ people of other natio- nalities. The death factory, in which the SS-men ruthlessly and zealously exterminated millions of people, was in operation around the clock for 13 months, from July 1942 until September 1943. This diabolical undertaking ceased to exist only after the pr isoner revolt in the Jewish camp. Dozens of witnesses attest to have seen how up to three transports of Jews, with 60 cars each, arrived in th e camp on a daily basis. The trains left the camp either loaded with sand or empty. Martyrs of the camp who were left with their lives tell that they were de- livered in railway cars in which th ere were 150, 180, or even 200 persons each. While traveling they were dying of hunger. There was no water. They drank urine. [...] At the railway branch line at T reblinka there was so mething in the camp which resembled a fine train stati on; the length of the platform was reckoned for 20 cars. All special buildings, where people were murdered, were carefully camouflaged on the outside as beautiful facilities. The ave- nues were sprinkled with sand and bor dered by flowers, garden beds and fir trees – all this in ord er to deceive the ‘passengers.’ [...] Some persons, who escaped the pyre th rough a miracle, have portrayed the nightmarish images of th e incineration of people: The Jews delivered to the camp were received by the SS-unit. The men were led to a special square, but the women and children were taken to the barracks. Beautiful and young Jewesses we re taken by the Germans for themselves for a night. All men, wome n, and children were told to undress. The women’s hair was shorn and it was sent to Germany as raw material. The clothes were sorted and likewise sent to Germany. The victims were ordered to take along valuables – gold, paper money, documents. The na- ked people were shown to a cashier’ s counter one by one, and they were told to deposit everything. After they had done this, they were allowed to go on and were led along the sand-strewn , flower-bordered avenue into the ‘bath,’ where they were given soap, a towel and underclothing. After de- positing of the valuables, already on the way to the ‘bath,’ the polite tone gave way to roughness. Those who w ere walking were urged on by rods and beaten with canes. The ‘bath’ was a house, which consisted of 12 cabins, each 6 × 6 m in size. 400 to 500 people were driven at a time into one cabin. It had two doors, which could be sealed hermetically. In the corner, between ceiling and wall, were two openings connected with hoses. Behind the ‘bath’ stood a machine. It pumped the air out of the room. The people suffocated within 6 to 10 minutes. The second door wa s opened and the dead were brought on wheelbarrows to the special ovens."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Chapter III: Investigations , Camp Plans, Statistics 79 In these, important scholars, physicians, teachers, musicians, the rela- tives of noted personalities were cremated. In such a way the sister of the famous psychiatrist Sigmund Freud, th e brother of the French Minister Sourez [?] and others were incinerated. (Witness testimony of Abe Kon, Hejnoch Brenner, Samuel Rajzman). A huge area of the camp was covered with cinders and ashes. The road, which connected the two camps and is three kilometers long, was covered with cinders and ashes to a height of 7 - 10 cm. One could recognize the presence of lime in large pieces of cind er with the naked eye. It is well known that lime is a product of bur ning bones. There were no production sites in the camp, but cinders and ashes were brought out of the camp every day by the ton. This freight was loaded onto railroad cars, and 20 to 30 peasant carts distributed them and poured them onto the road. (Witness testimony of Lucjan Pucha ł a, Kazimierz Skarzinski. Stanis ł aw Krym inter alia). The statements of the witnesses, th e book ‘One Year in Treblinka’ [by Jankiel Wiernik] , the presence of a large quantity of ashes and cinders, the presence of personal commodities and documents strewn on the grounds as well as excavated from the pits confir m that there were ovens in the camp where people were cremated. In the beginning, the Germans buried the bodies of the murdered. After Himmler had visited the camp, the bodies were dug up with an excavator and cremated. At the present it is difficult to unco ver the traces and secrets of this oven for the cremation of people, but based upon the available data, one can picture it. The oven – this was a large trench 250-300 m in length, 20-25 m in width and 5-6 m deep, excavated by an excavator. Driven into the bottom of the ditch were three rows of reinforced concrete posts, one-and-a-half m in height each. The posts were conn ected to one another by cross-beams. On these cross-beams rails were placed at intervals of 5 to 7 cm. That was a gigantic oven grill. A narrow-gage spur track led down to the edge of the trench. (Witness testimony of Abe Kon, Hejnoch Brenner, Samuel Rajzman, and the content of the book ‘One Year in Treblinka’). [...] The Germans attempted to delete the traces of their atrocities. After the revolt of the Jews they destroyed all ca mp buildings, which were still intact after the fire. Oats, rye, and lupi nes were now planted on the grounds of the former ‘death camp.’ What remai ns are the walls of the burned resi- dential building and of the cattle stall of the colonist Strebel, who was set- tled on the territory of the camp. Rema ining as marks of the existence of the camp are: an abatis of barbed wi re, ashes, cinders, and a great number of pits, where household objects of th e cremated Jews have been buried.” The report ends with six “ conclusions ,” of which the most important is the first:"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 80 “On the basis of the preliminary fact s, the cremation of people has been determined with no doubt. The extent of the extermination of people was monstrous: about three million.” On September 11, a “ Report of the front-line press TASS ” was compiled, which bore the title “ The Death Camp in Tremblinka” (sic). We reproduce the most significant excerpts: 198 “Tremblinka! At this word people t remble and look fearfully sideways. People who lived in the vicinity of T remblinka could not sleep at night: the screams of men, women, and children whom they were murdering ripped through the darkness. The stench pene trated from there. They were burn- ing people there. [...] Tremblinka – that is the same as Majdanek . It is one of the numerous factories of death, with which the Germans thickly covered the Polish soil. The ‘Tod-Lager’, [199] as the Germans themselves officially called it, [200] was established close to Tremb linka sometime in June 1942. [...] By the beginning of July, the first transport arrived, filled to the bursting point with people – with ‘living raw material,’ as the doomed were officially called. The camp gate opened with the sound of a lively march, and inside poured the stream of living people. From this point on, this stream was un- interrupted for two years. The voracious gate consumed up to two thou- sand people daily. [... 201 ] A fat Unterscharführer sent the human chain into the ‘bath.’ This was a low square room without windows, with a heavy en- trance door. A large hose, through which gas was carried, led into the ‘bath.’ The people were forcefully pushed into the ‘bath,’ the door was tightly closed with a steel bar, the Unterscharführer gave a signal, and the ‘bath-master’ switched on the machinery of death. In the beginning, the ‘bath’ had three compartments and could hold 1,200 people. The Germans, however, w ere not satisfied with this capacity, and they quickly constructed a new building three times bigger. Here there were 8 chambers and the bath could accommodate 4,800 people at a time. The people in the ‘bath’ died under horrible tortures after ten minutes. The ‘bath-master’ recorded this by means of a small glass window in the door. Here, every minute was costly – after all, thousands of other people were waiting their turn. For this reason, the ‘bath’ functioned with Ger- man thoroughness. Those for whom there was no room were beaten dead or flung onto the pyre alive. The corpses were retrieved from the ‘bath’ by a special squad; they were stacked upon rails which ran acro ss wide pits.

This was the final stage of the ‘proc- essing.’ The corpses were cremated and the human ashes were brought to Germany to fertilize fields. Even the roads inside the camp were sprinkled with it. [...] K. Egrov 1. Byelo-Russian Front September 12 Tass Special Correspondent” On the 15th of September, a Polish- Soviet commission, consisting of Mag- ister P. Sobolevski, the Secretary of the Polish-Soviet Commission for the Revelation of German Crimes, M. Chodzko, the representative of the informa- tion and propaganda department of a Po lish institute, as well as G.E. Levakov, the representative of the War Soviet of the 2nd Byelorussian Front, composed a “ protocol of a provisional prelimi nary investigation and reconnaissance in the former concentration camp Tremblinka ,” in which the recent investiga- tions of Soviet military justice were summarized, and from which we cite some excerpts: 202 “ [...] The site of Tremblinka lies 7 km from the railway junction of Ma ł kinia in the Sokolowski district. The German bandits put down a rail- way line to the place whe re the camp was located, in order to be able to bring the transports of prisoners direct ly and unnoticed into the concentra- tion camp. [...] The concentration camp Tremblinka consisted of two sections, which were at a distance of one-and-a-half kilo meters from each other. The first section was named ‘Death Camp No. 2.’ This camp itself, on whose grounds two burned-down farm buildin gs can now be found, broke down into two parts, and a railroad track led to this Camp No. 2. Here, some- thing along the lines of a train station was constructed in order to disguise the actual mission – the extermination. A three-fold barbed wire abatis was camouflaged with tree branches. For this reason the people taken here be- lieved initially that they were at a transit point on their journey to the east. In the first section of Death Camp No. 2, the prisoners who had been delivered there had to undress. They we re instructed to deposit their cloth- ing at a certain place, and then the naked people were forced to run with arms raised in the direction of the so-called bath. This was only an appar- ent bath; it actually was a gas chamb er consisting of three rooms. In the beginning, the method of pumping the air out of the space by means of a small car engine was employed. Then , as a result of the great number of those destined for death, they began to use chemicals. About 400 people could be crowded in this space at a time. On the roof of this – hermetically sealable – building was a small window, through which the death struggle    202 GARF, 7021-115-11, pp. 43-47."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 82 of the dying could be observed. [...] Approximately 400 Jews worked at this chamber, who dragged out the corpses of the asphyxiated and threw them into enormous trenches, which were located in the area of Death Camp No. 2 and which had been pre pared beforehand and excavated by an excavator. In the winter of 1943, the German murderers proceeded to exhume and burn the corpses. For this purpose they also used an excavator. The per- sonal documents found here, torn into pieces and thrown away, prove that citizens of Poland, of the Soviet Union, of Czechoslovakia and other na- tions, members of the intelligentsia as well as simple workers, were killed here. The second section of the concentration camp was named ‘Camp No. 1’ and was located one-and-a-half kilometers away from the Death Camp. [...] The objects found bear witness to the fact that here men, women, and children of every age were interned in entire families. The things found, like, for example, violin parts, children ’s toys, devices for waving the hair [hair curlers] , books and the like, show that many came to this place who did not suspect the destination of their journey. Pieces of burned and de- stroyed passports confirm that citizens from Poland, the USSR, Czechoslo- vakia, and other nations occupied by the Germans were interned here.” On September 24, the Soviet investigatory commission drew up the first official plan of the camp Treblinka. 203 2. Polish Investigations and Forensic Examinations After the conclusion of the previously described investigations, the Treb- linka matter was allowed to rest for more than a year. But the preparations for the Nuremberg Trial awakened the interest of the Jewish Central Historical Commission as well as of the Polish State Prosecutor’s office for that camp. On November 6, 1945, the latter carried out an inspection trip to Treblinka, in which participated: Rachel Auerbach and Józef Kermisz as representatives of the said Jewish Commission, Judge Zdzis ł aw Ł ukaszkiewicz, State Prosecutor J.

A well-paved road runs parallel to the railroad tracks for about 1½ kilometers and then comes to a dead end. Another road branches out from it and comes to an end even sooner. The surface of both roads contains a weird mixture of coal and ashes from the pyres where th e corpses of the inmates were cre- mated. The second road leads in the same direction as the ‘Road to Heaven’ of which no trace is now left. Just a bit of the concrete founda- tions of a horses’ stable – this is all th at is left today of the camp buildings, the barbed wire fences, the barracks, the watchtowers, the gas chambers. Some of the buildings were burned dow n by the uprising, and the rest were carried off by human scavengers from ne ighboring villages after the arri- val of the Red Army. While the Germans were still here, th e whole area had been plowed up and sown with lupine grass. And the lupine grass really grew and covered the whole surface with a green mask. It looked as if all the traces of crime had been wiped away. But since then, during the past year, the human jackals and hyenas have been coming to the burial ground and here is the picture that we saw: Here and there, like patches of grass ne ar the seashore, half-covered by the shifting sands, there were still little clumps of withered lupine. Not one level place in the whole area. Everything had been torn up and dug up, lit- tle hills and holes. And upon them, be neath them and among them, all sorts of objects. Aluminum kettles and pans, enameled tin pots – blackened, dented, full of holes. Combs with teet h broken off, half-rotted soles from ladies’ summer sandals, broken mirrors, le ather briefcases. All this is near the station platform where the camp ’s first barbed wire fences had been. We began our tour at the place where the transports had been unloaded and we continued on the road which the Jews who were brought here had followed. What we saw here was the remnants of the Treblinka ‘Werterfas- sung’. Remnants of the huge piles of Jewish property, which had been packed up and sent away, incinerated, cleared off, and yet still could not be completely cleared away.

As we moved far- ther into the grounds, we walked over a field which was sown with human bones. The bombs had revealed the contents of the desecrated soil. Leg bones, ribs, pieces of the spine, skulls big and small, short and long, round and flat. Skulls!... If only we could get an ethnologist to come here! He could have made the most accura te anthropological measurements relating to the racial features of the Jewish people. [...] We were now standing where the gas chambers had been, the huge mass graves and the pyres. In some pla ces, the smell of death was still mingled with the odor of fire. Indeed, here and there we could see little piles of white ashes along with blackened bones, heaps of soot. All this had been buried several meters deep in the soil, mixed with sand and covered with more sand, but the explosions had brought it to the surface again. In one place the simultaneous explosion of several bombs had created a huge crater. Deep down in the hole, some outlines could be dimly seen through the fog. ‘Those aren’t just bones,’ explained the District Attorney. ‘There are still pieces of half-rotted corpses lying there, bunches of intestines.’ By now, the district attorney and the judge knew every nook and cranny here. They had been conducting their investigations for some time. They had examined both Jewish and non-Jewish witnesses, taken measurements and carried out minor excavations.” For the purpose of performing an official investigation of the scene of the crime, Judge Ł ukaszkiewicz had gone to Treblinka .

Between November 9 and 13, he undertook a thorough ex- amination of the grounds as well as a series of excavations. Afterwards he composed an official protocol, which we reproduce in full in view of its sig- nificance: 207 “Protocol of the tasks performed on the grounds of the death camp Treblinka, which forms the object of the judicial examination.    206 USSR-344.

Maciejewski, performe d the following tasks on the camp grounds: November 9, 1945 Excavations were begun on the grounds using the services of 20 work- ers who had been mustered by the villa ge administration for carrying out roadwork. The excavations began at the location described by the witness Rajzman on November 6, where the so -called ‘camp hospital’ had stood and where, according to the witness, a mass grave is supposed to exist. Since a bomb crater 4 to 5-meter deep is present at the said location – two bombs still lie at a slight distance from this crater – the digging was begun in this crater. In the course of this work numerous Polish, as well as Rus- sian, German, Austrian, and Czech coins as well as broken pieces of vari- ous kinds of containers were discovered. At the end of the work, at ap- proximately 3 pm, at a depth of 6 meters, we encountered a layer which had not been reached previously. There were no human remains found. November 10, 1945 The work was continued, with 36 workers assigned who had been com- mandeered for roadwork. At a depth of 6 meters begins a layer which has never before been uncovered by anyone. It consists partly of all sorts of kitchen utensils and different kinds of household objects; there are also pieces of clothing. At a depth of 7 meters, we reached the floor of the pit – a layer of yellow sand which is not mi xed with gravel. By means of expan- sion of the excavation we succeeded in determining the shape of the pit. It has sloping walls, and the bottom measures about 1.5 meters [sic!] . The pit was presumably excavated with an excava tor. During the course of the ex- cavations, numerous more or less badly damaged Polish documents were discovered, further a badly damaged personal identity card of a German Jew, as well as several more coins: Polish, German, Russian, Belgian, and even American. After we had made certain that this pit, filled with broken pieces of the containers mentioned, ran in a north-south direction on the grounds of the camp area – 2 meters more [in a northerly direction] had been excavated – the workers started work at this location. November 11, 1945 A series of test excavations were performed at the place where the [gas] chambers had to have been located, in order to find their foundation walls if possible.

Numerous human remains were found by these excavations, partially still in a state of decomposition. [208] The soil consists of ashes interspersed with sand, is of a dark gray color and granulous in form. During the excavations, the soil gave off an intense odor of burning and decay. At a depth of 7.5 meters the bottom was reached, which consisted of layers of unm ixed sand. At this point the dig- ging was stopped here. November 13, 1945 With the assistance of 30 workers em ployed for roadwork, the opening of a pit was begun – a site where refuse was deposited in the northeastern section of the camp. In this location, as the workers from the nearby ham- lets explained, a very large number of documents were found up till now. Work was begun at this location where the people [of that area] had dug a three-meter-deep pit in a search for gol d. During the course of the digging, broken pieces of all sorts of kitchen containers as well as a large number of rags were continually found. Asid e from the coins discovered so far, Greek, Slovakian, and French ones were found, as well as documents in Hebrew and Polish and remnants of a Sovie t passport.

In the third paragraph, which bears the title “ Current condi- tion of the camp terrain ”, it says the following: 209 “With the assistance of an expert land surveyor and witnesses, I made an exact inspection of the terrain. Acco rding to the measurements, the area of the camp is approximately 13.45 hectares and had the shape of an ir- regular quadrilateral. No remnants of facilities of the former death camp exist any longer. The only things that remain of the structures are: a ditch with remains of burned wooden poles protruding up, which lead into the cellar, wall bricks from the foundations of the camp’s domestic economics building and the site of the well. Here and there one finds traces of the burned-out wooden poles of the fence and remains of barbed wire. There are also some sections of paved wal ks that remain. Nonetheless, there are still other traces that hint at the existence and functions of the camp. In the northwestern section of the area, the surface is covered for about 2 hec- tares by a mixture of ashes and sand. In this mixture, one finds countless human bones, often still covered with tis sue remains, which are in a condi- tion of decomposition. During the inspection, which I made with the assis- tance of an expert in forensic medici ne, it was determined that the ashes are without any doubt of human origin (remains of cremated human bones). The examination of human skulls could discover no trace of wounding. At a distance of some 100 m, there is now an unpleasant odor of burning and decay. In the southwestern direction, a portion of the camp terrain is covered by aluminum – enamel – glass and porcelain dishes – kitchen utensils – hand luggage – rucksacks – pieces of clothing, etc. There are innumerable holes and craters on the property.” Ł ukaszkiewicz summarized the investigations carried out a month earlier at that location as follows: 210 “During the work on the terrain, I found no mass graves, which, in connection with the statements by the witnesses Romanowski and Wiernik, leads to the conclusion that nearly all of the bodies of the victims were burned, all the more so since the camp was liquidated early and the mur- derers had much time. The ground of the camp was ploughed and sown. Ukrainians were settled there, who fled before the arrival of the Red Army (witnesses Kucharek and Lopuszy ń ski).” On August 9 and 10, 1946, Ł ukaszkiewicz, along with the surveyor Traut- solt and the court physician Wakulicz, searched for mass graves in the area of the camp Treblinka I.

One grave was only par- tially violated, and from it 10 corpses we re able to be recovered. The court physician examined 112 skulls and determined that only in two cases a shot in the head had been the cause of death. The entire surface of the graves amounted to 1,607 m 2 . Concerning the number of the bodies discovered, Ł u- kaszkiewicz wrote: 211 “Due to the destruction of the graves, it is not possible to count the bodies which have been there. The medical expert Mieczys ł aw Piotrowski affirms, however, that one grave of 2 × 1 × 1 m (without taking into con- sideration the upper level of earth which covers the bodies) contains at least 6 nude bodies. Considering the size of all 41 graves, and under the assumption that the levels of corpses reach only up to 1.5 m in depth (the depth of the graves is up to 3 m), one can calculate that at least 6,500 peo- ple were buried there.” On this occasion, the surveyor Trauts olt drew a map of the area of Treb- linka I, on which he indicated the exact position of the graves. [212] Of these, 17 were aligned in a row in a north-south direction; their total length was ap- proximately 510 m. This report provokes the following reflections: 1. It may well be that a grave of 2 m × 1 m × 1 m can hold up to six bodies, but these measurements correspond to an entirely normal single grave. If one wished to dig mass graves, these would not have been merely one me- ter wide. Until evidence to the contrary , it is therefore to be assumed that such a grave contained only one body. 2. These (mass-)graves could have been violated only in the period between October 1944 and August 1946, thus by the Poles, the Soviets, or by both simultaneously – but for what reason? 3. If merely the remains of 122 people were found there, as the Polish judge remarks, where, then, were those of the other ca. 6,400? The likeliest supposition would be that the bodies were dug up by the local authorities and buried at the cemetery of the nearby village, possibly also in the vicinity of the camp, where there is still a cemetery today. In this case, it would of course have been strange that Ł ukaszkiewicz had heard nothing of it. But there is yet another, more disturbing explanation, to which we shall later return: the alleged violation was presumably done in order to be able to exag- gerate the number of victims of Treblinka I. If one takes the three mass graves found by the Soviets in August 1944 as a comparison, then the 41 graves, at    211 Z.

On the other hand, Ł ukaszkiewicz had carelessly written in his report of December 29, 1945, that 213 “in this camp [Treblinka I] approximately 50,000 Poles and Jews were killed.” One further question suggests itself: W ho were the dead in Treblinka I? One knows with certainty that a typhus ep idemic was raging in that camp in the fall of 1943. In fact, a list was ke pt with the names of 148 prisoners who for the most part had succumbed to this illness from November 12 to Decem- ber 20, 1943. 214 The epidemic had broken out some months before, and for this reason a car with 11 tons of calcium hypochlorite was sent to Treblinka I on September 20 from the concentration camp at Lublin (Majdanek), which obviously was supposed to be scattered on the layers of bodies. 215 Since around 10,000 prisoners were interned in Treblinka I during the time of its existence, 216 one can assume that the mass graves uncovered by the So- viets and Poles contained the bodies of all – or nearly all – who died there. That is, further graves or traces of mass cremations were not found. 3. Assessment of the Investigations In her previously cited report, R achel Auerbach spoke pompously of “ physical evidence ” and “ corpora delicti .” But actually neither the Soviets nor the Poles uncovered even the slightest scrap of proof that Treblinka II oper- ated as an extermination camp. The Soviets, in their report of August 24, 1944 – cited in section 1 of this chapter – saw themselves compelled to make the following admission: “At the present it is difficult to uncover the traces and secrets of this oven for the cremation of people, but based upon the available data, one can picture it.” Even the investigations performed by Ł ukaszkiewicz proved to be a com- plete failure in terms of this central question. He arranged excavation at a quite definite spot in the camp where, according to the witness S. Rajzman, a mass grave was located, but discovere d nothing of the kind. He had trenches dug, 10-15 m long and 1.5 m deep, at the places where, according to wit- nesses, the two alleged buildings for gassing had stood, yet merely encoun- tered “ undisturbed layers of earth .” To be sure, he did find skulls, but without wounds from shooting. All the evidence examined by him (coins, documents,    213 USSR-344. GARF, 7445-2-126. 214 Reproduction of the document in S. Wojtczak, op. cit. (note 61), pp. 159-164. 215 J. Gumkowski, A.

Nothing produced even the trace of evidence for a mass murder, to sa y nothing of such a crime committed against several hundred thousand people. Among the objects discovered, the skulls as well as the human body parts found in a state of decomposition deserve particular attention. From whom did they come? If we hold to the official historiography, this question remains un- answered. According to this, the cr emation of the bodies exhumed from the mass graves was finished by August 2, 1943, the day of the prisoner revolt. During this revolt, at least 300 to 400 prisoners are supposed to have been killed within the camp or in the vicinity of the wire fence, 217 and in the follow- ing three weeks, allegedly more than 30,000 Jews from the ghetto of Bia ł ystok were gassed, whose bodies neither the Soviets nor the Poles discovered. If there were such killings, these victims therefore must have been cremated. The same is true for the bodies of tho se killed in the revolt. The surviving prisoners were not, say, killed on the spot , rather they were transferred to So- bibór on December 20, 1943, as can be gathered from a corresponding Wehrmacht bill of lading. 218 If decomposing body parts were found in No- vember 1945, this discovery is also inconsistent with the thesis that the vic- tims involved were murdered more than two years before. Finally, it is strik- ingly problematic that no single complete body was discovered. From whom, therefore, did the sku lls and body parts come? Were they perhaps taken from the mass graves of Treblinka I? Could these have been the remains of victims of the typhus epidemic , which had raged in the camp at the end of 1943? This hypothesis seems all the more plausible as none of the skulls exhibited gunshot wounds. It could also furnish an explanation for the odd circumstance that Treblinka II was bombed: the bombs destroyed not only the two buildings, which in all probabil ity were left intact by the Germans, 219 but also scattered the rotted body parts over a wide area and thus increased the horrible effect of the ‘extermination camp’. In fact, the discovered body parts were thoroughly exploited in propaganda.    217 Y. Arad, op. cit. (note 72), p. 298. 218 Cleared up by Z. Ł ukaszkiewicz, Obóz strace ń w Treblince , op. cit.

Plans of Treblinka On his inspection of the area of the former camp Treblinka II of November 9 to 13, 1945, Ł ukaszkiewicz was accompanied by the sworn surveyor K. Trautsolt. With the help of witnesses, Tr autsolt drew an accurate plan of Treb- linka II as it was at that time. 220 The plan, whose directional axes are trans- posed, 221 shows an irregular quadrilateral whose sides have the following lengths: – North side (actually the east side): 376.5 m – East side (actually the south side): 471.5 m – South side (actually the west side): 490 m – West side (actually the north side): 240 m Thus, the overall area of the Treblinka II camp was approximately 134,500 m 2 (13.45 hectars). On the plan the ruins, which existed in the camp area, are also entered: a burned out cellar (“ piwnica spalona ”), designated by the letter ‘e’, as well as the destroyed house of a settler (“ dom burzony kolonisty ”), marked with the letter ‘l’. On another, typographically identical map, surveyor Trautsolt added the facilities that had allegedly been present on the camp area according to wit- ness testimony. Ł ukaszkiewicz published two versions of this map, of which the first is quite poor, 222 the second of a higher quality. 223 On the latter, the (al- leged) extermination zone, also referr ed to by many witnesses as ‘Camp II’ within Treblinak II, is exactly shown. It is an irregular quadrilateral. If one takes the sides of the camp as a scale, it can be calculated how long the sides of the cremation zone had to have been: – North side (east): 188 m – East side (south): 110 m – South side (west): 174 m – West side (north): 52 m This Camp II is the alleged Death Camp, a subsection of the Treblinka II camp, in which the two gassing installations, the mass graves, and the incin- eration pits are supposed to have been located. According to this, the surface area of this zone would have been some 14,000 m 2 (1.4 hectars), that is, a tenth of the entire camp Treblinka II. The rest of the area of Treblinka II, also    220 See Document 7 in the Appendix. A similar, simplified plan was reproduced by A. Neu- maier, “ The Treblinka Holocaust ”, in: G. Rudolf (ed.), op. cit. (note 81), p. 483; cf. Docu- ment 8. As is obvious from the plan, it orig inates from the archive of the Main Commission for the Investigation of Hitler Crimes in Poland (G ł ównej Komisji Badania Zbrodni Hit- lerowskich w Polsce). 221 The north-south line on the map actuall y corresponds to the east-west line. 222 See Document 9 in the Appendix. 223 See Document 10 in the Appendix."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 92 referred to as Camp I, housed the guards, camp administration, rag sorting and collecting locations, etc. With respect to the shape and the si ze of the entire camp, this plan con- forms quite accurately to the aerial photographs produced over Treblinka II in May and November 1944. On the other hand, the results of the forensic ex- aminations have significantly less correspondence with what can be seen in these aerial photographs. The air photo of May 15, 1944, shows five buildings in the northwest sec- tor of the camp, in a trapezoidal zone of approximately 60 m × 100 m in size. 224 In the south and east, it is bordered by a grove, in the west by the road then leading into the camp as well as by the fence existing at that time. Quite obviously, these buildings have nothing to do with the ‘farmhouse,’ which the SS is supposed to have constructed af ter the liquidation of the camp and in which it is supposed to have left behi nd a Ukrainian for the purpose of watch- ing over the zone. 225 In the air photo of November 1944, one sees only two buildings still there; the three others have apparently been destroyed. 226 The camp Treblinka I was evacuated on July 23, 1944, 227 and the German troops withdrew from the area around Treblinka at the end of July. Thus, when the Soviets took over the camp area in August 1944, they must have found the two buildings still intact, but, as already determined, they wrote in the report of September 15, 1944, that only “ two burned-down farm buildings ” were still standing on the camp area. In November 1945, when Ł ukaszkiewicz came on his tour of inspection, the two buildings no longer existed. Thus they had to have been destroyed by the Soviets or the Poles between September 1944 and November 1945. For what reason? It is highly probable that the other three houses were also destroyed by the Soviets or Poles. The SS in par- ticular would have, in any event, destro yed all five instead of leaving two of them standing. For what purpose would it have done this? In order to leave behind one lonesome Ukrainian in the territory of the enemy? What could his mission even have been? The story is fishy. Yet this is not the end of the curious aspects. Ł ukaszkiewicz found several bomb craters on the camp grounds and even two unexploded bombs. The larg- est crater was 6 m deep and possessed a diameter of approximately 25 m. Therefore the camp must have been bombed, and most surely not through an error. The Germans, who according to official historiography had wiped away all the traces of their crimes by dismantling the barracks, tearing down the    224 See Photograph 10 in the Appendix. 225 A.

From an aerial image of the camp Treb linka II taken in November 1944, it is further revealed that the camp at that ti me – therefore after the area was taken by the Red Army – had not yet been bombed. 219 Thus, the bombardment must have been caused by the Soviets. But the camp Treblinka had already been liquidated in November 1943, and there were no military targets in its direct vicinity. Treblinka I, which was still in operation in May 1944, was not bombed. Why, therefore, did the Soviets drop bombs on Treblinka II? Perhaps in order to obliterate the many traces left be- hind by the SS, traces which could in no way be made compatible with the thesis of mass extermination, and to lay false tracks that seemed to confirm this thesis? 228 As far as the shape and size of the camp is concerned, one may regard the plans of the camp mentioned above as reliable, since firstly they were drawn by a professional surveyor on the basis of measurements done at the site, and secondly, they correspond well to the aerial photographs. One can therefore accept them as a standard for comparison for all plans, which were drawn ear- lier or later by ex-prisoners of the camp or based upon their descriptions. With one exception, which will be discussed la ter, the camp continually shows the shape of an irregular quadrilateral. With respect to the buildings existing in the camp and other facilities, on the other hand, we depend entirely upon the statements of witnesses, since not a single German camp plan has been preserved. The differences between the plans produced by former inmates are less revealing than the graphical devel- opment of the so-called ‘Camp II’, thus of the alleged extermination camp. On that plan, which was enclosed with the report of November 15, 1942, 229 the entire camp is dominated by the two extermination facilities, as if the ‘Camp I’, the administrative sector with quarters, kitchens, storehouses etc., did not exist at all. The two steam execution installations with three or, respec- tively, ten chambers, which were then transformed into engine exhaust gas execution facilities by J. Wiernik on the map published in his writings of 1944, 230 appear in all later plans with th e same shape and in the same loca- tion. 231 Thus, in the beginning, ‘Camp I’ was not depicted at all, and ‘Camp II’ consisted exclusively of the two Death Houses.    228 The body parts found on the camp grounds by th e Poles are rationally explainable only by bomb explosions. 229 See Document 2 in the Appendix. 230 Cf. Chapter II, Section 5. 231 See Document 4 in the Appendix."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 94 The first official plan of Treblinka was produced by the Soviet investiga- tory commission on September 24, 1944. It has the shape of an irregular quad- rilateral, which corresponds to the actual form of the camp only in rough fea- tures. On this plan ‘Camp I’ possesses a clearly outlined structure, which was later adopted by the drawers of many other plans. But ‘Camp II’ is still domi- nated by the two extermination facilities (this time with air evacuation cham- bers), which are called ‘Bath No. 1’ an d ‘Bath No. 2’ and which correspond to the steam execution facilities of the plan of November 15, 1942. The Soviets have added two further, continuall y recurring facilities: the undressing-bar- racks (60 m × 12 m) as well as the path surrounded by barbed wire, which leads to the execution facility and was later baptized ‘hose’. On his plan drawn in 1945, J. Wiernik adopted the Soviet representation of the ‘Camp I’ and enriched ‘Camp II’ by two crematio n grates, two watchtowers, a gallows, several workshops (for cabinetmakers, shoemakers, metal workers), quarters for the guard detachment, prisoners’ ki tchens, prisoners’ barracks, a labora- tory, women’s quarters, a laundry as well as prisoners’ showers. 232 On this plan the mass graves are not yet individually shown. This first occurred at the Düsseldorf Treblinka Trial of 1964f., when State Prosecutor A. Spieß had an official camp plan made that happily displayed four “ corpse pits .” 233 The trail to this ‘official’ plan was obviously severely tortuous. Some plans, which arose in the direct post-wa r period, show quite substantial devia- tions even from the previously describ ed copies. In 1946, Arie (Aleksander) Kudlik drew a plan, in which merely the second of the two extermination fa- cilities is to be seen in ‘Camp II’, but there are five circles designated as “ crematoria ”. 234 The plan produced by the witnesses Laks and P ł atkiewicz deviates even more firmly from the better known. 235 N. Blumental, who pub- lished this drawing in 1946, d escribed its origin as follows: 236 “The copy of the plan ‘Death Camp Treblinka,’ together with the ex- planation relating to it, was sent to the Jewish Central Historical Commis- sion by Moszek Laks, who was called ‘Mie tek’ in Treblinka. He arrived in the camp from Suchedniów (Kielce district) on September 22, 1942. Ac- cording to the statement of the witness, the plan was made by him and by Mr. P ł atkiewicz during his stay in the camp.

The witnesses have produced th e original made in Treblinka, on which basis a corresponding copy was made.” If this is correct, the plan would have to be the most accurate of any drawn by the witnesses, for it is based not upon bare memory, but instead upon direct observation of the camp. It actually is the only one that depicts the form of the buildings and installations, which are nu mbered 1 to 53 and show diverse sub- numerations. The legend of the picture explains these buildings and installa- tions, with short anecdotes from the camp history inserted now and then. The two authors mention installations, which are missing from the other plans, for example the sports field for the Ukrainian guard detachment (17), the recrea- tion space with parasols and chairs for the SS-men (10), an armored vehicle always ready for action (12), the bicycle parking-place (11), the petrol station (15), the projecting roof for protection of the stove-oil containers (16), the vegetable gardens (4), the extinguishin g basin (39), the maneuvering space for trucks (44), the coal supplies (45), a fal se train station, consisting of a barracks with the inscription “ Obermajdanki ,” a clock and a placard with the inscrip- tion “ Wo ł kowysk- Bia ł ystok Train Station ,” ticket room, time table, doors to the waiting rooms of the first, second, and third class with bar, all of it phony (50/1-6), four placards with information about the type of clothing, which the Jews had to deposit there when they had undressed (wool, silk etc.), and last of all some statues: that of a Ukra inian assault group advancing into battle (21), that of a shepherd pasturing his animals (32), that of Jews who are going to work with shovels and picks beneath the sign “ To the Ghetto ” (36). In the legend to the picture, there also appear s an explicit reference to the mass kill- ings – “ Road to the Death Camp ” – but it is the strangest thing that even this ‘Death Camp’, the ‘Camp no. II’, doesn’t appear at all on this plan, as if it were an unimportant detail. Maybe the two artists did not yet know at that point in time how many exterminati on facilities they should show and how. Samuel Willenberg rectified this defici ency more than forty years later by publishing a plan of the camp in his memoirs about Treblinka, 237 in which the camp has the shape drawn by the surve yor Trautsolt, and the buildings are represented corresponding to the technique employed by Laks and P ł at- kiewicz. Of course ‘Camp II’ possesses those installations, which are sup- posed to have existed there acco rding to the official version, i.e. the two al- leged killing facilities, three mass graves, a cremation grate and a barracks for the Jewish prisoners. 238 As we shall see in the last chapter of this book, in all probability ‘Camp II’ contained facilities of quite a different kind.    237 See Document 15 in the Appendix. 238 S.

Number of Victims of Treblinka: Origin of the Official Figure In the preceding chapter we have seen that the report of November 15, 1942, was already speaking of two million murdered in Treblinka at that point in time. In his 1944 writing, J. Wiernik gave no exact number, but spoke merely of “ millions of people .” 239 On April 24, 1944, the Soviet investigatory commission set the number of victims at three million. 240 S. Rajzman, as the chief witness, subdivided the number of victims according to nations of origin. At his interview of September 26, 1944, he stated the following (the linguistic flaws here, as well, are the fault of the Soviet translator): 241 “Daily, 3-4 transports arrived in the camp. There were, of course, days on which 1-2 transports arrived, but that was an exception, not the rule. In each transport 6,000-7,000 people of Jewish nationality arrived. Our ille- gal groups, as I have already said, kept careful record of all contingents that arrived in the camp. Jews from various countries of Europe were brought into the camp. 120,000 arrived from Germany itself, and among them: Austria  40,000  [Further:] Poland  1,500,000  Czechoslovakia 100,000  Russia  1,000,000  Bulgaria and Greece 15,000 Thus, since the records were kept, and indeed from October 1, 1940 to August 2, 1943 [sic!] – there were a total of 2,775,000 men, women, old people and children, of Jewish nationality brought into the camp.” Of course Wassili Grossmann adopted the Soviet three million figure. 242 In December 1945, Ł ukaszkiewicz attempted a first detailed accounting of the claimed Treblinka victims and in doing so introduced those methods, which were supposed to become the standard procedure of the official historiogra- phy: 243 “It is clear that up to now an exact statement of the number of victims is still not possible. One should take care to note that the camp in Treblinka was no longer active from the Fall of 1943 and that the murderers had enough time to obliterate all traces.

Enumerations ba sed upon the capacity of the chambers would not have been accurate, since it is of course unknown how fre- quently they were filled and to what de gree. In determining the number of transports, I have referred to the testim ony of witnesses, in particular train workers, and documents of the Treblinka station. In the time span from August 1942 until the middle of D ecember 1942, the transports were ex- tremely numerous. In this period I am assuming, with very conservative calculations, one transport per day. ( Jewish witnesses declare that most of the time there were 3 transports daily, while Polish railway workers say 2). Afterward, in the period of time from the middle of January until the mid- dle of May 1943, the average number of transports was one per week (wit- nesses: Reisman [sic] and Abe Kohn [sic] say that there were even 3 trans- ports weekly). The number of cars in one transport was determined to be 50. (It emerges from the documents th at many transports consisted of 50 cars.) The number of days in a mont h – 30; the number of weeks in a month – 4. In this way, we arrive at the total number of 7,500 cars from August 1, 1942, to May 15, 1943.” The author then cites some German ra ilway documents, to which we shall return later and from which it can be seen that, from August 17 to August 23, 1943, 266 cars left Bia ł ystok for Treblinka. He continues: “A total of 266 cars. I assume an average of 100 persons in a car. However, most of the witnesses say the number was 200. Thus, without any exaggeration, we must set the number of victims at 781,000. For illustra- tion I add that I am able, on the basis of objective documents: telegrams, railway time-tables, bills of lading etc ., to determine with complete accu- racy the shipment of over 2,000 cars with Jews, although the documents mentioned represent only a small fraction of the railway documents. In my opinion, this proves that the above me ntioned calculation is very conserva- tive.” However, the Polish judge’s claim, according to which 2,000 cars have been documented, does not correspond to reality. In the second of his two writings composed in 1946, he mentions the railway documents in his posses- sion, to wit: – the railway schedule no. 548 of August 3, 1942. – the railway schedule no. 562 of August 25, 1942. – the railway schedule no. 594 of September 21, 1942. – the railway schedule no. 552 of February 1, 1943. – the railway schedule no. 567 of March 26, 1943. – the railway schedule no. 290 of August 7, 1943. Further: – railway placard of August 17, 1943. – telegram of August 18, 1943."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 98 From these documents a total of 809 cars can be counted. Two items are uncertain: the railway schedule no. 548 of August 3, 1942, in which one train per day with 58 cars is announced, and the railway schedule no. 552 of Febru- ary 1, 1943, in which 6 transports w ith 12,000 persons are mentioned, but without a statement as to the number of cars. Under the assumption of a pas- senger density of 100 per car as assumed by Ł ukaszkiewicz, these 6 transports with an average of 2,000 occupants th en had an average of 20 cars per trans- port, so that the total number of cars was not 2,000, but (809+6×20=) 929. In the work mentioned, the author ta kes on his previously cited number of victims, yet undertakes some modifications. For the period of August 1, 1942, until December 15, 1942, he starts with 135 transports, which corresponds to one transport per day for 135 days. For the period from January 15, 1943 (ac- cording to him, no transports arrived between December 16, 1942, and Janu- ary 14, 1943) until May 15, 1943, he assu mes 16 transports (that is, 1 trans- port per week × 4 months × 4 weeks per month = 16 transports), thus a weekly transport during 16 weeks. He adds in the transports that arrived in August 1943, which according to him resulted in the following picture: August 17 and 18: 2 trains with 39 cars each = 78 cars August 18: 1 train with 35 cars August 21-23: 5 trains with 38 cars each = 190 cars. Since he is assuming that each train had an average of 50 cars with 100 oc- cupants per car, the (135+16=) 151 tr ansports equal (151×5,000=) 755,000 deportees. For the 303 cars of August 1943, one arrives at 30,300 deportees, so that a total of (755,000 + 30,300 =) 785,000 people would have been sent to Treblinka; the author rounds this figure to 800,000. 244 In the report of December 1945, he had written that on August 17, 1943, a single train of 41 cars arrived at Trebli nka, yet now he speaks of two trains with 39 cars each, which is surely more correct. In the ninth chapter we will return to this question. The Jewish Central Historical Commission, to be sure, accepted Ł ukasz- kiewicz’s drastic reduction from the Soviet number of three million, but on the other hand held the figure of the Polish judge (800,000) to be too low. In her work, which appeared in 1946 and which h as already been cite d several times, Rachel Auerbach writes: 245 “On the basis of the commission’s findings and of our own calculations, we believe that the figure of over 3,000,000 Jews killed in Treblinka, which has been cited by various authors, is definitely too high. The true figure was probably a little over one million. The mass executions in Treblinka began on July 23, 1942, which that year happened to be the date of Tisha b’Av (the traditional Jewish day of    244 Z.

The largest number of transports were brought in during the months of August, September, October, November, and the first half of December, 1942. At the end of August there was a hia- tus of one week because too many corpses and too much clothing had ac- cumulated and the camp staff was unable to cope with the workload. Sub- tracting that one week, their still rema in four and one half months, with 144 days of full ‘production,’ in the ga s chambers. According to all the tes- timony that has been heard, one to three transports would arrive at Treb- linka each day. Each transport cons isted of an average of 6o boxcars, and each boxcar held between 80 and 150 people. According to a number of witnesses, there were days when the transports had above-average passen- ger loads, and the number of transpor ts arriving was more than three. On such days the gas chambers were in operation until 1 a.m. and finished off more than 20,000 corpses within 24 hours. But on the other hand there were days when the transports were much smaller, particularly those from Germany, Czechoslovakia, and other west European countries, with the deportees arriving in passenger cars which were not so crowded (except that there were many trunks and special baggage cars). Besides, we must take into account the possibility that the witnesses might have counted each 20-car section which was brought onto th e camp siding from the Treblinka station as a separate transport. [...] Thus, we are assuming an average of one transport daily with 60 box- cars each, and 100 people in each car, for the ‘busy season’ of Treblinka ‘production.’ This would be equivalent to an average of 6,000 persons per day. Multiplied by 144 days this would yield a total of 864,000 souls. From the middle of December, 1942 until the middle of January, 1943 – the Gentile holiday season – there was a pause in transports, a vacation of sorts. After this pause, the shipments became much less frequent. Two, or at most three, transports arrived each week. During March and April hardly any transports arrived. The la st transport seen by the Jewish wit- nesses arrived in mid-May, 1943; it c onsisted mainly of people deported from Warsaw after the Warsaw ghetto uprising. [...] We know for certainty that transports of Jews from Bia ł ystok ar- rived during that period. Taking into account all the information available to us, we figure that at least 25 transports of Jews perished in Treblinka between mid- January and September, 1943 (or about the time of the upris- ing) and about 10 transports after th e uprising – or about 35 transports in all. According to our previous estimat e of average number of cars per train and deportees per car, this makes a total number of 210,000 souls. Added to the total for the ‘busy season’ of transports, this would yield a grand to- tal of 1,074,000; in other words, just over one million Jews.”"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 100 The verdict of the Düsseldorf Jury Court of September 3, 1965, devoted a separate paragraph to the question of the number of victims of Treblinka: 246 “In the extermination camp Treblin ka at least 700,000 persons were killed, predominantly Jews but also to a lesser extent Gypsies. These find- ings are based upon the expert report presented by Dr. Helmut Krausnick, the Director of the Institute for C ontemporary History in Munich, to the Jury Court. In his expert report, the expert has utilized all the devices cus- tomary in historical science and accessible to him in the German and for- eign archives, among them the so-called Stroop Report [...] , the protocols of the trial of major war criminals before the International Military Tribu- nal at Nuremberg, and the incomplete official railway documents found af- ter the war (schedules, telegrams, and railway placards) about the trans- ports to Treblinka, which have been th e subject of the main proceedings and which the Jury Court has placed at the disposal of the expert. The expert Dr. Krausnick has said the following, inter alia: According to the Stroop Report, in the period from July 22, 1942, to October 3, 1942, approximately 310,000 and in the period from January to mid-May 1943 approximately 19,000 Jews were brought in freight trains from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka.” However, the Stroop Report actually reads as follows: 247 “The first large resettlement action took place in the period from 22 July to 3 October 1942. In this action 310,322 Jews were removed. In January 1943 a second resettlement action was carried out by which alto- gether 6,500 Jews were affected.” Thus, Treblinka is not even mentioned in this passage of the Stroop Report. In the verdict it says further that from August 21, 1942, to August 23, 1943, transports arrived in Treblinka with Jew s (but also Gypsies) from many other Polish cities as well as Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Yugosla- via, and Greece. The judges go on to cite Krausnick as follows: “An exact number of the persons taken to Treblinka in this manner, however, cannot be determined, since esp ecially with regard to the railway transports only a portion of the railr oad documents is at hand. Neverthe- less, one may estimate the number of persons brought to Treblinka by freight and passenger trains – disregarding the approximately 329,000 Warsaw Jews – at about 271,000, if one assumes an average number of 60 boxcars per train, an average occupancy of 100 persons per boxcar and of 50 persons per passenger car, so that a freight train would have trans- ported about 6,000 and a passenger train about 3,000 Jews to Treblinka.” Since, according to Krausnick, the num bers were often higher (why, then, were they taken as average figures?), and since thousands of Jews and Gypsies    246 A.

Aside from the fact that deportees are still a long way from being ‘people killed’, the number of 329,000 people deported from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka, although plausible in terms of the order of mag- nitude, is not documented at all, while the figure of 271,000 people brought from other places into the camp is a number plucked entirely from thin air. The resorting to the number and occupancy of cars of a deportation train merely serves to conjure up a basis for calculation, which in reality does not exist, because the number of the deporta tion trains is simply and plainly not known. The figures stated by Krausnick were obviously invented, every single one of them, in order to reach the result of (329,000 + 271,000 =) 600,000. Krausnick simply adds 100,000 invented deportees and in doing so does not once make the effort of even stating a fictitious source! At the end of above quoted citation from the Düsseldorf ve rdict, A. Rück- erl furnishes the following reference in a footnote: 249 “In an expert opinion given at the second Treblinka Trial in the Fall of 1969, the expert Dr. Scheffler came to the conclusion, based upon more re- cent research, that in the extermination camp of Treblinka a total of more than 900,000 people were killed, almost exclusively of Jewish descent.” As far as we know, this expert opini on of Wolfgang Scheffler has never been published. In 1976 Scheffler, in collaboration with one Ino Arndt, wrote an article, in which the succinct prose reads: 250 “According to the findings of the Jury Court in the first Düsseldorf Treblinka Trial (1964-1965), which are based upon (incomplete) docu- ments (time-tables, telegrams, railroad car placards) evaluated by the pro- fessional rendering his expert opinion, upon the so-called Stroop Report, upon the literature, and upon witness testimony, in Treblinka at least 700,000 people, predominantly Jews but also Gypsies (approximately 1,000), were killed. The expert in th e second Treblinka Trial (1969/70) ar- rived at a number of 900,000 victims based upon the most recent results of research.” The two authors refer in a footnote to an earlier Rückerl book, 251 in which, however – here as well in a modest footnote! – the same exact thing appears!    248 A.

With respect to the treatment of the number of victims, nothing better oc- curred to Stanis ł aw Wojtczak, the author of the most substantially documented summary of the Treblinka literature (1975), than to take up the hypothesis of judge Ł ukaszkiewicz. He divides the history of the camp into three periods: during the first (July 23 to mid-December 1942) 640,000 people were mur- dered, during the second (January to mid-May 1943) 80,000 and during the third (August 2, 1943, to the closing of the camp) a further 30,000, therefore a total of 750,000. 252 In 1982, Uwe Dietrich Adam divided the camp history into two periods, that from July 23, 1942, to August 28, 1942, with 215,000 victims, and that from September 1942 to October 1943 with 485,000 victims, so that the total number of victims amounts to 700,000. 253 In his book, which appeared in 1987, Yitzhak Arad, as the only one to do so, has issued a detailed list of the transports to Treblinka. 254 Since this is very long, we restrict ourselves here to reproducing the districts of origin and the numbers: district Number Deported Warsaw 365,720 Radom 364,400 Lublin 33,300 Bia ł ystok 117,970 Total 881,390 Divided according to year, Arad‘s data give the following picture: 1942: 824,170 1943: 57,220 An accurate classification of these numbers by month is not possible, since the waves of deportation often began during one month and ended during the one following.

Upon what source does he rely in doing this? He refers to censuses of the Jewish Councils in general, to memoirs and diaries of survivors, some Jewish studies and “ documents of the German railway administration ”, con- cerning which he explains: 255 “If we consider that each fully loaded boxcar transported 100 to 150 people, we are able to determine the approximate number of the Jews taken along in each transport.” By which we would have wound up again, by good fortune, with the method of the judge Ł ukaszkiewicz! Actually, Y. Arad – without admitti ng this – relies upon, more than any- thing else, the Atlas of the Holocaust by British-Jewish historian Martin Gil- bert, first published in London in 1982. This work contains an abundance of numerical data about the deportation of Jews but maintains a total silence re- garding the sources. As far as Poland – a nd, in particular, the deportations to Treblinka – is concerned, the figures of Gilbert are for the most part the prod- uct of fantasy: he has done nothing more than assign numbers snatched out of thin air to the individual locations fro m which real and contrived transports departed; numbers whose total sum came to the figure determined beforehand, of 840,000! 256 Even a fleeting glance at the ta bles shows this incontrovertibly. For example, on table 168 there are approximately sixty locations of the Bia- ł ystok district, from which transports ar e supposed to have departed for Treb- linka on November 2, 1942. To this endless column of mostly unknown small country towns Gilbert allots extrem ely exact numbers of deportations. 257 If there had really been precise figures for these small towns, they would natu- rally have been cited first and foremost by the Polish researchers and histori- ans; but, as we have seen, the latter ha d to confine themselves to hypothetical enumerations of trains and cars.    255 Ibid ., p. 381. 256 M.

In 1965, a little book appeared from the pen of one Manfred Burba, which contained statistics and a bar graph whose columns’ heights indicate the num- ber of Treblinka victims.

Arad, with which he rai sed the number postulated by him (881,390) to 883,000 and added to it 29,000 depo rtees from Slovakia, Theresienstadt, and Greece, which are not mentioned by Arad. The arbitrariness, with which such st atistics are produced, is even more blatantly evident in the calculations of Ryszard Czarkowski, who devotes an entire chapter to them in his Treblinka book published in 1989. He divides the history of the camp into five periods: First Period: June 25 to July 23, 1942 Second Period: July 23 to December 15, 1942 Third Period: December 15, 1942, to January 9, 1943 Fourth Period: January 15 to August 2, 1943 Fifth Period: August 2 to August 23, 1943. For the first period, Czarkowski relies upon the testimony of Jan Su ł kow- ski, according to whom the gas chambers of the first killing facilities were put into operation on June 25, 1942, and from then on one transport of Jews daily arrived at Treblinka. Czarkowski, accepting the figures given by Ł ukasz- kiewicz (50 cars per train, 100 persons pe r car), for a period of 30 days (June 25 to July 23 260 ) gets (30 × 50 × 100 =) 150,000 people deported to Treblinka and murdered there, even before the camp was opened! For the second period, Czarkowski arbitrarily assumes 125 days of opera- tion and 2 transports per day, so that in this time span not fewer than (125 × 2 × 50 × 100 =) 1,250,000 people are to be recorded as having been deported and murdered! The figure for the third period he calculates in the following fashion: ac- cording to an issue of the newspaper Wiadomosc , 120,000 Jews were sent to Treblinka from August 19, 1942, to January 9, 1943. Czarkowski divides this number by the number of days contained in the time span involved, multiplies the result by the number of days between December 15 and January 9 and rounds the product to 22,000, and in doing so shows no concern whatever about the fact that the information appearing in said newspaper boldly contra- dicts his assumption for the second time period: if, from July 23 to December 15, 1942, 1,250,000 Jews were really deported to Treblinka and 22,000 from December 15, 1942, to January 9, 1943, then, from August 19 to December 15, 1942 (120,000–22,000=) 98,000, and from July 23 to August 19, 1942, (1,250,000–98,000=) 1,152,000 Jews had to have been taken to Treblinka, which gives an average of 41,000 per day for the period just named!

For the fifth and final period, he adopts without reservation the 303 cars reckoned by Ł ukaszkiewicz; this corresponds to 30,300 deportees, which Czarkowski rounds to 30,000. Thus he comes up with (150,000 + 1,250,000 + 22,000 + 30,000=) 1,582,000 victims! 261 To be sure, this result is clearly naked insanity, yet the method employed by Czarkowski is exactly the same as that used by the other authors previously cited, with the exception of M. Gilbert and Y. Arad, who proceed more subtly in that – as demonstrated – they parcel out to a certain number of locations, according to utterly arbitrary criteria, a number of victims determined before- hand in order to create the illusion that the total number of those deported to Treblinka, along with their places of origin, are accurately known. Even more remarkably, not one of these authors refers to the report made by the statistician Richard Korherr at th e beginning of 1943 at the instruction of Heinrich Himmler, although very accu rate numbers of the Jews deported to the supposed extermination camps are given in this. In his overview concern- ing the “ Evakuierung der Juden ” (evacuation of the Jews, Part 4 of the fifth chapter of his report), Korherr wrote: 262 “Transportation of Jews from the Eastern provinces to the Russian east: 1,449,692 Processed through the camps in the General Gouvernement area: 1,274,166 through the camps in the Warthegau: 145,302” The camps considered as located “ in the General Gouvernement area ” are Be łż ec, Sobibór, and Treblinka; the camp in the Warthegau was Che ł mno. 263 The number given, 1,274,166, is the very number of victims, according to this historiography, of the three camps in the General Gouvernement up to the end of 1942. If this had been true, 264 the following would have been the result of this: since Be łż ec, to which usually 600,000 victims are ascribed, was closed in December 1942, 265 and since Herr Dr. Scheffler himself postulates for So- bibór 180,000 as the total number of victims for the whole year of 1942, 266 then (1,274,166 - 600,000 - 180,000 =) approximately 494,000 people would    261 R.

How can Herr Dr. Scheffler, who assumes for Be łż ec not the usual 600,000, but 800,000 victims, 267 speak seriously of 900,000 Treblinka vic- tims? According to his numbers, in the year 1942 a total of 1,880,000 people had to have been ‘gassed’ in the thr ee camps of the General Gouvernement area, thus 600,000 more than were ‘p rocessed’ according to the Korherr Re- port! In this section we wish to demonstrat e not so much the differences in the numerical data of the various authors as the incredible superficiality and il- logic of their method. Since they are all speaking not only of deportees, but of people murdered – therefore of people who are supposed to have been killed by means of exactly described techniques – the shocking method of their cal- culations is coupled with an astonishing lack of critical intellect, which often verges on dullness and is strikingly appare nt when compared with the two iso- lated representatives of official histor iography who have brought at least a modicum of critical thinking to this field. In the year 1953, Gerald Reitlinger was already writing: 268 “It would in any case have been impo ssible to gas the greater part of the 310,000 Jews who were deported from Warsaw, together with an un- known proportion from other ghettos, in three gas chambers, each measur- ing fifteen feet square, in no more than seventy-five working days.” Faced with salvaging what could be sal vaged in light of this impossibility, he deduced: 268 “Therefore a large proportion must have died in the trains.” This is likewise an untenable claim: according to the train schedule no. 548 of August 3, 1942, the trip from Warsaw to Treblinka in particular lasted only 3 hours and 55 minutes, 269 and even if the conditions in the overcrowded trains were execrable, under no circumst ances could they have resulted in a mass-dying among the occupants. In an interview granted by Jean-C laude Pressac in 1995, which was pub- lished for the first time in 2000 with changes made according his wishes, Jean-Claude Pressac proposed his own original statistics for the alleged vic- tims of the eastern camps, in which he started fundamentally with their at- tested capacity for extermination: 270 “I have attempted to determine the number of victims of the camps des- ignated as extermination camps on the bas is of material facts: the surface    267 A.

But the number given by him for Majdanek – the only one of these camps from which documentary data were obtained – is still more than double the actual number, for the documents reveal that in Majdanek about 42,300 (Jewish and non-Jewish) prisoners died. 272 One page later Pressac adds: “Concerning the massacre of the Jews, several fundamental notions must be questioned. The given numbers [by official historiography] are to be thoroughly revised. The expression ‘genocide’ is no longer suitable.” Since Pressac does not rely upon documents, but merely upon the theoreti- cal maximum capacity of extermination facilities, whose existence remains unproven, his numbers are of course extremely contestable, but one thing is certain: whoever speaks of a mass extermination in Treblinka – to confine ourselves here to this camp – cannot blindly accept the monstrosities claimed by the witnesses and is not released from the duty of soberly taking into con- sideration that, which Pressac calls “ material facts .” We shall return to this point in the following chapter. Finally, the reader’s attention may be directed to one more grotesque statis- tical detail, which arises out of the cl aim that because of the over-loading of the first ‘gas chamber’ building with on ly three killing-chambers another large building with ten more chambers was constructed. 273 According to the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust , this new building was be- ing constructed into October of 1942. 274 Consequently, we assume that this in-   271 The number of 360,000 Majdanek victims is not postulated by Hilberg, but was accepted in Poland at the beginning of the 1990s as obligat ory; meanwhile, the figure has been reduced by the Polish historians to 230,000. Hilberg speaks of 50,000 Jewish victims of Majdanek (note 17); he does not deal with non-Jewish vict ims. Cf. in this regard J. Graf, C. Mattogno, Concentration Camp Majdanek.

According to the same Ency- clopedia , the chambers in the old building had a total area of about (3 × 4 × 4 m 2 =) 48 m 2 , but the new ones had a total area of 320 m 2 . From November 1942, therefore, (48 m 2 + 320 m 2 =) 368 m 2 were available in the camp for mass killing. The ratio of the areas be fore and after November 1942 was thus 48 m 2 ÷ 320 m 2 = 1:6.67. 275 As already stated, according to Y. Arad, 694,000 people are supposed to have been murdered in Treblinka up to the end of October 1942, but after that ‘only’ 187,390 more. 254 The ratio of the killings in the time intervals up to the end of October 1942 and after that is therefore 1:0.27. If one assumes that the original three small ‘gas chambers’ were used at 100% of their capacity up to the end of October 1942 – otherwise ther e would have been no reason to build the new, larger building – for the thirt een gas chambers which were available from November 1942, there was a utilization factor of only (0.27÷6.67=) 4%! The question that occurs in light of this statistical fact is obvious: For what reason are the ten new, larger ‘gas cham bers’ supposed to have been built, if afterwards they were not needed at al l? The grotesque contradiction between mass killings claimed for the respective time periods and the massive expan- sion of extermination capacity maintained by the witnesses is strong evidence that the latter claim is based not upon facts but rather has an origin in propa- ganda: three ‘gas chambers’ were simply not monstrous enough.

Planning and Construction of the Eastern ‘Extermination Camps’ The planning and construction of th e so-called ‘extermination camps’ Treblinka, Sobibór, and Be łż ec, as reconstructed by the official historiogra- phy, raises serious problems, which ha ve remained unsolved to the present. The chief problem consists in the absence of a rational planning and in the un- believably primitive architectural and t echnical structure of these camps, which stands in the strongest contrast to that of the others, especially of the so- called ‘extermination camp’ Auschwitz. Ra ul Hilberg belongs to the very few representatives of the orthodox historiogr aphy who have brought up the prob- lem and sought to solve it. He explains: 276 “Why three camps and not one? Why were they built one after the other, first Belzec, then Sobibor, and lastly Treblinka? Why in the begin- ning in each camp only three gas cham bers, if they did not then suffice? One could be inclined to answer that the planners did not know the entire extent of their task, that they were gr oping their way toward the goal with- out having it in sight. That is not totally unimaginable, but it is certainly not the whole explanation and perhaps not even the most important. It was a matter of, in short, a difficult administrative problem. The Third Reich had neither a particul ar central authority nor its own budgetary title for a ‘Final Solution to the Jewish Problem.’ The construc- tion of the camps, the positions for guard staff, and the management of transports all had to be financed in a complex manner. Auschwitz II and Lublin, for example, were designated in the beginning as camps for war prisoners of the SS, and indeed not on ly for camouflage but for budgetary reasons. Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka, on the other hand, were plain and simple killing camps. But they could not be operated that way under any    276 Raul Hilberg, “ Die Aktion Reinhard ,” in: Eberhard Jäckel, Jürgen Rohwer (eds.), Der Mord an den Juden im Zweiten Weltkrieg , Deutsche Verlags-Anstal t, Stuttgart 1985, pp. 129f."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 112 economic role, and there is much to show that the means for their con- struction and operation were fragmentary and minimal. That is probably the reason why they did not grow as a fully developed building complex up to the sky. They probably had to be built in sequence and step by step, in order to remain financially inconspicuous.” These theses, proposed by a scholar who devoted his magnum opus 277 for the most part to the conflict with th e bureaucratic-administrative structure of the Third Reich, are quite simply absurd. No one who knows the complex structure and manner of functioning of the National-Socialist economic-administrative offices, 278 can seriously believe that camps of any sort whatever would have been able to arise and develop in the General Gouvernement without having been precisely planned and pre- sented with a specific budget. Regarding construction activities, the General Governor of occupied Po- land was, via several intermediates, ultimately subject to Reichsminister Al- bert Speer, who was the German plenipot entiary for the regulation of all con- structions. Speer instructed his local de puty, the SS-Administrator at the office of the Höherer SS- und Polizeiführer (Senior SS- and Police Chief) in the General Gouvernement, who, in turn, instructed the plenipotentiary for the regulation of all constructions in the General Gouvernement. 279 The SS-Administrators appointed to each Senior SS- and Police Chief (HSSPF) 280 were responsible “ for administration of all economic affairs of the SS departments and SS units in the sphere of their respective HSSPF ”, and in- deed specifically “ for budgetary, treasury, and accountancy, legal affairs [such as leases, insurance affairs, and the like] , preliminary examination, fi- nancial commitments, engine transport, m anagement of raw materials, build- ing, economic undertakings, and concentration camps. ” 281 In practice, the SS-Administrator represented simultaneously Reichsmini- ster Speer and the SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt (WVHA, Economic Administrative Main Office).

The jurisdiction over the General Gou- vernement, upon whose territory the camps of Be łż ec, Sobibór, and Treblinka were situated, was exercised by the Bauinspektion der Waffen-SS und Polizei Reich Generalgouvernement (Construction Inspection of the Waffen-SS and Police Reich General Gouvernement) , which was composed of five Zentral- bauleitungen (Central Construction Offices) with nine Construction Offices of the Waffen-SS and Police. The Construc tion Inspection Office had its seat in Krakow, while the Central Construction Offices were located in Krakow, Warsaw, Lublin, D ę bica, and Lemberg (the later belonged administratively to the General Gouvernement 282 ). The Central Construction Office of the Waf- fen-SS and Police at Warsaw was thus subject to both the Construction In- spection Office of the Waffen-SS and Police Reich General Gouvernement and also to the SS-Administrator at the Senior SS- and Police Chief in the General Gouvernement. All construction work carried out in the General Gouvernement in the year 1942 followed normal bureaucratic practice, which appeared to be as follows: instructions from the Department Group C “ Constructions ” of the SS-WVHA, in correspondence with the directives of Reichsminister Speer, went over the SS-Administrator to the Central Construction Offices and Construction Units, which were in charge with accomplishing the actual constructions.

Director of the Central Construction Office. (Signature illegible) SS-Scharführer.” This document proves that the Central Construction Office of the Waffen- SS and Police at Warsaw w as responsible for the construction of the Treblinka camp and thus was following common practice. According to Y. Arad, two German firms had contracts for the establishment of the camp: Schönbronn in Leipzig and Schmidt-Münstermann. 286 These firms – besides them, still others doubtlessly participated in the construction – received their commissions from the Central Construction Office of the Waffen-SS and Police at Warsaw, just as did Lucjan Pucha ł a. Thus, this office functioned as employer, and all the norms pertained that applied in the in tercourse between the Central Construc- tion Office and the civilian firms acting on its commission, including those of financial aspect. Surely the accounting department of the construction inspec- tion unit of the Waffen-SS and Police Re ich General Gouvernement regulated the latter, just as the accounting office of the construction inspection unit of the Waffen-SS and Police of Reich - ’Ost’ (east) was responsible for Ausch- witz. 287 This means that for Treblinka (and, logically, correspondingly also for Be łż ec and Sobibór) a specific budgetary title must have existed and that the camp came into being on the foundation of a precise plan. This applies also to the labor camp Tr eblinka I.

In short: the claim according to which the camps Treblinka, Be łż ec, and Sobibór are supposed to have been constructed without any sort of budgetary title is historically false and plainly absurd to anyone familiar with the bureau- cratic conventions of the Third Reich. Now how can the expressly primitive character of these camps be ex- plained? In reality, this question is fa lsely formulated, for the primitiveness of the three camps does not emerge from any kind of documentation, but merely from witness statements. We have gra phically seen in the preceding chapters what sort of value ought to be attach ed to these. Thus, the primitive character of the camps is no objectively proven fact, but simply a subjective reconstruc- tion. On the contrary: since the camps we re constructed in conformity to the usual economic and administrative conven tions, as they were applied to the other camps, they could not be primitiv e at all, and one comes inevitably to the conclusion that the subjective reconstructions based upon testimonies of witnesses cannot reflect the reality. With these unreal reconstructions, th e unspeakably primitive character of the crucially important buildings, for whose sake the camps are supposed to have allegedly been built – namely th e killing and corpse cremation facilities – is glaringly obvious. We begin with the killing installations, and we will confine ourselves strictly to Treblinka. 2. The Alleged Killing Installations in Treblinka In the following, we will dispense with any discussion of the many techni- cal fantasies, like the steam and vacuum chambers, as described by many wit- nesses. We confine ourselves to those extermination techniques which, ac- cording to today’s official historiography, are supposed to have been em- ployed in Treblinka. As starting point for this, we choose the verdict of the Jury Court of Düsseldorf 295 of September 3, 1965, against Kurt Franz : 296 “The gas chambers, in which the Jews were killed by means of exhaust fumes of a diesel engine, formed the center of the death camp. At the be- ginning of the mass killings there was only the so-called ‘old gas house.’ The building, solidly constructed out of brick upon a concrete foundation, contained 3 gas chambers, which were approximately 4 × 4 m in area and    295 See Chapter V concerning this. 296 A.

All of the rooms were situated on a wooden cor- ridor which was built off from the masonry structure and which one reached over several steps. From this corridor, doors led into the gas chambers. These doors were about 1.80 m in height and 90 cm wide and were made somewhat in the way that air-raid doors are, so that they sealed the chambers off nearly airtight. Oppo site of these, on the exterior wall in each gas chamber, were flap doors ma de from thick wooden planks. These were approximately 2.50 m wide and about 1.80 meters high and could be tilted upwards when opened in the m anner of modern garage doors. They led to a wide concrete ramp, situated about 0.70 m above the level of the ground, which ran around the entire building. The floor of the gas cham- bers was tiled and was tilted toward the ramp. The walls were likewise tiled, at least to a certain height. On the ceiling of the individual chambers there were several pipes and showerheads . Due to this, the gas chambers were supposed to evoke the impression of shower rooms. However, the pip- ing really served for the introduction of exhaust gases produced by the die- sel engine in the machine room. Th ere was no special lighting installation in the chambers. Very soon after the inception of operations, the capacity of the old gas house proved to be insufficient for smoothly liquidating the daily arriving transports of Jews. For that reason, at the end of August/beginning of Sep- tember 1942, the construction of a new large gas house was started, which contained more and larger gas chambers and was able to be put in opera- tion after a construction period of about one month. This building, which was built betw een the junction of the hose and the old gas house, was also solidly built out of brick on a concrete foundation. Five wide stone steps, decorated with flower bowls at the sides, led to the entrance at the front of the building and opened into a wide corridor, on both of whose sides lay the new gas chambers. Their exact measurements cannot be determined, since neither the defendant L. nor his co-defendants nor even the Jewish witnesses can give precise details about this. All are merely in agreement that the new gas chambers had a holding capacity approximately double that of the chambers in the old building. The new gas chambers were probably about 8 m long, 4 m wide, and 2 m high. [...] The process of extermination itself lasted approximately 30 to 40 min- utes. [...] An accepted holding capacity of approximately 200 to 350 people per gas chamber in the old house and approximately 400 to 700 people per gas chamber in the new house might safely be said to be most probable accord- ing to all [information] .”"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 118 This description basically corresponds to that given by Ł ukaszkiewicz, based upon the witness testimonies of Wiernik, Reichmann, Czechowicz, and Finkelsztejn: 297 “Both structures were built according to the corridor system, in which the entrance to the chambers in the 1st building was on both sides of the corridor, while in the small building th e entry to the chambers was only on one side. The entrance was relatively small and closed with exactly fitting doors. On the exterior wall of the c hamber was a large flap, which opened upward and which served for removal of bodies. The chambers were tiled; the floor sloped toward the exterior, which facilitated the removal of bod- ies. In the ceiling there were openings of the exhaust pipes of the engines that were located in annexes. These openings served to supply the exhaust gas, from which the victims suffoca ted. Witness Wiernik, who was em- ployed as a master carpenter during all of his stay at the camp and had relative freedom of movement, gives the following dimensions of the cham- ber: in the small building 5 × 5 m, in the large 7 × 7 m.” The data given by the official histori ography is, in reality, based almost en- tirely upon the witness testimony of Jankiel Wiernik, who for his part, as we explained in the second chapter, fell back upon the description of the steam chambers in the report of November 15, 1942. But even with respect to the structur e, indeed, even with respect to the number of the alleged gas chambers of the second installation – likewise based upon witness statements – variations exist, which are not given a whis- per of mention in the official historiography. In Chapter III we cited the witness testimony of Abe Kon, according to whom the second killing facility containe d 12 gas chambers. The Soviet report concerning Treblinka of August 24, 1944, in which 12 gas chambers are cor- respondingly mentioned, is based upon this testimony. 298 As already seen, the current official version speaks of 10 chambers. The witnesses Willi Metz and Otto Horn, who had worked in ‘Camp II’, declared that the installation had 6 gas chambers. 299 Jankiel Wiernik wrote that at his arrival in Treblinka there had been three gas chambers and that tw o more were added during his stay in the camp even before the constructi on of the second extermination facility, 300 so that there had been 15 and not 13 gas chambers in total. According to the witnesses cited by W. Grossmann, the gas chambers in the second facility measured 7 m × 8 m, 301 according to the witnesses ques-   297 USSR-344.

The ma- ximum capacity of these chambers varies between 600 (Abe Kon) and 1,000 to 1,200 (Jankiel Wiernik). 304 Lastly, Elias Rosenberg claims that the second killing facility was not constructed be tween August and October 1942, but rather in March of 1943. 305 The witnesses are also not in agreement about the location of the small ob- servation windows in the gas chambers. In the front-line report of TASS of September 11, 1944, it says: 306 “The people in the ‘bath’ died under horrible tortures after ten minutes. The ‘bath-master’ recorded this by means of a small glass window in the door.” On the other had, the Polish-Soviet protocol of September 15, 1944, as- serted: 307 “On the roof of this – hermetically sealable – building was a small window, through which the death struggle of the dying could be observed.” E. Rosenberg also claims that this little window was located on the roof of the gas chambers. 308 At the same time, the military examin ing judge of the military administra- tion of the 65th Soviet Army, the Firs t Lieutenant of Justice Jurowski, was drawing plans of the first as well as the second alleged killing facilities of Treblinka. The first bears the inscription “ Plan of the Building no. 1 of the Treblinka Camp 2, in which the killing of people of Jewish nationality oc- curred.” 309 The drawing is furnished with num bers from one to seven and fur- ther with the Cyrillic letters ‘a’, ‘ б ’, ‘ в ’.

These two drawings without a doubt depict two facilities with gas cham- bers, which are fed by engine exhaust gases (or, to put it more accurately, by the exhaust gases from a tractor). But none of the witnesses questioned by Judge Jurowski mentioned such a versi on of killing. As we pointed out in Chapter II, to be sure they spoke of an engine, but this served merely to oper- ate the pump, by which the air was said to have been sucked out of the cham- bers and not for filling the chambers with exhaust fumes. Th is vacuum version was then officially stated in the Sovi et report concerning Treblinka of August 24, 1944, as well as in the Polish-Soviet protocol of September 15, 1944. What, therefore, was Judge Jurowski’s source? The answer is simple: Jankiel Wiernik‘s expositions of May 1944, because the Soviet investigating judges were in possession of a copy of his text, which is explicitly mentioned in the Soviet re port of August 24, 1944. As will be re- called, Wiernik had simply transformed the steam chambers of the report of November 15, 1942, into engine exhaus t gas chambers and even copied the drawing of the camp enclosed with that report. On this plan 311 the two alleged killing installations are drawn in, the first with three and the second with ten chambers, whose structure is practically identical with those of the two draw-   310 See Document 19 in the Appendix. 311 See Document 4 in the Appendix."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Chapter IV: The Alleged Extermi nation Facilities in Treblinka 121 ings of Judge Jurowski. But because Wi ernik had forgotten to append to the ten gas chambers of his second drawing an eleventh room, in which the engine was installed, Judge Jurowski saw himsel f forced to draw in the tractor (en- gine) at the end of the corridor, between chambers 5 and 10. He painstakingly adopted Wiernik‘s drawings, yet nonetheless attempted to bring a minimum of order to them and in doing so drew e quipment within the installations, which Wiernik had not mentioned. Since the Soviet judge understood significantly more about engineering than that witne ss, he enhanced the drawing with an- other element, which would have been indispensable for a hypothetical mass killing with engine exhaust fumes, but of whose necessity Wiernik had not been aware: the openings for the removal of the gas, i.e. of the air-gas mix- ture. We will come back to this important point in Section 8. It is clear from all this that Judge Jurowski was technically too well-versed to swallow the nonsense told by the witn esses, but as Soviet military judge he accepted the story of the mass extermination in engine exhaust gas chambers and imbued it with a certain degree of plausibility by virtue of his drawings. 312 3. Diesel engine or Gasoline Engine? In his excellent study The Diesel Gas Chambers: Idea for Torture – Ab- surd for Murder , 99 Friedrich P. Berg investigated the present version of the mass murder in the alleged eastern extermination camps – gassing by means of diesel engine exhaust gases – from a technical standpoint. He particularly emphasizes that according to the laws of toxicology, a person who is exposed to a concentration of 0.4% carbon monoxide (CO) ( i.e. 4,000 parts CO per million parts of air), dies in less than one hour. Since the time, in which death occurs, is directly proportional to th e percentage of CO, it requires corre- spondingly a concentration twice as high, thus 0.8%, in order to bring about death within less than a half-hour. Of the two main types of diesel engines, which existed in the forties, Berg examines the one whose exhaust gases con- tain a larger percentage of CO, that is, the engine with an undivided combus- tion chamber. In running at idle, this engine produces about 0.03% CO, but under full load approximately 0.4%. Berg says in this regard: 313 “In other words, here we have a Dies el which looks as if it could have been used to commit mass murder in half an hour.” But a diesel engine cannot continually run at full load, since it would soon break down due to the accumulation of solids compounds on the cylinder walls. On the other hand, a diesel normally operates with a large air surplus.    312 At this point in time, all references were to an “ engine ;” the version of a diesel engine had not yet triumphed. 313 Friedrich P. Berg, op. cit. (note 99), p. 447."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 122 At idle, with an air-fuel ratio of 100:1, the engine emits 18% oxygen, which is insignificantly less than the oxygen co ntent of the air (21%) and suffices for survival. During a homicidal gassing, the ox ygen content of the air must be so low that the victims suffocate from lack of oxygen, i.e. , at a level of approxi- mately 9%. This is attained by produci ng an air-fuel ratio of 25:1, which is reached at about ¾ of full load. According to the witnesses, the diesel engine of a Russian armored tank was employed at the gas chambers of Be łż ec, Sobibór, and Treblinka. The strongest Soviet tank engine was found in the tank type T34: a V12-cylinder diesel with undivided combustion chamber, a maximum performance of 550 HP, a total cylinder volume of 38,860 cm 3 = 38.86 liters, and a maximum of 1,900 revolutions per minute. If the second gassing installation of Treblinka measured a total of 640 m 3 and was able to accommodate 3,200 peop le, Berg concludes from his calcula- tions that the effective volume of air contained in it amounted to 400 m 3 , if as- suming a body volume of 75 liters per person. If one rounds the maximum number of revolutions per minute to 2,000, since a four-stroke engine empties its piston chamber only every second revo- lution, it emitted (1,000 × 38.86 =) 38,860 liters or 38.86 m 3 of exhaust gases in one minute. Thus, the engine would have exchanged the entire content of air of the gas chambers in (400 ÷ 38.86 =) in something under 10 minutes. The gas chambers had to have openings for the removal of the air-gas mixture; otherwise they would have collapsed fro m the increased pressure. Berg begins by assuming that it requires 20 minutes under these circumstances until roughly the same percentage of CO is r eached in the gas chambers as in the exhaust gases themselves, i.e. , realistically, 0.22 vol.% at full load and an air- fuel ratio of 20:1. As Berg stresses, experiments with guinea-pigs showed the following: 314 “In the animal experiment previously described with a real CO concen- tration of 0.22%/vol., which was already established before the test animals were even introduced and which, because of the reduced oxygen content of 11.4%/vol., corresponded to an effectiv e CO concentration of (0.22×21÷ 11.4=) 0.4%/vol., it still took more than three hours to kill all of the test animals. It is, therefore, perfectly reasonable and even quite conservative to say that in a similar gassing attempt with humans and with only a gradually increasing CO concentration, the majo rity of people in the alleged gas chamber would still be alive after on e or even two hours. Such a result would have been an utter fiasco.” Had the SS-men wished to carry out mass gassings with engine exhaust gases, Berg argues, they would surely have resorted to a gasoline engine, whose exhaust gases normally contain 7% by volume of carbon monoxide and    314 Ibid ., p. 458."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Chapter IV: The Alleged Extermi nation Facilities in Treblinka 123 1% by volume of oxygen. With corresponding adjustment of the carburetor, the carbon monoxide content can be increased up to 12%. But that would not even have been the ‘best’ source of CO available during World War II: Due to a lack of gasoline, the German governme nt passed laws that made it compul- sory to equip all diesel-driven vehicles with producer gas generators, which generate a gas with up to 35% of CO from wood or coke. Hundreds of thou- sands of these truly poisonous generators operated in wartime Germany and in the occupied territories, and this technology was well-known to all major German politicians at that time, as Berg shows. It is thus more than justified when Berg concludes: 315 “How absurd to believe anyone with even a minimum of technical under- standing would even try to use the exhaust from [diesel engines] for murder, when the [producer gas] fuel itself was a thousand times more lethal!” The next question is, whether the Germans in 1941 would have had the knowledge that a gasoline engine would ha ve been far more efficient for the mass killing of human beings in gas chambers. The answer is unequivocally yes. We present a single example. In 1930, the Reich Office of Health and the I.G. Farbenindustrie company joined forces to perform a series of toxicological and hygienic experiments with combustion products of engines. E. Keeser, Professor and Doctor of Medicine, V. Froboese, Ph.D., and R. Turnau, Ph.D., from the Reich Office of Health, participated in the research project, and as representatives from the I.G. Farbenenindustrie of Oppau and Ludwigshafen E. Gross, Professor and M.D., E. Kuss, Ph.D., G. Ritter, Ph.D., and Professor W. Wilke, with a doc- torate in engineering. The result of the study was published as a monograph under the title Toxikologie und Hygiene des Kraftfahrwesens . 316 The experiments were performed excl usively with gasoline engines be- cause their exhaust gases were regarded as far more harmful than those of die- sel engines. First, the scientists conduc ted preliminary experiments with three different engine types: Hanomag 2/ 10 HP, Adler 6/25 HP, and Benz 10/30 HP. The average composition of the exhaust gases was as follows: 317 Conditions Engine Carbon Dioxide [% CO 2 ] Carbon Monoxide [% CO] Oxygen [% O 2 ] Hydrogen [% H 2 ] Methane [% CH 4 ] Idle Hanomag 7.7 5.2 1.6 -  - [1,000 RPM] Adler 8.5 8.5 1.1 3.7 1.0  Benz  9.2  6.3  1.0  3.4  0.1  Full Load Hanomag 3.2 0.2 1.4 - - [1,500 RPM] Adler 13.3 0.2 2.3 0.1 0.1  Benz  13.5  1.7  1.1  0.5  0.1     315 Ibid ., p. 464. 316 Toxikologie und Hygiene des Kraftfahrwesens , Julius Springer Verlag, Berlin 1930. 317 Ibid ., p. 4."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 124 In subsequent experiments, the researchers chose the Adler engine. Re- garding the working conditions of this engine they remarked: 318 “A special throttle device was attached to the air supply line of the car- buretor, which permitted modifying the amount of fresh air sucked in by the machine within certain limits. By means of reducing the air supply, a rise in the content of unburned substa nce and thus of the CO content in the exhaust gas could be achieved, while just the opposite, a reduction of CO content, resulted from an increased air supply.” After an analysis of six different kinds of gasoline, the scientists performed twelve main experiments. With respect to the emission of CO, the highest val- ues were recorded at idle: 319 A NALYSIS OF GAS IN DIFFERE NT EXPERIMENTAL SERIES 320 CO 2 % O 2 % CO % H 2 % CH 4 % N 2 % 8.20 1.12 9.08 4.70 0.60 76.28 8.20 2.07 8.30 5.37 0.23 75.63 9.10 0.73 8.55 2.61 2.10 76.98 9.10 0.89 7.64 3.32 0.53 78.15 8.90 1.35 8.06 3.99 0.17 77.54 8.90 1.24 8.10 4.33 0.22 77.16 7.50 1.35 10.01 4.42 1.36 75.36 7.50 1.99 8.08 4.48 0.18 77.40 8.80 1.05 8.00 3.85 0.82 77.49 8.80 1.03 8.17 3.64 0.28 77.78 9.90 2.70 7.40 2.50 0.26 77.30 9.90 3.47 7.95 2.14 0.11 76.27 The technique employed in conducting the experiments was very progres- sive for that time. 321 The researchers were carrying out toxicological tests, in which they constructed sophisticated miniature gas chambers. In particular, they performed preliminary tests, about which they wrote: 322 “The tests show that neither guinea pigs nor white mice showed severe symptoms of poisoning during a test duration of two hours with a CO con- centration of 0.3%, but that any increase of the CO content beyond 0.3% led to seizure attacks, ataxia or na rcosis, and that already from these symptoms the increase of CO concentr ation in the air could be deter- mined.” The actual experiments were conducted with five types of gasoline and lasted 120 minutes each. White mice and guinea pigs served as experimental animals.

In these experiments, which lasted 120 minutes, ataxia and narcosis appeared in the guinea pigs, but not yet death. 324 This study, whose findings we condensed down massively, has an impres- sive bibliography of no less than 240 expert papers. 325 It is now easy to con- clude that the story of the diesel engine exhaust gas chambers is not only in- credible, but borders on the absurd: whoe ver seriously defends it is like some- one who wishes to claim that during the Second World War the Reich gov- ernment preferred fighting with weapons of the stone age, although it had at its disposal a broadly diversified arsenal of the most modern weapons of that time! This comparison is by no means a lame one, since according to the official historiography the planning and constr uction of the alleged extermination camps in eastern Poland was a matter of state, and the extermination of the Jews in these camps is supposed to have been one of the chief goals of the Third Reich. 4. The ‘Struggle’ between Engine Exhaust Gases and Hydrogen Cyanide Gas Among the many absurdities of the so-c alled ‘Gerstein Report’, a very im- portant one concerns his alleged mission, which Y. Arad summarizes as fol- lows: 326 “The gassing system that had been developed and introduced by Wirth in the Operation Reinhard death camp s proved only partially satisfactory. The frequent engine breakdowns cau sed disturbances and delays in the en- tire extermination process. Globocnik was aware of these shortcomings and, in coordination with the higher authorities of the SS, decided to look into the possibility of introducing an alternative gassing system. The pre- vailing opinion among the higher SS authorities in charge of the extermi- nation of the Jews was that Zyklon B was more suitable for this task.

[328] Gerstein‘s main mission was to check th e possibility of introducing the gas Zyklon B [329] in the gas chambers. Zyklon B had already been successfully used in Auschwitz, instead of the e ngines that were still supplying the mon- oxide gas in the death camps of Operation Reinhard.” Later, Arad explains that Gerstein had “ submitted a written report of his mission when he was incarcerated in an American [330] army prison at the end of the war in April-July 1945 ”, 326 cites an excerpt from this ‘report’, and con- cludes: 331 “Gerstein‘s mission did not bring about any changes in the gassing sys- tem in the Operation Reinhard death camps. Carbon monoxide, supplied by truck or tank engine, as introduc ed by Wirth, remained the means of killing used in these camps. The fact that Gerstein witnessed in Belzec a breakdown of the diesel engine that supplied the gas and during which people were locked inside the gas c hamber for almost three hours until the engine started working did not cause any change in the procedure. Wirth refused to give up the gassing system he had developed. His professional pride did not permit him to admit that the use of Zyklon B for mass killings, as developed by Rudolf Höss, the commander of Auschwitz, was preferable to carbon monoxide. He asked and subs equently persuaded Gerstein not to propose to Berlin any other gas c hamber type for Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. Gerstein did not even carry out any killing experiments with the Zyklon B he had brought with him from Kolin. [332] The gas was buried on the pretext that it had been spoiled in transit.” 5. The ‘Mission’ of Kurt Gerstein This tale related by Arad is totally absurd. First of all, let us summarize Gerstein’s mission in the way he described it:    327 According to Gerstein: SS Main Operations O ffice, Office Group D, Sanitation Office of the SS, Hygiene Department. PS-2170, p. 2. 328 In reality, Pfannenstiel had nothing to do with Gerstein‘s mission and accompanied him “ by accident ” (see section which follows). 329 Zyklon B was not gaseous, but rather liquid hydrogen cyanide absorbed on a porous carrier- substance. The gross error committed by Arad here frequently surfaces in the official histo- riography. 330 In reality, this was a French military prison, that of Cherche-Midi: Document T-1306, report of the prison physician Dr. Trouillet of July 25, 1945. 331 Arad, op. cit.

In this capacity, Gerstein received a visit on June 8, 1942, from SS- Sturmbannführer Günther of De- partment IV b 4 of the SS- Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA, SS Main Office of Imperial Security), 339 who entrusted him with the task, a mission for the German Empire under utmost secrecy, of taking charge of 100 kg, 340 – no, 260 kg 341 – of a substance which at the same time was prussic acid (HCN) 342 and potassium cyanide (KCN), 343 and of bringing this by car 344 – no, by a truck 345 – to a location that only the driver knew. Günther‘s task offered Gerstein the opportunity of inspecting the alleged eastern extermination camps.

But that’s not enough: even more oddly, the RSHA had revealed the alleged secret to a simp le driver and furthermore to an out- sider (Pfannenstiel), but not to the pe rson directly concerned, namely Ger- stein! The goal of Gerstein‘s mission was to convert the operational method of the gas chambers from diesel exhaust gases to prussic acid, 358 but in blatant contradiction to this Gerstein explained: 359 “I understood my mission. [...] It was required of me to discover a more rapid and more effective means of killing than this extermination of primitive sort. I proposed the employ ment of more toxic gases, especially of those which give off prussic acid.” Consequently, he must have discove red that killing-method, which had previously been indicated to him by the RSHA, and was proposing precisely that substance, which the RSHA had already selected itself!

If one keeps in mind that – according to the verdict of the 1965 Munich Jury Court – the six alleged gas chambers of Be ł - ż ec are supposed to have had an effective volume of 145 m 3 , if one subtracts the space taken up by the approximately 1,500 victims, 362 then 500 g of prus- sic acid would have been sufficient in order to theoretically reach over ten times the instantly lethal concentration in every gas chamber. Under these cir- cumstances, the 100 kg of prussic acid, which Gerstein says he brought with him, would have sufficed to kill 300, 000 people in 200 gassing events! This quantity was obviously too large for a few simple experiments. For these, about a dozen canisters of Zyklon B w ould have been enough and, if he al- ready had to go to Lublin, Gerstein woul d have easily been able to pick these up in the Majdanek camp, where the T esch & Stabenow firm had just deliv- ered 360 Zyklon B canisters of 1.5 kg each, thus 540 kg total, two weeks be- fore, on July 30, 1942. 363 In Lublin, Gerstein was received by SS- Brigadeführer Odilo Globocnik, who disclosed the existence of the extermination camps of Be łż ec, Sobibór, and Treblinka to him: 364 “This secret Reich matter is currently one of the most secret, one might say the most secret that there is.” Thereupon Globocnik explained to him what his main mission was: 365 “Your other – even far more important – mission is the conversion of our gas chambers, which are now working with diesel exhaust, to a better and quicker way.

This story also seemed fis hy to the French Examining Magistrate Mattei, who interrogated Ge rstein on July 19, 1945: 366 “Question: ‘To whom did you give an account of the execution of your mission?’ Answer: ‘After my return to Berlin from a journey, which had lasted about two weeks, I gave no one a report about the execution of my mission. No one asked me anything.’” The absurd answer did not satisfy Mattei, and he probed further: 367 “Therefore, according to your own admission, you received an impor- tant mission in Berlin in your capac ity as technician, a mission which was so important that you had to carry it out as a state secret, you visited three camps and were given an audience by a General, who, in view of the pur- pose of your mission, considered it necessary to communicate to you the remark of the two great Nazi leaders. [368] How can you persist in wanting to convince us that you: 1) Did not fulfill the goal of your mission at all; 2) Gave a report to no one; 3) No one put any sort of questions to you concerning this?” Gerstein answered: “Hauptmann [Captain] Wirth had such a personal position with Himmler that he could say to me that I didn’t have to trouble myself about this matter any more, and I obeyed him in this.” This defensive strategy was demolished by Gerstein himself when he stated: 369 “Wirth asked me to propose no sort of change in the gas chambers and killing methods used up to now, since it all had worked out and proved to be best. Remarkably, I was never asked about that sort of thing in Berlin.” Thus, Christian Wirth did not have such great influence with Himmler after all! This is also ‘confirmed’ by the allegation that Wirth was afraid of Ger- stein: 370 “Hauptmann Wirth comes in. One sees that he is afraid because I see the disaster.” Gerstein‘s tale is based upon three premises: 1.

It had therefore been planned at the governmental level of Himmler, through Department IV B4 of the RSHA (Eichmann). 3. The execution of the extermination plan had been entrusted to Globoc- nik, who was directly responsible to Himmler for it. The RSHA allegedly gave Gerstein th e task to change the way the gas chambers functioned. Therefore, the order had to have been issued by Himmler. Himmler had supposedly done th is because the system employed at that time – diesel engine exhaust gases – was unsatisfactory. Globocnik had been in full agreement with it, and only he would have been able to inform Himmler about the inefficiency of this method of extermination. According to Michael Tregenza, Globo cnik ordered the restructuring of Treblinka after an inspection perform ed on August 19, 1942, and entrusted this task to Christian Wirth as “ Inspector of the SS-Sonderkommando ‘Opera- tion Reinhard .’” 371 We therefore return to our question at the outset: Why would such an inefficient murder technique have been chosen at the governmental level for the execution of a plan, which concerned such a secret matter of the Reich ? Gerstein belonged to the SS Main Operations Office, Office Group D, Sanitation, of the Waffen-SS, Hygien e Department. Why did the RSHA turn to this office in order to change the killing-system then in operation, yet did not inquire about a more effective one? If the use of engine exhaust gases had been planned, why did the RSHA not contact the Reichsgesundheitsamt (Reich Office of Health) in Berlin at that time and the research laboratories of I.G. Farbenindustrie company, which, as we have seen, had substantial experi- ence in this field at its disposal? If the RSHA had decided to use prussi c acid in the gas chambers, why did it commission Gerstein to pick up liquid prussic acid instead of Zyklon B? And finally, if the diesel exhaust gas chambers proved to be so inefficient, why had their operational method not been changed? Thus, although the killing method allegedly used in Be łż ec had been proven to be inefficient and the RSHA – i.e. Himmler – is supposed to have decided to modify it at the beginning of June 1942, the construction of the second gassing installation in Treblinka at the end of August/beginning of September 1942 is supposed to have be gun using exactly the same inefficient diesel principle! And who – apart from Himmler – could have issued the order for the construction of this second installation? Thus, the ‘Gerstein Report’, which Y. Arad describes as “ one of the first and most important documents relating to Operation Reinhard ”(sic), 372 is not only devoid of any sort of evidentiary weight, but on the contrary, it also    371 M.

Russian Engines or German Engines? But we have not reached the end of absurdities yet. How can one believe, in all seriousness, that for the executio n of such an important government pro- gram as that of a ‘secret Reich matter’ old Russian diesel engines would have been used? 373 Where did the SS intend to procure spare parts for repairs when the inevitable wear and tear occurred? But there is a yet more basic problem. In Chapter II we spoke of the elec- tric power supply of Treblinka, which c onsisted of an engine and an electric generator driven by it. We have fu rther seen how, according to the witness Wiernik, the alleged gas chambers were operated by the exhaust gases of this engine. Aside from the ludicrousness of a mass killing by means of diesel exhaust gases, how plausible this is, is shown by Friedrich Berg: 374 “The only way to realistically impose a significant load on any engine is by coupling to the engine some kind of brake dynamometer or other load, such as a generator with an electrical load, a fan, pump, or the like.” According to the witness Wiernik, it was just that engine of the electric power supply that was used in Treblinka in the gassings. This engine was thus doubly important; first, because it had to produce the carbon monoxide for the gassings, and second, because it generated the electrical energy indispensable for the needs of the camp. In fulfillin g the second function, the engine had to be in operation 24 hours every day. How can one conceive of the notion that the RSHA and the SS-WVHA could have been satisfied with a Russian engine for the fulfillment of this double function? The whole story sounds all the more silly in view of the fact that the emergency electric supply of the Auschwitz camp was equipped with an obviously new German diesel engine since November 1940. By commission of the local SS Central Construction Office, the firm of Georg Grabarz compiled a detailed estimate, of which we have photocopied the first page. 375 The costs for the engine amounted to 28,140 RM, that for the generator 24,464 RM, and the entire costs, including accessories and costs of transport, 56,218 RM. 376    373 R. Auerbach mentions a “ Russian tank engine ” ( op. cit. (note 29), p. 49) for Treblinka. Y. Wiernik speaks of a “ dismantled Soviet tank ” (in A. Donat, op. cit. (note 4), p. 157).

Gas Chambers or Asphyxiation Chambers? According to the verdict of the Dü sseldorf Jury Court of September 3, 1965, already cited, the gas chambers of the first killing installation measured 4 m × 4 m × 2.60 m each, thus 16 m 2 and 41.6 m 3 , and could each hold 200 to 350 people. Those of the second killing installation were 8 m × 4 m × 2 m, thus 32 m 2 and 64 m 3 in size, and could accommodate 400 to 700 persons. 377 The time period, during which a stay in gas-tight air-raid shelter (equipped with neither a ventilation nor an air-exc hange system) is possible without dan- ger to health and life, can be calculate d on the basis of the following formula: t = v/20n (10–0.4) = 0.48 (v/n) in which t stands for the time spent in the shelter, v for the volume of the room in cubic meters, n is the number of occupants of the room. The constant 20 designates the number of liters of carbon dioxide exhaled by a person within an hour, and 0.4 refers to the liters of carbon dioxide present per cubic meter of air. Lastly, 10 is the highest possible permissible concentration of carbon dioxide (per m 3 ) in the shelter. By heeding this formula, the suffocation of the occupants of the shelter can be avoided. It is well known that an adult normally exhales 4% carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Though this gas is not toxic, a concentration beyond a certain point leads to death through asphyxiation. On average, a standing adult breathes eight liters of air per minute and in doing so uses 0.360 liters of oxygen; dur- ing slow walking, however, his consum ption of oxygen climbs to 0.65 liters per minute and the air exhaled during the same period is increased to 14 liters. Since in breathing four parts of carbon dioxide are produced for 5 parts of oxygen, the person in the first instance produces (0.36 × 4/5 =) 0.288 liters of carbon dioxide per minute and in the second case (0.65 × 4/5 =) 0.520 liters of carbon dioxide per minute. 378 In regard to the effects of carbon dioxide upon people in relation to its con- centration, two specialists, Flury and Zernik, write: 379 “With 8-10%, corresponding to 144-180 mg/liter, loss of consciousness rapidly ensues and death follows from cessation of breathing with cyano- sis. Convulsions are insignificant or en tirely absent. The heart continues to beat after cessation of breathing. A concentration of 20%, or approxi- mately 360 mg/liter, leads within a fe w seconds to complete paralysis of the vital centers.”    377 This corresponds up to 22 persons per s quare meter – an absolute impossibility! 378 F.

In what time period would there have been such a concentration in the alleged gas chambers of Treblinka? Since there were also children among th e alleged victims – perhaps a third of the entire number 380 – and since the rate of respiration of the hypothetical victims would naturally have been accele rated by excitement, fear, and terror, we start our calculations with the assumption of an average carbon dioxide volume of 0.300 liters per person per minute 381 or 18 liters per person per hour, and with the average weight of each victim assumed to be 55 kg. 382 Gassing Installation 1: The number of victims per gas chamber amounted to 200 to 300, thus an average of 275. The volume occupied by the bodies of the victims amounted to ((275×550)÷1,000=) 15.1 m 3 ; therefore, there was a volume of (41.6– 15.1=) 26.5 m 3 of air available. In one minute the victims produced (275×0.3=) approximately 82.5 liters or 0.0825 m 3 carbon dioxide. The lethal concentration lies at 10% carbon dioxide, which corresponds to (26.5×0.1=) 2.65 m 3 or 2,650 liters. This thus o ccurs in (2,650÷82.5=) about 32 minutes. Gassing Installation 2: The number of victims per gas chamber amounted to 400 to 700, therefore an average of 550. The volume occupi ed by the bodies of the victims is (550×550÷1,000=) 30.2 m 3 ; thus a volume of (64–30.2=) approximately 34 m 3 is available. In one minute the vict ims produce (550×0.3=) approximately 156 liters or 0.165 m 3 carbon dioxide. The lethal c oncentration of 10% carbon di- oxide, that is, (34×0.1=) 3.4 m 3 or 3,400 liters, is con sequently attained in (3,400 ÷ 165 =) about 21 minutes. Conclusion: According to the witnesses, the victim s are supposed to have died from the gas after approximately 30 to 40 minut es, but death from asphyxiation would have already occurred after about 20 or 30 minutes. What good purpose, therefore, was served by the construction of diesel gas chambers?    380 According to the statistician Jakob Leszczy ń ski, in the year 1931 children comprised 29.6% of the population in Poland.

Rach el Auerbach wri- tes: 383 “For instance, we had believed for a long time that the final agony in the gas chambers, where most of our relatives and friends were asphyxi- ated, lasted just 20 to 25 minutes, or half an hour at the most. We have now learned from Jankiel Wiernik‘s account that the death throes in the new, larger gas chambers (in Treblinka) took longer than it had in the old chambers. In fact, they often went on for as long as one hour because the Russian tank motor which supplied the chambers with exhaust fumes did not put out gas sufficient to fill the larger space and the wider pipes. The output was not sufficiently large and effective.” This illuminates a gross error in planning, which would have been commit- ted by the SS if these claims were correct. The second gassing installation al- legedly had 10 gas chambers with a total volume of 640 m 3 , while the first had merely three gas chambers with a total volume of 124.8 m 3 . Therefore the volume of the second was approximately five times greater than that of the first. In order to kill the victims in the sa me time as in the first installation, the SS would consequently have had to install five engines in the second instead of a single one. In his report published in 1944, Wiernik had only written: 384 “The motor which generated the gas in the new chambers was defec- tive, and so the helpless victims had to suffer for hours on end before they died. Satan himself could not have devised a more fiendish torture.” Quite clearly, Wiernik‘s claim was pure atrocity propaganda: he wanted to create the notion that death in the new f acility was even more cruel than in the old one, because the SS was using a defec tive engine (or perhaps even had in- tentionally damaged it!), and on that account the victims had to endure a tor- ture such as the Devil incarnate would not have been able to invent a more diabolical one! If, as Wiernik maintains on the other hand, 10,000 to 12,000 people per day were gassed in Treblinka, 385 – or even, at times, 20,000 386 – then this cer- tainly does not comport with the ineffi ciency of the gas chambers, which was described by the same witness. Who can seriously believe that the RSHA, after its decision to change the killing system of the first gassing facility of Treblinka because it had proven to be too inefficient (as was likewise the case with Be łż ec and Sobibór), had allowed a new installation to be built, which functioned according to the same    383 A.

As always in such cases, the stupidity lies not with the SS, but rather with the eyewitnesses. 8. The Problem of Air Pressure in Gas Chambers According to the official historiogr aphy, the gas chambers possessed no opening for the removal of the gas. As we have seen in Section 2, the Soviet Investigating Judge Jurowski inserted an opening for gas outflow in the ceil- ing in both of his drawings of the gas chambers of Treblinka. In 1947, Elias Rosenberg stated for the record: 387 “A small window, sealed air-tight, was fitted to the ceiling, which could not be opened and through which the man who regulated the gas supply was able to observe.” This small window, therefore, had nothi ng to do with any system for gas removal. But such a window, or, to be more exact, such an opening for the purging of the air-gas mixture would have been absolutely indispensable for a mass killing by the use of the exhaust gases of a powerful engine. Graduate engineer Arnulf Neumaier emphasizes that diesel engines emit their combus- tion gases with a pressure of 0.5 atmospheres (which corresponds to 500 g/cm 2 ), and explains: 388 “ [...] this means that there would have been a force equivalent to the weight of 5 metric tons pushing outwa rd against each square meter of sur- face area.” In the first installation, such a pressu re would have exerted a force corre- sponding to the weight of 80 metric tons upon the ceiling of each chamber, of 52 metric tons on each of the walls, of 8.1 metric tons upon the entrance door and of 22.5 metric tons upon the door serving for the removal of the bodies. If the masonry of the walls withstood this powerful pressure, then the engine, approaching a state of equilibrium between the pressure of the interior of the chambers and the pressure of the engi ne exhaust gases, would have broken down. When would this equilibrium be r eached? The gas pressure in a hermeti- cally sealed container or room doubles if the amount of gas in it is doubled (provided the temperature is constant). A diesel engine works like a compressor. Under the parameters of the data given previously, an engine of 38,860 cu bic centimeters (38.86 liters) at 2,000 RPM emits 38.86 m 3 of gas per minute with an outlet pressure of 0.5 atmos- pheres.    387 E.

Number and Size of the Graves According to official historiography, about 860,000 of the 870,000 Treb- linka victims were buried before their cremation. 389 On the basis of his investigations of the mass graves of Hamburg (Anglo- American terror-bombardment of July 1943), Katyn (Soviet mass murder of Polish officers, 1940) and Bergen-Belsen (mass dying from typhus in spring 1945), John Ball came to the conclusion that one could assume a maximum of six bodies per cubic meter in a mass grave. 390 This number seems quite high if one keeps in mind that in Treblinka I, the work camp, the Soviets found 105 bodies in a grave with an effective volume of 75 m 3 – therefore 1.4 bodies per cubic meter, and that the medical expert Piotrowski, in his first calculation of the content of the mass graves, set a figure of six bodies per 2 cubic meters, thus 3 bodies per cubic meter, half the density proposed by Ball. 391 However, in order to take into account the hypothetical existence of children as compris- ing one-third of the victims, we assume a density of a maximum of 8 bodies per cubic meter.    389 According to Arad, op. cit. (note 72), p. 396, 7,600 people were gassed in August 1943 and directly cremated without an intervening period of burial. 390 John Ball, in: Germ ar Rudolf (ed.), op. cit.

In the two other mass grav es, the number of bodies per cubic meter was even lower."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 138 How many graves were there, and how large were they? The Düsseldorf Jury Court conceded at the trial of 1964-1965 that it had discovered no accu- rate information about this. In its verdict it says: 392 “The details determined in the ma in trial concerning the number and size of the body pits likewise differ very widely from one another. Neverthe- less, one can form an idea of the extent of the pits when one hears that, ac- cording to the statement of defendant S., one of the pits contained no less than approximately 80,000 corpses.” But according to the witness E. Rosenberg , who is the sole person to give ‘exact’ details, the mass graves measured 120 m × 15 m × 6 m, 393 which, if one assumes a top layer of 0.5 m, gives an effective volume of (120×15×5.5=) 9,900 m 3 . Consequently, each grave could contain (9,900×8=) 79,200 bodies, which agrees almost exactly with the comment above of the Düsseldorf Court. In accordance with this, if 860,000 bodi es were really buried in Treblinka before their cremation, there must ha ve been (860,000÷79,200=) 11 graves of this size, the total surface area of which amounted to (120 × 15 × 11 =) 19,800 m 2 . b. Site of the Mass-Graves According to the plan of Treblinka produced at the Düsseldorf trial of 1964-1965, the mass graves were located without exception inside of ‘Camp II,’ where there were, besides, the following facilities: the old gassing installa- tion, the new gassing installation, the two cremation grates and the barracks for the Jewish Sonderkommandos . But, as pointed out in Chapter II, the whole of ‘Camp II’ had an area, which was far less than the theoretical area of the graves, that is, 14,000 m 2 . ‘Camp II’ had the shape of an irregular quadrilateral; its sides measured 188, 110, 174, and 52 meters. It therefore could theoretically accommodate merely three graves of the dimensions given above. Due to the presence of the five facilities mentioned, however, of which three (the two cremation grates and the new gassing installation) were allegedly lined up with one another on an east-west axis, ‘Camp II’ could bare ly enclose a single one such mass grave for 79,200 bodies. Where, then, were the remaining 780,800 bodies bur- ied? In the plan mentioned, just five mass graves are drawn in ‘Camp II,’ which further complicates things, since each gr ave would then had to have had a far greater area than stated above.    392 A.

The Excavated Earth In excavating a pit or a grave, the extract has a volume which is normally around 10 to 25% greater than the volume of the excavated pit itself. 394 From each of the 11 mass graves of Trebli nka, (120×15×6=) 1,088 cubic meters of earth would have been excavated, thus in all (10,800×11=) 118,800 cubic me- ters. If we set the minimum of 10 % for the additional volume of the extracted earth, then the latter would have ha d a volume of (118,800×1.1=) approx. 130,700 cubic meters. For purposes of illu stration, let it be said that this enormous quantity of earth would have been able to cover the entire surface area of the Treblinka II camp with a layer nearly one meter high! If this mass were arranged in the form of a pile 6 m high, with sides each having an angle of 30 degrees and a width of 10 m, then its length would have amounted to (130,700÷30 ≅ ) 4.4 kilometers, covering some 44,000 m 2 ! If one should con- struct such a pile of soil next to each grave, then this would be some 390 m long each! d. A Comparison with the Ma ss-Graves of Treblinka I As shown in Chapter III, in the year 1944 the Soviets found three mass graves in the proximity of Treblinka I, and the Poles a further 41 in 1946. The latter possessed a total area of 1,607 m 2 . Not a single mass grave was discov- ered on the camp area itself, although this had a greater area than Treblinka II: approximately 18 hectares. 395 The graves were located in the for est of Maliszewa, about 500 m away from the camp. This was due to obvious considerations of hygiene and sanita- tion. The pollution of water, air, and soil by decomposing corpses had been proven scientifically a long time before the 1940s. Studies performed in the nineteenth century had shown that the ground water in the vicinity of cemeter- ies was often so severely contaminated th at the water in the wells was putrid, murky, and permeated by organic substa nces. In 1878, F. Selmi, Professor of Pharmaceutical and Toxicological Chemistry at the University of Bologna, discovered that in addition to ammonia, sulphuric acid, carbonic acid, and gaseous hydrocarbons, a toxic alkaloid is also generated through the decom- position of corpses, which he named ‘ptomaine.’ At about the same time, other scientists proved that cadavers develop yet another volatile toxic sub- stance, ‘sepsin.’ Moreover, it had alr eady long been experimentally proven that many pathogenic microorganisms in the soil – the cause of typhus fever    394 G.

On the plan of Treb- linka drawn by Moszek Laks and Maniek P ł atkiewicz, 398 four wells can be recognized, one for the German guard unit, one for the Ukrainian guard unit, one for the Jewish prisoners, and a fourth , which was surely located in ‘Camp II.’ There can therefore be no doubt that hundreds of thousands of bodies al- legedly buried in ‘Camp II ’ would have completely poisoned the ground wa- ter, which supplied the wells. Yet not a single witness mentions a thing about this critical problem. e. The Excavators of Treblinka According to the official version of history, the existence of huge mass graves is confirmed by the presence of th ree excavators in the camp, which at first are supposed to have been employed for the excavation of the graves and later for exhuming the corpses. Two phot os are often published in support of this claim, in which excavators – allege dly at a location in Treblinka II – can be recognized. One of these photos is reproduced in the work of Y. Arad with the caption: 399 “An excavator used in Treblinka to remove dead bodies to be burned, and the SS men who operated the excavator.” The other, better-known photograph appeared, inter alia, in the work of Gitta Sereny, where the caption claims that the excavator served to transport the corpses out of the trenches onto the grates. 400 This photo was also pub- lished in the book The Good Old Days with the caption: 401 “Excavator used for co rpses in Treblinka.” Samuel Willenberg’s book contains a picture of said excavator in action, dumping a load of – soil. The picture bears the caption: 402 “Crane lifting corpses for cremation.

Willenberg in the 1980s, in which on e sees a part of the camp with an ex- cavator in the background! 405 10. Early Cremations Y. Arad describes the early history of the alleged burning of bodies in Treblinka as follows: 406 “During Himmler‘s visit to the camp at the end of February/beginning of March 1943, he was surprised to find that in Treblinka the corpses of over 700,000 Jews who had been kille d there had not yet been cremated. The very fact that the cremation began immediately after his visit makes it more than possible that Himmler, who was very sensitive about the erasure of the crimes committed by Nazi G ermany, personally ordered the crema- ting of the corpses there. A cremation s ite was erected for this purpose in the extermination area of the camp.” Here Arad is simply repeating what Z. Ł ukaszkiewicz had written in the year 1945: 407 “In February or March 1943, Himmler visited the camp (witnesses: Poswolski, Stanis ł aw Kon, Wiernik, Kudlik, Reisszmann [sic] . Since this visit the bodies were cremated in mass.” This claim is untenable just as much from the standpoint of the witness tes- timony as it is historically invalid. Rajzman had stated in particular at his first interrogation on September 26, 1944: 408 “In the first months – as I was told – the bodies were buried and cov- ered with a layer of earth, at which point the dentists extracted the gold teeth as soon as the bodies were dragged out of the chambers.    403 R.

Clouds of smoke covered the sky over the camp to the point that we entered into a constant zone of dark- ness.” Rajzman came to Treblinka on September 27, 1942, which means that the cremation of bodies must have already begun in September of that year and not first in March 1943. On the other hand, the story of the Himmler visit to Treblinka is devoid of any sort of historical basis and is not even supported by a vague documentary reference. It is a simple invention of the witnesses in order to make their tales of enormous cremations in Treblinka a ppear credible, which for their part are supposed to lend credibility to their description of a gigantic mass extermina- tion in the camp. But historically viewed it is all sheer nonsense. According to official historiography, Himmler, at a point in time when Auschwitz, allegedly the largest of the German ‘extermination camps,’ began its murderous activity, is supposed to not have had the idea yet of building crematoria for the incineration of corpses: the victims of the so-called ‘bun- kers’ of Birkenau are supposed to have simply been buried in mass graves, which had been excavated in the ‘ Birkenwald’ (birch forest). Himmler is sup- posed to have ordered the cremation of bodies in Auschwitz after his second visit there on July 17 and 18, 1942. 409 As a result of this alleged Himmler or- der, the incineration of the bodies under the open sky is supposed to have be- gun on September 21, 1942. 410 But already in the month before his visit to Auschwitz, Himmler is sup- posed to have ordered the SS- Standartenführer Paul Blobel, through the Chief of the Gestapo, Heinrich Müller, to eradicate all traces of the mass graves: 411 “In June 1942 SS-Gruppenführer Müller, chief of the Gestapo, charged SS-Standartenführer Blobel with removing all traces of the mass execu- tions carried out in the east by the Einsatzgruppen. This order was consid- ered a state secret, and Blobel was instructed to refrain from any written correspondence on the subject. The op eration was given the code name ‘Sonderaktion (special operation) 1005.’” 412 Under these circumstances one does not comprehend, why corpses in Auschwitz were buried up until Septembe r 20, 1942, and in Treblinka up to March 1943; it is also incomprehensible, why cremations in Sobibór are sup-   409 Franciszek Piper, “ Gas Chambers and Crematoria ,” in: Israel Gutman, Michael Berenbaum (eds.), Anatomy of the Au schwitz Death Camp , Indiana University Press, Bloomington and Indianapolis 1994, p. 163. 410 D.

Or to put it differently, we understand it only too well: the witnesses of the different camps had not managed to get together to agree on an identical start- ing date for Himmler’s decision to eradicate all traces by cremation! 11. Cremation Facility Z. Ł ukaszkiewicz writes: 415 “In Treblinka there were no crematoria in the form of ovens, only primitive facilities in the form of grates.” Had Treblinka been a ‘pure exterminat ion camp,’ then it would have been the sheerest insanity not to construct crematoria. All important concentration camps – Dachau, Sachsenhausen, Buch enwald, Mauthausen, Flossenbürg, Neuengamme, Groß-Rosen, Niederhagen, Ravensbrück – were equipped with stationary or mobile crematorium fu rnaces. Lublin/Majdanek and Auschwitz- Birkenau, which supposedly functioned simultaneously as concentration and extermination camps, possessed several crematoria: the former camp had two of them with seven muffles altogether, 416 the latter five crematoria with a total of 52 muffles, even though not all at the same time. 417 Why should Himmler not even have provided for the buildin g of a single furnace for an alleged pure extermination camp? The situation sounds all the more cr azy, as on December 4, 1941, Himmler himself had ordered through the SS Ma in Office for Budget and Buildings “ 4 pieces of Topf 4-muffled double cremation furnaces ” from the Topf firm in Er- furt for the White Russian city Mogile w, which was then under German mili- tary administration 418 and where the transit camp for POWs no. 185 under the command of Major Wittmer was located. 419 But on December 30, 1941, merely half a furnace (four muffles) was shipped to Mogilew; two others were then installed in the crematoria IV and V of Auschwitz-Birkenau, and 1½ more ovens (12 muffles) remained temporarily in storage at the Topf firm for Himmler‘s disposal. 420 On August 16, 1943, the SS-Administrator at the Sen-   413 Y.

This situation has repeat- edly been the cause of complaints. The installation of a crematorium would be urgently needed.” Since there had been confusions about payments of invoices of the Topf firm, the SS-Administrator of Group C/Construction also addressed the office of the Senior SS- and Police Chief of Central Russia, since the ordering of the “ 4 pieces of Topf 4-muffled double cremation furnaces ” was intended for the Construction Inspection Office of Central Russia. 423 This affair is very typical. Above all, it allows us to see that as early as De- cember 1941 Himmler had ordered the installation of crematorium furnaces in one camp, which was located in the occupied territories under military ad- ministration. It also shows that the highest SS authorities of the General Gou- vernement and of the Soviet territories under military administration were in- terested in the installation of cremator ium furnaces. Next, it proves that the SS work camp Trawniki, in which never mo re than 10,000 prisoners were in- terned, had several times requested th e construction of a crematorium, but such a request was never made either for Treblinka, Be łż ec, or Sobibór, where such a thing would have been much more necessary, provided the official his- tory is correct. Finally, not even the SS-Administrator at the Senior SS- and Police Chief’s office in the General Gouvernement had ever ordered crema- tion furnaces for the three last-named camps, for he could have immediately received the 12 muffles that awaited their buyer in storage at the Topf firm. Let us summarize: By December 1941, the problem of the cremation of bodies had emerged in the concentration and prisoner-of-war camps. Cremato- ria were built in Mogilew, in Majdanek , and in all the larger concentration camps, but not in the alleged three pure extermination camps!

Can anyone really take such nonsense seriously? 12. Cremation a. Complexity of the Problem The matter of the missing crematoria is all the more grotesque, as the prob- lem of cremating the corpses would have been tremendous, if the official ver- sion of Treblinka corresponded to the facts. The Jewish US-historian Kon- nilyn G. Feig comments the following in this regard: 425 “The incredible complexity of the mass-grave problem frustrated the Germans. Their dismay was legitimate. Treblinka’s soil contained 700,000 bodies – a volume of 69,000 cubic me ters weighing 35,000 tons, the same as a medium size battleship. Even if 1,000 bodies could be burned each day, 700 days would elapse before Himmler’s order had been obeyed. Franz and Lalka [nick-name of an SS-officer] tried many approaches to the problem. They poured buckets of gasoline on the bodies in one ditch – producing huge flames and slightly si nged corpses. They piled one hundred bodies into wide but shallow ditches, and dumped in gasoline again. The resulting fire did not destroy the corpse s. They experimented with varying sizes of piles and quantities of gasoline – to no avail. At the end of the first testing period they concluded that Himmler‘s request would take 140 years to fulfill. As a second experiment, they built hug e pyres – alternating bodies and wood and soaking the whole with gasoline. The fire destroyed the bodies but the test could not be repeated, for it was wartime and gasoline and tree trunks were not available in the quantities necessary to burn 700,000 corpses.” Before we continue, we must correct the figures given here. If 700,000 bodies weighed 35,000 tons, then the average weight of a body was 50 kg and it occupied a volume of approximately 0.05 m 3 ; thus, the entire volume was 35,000 m 3 and not 69,000 m 3 . In our calculations, we are assuming the number of bodies to be 870,000 as given by Y. Arad and the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust and assume the aver- age weight to be 45 kg, since the co rpses would have been buried for many months, leading to a loss of weight by desiccation. Thus, the total weight of the bodies would have amounted to 39,150,000 kg and the volume occupied by them would have been 39,150 m 3 .    425 Konnilyn G. Feig, Hitler’s Death Camps. The sanity of madness , Holmes & Meier Publish- ers, New York-London 1981, pp. 306f."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 146 Feig goes on to say: 426 “Finally, the planners were forced to bring an expert, Herbert Floss. [...] Floss had the prisoners erect four cement pillars, 76 centimeters high, forming a rectangle 19 meters long and 1 meter wide. On top they laid railroad rails, and on the rails they piled several hundred bodies. Inmates called the two huge iron pyres ‘Roasts’. A witness suggested that primitive grills could hold 2,600 bodies.” In order to increase the efficiency of the grates, Floss introduced an impor- tant innovation to them. As Jean-François Steiner claims, whom Feig quotes, Floss had discovered during his experiments in particular that “the old bodies burned better than the new ones, the fat ones better than the thin ones, the women better than the men, and the children not as well as the women but better than the men.” Therefore, “ it was evident that the ideal body was the old body of a fat woman ,” and Floss had the bodies distributed according to these criteria. 426 Feig is thus not embarrassed to rep eat the crackpot claims of some wit- nesses, that women’s bodies burned spontaneously and served as fuel for the cremation of the rest of the bodies. 427 Hardly less ridiculous is the claim that the bodies of old men burn better than those of young men. In actuality, the truth is exactly the opposite: in the bodies of men weakened by age the com- bustible materials – fats and proteins – are already partly used up by the proc- ess of aging. But this is in essence a secondary issue. The main problem lies in the primitiveness of the burning technique. Can anyone in possession of his five senses actually accept the scenario that the Commandant of Treblinka, disre- garding the experiences with cremation accumulated by the SS in Auschwitz, engaged in amateurish experiments in executing an order personally issued by Himmler himself, as though the cremation of 870,000 were a local problem, to be solved by make-shift methods? No less abstruse is the notion that Himmler, who had at his disposal the best German engineers and technicians in the field of cremation – those of the firm of J.A. Topf & Söhne (Erfurt), Hans Kori (Berlin) and Didier Werke (Berlin), who had supplied the cremator ia furnaces to all the German concen- tration camps – sent a nobody by the name of Herbert Floss to Treblinka! b.

It c onsisted of a con- crete base approximately 70 cm thick, upon which 5 to 6 railroad rails of perhaps 25 to 30 m length lay at sm all intervals. Under the rails burned a fire, while 2,000 to 3,000 of the bodies of the Jews killed in the gas cham- bers were loaded on the grate and then burned. When it was seen that this system worked, the corpses, which had b een put into the body pits in the preceding months, were also retrieved, agai n with the help of a large exca- vator, and then likewise incinerated in the manner described.” According to the plan of Jankiel Wiernik from the year 1945 as well as that presented at the trial in Düsseldorf, 429 two such cremation facilities were in fact constructed. The cremation is s upposed to have taken place in the time period between April and the end of July 1943, 430 so that nearly all 860,000 bodies are supposed to have been incinerated within 122 days, i.e. 7,000 per day on two grates, or 3,500 per day per grate.

Donat, one reads: 431 “This is the way in which he [432] got the Inferno started: He put into op- eration an excavator which could dig up 3,000 corpses at one time. A fire grate made from railroad tracks wa s placed on concrete foundations 100 to 150 meters in length. The workers piled the corpses on the grate and set them on fire.” The particulars given here are clearly the fruit of a later insertion, since in the American translation of Wiernick’s writing compiled in 1944 it simply says: 433 “This is the way he got the hell started. He put a machine for exhuming the corpses into operation, which could, in one motion, dig up many, many dead bodies. A fire grate made of railway ties was la id out on cement foundations, and workmen had to pile the corpses on the grating and set them on fire” If one takes into consideration the fact that 3,000 bodies take up a volume of about (3,000×0.045 =) 135 m 3 , the claim, according to which the shovel of the excavator could be loaded with 3,000 bodies at a time, will evoke only amusement. The length of the grate (100 to 150 m) contradicts the trial docu- ments. According to Arad, the grate was 30 m wide, 434 but this too contradicts    429 See Documents 5 and 12 in the Appendix. 430 Y. Arad, op. cit. (note 72), p. 177.

The width given by Feig – one meter – is obviously impossible. Thus, the two grates cannot have been larger than 30 × 3 × 0.76 m each. As already explained, each grate must have burned 3,500 bodies every single day for 122 days. Let us now examine the consequences of this. c. Arrangement of the Corpses on the Cremation Grates The surface area of one grate amounted to 90 m 2 . In view of its structure, the bodies could only be placed cross-wise on it; it is therefore to be assumed that for one meter of length of the gr ate – which corresponds to three square meters – four bodies can be placed, two respectively to the right and left of the central axis. We are assuming, however , for each body a theoretical average surface area of the size of a rectangle of 1.75 m × 0.50 m, which also includes the necessary intervening space for the p assage of the products of combustion. On the entire grate, then, there is spa ce for a layer of (4 × 30 =) 120 bodies. If we start with a height of 30 cm per layer of bodies, if one placed 3,500 bodies at the same time on the grate, the resu lt would be (3,500÷120=) 29 layers of bodies with a total height of (29×0.3=) 8.7 m! According to the witness Henryk Reichm ann, five to six grates were built, each of which was able to accommodate 2,500 bodies at a time. 435 The witness Szyja Warszawski specified that each grate measured 10 m × 4 m. 436 It fol- lows from this that one could accommodate a layer of 46 bodies on each grate, and 2,500 bodies – picture this – would result in 54 layers, or a hill of bodies 16 m high! Even had the SS managed the feat of piling up 29 or even 54 layers of bod- ies on the grate, the train rails would have deformed under the load as well as from the heat, and the body-mountain would have soon caved in. d. Wood Requirement The space available beneath the grate was (0.76 m × 90 m 2 =) 68.4 m 3 . The weight of a cubic meter of normally stacked firewood lies between 340 and 450 kg. Let us assume the highest value here; then (68.4×450 =) 30,780 kg of wood can fit in the 68.4 m 3 .

Time required for the incineration of one kilogram of animal flesh: ap- proximately 6 minutes. Amount of wood burned per square meter per one hour (until flames extin- guish): approximately 80 kg. Wood ashes resulting: approximately 8% of the total weight. Specific weight of wood ashes: approximately 0.34 g/cm 3 . On the basis of this data one can cal culate that the cremation of one body of 45 kg requires approximately 160 kg of seasoned wood. Consequently, in order to incinerate 3,500 bodies, (3 ,500×160=) 560,000 kg of wood is neces- sary, but there was room for merely 30.780 kg under the grate, therefore seven times less than required. Therefore, no more than (30.780÷3,500=) 8.8 kg of wood would have been allotted to one body, a ridiculously insufficient amount. Let us even suppose that it were feasible in some way or other to con- stantly pack new wood under the grate. In what period of time would the 560,000 kg of wood have been consumed by burning? In fires with fixed grate and more na tural ventilation, 150 to 190 kg of sea- soned, chopped wood can be burned pe r square meter of grate per hour. 439 But this applies only to an actual cremat ion apparatus with burning chamber, grate, a more adjustable air supply for burning, and chimney. With a pyre in the open, these values decline markedly . We therefore assume a sustainable value of 80 kg per square meter in our experiment. This means that in one hour (90×80= ) 7,200 kg of wood could be burned under the pile of bodies in one hour. In order to burn the 560,000 kg of wood necessary for incineration of the bodi es, (560,000÷7,200=) approximately 78 hours is required, thus more than three days. If one adds the time needed for cooling down of the pyre, one cremation session can take place every five days. Therefore, the 122 cremation sessions of 7,000 bodies each – which is the prerequisite for the disposal of 860,000 bodies using two grates – requires a time period of (122×5=) 610 days. The burning time computed here corresponds to (78÷29=) 2.5 hours per layer of bodies. In the case of a pyre with 29 layers of bodies, however, this time period is not sufficient, as a comparison with the crematorium furnace of    437 Arnulf Neumaier, op. cit.

With this type of furnace, a cremation lasted from one-and-a-half to two hours. 440 In the case of the pyre previously described, the flames and the products of combustion come in direct contact only with the layer of corpses lying directly on the grate and exert their effects upon any layer lying above that with an in- tensity quickly dwindling toward the vanishing point, so that a burning-time of 2.5 hours per level is totally unrealizable. Therefore, had the cremation of 860,000 bodies in Treblinka been initiated at the beginning of April 1943, then under the most favorable conditions it would have ended in December 1945, and the Soviets as well as His Honor Judge Ł ukaszkiewicz would have been able to personally attend the perform- ance! e. Ashes If we assume the value determined in our experiment of 160 kg of wood per 45 kg of organic substance, the qua ntity of wood necessary for the incin- eration of all bodies amounts to (870,000×160=) 139,200,000 kg or 139,200 metric tons. The ashes from combustion resulting from this would have been (139,200×0.08=) approximately 11,100 metr ic tons and occupied a volume of (11,100÷0.34 =) approximately 32,600 m 3 . The ashes resulting from cremation of a body weigh approximately 5% of the body weight and have a specific weight of approximately 0.5 g/cm 3 . 441 Thus, from 870,000 bodies having an average weight of 45 kg, a mass of (870,000×45×0.05÷1,000=) approximately 1,950 tons of ashes results, which has a volume of (1,950÷0.5=) 3,900 m 3 . The total weight of the wood ashes and the ashes from incineration of the bodies therefore amounts to (11,100+1,950=) approximately 13,000 metric tons, which occupy a volume of (32,600+3,900=) 36,500 m 3 . To what location was this enormous quantity of ashes brought? Y. Arad writes: 442 “Ultimately it was decided to dump the ash and bits of bone into the ditches that had previously held the bodies and to cover them with a thick layer of sand and dirt. The ash was sca ttered in the pits in several layers, interspersed with layers of sand. The to p 2 meters of the pit were filled with earth.”    440 G.

The claim of the Polish-Soviet commission of September 1944, according to whom the sin- gle connecting road between Treblinka I and Treblinka II “ was covered with cinders and ashes to a height of 7 - 10 cm ,” would result in a maximum vol- ume of (3,000m×4m×0.1m =) 443 1,200 m 3 . But Ł ukaszkiewicz made no state- ment referring to this, and it would have been a rather stupid attempt to ‘eradi- cate’ the traces on the part of the SS-men of Treblinka anyway. Lastly, this claim contradicts even the witness te stimony, according to which the ashes were poured into the mass graves in toto . Thus, for example, Y. Wiernik writes: 444 “It was our job to fill in the empty ditches with the ashes of the cre- mated victims, mixed with soil, in ord er to obliterate all traces of the mass graves.” f. Wood Supply From where did the administration of the Treblinka camp obtain the 139,200 metric tons of wood, which were required for the incineration of the bodies? According to the witnesses, trees in th e nearby forest were felled for the wood supply. The work was performed by a “ Holzfällerkommando ” (wood- felling unit). 445 But the witness reports are extremely vague about the details, which one can well understand. During a period of 122 days, this party would have had to chop with axes and hatche ts, saw up and haul into the camp (139,200÷122=) 1,140 tons of wood every day ! This means that every day it had to fell, disbranch and saw up at least 760 trees and transport the load on 76 trucks with 15 metric tons each. This is decidedly too much, especially if one considers that this wood-felling part y is supposed to have consisted, ac- cording to R. Glazar, of merely 25 men. 87 The environs of Treblinka are today overgrown with fir trees. A 50-year- old fir forest yields 496 tons of wood per hectare. 446 For the sake of simplicity, we round this number to 500 tons. In order to obtain 139,200 tons of wood, the SS people would therefore have had to cut down (139,200÷500=) 278.4 hectares of forest, which corresponds to 2,7 square kilometers!

On the other hand, in the aerial phot ographs of May and November 1944 a thick forest of approximately 100 hectares can be recognized on the north and east side of the camp, of which at least one hectare is located on the camp area itself. 447 The forest stretches beyond the Wólka Okr ą glik-Treblinka road and borders this for an extent of over 2 ki lometers. There is no trace of any area where trees have been felled. The plan drawn by Jankiel Wiernik in 1945 shows a large forested zone in the northeast sector, not far from the two grates in the southeast sector. From whence came, then, the 139,200 tons of wood, the acquisition of which re- quired approximately 92,800 trees? g. Lack of Documentary Evidence for Cremations These kinds of enormous pyres, had they actually existed, would obviously have been immediately conspicuous in the area surrounding Treblinka. In ref- erence to this, the witness Kazimierz Skarzy ń ski explained: 448 “The bodies were piled on the rails and burned. The glow of the fire was visible at a distance of 15 km. Du ring the day, a black smoke spread. With a strong wind, the smell of burni ng was still perceptible 30 km away from the camp.” As pointed out in our Introduction, the Treblinka camp was surrounded by quite a number of villages and hamlets. Within a radius of 10 km were the small towns of Wólka Ogr ą lik, Poniatowo, Grady, Treblinka, Ma ł kinia, Zawi- sty Dzikie, Rostki Wlk., Rytele, Ś wieckie, Olechny, Wszo ł ki, Jakubiki, Tosie, Kosów Lacki, D ę be, Ż ochy, Rostki, Maliszewa, Gu ty, Bojewo, Brzózka, Ko- ł odzia ż , Orze ł ek, Z ł otki, Prosty ń , Kie ł czew. From every single one of these villages and hamlets one would have seen the glow of the flames from Treblinka for 122 days – how does it happen that there is no mention of this in any of the reports of the Polish resistance move- ment? And how is it that the Soviet rec onnaissance planes discovered no trace of this gigantic cremation operation? Jankiel Wiernik supplies the following ex- planation for this: 63 “Whenever an airplane was sighted overhead, all work was stopped, the corpses were covered with foliage as camouflage against aerial obser- vation.” This, of course, is outrageous nonsense, since in the first place the planes would already have noticed the smoke of the grates long since, by the time that they themselves were visible fro m the camp, and in the second place due    447 U.

Witness Testimonies about Cremations That such a mass cremation of many hundred thousands of bodies was not a real event follows, finally, from the glaring contradictions between the dif- ferent eyewitness narratives. As already mentioned, according to the official version of Treblinka, which was ultimately agreed upon, there were supposedly two cremation grates of 30 m × 3 m in size, which were located on the grounds of the camp and which could respectively incinerate up to 3,500 bodies. However, in the original ver- sion, the witnesses had the grates in the trenches. According to Szyja War- szawski, the cremation facility, whic h was incorrectly termed by him a “ fur- nace ” was 449 “ [...] a pit 25 m in length, 20 m wide, and 5-6 m deep, with a grate out of rails on the bottom of the pit, which constituted an air vent.” Abe Kon stated for the record: 450 “ [The bodies] were burned in a specially manufactured furnace, which could hold up to 6,000 bodies. The furnace was filled with bodies. These had gasoline and petroleum poured over them and were burned. The cre- mation lasted up to an hour.” Apart from Abe Kon himself, the witnesses Hejnoch Brenner and Samuel Rajzman agreed upon the following version: 451 “The furnace – that was a large trench 200-300 m long and 5-6 m deep, excavated with an excavator. Three rows of reinforced concrete poles one- and-a-half meters high each were driven into the bottom of the trench. The poles were connected with one anot her by crossbeams. On these cross- beams were laid rails at intervals of 5 to 7 cm. This was a giant furnace grate. Narrow-gauge tracks were brought up to the edges of the trench.” This variation was also adopted by Wassili Grossmann, who made his courtesy visit to Treblinka in September 1944 and was able to speak with the witnesses already questioned by the Soviets. 452 But there would not have been room for such an enormous grate on the property of ‘Camp II’ of Treblinka II, whose longest side was just 188 m.    449 GARF, 7021-115-11, p. 16. 450 Statement of August 1944, GARF, 7021-115-9, p. 33. 451 Report of August 24, 1944, GARF, 7021-115-9, p. 109. 452 W.

According to the witness Henryk Reichm ann, five to six grates were in- stalled, each of which was able to hold 2,500 bodies at a time. 453 Witness Szyja Warszawski maintained that each grate measured 10 m × 4 m. 454 We have already underlined the fact that under these conditions 46 layers of bod- ies would have to have been piled up on one grate; with 2,500 bodies, 54 or a mountain of bodies 16 m high would have been necessary! Jankiel Wiernik writes that a grate – which presumably was located on the camp grounds – could burn 3,000 bodies at one time. 431 The total capacity of all grates amounted, according to him, to 10,000 to 12,000 bodies. 455 This ob- viously contradicts the camp plan draw n by the same witness, in which merely two grates are to be seen. 456 At the end of July 1943 – once again according to Wiernik – 75% of the bodies from the mass graves are supposed to have been cremated, with 25% still remaining. Wiernik was not embarrassed to claim: 444 “Within a few days work was begun to empty the remaining 25 per cent of the graves and the bodies were cremated.” In view of the fact that on the 2nd of August, the day of the revolt, the cremation is already supposed to have b een finished, this means that a quarter of the bodies must have been cremated within a maximum of ten days. Wiernik maintains silence about the exact number of victims of the camp, but speaks of “ millions of people ,” 457 which corresponds to a minimum of two million; in the report of November 15, 1942, which he brazenly plagiarized, there was also mention of two million, which had allegedly been exterminated in Treblinka just up to that time. According to his claims, therefore, in not more than ten days 500,000 bodies – a quarter of these two million – were transformed into ashes, although the grates could manage at most, according to his own statements, 12,000 bodies per day or 120,000 in ten days! The idiocies dished up by this witn ess are really beyond description. Wiernik gives every indication of being the author of the story of the sponta- neous combustion of bodies, later taken up by his cronies: 63 “It turned out that bodies of women burned more easily than those of men. Accordingly, the bodies of wo men were used for kindling the fires.” Let us remind ourselves once again that the entire version of the history of Treblinka accepted today was put out into the world by exactly this Jankiel Wiernik!    453 Statement of December 1945, in: Z.

Number of Those Gassed Daily In Chapter III, we have shown the unbe lievable lack of capacity for critical judgment of the official historiography relative to the enormous technical problems, which would have been entailed in an extermination of the claimed number of Jews in Treblinka. In this regard, the claims of the witnesses verge upon pure insanity. For instance, Abe K on has the nerve to make the follow- ing statement: 458 “In this way, they exterminated 15,000 to 18,000 persons a day. It went on like that for two months.” Stainslaw sings the same tune: 459 “Within 13 months they killed 15, 000 to 18,000 people there.” At his interrogation of September 26, 1944, Samuel Rajzman stated: 460 “Every day 5-6 transports with 60 boxca rs each arrived in the camp. Of course, there were days on which 1-2 trai ns arrived, but that was an excep- tion, not the rule. Six to seven thous and people arrived with each trans- port.” This corresponds to 24,000, even 28,000 people daily! In 1946, Rajzman named figures with the same order of magnitude: 461 “Every day there were about 20,000 corpses. [...] There were days, on which up to 25,000 people were killed.” A further witness, Stanis ł aw Borowy, gave to protocol that 12,000 to 18,000 deportees arrived daily in trains with 60 boxcars with 150 to 200 occu- pants each. 462 Jankiel Wiernik wrote: 463 “Between ten and twelve thousand people were gassed each day. [...] there were periods when as many as 30,000 people were gassed in one day.” Incredibly, these insanities were accepted by the court of a western Euro- pean nation as unvarnished truth! In the verdict of the Düsseldorf Jury Court, ref. 8 I Ks 2/64, p. 88, one Manfred Blank declared: 464 “In Treblinka many times up to 5 trans ports with an average of 6,000 people each arrived in one day.”    458 GARF, 7021-115-11, p. 33. 459 GARF, 7021-115-11, p. 35. 460 GARF, 7445-2-126, p. 240. 461 Wydawnictwo Centralnej Ż ydowskiej Komisji Historycznej (ed.), Dokumenty i Materia ł y , op. cit.

In accord with the transport lists produced by Y. Arad, from July 22 to Septem- ber 30, 1942, thus within a period of 70 days, approximately 500,000 Jews were deported to Treblinka and murdered there, although at that time only the first of the two gassing installations is supposed to have existed. This corre- sponds to a figure of more than 7,100 gassings per day! Since, according to the verdict of the above mentioned Dü sseldorf trial, each of the three gas chambers could hold a maximum of 350 pe rsons and thus the total capacity of the three chambers amounted to 1,050 persons, that would have meant no less than seven gassing operations per day pe r chamber, each of which would had to have taken less than three-and-a-ha lf hours. According to the witnesses, however, the chambers were never in op eration 24 hours a day, not even when 20,000 victims per day were coming in! In A. Donat‘s anthology, we read: 465 “On such days the gas chambers were in operation until 1 a.m. and fin- ished off more than 20,000 corpses within 24 hours.” The number of persons assumed by the Düsseldorf Jury Court to have been gassed at one time (21 to 22 people per s quare meter) is of course unrealistic and was only specified, because otherwi se the astronomical number of people gassed given by the witnesses would never have been attained.

Under these conditions, one gassing procedure, including all the accompanying measures like filling and emptying the chambers, would have had to have been completed in something over 1½ hours, and this would have to be done day in and day out for a period of 70 days! This sort of thing should have been met with roars of contemptuous laugh- ter, but Gerald Reitlinger and Jean-Cla ude Pressac are the only representatives of the official historiography who have had mustered the necessary minimum of courage to reject this insult to sound human reason!    465 A.

This amounts to a Wehrmacht bill of lading with the date “ Treblinka, the 13th of September 1942 ,” which refers to the sending of 50 train cars to Lublin with “ articles of clothing of the Waffen-SS ,” and a Wehrmacht bill of lading with the date “ Treblinka, the 10th of September 1943 ,” which relates to the sending of a train car to Lublin with 5,200 kg of shoes. 467 There is nothing in the documents themselves, which indicates that this material is actually the property of deported Jews. This is particularly im- probable in the case of the “ articles of clothing of the Waffen-SS ,” since the Waffen-SS had no relationship to the Tr eblinka camp, and furthermore it is not clear what use the Waffen-SS would have for a collection of used civilian clothing. Perhaps the articles of clothing mentioned are simply Waffen-SS uniforms, which were being reloaded on their return from the eastern front for the purpose of cleaning/delousing/sorting. Samuel Rajzman furnished very exact information concerning the quantity of the Jewish property taken over by th e Germans in another camp. He writes in this regard: 468 “One of our organizers was the overseer of the detachment, in which 12-15 men were employed in the sortin g of money and valuables, in deter- mining the worth of objects of value and in packing them. In doing this, he had to submit a report to the Germans daily. He informed us about the weekly inventories. Approximately once a week we compared the entries of each worker. From October 1, 1942 – August 2, 1943, the following were transported to Germany: 25 railroad cars with women’s hair 248 cars of various clothing 100 cars of shoes 22 cars of textiles 46 cars of pharmaceutical and chemical preparations 4 cars of surgical and medical instruments 260 cars of blankets, pillows, carpets and traveling-rugs 400 cars with various objects (spectacles, gold fountain pens, fountain pens, combs, dishes, cases, umbrellas etc.).” In a “ classification of the quantity of used textiles delivered from the Lublin and Auschwitz camps by order of the Head Administrative Office of SS Eco-   467 J.

Arad gives this comme ntary on this document: 470 “This report relates to the textile materials transferred during 1942. That year the majority of deported Jews were sent to the death camps of Operation Reinhard rather than to Au schwitz; therefore, these camps were the main source of the textiles mentioned in Pohl‘s report.” In order to convince his readers even further, Arad publishes a photograph, which shows an enormous pile of shoes and is deceptively captioned “ A pile of shoes and boots in Belzec. ” 471 In reality, the photo shows a barracks of the stored personal effects in Birkenau! 472 Let us quickly examine: a. Hair Georges Wellers remarks concerni ng the document mentioned above: 473 “At the beginning of February 1943, a railway car with textile goods was sent from the Belzec camp to the Economics Ministry of the Reich (doc. no. 1257 and U.S.S.R. 511). The weight of the women’s hair by itself corresponds to the hair from 200,000 women.” Thus, with regard to the origin of the car, Wellers makes the same mislead- ing statements as did Arad later on. Were his claim correct, then the hair of one woman would weigh 15 grams. The twenty-five cars mentioned by Rajzman would then correspond to the ha ir of (25×3.000/0.015 =) five million women! But Wellers’ assumption is erroneous, because the hair of male and female prisoners was continually re-cut in all German concentration camps for hygienic reasons. For example, on October 11, 1944, Anton Kaindl, Kom- mandant of the concentration camp Sachsenhausen, felt compelled to call the entire camp, particularly the infi rmary building, to order because “the hair-cutting in the camp, and also on the part of the infirmary, has not been performed according to regulations.” He therefore ordered “ under threat of the harshest punishment” :    469 NO-1257. 470 Y.

All members of the remaining nations are to cut the hair short. ” Kaindl particularly complained “ that a large portion of the infirmary staff believes that they need not execute the orders of the camp ” and reminded them that “ this important wartime economic camp rule ” was to be enforced “ with- out a single exception .” How large the quantity of cut hair was, emerges from the last transport, which weighed 275 kg. 474 These 3,000 kg of hair, which was transported in the railway car men- tioned, was therefore the harvest of a series of haircuts of the prisoners of Auschwitz and Lublin in 1942. b. Shoes The Wehrmacht bill of lading of September 10, 1943, speaks of the dis- patching of a railway car with 5,200 kg of shoes of unknown origin to Lublin. To how many pairs does this correspond? If one assumes an average weight of 260 grams for each pair of shoes, then 5,200 kg amount to 20,000 pairs of shoes. If one had taken the shoes from all the Jews (allegedly) deported to Treblinka, then the 870,000 pairs of shoes would have had a weight of (870,000×0.260=) 226,200 kg, and (226 ,200÷5,200=) 43.5 railway cars would have been required! It is known that the Soviets found about 800,000 pairs of shoes in the Lub- lin/Majdanek camp. The Polish historian Czes ł aw Rajca, who is on the staff of the Majdanek Museum, writes regarding this: 475 “It was assumed that this [the quantity of shoes] came from prisoners killed in the camp. From documents, wh ich later came to light, we know that in Majdanek there was a depot, to which shoes were sent from other camps.” c. Articles of Clothing Insofar as the 50 railway cars with “ articles of clothing of the Waffen-SS ” are concerned, which were mentioned in the Wehrmacht bill of lading dated “ Treblinka, the 13th of September 1942 ,” they would have contained 337.5 metric tons of clothes altogether, or 6¾ in each boxcar, if we assume the same amount per railway car as listed above fo r the rags (2,700t/400). However, if each of the (allegedly) 870,000 Jews deporte d to Treblinka had worn or (along with extra clothing, pillows, and blankets) carried with him 10 kg worth of ar- ticle of clothing, and had these mountains of clothing been collected after the murder of the victims, then this woul d have amounted to 8,700 metric tons,    474 GARF, 7021-104-8, p. 1. 475 C.

They furnish not the least bit of proof for a mass extermination in Treblinka. In Lublin, incidentally, there were still other facilities for the collection and recycling of textiles. The most important of these were the “ Lublin Fur and Clothing Workshops ,” which took in clothing from various camps. If the documents detailed above act ually report on confiscated Jewish property, then they prove at most that the SS, within the framework of opera- tion Reinhardt, confiscated a small portion of Jewish belongings in Treblinka either arbitrarily or because the maximum permissible luggage weight was ex- ceeded.

Confessions as a Basis for Historiography In 1979, Gitta Sereny mounted a furi ous attack against revisionists, par- ticularly against Arthur R. Butz. She ma de reference to he r conversations con- ducted in 1971 with former Treblinka Commandant Franz Stangl, who was incarcerated in a Düsseldorf jail and who, according to her claims, had admit- ted the mass murders in that camp; she wrote: 476 “Stangl is dead. But if [...] Butz [...] actually had been interested in the truth, Stangl‘s wife and many others would have been at his disposal to bear witness.” Butz could have indicated in his response that G. Sereny was unable to prove what the actual statements of Stangl were, due to the lack of a taped re- cord, but he nonetheless made an argument from an entirely different perspec- tive: 477 “We do not need ‘confessions’ or ‘trials’ to determine that the bomb- ings of Dresden and Hiroshima, or th e reprisals at Lidice following Hey- drich‘s assassination, really took place. Now, the extermination legend does not claim a few instances of homicid e, but alleges events continental in geographical scope, of three years in temporal scope, and of several million in scope of victims. How ludicrous, then, is the position of the bearers of the legend, who in the last analysis will attempt to ‘prove’ such events on the basis of ‘confessions’ delivered under the fabric of hysteria, censorship, intimidation, persecution, and blatant illegality that has been shrouding this subject for 35 years.

In what follows we will explain how the legal systems of the Federal Republic of Ge rmany and of Israel have sought to strengthen the traditional image of Treblinka by means of trials, at which con- fessions by alleged offenders and eyewit ness narratives comprised the sole ba- sis of evidence. 2. West German Treblinka Trials In a trial conducted in Düsseldorf from October 1964 to September 1965, ten persons, among them Kurt Franz w ho was described as the last Comman- dant of the camp, 478 were charged with participation in the alleged mass kill- ing of Jews in Treblinka. Four of th e defendants, Franz among them, were sentenced to life imprisonment for the collective murder of 300,000 persons and for a number of individual murders; a fifth defendant received the same punishment for the collective murder of at least 100,000 people; prison sen- tences of twelve, seven, six, four, and three years were imposed on five others accused for assisting in the collective murder of 300,000 or 100,000 persons, respectively. At a further Treblinka trial, which took place from May to December 1970, likewise in Düsseldorf, only one defendant appeared before the court, namely the former SS- Hauptsturmführer and second Treblinka Kommandant Franz Stangl. The latter was sentenced to the loss of liberty for the rest of his life for the murder, committed together with othe rs, of at least 400,000 Jews, but he died in 1971 before the German Federa l Supreme Court had decided about the appeal filed by him. At the first of these two proceedings more than 100 and at the second more than 50 witness were heard in and outsid e of Germany. Adalbert Rückerl, at    478 In a letter written on January 3, 1976, Kurt Franz, who continually protested his innocence, strongly denied having been ca mp Commandant. He wrote: “ I served in Treblinka with the military rank of a Oberscharführer of the Wa ffen-SS responsible exclusively only for the guard detachment and with the men for the guard ing of the camp. An Oberscharführer is a Technical Sergeant and not an officer! ” The letter is printed in no. 44 of the Historische Tatsachen (note 105) on p. 23. Kurt Franz, who was charged with participation in the murder of 300,139 Jews, had lived in Düsseldorf under his own name up to 1959. (A. Rückerl, NS- Vernichtungslager... , op. cit. (note 62), pp. 44f.); therefore he obviously had a good con- science and it had never occurred to him that he could be accused of anything! Only in 1993 was he released, a gravely ill and broke n man, after decades of imprisonment."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Chapter V: Treblinka Trials 163 that time Director of the Ludwigsburg Central Office for the resolution of Na- tional-Socialist crimes, documented these trials as well as those of the mem- bers of the camp staff of Be łż ec, Sobibór, and Che ł mno in his already men- tioned book NS-Vernichtungslager im Spiegel deutscher Strafprozesse (NS extermination camps as reflected in th e German criminal trials), which was published in 1977. This book cites long passages from the verdicts. In his in- troduction to Rückerl‘s work, Martin Bro szat, Director of the Munich Institute for Contemporary History, wrote 479 “Without wishing to anticipate an historical investigation and assess- ment of the role of German justice system in the prosecution of NS crimes, one thing can be maintained already t oday to be the result, also of the ac- tivity of the Central Office [in Ludwigsburg] : the significance of the exten- sive prosecutorial and judicial investigations, which began in this area at the end fifties in the Federal Republic [of Germany] , cannot be measured just by their – often low – quota of sentences. In particular regarding in- vestigations and proceedings dealing with mass killings of Jews [...] , the systematic clearing up of the aggregate of crimes had a general public and historical relevance extending considerably beyond the criminal prosecu- tion. [...] Although the fact of the ‘Final Solution to the Jewish Question’ is noted in nearly all history and school books about the NS period, the in- dividual modalities of this horrible even t have scarcely been systematically documented up until now. Their methodi cal concealment by the adminis- trative departments of the regime and the thorough eradication of the traces after the conclusion of the opera tions, above all in the carefully hid- den large extermination camps in th e occupied Polish territories, have made it difficult or have hindered an exact reconstruction of the events. Despite an unfavorable point of departure, the years-long painstaking work of the judicial investigation have finally led to broad clarity of the facts and connections.” First of all, it ought to be str essed that Broszat‘s claim that “ the large ex- termination camps in the occupied Polish territories ” were “ carefully hidden ” is blatant nonsense. Auschwitz was situ ated in an industrial zone swarming with civilian workers, and the prisoners constantly were coming into contact with them; Majdanek directly bordered on the city of Lublin, so that from their houses at the edge of the city people were able to look into the camp; in Treblinka, the farmers cultivated their fields almost directly up to the fencing of the camp, and the brisk trade, alr eady described by former inmates, be- tween the prisoners and the civilian population 480 guaranteed a steady flow of information from the camp into the outside world.    479 Adalbert Rückerl, NS-Vernichtungslager... , op. cit.

Broszat. When he writes that the “ individual modalities of the horrible events ” have “ scarcely been systematically documented up until now ,” but “ the years-long painstaking work of the judicial investigation” have “ led to a broad clarity of the facts and connections ,” then this means in plain words that the historiography up until then had not investigated the events in Treb- linka and the other ‘pure extermination ca mps,’ but had left that task up to the Law. Now, it is by no means the purview of the judge to write history; he has, instead, to make a finding about the guilt or innocence of a defendant. The mission of the judge is therefore a fundamentally different one from that of the historian. Yet whoever studies the ‘Holocaust’ literature very soon recognizes that this is based upon court verdicts to a decisive degree: for example, in the chapter devoted to the ‘extermination ce nters,’ in his three-volume ‘standard work’ The Destruction of the European Jews , R. Hilberg cites Adalbert Rück- erl‘s NS-Vernichtungslager im Spiegel deutscher Strafprozesse as a source no fewer than forty-one times. 481 Under these circumstances, the actual purpose of the countless trials of the ‘Nazi cr iminals’ conducted in West Germany emerges quite clearly: they served to retrospectively conjure up the desired evidence for million-fold murder in ga s chambers on the basis of eyewitness narratives and confessions by alleged culprits, evidence, which historiography was unable to produce and has not been able to produce right down to the pre- sent day, due to the lack of documents and material traces. Hilberg and his consorts were then able to refer to the results of these criminal trials in their accounts of the ‘Holocaust.’ In view of the eminent political significance of the trials as outlined here, a former SS-man sitting in the dock, who wa nted a chance at an acquittal or at least a lenient sentence, would naturally not be permitted to dispute the image of the concentration camp as portrayed in the charges, but rather at most deny his own personal guilt or, in case the witnesses incriminated him too much, would claim that he had to follow orders. Even if it is correct, what Rückerl writes on p. 25, that the defendants have “ without exception admitted their participation in the killing of Jewis h men, women and children, conducted on an industrial scale in the camps named ,” 482 then this can easily be explained as having been done for opportunistic reas ons: if an accused defendant did not do this, then this was interpreted as ‘obs tinate denial’ and resulted in a harsher sentence. On the other hand, if a defe ndant played along with the scenario of    481 With regard to this cf. Jürgen Graf, op. cit.

A succinct example of this is furnis hed by the case mentioned by Rückerl: The former SS- Hauptscharführer Josef Oberhauser, during the war stationed in Be łż ec, was put on trial in Munich in 1965. Although he was found guilty of assisting in the collective murder of 300,000 people during this trial, which lasted only four days, he nevertheless go t away with an incr edibly lenient sen- tence of merely 4½ years imprisonment: 483 “In the main proceedings, Oberhauser refused to make any statements in the case [he took the ‘fifth’] . He referred to the necessity of following orders.” This meant that he was not contes ting the extermination of Jews in Be łż ec; thus once again, the West German justice administration could triumphantly point out that the defendant had not denied the mass murder at all. Since Oberhauser, as Rückerl informs us, 484 had been taken into investigative cus- tody in 1960, in 1965 his sentence was considered served and he was probably released shortly after the verdict had been announced. Had he ‘obstinately de- nied’ the alleged crimes, he probably would have faced a life term sentence! 485 The witness testimony and confessions of defendants, the sole basis upon which the West German justice administration could support its case in these trials, were accepted as ‘credible’ in all cases where they jibed with the charges. Thus, with regard to an ‘expe rt opinion’ of historian Helmut Kraus- nick, who had given the numbe r of victims of the camp as at least 700,000, the verdict of the first Treblinka trial reads: 486 “The Jury Court has no reservations in following the expert, who is well-known as a scholar due to his research into the National-Socialist persecution of the Jews, since his expert opinion is detailed, thorough, and persuasive. This is all the more so when several defendants, among them the defendant S., who is gifted with an especially good memory, figured the number of victims at far more than 500,000. On what scale Treblinka op- erated, emerges from a characteristic description of the defendant S. con- cerning the opening of one of the body p its.

Such horrific atrocities were imputed to him that many objected to his sentence of 14 years imprisonment as inappr opriate. Yet only four months later, Mulka was released without an y fuss: G. Reitlinger, op. cit. , (note 181), p. 551. 486 A. Rückerl, NS-Vernichtungslager... , op. cit.

[487] On this occasion, so S. relates, his comrade P., the deputy head of the death camp, explained that this one body pit alone contained approximately 80,000 dead . Since there were several body pits, and since the extermination operation by no means was ended in the be- ginning of 1943, one can see in this description by S. nothing but a confir- mation of the expert opinion, which assumes a minimum of 700,000 per- sons killed.” What is to be thought of a justice administration, which relies upon rumors and hearsay in a trial dealing with the murder of at least 700,000 – “ S. relates that his comrade explained to him ” – instead of proposing an investigation of the scene of the crime and suggesting to the Polish authorities joint excava- tions for the determination of the size and position of the mass graves? With what small mental endowment the Düsseldorf judges were graced may be seen from the following passage of their verdict: 296 “The building, solidly constructed out of brick upon a concrete founda- tion, contained 3 gas chambers, whic h were approximately 4 × 4 m in area and about 2.6 m high. [...] Very soon after the inception of operations, the capacity of the old gas house proved to be insufficient for smoothly liquidating the daily arriving transports of Jews. For that reason, at the end of August/beginning of Sep- tember 1942, the construction of a new large gas house was started, which contained more and larger gas chambers and was able to be put in opera- tion after a construction period of about one month. [...] All are merely in agreement that the new gas chamb ers had a holding capacity approxi- mately double that of the chambers in the old building. The new gas cham- bers were probably about 8 m long, 4 m wide, and 2 m high. [p. 203f.] How many people respectively were contained in one gassing operation has not been determined with cert ainty in the main proceedings. [...] An accepted holding capacity of approx imately 200 to 350 people per gas chamber in the old house and approximately 400 to 700 people per gas chamber in the new house might safely be said to be most probable accord- ing to all [information] .” (p. 226) Therefore, according to this sterling jurist, up to 22 people per square me- ter could have been crammed into th e old as well as into the new gas cham- bers! As to the number of the German and Ukrainian guards, the verdict says: 488 “The camp staff in Treblinka, whic h was responsible for the smooth execution of the mass extermination, cons isted of about 35 to 40 Germans    487 In the same verdict we read that the cremation of the bodies began “ in the Spring of 1943 ” (p. 205). 488 Ibid ., pp. 206f."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Chapter V: Treblinka Trials 167 who all wore the field-gray uniforms of the Waffen-SS and all of whom had the rank of at least an SS-Unterscharführer. [...] Besides this group of German camp personnel there were about 90 to 120 Ukrainian volunteer auxiliaries, who mainly had to perform guard duties but besides that were also used to a certain exten t in the killing operations.” Confronting these – at most – 40 Germans and 120 Ukrainians, according to the Düsseldorf Court, there were up to 1,000 Jewish workers 489 and thou- sands of Jewish deportees with every arriving transport: “The accommodations of the Jewish workers, whose number was con- tinually changing, but which on average might be put at between 500 and 1,000, were very primitive. [...] ” These up to 1,000 Jewish workers not only had to experience how the Germans and Ukrainians were driving th eir co-religionists into the gas day af- ter day, but they themselves were always hovering on the brink of death: 490 “At their work, the Jews were driven to hurry by insults and blows from a whip. [...] For the least cause but often without any sort of reason, Jew- ish workers in both parts of the camp w ere reviled, abused, slain, or shot day after day. It sufficed that a Jew, according to the notion of his over- seer, was working too slowly or not carefully enough, so that he would be whipped half-dead and subsequently to be shot in the infirmary.” However, it never occurred to the Jewi sh workers (at least until August 2, 1943) of putting up a resistance against their tormentors and murderers, who were far inferior to them in numbers! The verdict has this to say concerni ng the measures taken to deceive the victims at their arrival: 491 “In order to strengthen the impression in those arriving that Treblinka was merely a transfer station for furt her transportation to the east for work, large signs in German and Polish were posted on the platform or in its direct vicinity, the gist of which read: ‘Attention Warsaw Jews! You are in a transit camp here, from which th ere will be further transport to work camps. [...] For purposes of bodily hygiene, all those arriving must bathe before further transport.’ In addition – at least in the first period of the mass killings – a member of the German camp staff often addressed the people assembled at the train station square and explained the same thing which was on the signs.” Exactly one page before quoting th e above passage from this verdict, Rückerl cites the Jewish witness “ Str. ” as follows: 492    489 Ibid ., p. 212. 490 Ibid ., p. 214. 491 Ibid ., p. 219. 492 Ibid ., p. 218."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 168 “I then remember the terrible c onfusion when the doors were flung open in Treblinka.

Then the people arriving also began to yell and com- plain. I still remember that we were st ruck with whips. Then we were told: ‘Men to the right, women to the left and undress.’” Naturally, under these circumstances a panic would have broken out im- mediately among the approximately 2,000 new arrivals 493 each time, and the 35 to 40 Germans as well as the 90 to 120 Ukrainians would not have been able to prevent their running off in ev ery direction. The measures of deception allegedly taken by the SS would have been entirely in vain there. And why did the 500 to 1,000 Jewish workers never warn their doomed co-religionists? No atrocity fairy tale from Jewish or Polish sources was too silly to be faithfully parroted by the Düsseldorf judges: 494 “During the first weeks after the camp had started operations, the or- chestra played lively operetta melodies near the hose in order to drown out the sound of the screams of the victims in the gas chambers.” Since in every normal murder trial an expert opinion must be compiled concerning the weapon used in the crime, and if no body is present, there must be clarity as to its whereabouts, an unbiased observer would perhaps assume that the West German justice administ ration would have consulted a diesel engine engineer and an expert on cremation in order to learn whether the mass gassings and mass cremations described by the witnesses were at all techni- cally feasible. But of all things, the Düsseldorf judges trotted out as an expert witness – a dog psychiatrist! From the original verdict of the first Treblinka trial: 495 “Either at the end of 1942 or the beginning of 1943, the dog Barry was brought into the extermination camp Treblinka. This was a black-and- white spotted mixed-breed dog as larg e as a calf with predominantly the characteristic traits of a St. Bernard. In the camp he associated himself with the defendant Franz and regarded him as his master. On his patrols through the upper and the lower camp, Franz was accus- tomed to having Barry with him most of the time.

In his persuasive expert report, Professor Dr. L. has stated, among other things, the following: From the photographs of Barry shown to him by the Jury Court, he notes that this was not a purebred St. Bernard but a mixed-breed dog, which clearly predominantly manifested the traits of a St. Bernard. Mixed- breed dogs are much more sensitive than purebred animals. If they have become attached to a master and have entered into a so-called dog-master bond, they would virtually foresee what intentions their master has; for a dog is ‘the reflection of the subconscious of its master,’ and that is espe- cially true of mixed-breed dogs. [...] After the convincing exposition of Professor Dr. L., there therefore exists no logical contradiction between the findings that Barry on the one hand was dangerous when he was in- cited to attack Jews by Franz, and that on the other hand, during the ab- sence of Franz, [...] he was indolent, good-tempered, and harmless on the camp property.” Adalbert Rückerl had this comment concerning these sagacious findings: 496 “The [....] statements give an impression of what effort and care the judges expended in resolving individual details of the crime.” Gegen Dummheit kämpfen selbst Götter vergebens.

The Demjanjuk Trial in Jerusalem On April 25, 1988, John (Ivan) Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian extradited two years earlier from the USA to Israel, was sentenced to death by hanging in Je- rusalem. The Court, consisting of the ju dges Dov Levin, Zvi A. Tal, and Dalia Dorner, had found him guilty of murder of several hundred thousand persons. He had been – so the verdict would ha ve it – that sadistic Ukrainian guard who had been called ‘Ivan the Terrible’ and who had operated the gas cham-   496 Ibid ., p. 234."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 170 bers of Treblinka. But this wasn’t enough: according to the Israeli judges, Demjanjuk had by no means been satisfi ed with gassing the Jews, but tortured many of his victims beforehand in an ou trageously bestial fashion. In its ver- dict, the Jerusalem court quoted the former Treblinka prisoner Pichas Epstein, who ‘recognized’ his former tormentor in Demjanjuk during the trial, as fol- lows: 497 “I saw this man of vast proportions, well built, solid, and he was oper- ating the motor, he was performing some action and pressing on something which activated the motor. After that, we would wait for twenty minutes to half an hour, and then they ordered th e doors to be opened, these were very wide doors, and the corpses to be taken out. Ivan would come out of this room and would rain murderous blows on us with the pipe. Sometimes he would come with a dagger, sometimes with a bayonet, and he would crack skulls, he would cut off ears, he would brutalize the prisoners, it is absolutely unbelievable, unbelievable, and he would stand next to the corpses and gaze upon them. I want to say, honorable court, that it was horrible to look at the corpses when th ey took them out of the cabins. Peo- ple with crushed faces, people with stab wounds, pregnant women with stab wounds in their bellies, women with the fetuses hanging half out, young girls with stab wounds on the breast, with eyes gouged out. [...] He would stand and gaze upon the results, what he had done, the stabbing of the girls, the gouging out of the eyes, th e severing of the girls’ breasts... he stood there like that, enjoying the scene... He was always near me, a few meters away. [...] And he would brutalize the prisoners, cut off a nose, in- jure somebody in the head, [...] Almost one million human beings, souls, were slaughtered, children, old people and little children. [...] Because they were Jews. This Ivan was a monster from another planet...” The testimony of the witness Eliyahu Rosenberg, who likewise had identi- fied Demjanjuk as the Satan of Treblinka, was recapitulated in the Jerusalem verdict as follows: 498 “I saw him especially when I wa s working on the ramp every day, whenever consignments of Jews arrived for extermination. I saw him when he stood next to the gas chambers at the entrance to the corridor with a de- structive instrument in his possession, such as a small short iron pipe, and a whip. He also wore a belt with his pi stol. This shouldn’t be so, all the de- structive instruments together...

Ivan only said to me (in Russian), I’ll give it to you. He gave it to me and he found the opportunity.” Another witness, Yehiel Reichmann, testified as follows, according to the Jerusalem verdict: 499 “I want to tell what took place next to the well with my friend Finkel- stein. While I was still washing teeth t ogether with him, with Finkelstein, this Ashmadai (devil) Ivan came with a drilling machine for drilling holes. And he rotated this drilling machine for making holes on Finkelstein’s but- tocks and said to him, if you scream I’ll shoot you... He injured that Finkelstein, he was bleeding and suffering great pain, intense pain, but he was not permitted to scream, because Ivan had given him an order – ‘If you scream, I’ll shoot you’... Ivan was a super-devil, a super destroyer from Treblinka.” Thus were the witness testimony during a trial, which from the very begin- ning was intended to once again, more than four decades after the end of the war, graphically conjure up the horror of the ‘Holocaust’ before the eyes of the world in general and of the Israeli populace in particular. The trial had originally been planned to be conducte d in a soccer stadium (!), but since its show-trial character would than have ap peared all too evident, this notion was abandoned and a movie theater was chosen as the courtroom. The Israeli me- dia relentlessly stoked the hysteria, and the trial was a mandatory topic in the nation’s schools. But then things went much differently from the way they were planned: The trial became a colossal fiasco for the State of Israel and its justice administration.

H. P. Rullmann, for- mer correspondent of the German left-wing news magazine Der Spiegel for Yugoslavia and Chairman of the German-Croatian Society, throws light not only upon the early history of the course up until then of the Demjanjuk trial (when the book appeared this trial was still underway), but also goes into the background features, in particular th e tension-laden relations between Jews and Ukrainians; several times the aut hor expresses doubts as to the correctness of the official version of Treblinka. On the other hand, the Israeli attorney Y. Sheftel, Demjanjuk‘s defense counsel, by his own admission an ardent Zion- ist, accepts this version without reser vation and insists merely upon the per- sonal innocence of his client, who has been the victim of a conspiracy. Thanks to the committed efforts of Sheftel, th e death sentence was quashed by the Is- raeli Appeals Court, and Demjanjuk was able to return to the USA after seven years of innocent imprisonment. In the following account of the Demjanjuk case, we are relying for the most part upon the documentation of Rullmann for events up to the beginning of 1987, which appeared in that year; for the period following that, we rely upon the Sheftel book. Ivan Demjanjuk, born in 1920 in the Ukraine, fell into German hands as a soldier of the Red Army in 1942. He was at first employed in the repair of railroad tracks and then came into the prisoner of war camp of Che ł m in east- ern Poland up to the beginning of 1944. In order to escape the hunger in the camp, he put himself at the disposal of the Germans as an auxiliary volunteer and was assigned to a Ukrainian Nati onal Guard unit under General Shandruk, which fought side by side with the Wehrmacht against the Soviets. In 1945, Demjanjuk escaped the fate of many of his countrymen, who were delivered up to the Bolsheviks by the British a nd were shipped into camps of the GU- Lag Archipelago. At first, he lived in Germany for a few years, married a Ukrainian woman there and emigrated to the US in 1952, where he made a life for himself as an auto worker and received citizenship in 1958. The fact that Demjanjuk was active in the Ukrainian community in his new residence of Cleveland, Ohio, spelled disaster for him. A certain Michael Ha- nusiak, staff member of the Communist newspaper Ukrainian News , pub- lished one article after another, in which the anti-Communist Ukrainian exiles supporting the independence of their homeland were calumniated as ‘Nazi collaborators,’ and he placed seventy su ch sinister figures as living in Cleve- land. In 1975, Demjanjuk came into the crosshairs of the Ukrainian News . Hanusiak claims that he had found the testimony of a certain Danilchenko in a Soviet archive, according to which the latter had gotten to know an Ivan Dem-   500 Yoram Sheftel, Defending “Ivan the Terrible.” The C onspiracy to convict John Demjanjuk , Regnery Publishing, Washington 1996."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Chapter V: Treblinka Trials 173 janjuk in Sobibór in March 1943. There – according to Danilchenko – that Demjanjuk had driven Jewish prisoners into the gas chambers as an execu- tioner’s assistant of the Germans; in the spring of the same year, he was alleg- edly sent, together with Danilchenko himself, to the Flossenbürg concentra- tion camp, where he again was employed as a guard. Now the battue against the autoworker could begin. The Cleveland news- paper Plain Dealer named him as ‘Ivan the Terrible,’ and starting in 1976, the U.S. immigration authorities looked to obtain information against him. They requested the Jewish World Congress to find former Sobibór inmates who could incriminate the suspect. There clearly were no such prosecution wit- nesses, and the mysterious Danilchenko himself had vanished without a trace. In a search for witnesses, a U.S. investig atory group traveled to Israel, where seven former Treblinka prisoners ‘reco gnized’ Demjanjuk as the evil Ivan of Treblinka on the basis of a photograph. These statements of course contra- dicted the information of Danilchenko, according to whom the Ukrainian had not been in Treblinka but in Sobibór and Flossenbürg, but the ball had finally been made to roll. Now the Moscow-directed Ukrainian News published an incriminating ‘document’ in facsimile, which once again was clearly not reconcilable with the testimony of the seven Israeli witn esses. It supposedly was a service ID card of Demjanjuk from the training camp Trawniki, where many Ukrainians had been trained as concentration camp guards during the war. According to this ID card, Demjanjuk had been de tailed to Sobibór on March 27, 1943; Treblinka was not mentioned on it. The document was an obvious and clumsy forgery, for it displayed neither a date of issuance nor an expiration date. (In mid-1987 it was subjected to a chemical an alysis by the McCrone Institute in the USA, which proved titanium oxide was a component of the photographic paper – a chemical used in black-and-white photography only since the end of the sixties. 501 ) The ‘original document’ was made available to the Israeli jus- tice administration by the Soviets just at the end of 1986, ten months after the extradition of Demjanjuk. Although to that point in time the US immigration authority could rely only upon a facsimile and the ID card, but had no proof for Demjanjuk’s pres- ence in Treblinka, the document was accepted as conclusive. Demjanjuk was deprived of his U.S. citizenship and under breach of constitutional principles was extradited to Israel in February 1986, a nation, which did not even exist at the time of the alleged mass murders in Treblinka. A substantial role in this scandalous violation of law had been played by the ‘Nazi-hunter authority’ OSI, established under President Jimmy Ca rter and for many years led by the Jew Neil Sher, which specialized – using perjured testimony and forged    501 Cf. also the analysis by Dieter Lehner, Du sollst nicht falsch Zeugnis geben , Berg without date [1988]."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 174 documents – in stripping innocent old men of German or eastern European de- scent of their U.S. citizenship and depo rting them or arranging their extradi- tion to prosecuting nations. 502 One year after this, the Jerusalem trial began, and five former Jewish Treb- linka prisoners, who claimed that they saw the accused in that camp in 1942/1943, recited their unspeakable tales of horror to the best of their ability. One embarrassing detail was obviously that one of these witnesses, Eliyahu Rosenberg, had stated the following in the year 1947 in Vienna: 503 “The second of August 1943 was set as the day of the revolt. [...] About three-thirty in the afternoon everything was prepared for the revolt. [...] Then one of the water-carriers right then dashed into the barracks and yelled: ‘Revolution in Berlin.’ This was the signal. Thereupon some people rushed into the barracks of the U krainian guard detachment, where among others also the Ukrainian Ivan was sl eeping, and killed the Ukrainians with shovels.” During the trial, however, Rosenberg ma de the excuse that he was only re- peating what he had heard and had not seen the death of Ivan himself. In April 1988, the Jerusalem Court pass ed the death sentence expected by all, but it was not carried out. Already by that time all too many embarrassing mishaps had occurred, and defense coun sel Sheftel (who had acid sprayed in his face by a criminal at the end of 1988, after a second attorney of Demjan- juk, Dov Eitan, had been thrown from a high-rise a few days before and had passed away during this tragic accident) thoroughly exploited these mishaps in his appeal. Lastly, Sheftel pointed to an Ivan Marchenko – missing without a trace – as the actual Ivan the Terrible. This name was at first put forward by a former prostitute living in the ham- let of Treblinka, who had numbered am ong her clientele several Ukrainian guards from the camp of the same name during the war, among them also the aforesaid Ivan Marchenko, but Sheftel found shortly thereafter still further ‘evidence’ in the USSR. According to S oviet court documents, a Ukrainian by the name of Nikolai Shelaiev, who had been condemned to death and shot in 1952 due to alleged crimes in Treblinka , had identified this Ivan Marchenko as operator of the gas chambers of Treblinka. Shelaiev‘s testimony had been confirmed by several other former Trebli nka guards, and a personal ID card of Marchenko from Trawniki also came to light.    502 By means of the example of one case (the prosecution of Martin Bartesch), Andrew Allen documents the murky machinations of the OSI in “ Die US-Nazijäger vom OSI und der Holocaust-Mythos ”, Vierteljahreshefte für freie Geschichtsforschung , 5(4) (2001), pp. 428- 430; English online: “ The Office of Special Investigations and the Holocaust Myth, ” www.codoh.com/trials/triosi.html. 503 This explanation of Rosenberg has been reproduced in full by H.

Bu t there were no witnesses for such crimes, and according to the Israeli- American extradition treaty Demjanjuk was not permitted to be brought to account for any kind of actions in these two camps, since his extradition had been pred icated solely on his alleged atroci- ties in Treblinka. Thus he was finally able to return to the USA in September of 1993. Up to the present day, this innocent man had not received a single dollar of compensation for the shameful injustice done to him.

All else is pure fantasy. The Demjanjuk trial, in which all five Jewish ‘eyewitnesses’ proved to be perjured liars and swindlers, dealt a frightful blow to the credibility of such witnesses.

Emigration Since Adolf Hitler‘s assumption of po wer, the National-Socialist policy toward the Jews was consistently that of pursuing their ‘removal’ from Ger- many. 505 On August 28, 1933, the Ministry of Economics of the Reich concluded the so-called ‘Haavara Agreement’ with the Jewish Agency for Palestine, an eco- nomic agreement that was supposed to form the foundation for the emigration of approximately 52,000 German Jews to Palestine up to the year 1942. 506 Up until the outbreak of the Second World War and indeed even after its start – as long as circumstances permitted it – the emigration of Jews into all nations prepared to accept them was the leitmotif of the National-Socialist policy. This is confirmed by a report of the Foreign Ministry of January 25, 1939, which bore the title: “ Die Judenfrage als Faktor der Außenpolitik im Jahre 1938 ” (The Jewish question as a factor of foreign policy in 1938): 507 “The final goal of German policy regarding the Jews is the emigration of all Jews living in the territory of the Reich.” On the previous day, the 25th of January 1939, Hermann Göring had is- sued a decree, which approved the establishment of a ‘Reich Central Office for Jewish Emigration.’ Reinhard Heydrich was put in charge of it. In the first line, Göring summarized the basic principle of the NS policy vis-a-vis the Jews: “The emigration of the Jews out of Germany is to be promoted by all means.”    505 Hitler was already expressing himself as being of this mind in the first written document of his political career, a letter to his friend Ge mlich on September 16, 1919 (a), and later in his speech “ Warum sind wir Antisemiten? ” (b). a) E.

In the period that fol- lowed we have managed, despite great difficulties and even during the war, in successfully continuing the Jewish emigration. Since taking on the task through my administrative office on January 1, 1939, up to now more than 200,000 Jews have emigrated out of the terri- tory of the Reich. The whole problem – there are already approximately 3¼ million Jews in the territories today subjected to German sovereignty – can, however, no longer be solved by emigration . A territorial final solution thus is becoming necessary.” As a result of this letter, the Forei gn Ministry devised the so-called Mada- gascar Plan. On July 3, 1940, Franz Ra demacher, Director of the Jewish De- partment in the Foreign Ministry, composed a report entitled “ Die Judenfrage im Friedensvertrage ” (The Jewish Question in the Peace Treaty), which be- gins with the following declaration: “The approaching victory gives Germany the possibility and, in my opinion, the duty as well of solving the Jewish problem in Europe. The most desirable solution of all is: all Jews out of Europe.” Rademacher explained that with the peace treaty – regarded as imminent – with France, the latter would give up the island of Madagascar as a mandate territory, to which all European Jew s would be deported and which would form an autonomous state under the control of Germany: 510 “The island will be transferred to Germany as a mandate. [...] Other than that, the Jews obtain self-government in this territory: their own may- ors, their own police, their own post office and rail administration etc. The Jews will be liable as co-debtors for the value of the whole island.” The project was approved by Ribbentrop and was referred to the Reichssi- cherheitshauptamt , which was supposed to be re sponsible for the technical    508 NG-2586-A. 509 T-173. 510 NG-2586-B."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Chapter VI: National-Socialist Policy of Jewish Emigration 181 preparations for the resettlement of th e Jews onto the east African island and the supervision of the evacuated Jews. 511 It was just this, which was the “ territorial final solution ” of the Jewish question, which Heydrich had in mind. 2. The Madagascar Plan 512 On August 30, 1940, Rademacher prepared the note “ Madagaskar-Pro- jekt ,” in which the section “ Finanzierung ” (Financing) begins with the follow- ing words: 513 “The execution of the proposed final solution requires substantial means.” The ‘final solution of the Jewish question’ therefore meant nothing other than the resettlement of the European Jews to Madagascar. On July 12, 1940, Hans Frank, Governor General of Pola nd, gave a speech, in which he made known the decision 514 “to deport the whole kindred of Jewry in the German Reich, in the Gen- eral Gouvernement, and in the Protector ate within the shortest time imag- inable after the conclusion of peace to an African or American colony. Madagascar is being considered, which is supposed to be ceded by France for this purpose.” On July 25, Frank repeated that the Führer had decided to deport the Jews, 515 “as soon as the overseas traffic perm its the possibility of the transpor- tation of the Jews.” In October 1940, Alfred Rosenberg wrote an article entitled “ Juden auf Madagaskar ” (Jews on Madagascar), in which he recalled that already at the anti-Jewish Congress of Budapest in 1927 “ [...] the question of a future forced evacuation of the Jews out of Europe [was] discussed, and the proposal surfa ced for the first time here of promoting Madagascar as the future home of the Jews.” Rosenberg took up the proposal and expressed his wish that “ Jewish high- finance ” of the USA and Great Britain might also contribute to the establish-   511 NG-2586-J. 512 A detailed complete study of this question is Magnus Brechtken‘s “Madagaskar für die Ju- den”: Antisemitische Idee und politische Praxis 1895-1945 , R.

Parallel to this, the au- thorities of the Reich kept promoting the Jewish emigration mainly out of Germany by all means. On May 20, 1941, in expectation of the execution of the Madagascar Plan, which, so it was thought, was imminent , Heydrich prohibited Jewish emigra- tion from France and Belgium “ in view of the undoubted approaching final solution of the Jewish problem .” 520 But Heydrich nevertheless repeated the central principle of the NS policy toward the Jews: 521 “In conformity with a communicati on from the Reichsmarschall of the Greater German Reich [Göring] , the emigration of the Jews from the terri- tory of the Reich, including the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, is to be carried out and even intensified during the war within the limits of the existing possibilities with attention to the guidelines set up for the emigra- tion of the Jews.” Heydrich then unambiguously explained the reasons for the prohibition of Jewish emigration from France and Belgium: 520 “Since there exist, for example, only in sufficient travel possibilities for the Jews out of the Reich territory, chiefly across Spain and Portugal, an emigration of Jews from France and Belgium would mean a renewed de- crease of the same.” Two months after that, on July 31, Göring entrusted Heydrich with the mission to effect all necessary preparations for the ‘final solution,’ i.e. the    516 CDJC, CXLVI-51, pp. 4, 7, 9. 517 CDJC, CXLVI-23, pp. 6 and 82. 518 IMT , Vol. XVII, pp. 250. 519 IMT , Vol. X, p. 398. 520 NG-3104. 521 NG-2586-E.

Precisely because it included all Jews of the occupied Eur opean nations, this solution was de- scribed as the “ Gesamt lösung ” (complete solution). By virtue of the fact that Heydrich wrote on November 6, 1941, that he had already been charged for years with the preparation for the ‘final solution’ in Europe, 524 he himself was clearly referring to the task assigned to him by the order of January 14, 1939, and identif ied the ‘final solution’ with the “ solution in form of an emigration or evacuation ,” which Göring had specified as the goal in the letter of July 31, 1941. In th e same context belongs an order, which was transmitted to the Foreign Office by Adolf Eichmann on August 28, 1941, and which prohibited “ an emigration of Jews out of the territories occupied by us, in consideration of the final solution of the issue of European Jews, which is in preparation and is approaching .” 525 3.

In place of the ‘final solution’ by forced resettlement to Madagascar, a ‘territorial final solution’ emerged by means of deporting the European Jews into the eastern territories conquered by the Germans. This change of course was announced on August 22, 1941, by SS- Sturmbannführer Carltheo Zeitschel, an advisor at the German embassy in Paris, who wrote a note to the attention of ambassador Otto Abetz: 526 “The progressive conquest and occupation of the far eastern territories can presently bring the Jewish problem in all of Europe to a final satisfac- tory solution within a very short time. As is seen from the cries for assis- tance by all the Jews of Palestine in their press to the American Jews, over 6 million Jews reside in the territori es occupied by us during the last weeks, especially Bessarabia, which means one-third of World Jewry. Dur- ing the new arranging of the eastern lands, these 6 million Jews would have to be collected anyhow and a sp ecial territory presumably marked off for them. It shouldn’t be too big a pr oblem, at this opportunity, if the Jews from all the other European countries are added to this and the Jews pres- ently crammed into ghettos in Warsaw, Litzmannstadt, Lublin, etc. are also deported there. As far as the occupied territories are concerned, such as Holland, Bel- gium, Luxemburg, Norway, Yugoslavia, Greece, the Jews can simply be transported by military order in mass-tr ansports into the new territory, and it can be suggested to the rest of the states that they follo w the example and get rid of their Jews by sending them to this territory. We could then have Europe free of Jews within a very short time. The idea, which has recurred for yea rs and which was once again aired a few months ago by Admiral Darlan, of transporting all the Jews of Europe to Madagascar, is, to be sure, not bad in itself, but would run up against insurmountable transportation difficulties directly after the war, since world tonnage, seriously decimated by the war, will surely be needed for other things more important than taking large numbers of Jews for a ride on the oceans of the world. Not to mention that transportation of nearly 10 million would require years, even if there were plentiful ships available. For this reason, I propose to present this question at the next opportu- nity to the Reich Foreign Ministry and to ask to meet for discussion with the already named future Minister for the eastern territories, Reichsleiter Rosenberg, and with the Reichsführer-SS with such a regulation in mind and to examine the matter according to the idea I have proposed. The problem of transportation of the Jews into the eastern territories could be dealt with even during the war and would not encounter insurmountable    526 PS-1017."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Chapter VI: National-Socialist Policy of Jewish Emigration 185 difficulties after the war, especially si nce all the Jews in the General Gou- vernement would be able to cover the di stance into the new delineated ter- ritory, of course, with their automobiles on country roads.” After Zeitschel had alluded to the situ ation of French Jewry, he concluded: “Furthermore, I would propose to sugg est this idea at the next oppor- tunity also to the Reichsmarschall, who is currently quite receptive to the Jewish problem and who for his part, in his present engagement and ac- cording to his experiences, could su rely be an extraordinarily strong sup- porter in the execution of the idea developed above.” The plan of deporting the Jews into the eastern territories had already been considered earlier several times. On Apr il 2, 1941, even before the start of the eastern campaign, Reichsminister Ro senberg had toyed with the thought 527 “of making use to a greater extent of Muscovite Russia as a disposal region for undesirable elements of the population.” On July 17, 1941, General Governor Frank made the following entry in his work diary: 528 “The Herr Governor General wants no further ghetto-formation, since according to an expressive declaration of the Führer of June 19 of this year, the Jews would be removed from the General Gouvernement within a foreseeable time, and the General Gouvernement is supposed to be only a sort of transit camp.” On August 20, 1941, after a visit to the headquarters of the Führer , Goeb- bels confided the following to his diary: 529 “Beyond this, however, the Führer has promised me that I can deport the Jews out of Berlin into the east directly after the end of the eastern campaign. [...] ” On September 24, 1941, Goebbels had a conversation with Heydrich in the Führer ’s headquarters; on the day after, he wrote in his diary that the Jews in the east “in the end are all supposed to be transported [...] into the camps built by the Bolsheviks.” 529 Likewise, on September 28, he wrote that the Führer held the view that one must push the Jews step by step out of all of Germany, and he expressed the following desire: 529 “Berlin is first in line, and it is my hope that we succeed already during the course of this year in transporting a substantial part of the Berlin Jews to the east.”    527 Citation by Martin Broszat, “ Hitler und die Genesis der “Endl ösung.” Aus Anlaß der Thesen von David Irving ,”, in: Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte , no. 25/4, 1977, pp. 748f. 528 Ibid ., p. 750. 529 Ibid ., p. 751."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 186 In a note of October 7, 1941, Werner Koeppen, a liaison to Rosenberg, wrote that Hitler had declared the following on the previous day with respect to the Protectorate: 529 “All Jews must be removed from the Protectorate, and indeed not just into the General Gouvernement, but dir ectly farther to th e east. The great requirements for means of transportation are the only reason why this cannot be executed at the moment. Along with the Protectorate Jews, all Jews should disappear from Berlin and Vienna at the same time.” On October 13, 1941, Frank and Ro senberg had a conversation, during which they also discussed the deporta tion of the Jews from the General Gou- vernement: 530 “The Governor General than came to speak about the possibility to de- port the Jewish population of the Gen eral Gouvernement into the occupied territories of the east. Reichsminist er Rosenberg remarked that similar re- quests were already being brought to him from the military administration in Paris. [531] At the moment, however, he saw no possibility as yet for the carrying out of these kind of resettlement plans. But he announced himself ready to promote the emigration of Jews to the east in the future, especially since the intention existed anyhow of sending off asocial elements within the territory of the Reich into the spar sely settled territories of the east.” Zeitschel‘s proposal was thus accepted some months later by Hitler him- self, who resolved to temporarily shelve the Madagascar Plan and to deport all Jews living in the occupied territori es to the east. This decision of the Führer was probably made in September 1941. On October 23, 1941, Himmler pro- hibited Jewish emigration, effective at once, 532 and on the following day the evacuation of 50,000 western Jews to the east was ordered. On October 24, Kurt Daluege, Chief of the Ordnungspolizei (regular police force responsible for keeping public order), issued a decree that dealt with “ Evacuations of Jews from the Old Reich and the Protectorate ”: 533 “In the period from November 1 to December 4, 1941, 50,000 Jews will be deported by the Sicherheitspolizei [Security Police] from the Old Reich, the Ostmark [Austria] and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to the east, into the region around Riga and Minsk. The evacuations will take place in transport trains of the Reichsbahn [German railway] for 1,000 persons at a time.

Food for the winter could be secured in scanty amounts. [...] As soon as the technical possibility ex ists within the scope of the total solution of the Jewish question, the Jews will be deported by sea to the re- ception camps in the east.” If, according to this, a portion of these Serbian Jews (the adult males) were shot and the rest were subject to the “ total solution to the Jewish problem ,” it is clear that the physical destruction of the Jews could not have been meant by the latter, but merely the deportation into “ reception camps in the east ,” which served to accept Jews incapable of working. The new course of the NS policy toward the Jews was officially announced to the senior party ranks at the Wannsee Conference, called expressly for this purpose. The Conference, originally planned for December 9, 1941, 536 but then postponed, took place on January 20, 1942, at Großer Wannsee 56/58 in Berlin. The speaker was Reinhard Heydrich. The Conference protocol begins with a broad retrospective on the Natio nal-Socialist Jewish policy up to that point: 537 “At the beginning of the discussion Chief of the Security Police and of the SD [Sicherheitsdienst = Security Service] , SS-Obergruppenführer Hey- drich, reported that the Reich Mars hal had appointed him delegate for the preparations for the final solution of the Jewish question in Europe and pointed out that this discussion had been called for the purpose of clarify- ing fundamental questions.

The Reichsführer-SS and the Chief of the German Police (Chief of the Security Police and the SD) was entrusted with the official central handling of the final solution of the Jewish question without regard to geographic borders. The Chief of the Security Police and the SD then gave a short report of the struggle which has been carried on thus far against this enemy, the es- sential points being the following: a/ the expulsion of the Jews from every sphere of life of the German people, b/ the expulsion of the Jews from the living space of the German people. In carrying out these efforts, an in creased and planned acceleration of the emigration of the Jews from Reich territory was started, as the only possible present solution. By order of the Reich Marshal, a Reich Central Office for Jewish Emi- gration was set up in January 1939 and the Chief of the Security Police and SD was entrusted with the manageme nt. Its most important tasks were: a/ to make all necessary arrange ments for the preparation for an in- creased emigration of the Jews, b/ to direct the flow of emigration, c/ to speed the procedure of emigration in each individual case . The aim of all this was to cleanse German living space of Jews in a le- gal manner.” Heydrich emphasized that as a result of this policy and despite various dif- ficulties, up to October 31, 1941, appr oximately 537,000 Jews had emigrated: – approximately 360,000 from the Old Reich , borders of January 30, 1933. – approximately 147,000 from the Ostm ark, borders of March 15, 1938. – approximately 30,000 from the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, borders of March 15, 1939. The protocol continues: “In the meantime the Reichsführer-SS and Chief of the German Police had prohibited emigration of Jews due to the dangers of an emigration in wartime and due to the possibilities of the east. Another possible solution of the pr oblem has now taken the place of emigration, i.e. the evacuation of the Jews to the East, provided that the Führer gives the appropriate approval in advance. These actions are, however, only to be considered provisional, but practical experience is already being collected, which is of the greatest importance in relation to the future final solution of the Jewish question.” Thus, on Hitler‘s order, the deportation of Jews into the occupied territories of the east replaced the emigration or expulsion of all European Jews to"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Chapter VI: National-Socialist Policy of Jewish Emigration 189 Madagascar, though merely as a “ provisional ” solution pending a ‘final solu- tion’ of this issue after the war’s end. Already in August 1940, Hitler had announced his intention to evacuate all Jews of Europe after the war. 538 According to a note of the Reich Chancellery from March or April 1942, he had repeat edly informed Lammers, the chief of this Chancellery, “ that he wanted to defer the solution of the Jewish problem until after the war. ” 539 On July 24, 1942, the Führer confirmed this intention with pithy words: 540 “After finishing the war he will take the rigorous position that he will crush city after city, if the Jews would not come out and migrate to Mada- gascar or some other Jewish national state.” The intention of the National-Socialists to deal with the solution of the Jewish problem after the war is also apparent from the so-called ‘Brown Port- folio,’ which was devised by Rosenberg on June 20, 1941, and integrated into the ‘Green Portfolio’ of September 1942. There, the section “ Richtlinien für die Behandlung der Judenfrage ” (Guidelines for the handling of the Jewish question) begins with the following words: 541 “All measures for the Jewish problem in the occupied eastern territo- ries must be executed with the perspective that the Jewish problem will be solved for all of Europe in general after the war. For this reason they are to be applied as preparatory partial measures and must be in harmony with the decisions otherwise affecti ng this area. On the other hand, the ex- periences gained in the handling of the Jewish question in the occupied eastern territories can point the way to the solution of the whole problem, since the Jews in these regions, together with the Jews of the General Gou- vernement, comprise the strongest c ontingent of European Jewry. Meas- ures, which are of a purely harassing na ture, are to be refrained from un- der any circumstances as being unworthy of a German.” In a copy of these “ Guidelines for the handling of the Jewish Problem ,” which however bears no date but which ne vertheless certainly comes from this period of time, an additional sentence w as inserted after the sentence ending with “ decisions otherwise affecting this area ”: 542 “This applies with particular urgency for the creation of at least tempo- rary possibilities for the reception of Jews from the Reich territory.”    538 Memorandum of Luther for Rade macher of August 15, 1940, in: Documents on German Foreign Policy 1918-1945 , Her Majesty’s Stationery Offi ce, Series D, Volume X, London 1957, p. 484. 539 PS-4025. 540 Henry Picker, Hitler’s Tischgespräche im Führerhauptquartier , Wilhelm Goldmann Verlag, Munich 1981, p. 456. 541 “ Richtlinien für die Führung der Wirtsc haft in den besetzten Ostgebieten ” (Grüne Mappe), Berlin, September 1942.

The Madagascar Plan was officially abandoned on February 10, 1942. A letter from Rademacher to the envoy Bielfeld of the Foreign Ministry, dated Febru- ary 10, 1942, explains the reasons: 544 “In August 1940, I passed on to you for your files the plan devised by my department for the final solution of the Jewish question, for which the island of Madagascar was supposed to be demanded from France in the peace treaty, but the practical executio n of the task was supposed to be handed over to the Reichssicherheitshaupt amt. In accordance with this plan, Gruppenführer Heydrich was put in charge by the Führer of carrying out the solution to the Jewish problem in Europe. In the meantime, the war against the Soviet Union has provided the possibility of making other territories available for the final solution. The Führer has consequently decided that the Jews will not be deported to Madagascar, but to the east instead. Thus, Madagascar no longer needs to be designated for the final solution.” The ‘final solution’ was therefore of a territorial nature and consisted of the deportation of the Jews out of the territories governed by Germany to the east. This is fully consistent with anothe r important document, the Luther Memo- randum of August 1942. In it Luther mainly summarized all essential points of the NS policy with respect to the Jews: 545 “The principle of the German Jewish po licy after the war, after the as- sumption of power, consisted of pr omoting Jewish emigration by every means. For this purpose a Reich Central Office for Jewish Emigration was created in the year 1939 by General Field Marshall Göring in his capacity as delegate for the four-year plan, and the administration was handed over to Gruppenführer Heydrich as Ch ief of the Security Police.” After he had explained the genesis and development of the Madagascar Plan, which in the meantime had been ove rtaken by events, Luther stressed that Göring’s letter of July 31, 1941, was the result of the Heydrich letter of June 24, 1940, according to which th e Jewish question was no longer to be    543 PA, Politische Abteilung III 245, AZ Po 36, Bd.

[...] On the basis of this directive, Gruppenführer Heydrich arranged a meeting on January 20, 1942, of all participating German ad- ministrative departments, which the secretaries of state of the remaining ministries and I myself, from the Foreign Office, had attended. At the meet- ing, Gruppenführer Heydrich explained that the Reichsmarschall had or- dered him by the directive of the Führer, and that the Führer had now ap- proved the evacuation of the Jews to the east instead of the emigration.” On the basis of this order, Luther added, the evacuation of the Jews from Germany had been implemented. Their d estination was the eastern territories, to which they would be deported via the General Gouvernement: “The transportation to the Genera l Gouvernement is a temporary measure. The Jews will be transported on ward to the eastern territories as soon as the technical prerequisites for this are in place.” A circular of October 9, 1942, entitled “ Rumors concerning the situation of the Jews in the east ,” intended for party functionaries, explains the measures taken against the Jews as follows: 546 “In the course of the work on the final solution of the Jewish question, discussions concerning ‘very harsh meas ures’ taken against the Jews, par- ticularly in the eastern territories, are currently arising amongst the popu- lation in various parts of the Reich t erritory. It has been determined that such accounts – mostly in distorted and exaggerated form – are being passed on by those on leave from variou s units employed in the east, who themselves have had occasion to observe such measures. It is conceivable that not all fellow-countrymen are able to muster ade- quate understanding for the necessity of such measures, especially not the part of the populace, which have no opportunity to form their own opinion of the Bolshevist atrocity. In order to be able to counter any creation of rumors in this connection, which frequently bears an intentionally tendentious character, the exposi- tion set out below is given for instruction about the present situation: For approximately 2,000 years, a struggle has been fought against Jewry, which has been in vain so far. Only since 1933 have we started to seek ways and means, which permit a complete separation of Jewry from the body of the German people.

Expulsion of the Jews from various areas of life of the German peo- ple. Here, the laws enacted by the legislator should form the foundation, which affords the guarantee of also protecting future generations from a possible new flooding by the enemy. 2. The aim of completely expelling the enemy from the territory of the Reich. Considering the tightly restricted living-space available to the Ger- man people, it was hoped that this problem would be essentially solved through acceleration of emigration of the Jews. Since the beginning of the war in 1939, these possibilities for emigra- tion became increasingly reduced; on the other hand, the economic domain of the German people steadily increa sed in comparison with its living- space, so that today, considering the large number of the Jews residing in these territories, a complete expulsion by means of emigration is no longer possible. Since already our next generation will no longer see this problem as realistically and, on the basis of past experiences, will no longer see it clearly enough, and because the matt er, once it has started rolling, makes a settlement urgent, the whole problem must be solved by the present gen- eration. For that reason, the complete expulsion or separation of the millions of Jews residing in the European economic domain is a compelling com- mandment in the struggle to secure the existence of the German people. Beginning with the territory of the Reich and leading to the rest of the European nations included in the final solution, the Jews will be continu- ously transported to the east into larg e camps, some existing, some still to be constructed, from whence they will ei ther be put to work or be taken still farther to the east. The old Jews, as well as the Jews with high war decora- tions (E.K.I., Golden Medal for Bravery etc.) will continue to be resettled in the city of Theresienstadt located in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. It lies in the nature of things that these in part very difficult problems can be solved only with ruthless severi ty in the interests of the ultimate se- curity of our people.” In a report entitled “ Financing the Measures for the Solution of the Jewish Problem ” from December 14, 1942, Ministerial Counselor Maedel summed up the National-Socialist policy toward the Jews as follows: 547 “The Reichsmarschall charged the Reichsführer-SS and Chief of the German Police a long time ago with p reparing the measures, which will serve the final solution of the European Jewish question. The Reichsführer- SS has entrusted the execution of the tasks to the Chief of the Security Po- lice and of the SD.

More- over, in more recent times old peoples’ homes (old peoples’ ghettos) have been established within Reich territory for the admission of Jews, e.g. in Theresienstadt. Indications as to the particulars are found in the note of August 21, 1942. The establishment of additional old peoples’ homes in the eastern territories is imminent.” 4. Results of the NS Policy of Promoting Jewish Emigration The National-Socialist policy for the promotion of Jewish emigration con- formed to a concrete goal of the Reich leadership and was accordingly con- ducted earnestly and successfully. In April of 1943, Richard Korherr, Inspec- tor for Statistics at the office of the Reichsführer of the SS, wrote a report enti- tled “ The Final Solution to the European Jewish Question ,” 548 in which the following figures are given: Region Start of Period ending Dec. 31, 1942 Emigration Mortality Surplus Altreich (Germany proper, with Sudetenland) January 31, 1933 (Sept. 29, 1938) –382,534 –61,193 Ostmark (Austria) Marc h 13, 1938 –149,124 –14,509 Bohemia and Moravi March 16, 1939 –25,699 –7,074 Eastern Territories (with Bia ł ystok) September 1939 (June 1940) –334,673 General Gouvernement (Po- land, with Lemberg) September 1939 (June 1940) –427,920 Combined Total –1,402,726 Thus, 557,357 Jews emigrated from the Altreich (Germany proper), Aus- tria, and Bohemia and Moravia, to which more than half of the 762,593 Jews from the General Gouvernement and the eastern territories can be added, 549 a figure from the categories “ Emigration ” and “ Mortality Surplus ” combined by Korherr for those two areas.

The Start of Deportation of Jews to the East The policy of deportation of Jews to the east, which was decided upon by Hitler himself in September 1941, received its official blessing in a letter, which Himmler wrote to Gauleiter Arthur Greiser on September 18, 1941: 550 “The Führer desires that the Altreich [Germany proper] and the Protec- torate be emptied and freed of Jews as soon as possible, from the west to the east. It is therefore my intention, if possible already this year, to ini- tially transport the Jews from the Altreich and the Protectorate into the eastern territories newly incorporated into the Reich two years ago, as a first stage, in order to deport them still farther to the east next spring. I am planning to bring about 60,000 Jews of the Altreich and the Pro- tectorate into the Litzmannstadt Ghe tto for the winter, which, as I under- stand, has space to accept them. In the interests of the Reich as a whole, I am asking you not only to understand, but to exert all your powers in sup- porting this measure, which surely will cause difficulties for your district. SS-Gruppenführer Heydrich, who has the task of carrying out this mi- gration of Jews, will be turning to y ou in due course, directly or through SS-Gruppenführer Koppe.” At a meeting held in Prague on October 10, 1941, in which Heydrich also took part, the solution of the Jewish problem in the Protectorate as well as the partial solution of the Jewish problem in the Altreich was discussed. The start of the deportations was fixed for Oc tober 15, and the deportation of 50,000 Jews to Minsk and Riga was decided upon: 551 “It was planned to begin with it on October 15, 1941, in order to get the transports started gradually un til November 15, up to an amount of about 5,000 Jews – from Prague only. For the time being, much considera- tion must still be shown to the Litzm annstadt authorities. Minsk and Riga are supposed to get 50,000.” In regard to the accommodation of the future deportees, we read: “SS-Brif. [Brigadeführer] Nebe and Rash can take Jews into the camps for Communist prisoners in the zone of operations.” As already mentioned, the deportation order was issued on October 24, 1941. The eastern territories were the destination of these deportations. At that time, the eastern territories under civilian administration were the Reichs- kommissariat Ostland and the Reichskommissariat Ukraine , both subject to the authority of Alfred Rosenberg, the Re ichsminister for the occupied territo- ries of the east.

The first orders with respect to the Jews in the eastern territories were harsh, but in no way aimed at an extermination. The paragraph “ Guidelines for the handling of the Jewish question ” in the ‘Brown Portfolio’ dating from June 20, 1941, intended the isolation of the local Jews from the rest of the population and their exclusion from economic, social, and cultural life by means of ghettoization: 552 “Freedom of movement is immediately abolished for all Jews. A trans- fer to ghettos is aimed at, which is facilitated in White Russia and in the Ukraine by the presence of numerous more or less closed Jewish settle- ments. A Jewish self-government with Jewish police can be given to these ghettos under supervision.” The “Temporary guidelines for the treatmen t of the Jews in the territory of the Reichskommissariat Ostland ”, which were presented to Rosenberg on Au- gust 13, 1941, also planned strict measures for the exclusion of Jews from public life and their concentration in ghettos: 553 “The Jews are to be concentrated as far as is practicable in cities or sections of cities, which already ha ve a predominantly Jewish populace. Ghettos are to be established there. The Jews are to be prohibited from leaving the ghettos. In the ghettos, they are to be allowed to have as much food as the rest of the populace can do without, but not more than neces- sary for a scanty nutrition of the occ upants. The same applies to supplying them with essential goods.” After a reference to the self-government in the ghettos, the “ Guidelines ” deal with deployment of the Jews for labor: “The Jews who are capable of working are to be conscripted for forced labor according to the need for labor . The economic interests of residents, who are worthy of advancement, are not to be permitted to be injured by the Jewish forced labor. The forced labo r can be performed in work parties outside of the ghettos, inside the ghetto, or, where ghettos have not yet been established, also individually outside of the ghettos (e.g. in the work- shop of the Jews).” These orders went into effect in the ge neral district of Latvia on September 1, 1941. 554    552 “ Richtlinien für die Führung der Wirtsc haft in den neubesetzten Ostgebieten ” (Grüne Map- pe), Berlin, September 1942.

The employment of Jews was permitted exclusively “ in specially collected labor crews ” under German supervision. On October 1, 1941, SS- Sturmbannführer Ehrlinger, with permission of his superior Franz Stahlecker, Head of Einsatzgruppe A, composed a note on the subject “ Establishment of a Concentration Camp in Latvia .” It proposed the formation of a camp in the vicinity of Riga for approximately 3,000 prisoners sitting in jails and for approximately 23,000 Jews living in the ghetto of Riga. The prisoners were supposed to be empl oyed at the cutting of peat and the production of tiles. As to the Jews, it said: 556 “Already now it can be said that th e intended space offers many possi- bilities of the sort, which can enable all Jews remaining in Riga and in Lat- via in general to be collected there. In doing so, the Jews must be sepa- rated from the Jewesses from the start, in order to prevent further repro- duction. Children under 14 years of age must remain with the women.” The proposal was approved by Reichsminister Rosenberg. On December 4, 1941, he wrote a letter to Reichskommissar Lohse on the subject of “ Solution of the Jewish Question ,” in which he reported the following: 557 “The suggestions of Herr Generalkommi ssar in Riga with regard to the transportation of Jews from the Altreich to Riga and the establishment of Jewish camps have been passed on to me. As SS-Obergruppenführer Hey- drich reported at a meeting a few days ago, the Jewish camp whose con- struction was planned at Riga is supposed to go into the Plaskau region.” 6. Direct Transports of Jews to the Eastern Territories The deportation of 50,000 Jews from the Protectorate and the Altreich to Minsk and Riga, decided upon during the meeting of October 10, 1941, began a month later. However, it represented only the first step of the deportations, since the deportees were supposed to be taken even farther east.

Arrival of the 1st transport at Minsk, November 10, in Riga November 19. Urgently request to prevent transports, since Jewish camps must be shifted consider ably farther to the east.” On the same day, Dr. Leibbrand, head of the office at the Rosenberg Min- istry, sent the following telegram to Lohse: 559 “Regarding transports of Jews into the Ostland. Precise message on its way. Jews are coming farther east. Camps in Riga and Minsk only temporary measures, no objections on that account here.” The local authorities were anything but delighted about the influx of these western Jews and lodged protests against it several times. On November 20, 1941, the Wehrmacht commander of the Ostland wrote a letter to Lohse on the subject “ Transportation of Jews from Germany to White Russia ,” in which he explained: 560 “According to a report of the 707th Division, 25,000 Jews are supposed to be transported out of Germany to White Russia, of which 3,000 are al- legedly intended for Minsk and 1,500 ha ve already arrived from Hamburg. The immigration of German Jews, who are far superior in intelligence to the masses of the White Russian popula tion, means a great danger to the appeasement of White Russia.” The Jewish population of White Russia, the letter continued, was “ Bolshe- vist and capable of every attitude hostile to Germany ” as well as active in the resistance. Therefore, the German-Jewish new arrivals would get into contact with Communist organizations. For this reason as well as because the deporta- tions would hinder the transports for the Wehrmacht, the Wehrmacht com- mander asked that “arrangements be made that no Jews come from Germany to White Russia.” But the protests faded away unheard. On November 20, 1941, Stahlecker reported to Lohse: 561 “The transports of Jews are at present arriving in Minsk as planned.

He wrote the latter a letter on the subject “ Evacuation of Jews from Germany to Minsk ,” in which he explained that he had heard that the central authorities had the in- tention “of bringing approximately 50,000 more Jews from Germany to Minsk in the next weeks and months.” About 100,000 civilians lived in that city, which literally lay in ruins, and also “ about 7,000 Jews from Germany ” as well as “ roughly from 15,000 to 18,000 Russian Jews ” as prisoners. Thus, no possibility existed of accommo- dating any more people. To these difficulties, “ the very serious problem of feeding the population (including the Jews) ” was added. For these reasons, Janetzke asked for the cessation of the Jewish transports to Minsk. 564 County Court official Wetzel responded on behalf of Rosenberg in a letter dated January 16, 1942, which was directed to Reich Commissioner Lohse: 565 “Re: Evacuation of Jews from Germany to Minsk. The letter of January 5, 1942, from the Herr City Commissioner of Minsk, copy enclosed, of which I a sk you to take note, was sent to me. According to a communication of the Reich Security Headquarters im- parted to me, it was planned to send 25,000 Jews from the Reich to Minsk, who were supposed to be accommodated in the ghetto there. Of these, 7- 8,000 Jews have reached Minsk. The rest who remained behind cannot be transferred to Minsk at this time due to transportation difficulties. As soon as these difficulties are removed, how ever, the arrival of these Jews in Minsk must be reckoned with. I ask to instruct the City Commissioner of Minsk in this regard and I further request him to contact the Senior Police Chief in charge with regard to the question of accommodating and feeding the Jews.

In order to bring the Jews firstly under effective supervision, inde- pendent of later measures yet to be taken, Jewish Councils of Elders were employed, which are responsible to th e Security Police and the SD for the attitude of their racial comrades.

Lastly, the Jews have been made recognizable by a yellow badge to be worn on the chest and back, after the manner of the Jewish star introduced in the Reich territory. In order to evaluate the labor potential of the Jews, they are generally being taken into the pr ivate labor assignments and employed in cleaning up. With these measures, the foundations for the later intended final solu- tion of the European Jewish question have been created for the White Rus- sian territory as well.” The measures were nothing other than the concrete carrying out of the pol- icy as laid out in the ‘Brown Portfolio,’ which intended a future solution of the Jewish problem “ for all of Europe after the war .” 7. Numerical Data of Direct Transports to the Eastern Territories The existing railway documents 568 make it possible for us to draw only a part of the entire picture of the transports of Jews directly into the eastern ter- ritories. The transports arriving from the territory of the Reich were organized by the German Reichsbahn (Reichsbahndirektion in Königsberg), whose duty was to inform all departments involved. The transports received the abbrevia- tion ‘ Da ’ 569 and were numbered consecutively. The empty trains, designated by ‘ Lp ,’ were assigned numbers above 1,000.

Initial Situation Since, according to orthodox historians , the Germans in the occupied So- viet territories are supposed to have pu rsued a policy of systematic extermina- tion of Jews, we must deal with the objection that at the end of the day it does not matter whether the Jews were gassed in Poland in extermination camps or, after their deportation to the east, were shot there. For this reason we will now turn to the question of whether this sy stematic extermination of Jews in the eastern territories actually occurred. In clarifying this question, the examina- tion of the Einsatzgruppen and their missions will play a central role. Soon after the German invasion into the USSR, four Einsatzgruppen alto- gether numbering 3,000 men – including non-combat troops such as vehicle drivers, interpreters, and radiomen 576 – became operational in the conquered regions. One of their missions indisputably consisted of securing the rear, i.e. , fighting against partisans. According to the official historiography, however, other, more sinister tasks were assigned to the Einsatzgruppen beyond this. By referring to a post-war affidavit by Otto Ohlendorf, 577 leader of Einsatzgruppe D, Raul Hilberg summarizes as follows: 578 “According to Ohlendorf, the commanders of the Einsatzgruppen were briefed by Himmler personally. They we re informed that an important part    576 Raul Hilberg, op. cit. (note 17), pp. 289. From October 15, 1941, to February 1, 1942, the strength of Einsatzgruppe A sank from 990 to 909 men; the pe rcentage of combat troops fell from 725 men (= 73.2% of the total strength) to 588 (64.7%).

(Oct. 15, 1941), and RVA, 500-4-92, p. 183, “ Total Strength of Einsatzg ruppe A on 1 February 1942 .” 577 PS-3710. – However, Alfred St reim, Director of the Ludwigsburg Central Office for the Resolution of NS Crimes, wrote regarding this: “Ohlendorf‘s testimony and submissions concerning the inauguration of the ‘Führer Order’ [...] are false. In the Einsatzgruppen Trial the former Head of Einsatzgruppe D was able to get his co-defendants to submit to a line of defense put forward by him with the suggestion that if one had, from the very begin- ning, carried out the exterminat ion operations against the Jews on ‘order of the Führer,’ one could count upon a more lenient sentence.

The documents are supposed to have been found by the Allies in the offices of the Berlin Reichssicherhe itshauptamt. That the Germans let this sort of incriminating material fall into the hands of their enemies, although they could have easily burned the few stacks of papers in time, is strikingly odd. In fact, some revisionist research ers have expressed doubt in the authen- ticity of the incident reports and are of the opinion that at least in a portion of them we are dealing with manipulated documents. The main argument for this thesis lies in the absence of evidence for mass killings of the scope claimed; we shall return to this question. Fu rther grounds are advanced by Arthur Butz: 580 “They [the documents] were mimeographed, and signatures are most rare and, when they occur, appear on non-incriminating pages. Document NO-3159, for example, has a signature of a R. R. Strauch, but only on a covering page giving the locations of various units of the Einsatzgruppen . There is also NO-1128, allegedly from Himmler to Hitler reporting, among other things, the execution of 363,211 Russian Jews in August-November 1942. This claim occurs on page 4 of NO-1128, while initials said to be Himmler‘s occur on the irrelevant page 1. Moreover, Himmler’s initials were easy to forge: three vertical lin es with a horizontal line drawn through them.” Udo Walendy adds: 581 “As the American military court in the OKW Trial [Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, General Headquarters] already stated, even this court was surprised at how conspicuously vague the existing ‘USSR Event Reports’ were with respect to location, point in time, units, and other details such as troop strength, armaments, auxiliary forces, logistics etc. Merely the num- ber on a piece of paper, which was written or is supposed to have been    579 Ibid ., p. 390. 580 Arthur Butz, op. cit.

Chapters VI and VIII), but also to several reports of the Einsatzgruppen themselves. We have already determined that the “ reports from the occupied eastern territo- ries ” no. 9 from June 26, 1942, following a description of the ghettoization measures taken by the Security Police a nd the steps toward exploitation of the work force of the Ruthenian Jews, conclude as follows: 582 “With these measures, the foundations for the later intended final solu- tion of the European Jewish question have been created for the White Rus- sian territory as well.” Event Report no. 52 from August 14, 1941, proposed employing the great mass of the Jews in the following project: 583 “Cultivation of the Pripyet marshes and the marshes on the northern Dnieper as well as the Volga.” In the following, we restrain ourselves from taking any position regarding the authenticity of the Event Reports and merely examine the question of whether the content of the documents, independent of their authenticity, re- flects historical facts. It can hardly be seriously contested that the Einsatzgruppen committed numerous mass shootings. For our subject, however, there are only two issues of decisive significance: Did the Einsatzgruppen receive the task of systematically exterminating the Soviet Jews? Were the western Jews, which had been deported into the eastern territo- ries, treated like the Soviet Jews? 2. Reasons for Mass-Shootings With regard to the first of the two qu estions we have raised, it can be val- idly affirmed that the policy of the shooting of Jews was not directed against all eastern Jews and also was not generally directed against Jews as such. In a memorandum written on April 29, 1941, Alfred Rosenberg had laid out: 584    582 See Chapter VI, Section 6. 583 See Chapter VIII, Section 5. 584 PS-1024."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 206 “The Jewish problem, whose temporary transitional solution must be settled (compulsory labor of the Jews, ghettoization, etc.), calls for a gen- eral treatment.” On May 7, 1941, Rosenberg established in his “ Instructions for a Reichs- kommissar in the Ukraine ”: 585 “After the removal of the Jews from all public positions, which will oc- cur as a matter of course, the Jewish problem will experience a crucial so- lution through the establishment of ghettos or labor gangs. Compulsory labor is to be introduced.” The ‘Brown Portfolio,’ in the paragraph “ Class of Population ,” distin- guished two categories of eastern Jews: 586 “In the individual Reich Kommissariats and within these in the General Kommissariats, Jewry comprises a vari ously large portion of the general population. For example, in White Russi a and in the Ukraine there are mil- lions of Jews who have been resident here for generations. In the central territories of the USSR, on the other hand, a far greater portion of the Jews has moved there only during the Bolshevist era. A special group is formed by Soviet Jews, who have intruded into eastern Poland, western Ukraine, western White Ruthenia, the Baltic c ountries, Bessarabia, and Bukovina in the train of the Red Army in 1939 and 1940. To a certain extent, a varied manner of handling these different groups is in place. First and foremost, the Jews who have moved into the territories newly occupied by the Soviets in the past tw o years, insofar as they have not fled, are to be removed with severe meas ures. Since these groups have made themselves hated to a great degree due to their terrorizing of the populace, their elimination has already been ta ken care of for the most part by the populace itself at the appearance of German troops. These sorts of retalia- tory measures are not to be opposed. The rest of the resident Jewish popu- lation is first of all to be registered by the introduction of the obligation to report. All Jews are being marked by visible symbols (yellow Jewish stars).” The “ Soviet Jews ” were shot, while the great majority of the remaining resident Jewish population was ghettoiz ed. But also many other eastern Jews were killed: on account of sabotage, anti-German activities, as carriers of dis- eases, and above all as retaliatory measures for partisan attacks. This emerges clearly already from the first reports of the Einsatzgruppen . Here is an excerpt from one of these reports: 587    585 PS-1028. 586 In: Grüne Mappe , op. cit.

It was found frequently that Jewish women displayed especially rebel- lious behavior. For this reason, 28 Jewesses in Krugloye and in Mogilev 337 Jewesses had to be shot. In Borissov 331 Jewish saboteurs and 118 Jewish looters were exe- cuted. In Bobruisk 380 Jews were shot who had been conducting, right up to the end, defamatory and atrocity propaganda against the German occupa- tion troops. In Tatarsk the Jews had arbitrarily left the ghetto and returned to their old quarter, where they were attempting to drive out the Russians mean- while billeted there. All male Jews and 3 Jewesses were shot. At the estab- lishment of a ghetto in Sandrudubs the Jews in part resisted, so that 272 Jews had to be shot. Among them was a political Commissar. The Jews in Mogilev also tried to sabotage their resettlement into the ghetto. 113 Jews were liquidated. In addition 4 Jews were shot for refus al to work, and 2 Jews because they mistreated wounded German soldiers and had not put on the pre- scribed symbol. 222 Jews were shot in Talka on account of anti-German propaganda, and 996 Jews in Marina Gorka because they were sabotaging orders is- sued by the German occupation authorities. Another 627 Jews were shot at Shklov because they took part in acts of sabotage. Due to extreme danger of infection, the liquidation of Jews lodged in the ghetto in Vitebsk was begun. There were approximately 3,000 Jews.” As we shall see in the following section, there are good reasons to doubt the preceding figures. But the text does prove that the Einsatzgruppen were not given the mission of the complete extermination of the Jews, since other- wise the distinction between the Jews executed for specific reasons and the rest of the Jews would of cour se have been totally superfluous. The most logical argument for the mass shootings actually carried out by the Einsatzgruppen might therefore be that, which the Jewish historian Arno Mayer summarizes as follows: 588 “Even so, and notwithstanding the unparalleled magnitude of the Jew- ish suffering, the extermination of eastern Jewry never became the chief objective of Barbarossa. The fight for Lebensraum and against bolshevism was neither a pretext nor an expedient for the killing of Jews. Nor was it a    588 Arno Mayer, Why did the Heavens not Darken?

The assault on the Jews was unquestionably intertwined with the assault on bolshevism from the very outset. But this is not to say that it was the dominant strand in the hybrid ‘Judeobolshevism’ that Barbarossa tar- geted for destruction. In fact, the war against the Jews was a graft onto or a parasite upon the eastern campaign, which always remained its host, even or especially once it beca me mired deep in Russia. When they set forth on their mission, Einsatzgruppen and the RSHA were not given the extermination of Jews as their principal, let alone their only, assignment.” According to Mayer, the massacres of the eastern Jews was not part of a comprehensive plan of extermination, but occurred as the result of the inexo- rable radicalization of the war in the east and because the eastern Jews were classified by the SS as carriers of Bolshevism. 3. The Scale of the Shootings The shootings carried out by the SS in no way possessed the scope ascribed to them by the orthodox historians, for the numbers mentioned in the relevant reports can not be confirmed objectively and in many cases are demonstrably wrong. We now cite some examples: a. The Number of Jews Killed in Latvia In a long general report concerning the activity of Einsatzgruppe A the fol- lowing data were given: 589 “The total number of Jews in Latvia in the year 1935 was: 93,479 or 4.7% of the whole population. [...] At the entry of German troops there were still 70,000 Jews in Latvia. The rest had fled with the Bolshevists. [...] Up until October 1941, about 30,000 Jews were executed by this Son- derkommando. The remaining Jews, still indispensable due to economic importance, were collected in ghetto s. Following the processing of crimi- nal cases on the basis of not wearing the Jewish star, black marketing, theft, fraud, but also on account of preventing danger of epidemics in the ghettos, further executions were carried out afterwards. Thus, on Novem- ber 9, 1941, 11,034 were executed in D ünaburg, 27,800 in Riga at the be- ginning of December 1941 by an operation ordered and carried out by the Senior SS- and Police Chief, and 2,350 in Libau in mid-December 1941. At    589 “ Einsatzgruppe A, Gesamtbericht vom 16 Oktober 1941 bis 31 Januar 1942 ”, RGVA, 500- 4-92, pp. 57-59."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Chapter VII: The Role of the Einsatzgr uppen in the Occupied Eastern Territories 209 this time there are Latvia n Jews in the ghettos (aside from the Jews from the Reich) in: Riga approximately 2,500 Dünaburg \" 950 Libau \" 3,000.”  Let us summarize: Jews present at the entry of German troops: 70,000 Jews shot up to October 1941: 30,000 Ghetto Jews shot (11,034+27,800+2,350=): 41,184 Ghetto Jews still living (2,500+950+300=): 3,750 But if we add together the numbers of those shot (30,000 + 41,184 =) 71,184 and those still living in the ghe ttos (3,750), we get 74,934 Jews, a number which is higher than the number allegedly present at the entry of the Germans into Latvia. In a table that summarizes the report and bears the title “ Number of executions carried out by Einsatzgruppe A up to February 1, 1942 ,” the number of those shot is stated as 35,238, to which are added 5,500 Jews killed “ by pogroms ,” but “ from December 1, 1941 ;” 590 we therefore have 40,738 Jewish victims. Although this figure includes an additional 5,500 Jews killed in pogroms not mentioned in the re port, the total number of those shot is far lower: 40,738 as opposed to 71,184. b. The Number of Jews Killed in Lithuania No less strange are the corresponding figures for Lithuania: 591 “According to one census, up until the entry of the Bolshevists 153,743 Jews were living in Lithuania in the year 1929, which thus constituted 7.58% of the entire population. [...] In many single actions a total of 136,421 Jews were liquidated. [...] Jews in the ghettos: Kauen approximately 15,000 Jews  Vilna  \" 15,000  Jews Schaulen \" 4,500 Jews.” In adding the numbers of those shot (136,421) and those still living in the ghettos (34,500), we arrive at a figure in this case as well, which is higher than the initial number (153,743). If, however, one assumes that, as in the case of Latvia, approximately 25% of the Jewish population had fled with the Bolshe- vists, then the number of Jews still presen t in Lithuania at the entry of the Germans would have been far lower: approximately 115,000.    590 Ibid ., p. 184. 591 Ibid ., pp. 59-61."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 210 c. Lithuanian Jews in Terr itories Annexed by the Reich Gerald Reitlinger writes that up to the point in time when Franz Stahlecker, head of Einsatzgruppe A, composed his report, 50,000 Jews had been living in Latvia and Lithuania (as opposed to the 38,250 mentioned by Stahlecker), but that the number of surviving Jews was significantly higher because some Lithuanian areas – the Memelland and the region around Suwa ł ki and Grodno – had been incorporated into the Reich . Approximately 40,000 Jews lived in the two ghettos of Grodno, and 18,435 Jews were still living in the Königs- berg district, to which Memel and Suwa ł ki belonged, at the end of 1942, con- sisting almost exclusively of “ Soviet Russian Jews ” 592 , according to the Kor- herr Report. d. Simferopol and the Manstein Trial General Field Marshall Erich von Mans tein was Commander of the Elev- enth Army and was fighting on the Black Sea and in the Crimea. In 1949, he came before a British military court in Hamburg on charges of complicity in the massacres committed by Einsatzgruppe D. His defense counsel was the Englishman Reginald T. Paget, who wrote a book – translated into German the year after – about the trial in 1951. 593 In it, he reports the following con- cerning the activities of Einsatzgruppe D in the Crimea: 594 “To me, the numbers stated by the SD appeared to be entirely impossi- ble. Individual companies of about 100 men with about 8 vehicles are de- clared to have killed 10,000 to 12,000 Jews in two or three days. Since, as one will recall, the Jews believed in a resettlement and consequently took their belongings along with them, the SD could not possibly have trans- ported more than twenty or thirty Jews respectively in one truck. For each vehicle, with loading, 10 km of driving, unloading and return, an estimated two hours had to elapse. The Russian winter day is short and there was no night driving. In order to kill 10,0 00 Jews, at least three weeks would have been necessary. In one case we were able to check the numbers. The SD claimed to have killed 10,000 Jews in Simferolpol in November and declared the city free of Jews in December. Through a series of counter-tests, we were able to prove that the shooting of Jews in Simferopol had taken place on a single day, namely on November 16. There was only a single SD company in Sim-   592 G. Reitlinger, op. cit.

The length of sentence was later decreased to 12 years and von Manstein was released in May 1953. 594 Reginald T.

The place for the execution was situated 15 km away from the city. The number of victims could not have been greater than 300, and these 300 were in all probability not only Jews, but a collection of different elements who were under suspicion of belonging to the resistan ce movement. The Simferopol affair leaked out at the time of the trial to broad strata of the public, since it was being mentioned by the sole living witness to the charge, an Austrian private by the name of Gaffal. He claimed that he had heard the Jewish operation mentioned in a sappers’ mess, where he was the ordnance man, and that he had passed by the place of execution near Simferopol. After this testimony we received a quantity of letters and were able to produce several witnesses who had stayed near Jewish families in the Quarter and reported about the re ligious services in the synagogue as well as a Jewish market, where they bought icons and junk goods – up to the time of Manstein‘s departure from the Crimea and afterwards. There was no doubt at all that the Jewish community in Simferopol had continued to exist openly, and although some of our opponents had heard rumors of violence by the SD against the Jews in Simferopol, it nevertheless ap- peared that the Jewish community was unaware of any particular danger.” e. Babi Yar In the “ Activity and Situation Report no. 6 of the Einsatzgruppen of the Se- curty Police and the SD in the USSR ,” we read this concerning the time period from October 1 to 31, 1941: 595 “In Kiev all the Jews were arrest ed and on September 29 and 30, a to- tal of 33,771 Jews were executed.” This deals with the (in)famous ‘Mas sacre of Babi Yar.’ However, as Udo Walendy and Herbert Tiedema nn have proved, this did not happen, at least not remotely in the scope claimed. 596 Presumable near Kiev, as in Simferopol, several hundred people were shot. We will come back to the case of Babi Yar. f. Jews in Lithuanian Ghettos and Camps who Were Unfit for Work The reports of the Einsatzgruppen are not only questionable with respect to the number of Jews shot, but also with respect to their category.    595 102-R.

If the Einsatzgruppen had to liquidate all Jews or at least all Jews unfit for labor, then how is it that these 3,693 children were not murdered at the (al- leged) dissolution of the Ghetto no. 2 in October 1942? How little the threat of death was hove ring over these children can be gath- ered from the following description of the school system in the ghetto of Vilna, furnished by Abraham Foxman: 603 “Some days after the establishment of the ghetto, in 1941, a group of teachers founded a ‘Farein,’ [Verein = association/club] which later or- ganized the educational system of the ghe tto. At the first enrollment for the school, 3,000 children were registered. In the beginning, participation in classes was voluntary. In April 194 3, it then became obligatory: ‘Directive no. 3, issued by the ghetto deputies on April 28, 1943, an- nounces the attendance at the ghetto school s to be obligatory. All children from five to thirteen must attend the ghetto schools, which are free of cost. [...] The block chief is responsible for seeing that all children of obligatory school age take part in classes.’ In the first year of the ghetto, more than twenty educational units were founded, which comprised over 80% of the school-age children of the ghetto. Schools as well as H.K.P. – work institutions – were also founded in Kauen. Gens [604] received permission from the Germans to fence-in an area in the woods outside of the ghe tto.

The remaining 18 hours were devoted to work in the kitchen, visiting students and parents in their home, the repair of books and note- books, as well as the conducting of various assemblies.” On May 12, 1944, ‘Russian bandits’ att acked several institutions in Lithua- nia and looted them, among them: 605 “At the Bohumelischki Jewish camp – 1592 – approx. 300 women, men and children, 5 to 6 MPI, some rifles.” g.

Transfers of Baltic Jewi sh Children to Stutthof In the summer of 1944, numerous transports of Jews went from the former ghetto of Kaunas (Lithuania)– transformed into a concentrations camp in fall 1943 – and from the ghetto of Riga (Latvia) to Stutthof. From July 12 to Oc- tober 14, ten transports with a total of 10,458 Jews from Kaunas and six trans- ports with a total of 14,585 Jews from Riga 608 arrived in that camp located east of Danzig (today called Gdansk). As has already been established earlier, in these transports, whose lists of names are fragmentarily preserved, there were quite a number of Baltic Jews (but othe rs as well) of 15 years of age and un- der, who were designated on the lists as boys or girls. In the transport of July 12, 1944, which included 3,098 deportees (510 of them are known by name), there were 80 children of this category. On the list of July 19, there are 88 children among 1,097 deportees (all but two known by name). The following table gives information about the number of children and their respective age groups.

Operation 1005 After the discovery of the mass graves of Katyn and Vinnitsa by the Ger- mans, Soviet propaganda switched over to a counter-attack by mainly using two ploys: it attempted to place the bl ame for atrocities committed by the So- viet secret service, the NKVD (predecess or of the KGB), on the Germans, and it claimed it had discovered mass graves of victims of the Germans. As is well known, on April 13, 1943, in the forest of Katyn not far from Smolensk, the Germans, following directions from the local populace, found seven mass graves with a total of 4,143 bodies of Polish officers who had been shot. Between April and June, these were examined by a commission, which included medical doctors from 12 Europ ean nations, and further by a commis- sion of the Polish Red Cross and by Amer ican, British, and Canadian officers who were prisoners of war. The Germ ans published an extraordinarily well- documented official dossier afterwards, which contained all the forensic re- sults of the investigation, 80 photographs, and the names of the victims identi- fied. 613 The massacre of Vinnitsa (Ukraine) was uncovered by the Germans at the beginning of June 1943. At three different discovery sites, a total of 97 mass graves, they found the mortal remains of 9,432 Ukrainians who had been mur- dered by the Soviets. No fewer than 14 commissions, 6 foreign ones among them, examined the graves in the period from June 24 to August 25.

On January 15, 1944, this com- mission also invited a group of western journalists. This attempt, heavily freighted with propaganda, at falsification of history is also evidenced by means of the 38 dos siers with documents dealing with the Katyn case, which can be found today in the archives of the Russian Federa- tion in Moscow. 615 At the Nuremberg Trial, where the Soviets brazenly blamed the Germans for the crime, th e subject of Katyn came up at several sessions, 616 while the mass murder of Vinnit sa was mentioned only a single time, and then only tangentially by th e Bulgarian court doctor Marko A. Markov, a member of the investigatory commission on Katyn called by the Germans three years before. 617 In order to make the crimes of Katyn and Vinnitsa forgotten or at least to suppress them, the Soviets carried out a thorough investigation of all actual or invented crimes, which the Germans ha d committed in the territory recon- quered by the Red Army. For this purpo se, an investigatory commission was established at literally every small town. Since the Soviets had learned from Katyn the enormous propaganda effect of pictures, these commissions photo- graphed all mass graves and bodies f ound. If, however, the bodies were too small in number, then they resorted to the trick of photogr aphing them several times from different angles in order to create the impression that their number was greater. The case of Osarichi illustrates this manipulatory technique especially tell- ingly. On March 12, 1944, the Commander of the 35th Infantry Division of the Wehrmacht, Lieutenant General Richte r, ordered the White Russian populace of that area to be interned in two cam ps not far from the village of Osarichi. There was no infrastructure in these camps and those confined there had to    614 Amtliches Material zum Massenmord von Winniza , Berlin 1944. 615 GARF, 7021-114-1/38. 616 Cf. for example IMT , Vol. VII, p. 425-428 (Conclusions of the Soviet Investigatory Com- mission), and Document USSR-54.

The ‘Extraordinary State Commission for the Determination of the Crimes of the German Fascist Conquerors’ dis- patched an investigatory group.” Military correspondents, who took nume rous photographs after the libera- tion of the two camps, 619 belonged to this investigatory group.

At first the guarding soldiers forced th em to throw or to stack the bodies into the pits especially excavated for that purpose near the fence. But with each day there were more and more bodies, and they remained lying among the living.” Thus, the bodies were neither removed nor concealed, but could be seen by anyone. When the Army photographers arrived at the scene, they sure found a horrible tableau, yet not quite horrible enough.

For this reason the photographers resorted to a trick: they photographed the bodies from nine different angles and the photos then gave the impression that one was looking at several dozen dead bodies. 630 A single body, which was lying somewhat off to the side of the rest, was photographed four times. 631 In four other photos, an additional seven bodies not far distant from the rest can be recognized. 632 In all, the first 15 photographs, which surely constitute the most terrible scenes to be found in the camp, show 15 bodies. Another horrible view was that of a ditch, of which one can see only the end in the photo; it is basically empty in the rear, and in the foreground are 7 or 8 bodies. The picture is a good fit for the 6 m × 3 m × 2 m pit previously described and contains 15 bodies. 633 Further 14 photos show a total of 16 bodies. 634 Doubtless this photographic documentation was somewhat too meager in order to confirm the death of between 8,000 and 49,000 human beings or – which flatly contradicts this number – the presence of even 600 bodies on the camp property! A no less typical case is Babi Yar. As we have already emphasized, a re- port of the Einsatzgruppen speaks of 33,771 Jews shot there. According to the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust , the bodies were exhumed and burned by a 327-man ‘Sonderkommando’ between A ugust 18 and September 19, 1943. 635 On November 9, 1944, Major Lavre nko, member of the Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes in Kiev, questioned the Jewish witness Vladimir K. Davidov. The latter stated that on August 18, 1943, he, along with 99 other prisoners, for the most part also Jewish, had been selected from the Siretzki concentration camp 5 km from Kiev. The 100 prisoners were taken to Babi Yar and there were forced to dig up the bodies of the Jews shot in 1941. According to him, 70,000 bodies had been in the mass graves of Babi Yar. The prisoners had exhumed thes e and burned them on ‘ovens’ after- wards, which consisted of granite blocks – procured from the Jewish cemetery of Kiev – with train rails laid upon them. On these a layer of wood was piled and on top of this the bodies, so that an enormous stack of bodies 10 to 12 m high resulted! In the beginning there was merely a single ‘oven,’ but then 75 of them (literally seventy-five) were built.    630 Ibid ., photos 1-8 and 11, photo documents on unnumbered pages. 631 Ibid ., photos 8-11. 632 Ibid ., photos 12-15. 633 Ibid ., photo 22. 634 Ibid ., photos 16-21, 22-26, 28, 31f.

The witness reports: “On September 25 and 26, [636] when the work was nearly finished, the construction of another oven was or dered, upon which we ourselves were supposed to be cremated. We deduced this from the fact that there were no more corpses in Babi Yar, but we had built an oven nevertheless.” In order to escape their own murder, Davidov and a number of his com- rades (35 to 40) escaped during the night of September 29, in which attempt at least ten of them were killed. 637 The Black Book of Ilja Ehrenburg and Vassily Grossman summarizes this witness testimony, but alters a few numbers. 638 The statements made in the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust quite obviously have their origin in this source. This Vladirmir K. Davidov is appare ntly the only witness who claims to have participated in the cremation of bodies of Babi Yar. His tale is wholly unbelievable. The number of bodies – 70,000 – is more than double the num- ber shot according to the Event Report, which in itself is already hugely ex- cessive. The tale of the 10 to 12 m tall mountain of bodies is technically ab- surd, as we pointed out in the fourth ch apter. The claim, according to which 75 ‘ovens’ of the kind first described by the witness are supposed to have been built, stands in contradiction to the number of victims given by him, since there then would have been (75 × 3,000 =) 225,000 bodies to be burned! Insofar as the date is concerned, the witness maintains that the cremation of the bodies was finished on September 25 or 26. On this day, the prisoners had built the last ‘oven’ for themselves. On September 26, the Luftwaffe took an aerial photograph of the area, in which Babi Yar was located. John Ball has published it with the following commentary: 639 “Photo 2 – September 26th, 1943: This photo was taken one week after the end of the supposed mass cre- mations in the ravine. [640] If 33,000 people were exhumed and burned evi- dence of vehicles and foot traffic to supply the fuel should be evident in the area where the Jewish cemetery meets Babi Yar ravine, however there is no evidence of traffic either on the end of the narrow road that proceeds to the ravine from the end of Melnik Street, or on the grass and shrubbery within or on the sides of the cemetery.”    636 The word “ August ” appears in the text, which however is an obvious error.

The Black Book mentions an even later date: 642 “On September 28, when the work wa s just completed, the Germans ordered the prisoners to light the fire.” With the data specified in the fourth chapter, the cremation of 33,771 bod- ies would have required approximately 4,500 tons of firewood and approxi- mately 430 tons of wood ashes and about 190 tons of human ashes would have been generated by the process. Moreover, several dozen tons of granite (gravestones and monuments) would have had to have been transported from the Jewish cemetery to Babi Yar and back again in order to construct the sup- ports for the 75 ‘ovens.’ If the claims put forward about Babi Yar were true, all of this would have had to leave behind unmistakable traces on the air photo of September 26, 1943. After the Soviets had reconquered Kiev, an investigatory commission made its way to Babi Yar and took so me photographs, which were immortal- ized in an album. Three of the photos supposedly show a first and a second “ zone where the bodies were burned .” 643 In another, the “ remnants of the ov- ens and the grotto, into which the prisoners who had cremated the bodies had escaped ” are allegedly shown. 644 The captions to these pictures are absurd; the only actual, clearly recognizable objects are a few rotted shoes and some rags, which were painstakingly photographed by the Soviets and were described as follows: 643    641 John Ball, Air Photo Evidence , op. cit.

If, however, the Soviets took such great pains to docu- ment things, which had no connection w ith the charges, what a propaganda circus would they have put on if they had really discovered mass graves with a total of far more than a million murdered Jews (as well as countless non- Jews)? Yet such a propaganda circus fa iled to occur, since the Soviets found nothing, which would have been comparable to the discoveries made by the Germans in Katyn and Vinnitsa! The obj ection that they had not been in the position to locate the murder sites would be wholly untenable. Lastly, the Germans, with the assistance of the civilian populace, had discovered 97 mass graves of murdered Ukrainians. As we saw in the third chapter, the Soviets pinpointed three mass graves and 13 individual graves in the area around Treblinka I, and the Poles found 41 mass graves of victims of an epidemic. If, therefore – to take the number given by Raul Hilberg – the bodies of the barely one-and-a-half million Soviet Jews – killed chiefly by the Einsatzgrup- pen , but also by Wehrmacht, SS, police units, and Rumanians – as well as the countless non-Jewish victims were not able to be found, they must have been eliminated, i.e. cremated. For that reason, the legal system and historiography needed the ‘ Aktion 1005’ (Operation 1005) or ‘ Sonderaktion 1005’ (Special Operation 1005), about which we have already briefly written in the fourth chapter. This is implicitly conceded even by the official historiography: 645 “Although burning the bodies from the mass graves did not efface the Nazi crimes, it did cause difficulties in determining the facts of the crimes and in drawing up statistics on the numbers of victims. In many cases, the commissions investigating Nazi crimes in the USSR and in Poland found no trace of the mass graves, and they encountered difficulty in reaching es- timates.” In other words: material evidence fo r the mass murder of an enormous number of people, the ‘ corpus delicti ,’ was not found, but this is a mere ‘de- tail’! The most recent investigations have al so led to negative results in this re- spect. Here is an example. According to a report of December 1, 1941, of the Commander of the Security Police and the SD Einsatzkommando 3, the fol- lowing persons were shot in Mariam pole (Lithuanian: Mariyampol) on Sep- tember 1, 1941: 646    645 Encyclopedia of the Holocaust , op. cit.

In order to build the Memorial at the correct locati on, they tried to find where the mass graves are. They excavated the site de scribed by the witnesses, but did not find a trace.” Every time the Soviets had discovered bodies of victims of the Germans, they photographed them, even in little-known places like the camp Siretzki in the Ukraine. 648 In Auschwitz-Birkenau they found 536 bodies, which were all autopsied. 649 The dead were solemnly interred in the presence of numerous people. Photos were taken of th is and many scenes were filmed. 650 Let us now turn to the question of what the official historiography tells us about the alleged ‘Operation 1005’ and u pon what sources this is based. In the article from the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust it says: 651 “Operation 1005, code name for a la rge-scale activity that aimed to obliterate the traces of the murder of m illions of human beings by the Nazis in occupied Europe.” The decision to allow this operation to start up is supposed to have been made in Berlin at the beginning of 194 2. A letter of February 20, 1942, from the Chief of the Gestapo, Heinrich Müller, to Martin Luther of the Foreign Of- fice, 652 in which the subject of the unsatisfactory burial of corpses is raised and which is supposed to have been written after Müller “ had received an anonymous letter complaining about the corpses flooding the W ARTHEGAU area ,” is cited as proof. 651 This letter bears the file designation “ IV B 4 43/42 gRs (1005) ,” 653 and the alleged ‘Operation 1005’ is supposed to have gotten its name from this document!

This would mean that the designation ‘1005’ for the operation would have been assigned a full five months after its start! On the other hand, in the letter the Jews are referred to as “ dead ,” not ‘shot’ or ‘killed.’ More- over, the disposal of the bodies could take place by cremation or burial , which means that the Himmler letter need ha ve no connection with the excavation and cremation of corpses of Jews who had been shot, and what we are dealing with here is a primitive hoax. According to official historiography, 651 SS- Standartenführer Paul Blobel took charge of ‘Operation 1005’ and “ The operation commenced in June 1942 with attempts to burn the corpses in the C HE Ł MNO extermination camp .” 651 In the initial phase, the bodies in the alleged eastern extermination camps are supposed to have been exhumed and crem ated. We have dea lt with this issue in detail in Chapter IV, in the prototypical case of Treblinka. The second phase is supposed to have lasted from the beginning of June 1943 until the end of July 1944. During its course, the mass graves on Soviet and Polish territory are supposed to have been emptied and the traces of the massacres eradicated. The Encyclopedia of the Holocaust shows a map with the most important locations where these activities are supposed to have transpired. This is a huge area, which extends from north to sout h across approximately 1,500 km (from the North Sea to the Black Sea) and from west to east across about 1,300 km (from west Poland to the German-Soviet front). 655 Beginning with the camp Janowska at Lemberg, this area is s upposed to have been assigned its own ‘ Sonderkommado 1005,’ which consisted of officers of the Sicherheitsdienst (Security Service) and from the Sicherheitspolizei (SIPO, Security Police), of men from the Ordnungspolizei (regular police) and of dozens or hundreds of – mostly Jewish – prisoners , whose task was the hands-on execution of the work. ‘Sonderkommando 1005-A’ and ‘Sonderkommando 1005-B’ are sup-   654 A.

This means that within a period of 13 months they had to have emp- tied thousands of graves at hundreds of locations, which we re scattered over an enormous area – all of this without leaving behind any material or docu- mentary traces! Without having thousands of maps, on which the graves were marked, it would quite obviously have been impossible to locate those thousands of mass graves in a territory of more than 1.2 million square kilometers, but neither are such maps mentioned in even a single Einsatzgruppe report or any other document, nor have such maps ever been found among the German docu- ments captured by the victors of World War II.

At the proceedings of February 9, 1946, at the Nuremberg Trial, the Senior Counsel Smirnov read out excerpts from the protocol “ of the interrogation of Gerhard Adametz (Exhibit USSR-80, Document Number USSR-80), taken by an American army lieutenant, Patrick McMahon ,” in which there was talk of the activities of the “ Sonderkommando 1005-A ” and “ 1005-B .” 664 In 1946, the work written by Leon Weliczker Brygada Ś mierci (The Death Brigade), the longest and most deta iled witness report about the ‘Brigade 1005,’ appeared in Lodz, which Thom as Sandkühler, once again politely using understatement, rates as follows: 665 “The horrifying notes of Weliczker have only insignificant evidentiary value.” Or, to put it another way, they have none! The SS- Standartenführer Paul Blobel was, however, unknown to this wit- ness. He was connected to the ‘Operati on 1005’ by an Erwin Schulz, who had been the leader of Einsatzkommando V of the Einsatzgruppe C of the Sicher- heitspolizei from the beginning of the Russian Campaign until September 1941 and served under SS- Brigadeführer Rasch.

On December 20, 1945, he stated: 666 “About 1943 I learned during my activ ity as Chief of Department I of the RSHA that at this time the SS- Standartenführer Blobel had to make the mass graves unrecognizable of those who had been shot and liquidated in the territories to be evacuated by th e Wehrmacht. If I recall correctly, the cover-name for these mass graves was ‘water sites.’” Now all that remained was to put the individual parts together. In November 1946, Rudolf Höß wrote in the Krakow prison: 667 “Standartenführer Blobel had been authorized to seek out and obliter- ate all the mass graves in the whole of the eastern districts. His department was given the code number ‘1005.’” Finally, at the preliminary examinations of the trial against the Ein- satzgruppen , which took place in Nurember g from September 29, 1947, to February 12, 1948, Paul Blobel judged it expedient to ‘confess’ what had al- ready become ‘facts determined by virtue of official authority’ for the prose- cutors. In a ‘statutory declaration’ made at Nuremberg on June 6, 1947, he stated for the record: 668 “In June 1941, I became Chief of Sonderkommando 4 A. This Sonder- kommando was assigned to Einsatzgruppe C, the latter was under the command of Dr. Rasch. The special regi on assigned to me was located in the area of the 6th Army, which wa s commanded by field marshal von Rei- chenau. In January 1942, I was relieved as Chief of Sonderkommando 4 A and was transferred to Berlin for disci plinary reasons. I remained there for some time with no work. I was und er the supervision of Department IV, under the former Gruppenführer Müller. In the Fall of 1942, I was given the mission as Müller‘s deputy to drive into the occupied eastern territories and eradicate the traces of the mass graves which came about from the execu tions of the Einsatzgruppen. This was my mission up to the summer of 1944.” The American inquisitors gave every appearance of being unsatisfied with this ‘confession’ and forced Blobel to gi ve a further ‘statutory declaration.’ This time he expressed himself in more detail: 669 “After I had been relieved from this assignment, I had to report in Ber- lin to SS Obergruppenführer Heydrich and Gruppenführer Müller and in June 1942 was entrusted with the mission by Gruppenführer Müller of eradicating the traces of executions of the Einsatzgruppen in the east.

That Blobel in neither of his two declarati ons spoke of an ‘Operation 1005’ or a ‘Sonderkommando 1005’ played no role, for these little gaps were naturally closed by the historians! It should be well understood that we do not wish to claim by what we have said here that there was no opening of mass graves and cremation of bodies, any more than we are claiming that there were no shootings of Jews. But we are very much questioning the enormous scale, which the official historiogra- phy attributes to these occurrences. 5. The Fate of the Western Jews in the East The western Jews deported into the occupied eastern territories did not share, at least in the beginning, the fa te of the ‘Soviet Jews.’ Christopher R. Browning concedes: 670 “By the very fact that Hitler decided to kill all Russian Jews, [671] he broke through the vicious circle, which c onsisted of the fact that with every new military success a continually increasing number of Jews fell under German control. But the Jewish policy of the Nazis in the rest of Europe experienced thereby no direct alteration. They also continued speaking of emigration, deportation, and plans for a future Jewish homeland.” In the “ General Report of October 16, 1941, to January 21, 1942 ,” already mentioned, there is a section on the topic “ Jews from the Reich ,” in which it says: 672 “Since December 1940 [the correct year is 1941] , transports of Jews were arriving from the Reich at short intervals. Of these, 20,000 Jews were directed to Riga and 7,000 to Minsk. The first 10,000 Jews evacuated to Riga were accommodated partly in a pr ovisional reception camp, partly in a newly established hut-camp in the vicinity of Riga. The remaining trans- ports were at first sent into a detached section of the Riga ghetto.    670 Christopher R. Browning, “ La décision concernant la solution finale ,” in: L’Allemagne nazie et le génocide juif , op. cit.

Of the Jews from the Reich, only a small portion are fit for labor. Ap- proximately 70-80% are women and child ren as well as old persons not able to work. The mortalit y figures are climbing all the time, also as a re- sult of the unusually harsh winter. The output of the few Jews from th e Reich who are fit for work is satis- factory. As a work force they are more desirable th an the Russian Jews on account of their German language and th eir relatively greater cleanliness. The adaptability of the Jews is remarkable, with which they attempt to shape their life to conform to their circumstances. The present crowding together of the Je ws in the smallest space in all ghettos naturally causes a greater danger of epidemics, which is most ef- fectively countered by the employment of Jewish physicians. In special cases, Jews who have become contagiou sly ill were isolated under the pre- text of sending them to a Jewish old people’s home or hospital and exe- cuted.” In a letter of July 21, 1942, from Reichskommissar Lohse to the Stan- dartenführer Siegert of the RSHA, it says regarding a “ work training camp ” in Latvia: 673 “Of the Jews evacuated from the Re ich there are at present still 400 in the camp and employed in transporta tion and excavation work. The rest of the Jews deported to Riga ha ve been accommodated elsewhere.” These western Jews were therefore by no means systematically killed, al- though the majority of them were unfit for labor. This stands in striking con- trast to the alleged mass liquidations described in the same report of indige- nous Jews of Latvia already mentioned by us. No doubt, the natural mortality among these Jews was very high, and occa- sionally they also ran the danger of be ing killed, but a portion of them sur- vived the war. On the fragmentary lists of names of the Jews deported from Kaunas and Riga to Stutthof in the su mmer of 1944, there are at least 959 German Jews. One of them, Berthold Neufeldt, was born on June 17, 1936; 674 he therefore had been deported at the age of 5 or 6 and was still alive in the summer of 1944. In addition, at least 102 survivors are known from the Jewish deportations from Theresienstadt to Riga of January 9, 1942, and 15 survivors of the depor- tation of January 15 of the same year, besides 40 from the deportation of Sep- tember 1, 1942, to Estonian Raasiku.

The ‘Jewish Reservation’ of Lublin In September of 1939, directly after the military collapse of Poland, a pro- ject evolved to create a reservation fo r Jews on conquered Polish territory, into which all Jews living under German cont rol were supposed to be deported. The idea of establishing “ a Jewish state near Krakow under German admini- stration ” was already brought up by Heydrich on September 22 in a conversa- tion with Walter von Brauchitsch, the Supreme Commander of the Army, and then taken up by Alfred Rosenberg at a meeting on September 28 and 29 with the Gauleiters in the east. Rosenberg mentioned the plan to settle “ the whole of Jewry ” together with all undesirable elements “ between Weichsel and Bug .” In an official speech on September 29, Heydrich spoke of the establish- ment of a “ Reichsghetto ” in the region east of Warsaw and Lublin. 676 The Jewish reservation was supposed to be set up in the zone south of Lublin, ly- ing between Weichsel and Bug. One of the most important railway junctions in that region was Nisko, and for that reason it was referred to as the Nisko Plan or Nisko Operation. The Jewish tran sports into that region began in Oc- tober 1939 and went on until March 1940. On March 23, 1940, Göring or- dered the cessation of all deportations into the General Gouvernement. A total of approximately 34,520 Jews were deported from the Reich to the incorporated Polish territories, 677 and 6,615 Viennese Jews were deported into the ‘Reservation.’ 678 Mainly because of its competition with the Madagascar Plan, upon which all hopes of the Reich for the solution of the Jewish problem were focused at that time, the project came to a standstill soon after its begin- nings. Nevertheless, further Polish Jews were resettled in the Lublin ‘Reserva- tion’: 9,451 from the Radom district from August 14 to September 25, 1940, 679 3,436 from the Krakow ghetto from November 29, 1940, to April 2,    676 Seev Goshen, “ Eichmann und die Nisko-Aktion im Oktober 1939 ”, in: Viertelsjahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte , 1981, pp. 78f. 677 Janina Kie ł bo ń , “ Deportacja Ż ydów do dystryktu lubelskiego (1939-1943),” in: Zeszyty Ma- jdanka , XIV, 1992, p. 73. 678 W.

In 1941, 6,280 Jews were sent into the ‘Reservation’ from the incorporated Polish territories, 1,530 Jews from prison camps, 2,200 from Warsaw district and 2,520 from Krakow. 681 Therefore, from 1939 to 1941, a total of approximately 79,600 Jews arrive d in that zone. The transportation of western Jews into the Lublin district st arted again in March 1942, but this time within the framework of a new policy. 2. Transports of Jews into the Lublin District in 1942 At the beginning of 1942, the Germans began to concentrate the Polish Jews in the district of Lublin and then subsequently to deport them farther to the east in order to make room for the Jews from the Altreich , from the Ost- mark , from Slovenia, and from the Protectorate. These evacuations were ar- ranged by an office of the government of the General Gouvernement, the “ Hauptabteilung innere Verwaltung Ab teilung Bevölkerungswesen und Für- sorge ” (Main department internal administration, department of population and welfare), to which the sub-departme ntal manager Richard Türk as well as the local authorities delivered the corresponding reports. One of the first of these reports date s from January 6, 1942, and concerns the “ Evacuation of 2,000 Jews from Mielec.” There it says: 682 “1,000 Jews are coming to the admi nistrative district of Hrubieszow, their final destination Hrubieszow station. 1,000 Jews are coming to the administrative district of Cholm; the destination of 400 of them is the W ł o- dawa station, Parczew station is the fi nal destination of 600. Date after which these places will be ready to a ccept them is January 15, 1942.” The next report dealing with this transfer warned the authorities: 683 “I am asking you to absolutely see to it that the Jews are received at the station of their destination and are properly directed to locations as deter- mined by you; so that it does not happe n, as it has in other cases, that the Jews arrive at their station of destination without supervision and now are dispersed all across the country.” On January 21, 1942, the number of Jews being evacuated from Mielec was increased to 4,500. 684 The evacuation began on March 11, 1942. The 4,500 Jews were distributed as follows: 685    680 Ibid ., pp. 71f. 681 Ibid ., p. 73. 682 Józef Kermisz, Dokumenty i Materia ł y do dziejów okupacji niemieckiej w Polsce, Tom II, “Akce” i “Wysiedlenia ,” Warsaw-Lodz-Krakow 1946, p. 10. 683 Ibid ., p. 11. 684 Ibid ., p. 14."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Chapter VIII: Indirect Transports of Jews to the Eastern Territories 235 “1,500 to admin. dist. of Cholm, with the stations of destination being W ł odawa and Parczew . 1,000 to admin. distr.

The evacuation of Jews from Mielec ended on March 16. The rest of the Jews were “ accommodated in the Krakow dis- trict .” 686 On February 9, 1942, the “ resettlement of 1,500 Jews with the destination station W ł odawa (900 Jews) and Parczew (600 Jews) ” was announced. The directions of the government office charged with the resettlement, which were forwarded to the local authorities as supplements by Oberlandesverwaltungs- rat (Senior county administrative coun selor) Weirauch, prescribe the follow- ing: 687 “The office of the District of Lublin, Department of Internal Admini- stration and Department of Population and Welfare, remains responsible to me for seeing to it that the Jews, who are to settle in, get assigned suffi- cient lodging according to what is possible. The resettling Jews are to be allowed to take along their bedding. With respect to other baggage and household effects, 25 kg per person is allowed to be taken along. The Jews are to be medically monitored after th eir arrival in their new areas of set- tlement for 3 weeks. Every case, in which there is a suspicion of illness or typhus, is to be reported to the district physician without delay.” On March 22, 1942, there was a resettlement of Jews from Bilgoraj to Tar- nogrod, a village 20 km south of that city. The report that deals with this it reads: 688 “On March 22, 1942, an evacuation from Bilgoraj to Tarnogrod of 57 Jewish families with a total of 221 pers ons took place. Each family re- ceived a vehicle in order to take al ong the necessary pieces of furniture and beds. The Polish police and the special services unit took care of con- trol and supervision. The operation went as planned without mishaps. The evacuees were accommodated in Tarnogrod on the same day.” On March 17, 1942, Fritz Reuter, an employee of the Department of Popu- lation and Welfare of the Office of the General Gouvernement of the district of Lublin, wrote a note, in which he referred to a talk conducted on the previ-   685 Ibid ., p. 27. 686 Ibid ., p. 28. 687 Ibid ., p. 15. 688 Ibid ., p. 46."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 236 ous day with the SS- Hauptsturmführer Hans Höfle, the delegate for the reset- tlement of Jews in the Lublin district: 689 “I arranged for a talk with Hstuf. Höfle for Monday, the 16th of March 1942, namely at 17:30 hours. In the course of the discussion the following was explained by Hstuf. Höfle: It would be expedient to divide the transports of Jews arriving in the Lublin district already at the station of departure into employable and un- employable Jews. If it is not possible to make this distinction at the station of departure, one must eventually pa ss on to separating the transport in Lublin according to the aspects mentioned above. Unemployable Jews are all to come to Bezec [Be łż ec] , the outermost border station in the Zamosz district. Hstuf. Höfle is thinking of building a large camp, in which the employ- able Jews can be registered in a file sy stem according to their occupations and requested from there. Piaski is being made Jew-free and will be the collection point for the Jews coming out of the Reich. Trawnicki [Trawniki] for the present time is not occupied by Jews. H. asks where on the D ę blin-Trawnicki route 60,000 Jews can be unloaded. Informed about the Jewish tr ansports now running as far as we are concerned, H. explained that of the 500 Jews arriving in Susiec, those who were unemployable could be sorted out and sent to Bezec. According to a teletype of the government of March 4, 1942, a Jewish transport, whose destination was the Trawnicki station, is rolling out of the Protec- torate. These Jews are not unloaded in Trawnicki, but have been brought to Izbiza. An inquiry of the Zamosz district, asking to be able to request 200 Jews from there for work, was ans wered in the affirmative by H. In conclusion he stated that he could accept 4-5 tr ansports daily, of 1,000 Jews with the destination station of Bezec. These Jews would go across the border and would never come back into the General Gouverne- ment.” This document is of capital significance for two reasons. First, Höfle was the deputy Stabführer (staff leader) of the SS and Police Chief for the Lublin district (Otto Globocnik). According to official historiography, he coordinated in this capacity “ the construction of the extermination camp Belzec and the deportations to there from the Lublin district .” 690 Second, Be łż ec is supposed to have started its homicidal activity su bsequent to the talk reported, on March 17, 1942. According to official historiography, it was (like Treblinka, Sobibór,    689 Ibid ., pp. 32f. 690 Enzyklopädie des Holocaust , op. cit. (note 101), vol. II, p. 619.

Yet in the cited document it says: A subdivision of the Jews into those ab le to work and those not able to work was planned. The Jews able to work should be used for labor assignments. Be łż ec was supposed to become a camp, where the Jews fit to work were “ registered in a file system a ccording to their occupation .” This does not con- form in the least to a ‘pure extermination camp.’ The Jews unable to work were all supposed to go to Be łż ec. The camp was supposed “ to accept 4-5 transports daily, of 1,000 Jews with the destination station of Be [l] zec ,” clearly Jews unable to work, who are deported “ across the border ” and are supposed to never come back into the General Gouverne- ment. For that reason, Be łż ec was designated as “ the outermost border station in the Zamosz district .” This sentence has sense only in connection with a re- settlement beyond the border. Piaski was supposed to become the “ collection point for the Jews coming out of the Reich .” If one uses the road, it is another 24 km to Lublin, located to the northwest of Piaski, and 91 km to Be łż ec. With the train, the distance to Be łż ec is even greater (about 130 km). This contradicts the thesis, according to which Be łż ec was a pure extermination camp, since in this case the collec- tion point would have been the camp itself. It was intended to unload 60,000 Jews at a point on the D ę blin-Trawniki route. The former locale is 76 km northwest of Lublin (in the direction of Warsaw), Trawniki is 13 km east of Pi aski (for which it serves as rail station) on the Lublin-Rejowiec-Che ł m/Lublin-Be łż ec railroad line (before the Re- jowiec station, a junction of the rail line turns off south toward Be łż ec). This project as well fails to fall into line with the claim, according to which Be łż ec is supposed to have been a pure extermination camp. This fact is fully and entirely confirmed by a report of April 7, 1942. Its au- thor is SS- Hauptsturmführer Richard Türk, Director of the Department for Population and Welfare in the Office of the Governor of the Lublin district. The report refers to the month of Marc h and contains a paragraph with the heading “ Jewish Resettlement Operation of the SS- and Police Chief ,” in which Türk reports: “The possibilities of accommodation were and are currently being dis- cussed with the delegate of the SS- and Police Chief, that is, restricted to those stretching along the D ę blin-Rejowiec-Belzec railway line. Alterna- tive possibilities were determined. Due to my proposal, there is a basic understanding that, to the same degree as Jews from the west are be ing settled here, local Jews are to be evacuated, if possible. The current si tuation of the settling movement is that approximately 6,000 were settled h ere from the Reich, approximately"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 238 7,500 have been evacuated from the district and 18,000 from the city of Lublin.

On March 14, 1942, Mi ę dzyrzec, Radzyn district, received 750 Jews. On March 16, ‘42, the Hrubieszow district received 1,343 Jews, 843 of which have been accommodated in Dubi enka and 500 in Belz. The major- ity were women and children and only a minority of men fit for labor. On March 16, ‘42, the Zamosz district received 500 Jews, all of whom have been lodged in Cieszanow. On March 22, ‘42, 57 Jewish families with 221 persons have been shifted from Bilgoraj to Tarnogrod.” The influx of western Jews into the L ublin district began in the middle of March 1942. The first transports routed there departed from the Protectorate on March 11, 1942, from the Altreich on March 13, from Slovakia on March 27, from the Ostmark on April 9. The transports included numerous people unfit for labor, who were lodged in the v illages of the district together with those able to work. On April 12, 1942, the Chairman of the Jewish Council in Lublin posted a letter to Jewish Social Self-Assistance in Krakow, in which the “ numbers of those resettled in the individual towns ” were named in regard to Mielec: 692 “Be ł z  460  persons Cieszanów 465 persons Dubienka 787 persons Sosnowica 210 persons Mi ę dzyrzec 740 persons W ł odawa 770 persons” The letter continues: “In Izbica two transports arrived from the Protectorate with 1,000 per- sons.

Officially nothing could be determined yet. With regard to Lublin itself, an insignificant num- ber of Jews has remained in the city up to now, who are supposed to be re- settled from the city into its environs according to unofficial information.” On April 16, 1942, the Landkommissar (coumty commissioner) Lubartów sent the following letter to the Distri ct Chief of the Lublin district: 694 “Yesterday afternoon at 18:00 hours, without any prior announcement, another transport of approximately 800 Jews arrived.

Pohl, who was also present here on the occasion of th e evacuation of the local Jews on April 9. The Jews are at first lodged in the former high school. Whether and when the transport onward is to take place is not yet clear.” In another letter from May 13, 1942, it says: 696 “Herr District Chief of Cholm wa s present here personally yesterday and requested that those of the next transport, who are fit for labor, also be sent to him, since he is in urgent need of a work force. Futhermore, he complained about the fact that food, which is added to the transport trains, is always taken off in Lublin. I am asking that the food be passed on to Cholm as well at the next transports.” A similar complaint was also heard from the delegation of Rejowiec: 696    693 Dr. Marek Alten, Advisor for Jewish Affair s to the Governor of the Lublin District. 694 J.

The baggage of the evacuees has remained in Lublin, and the delegation requests that the bag- gage, which for the most part contains bed linens, be released.” In order to create room for the new arrivals, Polish Jews residing in the Lublin district were gradually deported farther east. These evacuations were initiated by the SS- and Police Chief of Lublin in collaboration with the “ Sub- Department of Population and Welfare ” of the Governor of the district of Lublin, and namely on the proposal of the local authorities. For example, a certain Lenk, a subordinate of the District Chief of Janów-Lubelsk, wrote to the SS- and Police Chief of Lublin: 697 “I ask you to evacuate Jews in the following locations: Radomysl 500 Zaklikow 1,500 Annopol 500 Ulanow I 500 Modliborzyce 1,000 Janów-Lubelski 400 Krasnik 1,000” Lenk added: “Only old people, unfit for labor, women and children might be in- cluded by these evacuation operations , and such men who are not em- ployed at German positions. Craftsmen, however, might still remain here for the time being.” On May 13, 1942, the District Chief in Pu ł awy sent a letter to the Governor of the district of Lublin, which said under Point 5: 698 “In Opole the ghetto consists of Jews from Slovakia who were sent here a short time ago. All Slovakian Jews who are fit to work have for the most part already been procured for the ab ove named projects. Therefore, in the Opole ghetto there is merely a remnant of old and sick Jews who are not employable. ” On May 19, the District Chief of Lublin reported to the Subdepartment for Population and Welfare: 699 “On the questionnaire of the 12th of this month I recommended, when opportunity arises, that the following Jews be deported, whose evacuation is required first: Lubartów 2,737 Ostrow-City 3,062 Piaski 6,166    697 Ibid ., p. 54. 698 Faschismus – Getto – Massenmord , op. cit.

Later, the latter would then also be evacuated again in stages. A report of October 5, 1942, of the District Chief in Lublin to the Governor of the Lublin district sets out the following information regarding this: 701 “Reference: Dispositions of August 18, 1942, and September 28, 1942 With regard to the above dispositions I am reporting that since the first of January 1942, 8,009 Jews from th e Reich have been resettled into my district. 3,692 of these have already been resettled again. Expenditures or outlays have not been incurred due to these evacuations, the Piaski com- munity merely put 400 vehicles at their disposal without cost for the trans- portation of the sick, children, and baggage.” The 8,009 Jews mentioned were accommodated in the following locales according to this report: – 1,200 Jews from Germany in Be łż yce – 5,466 Jews from Germany in Piaski – 54 Jews from Germany in Luszawa – 652 Jews from Germany in Kamionka – 125 Jews from Slovakia in Firlej – 512 Jews from Slovakia in Ostrow Lub. The German policy of resettlement of the Jews was also echoed in the German press. On October 17, 1942, an article appeared in the Lemberger Zei- tung with the headline “ The first Jew-free city in the GG ” (GG = General Gouvernement), in which the following was written: 702 “Lublin is the first city in the General Gouvernement, which has be- come Jew-free, and the process now begins of liberating the territories of the individual administrative districts from Jews, who were bringing the    700 Ibid ., p. 55. 701 Faschismus – Getto – Massenmord , op. cit.

In clearing up [their district] , the two districts of Biala Podlaska and Radzin have jointly se- lected one city as a Jewish living area, namely Miendzyrzec. Since this place lies in the territory of the admin istrative district of Radzin, however, Piala Podlaska no longer has any Jews. [...] In order to bring about order in the part of the country around Lubatow [Lubartów] , the District Chief of Lublin-Land decided upon the ghetto of Lubatow as the Jewish living area for the Jews of the communities of Ty smieniec, Uscimov, Firlej, Kamionka, Luszawa, Lucka, Samokleski, Tarlo, and Ostrow as a city including Niemce. All Jews of the communities named must leave the communities no longer than 24 hours after publication of this police order of the District Chief and set out for the Jewish living area of the city. The Jews who are found still outside of Lubatow after that period has elapsed are punished by death. The Jewish Council of the c ity of Lubatow is under obligation to accommodate, to register, and if necess ary provide room and board for the Jews moving to Lubatow from the above cited communities.” It is clear from this article that if an area was declared to be ‘Jew-free,’ this in no way needed to mean the exte rmination of the Jewish population con- cerned! 3.

Nearly half of the total – 106,626 Jews – were lodged in the ghettos of Theresienstadt and Litzmannstadt. Do the deportations into the eastern te rritories and the Lublin district con- stitute the prelude to a policy of exterm ination? The transport lists cited permit us to answer the question with an unequivocal NO. Even after the opening of the so-called eastern extermination camps, most of the transports were con- ducted particularly into the regions, in which there were Jewish residential set- tlements. For example, after the commencement of operations in Be łż ec, ap- proximately 30 transports arrived in such areas. In almost the same way, be- tween the opening of Sobibór and the arrival of the first transports in that camp (June 1, 1942), many were reaching these areas and a further six after this date. Furthermore, after the opening of Sobibór, at least 20 transports had as their destination locales situated farthe r to the east of it. And not only that: After Treblinka began operations on July 23, 1942, at least 15 transports were headed for zones located farther eastward. It is valid to suggest that the direct transports to Minsk arrived first in Warsaw and ran over the Siedlce- Czeremcha-Wolkowusk line, so that they were traveling past Treblinka at a distance of approximately 80 km (Siedlce railway station) and about 140 km from Sobibór. What purpose could it really serve to let Jews destined for extermination travel for several hundred kilometers pa st two ‘extermination camps’? And if these camps actually possessed the incredib le killing capacity, which the offi- cial version of history attributes to them, why in the world, then, did dozens and dozens of transports take doomed Jews and have them settled in the dis- trict of Lublin instead of taking them directly into this camp? 4.

The corresponding transports came from France and Slovakia. 708 On September 16, 1942, Martin Luther , Director of the German Depart- ment in the Foreign Ministry, sent a tele gram to the German embassy in Brati- slava (Preßburg), in which he said that “ in the process of taking the measures for the final solution of the European Jewish problem ” the Reich government was prepared to immediately send to the east “ 20,000 young strong Slovakian Jews ,” where there existed “ need for deployment of labor .” 709 The Slovakian government accepted the German proposal “ with eagerness ,” 710 and the prepa- rations for the deportations could begi n. The program for deporting the Jews was decided upon on March 13, 1942, and provided for the dispatching of 10 trains each to Auschwitz and Lubl in according to the following scheme: 711 N O .

On April 29, 1942, the German embassy in Bratislava (Pressburg) sent the Slovakian government a verbal note containing the following: “The Jews who have been transported out and those yet to be trans- ported out of the territory of Slovakia into Reich territory will be coming into the General Gouvernement and into the occupied eastern territories after preparation and retraining for work assignment. The accommoda- tion, feeding, clothing, and retraining of the Jews, including their relatives, is incurring expenses, which cannot pres ently be covered from the initially small labor output of the Jews, b ecause the retraining bears results only after some time and because only a portion of the Jews, who have been and who are going to be transported, is capable of working.” In order to cover these expenses, the Reich government required a sum of 500 Reichsmark per person of the Slovakian government. 713 On May 11, 1942, SS- Hauptsturmführer Dieter Wisliceny, Eichmann‘s Deputy in Slovakia, informed the Slovakian Minister of the Interior that, ac- cording to information from the RSHA, there was a possibility of intensifying the transports of Slovakian Jews to Auschwitz, but he qualified this with: 714 “However, these transports are allowed to contain only Jews and Jew- esses who are fit for labor, no children.” The proposal was not adopted, and for this reason all 19 Jewish transports from Slovakia in May 1942 went into the Lublin district. A total of 57,752 Jews in 57 transports were deported from Slovakia in the year 1942. Of these, 38 transports, or a total of 39,006 pe rsons, were brought to the Lublin district, 715 the 19 remaining transports comprising 18,746 per- sons were sent to Auschwitz. The first transports of Jews from France are also to be viewed as being within the framework of this program for the exploitation of the Jewish work force, since the first transports were comprised exclusively of Jews able to work. Already in March 1942, SS- Hauptsturmführer Theodor Dannecker, rep- resentative for Jewish affairs in France, reported that preparatory talks “ with regard to the expulsion of approx. 5,000 Jews to the east ” could be conducted with the French authorities. Dannecker made clear that those involved would have to be “ male Jews able to work, not over 55 years of age .” 716 The mass deportation of the Jews living in France, but also of those in Holland and Bel-   712 Riešenie... , op. cit.

At that time, the Germans were conduct- ing first and foremost a policy of the exploitation of the Jewish labor force in Auschwitz, so that the problem of those who were unfit for work was only a peripheral one. On June 15, 1942, Dann ecker wrote a note, in which he sum- marized the results of a talk conducted on the 11th of that month in Depart- ment IV B 4 of the RSHA: 717 “For military reasons, an expulsion of Jews from Germany into the eastern deportation area can no lo nger take place during the summer. RFSS [Reichsführer SS = Himmler] has therefore ordered that greater numbers of Jews will be transferred either from the southeastern (Ruma- nia) or from the western occupied reg ions to the KL Auschwitz for the pur- pose of performing work. The basic condition is that the Jews (of both sexes) are to be between 16 and 40 years of age. 10% of the Jews sent along can be unfit for labor.” On June 22, 1942, Eichmann wrote a letter to the embassy counselor Rademacher on the topic “ Labor assignment of Jews from France, Belgium, and the Netherlands ,” in which he explained: 718 “For the time being, it is planned to initially deport to the Auschwitz camp approximately 40,000 Jews from the occupied French regions, 40,000 Jews from the Netherlands, and 10,000 Jews from Belgium in spe- cial trains running daily with 1,000 p ersons each, from mid-July or the be- ginning of August of this year.” The search for persons to deport, according to Eichmann‘s instructions to Rademacher, should be restricted first of all “ to Jews fit for labor .” On July 26, 1942, SS- Hauptsturmführer Dannecker wrote a circular deal- ing with “ Guidelines for the Evacuation of Jews .” The deportations were sup- posed to be restricted to “ Jews able to work of both sexes from 16 to 45 years of age .” Under Point 21 the Guidelines prescribe the following: 719 “The following must be taken along by each person: a) 1 pair of sturdy work boots, 2 pairs of socks, 2 shirts, 2 pair of un- derpants, 1 work suit, 2 wool blankets, 2 sets of bedding (pillow cases and sheets), 1 bowl, 1 drinking cup, 1 spoon and 1 sweater, and also the toilet articles necessary. b) Each Jew has to take a food supply with him for a 3-day march. Only 1 piece of baggage is allowed to be ta ken along (1 suitcase or backpack).” Under Points 6 and 7 are the instructions: “A food supply for a total of 14 days (bread, flour, barley, beans etc. in bags) is to be added to the transport in a special freight car.

This Jew is to also bring cleaning materials with him.” In July, discussions started about the problem of the deportation of chil- dren. On July 10, Dannecker inquired at the RSHA as to “whether the children of the Jews bei ng deported can be included in the deportation starting with perhaps the 10 th [720] transport.” 721 On July 21, 1942, Dannecker wrote in a note, which referred to a telephone discussion of the day before: 722 “The question of the deportation of children was discussed with SS- Sturmbannführer Eichmann. He decided that, as soon as transportation into the General Gouvernement is aga in possible, transports of children can get moving. SS-Obersturmführer Nowak promised to make about 6 transports possible to the General Gouvernement at the end of Au- gust/beginning of September, which can contain Jews of every kind (also Jews unfit for work and old Jews).” These six transports could not have had Auschwitz as a destination, for first of all Auschwitz was not located within the General Gouvernement but in the territory of the Reich (from the German point of view at that time), and secondly because during that period de portations to Auschwitz ran along a mountain route. The sentence “ as soon as transportation into the General Gouvernement is again possible ” can therefore not have referred to Ausch- witz. On August 13, 1942, SS- Sturmbannführer Günther sent a telegram to the SS authorities in charge in Paris on the subject of “ Transportation of Jews to Auschwitz.

Auschwitz as a Transit Camp for Western Jews On September 5, 1942, SS- Untersturmführer Horst Ahnert, member of the SIPO and of the SD in Paris, wrote a note on the “ Evacuation of Jews ,” which begins as follows: 726 “At the beginning of July 1942, the Reichssicherheitshauptamt ordered that, for the purpose of the final solution of the Jewish problem, the trans- portation of Jews out of the territories occupied by Germany for the goal of labor assignment should be begun on a greater scale.” On September 12, there was a meeting between Reich Minister Albert Speer, SS- Obergruppenführer Oswald Pohl, the Director of the SS-WVHA, and other functionaries. On the following day, Pohl handed a detailed report to Himmler. The discussion had concentrated on four points, the first of which was the “ Enlargement of the barracks-camp of Auschwitz as a result of the eastern migration. ” Pohl wrote on this point: 727    725 The transports allegedly taken completely into the gas before July 4, 1942, are a pure inven- tion.

We will skim off the labor force necessary for this purpose mainly in Auschwitz from the migration to the east, so that our existing company facilities are not disturbed in their output and their structure. The Jews destined for mi- gration to the east will therefore have to interrupt their journey and per- form armament work. ” With “ migration to the east ” the deportation of the Jews into the eastern territories was meant. In this context th e last sentence clearly means that the Jews who were not fit to work did not interrupt their journey, thus did not stop in Auschwitz, but continued onward. Where at least a portion of these people was sent emerges from a report, which SS- Untersturmführer Ahnert wrote about a meeting held on August 28, 1942, at the Department IV B 4 of the RSHA. This meeting was called in for the purpose of discussing the Jewish problem and in particular the evacuation of Jews in foreign occupied territo- ries as well as to address transportation problems. The evacuation of Jews to the east was supposed to take place via Auschwitz. In regard to the points dis- cussed, it said under point c): 728 “Inclusion of blankets, shoes, and ea ting utensils for the transport par- ticipants. It was demanded by the Kommandant of the internment camp Auschwitz that the necessary blankets, work shoes, and eating utensils are absolutely to be included in the transports. Insofar as this has not been done so far, they are immediately to be sent on to the camp.” Point e) related to the purchase of barracks: “SS-Obersturmbannführer Eichmann requested to immediately get on with the purchase of the barracks orde red by the Commander of the Secu- rity Police Den Haag. The camp is supposed to be set up in Russia. The transporting of the barracks can be handled so that in every train transport 3-5 barracks are carried along.” In the draft of an agreement between the Jewish Council of Slovakia and the SS-Sonderstab SS Führungshauptamt (SS special staff, SS administrative main office) about the exchange of Jews for various goods, the following re- quest of the Jewish Council is mentioned: 729 “No further deportations from th e General Gouvernement and Ausch- witz, 15 days after the conclusion of the agreement.” What could the deportation from Auschwitz mean if not the continuation of the migration to the east?    727 Pohl Report to Himmler of 16 September 1942 on the subject: a) Armament work . b) Bomb damage .

We received approximately 200 letters from D ę blin-Irena and Ko ń - skowala, Lublin district, where in addition to our Jews also Belgian Jews reside, who arrived there during the last weeks.” But all of the transports leaving from Belgium up to the end of March 1943 had been taken to Auschwitz, 731 so that the Belgian Jews to be found in D ę - blin-Irena 732 and Ko ń skowala – a village 6 km from Pu ł awy – by necessity had to have reached there from Auschwitz and, indeed, within the framework of the migration east previously described. Other Jews were deported to the ghe tto of Grodno (White Russia). They, too, had to have arrived there via Auschwitz. In a report entitled “ Warunki materialne bytu Ż ydów ” (Material living conditions of the Jews), which is from the second half of the year 1942, it says in regard to the ghetto of Lodz: 733 “There is a factor, which is causing the number of Jews to increase. This factor consists of the evacuati ons from the regions occupied by the Germans. Information about such evacua tions arrives in succession. It is known that 23,000 Jews from Berlin , Vienna, and Prague have been trans- ferred to Lodz; similar instances are also known in Warsaw; recently, a certain number of Jews was transf erred from Belgium to Grodno.” The documents just cited prove that a considerable portion of the Jewish population of western Europe (namely of France, Belgium, and the Nether- lands) were deported to the east since the second half of 1942, and, in fact, via Auschwitz, which served as a transit camp. The direct place of destination of these Jews was the General Gouvernement or Riga, from which the transports traveled farther on to the east. This policy was still is effect on May 5, 1943. On that day SS- Gruppen- führer Wilhelm Harster, Commander of th e Security Police and SD in Hol- land, wrote a note, in which he summa rized the orders from the RSHA for the following months: 734    730 Ibid ., Document 23 (outside of the text). 731 Serge Klarsfeld a nd Maxime Steinberg, Mémorial de la déportation des Juifs de Belgique , The Beate Klarsfeld Foundation, New York 1994, pp. 42-45. 732 Irena is a suburb of D ę blin. 733 Maria Tyszkowa, “ Eksterminacja Ż ydów w latach 1941-1943.

General lines: The RFSS desires that as many Jews as humanly possible be deported to the east in this year. 2.) The next trains to the east: Since a new synthetic rubber plant, which was destroyed in the west by air attacks, is supposed to be built in Auschwitz, above all a maximum number of Jews from the west is needed in the months of May and June. It was agreed that at first the Jews made available for transportation will be shipped, if possible already in the first half of the month, by means of merging several trains; the Westerbork Camp [in Holland] is therefore be- ing emptied quickly. The figure of 8,000 is the goal for the month of May. Train arrangements are being taken care of by the BdS, Den Haag, with the RSHA. 3.) The Hertogenbusch Camp: Since the RSHA requires a further 15,000 Jews in June, the point in time must be reached as quickly as po ssible, at which the inmates of the Hertogenbusch Camp [in Holland] can also be called upon.” A report produced at the beginning of 1944 and delivered to the Warsaw Delegation, thus to the representation of the government-in-exile residing in London, states with respect to the Jewish population of the General Gou- vernement in December 1943: 735 “According to information received, at the end of December there were approximately 150,000 Jews on Polish terr itory, in legal groupings, half of them foreign Jews.” Who could these “ foreign Jews ” on Polish territory be, if not western Jews processed into the General Gouvernement via Auschwitz? 6. Final Destination of Jews Deported to the East The deportations of Jews to the east therefore took place in two stages: the Jews were first temporarily settled or lodged in transit camps and then de- ported farther east. In view of the pauc ity of existing documentation, we can- not determine with certainty what the fi nal destination of this deportation was, but there exist various pieces of evidence, which make it possible for us to draw plausible conclusions. In the “ Guidelines for handling of the Jewish question ,” which go back to the summer of 1941, the following paragraph appears: 736 “The goal is a transfer into ghettos with simultaneous separation of the sexes. The existence of numerous more or less closed Jewish communities    735 Faschismus – Getto – Massenmord , op. cit. (note 290), p. 286. 736 PS-212.

For the rest, loca- tions are to be chosen for this, whic h, due to pending work projects, make possible the full utilization of the Jewish labor force.” On August 14, 1942, SS- Brigadeführer Otto Rasch, Leader of Einsatz- gruppe C, proposed to Berlin the following solution of the Jewish problem: 737 “The surplus Jewish masses can be expended and put to excellent use particularly in the cultivation of the great Pripjet marshes and the marshes on the northern Dnieper as well as on the Volga.” As already mentioned, 738 in a letter to Gauleiter Arthur Greiser on Septem- ber 18, 1941, Himmler wrote that, in accord with the wishes of the Führer , the Jews were supposed to be transported out of the Altreich and the Protectorate “ into the eastern territories newly inco rporated into the Reich two years ago ,” but merely “ as a first stage ,” in expectation of a deportation “ still farther to the east .” In a secret telegram of November 9, 1941, sent by Lohse to Rosenberg, it said with regard to Riga that the “Jewish camps must be shifted considerably farther to the east..” 739 On the same day, Dr. Leibbrandt reiterated in a telegram to the Reich- skommissar for the Ostland , Heinrich Lohse, that “ with regard to the trans- ports of Jews into the Ostland ”: 739 “Jews are coming farther eastward. Camps in Riga and Minsk are only temporary measures.” There is no reason of any kind to doubt that the indications of a program for renewed deportation of the Jews to th e east correspond to the truth. This is incidentally confirmed by an article of October 16, 1942, in the Israelitisches Wochenblatt für die Schweiz (Israelite Weekly for Switzerland). The paper re- ported: 740 “For some time there has been a trend toward dissolution of the ghettos in Poland. That was the case with Lubl in, then it was Warsaw’s turn. It is not known how far the plan has being carried out already. The former residents of the ghetto are going farther to the east into the occupied Rus- sian territory; Jews from Germany were brought into the ghetto to partly take their place. [...] an eyewitness, who was in Riga a short time ago and was able to flee, reports that 32,000 Jews are still in the ghetto of Riga now. Since the occupation, thousands of Jews have been killed.

Recently , transports of Jews from Belgium and other nations of western Europe were noted in Riga, which, however, immediately traveled on again toward unknown destinations. In the ghetto of Riga, so it is said, there were pogroms on the 30th of November and the 8th of December, to which a great many Jews fell victim.” On May 23, 1942, Karol Sidor, Representative of the Republic of Slovakia at the Holy See, handed a note to Secretary of State Luigi Maglione concern- ing the solution of the Jewish question. It was dated May 8th of the same year and was the answer to a letter of Nove mber 12, 1941, prepared by the Holy See, in which information on this subject was requested. After an explanation of the reasons for the delayed answer, the note continued: 741 “But in this period of time [742] there was a silence about the solution of the Jewish question. Long negotiations dealing with the solution to the Jewish problem in Europe took pla ce between the Slovakian and German governments, and the view was offered t hat the emigration of the Slovakian Jews represents only one component of a much larger overall program. In the near future, half a million Jews from [western and central] Europe will be sent to eastern Europe. Slovakia w ill be the first state whose Jewish in- habitants are taken by Germany. At th e same time, the emigration of Jews from France (the occupied part), Holland, Belgium, the Protectorate, and Reich territory is supposed to foll ow. Hungary has also expressed its de- sire to send off 800,000 Jews, as the head of government, Dr. Kállay, said in his speech on April 20 of this year. The Slovakian Jews are being accommodat ed at various locations in the area of Lublin, where they will defin itely remain. The Aryan population will be evacuated from these territories, and an exclusively Jewish district with its own administration will arise in its place, where the Jews can live as a community and can secure their existence by their own labor. The families will stay together.” In a speech in Bad Tölz, before SS-Junkers 743 on November 23, 1942, Himmler said: 744 “The Jewish question in Europe has also completely changed.

[...] ” 745 On December 16, 1943, in a speech in Weimar given before the command- ers of the Kriegsmarine (German navy), Himmler maintained that: 746 “Such and so many Jews were brought to the east. Movements of peo- ples, which we have distinguished by giving them great names in history, have been completed within this breakneck speed of development. [...] ” On July 29, 1942, the Papal Nuncio in France, Monsignore Valerio Valeri, wrote from Vichy to the Secretary of State, Cardinal Luigi Maglione: 747 “Around the twentieth of this month the occupation authorities in Paris, using the French police, arrested approximately 12,000 Jews. These were then for the most part tempor arily interned in Vélodrome [748] d’Hiver. The majority of these are non-Aryans of foreign origin, above all Poles, Czechs, etc., who are designated for deportation into the Ukraine.” On September 7, 1942, the “ Kommandeur no. 12 ” of the Einsatzkommando 12 of Einsatzgruppe D in Kislowodsk, Ukraine, issued the following order: 749 “To all Jews. For the purpose of settlement in the less populated re- gions of the Ukraine, all Jews who live in the city of Kislowodsk and those Jews who have no fixed residence are obliged to report on Wednesday, the 9th of September 1942, at 5 o’clock in the morning, Berlin time (6 o’clock according to Moscow time) to the freight train station. Each Jew is to take along a pack of 20 kg or under of food for 2 days. Additional food will be secured at th e stations by the German authorities. It is suggested that only the most necessary things be taken along: valu- ables, money, clothing, and blankets. Each family is to seal up its apart- ment, and on the key a slip of paper s hould be fastened, on which the first name, family name, the occupation, and the address of the family members are stated. This key with the slip of paper is to be handed over to the Ger- man detachment at the freight station.

Those families, in which one of the parents is a Jew but the other is a Russian, a Ukrainian, or member of another nationality, are not subject to evacuation. Furthermore, members of mixed blood are not subject to emigration. A voluntary emigration of the families of mixed blood, of Mestizos of groups I and II, is to be carried out at further opportunity. At the station, all Jews are to a rrange themselves into 45-50-man lines, in which individual families are to stay together.

In its issue Number 71 of April 1944, the Jewish underground paper Notre Voix had the following news to report: 751 “Thank you!

In this book, in which propaganda out- weighs the truth many times over, the allege d massacre is mentioned by a supposed eyewit- ness, the Jewish journalist Moissei Samoilowits ch Evenson, whose st atements are supposed to have been jotted down by another journa list, a Viktor Chklovski (I.

Later, thous ands of Jews from Essentuki were shot in the same trench. On July 10, 1943, it claimed, 6,300 bodies we re found there. (GARF, 7445-2- 93, pp. 31f.) But this sensational discovery had left behind no documentary traces, and the alleged mass murder is not mentioned in any of the Einsatzgruppen reports. In the standard work by Helmut Krausnick and Hans-Heinrich Wilhelm ( op. cit. , note 657), the name of the city of Kislowodsk surfaces only one time (p. 202) , and even there not in connection with a shooting of Jews. 751 Reproduced in: La presse antiraciste s ous l’occupation hitlérienne .

They were all in the Ukraine when the last Soviet offensive be- gan, and the SS bandits wanted to shoot them before they left the country. But since they knew what fate was in store for them and since they had learned that the Soviet troops were no longer far away, the deported Jews decided to escape. They were immediately welcomed by the Red Army and are presently all in the Soviet Union. The heroic Red Army has thus once again earned a claim on the gratitude of the Jewish community of France.” After the evacuation of the Jewish Council of Mielec, health cost arrears in the amount of 2,260.80 Zlotys resulted. On June 22, 1942, the State Sanato- rium and Nursing facility of Kobierzyn demanded this sum from the Chief of the district of Lublin. Inquiries were made, and on September 4, the SS- and Police Chief reported “that the Jewish Council was evacuated from Mielic to Russia.” The exact location, however, no one knew. 752 On May 13, 1942, the District Chief of Pu ł awy sent a report to the Gover- nor of the Lublin district, in which it was stated: 753 “In the period between May 6 to May 12 inclusive, 16,822 Jews were expelled from the Pu ł awy district across the Bug by the directive of the SS- and Police Chief.” According to official historiography , these Jews were deported to Sobibór and murdered there. The Sobibór camp was located some kilometers from the River Bug, which forms the border be tween Poland and the Ukraine. One could cross the Bug by the W ł odawa-Tamaszouka road (about 15 km north of the camp) as well as by rail (the Brest-Litovsk line). There is no valid reason why these Jews should not actually have been transported across the Bug, all the more so as Sobibór is not mentioned at all in this report. The destination of Sobibór was by no means a secret one, and it surfaces, for example, in the fol- lowing report of August 4, 1942, from the Chief of the Radom district: 754 “I am hereby reporting that 69 Jew s have been transported by a Son- derdienstkommando [Special Service Unit] from Rzczywol to the Sobibor Camp of the SS and Police Chief in the Lublin district.” If one considers the small number of deportees (69 persons), their place of origin (a location which was less than 80 km from Warsaw) as well as the fact that they had been mustered by a Special Service Unit, then this leads to the conclusion that they were skilled worker s who were supposed to be employed in Sobibór as camp personnel.    752 J.

In the concentration camp a plant for the repair of captured muni- tions is to be established.” This instruction, directed to offici als who could not have been unclear about the actual character of the Sobi bór camp, was a secret matter of the Reich: for what reason should Himmler have used the expression “ Durch- gangslager ” (transit camp)? In order to pull the wool over the eyes of his un- derlings – who knew all about it for a long time? In that period, deportations of Dutch Jews to Sobibór took place: on July 2, a transport with 2,397 persons arri ved, on July 9 another with 2,417. 756 That Sobibór had the function of a transit camp also emerges from the statements of several former Dutch-Jewish deportees: Cato Polak, deported on March 10, 1943 , remained in Sobibór one or two hours and was then transferred to Lublin with 30 women and 12 men. They re- turned home to Holland by way of Trawniki – Auschwitz – Bergen-Belsen – Theresienstadt. 757 Bertha Jansen-Ensel and Judith Eli azar, who had arrived in Sobibór on March 10, 1943, were likewise transferred to Lublin. Both returned to their homeland via Auschwitz. Although they had alluded to gas chambers and cremations, they declared: 758 “Sobibor was no camp, rather a transit camp.” Jules Schelvis, deported to Sobibór on June 1, 1943, was transferred to Trawniki three hours after his arrival there and returned to Holland via Ausch- witz. 759 Mirjam Penha-Blitz gave a statement that was summarized as follows: 760 “Deported by train from Westerbor k on March 10, 1943.

He returned home to the Ne therlands by way of Lublin-Majda- nek. 764 In a well-documented book, which was published in Dutch in 1993 and was later translated into German, Jules Schelvis writes that “ in Sobibor, after the arrival of transports, the fresh work forces for Dorohucza ” were “ se- lected .” 765 At Dorohucza, 5 km from Trawniki, was a labor camp where peat was cut. According to Schelvis, at le ast 700 Dutch Jews were transferred there directly after their arrival in Sobibór, but according to him only two of them are supposed to have survived the war. 765 There is certain knowledge of 171 of these persons – 147 men and 24 wome n – since they sent postcards home from Dorohucza. 766 Dorohucza was only one of many Jewish labor camps, which overlay the Lublin district like a dense network. Edward Dziadosz and Józef Marsza ł ek count no fewer than 110 of them. 767 As can be gathered from the statements summarized above of former deportees , other Dutch Jews were transferred from Sobibór to Lublin and then onward to such labor camps. Schelvis has documented a total of 89 postcards sent by Dutch Jews from Sobibór, 171 from Dorohucza, 52 from Lublin and 9 from Upper Silesia. 768 It also happened that a portion of the Je ws fit to work were sorted out from the rail cars before the train reached its final destination. This was the case for a transport that departed Vienna on Ju ne 14, 1942. After the train had arrived in Lublin, 51 Jews between 15 and 50 years of age had to get off; the remain- ing 949 continued their trip to the “ labor camp ” Sobibór, where it took an hour to unload the train.

Dutch, French, and Czech Jews reached Minsk. 770 The deportation of Polish Jews to White Russia were, according to C. Gerlach, “ extremely extensive ” 771 and they were “ taken to Minsk by railway ”. 772 7. Transfers into the District of Galicia A further portion of the Jews deported to the Lublin district were deported to Galicia. Some former French prisoners of war, who had been interned in the front line POW camp Stalag 325 at Rawa-Ruska (17 km from Be łż ec on the road to Lemberg/Lviv), were questioned by Belgian researcher Jean-Marie Boisdefeu. They claimed to have seen western, mainly French Jews in that zone. 773 As Boisdefeu stresses, declarations made by other prisoners of war in the year 1945 confirm this. Thus, a Paul Roser testified at Nuremberg. 774 “The Germans had transformed the area of Lemberg-Rawa Ruska into a giant ghetto.” A Dr. Guérin wrote: 775 “The province, situated in gloomiest Galicia, on the border of the Ukraine, had been transformed into a giant ghetto, in which Jews deported from the whole of occupied Europe were staying. They were guarded by brutal Ukrainians, who were in the pay of the Germans.” There was also a ghetto in Rawa-Rus ka, where 18,000 Jews were living in the summer of 1942. Of these, 14,000 we re allegedly murdered between De- cember 7, 1942, and January 10, 1943, and another 2,000 sent into the ‘death factory’ of Be łż ec. 776 It is not clear why this ghetto still existed several months after the opening of Be łż ec, which was all of 17 km away from it, and why the    770 C.

Hertz and Naftali Nacht report: 779 “All trains with Jews from Brussels, Paris, and Amsterdam go through Rava-Ruskaia. Transports from Tar nopol, Kolomi, Sambor, Brezany, and other cities in the West Ukraine came to them.” On July 22, 1941, east Galicia was incorporated into the General Gou- vernement; on August 1 of the same year , the district of Galicia was estab- lished. The massacres of Jews committed by Ukrainians and SS men in July 1941 in Lemberg and other Galician towns were to a great extent retaliations for the mass murders committed by the Soviets against Ukrainians before the retreat of the Red Army between June 22 and July 2, 1941. In fact, in the eyes of the SS and the civilian population, the ‘Soviet Jews’ were regarded as responsible for the Communist acts of violence or at least considered to be accomplices of the perpetrators. The reports of the Einsatzgruppen furnish detailed examples regarding this. Here are some typical examples: 780 “In Tarnopol 5,000 Ukrainians kidnap ped, 2,000 murdered. As counter measures arrest operation against Jewish intellectuals initiated, who shared responsibility for the murder and besides were informers for the NKVD. Number estimated at about 1,000. On July 5, approximately 70 Jews rounded up by Ukrainians and killed with multiple loads. Another 20 Jews killed on the road by military and Ukrainians, as response to the murder of three soldiers who were found chained in jail, with tongues cut out and eyes gouged out.” After the discovery of Soviet torture chambers, other Jews were shot as re- taliation measures. For example, after the discovery of the torture chamber in the courtroom of Tarnopol, the Germans reacted as follows: 781 “The troops passing through, who had the opportunity of seeing these atrocities and above all else the bodies of the murdered German soldiers, killed all of the approximately 600 Jews and set their houses on fire.” Even the massacre of (allegedly!) 33,771 Jews in Babi Yar at Kiev was represented as an act of punishment: 782    777 See lists in Notes 797f., pp. 266. 778 P.

Also, they are seen as the carriers and agents of the NKVD, who have brought terror down upon the Ukrainian people. As retaliation for the arsons in Kiev, all Jews were arrested, and on September 29 and 30, 33,771 Jews were executed in total.” In the entire district of Galicia in July 1941, approximately 10,000 and then up to December another 20,000 Jews are supposed to have been shot, but these figures are highly dubious. The claime d mass killings are in particular contradiction to the anti-Jewish meas ures of the civilian government of Galicia, which had replaced the military administration on August 1, 1941. Barely two weeks after the convening of the civilian government on Au- gust 14, 1941, units of the security police in Lemberg, Tarnopol, and Stanislau received an order from Colonel Worm with respect to the “ Jewish compulsory labor camps ,” which began as follows: 783 “In nearly each of the larger towns of the district of Galicia, prisoner of war camps are supposed to have been prepared by the Russians. They are supposed to be equipped with all n ecessary stock and are especially well suited for the establishment of Jewish compulsory labor camps. All existing camps are to be investigated and reporte d immediately. At the same time, the holding capacity and condition are to be determined.” On September 20, forced labor was in troduced in the entire district for Jews “ from the end of their 14th year to 60 .” 784 On November 6, 1941, proce- dures and deadlines were set for the establishment of a Jewish quarter in Lem- berg, whose administration was entrusted to a Jewish Council of Elders. This was obliged to establish, without delay, an office of nutrition, a security of- fice, a jurisdictional system, a health department, a welfare office, a burial system, a housing office, as well as a Jewish cemetery. 785 The first two ghettos were formed in November and December of 1941 in Tarnopol (approx. 18,000 Jews) and Stanis ł aw (about 30,000 Jews). 786 In January 1942, the Medical Bureau of the Jewish community in Lemberg was established.

As is well known, Be łż ec is supposed to have been an extermination camp established esp ecially for the Jews in this area. In a report of June 30, 1943, SS- Gruppenführer Fritz Katzmann stated that the “ evacuation from the district of Galicia ” had been in operation “ since April 1942 ” and explained: 790 “When the Senior SS- and Police Chief intervened once again with his police regulation of November 10, 1942 , concerning the formation of Jew- ish residential districts, 254,989 Jew s had already been evacuated or re- settled.” A few pages later he adds: “In the meantime, further evacuation was energetically pursued, so that effective of June 23, 1943, all Jewis h quarters could be dissolved. The dis- trict of Galicia is, therefore, free of Jews, aside from the Jews who are in the camps under control of the SS- and Police Chief. The occasional Jews who were picked up were specially treated by the respective Ordnungspo- lizei and Gendarmerie men. A total of 434,329 Jews had emigrated up to June 27, 1943.” At that point in time, there were still 21,156 Jews in 21 Jewish camps. 791 T. Sandkühler interprets the expression “ aus- bzw. umgesiedelt ” as code words for “ gassed or shot ,” 792 but this is completely untenable, because the designation used by Katzmann for those who were shot is “ sonderbehandelt ” (specially treated), just as in the sec tion cited above, as well as in the two fol- lowing: 793 “ [...] in the process, the whole bunch of Jewish shirkers and anti-social riff-raff was caught and specially treated. [...] These Jews, too, were dealt a special treatment.” On October 31, 1942, the “ government district north Einsatzkommando 5. Komp. Pol.

With respect to the other formulations: “ evacu- ated ” is not the same as “ resettled ” and the two designations do not have the same meaning as “ handed over to the SS-Sonderkommando .” Nonetheless the 1,023 ‘resettled’ Jews are regarded by orthodox historians as ‘gassed in Be ł - ż ec.’ 795 Finally, there is an indication that there was a ‘resettlement quarter’ in Rawa-Ruska even before a ‘Jewish reside ntial district’ was established in the local ghetto. The guidelines of the Jewish policy in the entire General Gouvernement were made known to the authorities of Lemberg by Brigadeführer Katzmann on August 6, 1942: 796 “Brigadeführer [Brigadier General] Katzmann announced that within half a year there will no longer be any Jews at large in the General Gou- vernement. The people are in part bei ng evacuated, in part are taken to camps. Occasional Jews living in the country are killed by the Einsatz- kommandos. Jews concentrated in the citi es are in part liquidated in large operations, partly evacuated, partly collected in labor camps.” These orders make a clear distinction between “ evacuated ” “ taken to camps ,” and “ killed ” in the one case as well as “ liquidated ,” “ evacuated ,” and “ collected into labor camps ” in the other case. In no instance would “ evacu- ated ” allow anyone to understand it as synonymous for “ killed ” or “ liqui- dated ”; the expression is therefore to be taken quite literally. It is unknown by what criteria the cl assification of the Jews into these three groups was performed and how large their respective percentages were, but it should be permissible to assume that the ‘Soviet Jews’ ( i.e. , Jews that moved to eastern Poland after its annexation by the Soviet Union in 1939) as well as those Jews who had committed anti-German acts or who were suspected of such, were supposed to be liquidated. On October 28, 1942, SS- Obergruppen- führer Friedrich Wilhelm Krüger, in his capacity as Senior SS- and Police Chief in the General Gouvernement and Secretary of State for the Security Services, issued a “ Police regulation concerning the formation of Jewish liv- ing quarters in the districts of Warsaw and Lublin ,” by which the establish- ment of 14 Jewish residential districts was prescribed. 797 Also included was    794 RGVA, 1323-2-292b, p. 29. 795 A.

His book bears the title The Displacement of Population in Eu- rope 800 and was published in 1943. In compiling his notes, the author made use of the assistance of 24 institutions that he lists painstakingly. 801 Each of these institutions had at its di sposal a dense network of channels of information in the various European na tions, so that Kulischer was able to base his work upon the best existing sources. In his book, he devotes a highly interesting section to the problem of the expulsion and evacuation of Jews by the German government, which is writte n with scientific exactitude and is un- dergirded by a copious documentation. For this reason, this book constitutes probably the most reliable information about what the enemies of Germany knew in 1943, despite all of the treacher ous atrocity propaganda concerning the NS Jewish policy. With rare preci sion, Kulischer explains above all the beginning phases of this policy: 802 “Until the outbreak of war, emigra tion was ostensibly encouraged; Chancellor Hitler said that he would willingly give a thousand mark note to every Jews who would leave. In practice, however, less humane and more effective methods of promoting Jewish emigration were adopted. Life in Germany was made impossible for Jews in order to induce them to    800 Eugene M.

At the same time, a moral obligation to receive the Jews was imposed on other nations. With the extension of German conquests, the aims of Germany’s Jewish policy were widened to embrace the ‘ liberation of all Europe from the Jew- ish yoke’. Not only the deportation and segregation of the Jews, but their extermination also was an openly proclaimed objective of German pol- icy. [803] But the main factor which change d the character of the anti-Jewish measures lay in the changed conditions themselves. With the progress of the war, emigration possibilities beca me more and more restricted. On the other hand, Germany was now able to send the Jews to non-German terri- tories under German control, so that as stimulated emigration declined, deportation increased. The Jews were either expelled to ‘purge’ a given country or city of its Jewish element, or they were concentrated in specific regions, cities or parts of cities to ‘purge’ the rest of the locality. It must be emphasised that the wholesale and recurrent removal of Jews is at the same time an effective method of securing their economic extermi- nation . No regard is had to their prospects of earning livelihood; on the contrary, the transfer is carried out in such a way as to make it impossible for the Jews to reorganise his economic life.” (Emphasis by the authors.) One of the methods for the realizati on of this economic extermination was the following: 804 “First they [the Jews] are sent to the General Gouvernment. Then the town in which they were settled is ‘purged’. In their new place of residence a ghetto is established. But even the ghetto does not give the Jews the secu- rity of a permanent residence, and they are again removed further east.” Kulischer then presents a little-known historical fact, which found its con- firmation decades later: “In many cases the immediate motive for expulsion or deportation was to make room for Germans. The first victims of expulsion on a grand scale were the Jews of the incorporated western Polish provinces, who were ex- pelled along with the Polish inhabitants, in both cases to make room for the ‘repatriated’ Germans. Later, Jew s were deported because, according the official statements, they owned a partments suitable for alien refugees from cities subject to air-raids.” In fact, Peter Witte has cited several examples of this German policy – ap- proved by Hitler himself. 805    803 Directly after this, Kulischer speaks of “ economic extermination ,” which proves that he does not mean physical liquidation but rather disempowerment when using the term “ extermina- tion ”. 804 Ibid. , p. 96. 805 Peter Witte, op. cit.

For example, for the period up to the end of December 1942, he assumes 120,000 Jewish deportees from the ter- ritory of the Reich 806 (compared to 100,516 given in the Korherr Report); for Austria he speaks of 40,000 806 (compared to 47,555 according to Korherr), for the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia of 50,000 to 60,000 806 (compared to 69,677 in Korherr) and of 62,444 for Slovakia 807 (compared to the Korherr figure of 56,691). Regarding France, Kulischer writes: 808 “In midsummer 1942 a drive against foreign Jewish refugees in Paris marked the beginning of mass deportati on from France to the ghettos and concentration camps of eastern Europe.” Regarding Belgium, he stresses: 809 “In the summer of 1942 deportatio n was resumed and from October onward it was on a larger scale. It may be estimated that up to December 1942 about 25,000 foreign Jews had been deported from Be lgium, partly to eastern Europe and partly to France for fortification building.” With respect to Rumania, he cites the Krakauer Zeitung (Krakow Times) of August 13, 1942: 810 “According to a German source, ‘185,000 Jews have been evacuated since October of last year (i.e. 1941) into Transnistria, where they were housed in large ghettos until an opportun ity arose for their removal further east. Today there still remain 272,409 Jews in the country... Both the prov- inces of Bessarabia and Bukovina can now be considered as free of Jews, excepting Czernowitz, where there are s till about 16,000... It may be as- sumed that even during the present year a further 80,000 Jews could be removed to the eastern territories’. Ho wever, according to later reports, the Rumanian Government announced in October 1942 that there would be no more ‘evacuations’ to Transnistria.” Kulischer subsequently devotes a section to the question of the “ Territories of Destination and Methods of Confinement .” He stresses in particular the ba- sic principle of the deportations of Jews: 811    806 Eugene Kulischer, op. cit. (note 800), p. 101. 807 Ibid ., p. 102. 808 Ibid . Kulischer overestimates the number of th e Jews deported from France up to the sum- mer of 1943 in that he speaks of 70,000, while the actual figure was approximately 54,000.

Many Western European Jews were reported to have been sent to the mines of Silesia. The great majority were sent to the General Government and, in ever growing numbers, to the east- ern area, that is, to the territories wh ich had been under Soviet rule since September 1939 and to the other occupied areas of the Soviet Union. Dur- ing the early period, deportation meant removal to the General Govern- ment, but since 1940 the deported Jews have tended more and more to be sent exclusively to ghettos and labour camps.” Kulischer then moves on to the ghettos: 812 “The first ghettos were set up in Lodz in the winter 1939-1940. Since spring 1940 they have been introduced in a number of cities and towns in the Warthegau and the General Govern ment. In the summer of 1940 the Germans segregated the district of Warsaw inhabited mainly by Jews un- der the pretext that it was a breeding- place of contagious diseases, and in the autumn of the same year a ghetto was formally established. All Jews living outside its confines were ordered to move into the ghetto and all Poles living inside to leave the ghetto area. Many Jews were also brought there from abroad. In the first ha lf of 1942 about 500,000 persons were crowded into the Warsaw ghetto. The growth of the ghettos is illustra ted by the following estimates. In November 1941 the Institute of Jewish Affairs estimated the number of Jews confined in the ghettos ‘at no less than 1,000,000’. In December 1941 figures released by Polish Jewish circles in London showed that about 1,300,000 Jews had been herded into el even ghettos in various parts of the country. For the early summer 1942 the In stitute of Jewish Affairs gave the number as 1,500,000. On October 28 and November 10, 1942, the Secre- tary of State for Security in the Ge neral Government issued regulations about Jewish ghettos in the five district s of the General Government (War- saw, Lublin, Krakow, Radom and Galice) , proving that from November 30, 1942, all General Government Jews must live in confined areas. Jews em- ployed in armament and other war industries and living in closed camps are exempted. The confined areas are of two kinds: ghettos inside the lar- ger towns, and purely Jewish towns, cleared of their non-Jewish popula- tion. In the whole of the General Government there are 13 ghettos, the largest being the Warsaw ghetto, and 42 Jewish towns. Since the invasion of the U.S.S.R ., ghettos have been established in western Bielorussia, western Ukraine and Baltic States, and also in occu- pied Russia.    812 Ibid ., pp. 107f."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 272 The primary purpose of the ghettos a nd special Jewish towns is the seg- regation of the local Jewish population. This consists of the former inhabi- tants of the area which was turned in to a ghetto or a Jewish town, the in- habitants of the same town who are removed to the ghetto, and Jews re- moved from other localities of the sa me country. For the second and third categories segregation in the ghetto meant compulsory removal, and for the third category forced migration also. The number of persons affected by this internal forced migration may have numbered many hundreds of thousands in the General Government alone. The ghettos of the General Government or the eastern territories are also the usual destination of the Jews deported from the west by the Ger- man authorities or by the authorities of other countries allied to Ger- many.” Finally, Kulischer comes to the subject of the compulsory labor camps. He notes in this regard: 813 “Up to the summer of 1941, at least 85 Jewish labour camps were known to exist in the General Governme nt. Of the 35 camps the position of which was known, two-thirds were located on the eastern frontier. Forced labour for Jews expanded rapidly, having developed from a subsidiary measure in an essential feat ure of the treatment of Jews. [...] During 1942, forced labour became th e common fate of the Jews in Po- land and German-occupied Soviet territory. The period for which Jews fit to work are liable for forced labour is no longer limited. Their removal to the east was largely motiv ated by the wish to make use of them as forced labour, and as Germany’s need of manpower grew, deportation for adults of working age was tantamount to assignment to forced labour. In contrast with the other inhabitants of German-occupied countries, Jews are not sent to work in the Reich, because Jewis h immigration would run counter the policy of making Germany ‘free of Jews’. The needs of the war economy are, of course, compelling the German authorities to deviate from this rule to some extent, and indeed so me exceptions have been reported. [814] But, generally speaking, deportation to the ea st is for the Jews the equivalent of the recruitment for work in the Reich to which the rest of the population of German-controlled Europe is subject, and their removal further and fur- ther eastward is doubtless connected with the need for supplying the army’s requirements near the front.” The author reckons the number of the “ deported and expelled and ... oth- erwise displaced ” Jews to be 3,150,000, but makes this more precise: 815    813 Ibid ., p. 110. 814 Kulischer gives as an example the deportati on of 200 Jews from the Ukrainian Poltava to Vienna. ibid ., p. 110, his note 1. 815 Ibid ., p. 113."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"Chapter VIII: Indirect Transports of Jews to the Eastern Territories 273 “This does not include: (a) the hundreds of thousands of Polish Jews deported eastward from the General Government, and (b) hundreds of thousands of Jews transferred by com pulsion within the limits of the same country or territory to be segregated in ghettos and special Jewish towns, in particular in the General Gove rnment and in the German-occupied Eastern Territories. Assuming that only a third of the resident Jews who remained in these territories were affected by (a) and (b), nearly 1,000,000 Jews must have been compulsorily remo ved eastward or from one town to another.” Nowhere does Kulischer speak of ‘extermination camps’ or of a German policy of the physical extermination of the Jews!"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":" 275 Chapter IX: Transit Camp Treblinka 1. Deportations of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto (1942) The facts and circumstantial evidence a ssembled so far lead to the conclu- sion that Treblinka was mainly a tran sit camp established for the Jewish popu- lation of the Warsaw district, which fits within the framework of National So- cialist policy of the resettlement of Jews to the east. The verifiable deporta- tions to Treblinka can be explained in this sense. Let us begin with those from the Warsaw Ghetto. According to the files of the Jewish Council of Warsaw, the following Jews were evacuated from the ghetto in the summer of 1942: 816 D ATE T RANSFERS D U L AG 817 U NFIT FOR WORK T OTAL 7/22/1942 6,250 17 22 6,289 7/23/1942 7,300 490 25 7,815 5/24/1942 7,400 0 44 7,444 7/25/1942 7,350 130 50 7,530 7/26/1942 6,400 250 41 6,691 7/27/1942 6,320 130 74 6,524 7/28/1942 5,020 291 70 5,381 7/29/1942 5,480 225 17 5,722 7/30/1942 6,430 181 40 6,651 7/31/1942 6,756 98  6,854 8/1/1942 6,220 45  6,265 8/2/1942 6,276 49  6,325 8/3/1942 6,458 99  6,557 8/4/1942 6,568 140  6,708 8/5/1942 6,623 160  6,783 8/6/1942 10,085 1,369  11,454 8/7/1942 10,672 154  10,826 8/8/1942 7,304 351  7,655 8/9/1942 6,292 1,920  8,212 8/10/1942 2,158 1,531  3,689 8/11/1942 7,725 452  8,177    816 “ Likwidacja Ż ydowskiej Warszawy ,” op. cit.

Are these fig- ures reliable? First, we emphasize the enormous discrepancy between the number of those fit and those unfit for labor: the former were supposed to have com- prised 4.5%, the latter 95.5% of the de portees! Compared to this, on June 30, 1942, in the ghetto of Lodz, 68,896 Jews were employed, i.e. fit for work, 818 of a total population of 102,546 Jews, 819 therefore 67.2%! Railway documents dealing with the deportation of Jews from Warsaw are unfortunately extremely rare. For the period of interest to us only a single schedule exists relating to this. It wa s issued on August 3, 1942, by the Gen- eral Management of the Eastern Railway in Krakow and reads: “From August 6, 1942, until further notice, a special train with reset- lers is running from Warsaw Danz BF [Danzig railway station] to Treb- linka and running empty as follows [...] ” The departure of one train per day was scheduled: “ 1/.

Ln Kr 9086 / 11.30 / Treblinka – Ma ł kinia – War- saw Danz Bf ” with departure at 7:00 PM and arrival at 11:19 PM. 820 Moreover, Albert Ganzenmüller, Secretary of State in the Reichsverkehrs- ministerium (Ministry of Transport) and Deputy General Director of the Ger- man Reichsbahn (Imperial railway), made the following report to SS- Grup- penführer Wolff on July 28, 1942: 821 “Since July 22, a train with 5,000 Jews makes a daily trip from Warsaw to Treblinka via Ma ł kinia, in addition to a train with 5,000 Jews traveling twice a week from Przemysl to Belzec.” On August 13, Wolff responded: 822 “I have noted with especial pleasure your report that a train with 5,000 members of the Chosen People has already been running for 14 days to Treblinka every day, and we are thus i ndeed in a position to carry out this movement of population at an accelerated tempo.” On April 11, 1962, Wolff was confronted with this letter during question- ing as a witness at the preliminary inves tigations for the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial. Wolff made the following statement in reply to this: 823 “At the time I did not connect the notion of a mass extermination camp with the name of Treblinka. I assumed it was a Jewish reservation [sic] , as Himmler had explained it to me.” Incredibly, not a single German repor t concerning such a large-scale dis- placement of population has been prese rved. The only numerical information available to us comes from a terse excerpt from the Stroop Report: 247 “The first large resettlement action took place in the period from 22 July to 3 October 1942. In this action 310,322 Jews were removed.” This figure is definitely reliable a nd on the whole it corresponds to the ta- ble cited above, so that this may be taken to reflect actual numbers. It is also quite probable that most of the transports went to Treblinka. It also is clear from the few preserved train schedules that the trains were emptied at Treb- linka and returned to their departure point without passengers. Of course, none of this proves that the deportees were murdered in Treblinka. The “ Disclo- sures and Conditions for the Jewish Council ” of July 22, 1943, prescribed: 824 “All Jewish persons who live in Warsaw, of whatever age and sex, are to be resettled to the east.” Exempted from the resettlement were, among others: “ [...] all Jewish persons who, on the first day of the evacuation, are in one of the Jewish hospitals and unable to be discharged.

All valuables: gold, jewelry, money, etc., can be taken along. A food supply for 3 days should be brought along.” The announcement of the Jewish Council – likewise dated July 22, 1942 – contained the same instructions but began as follows: 825 “By order of the German authorities all Jewish persons who live in Warsaw, of whatever age and sex, are to be resettled to the east.” The instructions in regard to baggage contained the following warning: 826 “Baggage of more than 15 kg will be confiscated.” In an announcement of July 24, 1942, the Jewish Council proclaimed: 827 “As a result of incorrect information, which is circulating in the Jewish quarter of Warsaw in connection with the evacuation, the Jewish Council in Warsaw was given permission by the authorities to announce that the evacuation of the populace not productively active in the Jewish quarter of Warsaw will, in fact, occur.” On July 29, 1942, the Director of the Jewish Ordnungsdienst (law & order services) issued the following summons: 828 “I am hereby announcing that all p ersons, who will be resettled accord- ing to the instruction of the authorities, will voluntarily report for the jour- ney on the 29th, 30 th , and 31st of July of this year, will receive 3 kg of bread and 1 kg of jam. Place of assembly for distribution of the products – Stawikiplatz at the Wildstraße corner.” The German authorities were providing 180,000 kg of bread and 36,000 kg of jam for the volunteers. 829 Let us summarize: The Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto were supposed “ to be resettled to the east ”; sick persons in the hospitals who were “ unable to be discharged ” were exempt from the evacuation; every person ready for reset- tlement received 3 kg of bread and 1 kg of jam – all of this does not conform to a policy of extermination. It is worthwhile to quote what Eugene Kulischer wrote in this regard: 830 “For the Polish ghettos are not the la st stage in the forced eastward migration of the Jewish people.

Many of the deportees have been sent to the la- bour camps on the Russian front; others to work in the marshes of Pinsk, or to the ghettos of the Baltic countries, Bielorussia and Ukraine.” Kulischer even knew all about the fact that “on 22 July 1942, the Jewish Council of Warsaw received an order to prepare 6,000 persons to be sent away daily.” 831 In the months that followed, letters and post cards, which were addressed to their relatives by deported Jews, arrived in the Warsaw Ghetto from Bia ł y- stok, Pinsk, Bobruisk, Brzezc, Smolensk, Brest Litovsk, and Minsk. 832 The re- sistance organizations in the ghetto, who at that time were already peddling the atrocity stories of the steam chambers, were of course making fast and loose claims that these letters and cards were forgeries fabricated by the Ger- mans for the purpose of deceiving the Jew s. On December 4, 1942, this claim was put out in an announcement of the Jewish resistance organization. 833 And in an appeal of January 1943 by the Jewish resistance organization of the Warsaw Ghetto, it said: 834 “In the course of the last weeks, people of certain circles were spread- ing news about letters, which supposed ly came from Jews who were evacu- ated from Warsaw and who are now supposed to be in labor camps at Pinsk or Bobruisk.” The authors of the appeal were allegi ng that such news was being spread by people “ who are working for the Gestapo .” The official historiography later gave up this simple-minded ass ertion and has supported the thesis that the letters and post cards had been “ written under duress at Treblinka ,” 835 but not a single one of the self-described su rvivors of Treblinka has made claims of this kind. In fact, this informati on confirms – however fragmentarily – the picture drawn by E. Kulischer. On May 30, 1943, a transport was sent to Bobruisk with 960 Jews, who had been arrested in the Warsaw Ghetto. On July 28 of the same year, another transport of Jews from Warsaw arrived in Bobruisk; a portion of the deportees were sent on to Smolensk. 836 In the Informacja Bie żą ca no. 30 of August 17, 1942, is a reference to 2,000 “ skilled workers ” on a transport of August 1 from the Warsaw Ghetto to    831 Ibid ., p. 110, his note 2. 832 Mark Weber and Andrew Allen have already referred to this fact in their article “ Treblinka ,” op. cit.

Another transport with 2, 000 craftsmen departed for Malasze- wicz, 837 a town at the border to White Russia, about 12 km from Brest. The report of September 7, 1942, “ Liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto ” mentioned earlier confirmed: 838 “Two small transports with 4,000 pers ons were sent for labor at instal- lations important for the war in Brzesc and Malachowicze.” Finally, the arrival of at least one transport from the Warsaw Ghetto at a location east of Treblinka has been documented beyond any question. On 31 July 1942, the Reichskommissar for White Russia, Wilhelm Kube, sent a tele- gram to the Reichskommissar for the Ostland , Heinrich Lohse, in which he protested the dispatching of a transport of “ 1,000 Jews from Warsaw to work at Minsk ,” because this would lead to dange r of epidemics and an increase in partisan activity. 839 On August 5, 1942, Lohse responded in a letter with the subject “ Import of 1,000 Jews from Warsaw ,” in which he indicated that “the practical realization of the so lution of the Jewish problem is exclu- sively a matter for the police.” The responsibility “ for the orderly realization of the measures ,” was also that of the police, so that protests were not permissible. 840 Kube took up the problem anew in a letter written on August 17, 1942, to Lohse (again on the subject “ Import of 1,000 Jews from Warsaw ”) and re- quested further instructions, since he wished to make “ fundamental decisions concerning the taking in of further Je ws into White Russia as a police mat- ter .” 841 At least one Jewish transport “ with workers ” (P KR 9130) arrived in Treb- linka on August 25, 1942, from Mi ę dzyrzec Podlanski, 842 but there is no refer- ence that it was for the labor camp Treblinka I. Deportations of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto to ghettos of the Baltic countries Latvia and Lithuania find add itional confirmation in the deportation lists of Jewish transports already mentioned from Kaunas and Riga to Stutthof in the summer of 1944. These lists, although only fragmentarily preserved, in- clude the names of approximately 1,200 Polish Jews, among them 112 boys and girls of up to 15 years of age. Furthermore, sources already cited earlier mention the transfer of Jews from Polish ghettos to the Ukraine by way of Be łż ec at the end of March 1942. G.

Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the Stroop Report In his well-known report of May 16, 1943, about the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto, SS- Brigadeführer Jürgen Stroop emphasized: 844 “When the Reichsführer SS visited Warsaw in January 1943 he ordered the SS and Police Leader for the District of Warsaw to transfer to Lublin the armament factories and other en terprises of military importance which were installed within the Ghetto in cluding their personnel and machines.” According to Y. Arad, 6,000 Jews we re deported from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka between the 18th and the 22nd of January 1943. 845 In fact, Himmler had ordered SS- Obergruppenführer Krüger on January 9, 1943, to transfer 8,000 Jews from the Warsaw Ghe tto into the camps in the area around Lublin and to deport another 15,000 up to the 15th of February. 846 On Febru- ary 2, 1943, SS- Oberführer Ferdinand von Sammern, SS and Police Chief in the Warsaw district, sent a secret letter to Himmler, which he wrote in refer- ence to the firms in the Warsaw Ghetto: 847 “Not only the firm of Többen and Schulz & Co., but also all the rest, 8 firms altogether with approximately 20,000 Jewish workers, are being re- located into the concentration camp at Lublin.” According to the Stroop Report, the number of deported Jews amounted to 6,500. 844 On March 31, 1943, Dr. Max Horn, together with Odilo Globocnik, the Di- rector of the firm Ostindustrie GmbH (O sti), informed the Director of the Cen- tral Construction Office of Lublin-Majdanek: 848 “Due to the order of the Reichsfüh rer SS, for police reasons and in the interests of increasing the Jewish labor assignment, the important arma-   843 G.

The move will be to Poniatowa, Trawniki, and Lublin into build ings that are already there.” The Jews resisted a voluntary evacuation, and on April 19, Stroop ad- vanced into the ghetto with his troops, after which the armed struggle began. The Stroop Report is cited by official historiography as proof that Treb- linka was an extermination camp. For example, G. Reitlinger claims that “ 7,000 Jews had officially been killed in the ghetto and 7,000 ‘taken to T 2.’ ” 849 R. Hilberg picks up this number: 850 “Several thousand Jews had been buried in the debris, and 56,065 had surrendered. Seven thousand of the captured Jews were shot; another 7,000 were transported to the death camp at Treblinka, 15,000 were shipped to the concentration camp and killing center at Lublin, and the remainder were sent to labor camps.” Neither Reitlinger nor Hilberg give the sources for these figures. This turns out to be a teletype of May 24, 1943, in which Stroop reported: 851 “Of the total of 56,065 Jews registered, approximately 7,000 were wiped out as a result of the major action in the former Jewish quarter it- self. By transport to T. II, 6,929 Jew s were destroyed, so that in all 13,929 Jews were annihilated. Beyond the fi gure of 56,065, an estimated 5-6,000 Jews were destroyed by explosions and by fire.” This teletype is not contained in the Stroop Report, which bears the title “ There is no longer a Jewish residential district in Warsaw! ” and was pre- sented as document PS-1061 during the Nuremberg Trial. 852 The Stroop Re- port actually ends with a teletype of May 16, 1943. L. Poliakov and J. Wulf say in a footnote: 853 “Document PS-1061 also contains a copy of the Stroop Report with a report of the day from May 24, 1943 (see facsimile), which is missing from the original report.” The passage involved was cited at the Nuremberg Trial at the proceedings of December 14, 1945. 854 Stroop supplied three different versions about the fate of the 56,065 regis- tered Jews. We have already become fa miliar with the one contained in the teletype of May 24 and taken up by R. H ilberg. In the teletype of May 16 he reported: 855    849 G. Reitlinger, op. cit.

Yet it is obviously false that 56,065 Jews were “ proven killed ”! In a statement of February 24, 1946, made under oath, Stroop finally gave the following testimony: 856 “After the people were taken out of the ghetto, 50 to 60,000 in number, they were taken to the railroad statio n. The security police had absolute control over these people and had the transportation to Lublin under their [authority]. ” According to this, the 56,065 registered Jews were deported to Lublin. The Stroop Report raises still other problems. Its author presents statistics, in which two categories of Jews are name d: those killed and those ‘registered,’ but those killed also belong to the latter. From the 23rd of April, Stroop gives the total number of the Jews who were “ already evacuated or registered for relocation ”: 19,450. 857 In the following table we reproduce the figures of the Stroop Report, in which we separate the number of thos e killed from that of those ‘registered’ when they are given together, 858 so that the respective column lists only the Jews held alive. One arrives at the tota l number by adding to the total of the previous day the figures of the day afte r, for example (for the 24th and 25th of April) 25,500 + 1,964 + 27,464. The single exception is the numbers for the 23rd and 24th of April, since 19,450 + 1,990 = 21,440 and not 25,500, so that (25,500 – 21,440 =) 4,060 persons are missing. In the report of April 24, Stroop mentions also 1,814 Jews who were “ pulled out of bunkers ” and who had to be added to the “ 1,660 Jews [who] were seized for relocation ,” so that the total number missing is (4,060 – 1,814 =) 2,246. These Jews presumable belong to the 3,500 ‘registered’ on the previous day, as in the report for May 6, in which the 2,850 Jews “ registered for the relocation ” were included in the total number of the day before, 859 although Stroop reports a figure of 1,070 as the total number for the day.    856 PS-1061.

Insofar as Treblinka is concerned, this camp is abbreviated to “ T II ” four times in the Stroop Report. The first time it is mentioned is in the teletype of April 25. The relevant text, which we reproduce below, is often cited in the offi cial literature as proof that Treblinka is supposed to have been an extermination camp: 864 “Today’s action came to an end with almost every shock troop, in that huge fires broke out and thereby caused the Jews to leave their hiding places and bolt holes. There were 1,690 Jew s captured alive. According to the tales the Jews relate, there a re definitely paratroopers who were dropped and such bandits among them, who were supplied with weapons    860 IMT , Volume XXVI, on the page cited. 861 The text reads 203, but in another report, wh ich refers to the same day (p. 647), the figures given are for 150 shot, 80 killed in a bunker expl osion, so that a total of 230 Jews were killed. 862 The total number for April 22 and the previous day is not given. 863 The erroneous figure of 49,712 appears in the text. 864 PS-1061.

With the Jews who have been bagged today, in my opinion a very large part of the bandits and lowest elements of the ghetto have been captured. Due to the onset of darkness, their immediate liquida- tion was no longer carried out. I will try to get a train to T II for tomorrow, otherwise the liquidation will be carried out tomorrow.” One day after this, Stroop noted in his teletype: 865 “At present there are no more of the registered Jews in Warsaw. The prescribed transport to T II took place.” The next mention of Treblinka occurs in the teletype of May 12: 866 “The transports of Jews now leaving from here are being taken to T II for the first time today.” Finally, the teletype of May 13 read: 867 “Today 327 Jews were captured in a Wehrmacht operation. The Jews now captured are only led to T II.” The Stroop Report gives rise to three questions in this connection: 1. How many Jews were deported to ‘T II’? 2. Were the Jews deported to Treblinka gassed? 3. Where did the majority of the Jews from the ghetto go? We will now address the first of these questions. On April 25, 1943, a total of 1,990 Jews were taken prisoner, of whom 274 were shot. The shooting op- eration was interrupted by the onset of twilight. The transport to Treblinka thus was able to include merely the remaining (1,990 – 274 =) 1,660 persons. But this is the largest number of those deported to Treblinka in a single day. This is confirmed by the fact that on th e next day, 1,722 Jews were taken pris- oner, of whom 1,692 were killed, and th e total number for the 26th of April corresponds to that of April 25 plus those 1,722 Jews: 27,460 + 1,722 = 29,186. In the report of May 12, it says the Jewish transports leaving from Warsaw were conducted to “ T II for the first time ” on that day. It is not clear how this fits with the transport of April 25, which went to Treblinka as the first. How- ever that may be, it is clear from the teletype of May 13 that only the Jews captured daily were sent to Treblinka. According to the table above, on May 12, 1,709 Jews were taken prisoner. The maximum number of Jews deported to Treblinka during this period therefore amounts to (1,660 + 1,709 =) 3,369. It is thus not clear how Stroop arrived at a figure of 6,929 in his tele type of May 24. But more important is another problem: if these Jews were dest royed in ‘T II,’ then does this mean    865 Ibid ., p. 660. 866 Ibid ., p. 686. 867 Ibid ., p. 688."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 286 that Treblinka was a camp established fo r the purpose of killing people? In our view, the ‘liquidation’ there of a few thousand Jews, whom the SS classified as “ bandits and lowest elements of the ghetto ” proves neither that they were gassed, nor that Treblinka was operated as an ‘extermination camp.’ If one keeps in mind that the camp was only 80 km from Warsaw, then it would not be surprising if the SS had shot a few thousand people there whom they were unable or unwilling to execute in the c ity. But another problem arises. In the introduction to his report Stroop writes: 868 “During the major operation, Jews could be captured who already had been shifted to Lublin or Treblinka, broke out of there and returned to the ghetto supplied with weapons and munitions.” There is thus reason to doubt that the (according to Stroop) 6,929 Jews de- ported to Treblinka were all ‘annihila ted.’ One of these Jews, a Samuel Zyl- bersztajn, was in fact deported to Majdanek on April 30, 1943, from the al- leged extermination camp Treblinka as a member of a transport of 308 Jews. 869 The translated title of the re port of his experiences is “ The Memoirs of an Inmate of Ten Camps .” After the ‘extermination camp’ Treblinka, Zyl- bersztajn also survived the ‘extermination camp’ Majdanek and eight ‘ordi- nary’ concentration camps; he is thus liv ing proof of the fact that the Germans did not systematically exterminate their Jewish prisoners. Another 356 Jews were transferred from Treblinka to Majdanek on May 13, 1943. 870 The Jewish historians Tatiana Berenstein and Adam Rutkowski write in reference to this: 871 “Some of the transports from Warsaw reached Lublin by way of Treb- linka, where the selection of the deportees took place.” This fact is confirmed by some witn esses who were interrogated within the framework of the extradition proceedings against John Demjanjuk in the USA.

The verdict of the Jury Court of Düsseldorf determined, plainly and clearly, on September 3, 1965, that “coming from Treblinka, several thous and people are said to have ar- rived at other camps.” 873 In conclusion, we now turn to the question of to what location/s the major- ity of the deportees were sent. According to T. Berenstein and A. Rutkowski, 30,000 to 40,000 Jews were deported fro m the Warsaw Ghetto to Lublin, where several transports arrived by way of Treblinka, where a selection of those able to work had been conducted beforehand. 874 The Polish historian Zofia Leszczy ń ska writes that the Jews from Warsaw were distributed as fol- lows: 14,000 to Poniatowo, 6,000 to Trawniki, 800 to Budzyn, and 16,000 to Majdanek. 875 According to their chronology of the transports, which contain large data gaps, the following transports of Jews arrived in the Lublin- Majdanek camp from Warsaw:    873 A.

Deportations from the ghetto of Bia ł ystok and the Transit Camp Ma ł kinia The clearing out of the ghetto of Bia ł ystok was planned for the 16th of Au- gust 1943. The Jews in the ghetto put up a weak resistance, and on the 16th to the 20th of August there were clashes until the inhabitants were overpowered by the Germans. As to the fate of the Jews taken prisoner, the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust reports: 877 “The deportations from the ghetto began on August 18 and went on for three days, in the course of wh ich the greater part of Bia ł ystok’s Jews were deported. Some were sent to Treb linka, where they were murdered, and others to M AJDANEK , where they went through a Selektion . Those who were found fit were taken to the P ONIATOWA camp the Bli ż yn camp, or to A USCHWITZ . A train with 1,200 Bia ł ystok children aboard was sent to T HERESIENSTADT ; a month later, these children too ended up in Ausch- witz.” The author of this article, 878 however, does not cite the important argu- ments already brought to bear by G. Reitlinger. The latter writes: 879 “A chance survival of way-bills in th e Königsberg office of the German State Railways reveals the fact that five special trains left Bialystok for Treblinka between August 21st and 27 th, 1943. 266 wagons were sent. On such a journey, occupying normally two-and-a-half hours, a box-car would hold from eighty to a hundred Jews. Thus there was room for all 25,000 survivors.” According to Reitlinger, these 25,000 Jews were all ‘gassed.’ The source cited by him is the English translation of an article written by Z.

It is nonetheless certain that the Jews from the ghetto of Bia ł ystok were for the most part deported into the area of Lublin. According to T. Berenstein and A.

On the same day, at least one other transport arrived in Majdanek with approximately 2,000 Jews (men, women, and children). 886 Also, the transport with 1,200 children (originally in- tended for Palestine 887 ) between 6 and 12 years of age, which arrived in Theresienstadt on August 24, 888 traveled by way of Treblinka, which therefore served as a transit camp for these transports.    880 “ The Treblinka extermination camp ,” in: Central Commission for Investigation of German Crimes in Poland (ed.), German Crimes in Poland , Warsaw 1946, pp. 103f. 881 Cited in German in the text: “ ́Fahrplananordnung Nr. 290 ”. 882 The text erroneously has August 27.

Czech had written that the two transports arrived from the ghetto of Ciechanów. 892 These two transports are to be seen in the context of the Jewish transports from Kielbasin (called Lososna by th e Germans), which took place between November 9 and December 20, 1942. This is a site about 50 km northeast of Bia ł ystok on the road to Grodno. During the course of this operation, further transports are supposed to have been directed to Treblinka: one with 7,000 Jews on December 14, the last on the 20th of the same month. 893 Since the alleged ‘extermination camp’ Treblinka is supposed to have been in operation at that time, it makes no sense that these more than 3,500 Jews unfit for labor are supposed to have been dispatched for ‘gassing’ to the more than 500 km distant Auschwitz rather th an to nearby Treblinka. But if there were still further transports to Trebli nka, the conclusion is almost inescapable that those sent to Auschwitz arrived th ere by way of Treblinka also, as did those from the Bia ł ystok ghetto. 4. Treblinka: Gas Chambers or Delousing Chambers? If one assumes that Treblinka was a transit camp, then one can also inter- pret the description of the alleged exte rmination facilities by the witnesses. In    889 D. Czech, op. cit.

Pressac has put forth a very interesting hypothesis with regard to the supposed extermination camps. He wrote: 894 “Only one Polish witness, Stanis ł aw Kosak, [895] has described the con- struction of the extermination camp Belzec from November 1941. There were three barracks built next to one another: the first served as a waiting room for the Jews, in the second they bathed and in the third they were gassed in three rooms. Railway cars making a circuit on a narrow-gauge track took care of transporting the bodies to a pit located at the edge of the camp. Kosak adds that three ovens conn ected with the water supply system were installed in the gas chambers. In this homicidal installation two elements do not make sense: the baths (why should the deportees have been allowed to bathe before their gas- sing?) and the three ovens connected to water pipes (carbon monoxide of course was used for the killing). For Treblinka, the witnesses describe d in different words exactly the same sequence: entry into the undressi ng room, then into the bath, after that into a room for testing asphyxi ation gases, which was next to a fur- nace room, from whence the tracks led to a ‘cemetery.’ They mention the use of steam in the gas chambers. Th is ‘death-house’ has more bizarre as- pects than that of Belzec: bath, steam, and ovens, whose purpose cannot have been that of incinerating the b odies, since these of course were buried in the ‘cemetery.’ A report of Novem ber 1942, which was sent to London, confirms that the suffocation chambers consisted of three rooms 4 × 4 m in dimension with a heating room, where there was a boiler for the produc- tion of steam, which was then conducted into the three chambers. These contradictions prove that the statem ents of the witnesses have not been ‘ar- ranged,’ but rather correctly repres ent the words of the witnesses. Instead of starting with the assumption of a facility for killing people, the hypothesis will have to be accepted that from the end of 1941 until mid- 1942, three delousing facilities were es tablished in Belzec, Sobibór, and Treblinka. The fact that places were cho sen for this at a border, which had become obsolete, can be explained if one recalls the concepts of prophy- lactic hygiene and the battle against ty phus by means of killing the insects carrying it, the lice, and if one considers that the Germans had typhus more or less under control in their zone of occupation, but not in the con- quered Soviet territories. Thus, the pr ogram for the deportation of the Jews to the east, as decided upon at the Wannsee Conference of January 20, 1942, was adhered to by processing th e deportees through these three hy- giene facilities. That Belzec was est ablished prior to the Wannsee Confer-   894 J.-C. Pressac, “ Enquête... ,” op. cit.

In the second chapter we saw that according to the testimony of the witnesses the alleged extermination installations of Tr eblinka were camou- flaged as a ‘bath.’ This point merits a closer analysis. Rachel Auerbach mentions “ a whole list of instructions about bathing and disinfection, about what to do with money, jewels and documents. ” In some cases the new arrivals were actually handed receipts after they had deposited their valuables at the check-in counter. 896 She writes that the women were of- ten asked to take towels wi th them into the bathhouse, 897 and explains: 898 “ [...] this door led to the ‘bathing establishment.’ This was a gray- white building with all the accoutrements of a regular public bath in the inside: ‘cabins,’ plus a few chim neys protruding from the roof. [...] The floor sloped down to wide, hermetica lly sealed chutes facing the entrance gate. Real shower heads were set in the ceilings of the rooms, but they were not connected to any water pipe.” Later she says: 899 “ [...] in the early days the Jews were told as they undressed and turned in their money to keep 1 z ł oty in order to pay ‘for the bath.’ A Ukrainian guard would sit in a wooden hut at the entrance to the ‘Road to Heaven’ and collect the z ł otys.” The report of November 15, 1942, adds one further important piece of cir- cumstantial evidence: the boiler room for the production of steam, which makes total sense in a disinfection and de lousing facility, but which in an in- stallation for extermination has no func tion whatsoever. Steam was in fact one of the methods at that time for disinfecting and delousing. 900 The Silberschein Report completes the picture of the eviden ce: directly after their arrival, the deportees were informed they would be continuing their journey “ to work in the east .” In the verdict of the Düsseldorf Ju ry Court of 1965, it says that the Warsaw Jews were greeted with the following address: 901 “Attention Warsaw Jews! You are in transit camp here, from which further transport to a labor camp will occur.    896 A. Donat, op. cit.

Gold, money, foreign currency, and jewelry are to be surrendered in exchange for a receipt at the counter. They will be handed back again later, upon presentation of the receipt. All those arriving have to bath for bodily cleanliness before traveling on.” According to the mentioned report, the deportees were subdivided accord- ing to their professions after this address. In fact, the SS had established a bu- reau at the camp train station, “where every new arrival had to go and report his professional train- ing.” Then, continues the report of November 15, 1942, “the people were taken into the camp and at first only sent into the baths for disinfection. After the bath they were temporarily sent into the single cells. There they were supposed to wait until it was their turn.” The sketch enclosed with the Silberschein Report 902 shows a men’s camp, a children’s camp, and a women’s camp; the deportees would have gone there following their bath. The Informacja bie żą ca of August 17, 1942, claimed that in Treblinka “ the camp was at a strength of 40,000 Jews on August 5 ,” 903 which indicates internment of the deportees after the bath. It then says in the report that the Jews were sent “ into the gas- and oven- chambers ” and were killed there – but why, for Heaven’s sake, were they or- dered to bathe beforehand? The alleged extermination facility, as it is repre- sented in the sketch, is also otherwise revealing: the building consisted of a dressing room, a bathing room, a “ room for testing asphyxiation gases ,” as well as a furnace or oven room, from whence a railway track led to the ceme- tery. What purpose, then, did the ovens serve? On the other hand, was not the bathing room identical to the room for test- ing asphyxiation gases (why, actually, a ‘testing room’?) and therefore had to be a real bath, through which the deport ees walked before they were lodged in one of the three camps mentioned abov e? But the dressing room as well as the ovens are not compatible with the extermination thesis, and indeed even less so with the version accepted today, for on the one hand the doomed are sup- posed to have undressed in the open, and on the other hand no historian claims that there were crematoria in Treb linka. If one views the entire facilities within another context, a medical-hygie nic one, then the description works out to be a completely logical one. In a facility, which contains a dressing room and a bathing room, a furnace (or oven) room can contain nothing other than a delousing furnace, but then the adjacent room was definitely no “ room for testing asphyxiation gases ,” but a disinfection/hot-air chamber. (In this con-   902 See Document 3 in the Appendix. 903 See Chapter II."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 294 nection, it is worth mentioning that the supposed ‘extermination camp’ of Che ł mno was also equipped with a delousing furnace. 904 ) Such disinfection furnaces were produced by several firms, among them the Topf firm in Erfurt, which installe d two of them (with four hot-air cham- bers) in the central sauna in Birkenau, 905 as well as the firm of H. Kori in Ber- lin, which produced less well-built ovens. 906 One other firm, which produced hot air, steam, and steam/formalin delousing chambers, as well as other simi- lar installations, was the Ing. C. Kl obukowski & Co., located in Warsaw. 907 The description and enclosed drawing contained in the Silberschein Report are reminiscent of the plan of the provisional delousing facility of the K.G.L. Lublin. This facility had rooms for dressing and undressing, a boiler house (boiler room), a room with showers (bath), and a room for delousing (“ room for testing asphyxiation gases ”). G. Reitlinger writes that some children transferred in August 1943 from the ghetto of Bia ł ystok to Theresienstadt “had seen their parents lead away to a ‘bath-house’.” 908 Since these children were processed thr ough the transit camp Treblinka – the same was true for the other Jews, adults, and children who were trans- ferred to Lublin/Majdanek and other camps – this bathhouse was obviously a genuine bathhouse! The structure of the two alleged g assing installations, however, which has been accepted by official historiography , seems to have been more suited to serve as hydrocyanic delousing chambers . In both, the chambers have two doors on the two opposing sides of the room, so that there is a ‘clean’ and ‘un- clean’ side. In this connection, the mi ssion of Kurt Gerstein acquires an obvi- ous meaning. Gerstein was no expert in mass killings, but he was one in the field of disinfection, and indeed so well-qualified in such matters that in the foreword to his book on disinfection published by the Waffen-SS Hygiene In- stitute, the SS- Hauptsturmführer d. Res. Walter Dötzer expressed his gratitude to him: 909 “I should express my thanks to SS-Obersturmführer (F) Dipl.-Ing.

These had been designed by the “ District Administrator in Tarnopol. Dept. of Health ” and explained the type and danger of the epidemic and the necessity of combating its carriers: “ Without lice there is no typhus fever. Fight lice infestation! ” Then it warned: “A large part of the population, but most of all the Jews, is infested with lice!” The text of the placard closed with th e admonition to see a physician at the first sign of symptoms of the disease. 915 The resettlement to the east of the Jewish population of the General Gou- vernement, which had been living in the ghettos under difficult hygienic cir- cumstances, therefore required transit camps with bathing facilities, disinfec- tion, and delousing. 5. What was the Fate of the Deportees? The fate of the Jews deported to the east is one of those questions, for which there is hardly a sure answer due to the lack of documents.

Reitlinger speaks. 917 A Soviet source em- phasizes the following regarding this question: 918 “When Hitler invaded Poland in the year 1939, tens of thousands of Polish Jews fled to eastern Poland, from where they later reached the So- viet Union. Together with the population of the Ukraine and White Russia, these Jews were the first who were evac uated to the east. Since the authori- ties knew that the Jews were the most critically threatened portion of the populace, they made thousands of trains available for their evacuation. In Zhitomir 88% of the Jews left the city , even before the Nazis arrived there. Special effort was expended to save th e Jewish kolkhoze peasants; many of them were evacuated in the Crimea under circumstances, which permitted them to take along all their cattle, toge ther with farm implements. In an ar- ticle that appeared in 1942 in ‘Congress Weekly,’ a New York Zionist pa- per, the Palestinian Jew Solomon Itzhaki gave the grateful account of a Polish-Jewish journalist about his own evacuation. During a five or six week journey, food, clothing, and speci al help for children and the ill were made available by the Soviet government . According to this journalist, mil- lions of evacuees, Jews and non-Jews, were quickly accommodated after arrival at their destination, received a profitable job in the war industry, and were assigned to agricultural op erations. While a large number of Polish Jews performed splendid work in the Soviet war industry, the Pol- ish-Jewish youth attended the Sovie t schools by the thousands. Hundreds studied at the University of Leningrad – shifted to Saratov during the war – where they slept in dormitories provid ed by the government and were fed in special canteens. All ‘Yeshivas’ (Talmud seminaries) were moved from eastern Poland to central Asia at th e cost of the Soviet government. The refugee rabbis carried on their clerical activity, and Michail Kusevitski, master cantor of the Great Synago gue of Warsaw, went on a concert through the Soviet Union, in which he profoundly moved soldiers as well as civilians with his singing of ‘Kol Nidre,’ a solemn prayer for the Jewish Day of Atonement. The majority of the Jews evacuated from the zones oc- cupied by Germany went to Uzbekist an. Many other Jewish families were taken in by the autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of Bashkiria in the Urals.

Thousands of other Jews, among them many elderly people from Vitebsk, Kiev, and Riga, found employment in the factories and textile industries of the same region.” E. Kulischer reckons the number of the Jews who fled from the eastern Polish provinces into Soviet territories, which never came under German con- trol, at 500,000; to this are be adde d 30,000 Jews from the Baltic states and 1,100,000 Jews from the Soviet territories, which left before the Germans conquered these areas. 919 In an Italian study entitled “ The Jews in the USSR ,” one reads: 920 “The Baltic states, White Russia, an d the Ukraine su ffered especially severe losses. A certain number of ref ugees of the war period settled in central Asia, so that the present [1966] Jewish population of Uzbekistan consists of old Jewish inhabitants of Buchara and immigrants from the European territories. Others settled in various cities of the Urals as well as Siberia or were evacuated there. Of th e refugees, some returned to their former place of residence after the wa r, others stayed, which explains the large number of Jews in towns like Sverdlovsk and Cheliabinsk.” The Jewish journalist Louis Rapoport draws a decidedly more pessimistic picture; he writes: 921 “Of the approximately one million Polish Jews sent into the Urals and Siberia – the journey lasted four to six weeks and ran under horrific condi- tions – a fifth to a third died, according to a news sheet of the Joint Distri- bution Committee from the year 1943.” For the period from March to September 1946, “ when the homeward trek from the deep interior had only begun ,” G.

It is an impossibility to assign exact numbers to each of these categories, but the few examples cited here do provide a notion of how high the Jewish losses were, which were not the result of German killing measures. The official population statistics of the post-war period do not help us any further. First of all because they come from the Jewish and Stalinist side and thus were inevitably influenced by th e demands of ideology and propaganda, and secondly because they do not allow for substantial factors such as emigra- tion to other countries, assimilation, or the plain and simple desire of many Jews not to be registered as such. In 1984, an Italian Communist newspa per explained the reduction of the Jewish population in the Soviet Union, which had been reflected in the cen- suses of 1926, 1970, and 1976, as follows: 928 “The decrease of the Jewish populat ion in comparison with the year 1926 is in part the result of the Nazi policy of extermination, partly trace- able to the natural process of assim ilation in a country, which numbers more than a hundred different nationalities and where there is no impedi- ment to mixed marriage. The shrinking of the Jewish population in the decade 1970-1979 is the result of the same assimilation process (in the USSR citizens declare their nationality by their own choice by choosing one of the two nationalities of their parents), but also the emigration of those Jews who have gone abroad within the framework of the Soviet pol- icy, which favors the reuniting of fa milies separated by the most diverse sorts of circumstances.” Insofar as the first post-war census is concerned, that of 1959, citizens could declare their nationality without having to produce their ID, in which their nationality was officially regist ered. For this reason, numerous citizens preferred, for various reasons , to assume another nationality. 929 Together with the rest of the factors already given, this contributed to producing a distorted picture of the numerical strength of the Jews in the USSR.    928 Calendario del popolo , no. 468, July 1984, pp. 10247. 929 Gli Ebrei nell’USSR , Milan 1966, pp. 55f."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":" 301 Chapter X: Conclusion In 1987, Robert Faurisson wrote the following noteworthy lines: 930 “‘ Shoah ’-business will continue to pros per.

[...] Tour operators are beginning to calculate the profit they can derive from these places, at which there is in reality nothing to see but where, as a result, they will fill the void with ‘symbols.’ The less there is to see with your eyes, the more they will give you to see in your imagination. From t hat point of view, Treblinka is an ideal place. Everything there is symbo lic: the entrance to the camp, its boundaries, the railway line, the acces s ramp, the path to the ‘gas cham- bers,’ the ‘open air funeral pyres,’ and the sites of the ‘chambers’ and ‘fu- neral pyres.’” Yes, Treblinka is, in fact, the most fitting landmark for the ‘Holocaust,’ a mirage of a multi-million genocide in gas chambers, of which not the slightest documentary or material trace exists an d about which we would know nothing without the tales of a handful of ‘eyewitnesses’ – in sharp contrast to the real, irrefutable suffering of the Jewish people during the Second World War. It is not without pregnant symbolism that the most important Treblinka ‘eyewitness’ by far, Jankiel Wiernik, and the most prominent representative of all of the orthodox historiography about that camp, Yitzhak Arad, are blatant falsifiers. By means of a bold manipulation of the November 15, 1942, report produced by the resistance movement of the Warsaw Ghetto, Wiernik con- verted the embarrassing ‘steam chambers,’ which characterize the first phase of the Treblinka atrocity propaganda, into ‘gas chambers’ in 1944 and thereby laid the cornerstone for the legend of the ‘gas chambers of Treblinka,’ which were subsequently transmogrified by orthodox historiography into ‘estab- lished historical fact.’ But compared to this harsh judgment about the Jewish cabinet maker from the Warsaw Ghetto, we must come to an even harsher judgment about the Israeli Professor Arad, who is guilty of the gravest of all offenses against the commandments of sci entific ethics: the conscious falsifi- cation of source material.

In 1990, the Administration of the Auschwitz Museum withdrew the four million figure of Auschwitz victim s – which had never been accepted by western historians anyway – and replac ed it with one-and-a-half million; in 1994, Jean-Claude Pressac, celebrated by the media as the leading Auschwitz expert, reduced the number again drastically to 631,000 to 711,000. 931 For the present, the last retrenchment of the front in this ongoing retreat came in May of 2002, when one of the editors of Germany’s largest newsmagazine Der Spiegel , Fritjof Meyer, wrote in the geopolitical German magazine Osteuropa with reference to allegedly new research results that ‘only’ half a million died in Auschwitz, which is still an exaggeration by at least a factor of three. 932 An even more drastic revision was ach ieved for Majdanek: in 1944, a fig- ure of one-and-a-half million murdered had been given for that camp; in 1948, Polish historiography set the total number of victims at 360,000, but at the be- ginning of the nineties, the number was reduced to 230,000; 933 Raul Hilberg assumes in his standard work that only 50,000 Jewish prisoners were killed in Majdanek. 934 According to the laws of mathema tics and sound human reasoning, this massive reduction in the number of vi ctims for Auschwitz and Majdanek would had to have resulted in a corres ponding reduction in the total number of ‘Holocaust’ victims, but no: the mythical six million figure must be upheld at all cost!    931 Jean-Claude Pressac, Die Krematorien von Auschwitz , Piper Verlag, Munich/Zürich 1994, p. 202.

At the same time, the other ‘pure extermination camps’ Be łż ec, Sobibór, and Che ł mno, for which the evidentiary material presented is of similar ‘quality,’ would have to take their departure from real history along with Treblinka. That the official view of Treblinka increases respect for the Jewish people can be justly questioned, for one of the cornerstones of this picture is the slav- ish cooperation of the victims with their executioners. Does it really do credit to Jewish honor if their fathers and gra ndfathers marched into the gas cham- bers of Treblinka like a herd of sheep, without giving a thought to escaping or resisting? Can one feel respect for th e 1,000 Jewish workers of Treblinka, who – always according to the orthodox versi on of history – assisted the 30 to 40 SS people and 120 Ukrainians day after day in murdering many thousands of their co-religionists, never warned them of the fate awaiting them, and acted as loyal accomplices to their tormentors to the very end, in full awareness of their own impending death? The American revisionist Bradley R. Smith has commented upon the ap- pearance of the barber Abraham Bomba in Claude Lanzmann‘s film Shoa , in which Bomba describes how he cut the hair of 60 to 70 naked women in the 16 square meter large gas chamber of Treblinka. After Lanzmann had asked Bomba what he felt when he saw all th ese naked women for the first time, the barber replied: 935 “ I felt that accordingly I got to do what they ... [Germans] ... told me, to cut their hair. ” Smith says in response to this: “There you have in a nutshell how eyewitnesses to the gas chamber atrocities typically describe their behavior. They did whatever the Ger- mans or anyone else requested of them. [...] In the neighborhood where I grew up men who behaved like Bomba claims he behaved would have been spit on. In the upside-down world of Holocaust survivordom, however, the Abraham Bombas are seen as martyrs and even heroes.” Historians who are interested in fact s will not allow themselves to be de- terred by Bomba’s monstrous fantasies from pursuing the many still open questions of Treblinka. Above all, it is entirely unclear where the Jews de- ported to Treblinka ultimately wound up. That Treblinka served as a transit camp is proven, but for the most part we are still in the dark as to the details (the number of those resettled, their destinations, and their fate during the war and afterwards).

Considering all the witnesses, all these pictures, all the documents, how could all this be lies and forgeries? And how could anybody, who has his five senses together, believe that such a thing could be made up? Thou- sands of historians and other research ers, hundreds of prosecutors, judges, and jurors – are they all wrong? Or di d they all conspire in an incredible meeting of minds, a consensus of mind-reading?” These or similar questions will pop up in most peoples’ mind when they are confronted with revisionist theories for the first time. In fact, even most revisionists posed these questions at the be ginning of their journey that turned them from exterminationist Sauluses to revisionist Pauluses. Even I, as the editor of this series of revisionist books that I started several years ago, find myself doubting my own revisionist convictions once in a while. I find myself asking similar questions to those quoted above. But then I have the professional duty and intellect ual pleasure to edit another book writ- ten by fine revisionist scholars like the authors of the present book. I edited it in 2002 in the German language, and now, some 18 months later, a second time for the English language edition. Though this book was not specifically written to answer the above questions of Doubting Thomases, which we all are sometimes, and gladly so, it did have , once more, the effect on me to ask quite different questions, and I hope that the reader had a similar experience while going through this fine work: “How can anybody seriously believe that the Holocaust DID happen? Considering all the absurdities, impossibilities, contradictions, how could all these witness tales ever be belie ved? And how could anybody, who has his five senses together, believe that such a thing could have happened? Thousands of historians and other researchers, hundreds of prosecutors, judges, and jurors – have they all lost their minds? Or were they all so brainwashed by wartime propaganda or trem bling in fear of the Jews that they did not dare to rock the boat?” Of course, reading this book does not have to lead to such a reaction. Frit- jof Meyer, for example, reacted quite differently. For many years, he was a leading editor of Germany’s biggest weekly news magazine Der Spiegel , a dedicated left-wing medium that has always been, and still is promoting the orthodox version of the Holocaust with verve. Meyer can perhaps be de- scribed as one of Germany’s media experts on this topic. He is also a dedi- cated buyer and reader of all revisionist publications, as Castle Hill Pub-"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 306 lisher’s database indicates. Meyer attracted some attention in 2002, when he published an article in a small German geopolitical magazine, in which he re- duced the Auschwitz death toll considerably to ca. 500,000, based an a strange mixture of revisionist and exterminationist arguments. 932 Several weeks after the German version of the present books was sent to Meyer, he reacted with a short email, as always indicating that his statements were not for publication. I therefore will quote them only indirectly. I do this, because it is necessary to show: a) mainstream scholars do pay attention to revisionist research; b) they dare to get into an exchange with revisionists; c) they are not courageous enough to do it in the open. In his statement, Meyer says that it was time that finally somebody gath- ered all the information about a topic, which had been neglected for a long time, and he praises the industry, with which the two authors added interesting discoveries from Polish archives. He regrets, however, that in his eyes this book serves only to support the author’s dogma instead of balancing the pros and cons in an unbiased way. He then claims that the authors omitted every- thing that would not fit into their image of Treblinka. First of all, I would like to address the severe accusation that the authors would only confirm their own dogma. If Meyer would care to define what a dogma is, then he would have to admit th at the official version of Holocaust bears all the characteristics of a dogma: all dissenters are severely punished by the society in large and in many countries, particularly in Europe, even by the authorities by means of political show trials. The dissenting view presented in this volume is the opposite of the dogma: it is a challenge to the dogma. It is also wrong that the authors have ignored everything that contradicts their thesis. How can anybody claim that a book, which dedicates most of its pages to discussing the ‘orthodox,’ dogm atic version with most of its argu- ments, is omitting contradicting eviden ce? To be sure, no author is omnis- cient, hence no book is perfect. But in contrast to Meyer, who has never dis- cussed opposing arguments and publications in his papers, Mattogno and Graf made an honest attempt to cover all the material that there is. Let me now address some of the points Meyer raised. 1. Use of Euthanasia Staff during Operation Reinhardt In discussing the postulated murder of the Jews in the so-called Operation Reinhardt camps, of which Treblinka was the largest, historians of the status quo identify the technical and organizationa l origins of this mass murder as to be found in the program of euthanasia, which was enforced as of the begin- ning of World War Two – the killing of so-called ‘life not worthy of life,’ in other words, mentally and/or severel y physically disabled people. The reason for this assumption is the considerable overlap, i.e. , continuity of staff in both"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Epilogue 307 areas. 936 However, it seems to me a very dubious practice to attempt to con- strue this continuity as evidence for th e mass murder, since it may very well mean only that the leadership had wished to retain staff, which had previously proven loyal in one socially extremel y controversial operation, for a subse- quent, no less controversial purpose. Bu t whether this controversial purpose was the resettlement, ghettoization, or mass murder of the Jews, is still an open question. 937 There is, of course, an answer to this question, and it lies in the fate of many of the staff members involved in Operation Reinhardt after the eastern camps were closed. 938 Globocnik and the major part of his team of Operation Reinhardt were transferred to the Adria tic coast of northern Italy in late 1943. Globocnik became “ Höherer SS- und Polizeiführer in der Operationszone Adriatisches Küstenland ” (Higher SS and police leader in the operational zone Adriatic coast) under direct orders of the Chancellery of the Führer . 939 His staff was turned into a unit called “ R ” (probably for Reinhardt) engaged mainly in anti-partisan warfare, but to a minor degree also in the organization and deportation of It alian Jews to forced labor assignments in Germany. In this connection, a transit camp for th e deportation of Jews was established in Risiera di San Sabba. Liliana Picciotto-Fargion writes in the regard: 940 “The mechanism [of deportation] is not very different at the Adriatic coast: the prison of Coroneo di Triest e acted as a collection point for the deportations between December 1943 and March 1944 and was then re- placed by the collection and transit camp located in Risiera di San Sabba (Polizeihaftlager).” The author adds that one convoy of deportees from Italy included on aver- age 500-600 persons, 940 “while those coming from the Nazi operational zone Adriatic coast (Operationszone Adriatisches Küstenland) with ‘capital’ Trieste had on average only around 60-80 persons per convoy.” 23 such convoys with a total of 1,173 Jews departed from this zone, most of them with the destination of Auschwitz. 941    936 K.

The average would thus be 51, not 60-80."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf: Treblinka 308 There is no doubt that the camp at Risiera di San Sabba was not an ‘exter- mination camp,’ and it is also clear that the main activity of Globocnik‘s unit “ R ” was to fight partisans. Therefore, we have clear proof of deployment of the former staff of both euthanasia and Op eration Reinhardt in a task that had nothing to do with the extermination of Jews. Thus, the fact of partial continu- ity of the personnel employed in the euthanasia with that employed in the Op- eration Reinhardt does not permit the conclusion that Jews were summarily exterminated in the Operation Reinhardt camps. Moreover, Meyer‘s claim that not only the euthanasia staff was transferred, but also their methods and equipment (gassing with carbon monoxide), is simply wrong. There is no evidence that the method used for killings during the euthanasia program – mainly bottled carbon monoxide – was ever used during the alleged Holocaust. Here we find claims to all sorts of methods, ex- cept the one used during euthanasia, which had proven to be highly effective. Today, Meyer and his co-dogmatists claim that the exhaust of diesel engines was used to kill people in Treblinka and Be łż ec. Fritz Berg has shown in detail how absurd this claim is, indeed. 99 It is not only absurd because diesel exhaust gases hardly contain any carbon monoxide, but even more so because the Germans had an over-abundance of ex tremely poisonous devices available: hundred thousands of wood and coke g as generators, which were cheap and easy to operate and delivered a gas just as lethal as bottled carbon monoxide. Considering that some of the staff of Operation Reinhardt had knowledge about homicidal techniques from the euthanasia program, this lack of transfer of method is strong circumstantial evidence that the Operation Reinhardt did not mean the killing of people. 2. Archaeological Findings Meyer criticizes the alleged lack of discussion of archaeological findings, like the fact that still today the rain rinses bone fragments to the surface. Since archaeological findings are discussed in detail in Chapter III.2. of the present book, one wonders if Meyer really read this book thoroughly. Also, when talk- ing about archaeology, Meyer should first ask why the huge mass graves at- tested to by the witnesses were never found despite archaeological research. Bone fragments rinsed to the surface pr ove that people died in Treblinka and were buried, a fact that nobody denies, but such findings do not prove a mass murder with the methods and the order of magnitude claimed. Unless Meyer has established the amount and nature of bone fragments and the area, in which they can be found, his statement cannot be called an archaeological finding, but merely an unfounded claim."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Epilogue 309 3. Testimonies of SS Witnesse s and of Prof. Pfannenstiel Meyer criticizes the authors for dismissing the testimonies of SS personnel and of Prof. Pfannenstiel as mere tactical lies. It seems that Meyer needs to be straightened out here: If a forensic bl ood analysis shows that a defendant was drunk at the time of a car crash, one million witness statements and one mil- lion confessions of the defendant, altogether claiming that the defendant was, in fact, not drunk, cannot change the fact that he was drunk. Thus, if one hun- dred witnesses and one hundred confessions state that the moon is made of cheese or that 870,000 corpses can be burned within a few months without leaving traces and without fuel, both assertions being of a similar intellectual quality, then we have to conclude – in light of all the forensic evidence – that the witnesses and the defendants are wrong. Like it or not! Thus, unless Meyer proves that the factual claims of the witnesses were physically possible, we do not have to discuss whether such w itness statements are correct, only why they are in correct. To solve this question, Meyer does not contribute anything. In this context, I may add one point that is often forgotten today: When the German Army invaded the Soviet Uni on with the Christian Crosses of the Wehrmacht as their emblem, the population greeted them enthusiastically – and naively – as God’s own soldiers to liberate them from the devilish Soviet mass murderers. In secret reports, even the NKVD admitted that vast parts of the local population of many regions viewed the Germans as liberators from Stalinist oppression, that the Germans treated the local populace well and turned many of the younger people into dedicated National Socialists eagerly prepared to close collaboration with the Germans. 942 It can thus come as no surprise that the largest volunteer army that ever fought for a foreign nation was the army consisting of over one million young people mainly of east European descent that fought alongside the Wehrmacht, b ecause these young people saw the German war against the S oviet Union as a cause worthwhile to sacrifice their lives for. Howe ver, when the Germans started to retreat in 1943, it happened that parts of the local population, knowing what was awaiting them, tried to move west with the Ge rmans and were prevented from doing so only by drastic German measures. Af ter the Red Army reconquered those temporarily liberated territories, the Soviets conducted draconic purges against the local population with show trials against uncounted individuals for actual or alleged collaboration with the Germ ans. In some regions, where collabora- tion was very intensive, considerable pa rts of the population were deported to Siberia as a collective punishment, in par ticular in the Baltic states, the Cauca- sus region, and the Ukraine. 943 Not even former prisoners incarcerated in vari-   942 Cf.

The only way to prevent deportation to a Siberian labor camp – an almost certain death penalty – was to bend over backwards in conforming with Soviet demands to denounce the former German o ccupiers and to help in ‘creating’ evidence for actual or only alleged German atrocities and war crimes. It is more than likely that many of the ‘e yewitness’ accounts collected by Soviet Russian or Polish commissions have their origin in this hysterical atmosphere of post-war purges. A similar atmosphere was also preval ent in the areas occupied by Ameri- can and British troops, although not as inte nsive, and whereas this atmosphere subsided by the end 1940s/early 1950s in the West – only to be gradually sub- stituted with a hysterical ‘Holocaust’ atmosphere created by media and court room propaganda – it remained a permanent background theme in the com- munist East as a tool to denounce and destabilize the ‘revanchist,’ ‘fascist’ West, especially its clientele state W est Germany as NATO’s most crucial and also most vulnerable member during the Cold War. 944 4. Deportation Data Meyer claims that the Jewish Historical Institute ( Ż ydowski Institut His- toryczny) of Warsaw has precise data about the deportation of Jews to the Op- eration Reinhardt camps. This Institute published a Biuletyn (Bulletin), in which, among others, archival material of the alleged extermination of Jews was published. The first issue appeared in 1951. J. Graf and C. Mattogno ex- amined all issues of this Bulletin in search for archival material useful for their research on Majdanek and on the eastern ca mps, above all in their search for deportation lists. Carlo Mattogno asserted that the Bulletin does not contain a single such list, nor can any list be fou nd in this Institute’s archive. Articles published in the Bulletin, which are important in the context of this topic, are listed in the bibliography of this book. Not even the book Faschismus-Getto- Massenmord , 290 which was published by the same Institute and which contains the better part of the documentation preser ved in its archives, contains any de- portation lists. While in Moscow, J. Graf and C. Mattogno verified the sources of the article by Tatiana Berenstein “ Exterminacja ludno ś ci ż ydowskiej w dys- trikcie Galicja ”. 786 It turned out that this artic le is based entirely upon testimo- nies. This confirms that the archive of said Institute does not contain any de- portation lists to the eastern camps.    944 To learn more about the circumstances, under which testimonies and c onfessions were made, cf. M. Köhler, “ The Value of Testimony and Confe ssions Concerning the Holocaust ,” in: G. Rudolf (ed.), op. cit. (note 81), pp. 85-131."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Epilogue 311 5. Conclusions Meyer lists a few other points, which I cannot address here because I sim- ply do either not know what he refers to or why he thinks certain arguments put forward by the authors are flawed. Meyer did not elaborate what he means by his criticism, but he has promised to publish his own paper on this topic and to inform us about it. So far, how ever, we have not heard back from him. It is encouraging that finally at least one scholar of the other side of this debate takes scientific standards seriously and takes notice of the need to ad- dress the many urgent questions raised by books like the present one. We can only hope for historiography in general th at this will not be an isolated case, but that other scholars will be encouraged by it to dare to voice their own doubts and opinions, because exactitude is the only certain way to the truth, and exactitude can only be achieved when we make each other aware of the mistakes we all make. To close this matter, I may point the reader’s attention to an article written by Prof. Dr. Robert Faurisson, which he penned after he read the German edi- tion of the present book: “ Treblinka: An Exceptional Guide .” 945 In it Dr. Fau- risson describes his own visit to Treblinka in 1988 and the interviews he made with two local witnesses. Since neither of these witnesses signed an affidavit nor any other record of their testimony seems to exist, and also because their testimony was made some 35 years after the fact, it was decided not to include Dr. Faurisson‘s hearsay report of eyewitness accounts in this book, because its evidentiary value is rather low. But th e interested reader might nevertheless enjoy reading what Dr. Faurisson e xperienced with those two witnesses.    945 R.

In 1993, Rudolf, a researcher from the prestigious German Max-Planck-Institute, published a thorough forensic study about the alleged gas chambers of Auschwitz which irons out the de fi ciencies and discrepancies of the Leuchter Report . The Rudolf Report is the fi rst English edition of this sensa- tional scienti fi c work. It analyzes all existing evidence on the Auschwitz gas chambers and exposes the fallacies of various failed attempts to refute Rudolf’s Report. The conclusions are quite clear: The alleged gas chambers of Auschwitz could not have existed.

Dissecting marshals the work of more than a dozen researchers to sub- ject the conventional historiography of the “gas chambers,” the “six million,” the postwar trials, etc. to careful, precise, methodical, and withering analysis. It analyzes how chemi- cal analysis weakens the case for gassing in Auschwitz; it determines the Auschwitz crematoria capacity; it shows how testimony was coerced; it points out technical absurdities of gassing claims in “gas vans,” Majdanek, Treblinka; it veveals photos forgeries in interprets reliable photo evidence; it assesses Jewish losses during WWII; and more. Dissecting ’s handsome design and format lend themselves well to the numerous illustrations, charts, and diagrams with which these leading revisionists advance the wealth of evidence the book offers against the Holocaust myth.

Of fi cially sanctioned Polish authors long maintained that in 1944, Stutthof was converted to an “auxiliary extermination camp” with the mission of carrying out the lurid, so-called “Final Solution to the Jewish Problem.” Now, Jürgen Graf and Carlo Mattogno have subjected this concept of Stutthoff to rigorous critical investigation based on Polish literature and documents from various archives. Their investigations lead to unambiguous conclusions about the camp which are radically dif- ferent from the of fi cial theses.

The critical reader might ask: what evidence does Hilberg provide to back his thesis that there was a German plan to exterminate Jews, to be carried out in the legendary gas chambers? And what evidence supports his estimate of 5.1 million Jewish victims? Jürgen Graf applies the methods of critical analysis to Hilberg’s evidence and examines the results in the light of Revisionist historiography. The results of Graf’s critical analysis are devastating for Hilberg. Graf’s Giant With Feet of Clay is the fi rst comprehensive and systematic examination of the leading spokesperson for the orthodox version of the Jewish fate during the Third Reich. 160 pp. pb, 6\"×9\", ill., bibl., index, $/€ 9.95-; £7.-"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"HOLOCAUST Handbooks, Vol. 5: Jürgen Graf, Carlo Mattogno Amazingly, little scienti fi c investigation had been directed toward the concentration camp Lublin-Majdanek in central Poland, even though orthodox Holocaust sources claimed that between fi fty thousand and over a million Jews were murdered there. The only information available from public libraries is thoroughly discredited Polish Communists propaganda. This glaring research gap has fi nally been fi lled. After exhaustive research of primary sources, Mattogno and Graf created a monumental study which expertly dissects and repudiates the myth of homicidal gas chambers at Majdanek. They also investigated the legendary mass executions of Jews in tank trenches (“ Operation Harvest Festival” ) critically and prove them groundless. The authors’ investigations lead to unambiguous conclusions about the camp which are radi- cally different from the of fi cial theses.

But do we really? The First Holocaust is an extremely irritating book, because it proves us all wrong. Supported with many publications from mainstream US media, in particular The New York Times , Don Heddesheimer provides the evidence to show that between 1916 and the late 1920s, mainly American Jewish organizations were claiming that up to six million Jews (!) would suffer terribly in poverty sticken Eastern Europe. In this context, it was claimed that eastern European Jewry would face a Holocaust if they did not receive massive aid. With such claims, millions of dollars were raised in the United States, which at the end were probably used to fi nance the Bolshevic revolution in Russia. This book is a key to understand the much more successful Holocaust propaganda which was unleashed during World War II. 144 pp. pb., 6\"×9\", ill., bibl., index, $/€9.95-/£7.- T h e F i r s t H o l o c a u s t"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"HOLOCAUST Handbooks, Vol. 9: (Summer 2004) Germar Rudolf, Jürgen Graf L e c t u r e s o n t h e H o l o c a u s t In 1992, German scholar Germar Rudolf held several lectures at various academic societies in Germany. His topic was very controversial: the Holocaust in the light of new forensic fi ndings. Even though Rudolf presented nothing short of full- fl edged Holocaust Revisionism to the mainstream audiences, his aguments fell on fertile soil, because they were presented in a very pedagogically sensi- tive and scholarly way. This book is an updated version of these lectures, enriched by contributions of Swiss scholar Jürgen Graf. The book’s style is unique: It is a dialogue between the two lecturers on the one hand who introduce the reader to the most important arguments and counter arguments of Holocaust Revisionism—backed up with sources and ref- erences to further reading—and the reactions of the audi- ence to these presentations on the other hand: supportive, skeptical, and also hostile comments, questions and assertions. It reads like a vivid and exciting real-life exchange between persons of various points of view, a compendium of Frequently Asked Questions on the Holocaust and its critical re-examination. There is no better way to introduce readers unfamiliar with revisionism to this highly contro- versial topic. ca. 400 pp. pb, 6\"×9\", ill., bibl., index, $/€25.-/£18.- HOLOCAUST Handbooks, Vol. 7: Arthur R.

Butz, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, was the fi rst (and so far the only) writer to treat the entire Holocaust complex from the Revisionist perspective, in a precise scienti fi c manner. This book exhibits the overwhelm- ing force of historical and logical arguments which Revision- ism had accumulated by the middle of the 70s. It was the fi rst book published in the US which won for Revisionism the academic dignity to which it is entitled. It continues to be a major revisionist reference work, frequently cited by prominent personalities. Because of its prestige, no library can forbear offering The Hoax of the Twentieth Century , and no historian of modern times can ignore it. A “must read” for every Revisionist and every newcomer to the issue who wants to thoroughly learn about revisionist arguments.

Although it cannot be denied that such terms do mean execution in numerous documents of the Third Reich, this does not mean that such terms always had that meaning. In this book, Carlo Mattogno has collected a large number of documents, in which such terms occur, and has put them into their proper historical context. Most of these documents were thus far unknown. Mattogno proves that these terms had a broad variety of meanings, all referring to normal aspects of daily life in the Auschwitz camp, but in no case referring to executions. Therefore, it turns out that the ‘deciphering’ of alleged camou fl age words applied by of fi cial historiography is untenable. ca. 160 pp. pb, 6\"×9\", ill., bibl., index, $/€15.-/£10.- Upcoming Holocaust Handbooks are: (working titles) Vol. 11: Richard Krege, The Krege Report.
