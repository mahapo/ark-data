It gives me a chance to correct some errors or omissions in the original, and to report major new work that has buttressed my original conclusions. First, the errors and omissions: Two are noted in the text as you come to them, one having to do with a controversy over the number and characteristics of empty shell casings found on the sixth floor of the Schoolbook Depository, and the second, a mistaken photo identity—the person in the photo is Roy Hargraves, not Frank Sturgis. These items are discussed in new Appendix C and new Appendix D. A new Appendix E discusses one of a category of critics (or rival authors) who reacted against Bloody Treason because it undercut their long-held theory that the Z-Film is authentic. A new Appendix F discusses startling new evidence of involvement of CIA’s National Photo Interpretation Center with President Lyndon Johnson in the alteration of the Zapruder film. A new Appendix G discusses Douglas P. Horne’s new book Inside the Assassination Records Review Board . Work by dedicated researchers on the JFK assassination will probably continue for the next hundred years, but as far as I know, virtually all new evidence in works that are supported by authentic documents or genuine scientific analysis has reinforced the basic conclusions in Bloody Treason . Among the most powerful comes from continued work by Dr. David Mantik about alterations of X-rays of President Kennedy’s skull and brain, and his important analysis of the autopsy, plus much more, reported in the book Murder in Dealey Plaza . [1] What I wrote in Bloody Treason about x-rays (assisted by Dr. Mantik and edited by him) has held up and been expanded by his continued work. There is no question that the X-rays were altered when in the hands of the executive branch of the U.S. Government. Another example of great progress in supporting my work about the Zapruder film (and my conclusion that it is a forgery) is Dr. John Costella’s work, reported in The Great Zapruder Film Hoax [2] Dr. Costella, like Dr. David Mantik, has a PhD in Physics. In brief, Costella concludes that the Z-Film was drastically altered by optically cutting and pasting, frame-by-frame (or groups of frames) on a new background of Dealey Plaza filmed either just before or just after the assassination. He essentially confirms all of my conclusions about frame removal, the impossible head turns of secret service agent Greer, the false spray of blood and eruption from the president’s head, and the strange lack of blur in frames in which blur should have been present. And, he discusses the mysterious blob on the president’s head that Dr. Rod Ryan had pointed out to me as having been painted by hand. Dr. Costella, with expertise in photographic blur analysis, also discusses other areas of the film showing forgery and much more. Included in this is an analysis of the sprocket holes in the film and the area between them, which he convincingly demonstrates is further evidence of a forgery. He concludes, as I did, that the hasty work of the conspirators was a desperately executed, botched job, done fast enough to keep up with the controlled releases in Life Magazine. But, nonetheless, with the help of others in government and elsewhere, the conspirators succeeded long enough for them to live and get away with the greatest political crime in all U.S. history. Dr. Costella, who lives in Australia, read my draft of the above statements and wrote back the following: “Noel’s words are kind, and at a high enough level that there are no details to possibly quarrel over—indeed, he clearly understands the big picture better than most.”"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"As the evidence grows into a mountain that the Z-Film is the result of massive forgery, the implications are undeniable: The drastic removal of frames, and cutting and pasting to create a new film was done at the direction of elements of the executive branch of the U.S. Government, and very likely involved key personnel in at least one major U.S. corporation. Haunting questions demand answers. How is it that, today, forty-six years later, we have not brought out one person who wittingly participated in the forgery and has talked about it? And, when we extend this reasoning further, many officials in our government must have known about it. This certainly includes Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover. Perhaps even more were aware. Why did none of them speak out? Was it because they were good soldiers taking orders from above, namely Johnson and Hoover? I think so. We do know that Johnson browbeat Earl Warren into the cover-up by using false national security reasons. Other new work about the autopsy by researchers has been very important. Prominent in this is reported by William Matson Law in his book The Eye of History ; notably his key interviews of FBI agents James W. Sibert and Francis X. O’Neill, both of whom witnessed the entire autopsy conducted at Bethesda Naval Hospital on the night of November 22, 1963. Mr. Law’s book has amplified what I wrote in Bloody Treason , and David Lifton’s truly heroic, pioneer work in his book, Best Evidence . The truth uncovered by these dedicated researchers is shocking, beyond belief, but it is the truth, supported by evidence gathered over the years. I was particularly gratified by the following statement on page 288 in Mr. Law’s book: After I returned home from Florida, I sent Mr. Sibert a copy of Noel Twyman’s book Bloody Treason (Laurel, 1997) (which, for me is the new cornerstone of the literature on the assassination) as a token of thanks for granting us the opportunity to interview him. Twyman’s book brings to the fore questions concerning the shipping casket versus the ornate display casket, body alteration, the forged X-ray and autopsy pictures, etc. Weeks later, I called Jim, or Si as I now think of him, to see how he liked the book: “You tell Noel Twyman for me that his book is the best thing I’ve ever read on the assassination.” James W. Sibert, it seems, is a True Believer. I have looked carefully at my conclusions in Chapter 32 written over twelve years ago about the JFK assassination. I have nothing to change now except that my cases about Lyndon Johnson and forgery of the Zapruder film have only gotten stronger. I will repeat here the opening words: The assassination of President Kennedy was about survival, power, and dangerous secrets. It was a backlash against the Kennedy brothers for what they were intent on accomplishing . The seeds of the plot to kill John Kennedy began to grow because he and his brother were determined to seize control of the power structure in the United States. ..... Does this give you pause about current events? It does me. As Joseph Conrad wrote in his classic novel, The Heart of Darkness : “And why not? The mind of man is capable of anything—because everything is in it, all the past as well as all the future...” Noel Twyman, January, 2010 "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell. ‘O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!

In other words, I state clearly up front where I am coming from and what I believe. This is not new: I want a man to begin with the conclusion....I look for good solid reasons from the start, which will instruct me in how to sustain their attack. Michel de Montaigne (1533—1592) A method of writing that I will employ is to start the book with a broad brush; that is, to give a picture as simplified as I can of the concept of the crime before plunging into the complexities that must follow. This method will be used for the book as a whole, and for each chapter. I believe the reader will appreciate that there is a constant struggle, in absorbing this vastly complicated material, to separate the forest from the trees. An account describing the forest alone is insufficient; an account that is believable needs trees. The truth of the Kennedy assassination cannot be explained just with broad concepts. It needs hard, scientific-forensic evidence, authentic documents, and reliable testimonies to establish proof of the basic allegations. The book has been designed so that the reader [3] can go along with me as I try to untangle—and, yes, possibly solve —the crime of the century. Whether I succeed or not remains to be seen. I found the writing to be an incredible adventure and a learning experience beyond my expectations. I trust that the reader will, at least in part, share these rewards with me. The book proceeds on many parallel tracks—sometimes maddening, sometimes confusing—but what I found to be necessary if I were to have any hope of achieving a complete picture. The first part, Prelude , develops an hypothesis based on superficial evidence—looking at the obvious “big picture” plus what was widely available to the interested public within about ten months after the president was murdered. [4] The second part, Murder and Cover-Up , develops key forensic-scientific evidence, including the medical evidence and key testimonies that are related. The third part, Gangsters, Cops, and Spies , develops evidence concerning organized crime, the Dallas police, the CIA, and military intelligence. The fourth part, Right-Wing Extremists and Power Politics , develops evidence concerning the military-industrial complex, right-wing extremists in the United States and abroad, Eastern European immigrants, and anti-Castro Cuban exiles. The fifth part, Conspiracy and Cover-Up in Washington, D.C ., develops evidence concerning the Secret Service, J. Edgar Hoover, and Lyndon Johnson. The final chapter is a summing-up and presents a theory of the assassination based on what I learned and discovered."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"PART 1: PRELUDE"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"1 INTRODUCTION There is no longer significant historical controversy as to the question of whether or not John F. Kennedy was assassinated by a conspiracy. That question has been settled as an official truth: Kennedy was assassinated by a conspiracy. This was confirmed by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in 1979 and is based on its simple conclusion that there were at least two gunmen. The scientific evidence available to the committee indicated that it is probable that more than one person was involved in the President’s murder. That fact compels acceptance. And it demands a reexamination of all that was thought to be true in the past. Further, the committee’s investigation of Oswald and Ruby showed a variety of relationships that may have matured into an assassination conspiracy. Neither Oswald nor Ruby turned out to be “loners,” as they had been painted in the 1964 investigation. Nevertheless, the committee frankly acknowledged that it was unable firmly to identify the other gunman or the nature and extent of the conspiracy. HSCA Report, p. 180 (Emphasis added) Not specifically confirmed by the HSCA, but later confirmed by its chief counsel, G. Robert Blakey, was that organized crime was part of the conspiracy. This conclusion was based, among other things, on the evidence that Jack Ruby stalked and killed Oswald and was connected to organized crime. The conclusions of the House Select Committee on Assassinations were summarized in Blakey’s book, Fatal Hour : On the question of conspiracy—that is, the involvement of others with Oswald—the evidence was also compelling. The Warren Commission and the FBI investigations of conspiracy were so seriously flawed that their conclusions of no evidence of conspiracy could not be given any weight. But most important, there was scientific evidence, as well as human testimony, of two gunmen shooting at the President in Dealey Plaza. The Committee was also aware that the most plausible explanation for the murder of Oswald by Jack Ruby within forty-eight hours of the assassination was to silence him, and it took into account the evidence of significant associations of both Oswald and Ruby with groups and individuals with strong motivation to assassinate the President. While it could not identify the other conspirators, the Committee voted to reverse the verdict of history. It found that President John F. Kennedy was killed as a result of a conspiracy. (Emphasis added) As the years have passed in writing this book, I have observed how almost everyone I know is not aware of this very important historical fact: The Congress of the United States actually did officially declare that John Kennedy was killed as a result of a conspiracy . What is going on here that not even our informed citizens are aware of this? Another fact of history that I found strangely not widely known is that Abraham Lincoln was not killed just by the half-mad actor John Wilkes Booth acting alone. Lincoln was killed as a result of a conspiracy that included Booth and other conspirators who, at the same time, came very close to killing Secretary of State William Seward. Four of the conspirators were publicly hanged for it. I don’t recall learning that in my history class in grammar school. How do we explain this phenomenon in the United States of either a lack of serious interest—or psychological denial—of the reality of conspiracy? An interesting question, considering that polls consistently show 80 to 90 percent of the American people do not believe the findings of the Warren Commission. Yet there is not a popular uprising demanding the truth. Why is this?"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Whatever the answer to that question, a diligent search for the truth in Kennedy’s assassination does prevail among a relatively few (several thousand) inquisitive souls in the United States and throughout the world. They want to know whether agencies or elected officials of the federal government were part of an assassination conspiracy. In particular, were the CIA and FBI involved? Was the Secret Service involved? Were the military medical doctors who performed the autopsy involved? Was Lyndon Johnson involved? Was there a larger conspiracy involving the military-industrial complex or right-wing extremists, even at an international level? Could it happen again? These are the questions that I will attempt to answer in depth, by taking my investigation well beyond that of the HSCA. In the case of the Kennedy assassination there was a complex web of motivations, human frailties, and sinister ambitions. At that unique period in American history we had a vice president of extraordinary ambition and ruthlessness who loathed the president and his brother. We had a fanatical, all-powerful director of the FBI who had held the position for thirty-five years and had allowed organized crime to grow to enormous power. And both the vice president and the director of the FBI had been severely compromised by organized crime. Added to this was right-wing extremism—anti-Communist paranoia and racial fears that had reached a peak of explosive intensity. And in 1963 there was a radical clique of people within the military and the CIA who had come to believe that they were the sole possessors of the truth. This group had become almost a cult, devoting their entire professional lives to fighting the evils of fascism and, later, communism. They had slowly transformed from people like you and me into people who believed that the ends justified the means—no matter how abhorrent. These people became partners and personal friends with the Mafia; they became partners with the worst Nazi war criminals; they became experts in bribery and deception; and they experimented in Manchurian Candidate (programmed assassin) techniques using LSD and other drugs, combined with hypnosis and psycho-electrical behavioral modification methods involving terminal experiments with unwitting subjects. (The Manchurian Candidate was the title of a best-selling novel by Richard Condon, about a Soviet-Chinese plot in which a remote-control assassin would be created at a brainwash center in Manchuria.) They kept secret psychological profiles on our presidents. They became masters of disinformation and propaganda, having penetrated virtually all of U.S. media with literally hundreds of CIA-paid agents or sympathizers—up to the level of top executives in such organizations as Time-Life, NBC, ABC, and CBS. And they had essentially unlimited funds to conduct research on assassination methods and schemes —they had developed the art of assassination to what they called a pure science. They had participated in or been instrumental in the assassination of foreign leaders, according to the Church Committee. The countries and leaders involved in which successful assassinations occurred were: (1) Congo (Zaire), Patrice Lumumba; (2) Dominican Republic, Rafael Trujillo; (3) Chile, General Rene Schneider; (4) South Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem. This is not necessarily a complete list, in that it does not include allegations of CIA complicity in political assassinations before 1960 or after 1970. [5] (See Chapter 21 for more on this subject.) In short, the CIA and military intelligence became a world unto itself, answerable to no one. After all, who better than they knew the truth about the way things worked in the real world? They had the knowledge. For over twenty years they had been given a free hand, all the money they needed, with few questions asked or rules applied. In their minds, they were the elite, and men of adventure and patriotism. And then a young millionaire playboy president came along and threatened their very existence."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Finally, the curious fact makes itself felt that in general people experience their present naively, as it were, without being above to form an estimate of its contents; they have first to put themselves at a distance from it— the present, that is to say, must have become the past— before it can yield points of vantage from which to judge the future. Sigmund Freud, The Future of an Illusion 2 POLITICAL CLIMATE IN 1963 It was not difficult for me to consider the possibility that John Kennedy was assassinated by a conspiratorial group. But I soon found it very difficult to deal with what I discovered when looking at the depth and horror of the conspiracy. It became apparent that it involved many people and was incredibly bizarre. In short, it was unbelievable. How could one begin to deal with this? To gain perspective I went back to examine 1963 and compare what I thought was going on in the United States, at that time, with what we now know was going on. In 1963, I did not know that the Kennedy brothers and the CIA were in partnership with the Mafia [6] in a plan to assassinate Fidel Castro. In fact, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), predecessor of the CIA, as it is now known, started a partnership as far back as World War II and had a long-term relationship with Mafia chieftains such as Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky to do the CIA’s dirty work. This partnership had developed to a point where, in many respects, organized crime and the CIA were almost indistinguishable—criminals, drug traffickers, and murderers—partners in crime yielding enormous profit to many of those involved. This alliance had grown to encompass a cult of retired military officers, all of whom had the common enemy—communism—as a facade to conceal what I will argue were their true motivations—greed and lust for power. These were secrets unknown to the American public; this gave the Mafia a stranglehold on the CIA and key officials in government. Even by today’s standards, it is shocking to realize that in 1963 (and prior to that time) the president of the United States was carrying on sexual affairs with women ranging from the famous, emotionally unstable movie actress Marilyn Monroe; to Ellen Rometsch, a lovely young refugee from East Germany whom the FBI suspected of being a spy; to Mary Pinchot Meyer, sister-in-law of his friend Ben Bradlee and wife of Cord Meyer in Washington, D.C.; to Judith Campbell Exner, who was at the same time seeing Mafia chieftain Sam Giancana in Chicago. The JFK affair with Exner was documented in dozens of telephone calls to the White House and by the Senate Select Intelligence Committee in 1975. While carrying on the affair with John Kennedy, Exner was acting as a courier between him and Giancana, allegedly delivering money for political payoffs in the 1960 presidential election. The gravity of the affair was compounded when Robert Kennedy also had an affair with Marilyn Monroe, after she had been dropped by the president. Can you imagine if President Clinton and Vice President Gore were doing these things today? Mary Meyer kept a secret diary about her affair with John Kennedy; she would be mysteriously murdered a few months after his assassination. President Kennedy’s affair with Marilyn Monroe culminated in what would certainly have been an unprecedented scandal had the truth become known. It ended when Marilyn Monroe either committed suicide or was murdered, [7] just hours after she was visited by the president’s brother, Robert. I also did not know that the director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, was hiding behind a facade of moral integrity and patriotism when in reality he had been corrupted with financial favors from the Mafia, and was a closet homosexual, which the Mafia knew about. And I did not know that Vice President Lyndon Johnson had also been corrupted, not only by organized crime, but also by involvement in large-scale criminal activities in Texas with master con man Billie Sol Estes, and in other criminal activities with his"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"protégé and aide, Bobby Baker, in Washington, D.C. and elsewhere. [8] And while all this was going on, Robert Kennedy was on a vendetta to destroy organized crime. He had stepped up prosecution to an unprecedented level. [9] Under fire were Jimmy Hoffa, president of the Teamsters Union and partner with the Mafia; Carlos Marcello, Mafia chieftain in New Orleans; and Sam Giancana, Mafia chieftain in Chicago. Talk of assassinating President Kennedy was spreading. If the Kennedys were to succeed in destroying the Mafia, they unwittingly would destroy a worldwide apparatus of criminals, interlocking spy agencies, and businessmen whose power and scope defy the imagination. It helps me to keep a perspective if I reflect back to 1963 on the extreme hatred, jealousy, awe, and fear that John Kennedy instilled in the right wing of U.S. politics at that time. He was an electric personality who incited the complete range of human instincts. Kennedy appeared invincible with a 59 percent approval rating in the polls. The economy was in great shape. The national budget was balanced. In the eyes of most Americans, Kennedy had just faced down Nikita Khrushchev in the Cuban missile crisis. There appeared to be no doubt that he was going to be re-elected by a landslide. With the exception of a rising animosity in the south, and a hate campaign by a few right-wing extremists, he was riding high with the American people and was a worldwide hero. He was adulated and had achieved dazzling celebrity status. But it was little known that he was in deep conflict with the CIA and the military regarding the fight against communism, the Vietnam War, and arms procurement. After presiding over a debacle in the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, which many believed led to the Cuban missile crisis, and after taking the nation to the brink of nuclear war in his handling of that crisis, Kennedy was seriously seeking a way to withdraw from Vietnam, to make peace with the Soviet Union, and to greatly reduce the power of the CIA. He had fired Allen Dulles (head of the CIA) and his top two men, General Charles Cabell (brother of the mayor of Dallas) and Richard Bissell; and he had stripped of power the head of CIA assassination operations, William Harvey. Plans had also been formulated to remove Lyndon Johnson from the ticket in 1964 and, after the election, to retire J. Edgar Hoover; both of these men would then become powerless to defend themselves when their personal secrets and collusion with organized crime were revealed. From the point of view of John Kennedy’s enemies, they could easily rationalize him as a traitor, a political crook, a coward, a hypocrite, a hedonist, and a disgrace to the office. Those who were threatened by the Kennedys feared that a Kennedy dynasty would pass the office on to the family for generations. Nobody like John and Robert Kennedy had ever come along; they were seen as recklessly pursuing personal goals in the guise of righting all wrongs and correcting all evil, while intent on destroying their opponents— and likely to succeed if not stopped by whatever means necessary. In his short three years in office, John Kennedy, along with Robert, had made more enemies than possibly any other president in the history of the United States (with the exception of Abraham Lincoln). The Kennedy brothers, as a dual entity, were young, ruthless, cavalier, and naive in believing that they could accomplish anything they set out to do and have anything they wanted. Tragically, they had gravely underestimated the strength and potential for the violent reaction of their enemies. What they did not know was that all of the elements had fallen into place to bring together a realistic plan to assassinate the young president and cover up the crime. A lethal backlash against the Kennedys was set to occur on a sunny November afternoon in Dallas, Texas."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"President Kennedy speaking to a crowd in Fort Worth in the early morning of November 22, 1963, a few hours before he was assassinated. Behind him is John Connally. On his right is Senator Ralph Yarborough. On his left is Lyndon Johnson, who would become president in a few hours. According to Johnson’s mistress, Madeleine Brown, the vice president told her on the night before the assassination that after tomorrow, the “‘blankety-blank’ Kennedys would never embarrass him again.” She said, “I met him in Austin on New Year’s Eve and I was real concerned about it because everyone in Dallas was talking about he was responsible for the assassination. So I said to him, ‘Lyndon,’ I said, ‘you have already told me that after that day, the Kennedys [will never] embarrass you again.’ And again, Jack Ruby had come out openly and said that Lyndon Johnson was the cause of it. So I said, ‘In my mind, I’ve got to put things to rest.’ “‘And he had a temper fit. He blew up and he just screamed and hollered.

This was just after Kennedy had fired Dulles and replaced him with McCone as director of the CIA. Dulles has been scrutinized closely by assassination researchers as a prime suspect in the JFK assassination, but virtually no credible evidence of his complicity has been found. However, there is no doubt that he concealed evidence from the Warren Commission on CIA involvement in Mafia-CIA plots to assassinate Fidel Castro. Judge Burt W. Griffin, who was a counsel to the Warren Commission, wrote that Allen Dulles was the only member of the Commission who might possibly be suspected of deliberately participating in a cover- up. [10] But it seems safe to say that Dulles had the knowledge to mastermind the assassination. He also had long-time friends in the military-industrial complex and the Defense Intelligence Agency, as well as loyal followers in the CIA, many of whom were very angry with JFK.

French —An unexpected stroke of policy; a bold seizure of government, executed suddenly and often accompanied by violence; literally, stroke of state. Britannica World Language Dictionary Conspiracy—the secret agreement among several people; joint activities against someone or something in order to obtain certain, definite political goals. Dictionary of the Russian Language, S.V. 3 DALLAS, TEXAS—NOVEMBER 23, 1963 To get a broad picture of the crime—and the evidence that became available soon after—I decided to write a concise summary of the tragic event and the aftermath. [11] This, I felt, would be a good starting point and would also be revealing in looking at the crime in its essential simplicity: perhaps the answer was more obvious from the beginning than one would think. Using the Warren Commission Report that had become available within about ten months after the assassination, and referring to news media reports during that period, I picked out what I thought were the most salient points that could lead to an understanding of the crime, as follows: John Kennedy was shot when several shots rang out while he was riding in an open limousine on Elm Street at Dealey Plaza at 12:30 p.m. He was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital and pronounced dead at 1:00 p.m. Some of the shots appeared to come from a rifleman on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building at Dealey Plaza. Many witnesses also observed and smelled gun smoke and heard gun shots coming from behind a wooden picket fence on a grassy knoll along Elm Street. All of the shots occurred in a time frame of about six seconds. The entire sequence of the shooting was filmed in almost perfect fidelity by an amateur photographer, businessman Abraham Zapruder. The Secret Service took possession of the film within a few hours after the assassination. Riding in the same limousine, in front of John Kennedy, was Texas Governor John Connally. He was severely wounded in the gunfire but miraculously survived. About one half hour before the shooting, railroad signalman Lee Bowers, working in a watch tower in the parking lot to the west of the School Book Depository, saw two cars drive into the area and park in a restricted area behind the picket fence on the grassy knoll; one of the men in the cars was talking into a hand-held microphone. A third car entered the area only a few minutes before the shooting. The railroad signalman saw two men standing near the picket fence just before the shots were heard. As the gunfire erupted he saw a flash of light or smoke at the spot where the two men were standing. Only one and one-half minutes after the shooting, a Dallas police officer found Lee Harvey Oswald on the second floor of the building. Oswald was immediately identified as an employee by the manager of the building and was let go. Within fifteen minutes after the shooting, a description of a suspect was broadcast over police radio that roughly resembled Oswald. No one knows how the description was obtained. A few minutes after the shooting, about a block from the School Book Depository, a Nash Rambler station wagon picked up a man who was seen in a window on the sixth floor just before the shooting, and who was then seen leaving the rear of the building just after the shooting. The same station wagon circled the block and came back to the front of the building where it picked up another man running down from the grassy knoll. About ten or twenty minutes after the shooting, the Dallas police cordoned off the School Book Depository building. Inside, on the sixth floor, they found a rifle and three spent shell cartridges. But hard evidence would soon show that more than three shots had been fired. At about 1:50 p.m., Oswald was captured by the Dallas police in the Texas Movie Theater. The"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"police testified that there was a struggle with him and that he pulled out a revolver and attempted to shoot. Miraculously, the gun misfired. They confiscated the revolver which would soon be identified as having been purchased by Oswald using the alias A. J. Hidell. About thirty-five minutes before his arrest, Oswald was allegedly stopped on foot on East Tenth Street in nearby Oak Cliff by Dallas police motor patrolman J. D. Tippit. Oswald allegedly shot and killed Tippit at about 1:15 p.m. and then proceeded on foot to the Texas Movie Theater. Oswald was obviously a man on the run. Upon initial examination of the president, Parkland Hospital doctors announced that Kennedy had been hit by a bullet with an entry wound in the front of his throat. The next day a photograph was published in a Dallas newspaper showing a man picking up a bullet slug found in the grass to the rear and left of where the presidential car was at the time of the shooting. This bullet was given to a civilian, presumably an FBI agent, and has never been seen since. This evidence of shots from the front or side was compelling proof that Oswald could not have acted alone and therefore that there was a conspiracy. Sometime between 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m., a bullet was found on a stretcher in the basement of Parkland Hospital. It was in almost perfect condition, with no measurable loss of weight and only slightly deformed. This bullet would later be alleged by the Warren Commission to have wounded Connally in three places and shattered his rib and wrist bone. It was never proven that the bullet was found on Connally’s stretcher, but it was traced back to the rifle found on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. Upon being captured, Oswald was taken to the Dallas police station and questioned intermittently over several hours by the Dallas police and the FBI. No notes taken at the time of the interrogation are known to be in evidence. During the custody of Oswald on the first day, newsmen were given a brief access to him when he was taken before cameras and microphones after he was charged. He appeared composed and managed an occasional smile as he insisted in a low voice that he was innocent in the death of Kennedy. Earlier he had said, “I did not kill the President. I did not kill anyone.” He acted surprised that he was being accused of being Kennedy’s assassin and muttered that there was a plot against him. He asked to be put in touch with a prominent New York attorney who had leftist leanings. On November 24, Oswald was shot and killed by Jack Ruby, who was a Dallas nightclub owner and commonly known associate of organized criminals. Oswald’s murder occurred while he was being transferred from the Dallas police station to the county jail, and while he was surrounded by dozens of policemen under tight security. This occurred even though the Dallas police and the FBI had earlier received telephone calls warning that Oswald would be shot during the transfer. Telephone records found in Ruby’s apartment revealed that he had Mafia connections and that an unusually large number of telephone calls had occurred between him and Mafia figures and hit-men throughout the United States in the weeks preceding the assassination. It has never been proven that Oswald was on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building at the time of the shooting. Also, while Oswald was in the custody of the Dallas police, paraffin tests conducted on his cheek did not show he had fired a rifle on November 22. Tests conducted by the FBI concluded that Oswald’s fingerprints were not on the rifle that was found on the sixth floor of the School Book Depository about forty-five minutes after the shooting. There was, however, a semblance of a palm print lifted earlier by the Dallas police that was identified by them as belonging to Oswald. Oswald was soon shown in a photograph found in his garage showing him holding the rifle. This photograph was almost immediately branded to be a fake composite by photographic experts and later by Scotland Yard and Canadian experts. Within hours after the assassination, information came pouring out from the FBI concerning Oswald. The FBI, which had been tracking him for years, knew he was in Dallas and had been in contact with him (the FBI tried to suppress this). Oswald was twenty-four years old. The FBI branded him a Communist. He had defected to the Soviet Union in 1959 and then returned to the U.S. about two years later with a"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"new bride he had married while in Russia. Before going to the Soviet Union, he had been in the Marine Corps and had defected immediately after having received an early discharge, on the basis of his mother allegedly being ill. Oswald spoke fluent Russian although he had not finished high school and had no known formal training in the language. He had a recent history of being a political agitator. A few months after the assassination of Kennedy he was accused of having attempted in April 1963 to assassinate General Edwin Walker, a right-wing extremist. He also had been a pro-Castro political agitator and had traveled to Mexico City in September 1963 to visit the Soviet and Cuban consulates there. In addition, there was testimony by a woman in Dallas, Silvia Odio (whose story was confirmed by her sister, her father, and her psychiatrist), that Oswald and two other men (who appeared to be Cubans and claimed they were part of a left-wing, anti-Castro Cuban exile group) visited her apartment in Dallas two months before the assassination. Later, in a telephone call to Mrs. Odio, one of the Cubans made a comment about Oswald being a crazy ex-Marine talking about assassinating Kennedy. The time that the three men were at her apartment appeared to conflict with a time when Oswald was believed to have been in Mexico and was two months before Kennedy was assassinated. This created the suspicion that someone was impersonating Oswald, trying to set him up as a patsy connected to Cubans; if not that, he was in fact in a conspiracy with leftist anti-Castro Cubans. From the above, it did not take much imagination for many people to suspect the following: -There was a conspiracy involving several people. -The conspiracy probably involved the criminal underworld who had ordered their underling Jack Ruby to silence Oswald. -The conspiracy seemed to involve sophisticated planning to create impersonators of Oswald. -Oswald appeared to be some sort of Soviet agent or U.S. secret agent, possibly connected to military intelligence. -It appeared that Oswald was part of a conspiracy but may have been set up as a patsy to divert attention away from the prime conspirators, or to further a political aim. -Although the conspiracy was sophisticated, it was bungled because of the necessity of publicly silencing Oswald and the immediate transparency of the two Oswalds. Within a few hours after the assassination, the Dallas police and the FBI announced that the assassination was committed by a lone gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald, and that Oswald was a Communist. The case was closed before it got started. About one week after the assassination, a presidential commission to investigate the crime (The Warren Commission) was created by the new president, Lyndon Johnson. The instruction given to the Commission, in essence, was to put to bed any questions regarding the possibility of a conspiracy so that the country could get on with its business. The FBI, under director J. Edgar Hoover, was given the sole authority by Lyndon Johnson to conduct the investigations and to provide information to the Commission. All other investigations throughout the nation were ordered by Johnson to cease. The Commission included Allen Dulles, who had recently been fired as director of the CIA (as a scapegoat) by John Kennedy. Despite increasing evidence and doubts continuing to indicate the likelihood of a conspiracy, the Commission published a report ten months after the assassination stating that Jack Ruby had no substantial connection with organized crime and had acted out of grief in killing Oswald; that the Dallas police did not assist Ruby in the killing of Oswald; that Oswald was probably a lone assassin; and that Oswald had not been an agent of the U.S. government or of any foreign power. The report also concluded that there was no evidence of a conspiracy from within or outside the U.S. One of those who gained the most from the crime, President Lyndon Johnson, ordered that the files concerning the assassination be sealed in the National Archives for seventy-five years."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Commission was never able to explain the mysterious two Oswalds, and it was never able to come up with a motive for Oswald murdering Kennedy. Not once in the Commission report was the possibility even suggested that the Mafia or any member of the U.S. government might be involved. But the report succeeded: a great illusion was set in place. The news media and the American people took the bait that Oswald was the lone assassin, although the Commission had not specifically said so. The rest of the world scoffed: they saw a conspiracy in which John Kennedy had been murdered by his political enemies. The Warren Commission Report was at first received with open approval by the media establishment and by the American public. The media did not question the fact that the chief beneficiaries of the assassination—Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover— had taken control of the entire investigation. But the Commission report was soon attacked by a few brave reporters, writers, and skeptics. An ever-rising chorus of disdain for the Commission and its official report reached a point by 1996 where 89 percent of the American people believed there was a conspiracy of some sort, although few had a clear idea of what had really happened. [12] Then, in early 1992, Oliver Stone came out with his bombshell movie JFK in which he painted John Kennedy as a hero who was killed for standing up to the military industrial complex; and he portrayed Jim Garrison, a New Orleans district attorney who had attempted to prove a conspiracy, as a mild-mannered family man and hero taking on the CIA and the entrenched powers in Washington. In the closing scenes of the movie, Stone had Kevin Costner (who played Garrison) speculate that Lyndon Johnson and the military industrial complex were behind the assassination conspiracy to escalate the Vietnam War. The news media went into what seemed a strange frenzy of attacks on Stone. The attacks started six months before the film was released. They painted him as a conspiracy nut, a distorter of historical truth, and perhaps un-American or even mentally disturbed. The result was more confusion and bewilderment, with few knowing what to believe. Why was the media so upset? Although I found myself disagreeing with the extremity of Stone’s message, it occurred to me that he had made a valiant and powerful attack on cherished illusions, thus triggering the inevitable reactions when illusions are threatened. It was in late 1991 that I began a serious attempt to understand for myself what had happened in the Kennedy assassination. I decided to write a short paper on the subject, but was soon involved in a quagmire that would take far more effort and willpower to work through than I possibly could have imagined."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"4 WHY DID IT HAPPEN—AN HYPOTHESIS How could any conspiratorial group have summoned the will to carry out such an extreme act so fraught with the possibilities of being uncovered? [13] That question deserves serious thought: To conceive, plan, and carry out a sophisticated conspiracy to assassinate the president of the United States requires a cold-blooded, deliberate decision of awesome proportions. Only a group with enormous power, capability, and resources would even consider it. Therefore, it seems most reasonable to assume that the assassination was conceived by powerful men who were not crazy but, on the contrary, were realists. With that premise, the answer to the question could be threefold: First, the group would have to believe that they could get away with it. This means that the plotters knew that no matter what could go wrong they were in a position to (a) suppress evidence, (b) avoid prosecution, and (c) keep the Kennedy family silent. This indicates that the essential ingredients of their plan would be control of the presidency and Congress, and blackmail material on the Kennedys in the plotters’ possession. A group as calculating as the plot has revealed itself to be indicates that the conspirators were very sophisticated. The plan would have been aborted before it got started unless they felt absolutely certain that it would succeed. Second, the plotters must have been very confident of their capability to carry out the mechanics of the plan. This meant that within the group were professionals—skilled at planning and executing major assassinations. This points to the CIA and the Mafia, or possibly others who had access to a top professional assassination planner and assassins. Third, there must have been a powerful, overwhelming motivation in the prime leaders of the conspiratorial group. The strongest motivator of man is the need to survive. If survival is sufficiently threatened, most men will kill. It is a primary instinct. Survival means different things to different people. For some it means life itself. For others it means the capacity to carry on in an all-consuming pursuit of power and money. To be shorn of power and money to this type of man (with the added threat of imprisonment) would be symbolic castration and a psychological end to life. This theory of human needs was developed by the great psychologist Abraham H. Maslow. [14] . His theory is that normal people organize their lives by instinctively ranking their needs from most important to least important. Since it is never possible to satisfy all their needs at one time, the most important ones are satisfied first. Human needs are visualized as being in a five-tiered structure in which the needs at the base (survival) are the strongest. I see in Maslow’s theory the theoretical underpinnings of what I hypothesize were the primary motives for assassinating John F. Kennedy—that is, the basic need of the prime conspirators for survival. As a caveat to Maslow’s theory, it seems apparent that the perception of a threat to one’s survival (or other needs) could be as important as the reality . For example, ultra-right-wing extremists might feel that they were being direly threatened by John Kennedy when in fact they were not. But, nevertheless, they might be motivated to join an assassination plot out of their paranoiac fears. Now let us consider that jealousy and envy could have played a secondary part. Maslow wrote that as much as we don’t want to admit it, there is a considerable portion of hostile envy in many of us when we view excellence, beauty, charisma, and superior intelligence in others. Certainly we love and admire good men, saints—honest, virtuous, clean men. But could anybody who has looked into the depths of human nature fail to be aware of our mixed and often hostile feelings toward saintly men? Or toward very beautiful women or men? Or toward great creators? Or"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"toward our intellectual geniuses? It is not necessary to be a psychotherapist to see this phenomenon —let us call it “Counter-valuing.” Any reading of history will turn up plenty of examples, or perhaps even I could say that any such historical search might fail to turn up a single exception throughout the whole history of mankind. We surely love and admire all the persons who have incarnated the true, the good, the beautiful, the just, the perfect, the ultimately successful. And yet they also make us uneasy, anxious, confused, perhaps a little jealous or envious, a little inferior, clumsy. They usually make us lose our aplomb, our self-possession and self-regard. (Nietzsche is still our best teacher here.) Here we have a first clue. My impression so far is that the greatest people, simply by their presence and by being what they are, make us feel aware of our lesser worth, whether or not they intend to. If this is an unconscious effect and we are not aware of why we feel stupid or ugly or inferior whenever such a person turns up, we are apt to respond with projection; i.e., we react as if he were trying to make us feel inferior, as if we were the target (L. Huxley, 1963). Hostility is then an understandable consequence . [15] As we study Maslow’s words, can we not ask ourselves: Is there doubt that these deep feelings may escalate violently when the admired person is threatening our very existence and can be seen as a deceptive hypocrite who is fooling everybody with his charm? It is compelling to me that the Kennedy brothers, John and Robert—whether out of noble intentions or out of their own pursuit of power—were in the process of inflicting these injuries on a group of powerful men. At the same time, they were playing both ends against the middle. They had used some of these men to gain power and were now throwing them overboard. They were cleaning house with a vengeance. The Kennedys were going to get rid of all the bad guys in a hurry by handing them their heads on a platter. They had set out to dismantle the combined forces of the national security state and organized crime. They may have had noble motives but they were courting disaster. In his book The Kennedys: Dynasty and Disaster , John Davis had this to say about the compulsion of the Kennedys to court disaster. ...The Kennedy brothers were reckless and overconfident. Spoiled by the enormous political and financial power at their command, they thought they were invulnerable. The Kennedys believed they were destined to lead the free world for at least sixteen years. No one could thwart that destiny. The Kennedys, young and ambitious, lived and ruled at the edge of disaster. On the one hand, they courted publicity as few presidential families had done in the past and, on the other, they took enormous risks in both their public and their personal lives. Those risks were made even more chancy by the publicity they drew and the sort of enemies they had. In reviewing their careers, we observe that the Kennedy brothers continually courted disaster. Joe Kennedy, Jr., courted disaster when he volunteered for a virtually suicidal mission in World War II in a desperate effort to outdo his brother Jack’s alleged heroics in the Pacific. John F. Kennedy’s relationships with Judith Campbell and powerful Mafiosi Sam Giancana and Johnny Rosselli, who had been hired by the CIA to kill Castro and were, at the same time, being hounded by brother Bobby, were courting disaster. In pursuing these relationships, Kennedy was laying himself open to potentially catastrophic blackmail. Robert Kennedy’s involvement in the assassination plots against Castro and his affair with Marilyn Monroe were courting disaster and he must have known it. Teddy Kennedy was courting disaster when he took a young, unmarried woman for a spin in his car one night on Chappaquiddick Island.... [16] This leads to a sub-thesis: The reckless, self-serving behavior of John Kennedy, and to a lesser extent"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"that of his brother Robert, could have led the conspirators to lose all respect for John Kennedy and use his recklessness as part of a convenient rationale (along with patriotism and anti-communism) to enable them to reach the extreme decision that the only way to get rid of the threat of the Kennedy brothers was by assassination. This is not to say that Kennedy was killed for his reckless and immoral behavior, but rather that it gave blackmail material and—for some of the conspirators who needed it—a rationale for recruiting lower-tier plotters, when the prime conspirators’ motive, in reality, was their own self- preservation and lust for power; i.e., John Kennedy’s behavior conveniently added fuel to the fire that was building around him. One of the most outrageous examples of the extreme recklessness of the Kennedys is the brothers’ affairs with Marilyn Monroe and the tragic ending. It exploded so violently that if revealed (and believed by the American people—a question in itself) would very likely have ended both of the brothers’ political careers. Some have speculated that it resulted in the murder of Marilyn Monroe, by orders of the Kennedy brothers themselves, after she threatened to expose their affairs and government secrets in a public announcement. Another hypothesis is that the Mafia murdered her, perhaps under the orders of the CIA, to silence her from telling of CIA/Mafia plots to kill Fidel Castro—or to bring media attention to the affair and create an implosion of scandal upon the Kennedys. There is, with little question, circumstantial evidence that conceivably could implicate the Kennedy brothers in the murder of Marilyn Monroe if one is only slightly inclined to suspicion. It does not stretch my imagination to suspect that a nod was given by the Kennedy brothers to the CIA or the FBI to handle the problem. [17] (No one knows with certainty, one way or the other.) But the Kennedys had the motive to have Marilyn murdered, because she was threatening to tell all and thereby ruin them forever. Tom Reddin, former chief of police of Los Angeles, said, “If you’ve been intimate with the president and the attorney general of the United States, as Monroe was, and if you have overheard high-level, sometimes top-secret conversations—learning things you shouldn’t know—what else do you need to be perceived as a threat?” [18] The evidence that Marilyn Monroe was murdered is substantial: Thomas Noguchi, then deputy coroner for the City of Los Angeles, in an interview on KABC television in Los Angeles said, “....murder might have been involved.” He called for a “new scientific inquiry into the death.” His challenge was never accepted. Evidence of foul play was in indications of violence—Noguchi observed a very fresh bruise in the lower back area and bruises on her arms. More telling indications were that someone had administered an injection of Nembutal into her rectum. [19] The cause of death was said by Los Angeles police chief William Parker to have been a massive overdose of sleeping pills which, experts said, would have required oral ingestion of more than seventy capsules in less than ten minutes. [20] Yet there was no residue of drug capsules remaining in her stomach. Biographer Anthony Summers in 1964 had one of the world’s foremost forensic scientists, Dr. Keith Simpson of London University, review the autopsy. His conclusions were that the barbiturate levels in Monroe’s blood should have produced a moderate residue of capsules in her stomach, but none was found there. [21] Dr. Robert Litman, the UCLA psychiatrist who headed a suicide prevention team in Los Angeles, said that Marilyn would have had to gulp down those pills, all of them, within a matter of minutes, a very few minutes. He said that if she had taken those pills a few at a time, she would have been unconscious before she could have ingested the amount needed to achieve the level of barbiturates found in her"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"bloodstream. [22] Dr. Ralph Greenson, Marilyn’s psychiatrist who was present at her home shortly after her death (if not before she had succumbed from the drug overdose), was interviewed by Los Angeles deputy district attorney John Miner within days of her death. Miner wrote a memorandum in which he concluded it was highly improbable that Marilyn killed herself. [23] Miner said that Greenson was vehement: “My patient did not commit suicide.” [24] Like many aspects of the Kennedy assassination, this story is so bizarre, so unbelievable, and so complicated that it defies explanation. Yet there is very compelling evidence [25] from multiple sources and witnesses that, at the very least , the following took place: 1. Marilyn Monroe had an extended sexual affair with John Kennedy. 2 . She had a short sexual affair with Robert Kennedy. 3. The Kennedy brothers decided to end their affairs with her after it became apparent that it could bring down their administration, when it was first being manifested in news stories that were starting to leak the secret, and when the nation’s bedroom spy, J. Edgar Hoover, let it be known to the Kennedys that he had the goods on them concerning the affair of John Kennedy with Judith Campbell Exner. 4. When Marilyn was told by the Kennedys that it was over she reacted with anger and threatened to call a press conference to expose all. 5 . Robert Kennedy was persuaded to come down from a vacation in Northern California to Brentwood in Los Angeles, where Marilyn lived, to try to calm her down. 6 . Robert Kennedy visited with Marilyn, left her unplacated, and within hours she either committed suicide or was murdered; the evidence as to which is inconclusive, but weighs toward murder. 7 . After Marilyn died, there was a massive cover-up, probably conducted by the Los Angeles police and assisted by the FBI, in which all evidence in Marilyn’s home that could incriminate the Kennedy brothers or embarrass the CIA was removed. This resulted in at least a three-hour delay after her death before the police were notified. Telephone records were confiscated from the telephone company, most likely by the FBI. By simply going with the above well-documented items, we have a sensational and extremely disturbing series of events that implicated the Kennedy brothers in either the suicide or murder of a famous movie actress who was being dumped by them after their having had sexual affairs with her. We must keep in mind that it was the president of the United States and his brother the attorney general who were having adulterous sexual affairs with a famous Hollywood movie actress, who was in a life-crisis and who died mysteriously, and that the details and evidence of the death were covered up. The implications of this are horrendous and potentially far-reaching in understanding the mystery of the JFK assassination. If we can now place ourselves in the minds of the conspirators, who probably already had a plan in mind in which John Kennedy would be assassinated, [26] we might well imagine that this would be the quintessential, final weapon the plotters needed—blackmail evidence against Robert Kennedy; and, in addition, evidence that John Kennedy was unfit to be president. A perfect rationale thus presented itself for recruiting those who were needed in the conspiracy, but perhaps had not yet been approached."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"In looking at John and Robert Kennedy’s fatal character flaws, I am not at all proposing that they did not have honorable intentions for the good of the nation. I am suggesting, however, that their inclination to corruption and hardball politics, and John Kennedy’s deep psychological problems (womanizing to a pathological extreme), may have had, and probably did have, a significant part in the assassination. I am not alone in this thought. Anthony Summers wrote that Professor Robert Blakey, former chief counsel of the HSCA, saw this flaw in Kennedy’s character—his womanizing—as one that may have been fatal. He quoted Blakey as saying it could have “left him vulnerable to assassination by organized crime....” [27] As for myself, I would go a step further and say that it could have made him vulnerable to assassination not only by organized crime, but also by government officials and special interests who were similarly threatened and motivated to get rid of the Kennedys. There is substantial evidence that the Mafia had tape recordings of the bedroom scenes with Marilyn and Robert Kennedy; [28] and we can rest assured that J. Edgar Hoover knew when and where it had happened, and most of the steamy details. We can also safely assume that the CIA knew; and of course the Secret Service knew. What an excuse! John Kennedy was a national security risk and had to be removed from office before he destroyed the fabric of the nation! Better yet, the Kennedy family would be placed in a position in which they would never be willing to press for an investigation of the crime for fear of their secrets being exposed. Now imagine taking this one step further and assuming that the CIA or the FBI did in fact order the murder of Marilyn to clean up the mess created by John and Robert Kennedy, even if not instructed to do so by them. What more justification was needed to proceed with the assassination? The security of the nation was at stake if the Kennedys were to be allowed to remain in power! But was this enough to reach the critical mass required before the decision to assassinate John Kennedy could be finalized? Why not simply expose the scandal to the American public and thus eliminate the Kennedys from the scene forever without the extreme act of assassination? And why November 1963? To answer these questions, let us jump ahead for the moment and assume [29] that Lyndon Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover, and the Mafia were part of the plot. Then venture the following possibilities: 1 . Time was running out with the 1964 presidential election only one year away. Once JFK was re-elected nothing short of impeachment would have legally removed him; and Lyndon Johnson was going to be dropped before the 1964 election and therefore would not become president if JFK were assassinated after the election; thus, Johnson would not be in a position to cover up the plot, or suppress the investigations of his own scandals. Moreover, with Johnson in the plot, it had to be done by the end of 1963 to give him time to orchestrate a cover-up with a presidential commission, establish his administration, and demonstrate his capability to be president. November 1963 was approaching the latest feasible date for action. 2. Even though J. Edgar Hoover had an abundance of incriminating material regarding the Kennedys’ sexual exploits, probably including all the salient details of the Marilyn Monroe affairs, and would have been delighted to expose the Kennedys, he was not in a position to use it because Hoover himself was vulnerable to exposure of his homosexuality and his ties to organized crime—a classic case of check and check-mate in a deadly game. Once JFK was re-elected, he might very well have called Hoover’s bluff and forced him to retire—and Hoover must have feared this. It was absolutely necessary that Kennedy be eliminated before the 1964 election so that Hoover’s friend, Lyndon Johnson would become president and re-appoint Hoover. 3. Exposing the Kennedys would have ruined them, but at the same time it would have ruined Hoover and Johnson. Both Hoover and Johnson must have known that the Kennedys would not be run"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"out of office without a fight which would have ended in catastrophe for everyone involved. 4. It would be indispensable to the Mafia that their man Lyndon Johnson become president after an assassination of John Kennedy because they could depend on Johnson to cover up the crime and remove Robert Kennedy from power. This could never happen if John Kennedy were to be re- elected in 1964 after he had replaced Johnson as vice president. In short, although not proof in itself, there are plenty of reasons—unique to the LBJ-Hoover-Mafia scenario—why a decision to assassinate John Kennedy in November 1963 would have been made rather than attempting to blackmail him or expose him to the public. The timing of the assassination, as related to the singular requirements of LBJ, Hoover, and the Mafia, explains many things. What other scenario fits so well? None that I can think of now. * * * In summary, I wrote down my hypothesis [30] of the motives for the assassination: It was staying in power in order to survive that drove the prime conspirators to their act. Revenge and envy were additional factors. Political ideology was also a factor, but not a prime factor. A key ingredient was the conspirator’s conviction that they had the political power and resources to be certain that they would not be brought to justice for murdering the president of the United States. The conspirators also knew that the Kennedy family would be forced to remain quiet because of the brothers’ involvement in a multiplicity of scandals, of which the conspirators had evidence. An important insight in the foregoing analysis is that it could explain why John Kennedy was not removed from office by exposing his scandalous behavior. Such revelations would inevitably have brought down both Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover along with the Kennedys. Only by assassinating John Kennedy in 1963 would the problems be solved for Johnson and Hoover. Will we ever understand fully why the Kennedy brothers felt they could conduct themselves as they did—and move so aggressively against such powerful forces as they did—without violent reaction? That will remain a mystery for others to unravel, but I feel it can be said with some certainty that the Kennedys did not have a realistic sense of limits. Their father Joe had instilled in them an unbridled ambition and a belief that they could have anything they wanted—seize power, and, in the name of good, eliminate the opposition while at the same time live out every man’s fantasies. In retrospect, I see the Kennedy brothers as young, misguided, reckless, and naive, albeit having the good of the nation in their hearts and intentions. Given the circumstances and politics of the time, they had overstepped the practical limits of presidential power and privilege. They were to be removed from power by the same forces they were intent on crushing."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"5 PRIME SUSPECTS Having now gotten the rudiments of a possible understanding of the “how and why” of the crime, I decided to get more specific and make an analysis of motive, means, and opportunity in order to develop a list of suspects. In addition, I looked at declared intention to kill . First I listed the powerful enemies of John and Robert Kennedy who are known to have existed in 1963. This list astounded me in the power it represented: Carlos Marcello, Mafia chieftain in New Orleans and Dallas. Bobby Kennedy was on a vendetta to destroy Carlos Marcello. He had illegally deported him to Guatemala; later, after great ordeal and humiliation, Marcello surreptitiously returned to the United States. At the time of the assassination, the young attorney general was in the process of deporting Marcello again in a trial being conducted in New Orleans. Marcello hated Bobby Kennedy and had stated in 1962 that John Kennedy would be killed. He even described how it would later be done. Marcello also had a connection to Oswald, whose uncle (and surrogate father) was a Marcello lieutenant. Jimmy Hoffa, president of the Teamsters Union. Jimmy Hoffa and Bobby Kennedy were mortal enemies. Hoffa had threatened Bobby Kennedy’s life and had made inquiries and spoken repeatedly about having him assassinated. Bobby Kennedy was determined to put Jimmy Hoffa in prison. Hoffa was closely connected to the Mafia. Santo Trafficante, Jr., Mafia chieftain in Tampa. Trafficante, a close associate of Carlos Marcello, declared in 1962 that “Kennedy would be hit” before the 1964 election. Trafficante was a principal in the CIA-Mafia plot to kill Castro. He was also a close associate of Meyer Lansky in Florida. Both Trafficante and Lansky had suffered severe losses in their gambling operations in Cuba when Castro took over and kicked them out. They shared a common motive with anti-Castro Cubans who felt betrayed by Kennedy in the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Sam Giancana, Mafia chieftain in Chicago. A suspect because he had been betrayed by the Kennedys who took his favors and then turned on him. Giancana was a prime target in Robert Kennedy’s war against organized crime. He was a major Mafia chieftain, covering all territory west of the Mississippi. He was also a principal in the CIA-Mafia plot to kill Castro. When he found that he was being “double crossed” by John Kennedy, Giancana said, “This is murder!” J. Edgar Hoover . It was no secret that the Kennedys had contempt for Hoover and wanted him out of his lifetime position as head of the FBI. It was common talk that Hoover would be fired soon after John Kennedy was elected in 1964. Hoover hated Bobby Kennedy; hated Martin Luther King, whom the Kennedys supported; and was very close and friendly with Lyndon Johnson. Hoover’s second-in-command and suspected homosexual lover, Clyde Tolson, said of Robert Kennedy, “I hope someone shoots and kills the son of a bitch.” Also, over the years Hoover had allowed himself to be compromised by the Mafia and Texas oil men in accepting free rent of a vacation bungalow in California, tips on fixed horse races, and sweetheart investments. It must have been very disturbing to Hoover to witness the Kennedys’ unprecedented effort to bring down organized crime, which inevitably would have exposed Hoover. Lyndon Johnson. The last discussion that John Kennedy had with his secretary, Evelyn Lincoln,"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"before leaving for Dallas was that Johnson would be dropped from the ticket for the 1964 presidential election. This was because Johnson had become a political liability and was in deep trouble, with potentially a prison sentence if the full facts were uncovered concerning the Bobby Baker and Billie Sol Estes scandals. Johnson hated Bobby Kennedy and resented the Kennedys in general. He stood to be president if Kennedy were killed. His corrupt connections to the Mafia, Dallas political figures, and the Texas right wing, like Hoover’s, would be exposed if the Mafia were brought down. Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Military. Dulles, along with Charles Cabell and Richard Bissell, had been fired by Kennedy. The CIA was Dulles’s baby and lifetime of work. Cabell was head of clandestine operations (and the brother of the mayor of Dallas). Bissell headed up the Bay of Pigs operation. Kennedy fired these men because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Also, Kennedy had vowed to “blow the CIA to smithereens” after the next election. Dulles had many loyalists in the CIA, including the infamous E. Howard Hunt (later of Watergate), and Richard Helms. Added to this complex brew was army intelligence, which was in competition with the CIA for covert operations and was under the control of generals with extreme right-wing ideologies and strong connections to the military-industrial complex. And there was William Harvey, a legendary, pistol-packing, hard- drinking master theorist and covert operator. Harvey was in charge of the CIA-Mafia group to assassinate foreign leaders and had become personal friends with the Mafia’s Johnny Rosselli. Harvey hated Robert Kennedy with a passion because Kennedy had stripped him of power after Harvey had sent unauthorized commando teams into Cuba at the height of the Cuban missile crisis. There were many thousands of spies, agents, and operators in the CIA and military intelligence. Many were in fragmented, competing rogue groups, perhaps containing even Soviet moles, operating essentially on their own agendas, and penetrated by other agencies of the U.S. government with their own unique capacities for betrayal. Anti-Castro Cubans in Miami. One of their CIA leaders was E. Howard Hunt. Their liaison with the Defense Department was Major General Edward Lansdale. Many of them hated Kennedy because they felt he let them down by not providing air cover in the Bay of Pigs invasion. They also believed that he was going to make peace with Castro and betray them. In fact, John Kennedy was in the process of doing just that at the time he was assassinated. Involved in the anti-Castro effort was David Ferrie, who was first turned up by the FBI (and then immediately dropped) and later targeted by Jim Garrison in his investigation in New Orleans. David Ferrie was also a close associate of Mafia chieftain Carlos Marcello and a contract agent for the CIA and an associate of Oswald and an associate of Clay Shaw who was, in turn, a CIA contract agent and right-wing radical associated with extremist groups in Europe. Right-wing extremist groups such as the John Birch Society, the Minutemen, White Supremacists, and some Texas oil men. This group of rabid anti-Communists and fanatics looked at Kennedy as being soft on communism and leading the country to socialism because of Kennedy’s refusal to go ahead with the Bay of Pigs invasion; their perception that he had sold out to Khrushchev in the Cuban missile crisis; and Kennedy’s pursuit of civil rights legislation and his support of Martin Luther King. And the word was out that Kennedy would be withdrawing our troops from Vietnam as soon as he was re-elected. This disparate group included such people as Texas oil man H. L. Hunt, Clint Murchison in Dallas, and Joseph A. Milteer in Miami. Milteer was the leader of the arch-conservative National States Rights Party as well as a member of other groups such as The Congress of Freedom and The White Citizens Council of Atlanta and the Ku Klux Klan. Milteer was known, by a Miami police informant, to have outlined in advance (on November 9, 1963) the details"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"of the assassination of President Kennedy. H. L. Hunt, a strong financial supporter of Lyndon Johnson and right-wing fanatic and oil man, had sponsored black-border ads vilifying Kennedy during his trip to Dallas. The Texas right wing would have been in an ideal position to bring Lyndon Johnson into the plot and control events in Dallas. They knew Johnson well, and probably had him in their pockets, perhaps even more than did the Mafia. Clint Murchison was also a financial supporter of Lyndon Johnson as well as George Lincoln Rockwell’s American Nazi party. David Ferrie and Carlos Marcello were also rabid, active right-wingers. The right wing had powerful allies within the CIA and military intelligence; and the military and military reserve. They also were allies with ex-Nazi groups in Europe (the Odessa and Eastern European exiles) and allied with OAS terrorists, who in turn had their anti-Communist allies in extreme elements of European intelligence and Israel’s intelligence, the Mossad. (The extreme right wing in the United States was a strong supporter of the OAS in France in their efforts to assassinate or overthrow Charles de Gaulle. JFK supported Algeria’s freedom, which was violently opposed by the OAS and the Mossad.) Fidel Castro . John and Robert Kennedy and the Mafia were involved in an all-out plan to destroy Castro. This included assassination attempts using the Mafia and anti-Castro Cubans, and extensive CIA operations planned and being executed against Cuba out of Miami and New Orleans. It also included an ultra-secret project to overthrow Castro from within Cuba. In fact, on the very day of the Kennedy assassination, the CIA was in a meeting in Paris, France, passing an exotic weapon to an assassin to murder Castro. Castro had threatened Kennedy with retaliation. Castro had warned that the attempts of the U.S. to assassinate him would not go unanswered. Nikita Khrushchev. Kennedy had humiliated Khrushchev in the Cuban missile crisis, which some historians now believe was the beginning of the end of Khrushchev’s career as head of the Soviet Union. Richard Nixon. Kennedy had defeated Richard Nixon in 1960 for the presidential election and Nixon believed that Kennedy had bought the election in Chicago with his father’s money. Few know that Nixon was in Dallas the day Kennedy was killed. Also, few know that Nixon had an extensive history that went back into the early 1950s in connections with mobsters. Nixon was reputed to have received $500,000 in cash from Carlos Marcello as campaign contributions. Nixon’s organized crime contacts continued even after he resigned the presidency in disgrace; he played golf with mobsters such as Allen Dorfman at the La Costa Country Club in California. Nixon’s experience in assassinations went back to the late 1950s when he was President Eisenhower’s man for coordinating CIA assassinations and covert political murders. Nixon was the right-wing choice for president and was deeply involved with the CIA in anti-Castro activities when he was vice president. My next step would be to try to narrow down the list of suspects."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"6 NECESSARY MEANS I was now at the point where I could draw tentative conclusions as to the most likely suspects based on motivation and declared intention to kill. But before doing that, I listed the means to carry out and cover up the crime, which would have been necessary for the conspiracy to be successful. There are seven key capabilities that it seemed the conspirators would have considered indispensable, if it is assumed that they were rational, with sophistication: 1 . Control of the FBI. This could have been achieved only through the cooperation of J. Edgar Hoover. There had to be a way for the conspirators to be certain that Hoover would suppress or destroy critical evidence, and that there would not be a serious investigation of the crime. As will be detailed later, Hoover was compromised by organized crime and was subject to blackmail. He carried out his role to perfection. 2. Control of Lyndon Johnson. This would have been indispensable for the conspirators. If they did not know what Lyndon Johnson’s reaction would be, they would have had to rationally assume that he would react unpredictably or would have turned the full power of the federal government against the conspirators to uncover and convict them. Therefore, the conspirators either had to include Lyndon Johnson in their group, or they had to know that they had him in their pocket, based on having compromising knowledge about him; at least they probably would have given him advance knowledge of the plot. There was an abundance of blackmail material against Johnson. He masterminded the cover-up with genius. 3. A means to divert attention away from the conspirators. Without this, there would have been an outcry from Congress, the American people, and the news media that Johnson and Hoover would not have been able to contain. Deception was mandatory; it was obtained by the creation of the illusion that the assassination was carried out by either a person, or a group, connected to communism, with a plan that a designated patsy would be shot while escaping the scene. That person was Lee Harvey Oswald. This method of assassination by deception had been thoroughly developed by the CIA and military intelligence. [31] 4. Control, or partial control, of the Dallas police force. This would seem to have been necessary to handle the situation after the assassination to allow the real assassins to escape and Oswald to be killed attempting to leave the scene. This control also would have been necessary for Jack Ruby to walk into the Dallas police station basement with exquisite timing and kill Oswald on national television while surrounded by dozens of policemen. Ruby was a lower-level mob figure. He was part of the mob’s operations in Dallas to control the police through bribes and favors. Ruby was also connected to Carlos Marcello in New Orleans, had been active in Cuban gun- running activities and drug trafficking, and had been an FBI informant. 5. The need for an experienced professional assassin with a back-up. A sophisticated conspiracy would not logically have used an inexperienced rifleman with whom the conspirators had no previous experience. This implies that the group would have had access to known and trusted professional assassins. The Mafia and CIA qualify; and the extreme right wing had close ties to the Mafia and the military. A plan for the professional assassins to escape would also have been a necessary ingredient of the plot. 6. Control of the Secret Service. The Secret Service had control of Kennedy’s body from the time of the shooting until burial. They were intimately involved with the initial investigation in Dallas."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"They had control of all of the evidence at the scene and the autopsy. They had control of his protection. With Lyndon Johnson, they had the means to control the motorcade route. As a first priority, the plotters would have needed to know that they had control of the Secret Service. Before the assassination, Lyndon Johnson had first-hand access to the Secret Service and, upon becoming president, had full control. He also was involved in the planning of the Dallas trip along with his longtime friend and cohort John Connally, who, after much argumentation, established the parade route to pass through Dealey Plaza, an ideal spot for an assassination by crossfire. 7. Control of the CIA and Military Intelligence . The CIA and military intelligence are an obvious link to the Secret Service. Also, one would expect that the assassination of the president by a suspected Communist would trigger a massive reaction by U.S. intelligence and that any conceivable plotters (without U.S. intelligence as part of the plot) would feel the need to have control of U.S. intelligence. Could there be a coup without their cooperation, even if the plotters were from foreign criminal organizations? In addition, I surmised it would have been very desirable, probably absolutely necessary, for the conspirators to know that they would have support from the industrial-military-media establishment in 1963. The extremely reckless personal behavior of the Kennedy brothers and John Kennedy’s perceived inept handling of the Bay of Pigs crisis, as well as his perceived anti-business policies, could well explain the willingness of the established power structure not to demand a solution to the crime. Also, the fact that the United States government, along with the Kennedys, was planning to assassinate Fidel Castro could serve as a basis for a cover-up for national honor and security purposes. Further yet, the natural instinct of bureaucratic institutions, and both conservative and liberal establishments, to suppress and deny conspiracies of any kind, large or small (because it threatens the ally of entrenched power— the status quo), could be depended on by sophisticated conspirators to come into full force upon the assassination of a president in an internal or external plot. In summary, I concluded that the plotters needed to know in advance that by assassinating the president they would gain effective control of the entire government of the United States before they would have rationally pursued to finality a sophisticated plan to assassinate a popular president. Otherwise, I felt I must conclude that the assassination was by a small group of fanatics, similar to the Lincoln assassination. A grasp of this logic I felt was key to coming to grips with the evidence: The logic says that if a pattern of planning can be shown involving a variety of sophisticated people, then the plot inevitably must have reached all the way to the top of the government; otherwise it would not have been carried out. Put another way, it would be pointless for a sophisticated conspiratorial group to assassinate the president of a country unless they planned to take over the government. Otherwise, it would only be an act of spite or revenge which would be irrational, not the characteristic of a sophisticated group. It follows that the sophisticated group would let the vice president know their plan in advance so that he would be fully prepared to act as required to seize power and contain the crime. Therefore, I decided that as I examined the evidence I would look for signs of a comprehensive, broad-based plan involving professionals as opposed to a narrow conspiracy involving fanatics. This I hoped would lead me in the right direction. To keep my definitions clear I made the following notations: A sophisticated group would include and be controlled by key individuals drawn from, for example, such organizations as the CIA, the Mafia, the military, the FBI, high government officials, powerful businessmen, and extremely wealthy individuals, all of whom were threatened or felt threatened by the Kennedys. A basic premise of this book is that entire organizations were not"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"involved—only key individuals, and not necessarily those at the top of the hierarchy. A fanatical group would include and be controlled by, for example, individual white supremacists, Minutemen, anti-Castro Cubans, rabid anti-Communists, and the like. I realized that I could, of course, find a mix of both. My hypothesis was that control of the plot would be by the sophisticates if they were involved at all. One of my major goals now became to determine the nature and specific makeup of the conspiratorial group. I would start with the assumption that not all of Kennedy’s enemies were part of the conspiracy; only a few select and key individuals who were in a position to mastermind the plot and cover up the crime. The remainder of Kennedy’s enemies would be only too happy to watch from the sidelines."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"It was to Stalin’s advantage that at this moment Lenin should die. Robert Payne, The Life and Death of Lenin 7 NARROWING THE LIST OF SUSPECTS Using the premises previously outlined, I eliminated Nikita Khrushchev and Fidel Castro from the list because they did not have control of the FBI, the CIA, or Lyndon Johnson. I rejected the idea that either of them masterminded and carried out the assassination of the president of the United States because their chances of getting caught would have been so great and the consequences would have been utter catastrophe for them. They simply would not have gotten away with it. With the worldwide security and police apparatus of the United States, they would have been flushed out in short order and they must have known it. I also knew that virtually all serious researchers had reached this conclusion. As to Richard Nixon having been a principal in a conspiracy, I saw little to indicate it, despite his involvement with the Mafia. Also, what did Nixon have to gain? Obviously, a run at the presidency later against Lyndon Johnson, but that hardly seemed motivation to kill Kennedy. Nixon, however, I cautioned myself, could have known about it beforehand and should be examined later, along with other possibilities. “Right-wing extremists” is a broad category, but it did not seem that they, as a group or sub-group, would have had the overpowering motive to kill Kennedy or the organizational structure to carry it out and cover it up without assistance from the federal government; although individual economic interests might have been involved, and paranoiac fears might have led some of them to join in a plot. Milteer’s statement before the assassination implied to me that some of the right-wing extremists were at least aware of the plan and some of its details. The apparent inclination of some of the conspirators to brag about it in advance could explain this. But Milteer’s statement did imply that right-wing extremists were somehow in a circle of knowledge about the details of the assassination , indicating that they were part of a larger plot. I could see that Jimmy Hoffa had the survival motive but, by himself, did not have the capabilities to execute the plan and to cover it up. But he could very well have known about it, even initiated it, and been a part of a Mafia conspiracy. He was a tool of the Mafia. Lyndon Johnson also had the survival motivation but there was a dearth of hard evidence that tied him directly to the plot. [32] He, like Nixon, might have known about it beforehand and that deserved serious thought: Unless Johnson was duped, he appeared to have been a major figure in the cover-up, having been in charge of the Secret Service that illegally seized all the evidence and took it to Washington; and Johnson, along with J. Edgar Hoover, had carefully hand-picked the Warren Commission, and had manipulated Congress into dropping its investigation of the assassination. I decided to keep LBJ on the list because of his strong motivation and the fact that he was in the best position to control the cover-up. The anti-Castro Cubans in Miami by themselves did not have the means in any of the seven categories; however, they were, in part, controlled by the CIA. I decided for the moment to consider them as part of the involvement of the CIA. The military chiefs, although at odds with Kennedy, were not in a life-and-death struggle with him. Their power certainly was being challenged, and there was a struggle with Kennedy over military procurement, but it seemed implausible that the top military chiefs as a group could have become involved in a plot to assassinate their president; this seemed possible but, I thought, improbable. However, one or two of them, or a retired chief, could conceivably have been brought into the plot, and"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"this I considered as a secondary possibility. The CIA was subordinate to the National Security Agency (NSA) which also included the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and Army and Navy intelligence. It was difficult then, and still is, to distinguish operationally between the CIA and the military. Therefore, I thought that any considerations of the CIA should include the military. I would consider them as one and the same for general discussions. Later, I would try to separate them because one of the intelligence agencies might have been working in competition with the others, even to the point of setting up the CIA. I saw that the primary suspects on the list could be divided into five categories: 1. Mafia 2. LBJ 3. Hoover 4. CIA / Military 5. Secret Service The question now: What minimal combination of the five categories of suspects could have met the seven means requirements of: 1. Control of FBI 2. Control of Dallas Police (and silence Oswald) 3. Control of LBJ 4. Set up patsy (two Oswalds, etc.) 5. Professional assassins 6. Control of Secret Service 7. Control of CIA After examining these parameters in a matrix I reasoned that first, the Mafia was indispensable in all scenarios because of Jack Ruby (although H. L. Hunt and/or the Dallas police conceivably could have directly ordered Ruby to shoot Oswald, it seemed unlikely. More likely, the Mafia higher-ups would have been used as intermediaries with someone outside the Mafia as a cutout). Second, The CIA/Military was indispensable in all scenarios because without their cooperation, a coup and cover-up would be impossible, and the plot had all of the characteristics of an elaborate CIA/Military intelligence covert operation; third, the Secret Service was indispensable in all scenarios if for no more than to let down their guard, cooperate in the selection of the parade route, and cooperate in the cover-up that would inevitably follow the coup. Of course, there was always the possibility of blackmail of LBJ and Hoover to extort their cooperation, but it seemed that a sophisticated group of plotters would not depend on blackmail after the fact; perhaps blackmail before the fact, but then LBJ and Hoover would become an integral part of the conspiracy if they should yield to the blackmail. From that reasoning, I concluded that Hoover and LBJ would likely have been brought into the plot before the fact to assure that all bases were covered. Therefore, I saw that the most perfect combination, with the greatest probability of success, was: CIA/Military—Secret Service—Mafia—LBJ—Hoover But with LBJ in the conspiratorial group, Hoover could possibly have been relied upon to fall in line because of the Mafia having compromised him. Perhaps that risk would seem acceptable to the plotters once they had LBJ in their circle. LBJ would be the most valuable member of the group because he would become president and thereby have immediate authority over the entire executive branch, which includes the Secret Service, the military, the CIA, and the FBI. This represents the entire investigative and prosecuting capability of the United States government with the possible exception of congressional"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"investigating committees. (LBJ immediately quashed the initial formation of congressional investigation committees and formed the Warren Commission with all appointees selected by himself and Hoover, and all the information available to it furnished by the FBI. LBJ was the master manipulator of the Democratic Congress.) Thus, for my first test, I assumed that, at a minimum, the plotters were: CIA/Military—Secret Service—Mafia—LBJ 1) All the Mafia had to do was get the CIA involved and have the CIA recruit the Secret Service and LBJ, and it would have had a perfect conspiracy. 2) All LBJ had to do was recruit the CIA (who would use the Mafia as needed) and the Secret Service, and he had a perfect conspiracy. 3) Hoover would fall in line, after the fact, when confronted by LBJ and the Mafia with the blackmail material they had on him. 4) In this scenario the right-wing extremists, if involved at all, would provide money. The foregoing is a working hypothesis that would have to be tested before conclusions could be reached. Drawing on my past career as an engineer, I decided, for the most part, to follow the scientific method [33] in testing the hypothesis. By this process I realized that it was likely that the hypothesis would have to be modified, or would fail, or other combinations emerge. There were, of course, other possibilities, [34] but based on my preliminary research, a conspiracy including the CIA/military, the Mafia, the Secret Service, and Lyndon Johnson, with Hoover coming in after the fact, seemed the minimal combination that would work. I now paused to conceptualize a possible scenario that would fit the broad outline of the evidence and reasoning thus far."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":" 8 THE MASTERMIND I knew that one method used in solving a carefully planned crime is to try to put one’s self into the mind of the criminal and think through a plot that conforms to all the known evidence and could have been concocted by a logical mind. In a sense, this is a way of testing a theory and is compatible with the scientific method. It is also a way of attaining a broad perspective before becoming immersed in the minutiae. I determined to give this idea a try. Albert Einstein engaged in what he called “mind experiments” to conceive of his theory of relativity, later to be tested with his analyses and calculations. And many years later dramatically demonstrated by scientists to be true in actual measurements. Einstein defined the universe with this method. So why not use it to help solve a complex crime? I reasoned that in conspiratorial crimes, if one cannot conceive a plot that fits the evidence from the imagined point of view of the criminals, then perhaps the theory is not valid. Moreover, that is exactly what trial lawyers do when presenting their case to a jury; the jury wants to see a theory of the crime to go along with the evidence, which must fit into the theory. And, as mentioned, I thought it would serve the additional purpose of giving the reader a preview of the broad picture to come, so that the significance of details in subsequent chapters could be more readily grasped. I found it helpful to list several key ingredients of the plan which appeared to be indicated simply by the evidence that was thus far available in my analysis. 1. The plan must have had a single individual who was designated to put it together and direct the operation. It did not seem plausible that such a complex project would have been directed by a committee. This did not preclude a group of individuals who gave their input, or some other individual who helped conceive the basic concept. [35] The one individual who put the operational plan together I called the Mastermind. 2. It seemed that the plan basically involved ambushing Kennedy in a crossfire, possibly planned with the illusion that it was a single gunman firing from the rear of the School Book Depository. However, it also seemed possible that the original plan was not to make it appear to be a single gunman; but rather an obvious conspiracy linked directly to Fidel Castro, in which case the single- gunman concept of the Warren Commission would have evolved after the fact. 3. The plan appeared to create the illusion that it was the work of Communists to divert suspicion away from right-wing extremists. Any appearance that it was a coup by forces within the United States was out of the question. 4. The plan obviously did not seem to include silencing Oswald in public in the basement of the Dallas jail. It seemed that the plan was to pin the crime on Oswald and kill him while he was leaving the scene of the crime, or to spirit him away where he would later be eliminated without anyone knowing about it. 5. It seemed that the plan would have had contingency sub-plans to take care of several possibilities: -- Linking bullets and empty cartridges to be found at the crime scene to Oswald’s rifle, to be certain that a link to Oswald, and thus to Castro, would be found. -- Controlling the results of the autopsy that would inevitably follow. -- Controlling the ensuing investigation which, by law in 1963, legally would be done by the"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Texas law authorities, but inevitably would involve the FBI, the Department of Justice, Congress, and the CIA. 6. Above all else, the plan must succeed on the first try— there would be no turning back after it was put into motion; the plan must be perfect with all bases covered, with contingency plans on contingency plans. I asked myself how these essential ingredients of the plot could have been conceived by the people on my list of suspects. What follows is one of several possible scenarios that seemed plausible. This scenario is deliberately bold, and reaches far. There will be plenty of time in the chapters that follow to retreat from this scenario if the evidence does not support it. I imagined that the initial idea of assassinating the president was hatched by two chieftains of organized crime (which I will call the “Outfit”), and they approached a wealthy right-wing extremist who then approached an ex-senior officer of military intelligence to join them in the plot. This group in turn approached a disgruntled officer in a rogue cult of military intelligence (or the CIA) who hated the Kennedys with a passion. He was designated to be the mastermind and to put together and execute a plan. The mastermind would be given access to all of the money and technical resources that he needed. The money would come from wealthy right-wing extremists and organized crime. The mastermind that I visualized was an expert in political assassinations, having been involved in the research and execution of many assassinations throughout the world for U.S. military intelligence or the CIA. I pictured the plan being presented by the mastermind to the prime conspirators at a secret meeting. This is how it might have sounded: THE PLAN Gentlemen: In accordance with your instructions, I will today outline a plan to remove John Kennedy from office and replace him with Vice President Lyndon Johnson. We all know that we have tried to accommodate the Kennedys but, arrogantly, they have not listened. They are recklessly bent on getting rid of us. It has boiled down to this: It’s either them or us. I know we all agree we have no choice but to take the ultimate action. If the Kennedys are left unchecked we can be assured that everything for which we have worked our whole lives will be destroyed and many of us will end up in the penitentiary. The Kennedys are intent on changing the entire direction of the country. They are caving in to the Communists and dismantling the military establishment. Kennedy has demonstrated that he is unfit to be Commander in Chief. We know, based on our source in the National Security Council, that we may have to make a decision soon for a preemptive nuclear strike against the Soviets. We also know, beyond a doubt, that Kennedy will not have the spine to pull the trigger. Our nation could well be annihilated by a Soviet first nuclear strike while our “profile-in- courage” president bites his nails. As patriots, we cannot let that happen. To begin, we should realize first and foremost that our action will be considered to be the crime of the century. Therefore it absolutely must succeed on the first try . Half-hearted or thinly planned efforts are out of the question. If Kennedy should live after an attempt to assassinate him, we must assume that the full power of the federal government would be unleashed and our plot would be uncovered. We all would be executed. Therefore, once we start there is no turning back, and we must be prepared to take whatever subsequent steps are necessary to cover up the crime and seize complete control of the nation."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"We also must realize that a perfect assassination, although theoretically possible, is seldom achieved. Thus we must have a plan in place to cover up unforeseen events that may occur. Fortunately, Lyndon Johnson will become president and it can confidently be predicted that he will be disposed to join our group if approached with an ingenious and well-thought-out plan. He despises the Kennedy brothers. They have repeatedly humiliated him, made him the butt of jokes, and he knows that they are going to dump him from the ticket in the next election because of the criminal problems he has gotten himself into. If his problems go on unchecked, he will quite probably be sent to the penitentiary. Lyndon has been obsessed with becoming president since anyone can remember. His entire life has been marked by his willingness to do anything or to commit any crime in order to get elected or cover up his indiscretions. There is absolutely nothing he will not do to satisfy his insatiable lust for power. Although he has recently shown liberal tendencies, we know that in reality he believes in nothing except power. He will have no choice but to do our bidding because he has compromised himself with us so completely. He will go along when the question is put to him. Our friends in the Outfit have given him enormous bribes, have carried out some very extreme operations for him, and we know every bit of dirt on him. He will not be a problem. The next step will be to get to J. Edgar Hoover. Once we get Lyndon aboard, that will be easy. We know that they are personal friends and confidants. We know that Edgar hates Jack Kennedy and absolutely loathes Bobby, who has repeatedly humiliated the old faggot. Bobby has bypassed him at will. He has forced him to greatly increase his paltry activities against the Outfit. He has made him the butt of jokes and derision in Washington. In addition, we all know that the president is going to dump Edgar after the next election, and all of the old hypocrite’s secrets will be uncovered. The president knows that regardless of the dirt that Edgar has on him, he has even worse dirt on Edgar. For these reasons we can be assured that Hoover will not be a problem and will go along with our plan. So, with Lyndon in our plan, and Edgar on board, and our own intelligence operations in charge, we will have complete control of the investigative and prosecutorial capabilities of the entire federal government. Congress will not be a problem because, with Edgar’s secret files and our own incriminating information on key members of Congress, we will have them firmly in hand. As we well know, the military-industrial establishment is very concerned about the Kennedys and will be happy to see them gone. John Kennedy’s performance in the Bay of Pigs is unforgivable. Not just because he failed to show the decisiveness and courage needed to make that program a success, but because he so eagerly jumped aboard thinking that it would provide him with a great political coup during his first few months in office. He stuck his finger in the pie by agreeing with some of his advisers to change our plans at the last moment, but when the going got rough he chickened out. Now I must confess that we went ahead anyway, knowing the operation against Castro would probably fail, with the intention of trapping Kennedy into a major military action against Cuba, rather than be seen as a coward by the American people. But we underestimated him. He may have been too smart for us. Anyway, we know, as do all of our friends, that Kennedy’s supposed victory over Khrushchev in the Cuban missile crisis was a sham, and that in reality he agreed not only to remove our Jupiter missiles from Turkey and Italy, but also never to invade Cuba again. Then, to make matters worse, he never insisted on finalizing a formal agreement with Khrushchev, never enforced on-site inspection to see that the missiles were removed, [36] and, in fact, we know the missiles were not removed and remain in Cuba. There is only one alternative, and we may rest assured that the military-industrial establishment will look the other way after the assassination and will pressure the news media to get the assassination behind us. As far as the Kennedy family is concerned, they can be expected to fold up and go away. They will"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"not want the world to see the full truth about Jack and Bobby’s peccadillos with their Hollywood movie star and their zealous participation in our partnership with the Outfit to assassinate Castro. Bobby is in that up to his eyeballs. If he is exposed, it would ruin him politically. The Kennedy family has so many secrets they want to keep that they will do absolutely nothing now or forever to investigate the assassination. [37] We will have the Kennedys by the balls once President Jack has been eliminated. As to the American people, we know that they live in comfortable illusions, shielded from the reality of the real world. They have no clue as to how it really works. They need to believe. We can be assured that they will accept an official story that will be presented to them shortly after we take over the government. This story, in the form of a Presidential Commission’s report, will describe the assassination as the act of a lone nut, or with an accomplice, backed by Cuba or the Soviets. We will design the cover so that we will have flexibility to use either the lone-nut scenario or, even better, an assassination conspiracy by Cuba as an excuse to invade it and, once and for all, get rid of Castro. These flexible contingency aspects of the plan insure that Lyndon can use the threat of nuclear war with the Soviets as a ruse to intimidate government officials to cooperate in a cover-up, if the need should arise. With our man Lyndon becoming president, armed with foreknowledge of the assassination, he will appear as a strong and steady hand to guide the people through their shock and grief. The American people will be only too eager to deny the reality—on that we can depend. I am handing out reprints of some essays by William James and Sigmund Freud that will refresh your memory on the subject of illusion and denial. As you know, our behavioral research has fully confirmed these concepts. They work. This phenomenon of the masses, in which they need to live in a comfortable illusion, spoon-fed by pleasant information from the government, will form the foundation of our deception plan for the aftermath of the assassination. Once our “official” story is accepted, it will forever be in the minds of the masses, incapable of being renounced by them unless led to do so by a future government. Also, as you know, we intend to keep control of the key levels of government and the Department of Justice for the foreseeable future, so we can be assured that a serious investigation will never be made in our lifetime. By that time, the official story will be permanent. Future administrations will not have the motive or need to change it. [38] Having said this, we must not fall into the trap of believing that we can get away with a sloppy plan because there are limits to how much we can cover up. For this reason, we must create a plan that is so ingenious, so creative, and so cunning that there will be, in all probability, nothing to cover up. This meticulously crafted plan will be very helpful in bringing aboard the top officials and the top professional assassins that are mandatory to make the plan absolutely foolproof. We can now get down to some nuts-and-bolts planning which must take into account these basics: •The basic concept of the plan is to make the assassination appear to be the work of a political fanatic in a conspiracy connected to Cuba. For sure, we do not want the American public for one moment to think that it was a conspiracy originating in the U.S. For that reason, poisoning of the president is out; it would obviously be branded as an inside job and therefore a domestic conspiracy. Or having him attacked by one crazed assassin with a pistol is also out of the question. These methods would be too easily traced and have too much possibility of going wrong. For example, poisoning attempts have been made on Fidel Castro and Patrice Lumumba and they have failed miserably. Other attempts by lone assassins on heads of states have worked only if the lone assassin was truly a lone nut and not part of a conspiracy. •I have concluded that the killing must be done by rifle fire and by a cool-headed professional with back-up professionals. It is obvious that we cannot depend on an untrained or unstable recruit to do the job. Also, from my experience, we will not be able to recruit the world-class professionals we"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"need if we do not have a plan that they believe will allow them to escape. Use of a handgun up close would not permit that. I have thought about this long and carefully, and have produced a plan that at first may appear complicated but I am sure you will see is quite workable. The plan will be carried out in three parallel phases. I will now show the organizational structure: (Operates slide projector) These three phases will be compartmentalized. The project manager will report only to me, the chief planner. Only the project manager will know who is in charge of each phase and the ultimate details of the operation, but he will not know the identity of anyone on the committee except me. This will have the desirable benefit of you gentlemen being entirely divorced from the operation except for your specific roles in the committee. In particular, Hoover and Johnson will not know the details of the plan or the identity of members of the committee. They will know only that it is going to happen and that their primary roles will be to contain the ensuing investigation. The patsy will be fingered immediately by fabricated evidence that will be irrefutable. We have recruitment procedures to insure that Lyndon and Edgar can be brought into the plot and inextricably linked without their knowing more than they need to know. They will like that, of course. The project manager will be an expendable cutout. I will personally take care of that task. Once he is eliminated, no one except those present here today will know who we are or know the master plan of our operation. And none of you will know who did the actual shooting or the people involved in the operations; and none who carried out the mechanics of the plot will know who was behind it, or who financed it, or who were in the other compartments. In our plan Kennedy will be shot with a rifle, apparently from a tall building, while he is riding in an open limousine. We know he prefers this type of exposure for political reasons. With Lyndon in a position to arrange political trips and parade routes, we can reasonably be assured that a suitable opportunity can be found sometime within the next six to eight months. Perhaps Miami will be a good location, or Chicago, or Los Angeles, but if necessary, Texas, at the beginning of the political campaign this fall. Of no small importance, we must have this over with before the end of the year to give Lyndon time to consolidate his position before the 1964 election. Therefore, we have no time to waste. In order for our professional assassins to believe they will escape, we need to have it appear that two shots are coming from one direction when the real shot by the professional is coming from another,"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"using one of our state-of-the-art silenced weapons. There will be two audible shots. This means that we must recruit a patsy; we will locate him near the fake assassin’s post, and he must be someone who can be linked to the shooting. He will be shot on the scene, or while he is trying to escape. While this is going on, the real assassin will slip away unnoticed. I have such a patsy in mind who is most conveniently available to us through our fellow patriots in the CIA. A few years ago the CIA set him up with a legend as a Communist defector. He is young and gullible enough to be duped into becoming our fall guy. His name is Lee Oswald. He is now working for the FBI in their COINTELPRO program. The advantages of Oswald being both CIA and FBI are obvious; it gives us an insurance policy for these agencies whose first impulse is to cover up their embarrassments. They will see immediately that the truth of the plot would destroy their organizations and themselves. They will cover up, we can be certain. Our plan will include a disinformation scheme in the months preceding the assassination to make it appear that Oswald is a fanatic who is connected to Fidel Castro. Most of the people who will conduct this disinformation scheme will not know its real purpose. They will think they are creating bona fides for our patsy to be a double agent in Cuba. The details of this will be worked out later but will include making it appear that he attempted to assassinate a prominent right-wing figure; that he talked of killing Kennedy on several occasions; that he tried to make contact with the Soviet and the Cuban consulates in Mexico City before the assassination; that he was seen around the locale in the days preceding the assassination practicing with his rifle and making himself obvious. This will be done with Oswald actively participating but not knowing that he is being set up. To help achieve this—there is a limit to how much we can maneuver Oswald without him catching on—we have another resource, who is an Oswald “look-alike.” These disinformation methods, of course, are commonplace; we have used them several times before. I plan to use some of our Cuban exile friends to help set up Oswald. By using Oswald, who is a CIA agent and who has been a subject in mind-control experiments, we have a double advantage. First (as I said), the CIA will be forced to participate in the cover-up; and, second, using the anti-Castro Cubans to set him up will provide us with an extra layer of deniability. We will further set up Oswald by inducing him to purchase a rifle through the mail that can easily be traced to him. We will plant this rifle in a “sniper’s nest” in a tall building overlooking the motorcade route. The first two shots will be diversionary shots and will come from the rear. The Secret Service agents and witnesses, upon hearing the first diversionary shot, will turn around and momentarily see a rifle sticking out of the window, diverting their attention from the front where the professional assassin will be located. The professional assassin in the front will shoot to kill with his first shot . If for some unforeseen reason he should miss, we will have a third assassin as a contingency back-up who will be located in the rear of the motorcade, but in a different building from the fake assassin. As an even further contingency, in case the third rifleman misses, we will have a fourth rifleman but again in the front, probably at the same location as the second rifleman. Bear in mind that we will use the best sharpshooters in the business. It is extremely unlikely that the first shot from the front will not do the job. In fact, we plan to set up a secret training camp to simulate exactly the conditions of vehicle speed, angles, and distance; and we will insist on our sharpshooters passing the test with perfect precision for at least one hundred times in succession before we proceed with the plan. For recruitment of the professional assassins, I plan to bring in trusted people from overseas, from our terrorist connections there. They are without doubt the best in the business and have a system of disinformation methods that make them virtually untraceable. I anticipate that our U.S. associates in the Outfit will furnish local personnel for handling the police and other minor assignments as needed. We will use our own trusted intelligence professionals as field coordinators and will have them in a central location that we control, with the necessary electronic communications."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"To be discussed later, I will develop an entire back-up plan— with equal care and thought—to be carried out on the same day, in the same city, in case our base plan should have to be aborted before it starts. I think we all realize that once our plan goes into operation—and we assemble all of our professional assassins, spotters, and coordinators in one city—there is no turning back. We must kill Kennedy that day and have Lyndon become president, for we cannot take the chance of a leak, considering all of the people necessary to make our plan work and the clues and signs of the operation that we believe must occur, no matter how carefully we try to plan otherwise. We absolutely must be in a position to suppress and control all evidence once Kennedy is gone. Only with Lyndon as president and Hoover as head of the FBI will that be possible. Since control of the evidence is crucial to our plan, a prime factor will be selecting the city where the assassination will take place. Some city in Texas might end up being our best possibility because, as we well know by experience, Texas has a long history of coroners for hire and it’s Lyndon’s territory. Also, by law in the state of Texas the autopsy and evidence must stay in Texas, even if it is the murder of the president. Our people in Texas can insist on the autopsy being done locally. In that same vein, it will be necessary for us to have some minimum level of control of the local police in the city that is selected. This, you realize, is no problem because our partners, once Hoover is aboard, have control of the police in all of the proposed locations, particularly in Dallas. There are numerous other details that will have to be worked out, such as bullet and shell casing plants (the logistics and number that need to be planted), linking of bullets to the fake assassin’s rifle, etc. But these are routine matters that we have employed many times in our previous operations. Two last items—important ones—are that we will need to work out a way to control the physical evidence and create laxity in the protection of the president. I have in mind bribing key personnel in the Secret Service to see that we have control of these two items. The Secret Service personnel who guard Kennedy have become disenchanted with him. They have lost all respect and are sick of covering for him in his outrageous and reckless escapades. They are paid only a measly few hundred dollars per month. The prospects of $500,000 each will be irresistible. These bribes, along with the money required to hire professional assassins, will take a large amount of cash. My preliminary estimate is $10 million. Although this may seem excessive, we must remember that the payoff will be a thousand fold. Ten million is really peanuts. It should not be a problem with the resources available to us through our wealthy backers and our hidden funds. We must, of course, have all cash in untraceable bills. That, gentlemen, is our plan. Your comments will be appreciated. We will now have an open discussion. Also, I should add, we should consider having a complete military takeover of the government in case our plan should blow. I’m working on some thoughts of how this could be put into action on a contingency basis. Basically the plan will include the threat of nuclear war with the Soviets as an excuse for martial law. As mentioned, we will be in a position to blame the assassination on the Cubans or the Soviets. I will present that plan to you at our next meeting. Plausible deniability will, as always, be the cornerstone of our plan. Thank you. * * * To complete the foregoing, I was forced to put myself in the place of the assassination planner and think through a workable plan in which the elements fit into the known evidence. [39] The people who planned and participated in the assassination, although “rational,” must have been driven by desperation combined with an acute case of arrogance and overwhelming personal ambition; and the planners must have been very much accustomed to conceiving and carrying out complex, bold plots. This fits U.S. intelligence and the Mafia to a tee. My hypothesis is that the primary motivation of the key conspirators was one of self-survival to prevent themselves from being annihilated by the Kennedy brothers, whom"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"they hated. It fits this scenario. In the following chapters I will summarize the results of my investigation of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. We will see if the foregoing scenario fairly describes the events and circumstances and is borne out by the evidence. If not, a scenario will be developed that does fit, without clinging to previous assumptions. If the perfect crime is defined as one in which the criminals all got away with it, then the assassination of John F. Kennedy was the perfect crime. The conspirators indeed conceived the perfect plot. They got away with it, although many things went wrong. The reason they got away with it is that they had the power to control the investigation and to seal away any evidence that they could not destroy, change, or manipulate. As a general guideline, I decided to look for things that appeared to have gone wrong which might reveal the nature of the plot and the identity of the conspirators. I wrote down the following as a starting list: -- People started talking and bragging about the assassination well before it took place: Joseph Milteer, Carlos Marcello, Jimmy Hoffa, and Santo Trafficante. -- The Oswald-impersonator scheme was carried off badly. “Oswald” showed up in two places at the same time on several occasions. -- The planted bullet was a transparent fake. It was too perfect to be believed. -- Perhaps the biggest mistake of all: Oswald was supposed to escape and be eliminated, or be shot trying to escape, but the plan went awry. He was arrested instead and had to be shot by Jack Ruby (who was obviously connected to the Mafia according to telephone records found in his apartment). This threw the whole plan into disarray and panic. -- The Kennedy staff and family insisted that the body be taken back to Washington, preventing the autopsy from being performed in Texas and forcing an unplanned autopsy in Washington, D.C. I reasoned that the things gone wrong must have created enormous problems for the conspirators. By following these leads, it might be possible to reveal the nature of the conspiracy. My next step would be to develop precise methods of evaluating the evidence—a very important subject—and then get into the details of the evidence. "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"PART 2: MURDER AND COVER-UP"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"“Goddamn the Kennedys,” I heard Clyde Tolson say to Hoover. “First there was Jack, now there’s Bobby, and then Teddy. We’ll have them on our necks until the year 2000.” And the director nodded in agreement. William C. Sullivan, Former Assistant to J. Edgar Hoover, The Bureau: My Thirty Years in Hoover’s FBI 9 QUESTIONS OF EVIDENCE I urge the reader to bear with me in this chapter concerning the use of evidence. This is a very important subject if we are to keep our bearings while maneuvering through the JFK assassination quagmire. In attempting to understand the evidence in this case, I was immediately confronted with the dilemma of how to interpret the massive amount of information that is available in millions of pages of documents and taped interviews. It was soon apparent that a methodology was needed to sort the most pertinent material down to a manageable quantity and rationally evaluate the quality and importance of each item. I was obliged to accept the reality that no evidence, in this or any other complex crime, is of absolute certainty. There is always some uncertainty—doubts can be raised about any item of evidence if one is willing to search long enough. In point of fact, this is the very method used by trial attorneys: Their first order of business is to create doubts in the minds of the judge or the jury. In practice, many lawyers, even prominent trial attorneys, unabashedly manufacture doubt out of thin air, to the point of lies, obfuscating facts to the point that the jurors are overwhelmed and their verdict is based on sentiment and emotions. This can lead to hung juries or acquittals, even in cases that are replete with irrefutable evidence of guilt. A prime example was the O. J. Simpson trial in Los Angeles in 1995. Even Pulitzer Prize-winning authors such as Norman Mailer become confused when facing the mountain of conflicting evidence that has accumulated in the JFK assassination. In a feature article in the San Diego Union on May 14, 1995, Mailer discussed his recently published book, Oswald’s Tale : Did Oswald do it? If one’s answer is to come out of anything larger than an opinion, it is necessary to contend with questions of evidence. In that direction, however, one encounters a jungle of facts and expert estimates as to whether Oswald could fire the shots in time, was a good enough marksman, was the only gunman in Dealey Plaza, and on one can go, trying to explore into every last reach of possibility, only to encounter a disheartening truth: Evidence, by itself, will never provide the answer to a mystery. For it is in the nature of evidence to produce, sooner or later, a counter- interpretation to itself in the form of a contending expert in a court of law. Mailer here is leading up to confessing that he resorted to mere opinion in his massive book on Oswald. The evidence, to Mailer, is too difficult—thus ignore it! After all, he says, what’s the point? Any evidence that will be developed will only be refuted, so why bother with it? Mailer confirmed his intellectual capitulation in an interview on Larry King Live when answering a question from a viewer as to how Oswald could have gotten from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository to the second floor in one and a half minutes. Mailer, in seriousness, answered that Oswald must have had a “ transcendental experience! ” Mailer thus wrote his 800-page book without ever coming to grips with any substantial evidence whatsoever. All he provided were fanciful avenues of escape for those who cannot logically refute the evidence of a conspiracy. In the end, Mailer came up with the nonsense that he thought there was a 75 percent chance that Oswald acted alone. He then hedged and said that Oswald would never have been convicted in a jury trial if he, Mailer, were defending Oswald. Of what value is that? I want a much more definitive answer. It therefore becomes necessary to develop means of dealing with the evidence. After some thought, I concluded that despite its obvious flaws and shortcomings, the method of presenting and evaluating"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"evidence that has been developed over many generations in our legal system is the best that we have. It has been forged out of the heat of debate between adversaries, guided by our constitution, and grapples with reality. It uses scientific evidence combined with opinions, intuitions, circumstances, and eyewitness accounts. Virtually anything that can help to understand the crime can be brought to bear, if the judge permits. A purely scientific method by itself has the shortcoming that there is always doubt. And the scientific method does not deal with the moral dilemma and agony of the juror, who despite painful doubts has to weigh the evidence, overcome the doubt, and finally, hopefully, reach a decision in which somebody will either be set free or punished. Our legal system combines logic, argumentation, fairness, and scientific knowledge in a debate between advocates. Many times juries fail, but no other system has been proven better. As I progressed in my research, I learned about the legal concept of best evidence that says only the clearest and most credible evidence should be presented by an advocate to prove his or her case, and only to the extent necessary to make the case; all other evidence is discarded. There is a point at which one must stop considering every scintilla of evidence that presents itself; otherwise the case can never be made; it will collapse under its own weight. This is a fundamental concept for the prosecution of a criminal case. This concept, simple in principle and so essential if I were to hope to complete a readable book, proved to be very difficult to apply to the JFK assassination because there is a super-abundance of evidence. I found, time and again, the painful necessity of stopping short of tying each chapter into a neat package, with no loose ends. Thus there will be loose ends, which I shall identify as clearly as I can. The best evidence is considered to be the evidence that is most certain: For example, photographic evidence (that has not been tampered with) is generally considered better evidence than oral testimonies. But, of course, it is possible to tamper with photographic evidence to the extent that the deception is virtually undetectable. And as will be seen as critical in this case, evidence that has been forged, by those who are prime suspects in the crime, is tantamount to proof of their guilt. Oral testimony given under oath, under cross-examination, is generally considered better than interviews or written statements. The first and freshest oral testimony is generally better than later testimony. This is important when people testify and then change their story. The first testimony is considered superior—but not always; sometimes memories really do become more factual with time. Scientific evidence backed by experts is generally considered better than oral testimony; yet scientific evidence can be tainted by the biases—or outright dishonesty—of the scientist making the case. And many jurors simply cannot deal with scientific evidence. Dealing rationally with evidence is hard work. It takes a soul-searching, analytical person capable of change and of suspending many conflicting ideas in the mind for extended periods of time. In using legal methods of evaluating evidence, I want to dispel any notion that I hold an illusion that a legal trial will ever take place. Most of the alleged participants in this crime are now dead, so a trial cannot take place; only a few subordinates are still living. Also, much of the evidence would be held inadmissible because the “chain of possession” rules have been violated in many instances. What is at stake is historical truth . I hope I will be able to convince the reader that historical truth is a very important subject for the long-term survival of the nation. I don’t think I have to argue that it is extremely perilous to our nation if a political group can, by assassination, bypass a democratic election for the presidency; and, worse yet, if they can get away with it. As earlier noted, the vast body of evidence and information concerning Kennedy’s assassination requires great reduction and selection to bring it to an understandable level. Fortunately, much of this has already been done by numerous researchers and condensed into excellent books and documents. I drew on what I consider to be the best of these references and further condensed that work. In addition, I conducted my own investigations and research in the National Archives in which I"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"discovered new, important documents. I also was fortunate to find and develop original material, including analysis of the motion pictures and photographs taken at the scene of the crime, and interviews with key witnesses and government officials who are still alive. FBI reports, Secret Service reports, and documents from the CIA were utilized as they became available under Freedom of Information Act lawsuits and Acts of Congress. One further source of evidence—unique to the JFK case—is the hundreds of hours of television and radio programs in which witnesses have been interviewed and recorded. I considered that the vast amount of this material should not be taken lightly in view of the fact that the government of the United States has never allowed the American people to witness a serious trial with the best evidence, and a legitimate judge and a jury to weigh it. It became apparent to me that I needed to know much more about legal rules of evidence and judicial procedures. I thought I had a fair concept of direct evidence, but the legal definitions of “hearsay” and “circumstantial evidence” were not clear to me, and I didn’t have a clear idea of the legal terms “reasonable doubt” and “preponderance of evidence.” I borrowed law books from an attorney friend and found that most of what I needed to know was in Gilberts Law Summaries by John Kaplan and Jon R. Waltz. I found that there are two basic types of evidence as distinguished from forms of evidence. The first type is direct evidence , sometimes simplistically termed “eyewitness” evidence, which proves a proposition directly (in one step) rather than by inference. Second is indirect, or circumstantial, evidence which is evidence that depends on inferences for its relationship to the material issue to be proved: It is evidence of a related fact from which the existence of an ultimate fact can be inferred. Circumstantial evidence is far more prevalent in courtrooms than many realize. For example, fingerprints are circumstantial evidence, as is DNA analysis; but circumstantial evidence can vary from this virtually irrefutable evidence to broad circumstantial evidence encompassing motive, means, and opportunity. There is a very wide spectrum of circumstantial evidence that can be admitted by the judge. Although the term “circumstantial evidence” is held in low esteem by the lay public, it should be noted that legal scholars consider it to be superior to testimonial evidence because circumstances are very difficult to forge; whereas in direct testimonies people can lie or be telling what they believe to be the truth, yet have gross misconceptions of what they saw or heard. There are many ways in which experienced criminals or professionals, such as government intelligence, can create illusions of certainty of evidence when it is, in fact, a fraud. This applies in particular to conspiracies where careful advance planning took place and, worse yet, in which, literally, magician’s tricks were employed. For these reasons the law is inclined to admit broad circumstantial evidence in conspiracy cases. Eyewitness accounts are almost invariably admissible in court. Most of the rules excluding evidence relate to circumstantial evidence. In cases of conspiracy, juries like to see a plausible, cohesive theory of both the broad and specific aspects of the crime. Gilberts points out three basic forms of evidence: First is testimonial evidence given by a witness; second is tangible evidence —exhibits or tangible things that may be offered for consideration. Tangible evidence is divided into real evidence —the “real thing,” for example the murder weapon, bullets, a movie film of actual events, a written document, etc.—and demonstrative evidence , which is not the real item involved in the case but rather is a visual or audiovisual aid. Such evidence includes a model, a chart, or a diagram. It also includes scientific evidence. Admissibility of evidence in court is determined solely by the trial judge. On the other hand, the weight and credibility of evidence are up to the jury to decide. Unless objections are made, almost any kind of evidence can be received in court. The most often-"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"rejected evidence by the judge is broad circumstantial and hearsay evidence. Hearsay is defined in Gilberts as “oral testimony or documentary evidence as to somebody’s (either the testifying witness’ or someone else’s) words or actions outside of court, where they are offered to prove the truth of the very matters they assert.” Hearsay is generally found non-admissible, but it is not widely known that there are numerous exceptions. Admissible hearsay is discussed in Gilberts: “...there are many situations in which evidence, although hearsay, is held admissible. In these situations, the public policies rejecting hearsay evidence are simply outweighed by other policies favoring its admission. There is no single theory or rationale that will explain all of the exceptions or harmonize one with another. However, Wigmore, by classifying reported testimony and admissions as non-hearsay, found in every recognized exception the following elements: (a) some necessity for using the hearsay evidence (usually the death or unavailability of the declarant); and (b) something in its content or in the circumstances of its utterance which serves to guarantee its trustworthiness.” Similarly, Morgan observed, “The test of admissibility should be (a) whether the hearsay is such that the trier can put a reasonable accurate value upon it as evidence of the matter it is offered to prove, and (b) whether direct testimony of the declarant is unavailable or, if available, is likely to be less reliable. The number of exceptions to the hearsay rule is by no means fixed or rigid. New exceptions continue to be created by statute or case law, reflecting the ever-increasing awareness that hearsay evidence is valuable, and, in certain situations, may even be the best evidence available....” I noted that the use of hearsay evidence should be particularly appropriate in the JFK case, but only if it met strict tests: strong reason to believe it is true, the prime suspect unavailable (dead or won’t talk), and overriding public interest. Confessions by the accused are not hearsay, according to Federal Rules. This is noted in Gilberts : (1) Federal Rules: [§] Admissions and confessions are not hearsay under the Federal Rules (supra, §248). Nonetheless, most courts have regarded confessions as hearsay, but they are, nevertheless, admissible: (2) Majority view: [§342] Most courts, however, regard an extrajudicial confession as hearsay, since it is offered to prove the truth of the matter confessed. However, like an admission, its probative value outweighs any hearsay objections, and hence it is admissible under a long- recognized exception to the Hearsay Rule. The rules governing confessions are significant in the JFK case because of numerous witnesses to confessions or near confessions (of either direct involvement or fringe involvement) by mobsters Sam Giancana, Santo Trafficante, Jr., Carlos Marcello, and possibly others such as David Sanchez Morales, Robert Morrow, Richard Case Nagell, and Gerald Patrick Hemming, all of whom are discussed in later chapters. The legal term reasonable doubt is a very important concept in evaluating evidence. It is the mainstay of the criminal justice system. A succinct definition of reasonable doubt is in the book Shadow of a Doubt [40] by Federal Judge William J. Caughlin: A reasonable doubt is a fair doubt, growing out of the testimony, the lack of testimony, or the unsatisfactory nature of the testimony. It is not a mere imaginary or possible doubt , but a fair doubt based on reason and common sense . It is such a doubt as to leave your minds, after a careful examination of the evidence, in the condition that you cannot say you have an abiding conviction amounting to a moral certainty [41] of the truth of the charge made against the defendant."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" The reasonable-doubt standard is considered by the legal system to be the highest standard. It is an attempt to make certain that the scales of evidence are decisively balanced against the accused before he or she can be convicted of a criminal offense. I noted that the reasonable-doubt standard is intended to cut both ways . The accused should not be convicted if there is a reasonable doubt of the truth of the charges or the validity of the evidence; but, on the other hand, the accused should not be acquitted because of imaginary or possible doubts that can always be concocted in any issue—a very important point in the JFK case. Over the years, critics of pro- conspiracy evidence have demonstrated that they will stop at nothing to create “reasonable doubt” out of imaginary doubt to avoid facing the truth of a conspiracy. Despite overwhelming doubt of the validity of the Warren Commission’s arguments for a lone gunman, pro-Warren Commission people have kept possible doubts of a conspiracy alive for almost thirty years by using imaginary doubts or insignificant discrepancies in pro-conspiracy evidence. This is true of virtually every item of evidence that has been developed. It is immediately attacked and dissected, and shadows of doubt expostulated, keeping the minds of the American people in a state of confusion. In fact, some of the best researchers—who believe that there was a conspiracy—fall into this trap by deliberately taking an extremely skeptical viewpoint of each new item, demanding proof to the point of an absolute certainty before they accept it into the body of evidence. Scientists know (or should know) that it is impossible to prove anything beyond any possible doubt. Even Newton’s law is still a theory and, in fact, was proven “wrong” by Albert Einstein. There is always uncertainty about any item of evidence, perhaps infinitesimal, but always there is some degree of uncertainty. For these reasons, reasonable doubt can often backfire on the prosecution (or the defense) because many jurors are not capable of comprehending the nuances of the concept, and they confuse a remotely possible doubt with a reasonable doubt—thus we have hung juries or outrageous acquittals. Preponderance of the evidence is a legal concept that is an alternative to reasonable-doubt standards. It is generally applied to civil cases in which only a weighing of evidence is necessary. If the scales of justice tip one way or the other, the accused may be declared guilty or innocent. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy defined “preponderance of the evidence” as meaning “more likely so than not so—more probable than improbable.” [42] One trial attorney (who has pled a case before the U.S. Supreme Court and with whom I discussed this) felt that preponderance-of-evidence standards should be applied to the JFK assassination because the crime is so important to the nation and because conspiratorial crimes are so difficult to solve. This is true particularly when the criminals may have controlled the FBI. A third standard of proof, clear and convincing evidence, is that quantum of evidence beyond a mere preponderance, but below that of “beyond a reasonable doubt,” and such that “it will produce in the mind of the trier a firm belief as to the facts sought to be established” (Steven H. Gifts, Barrons Legal Guides, Law Dictionary ). Thus we have available three levels of proof for forming our judgments or lay opinions in the JFK case. It has been extremely difficult (thus far impossible) for individuals without prosecutorial powers to solve the JFK case. Most of the real progress that has been made is by use of testimonies and evidence gathered by the Warren Commission, the Senate Intelligence Committee, and the House Select Committee on Assassinations. But, as might be expected, all of these government bodies were unwilling to carry forward, or were blocked by the government bureaucracy from investigating the government itself. Therefore, I decided that it was reasonable and justifiable to use preponderance-of-evidence standards in those instances in my study in which reasonable-doubt or clear-and-convincing standards were perhaps not present, but the body of evidence, when examined as a whole, met preponderance-of-evidence standards."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"One last point: The law says that a person is presumed innocent until found guilty in a court of law. But it should be realized that this is a concept only applicable in a courtroom . It doesn’t mean that an individual has to follow the same rule—only the law is so constrained. As individuals, we have the right to form our own judgments at any point in time we become convinced, one way or the other. Moreover, we may disagree with the decisions of a jury or a judge (who are by no means infallible). And, in the case of the JFK assassination, we certainly are not compelled to accept the proclamations of politically motivated tribunals. As I studied the Warren Commission Report and its twenty-six volumes, and later the HSCA Reports and their appendices, it soon became apparent that neither the Commission nor the Committee had used a standard of discipline to control its efforts. They had completely disregarded legal concepts—and even disregarded the most tried-and-true methods of classic criminology—the analysis of motive, means, and opportunity. As congressionally authorized bodies they were free to impose impossibly high standards when it came to establishing proof of conspiracy, particularly if it involved the federal government. At the same time they were free to accept ridiculously low standards when it came to establishing the lone- assassin hypothesis. They were also free to disregard any evidence that did not fit into their political agenda, or bury it in the National Archives for seventy years. Is it little wonder that the results they produced were so flawed? This only underscored my determination to apply appropriate standards, insofar as possible, to my analysis of the evidence. We will now go deeply into the evidence and its fascinating detail. This is the greatest murder mystery in American history, if not of all time. It is best approached as an intellectual puzzle—the solving of a mystery—in a manner that is as objective as one is capable of. My first goal will be to develop clear and convincing forensic and scientific evidence that there was, in fact, a conspiracy that assassinated John F. Kennedy. The fact of a conspiracy may be taken for granted by many, but my research forced me to conclude, reluctantly, that it was necessary to take a fresh look at the basic foundation of the evidence and clarify many uncertainties as to whether or not it supports the conclusion of conspiracy. Only then could I develop broader circumstantial evidence of the master conspiracy. We therefore must pause for a while and go back to square one. Although what follows is arcane, it is very critical because it points distinctive arrows in the direction of the prime conspirators."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 10 THE NUMBER OF GUNMEN In this chapter my primary objective is to develop evidence to prove that there was more than one gunman at Dealey Plaza: that at least one of the shots was fired from the front or right—or not from the east end of the sixth-floor Texas School Book Depository Building which was in the rear. This will have the goal of laying a minimal foundation that there was a conspiracy consisting of at least two people. It will be the first step in building the proof of a major sophisticated conspiracy involving several people. The Zapruder film will be used in this chapter only as supporting evidence of shots that occurred and as one of the constraints on the Warren Commission. The chapter that follows will provide evidence that the Zapruder film was altered while in the hands of the FBI, therefore implicating the U.S. government in the conspiracy. The evidence that there was more than one gunman at Dealey Plaza can be extremely complicated and requires a considerable analytical effort if one wants to understand it in its ultimate detail and subtleties. But if one is willing to accept a common-sense view, it need not be all that difficult. From the beginning it seemed extremely dubious, with only the slightest scrutiny, that one crazed gunman with a twenty-five- dollar World War I vintage Italian rifle, with single-bolt action and a misaligned telescopic sight, could have performed the remarkable feat of high-speed firing and marksmanship to hit a moving target 270 feet away—which would have been required for the single-gunman hypothesis to be valid. After all, expert marksmen in FBI tests were unable to duplicate the feat."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Dealey Plaza and adjoining areas.

The answer is that nothing more would probably be required in a legitimate trial in a courtroom before an intelligent, unprejudiced jury. But a more in-depth understanding is required for a crime of the profound magnitude of this presidential assassination. So we will now plunge into the extensive evidence, with its nuances and complexities, that devastates the idea of the lone assassin. By so doing, the groundwork will be laid for deducing from the evidence at Dealey Plaza—projecting backward in time—the amazing composition of the master conspiracy. The Number of Bullets An overview of the evidence examining virtually [43] all of the gunshots can be achieved by reviewing the following table. This is a summary of the tangible and testimonial evidence of shots, bullets, or fragments of bullets that struck either Kennedy, Connally, or inanimate objects. (All exhibits for this chapter are at the end of the chapter. Frames of the Zapruder film are in the color section.) Notes: Shot number not in time sequence! Evidence ignores acoustical data. Shot No. 1 : Location —JFK head wound Evidence —Zapruder film; eyewitness testimonies; autopsy photo Shot No. 2: Location —JFK throat wound, identified as an entrance wound by Dallas doctors Evidence —Zapruder frame 224, 225; eyewitness testimonies; autopsy report; news report Shot No. 3: Location —Connally’s five wounds (assumed to be caused by one bullet) Evidence —Connally’s medical examination; his testimony; Zapruder film; autopsy report Shot No. 4: Location —JFK back wound (5 ½ inches below collar line, identified by Bethesda doctors as a shallow wound, 2 to 3 inches deep at 45 to 65 degrees downward angle) Evidence —Photographs of jacket and shirt; testimonies of Dr. Pierre Finck, Paul O’Connor, Secret Service agents, FBI agents; autopsy diagrams (see Exhibits 10-7, 10-8, and 10-11).

Vol. VII, pp. 552-558 Shot No. 9: Location —Bullet hitting windshield of president’s limousine Evidence —FBI photographs; eyewitness testimonies (see Exhibit 10-5) Shot No. 10 : Location —Dent in chrome trim of windshield of president’s limousine Evidence —FBI photograph (see Exhibit 10-5) The above list does not include two large bullet fragments found on the floorboard of the front seat of the president’s limousine; or an intact bullet (see Exhibit 10-10) presumably found on John Connally’s stretcher at Parkland Hospital; or an intact bullet reportedly found in the wrappings of the president’s body by Navy Captain David Osborne during the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital. These bullets could possibly be the cause of, or have resulted from, the above list of ten shots. Also, in this same category, two bullet fragments were reportedly removed from Kennedy’s body during the autopsy, and a third fragment was claimed to have been lodged in his skull. For the single-gunman hypothesis of the Warren Commission Report to be valid (using the evidence provided to them by Hoover’s FBI) there can be only three shots, based first on the evidence presented that only three “empty” cartridges were found. It was accepted by the Warren Commission that an assassin would not have, in any believable scenario, picked up one or more cartridges and left three. A second criteria of the Warren Commission that must be met for their lone-gunman hypothesis to be valid is that the time between shots must be 2.3 seconds or more, based on the minimum time established by FBI tests to reload, quickly aim, and fire the rifle. (WCR, p. 97) A third criteria of the Warren Commission was that the Zapruder film was an infallible instrument for measurement of the time spacing between the shots. In this chapter I will use only the first criteria of shot count to make my initial case, along with the evidence of the angle and depth of the wounds. The second criteria (shot timing) will be discussed in the following chapter, but will not be used as conclusive evidence because it is my contention that frames were removed from the Zapruder film, making all timing evidence questionable insofar as rapidity of gun firing is concerned, and invalidating the Commission’s third criteria. As a further point in analyzing this list, it should be realized that almost all ballistic evidence and ear- witness testimony at the crime scene must be viewed skeptically in a highly sophisticated conspiracy, such as might be carried out by those having knowledge of or access to government intelligence. By 1963, the CIA and military intelligence agencies had developed the use of such exotica as miniature machine guns with silencers (mounted in cameras) and other sophisticated assassination methods, which either make it impossible to trace bullets back to any gun, or make it possible for markings of bullets fired from several rifles all to trace back to one rifle. [44] This makes almost anything possible. It greatly complicates the issue if we are seriously to consider that individuals from military intelligence or the CIA were involved in the conspiracy. As mentioned before, over the past thirty years there have been endless debates over how to prove that there was more than one gunman at Dealey Plaza. The simplest way I found was to narrow down the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"foregoing list of ten shots to an absolute minimum. If that number exceeds the Commission’s criteria of three shots, there must have been a second gunman. Here is my absolute minimum (again, not in a time sequence): Shot 1 : JFK’s fatal head shot. This is at least one shot, perhaps two, but I will count it as one. Shot 2 : JFK’s wound in the throat: a small round hole, initially described by the attending physicians at Parkland Hospital, including Dr. Malcolm Perry (who described it on CBS television), as a wound of entry. Shot 3 : Connally’s five wounds. I will concede that all five could have been caused by one bullet, although this is by no means a certainty. Shot 4 : JFK’s back wound, as matched by the bullet holes in his jacket and shirt. Shot 5 : Shot that missed. This is agreed upon by virtually all researchers and was also accepted by the Warren Commission. Shot 6 : Bullet found in grass near location of fatal shot. Six is greater than three. Therefore, JFK was assassinated by at least a conspiracy of two people. With this seemingly irrefutable evidence of a second gunman, one might ask how the Warren Commission arrived at three shots. Here is how they did it, with the help of their ingenious lawyer, the ubiquitous Arlen Specter, lately a candidate for the presidency of the United States: (1) They said, quite arbitrarily, that shots 2, 3, and 4 were all caused by one bullet. To do this they had to ignore the indisputable evidence of the low, shallow back wound, as well as myriad other items of evidence, including the sworn testimonies of John and Nellie Connally, the timing evidence in the Zapruder film (which they accepted as valid), and the FBI firing tests. They also had to assume that the bullet found on the stretcher in Parkland Hospital was the bullet that shattered Connally’s rib and wrist bones, despite the fact that the person who found that bullet disputed their assumption of where he found it, and despite the fact that the bullet was in an almost perfect condition, with no measurable weight loss, had no traces of blood on it, did not account for the weight of lead fragments present in Connally’s leg bone as evidenced by x-rays, and had only a slight flattening at its base. This bullet would be dubbed the “magic bullet” by skeptics. (See Exhibits 10-9a, 10-9b, and 10-10 for more detail on this important subject.) By this willfully capricious combining of shots 2, 3, and 4 into one shot, the Commission now needed only two shots to account for the minimum conceivable wounds on both Kennedy and Connally; they had one shot to spare. They assumed that this shot missed. (2) They explained away all the remaining shots by either attributing them to fragments from the fatal head shot, or the one shot that had missed. When these possibilities ran out they simply ignored the evidence by not mentioning it in their report. (For example, they completely ignored shot 6, the bullet found in the grass 300 feet away from the School Book Depository near the location of the fatal shot, despite photographs in newspapers and eyewitness testimonies to its validity.) By making all these arbitrary assumptions, Arlen Specter had set the ground rules. From that point forward the seemingly irrefutable evidence became obfuscated. Such are the ways of lawyers to scramble the truth. Now, only the most dedicated researchers would go through the analytical process of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the staff of the Warren Commission had rigged the evidence. It was apparent that the evidence of the location and nature of the back wound would be the crucial test in establishing proof that Arlen Specter’s hypothecations were without any foundation whatsoever. I found it helpful to prepare a sketch showing the basic geometry."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" In this diagram, point “X” is the location of the back wound as evidenced by the bullet holes in the jacket and shirt. Line A-B is the path the bullet would travel if it were fired from a rifle from the sixth floor of the School Book Depository—about a twenty-degree angle above the horizontal. The bullet would have exited from JFK’s chest, but there was no evidence of a wound in the front of his chest. Line C-D is the path of the bullet required for it to exit from the throat if it entered at point “X” and passed through the body. But probing of the wound in the autopsy showed that it did not pass through the body. Moreover, this path was obviously not possible unless a bullet were fired from the trunk of the limousine, or from street level; but there was no evidence that such a shot occurred. Line E-F is the path of the bullet required for it to exit from the throat if fired from the sixth floor of the School Book Depository. This obviously requires that there be an entrance wound in the back of JFK’s neck, about five inches higher than evidenced by the bullet holes in the clothing. There was no such wound observed by personnel at Parkland Hospital or any other witnesses. (In a later chapter evidence will be presented that the wording of the autopsy report was arbitrarily changed, after Kennedy’s body was taken from the autopsy room, to describe an entrance wound in the back of the neck on line E-F. Proponents of a lone-gunman scenario have all started with the assumption that the written report of the autopsy was correct, thus forcing them to ignore all of the voluminous tangible evidence to the contrary.) Listed below are specific items of evidence concerning the back wound that demand closer examination: 1) The bullet holes in the jacket and shirt showing location of the wound. 2) The testimony of Secret Service agents concerning location of the wound. 3) The testimonies of FBI agents concerning location of the wound. 4) The testimonies concerning depth of the wound. In addition, the testimonies of John and Nellie Connally are of great importance because they both testified adamantly that Kennedy was hit by a bullet and, an instant after that, John Connally was hit by a separate bullet. Their testimonies, in themselves, nullify the Warren Commission’s hypothesis that the same bullet which struck Kennedy in the back also struck John Connally, and in so doing are evidence of a second gunman, and therefore evidence of a conspiracy. [45] An analysis of each of these items follows. Bullet Holes in JFK’s Jacket and Shirt "},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Bullet holes in clothing of gunshot victims are considered prime evidence in forensic science. This applies in particular, in this case, where Kennedy had a custom-made jacket and shirt, and where photographs taken during the actual crime showed them to be in a normal position on his back. In Gerald Posner’s highly publicized book Case Closed, Posner had a serious problem dealing with the evidence of the bullet holes in the jacket and shirt. He lamely inserted this footnote for a paragraph entitled “The Neck Wound:” There was also some question as to why the location of the entry wound at the rear base of the President’s neck is several inches higher than is indicated by the bullet holes in his suit jacket and shirt. Photographs taken during the motorcade show the President’s jacket was often bunched and riding up his back as a result of his waving to the crowd. His back brace also pushed his clothing up. Therefore, measuring placement of the holes in the clothing is not an accurate means of determining precisely where the bullet entered the body. Posner, Case Closed, p. 305 I would soon see that this is typical of the way Posner and virtually all proponents of a lone gunman dismiss this prime evidence that demolishes their theory. Posner states in his footnote that “Photographs taken during the motorcade show the President’s jacket was often bunched....” This statement is patently not true. At no point near or at the possible time of the occurrence of the back wound do photographs show the jacket bunched, let alone the shirt. On the contrary, photographs show the jacket was not bunched. This can be seen in Exhibit 10-1 and in Zapruder frame 228. In fact, no one has ever produced a single photograph or film showing the jacket bunched except possibly after the fatal head wound when Kennedy had collapsed; and we should keep in mind that we are talking about a large amount of bunching —five inches—and with the shirt bunching the exact same amount as the jacket; and without either the jacket or shirt folding over, which would have resulted in double holes in the fabric. Posner said in his footnote that “his back brace also pushed his clothing up.” This is a misleading statement. There is not a scintilla of evidence that the back brace “pushed his clothing up.” When I learned more about the back brace, it became apparent that the notion that it pushed up the clothing to the extent required was without merit. I referred to the Warren Commission Report and easily found all one needs to know about Kennedy’s back brace. It was only six inches wide and only waist high, no higher than the navel. Posner’s footnote is the total argument of lone-gunman proponents to deal with the bullet holes in Kennedy’s clothing. Posner is simply repeating what others had said before. The truth is that there has never been a credible argument to dismiss the photographs of the bullet holes in the jacket and shirt. The conclusion is inescapable: The bullet holes in the clothing do, in fact, show the true location of the back wound . That conclusion is buttressed by eyewitness testimonies. Eyewitness Testimonies Concerning Location of Back Wound Two Secret Service agents wrote reports concerning the location of the back wound. Agent Glenn Bennett, who was riding in the follow-up car behind the president’s limousine, wrote in his statement to the Warren Commission (see Exhibit 10-1): At this point I heard what sounded like a firecracker. I immediately looked from the right/crowd/physical area/and looked towards the President who was seated in the right rear seat of his limousine open convertible. At the moment I looked at the back of the President I heard another firecracker noise and saw the shot hit the President about four inches down from the right shoulder."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" W.C. Vol. XVIII, p. 760 (Emphasis added) Secret Service agent Clinton Hill, Jacqueline Kennedy’s body-guard—chosen by her at the last minute before departing for Dallas, and the only agent to respond to do his duty when the shots were fired— wrote a memorandum concerning his final view of the body at 2:45 a.m. in the Naval Hospital morgue: I was requested by ASAIC Kellerman to come to the morgue to once again view the body. When I arrived the autopsy had been completed and ASAIC Kellerman, SA Greer, General McHugh and I viewed the wounds. I observed a wound about six inches down from the neckline on the back just to the right of the spinal column. I observed another wound on the right rear portion of the skull. Attendants of the Joseph Gawler Mortuary were at this time preparing the body for placement in the casket. W.C. Vol. XVIII, p. 744 (Emphasis added) James W. Sibert and Francis X. O’Neill, who were the FBI representatives at the autopsy, wrote a detailed report dated November 26, 1963 about what they observed at the autopsy. The back wound was described: During the latter stages of this autopsy, Dr. Humes located an opening which appeared to be a bullet hole which was below the shoulders and two inches to the right of the middle line of the spinal column. This opening was probed by Dr. Humes with the finger, at which time it was determined that the trajectory of the missile entering at this point had entered at a downward position of 45 to 60 degrees. Further probing determined that the distance traveled by this missile was a short distance inasmuch as the end of the opening could be felt with the finger. FD 302, Federal Bureau of Investigation (Emphasis added) In this single report, the FBI agents clearly documented the location of the back wound as “below the shoulder,” the opening shallow—no more than a finger length—and the bullet entering at a downward angle. This evidence was reinforced in a newly released document from the National Archives which was discovered by Anna Marie. Attached to an interview of James Sibert by the HSCA (during its investigation in 1977) were sketches made by Sibert of the location of the back wound that he observed in the morgue. (See Exhibit 10-2.) This evidence leaves no doubt as to Sibert’s view of the location of the back wound. Note in the sketch on the left that the back wound is well below the collar line . Of particular note is the sketch on the right showing the back wound well below the neck wound, remarkably similar to line C-D in my sketch of the geometry of the wounds. (Incidentally, I made my sketch based on the bullet holes in the clothing before I noticed the similarity to Sibert’s sketch.) Admiral George Burkley, who was the personal physician to President Kennedy and was present at the autopsy, prepared a death certificate dated November 23, 1963 in which he stated that “a second wound occurred in the posterior back at about the location of the third thoracic vertebrae.” In adult, normal-size humans this is invariably about five or six inches below the neckline, corroborating the FBI agents’ report and Clinton Hill’s testimony, and agreeing exactly with the location of the bullet holes in the clothing. Admiral Burkley was never called to testify before the Warren Commission, despite his having been the only medical person present at the crime scene who was also present at Parkland Hospital in Dallas and was present during the entire time of the autopsy at Bethesda. Even the Warren Commission was on record, buried in the National Archives, indicating the location of the back wound as being below the elevation of the throat wound. In a document classified TOP SECRET, dated January 27, 1964, obtained in a Freedom of Information lawsuit by Harold Weisberg, was the transcript of a meeting held by the Warren Commission. In this transcript was a statement by"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"General Counsel J. Lee Rankin: Mr. Rankin : Then there is a great range of material in regard to the wounds, and the autopsy and this point of exit or entrance of the bullet in the front of the neck, and that all has to be developed much more than we have at the present time. We have an explanation there in the autopsy that probably a fragment came out the front of the neck, but with the elevation the shot must have come from, and the angle, it seems quite apparent now, since we have the picture of where the bullet entered in the back, that the bullet entered below the shoulder blade to the right of the backbone, which is below the place where the picture shows the bullet came out in the neck band of the shirt in front , and the bullet, according to the autopsy didn’t strike any bone at all, that particular bullet, and go through. So that how it could turn and— Rep. Boggs : I thought I read that bullet just went in a finger’s length. Mr. Rankin : That is what they first said. They reached in and they could feel where it came, it didn’t go any further than that, about part of the finger or something, part of the autopsy, and then they proceeded to reconstruct where they thought.... Shaw & Harris, Cover-Up, p. 63 (Emphasis added) The above statement, standing alone, casts severe doubt on the validity of the Warren Report, if not invalidating it. What on earth could justify this document being classified as top secret and kept from the American public? The answer seems obvious: It is prime evidence of a conspiracy, which was not to be revealed. Finally, we have the testimony of an autopsy pathologist being cross-examined in a court of law. In a rare case (the only case), one of the autopsy pathologists at Bethesda, Pierre A. Finck, was cross- examined under oath concerning Kennedy’s back wound. This was in a trial of the State of Louisiana v Clay L. Shaw during the famous Jim Garrison trial in New Orleans. I obtained a copy of the transcript from the National Archives, dated February 24, 1969, in which Dr. Finck was questioned concerning the back wound: Q. Can you give me approximately how far in this probe went? A. The first fraction of an inch. Q. If you had dissected this area, Doctor, wouldn’t you have been able to ascertain what the track was, as you have described in this courtroom, without dissecting it? A. I don’t know. Q. You don’t know? A. I don’t know. Wounds are different in one case from another, and I did not dissect. [46] This is further confirmation that the back wound was shallow and therefore did not penetrate through to the throat. Also, why did Dr. Finck not dissect the wound? Why did he violate standard practice, which is to dissect wounds to see where they go? At no place in his book does Posner dare mention the foregoing statements of Secret Service agent Clinton Hill, or FBI agents Sibert and O’Neill, or Admiral Burkley’s death report, or Dr. Finck’s testimony in New Orleans. The reason for Posner’s omissions seems obvious. It was not because he did not know about them. It was exactly the opposite. He did know—and he knew that his case for the lone gunman would be destroyed if he included these testimonies. Posner’s case, like that of the Warren Commission, is clearly untenable. The importance of the location and nature of the back wound cannot be overemphasized. That"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"evidence alone, combined with a simple count of the irreducible number of gunshots, proves—-beyond a reasonable doubt—that there were at least two assassins at Dealey Plaza, both firing at Kennedy at the same time. Only Two Empty Shells [47] The foregoing discussions have been based on statements in the Warren Commission Report that three empty 6.5mm cartridge shells were found on the sixth floor of the School Book Depository, and one live round was found in the rifle chamber. Thus, no more than three shots would have been fired from Oswald’s rifle. This was accepted by the Commission as a fundamental premise. But a new document, found by Anna Marie in the National Archives, throws severe doubt on the three-empty-cartridges premise. This document (see Exhibit 10-12A), is in the form of a copy of an evidence envelope which contained photographs, with the envelope signed by FBI special agent J. Doyle Williams: File No. 89-43-1A28 Date Received 11-22-63 By: J. Doyle Williams ( Name of Special Agent) Description: 2 negatives and 4 prints of each of two 6.5 bullet hulls & 1 live round of 6.5 ammunition from rifle found on 6th floor of Texas School Book Depository, Dallas, on 11-22-63 The photographs in the envelope consisted of eight prints, all showing two empty cartridges and one round of live ammunition. I selected one of these photographs for inclusion in Exhibit 10-12B. When I received this, it appeared to be most important evidence indeed. How ironic, I thought, after all these years of arguing and controversy over the magic bullet and the number of shots, to discover such conclusive evidence that there were only two empty cartridges. The entire case of the government was built on a house of cards. This FBI document and photograph were never, insofar as I have been able to determine, shown to the Warren Commission. They are another example of Hoover’s FBI concealing evidence. But this evidence did not come as a complete surprise. Author Gary Shaw, in his book Cover-Up (first published in 1976), revealed a document showing that only two spent 6.5mm rounds had been recorded in the original evidence sheet, yet Warren Commission Exhibit CE2003 showed that the two rounds had now become three, in a distorted hand “correction.” (See Exhibit 10-13A and 10-13B.) The number “2” in the original document had obviously been written over to make it “3.” I had known about these documents in Shaw’s book but had decided to leave them out of this book on the basis that there were possibly other explanations for the change from 2 to 3, such as a simple correction of an honest mistake in the original report. But now the photographs and the obviously authentic corroborating report in FBI agent Williams’ handwriting elevated the evidence in Shaw’s book to a “best evidence” rating. For thirty years, this accumulation of evidence of a conspiracy had been buried and suppressed in the National Archives under the guise of national security. It is difficult to imagine how different history would have been had these photographs been made available to the public in 1963. Seeking confirmation that I was on the right track, I called veteran researcher Mary Ferrell [48] and asked if she knew about the J. Doyle Williams document and photographs. I sent her a copy by fax. She"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"replied that she hadn’t heard of it. I also decided to dig further into the Warren Commission Report and Gary Shaw’s book to see what else was available. In Commission Exhibit 510 (shown as Exhibit 10-14 in this book) I found, to my amazement, a photograph of what appeared to be only two empty cartridges and one live round of ammunition lying on the floor next to the cardboard boxes on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building. Strangely this had been overlooked by everyone, or it had been seen and dismissed for some reason. I then looked at the testimony of Dallas Deputy Sheriff Luke Mooney, who was the person who had discovered the cartridges on the sixth floor. His testimony deserves inclusion here to show how Commissioner Joseph Ball, in his questioning of Mooney, arrived at the Warren Commission’s conclusion of three empty shells. Referring to Commission Exhibit 510, Mr. Ball asked Mooney to encircle the shells in the photograph: Mr. Ball Is that the empty shells you found? Mr. Mooney Yes, Sir Mr. Ball Are they shown there? Mr. Mooney. Yes, sir. Mr. Ball. Now, will you take this and encircle the shells? Mr. Mooney. All right. Mr. Ball. Put a fairly good sized circle around each shell. That is the way they were when you saw them, is that right? Mr. Mooney. Yes, sir. I assume that this possibly could have been the first shot. Mr. Ball. You cannot speculate about that? Mr. Mooney. You cannot speculate about that. Mr. Ball. Those were empty shells? Mr. Mooney. Yes, sir. Mr. Ball. They were turned over to Captain Fritz? Mr. Mooney. Yes, sir; he [ Captain Fritz ] was the first officer that picked them up, as far as I know, because I stood there and watched him go over and pick them up and look at them. As far as I could tell, I couldn’t even tell what caliber they were, because I didn’t get down that close to them . They were brass cartridges, brass shells. Mr. Ball. Is this the position of the cartridges as shown on 510, as you saw them? Mr. Mooney. Yes, sir. That is just about the way they were laying, to the best of my knowledge. I do know there was—one was further away, and these other two were relatively close together—on this particular area. But these cartridges—this one and this one looks like they are further apart than they actually was. Mr. Ball. Which ones? Mr. Mooney. This one and this one. Mr. Ball. Now, two cartridges were close together, is that right? Mr. Mooney. The one cartridge here, by the wall facing, is right. And this one and this one, they were further away from this one. Mr. Ball. Well... Mr. Mooney. But as to being positive of the exact distance... Mr. Ball. You think that the cartridges are in the same position as when you saw them in this picture 510? Mr. Mooney. As far as my knowledge, they are; pretty close to right. Mr. Ball. Well, we will label these cartridges, the empty shells as “A,” “B,” and “C.” W.C. Vol. III, p. 286 (Emphasis added)"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" One can see in the questioning that Ball immediately starts referring to “empty shells,” and that Mooney was not the one who was close to them to see them well, or the one who picked them up . Captain Fritz picked them up. The questioning continues all the way through, and then they are labeled as empty shells A, B, and C. But look once again at Exhibit 10-14. The shell circled and labeled as “A” appears to be a live round, identical to the rounds of live ammunition shown in the photographs in the envelope submitted by Doyle to the FBI. I could not believe my eyes—for thirty years there was a photograph in the Warren Commission Report apparently showing only two empty shells and one round of live ammunition and it seemingly had never been observed by anyone. I called Mary Ferrell and pointed this out to her. She said she was also surprised to see that this was a round of live ammunition and did not know of anyone who had noticed it before or written about it. I then went back to Gary Shaw’s book and found that, although not mentioning the photograph in the Commission Report showing two empty shells and one live round, he had written that only two empty cartridges were turned over to the FBI by the Dallas police. This is documented in Warren Commission Exhibit No. 2003: Q6 6.5 millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano cartridge case from building Q7 6.5 millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano cartridge case from building Q8 6.5 millimeter Mannlicher-Carcano cartridge from rifle W.C. Vol.. XXIV, p. 262 Emphasis added) So, now, combining the discovery of the J. Doyle Williams’ envelope and photographs showing only two empty shells; with the discovery that the original Warren Commission Report showed the same thing; with the evidence that a document was altered to change the number of empty cartridges from 2 to 3; and, further, with the fact that only two empty cartridges were listed in the Warren Commission list of evidence supplied by the Dallas police and the FBI—it seemed overwhelming that there were, in fact, only two empty cartridge cases. It also appeared that this information had been glossed over and suppressed because it would have devastated the conclusion of the Warren Commission of a lone gunman, which was linked to three empty cartridge cases, based on what the FBI told the Commission. The answer was clear: (a) the evidence of three empty cartridge cases was fabricated, and (b) deputy sheriff Luke Mooney was led into testifying that there were three empty cartridges when there were in fact only two. I wondered how an honorable man such as Joseph Ball could have gotten himself involved in such a transparent scheme. After completing the above writing, yet another document would surface on June 27, 1994 that added credence to the conclusion of only two empty shells. This was in the book Searching the Shadows by Steven S. Airheart. I obtained a copy of the document (see Exhibit 10-16). It shows that the Dallas police found a 6.5mm rifle and two spent hulls on the sixth floor of the School Book Depository on November 22, 1963 between 1:30 and 2:15 p.m. Note two spent hulls , not three, as was used by the Warren Commission to “make” its case for a lone gunman. I thought surely no more evidence could ever be necessary to put away forever the Warren Com-mission’s single-bullet fabrication. Then a final nail in the coffin came to light. The Puzzle Comes Together "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The fact that Kennedy and Connally were hit by separate bullets (and thus, by the Warren Commission’s own definition, there was a conspiracy) was even confirmed by J. Edgar Hoover himself! In a taped telephone conversation with Lyndon Johnson on November 29, 1963 (recently released by the National Archives), Hoover told Johnson that there were three shots: The first shot hit Kennedy, the second shot hit Connally, and the third shot hit Kennedy. What follows is a verbatim transcription of their conversation: Johnson : How many...how many shots were fired? Hoover : Three. Johnson : Any of them fired at me? Hoover : No. All three at the President...and we have them. Two of the shots fired at the President were splintered...but they had characteristics on them so that our ballistics experts were able to prove that they were fired by this gun...the third shot which hit the President...he was hit by the first and the third...second shot hit the Governor . The third shot is a complete bullet...and that ruled [ sic ] out of the President’s head...it tore a large part of the President’s head off...and, in trying to massage his heart at the hospital...on the way to the hospital...they apparently loosened that and it fell on to the stretcher. And we recovered that. And we have that. And we have the gun here also. (Emphasis added) This is indisputable proof that on November 29, 1963, J. Edgar Hoover and Lyndon Johnson knew that Connally and Kennedy were hit by separate bullets and, therefore, they knew that the Warren Report was a fraud when it was later issued. I asked myself what could have been the chain of events that led to this obvious alteration and suppression of evidence. I wrote down what seemed a plausible scenario: 1. The initial plan was for three shots to do the job. It was not necessary that it appear to be a lone assassin. On the contrary, it was intended to look like a conspiracy originating in Cuba. Two shots would be diversions to attract attention away from the front, fired from the rear, probably from the sixth floor of the School Book Depository Building, and they would be meant to miss, for fear of hitting someone other than John Kennedy. The third shot would be fired from the front-right and meant to be the fatal shot. With this advance plan, two empty shell cases to match Oswald’s rifle were either planted on the sixth floor or in fact fired from Oswald’s rifle. 2. But the third shot did not do the job. It missed its target (the head or heart?) and struck Kennedy in the throat. The conspirators then signaled for a fourth shot from a second location at the rear, to be certain of a fatal shot. This fourth shot missed JFK and hit Connally. Then, in desperation, another shot was fired from the front-right. That was the fatal shot that hit Kennedy in the right-front temple, tearing out a gaping hole in the back of his head. [49] 3. A copy of the Zapruder film of the assassination was sent to J. Edgar Hoover on November 23. By that time, the decision had been made to drop the original plan and go to the lone-assassin story. (The original plan had gone awry—Oswald had been captured instead of killed, and a cover story of Oswald in Mexico City had been blown. [50] ) In a quick review, Hoover soon saw that the Zapruder film would reveal the necessity of at least three shots from the School Book Depository for the lone-assassin story to work. This is why he told Johnson on November 29 that separate shots hit Connally and Kennedy. 4. Since only two empty cartridges had either been planted or fired from Oswald’s rifle, and since"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"photographs had been taken and reports prepared to that effect, this evidence had to be suppressed, destroyed, or forged. Then, to conceal evidence of a conspiracy, the FBI, in concert with the Dallas police, proceeded to do the following: a) Changed the initial evidence report (Exhibit 10-13A) to read three empty cartridges rather than two (Exhibit 10-13B). b) Suppressed J. Doyle Williams’ report and photos by not submitting them to the Warren Commission; they would be buried in the National Archives for thirty years. However, the problem compounded. A few weeks after Hoover talked with Johnson, the Commission would discover, after analyzing the Zapruder film, that if the film were to be used as timing evidence it would have been impossible for Oswald to have fired all three shots in the time between the shots shown on the film. The only way the Commission could resolve this was to make the arbitrary assumption that the bullet which struck Kennedy in the back passed through Kennedy’s throat and went on to inflict all the wounds on Connally. This used up one bullet. The Commission then used up one more bullet as causing JFK’s fatal head wound. They were now at the point where two bullets could, with their fabrications, explain all of the wounds inflicted on both Kennedy and Connally. But having the altered evidence in their possession (submitted to them from the FBI) showing three empty cartridges, there was one bullet left over. The Commission decided to declare that this was a shot that missed. This convenient rationale could be used to partially explain the evidence of other shots. (Virtually all witnesses had heard at least three shots.) The Commission stated that it did not know whether the first shot or the second shot was the one that missed. And this is how it was left in the Commission’s final report and where it stands today. Then the Commission guided Mooney to state in his testimony that there were three empty shells. The answer now seemed obvious: Hoover knew on November 29 that three empty cartridges were needed in the School Book Depository to account for the wounds in Kennedy and Connally. Thus the alteration and deception to conceal the fact of only two empty cartridges were ordered and carried out. Only later would the timing evidence in the FBI firing test and the Zapruder film force the Warren Commission into its ridiculous magic-bullet hypothesis. There was another piece to the puzzle. In my later conversations with Mary Ferrell, she pointed out that three empty cartridges were in fact shown in Commission Exhibit 512. (See Exhibit 10-15 in this book.) Sure enough, the circle that had been labeled “A” in Exhibit 10-14 now has what crudely appears to be an empty cartridge propped up against one of the cardboard boxes. It seemed that this was an attempt at forgery to conceal the fact that there were only two empty cartridges and one round of live ammunition, as shown in the photograph in Exhibit 10-14. But now look closely at the empty cartridge in the lower circle on Exhibit 10-15. There is a darkened area around it and the cartridge appears to be bent. It looks like a crude hand-forgery job. Somehow, both the authentic photo and the forged photo slipped through to the Commission. The plotters were human. They were caught in their own web. One more important note: In Joseph Ball’s questioning of deputy sheriff Mooney, he focused on Exhibit 10-14. Why did he choose Exhibit 10-14 instead of Exhibit 10-15, both of which are in the Commission Report? The answer could be that Joseph Ball knew that Exhibit 10-14 was authentic and he could not understand Exhibit 10-15, so he avoided attracting attention to it. This evidence is powerful and persuasive. It shows a pragmatic but botched attempt by the FBI, in concert with the Dallas police, to fabricate evidence to create the illusion that Oswald acted alone after the original plan had gone badly wrong. The Warren Commission was snared in a web of deception. The FBI and the Commission’s efforts were a Keystone Cops fiasco. Yet it worked. Why? Because the people in charge of the investigation, LBJ and Hoover, made it work. They had the power to tailor and confine the investigation to suit their needs. "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"* * * If the foregoing doesn’t convince the reader, there is much more evidence to prove that there was more than one gunman. This subject will appear again and again as this book progresses. It is basic to understanding the assassination and cover-up. The reason is evident: Certain officials in U.S. government considered it absolutely indispensable that evidence of more than one gunman be suppressed, distorted, or destroyed. Otherwise, they would not have been able to contain the investigation. If the foregoing evidence had not been suppressed or distorted it seems inescapable that outrage would have arisen in the American public, and a complete investigation would have been demanded. The citizens of this country would not have been satisfied until a second gunman was found. As will be discussed in the following chapters, the government officials were compelled to resort to even more extreme measures to cover up the crime, some that were so bizarre and so ghoulish as to defy imagination. In a court of law before an impartial and intelligent jury, it would seem that no further evidence would be required to prove a conspiracy of major magnitude. This evidence, one should confidently feel, would meet reasonable-doubt standards; arguments to the contrary would cease. But not so. To this day, thirty-three years later, there remains a small but influential scattering of people, articulate and intelligent, who write papers, stand on lecture platforms, and righteously defend the fabricated story of the lone assassin. There is a peculiar sycophancy in these people. This is apparent in such influential organs as the Journal of the American Medical Association [51] which has in recent years launched a campaign publishing articles attacking what it derisively calls the Conspirati —as if those who challenge the Warren Commission are a small band of radicals and paranoiacs—ignoring the fact that polls show only 13 percent of the American populace believe the Warren Commission Report. For more analysis of evidence supporting the conclusion that Connally was struck by a separate bullet, please study the Zapruder frames in the following chapters and in the color photo section.

The smaller slug also could have been previously fired and recovered, resulting in ballistic markings which match the original weapon and not the 30.06 which fired the “sabot” slug. A 30.06 shell casing indicating the use of a “sabot” was found in the 1970s on the roof of the Dallas County Records Building overlooking Dealey Plaza. By using a partially charged cartridge, a “sabot” can be used for a “meat shot”; that is to fire a bullet at low velocity that does not penetrate the body, but is a marker found in the body that will trace back to a rifle from which the bullet was not fired—i.e., Oswald’s rifle.

The bullet in the center (CE 399) is the bullet purportedly found on John Connally’s stretcher. Its rifle markings trace back to Oswald’s rifle. The nick in the nose was removed for laboratory analysis. The other two bullets were fired from Oswald’s rifle into long tubes of cotton; it is difficult to tell the difference between these bullets and the one in the center. There was no statistically significant loss of weight in Bullet 399. The Warren Commission found that the CE 399 stretcher bullet weighed 158.6 grains when recovered and assumed its original weight before firing to have been 160-161 grains. Is it possible that the CE 399 bullet sustained a weight loss of only 1.4 to 2.4 grains during the wounding of President Kennedy and Governor Connally? Because of manufacturing variations, all bullet weights are approximate and it is not possible to determine the exact weight loss of a fired bullet without knowing its exact weight prior to firing. (HSCA Vol. VII, p. 372) Dr. Milton Helpern, world-renowned forensic pathologist and chief medical examiner for the City of New York, stated: “This bullet wasn’t distorted in any way. I cannot accept the premise that this bullet thrashed around in all that bony tissue and lost only 1.4 to 2.4 grains of its original weight. I cannot believe either that this bullet is going to emerge miraculously unscathed, without any deformity, and with its land and grooves intact...” (Thompson, p. 153). See Exhibit 10-9A (center) for example of bullet fired into the wrist of a cadaver. Despite a spectrographic and neutron activation test conducted by the FBI and the HSCA, a positive link of bullet CE 399 to either Connally or Kennedy has never been made. At first it appeared that a positive link had been made by the HSCA, but the credibility of the tests was severely diminished when it was revealed that the fragments (obtained from the National Archives for the purpose of making the tests) were not traceable back to having come from bullet CE 399. Worse yet, it was revealed that the lot of bullets obtained from the cartridge manufacturer was not necessarily of the same vintage as the lot of bullets from which Oswald had purchased his (Hurt, pp. 78-86).

It is Dr. Costella’s edit that inserts missing frames that were lost in the MPI process, corrects for pin-cushion effects at the sprocket holes, and wrong frame numbers. Any changes (or comments) that I have made in the captions are highlighted and in brackets.] Abraham Zapruder’s filming of the assassination of President Kennedy must rank as one of the great moments in the annals of photography. The total film, lasting about twenty-six seconds, shows in startling fidelity the assassination of a beloved and idolized president of the United States. The film shows the facial expressions of horror and disbelief of Jacqueline Kennedy and John Connally. It shows the eruption of blood and brains as the fatal bullet strikes. It even shows a small red spot appear on the back of John Connally’s jacket as he crumples after being struck by the assassin’s bullet. But, more important, it reveals evidence of a conspiracy that, by deduction from the chain of possession of the film, leads to the conclusion that the highest government officials must have been involved. Yet the great majority of the American people have seen only a few of these frames, and generally those of very poor quality. With modern computer photographic reproduction technology, it has recently become possible, at a minimal expense, to make high-quality, laser-color enlarged prints from 35mm slides of the film, thus allowing it to be available to researchers without prohibitive costs. The Zapruder frames (shown in the color photo section of this book) were first analyzed by me using Canon color copies that I made from 35mm slides of the film, which I had obtained from David Lifton, author of the book Best Evidence on the Kennedy assassination. I made a set of slides and print copies of all frames from the film positives. I compared each frame with those printed (in poor quality) in the Warren Commission Report to be certain I was dealing with the same evidence that was used by the Warren Commission. I also compared them with frames in Life magazine and frames that I obtained from the Secret Service box in the National Archives. Then I visited the Washington, D.C., attorney who handles the Zapruder family estate, James Silverberg, Esq., and obtained rental copies of selected frames and a continuous film strip copy made from the professed original 8mm film now held in the National Archives. I examined these with a physicist’s lens. All frames are in agreement. I am satisfied that what the reader sees in this book is a genuine copy of the film—with one very important qualification: The Warren Commission may not have had a copy of the camera original .

The reader is urged to study the frames and their captions and the referenced exhibits . It cuts across almost all chapters in the book and should be read with that in mind. More analysis of specific subjects will appear in subsequent chapters. The material is graphic and shocking but nevertheless requires careful scrutiny for those who want to understand the prime forensic evidence in the assassination. It has resulted in the following primary conclusions: (1) There is conclusive evidence, based on the impossibly rapid head and shoulder motion of Secret Service agent William Greer, that the film has been forged (altered) by removal of frames from the film in at least two locations: between frames 302 and 303 and frames 316 and 317. (This does not include frames that are missing in the portion of the film when the limousine was behind the freeway sign, which has previously been explained by Life as an inadvertent breaking of the film during its handling.) (2) JFK was first hit either just before or after he passed behind the freeway sign. When he emerged from behind the sign, he had already been hit. (3) The Zapruder film, when projected on the screen, does not show the limousine slowing down or stopping, contrary to the sworn testimonies of credible eyewitnesses. Yet analysis of blur and focus in the film indicates that the limousine came to a virtually complete stop in the time span between frames 302 and 303 (an impossibility). This is further evidence of forgery of the film. (4) The Zapruder film does not show the fatal blowout (eruption of material) of the back of JFK’s head described by doctors and nurses at Parkland Hospital. This is further evidence that frames were removed. (5) Additional evidence of frame removal in the film is indicated by John Connally’s position in the limousine shown in the Moorman photograph. (See Exhibit C-1 in the color photo section.) At no frame in the Zapruder film does Connally appear in this position. (6) The fact of frame removal from the film by the conspirators makes moot the controversy over the so-called backward head snap of JFK between frames 313 and 321. (7) The fact of frame removal from the film makes it possible for one gunman from the rear to have had time to fire the fatal head shot and to fire a separate shot that struck John Connally. This does not mean that is what occurred, however. By referring to the color photo section, we can evaluate the validity of the foregoing conclusions. But, first, it will be helpful to study Exhibit 11-1, which shows the timing of the critical events leading up to the fatal shot at Zapruder frame 313, based on the assumption that the film has not been altered or frames removed—an assumption that I will argue is invalid."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Exhibit 11-1. Timing Sequence of Gunshot Data. This chart is based on the assumption that the Zapruder film has not been altered or frames removed; it is presented here for analytical purposes only. Refer to color photo section for analysis of the Zapruder frames and tests with athletes which prove the validity of the conclusion that the Zapruder film was altered."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Exhibits C-2, C-3, and C-4 (at the end of Chapter 12) show the results of body and shoulder movement tests, conducted with a tennis professional by myself and confirmed independently by Charles Marler, which demonstrates the validity of the conclusion that the Zapruder film was altered to delete events that would have revealed that John Kennedy was shot from the front. It should be noted that between Zapruder frame 302 and 303, Greer turned from looking straight ahead to looking backward, the reverse of the motion between frame 316 and frame 317, but without the aid of the spring effect from the upper body and neck coil at frame 316—thus the results shown here are conservative when applied to 302/303. The crucial point to consider is the maximum rotational speed to which the athletes were capable of accelerating their heads and shoulders, as compared to Greer as shown in the Zapruder film. Note in the table (Exhibit C-4) that the maximum angular velocity of Greer (2106 degrees per second) is double that of Dawson and three times that of Marler. This has major significance in that, by the laws of physics, the energy required to accelerate a mass to a given velocity is directly proportional to the square of the velocity (E = 1/2 MV 2 ). Therefore Greer would have required four times the energy of Dawson, and nine times the energy of Marler. One explanation for the slower speed of Marler compared to Dawson is that Marler was seated in a convertible automobile, thus being more restrained or anchored on his bottom, whereas Dawson was seated on a stool and could spin around more readily. Therefore, the Marler test is a more realistic comparison to Greer. We will now examine, in depth, how the forgery of the Zapruder film could have been accomplished, and who most likely did it. Along the way, more proof of missing frames will become apparent."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Mr. Liebele r. Do you recognize that this picture was taken at the time you were there? Mr. Zapruder . Yes; I was there and I would say this couldn’t be anybody else, unless— if this is an authentic photograph and it isn’t composed now or changed —I would say that’s me. That’s the first time I have seen that. Were these pictures ever published in a magazine—there were pictures like that I suppose—actually? Abraham Zapruder’s testimony to the Warren Commission , W.C. Vol. VII, p. 570 (Emphasis added) 12 FORGERY OF THE ZAPRUDER FILM Many reputations have been invested in faith in the Zapruder film as an undisturbed portrayal of the Kennedy assassination; this psychology is deeply imbedded. Many who believe that there was a conspiracy cite the rapid backward acceleration of Kennedy’s body in the Zapruder film after the fatal head shot as prime evidence of a bullet striking from the front or right; and they cite the measurement of time between shots in the Zapruder film as proof that Oswald could not have acted alone. But, if frames have been removed from the film, that evidence is put in question, on all sides of the controversy. As for myself, for years I never questioned the authenticity of the Zapruder film. But in recent years I have changed my mind. This was only after I obtained a high-quality copy of the film and examined it frame by frame in enlarged prints, in light of all of the other pertinent evidence I could identify. Recapping Chapter 11, there are several profound questions: (1) How can we explain what appears to be missing frames between frames 302 and 303 and 316 and 317? Was it a mechanical defect in the camera, causing random skipping, or was it deliberate removal of frames to conceal evidence? (2) How can we explain eyewitness testimony that the presidential limousine slowed to almost a complete halt, or actually came to a halt just before the fatal head wound, yet the movement of the limousine, as measured by the film, is a steady 11 miles per hour? (3) How can we explain the fact that the film shows no eruption of blood or matter from the back of Kennedy’s head if there was indeed a shot from the front that blew out a hole three inches in diameter in the back of the head as described by doctors and witnesses at Parkland Hospital in Dallas? (4) How can we explain that the top, back, and right side of Kennedy’s head remained intact in the Zapruder film in contradiction to an autopsy photograph, taken at the beginning of the autopsy before the first autopsy incision was made, showing that the right side, top, and rear portion of the skull had been blown away? Missing Frames: A Mechanical Defect in the Camera? My first thought was to resolve the question of whether or not the missing frames could have been introduced by a mechanical defect in the camera, causing it to randomly skip frames. I considered this to be an extremely remote possibility. Most people with whom I discussed this—including an experienced motion picture editor and an eminent motion picture technologist [52] —scoffed at the thought. But, nevertheless, I thought that the possibility should be dealt with by independent, formal, scientific analysis before proceeding. I decided to approach Failure Analysis, Inc., an engineering and scientific firm in Menlo Park, California, to see if it could help me analyze a duplicate of the Bell and Howell camera that Zapruder had used to take the movie. Failure Analysis’s specialty is analyzing equipment failures. The"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"company became involved in the controversy of the Kennedy assassination when it agreed to do a study for the California Bar Association in which it developed arguments, pro and con, for the lone-gunman hypothesis. Unfortunately, what most people know about its work is only from those who want to prove Oswald acted alone. It is not generally known that Failure Analysis, Inc., had developed both sides of the evidence. In fact, its president, Dr. Roger McCarthy, had arbitrarily taken the side that there was more than one gunman. I was pleased that my analysis of Zapruder frames 224 and 225, as related to the timing sequence of the gunshots, agreed almost exactly with Dr. McCarthy’s analysis. Inasmuch as his company seemed to be very balanced and objective, I felt I could approach him with a request for a proposal to do a failure analysis on Zapruder’s Bell and Howell camera, without expecting him to side one way or the other on the controversy. I sent a letter to Dr. McCarthy, enclosing my analysis of frames 316 and 317, and asked for a proposal. About three weeks later, I received a call back from Dr. Angela Meyer, to whom my proposal request had been referred. She apologized for taking so long because she had been on vacation. She told me that they had decided not to become further involved in the Kennedy assassination controversy because it was costing them too much money. It was interesting that she said Gerald Posner had called their firm inquiring about their work and had talked only with their scientist who had taken the side of the lone-gunman hypothesis. The next thing they knew, Posner’s book came out using their material to try to make his case. She said that, in fact, both she and Dr. McCarthy had taken the side that there was more than one gunman; but, nevertheless, they were not going to get involved further. One point she did make, however, which proved to be quite revealing, was a suggestion by Dr. McCarthy. He suggested that it would not be fruitful to pursue mechanical analysis of the Bell and Howell camera but, rather, more information might be gained by studying the white spot appearing on the grass just above the limousine. I had seen that white spot before and had considered that it might be a good index point for measurement of limousine speed, but had done nothing about it. I told Dr. Meyer that I would act on that suggestion. I got out my file of Zapruder frames and prepared a graph showing the motion of the limousine as related to the white spot on the grass. This is shown in Exhibit 12-1. I was surprised to see that it was a straight line, indicating no abrupt changes of the limousine speed with respect to the white spot, which one might expect if frames had been removed. But then I began to see what Dr. McCarthy might have been alluding to. The fact that this was essentially a straight line did not prove whether frames were or were not removed, but it did prove that there was no random skipping of frames. The reason for this is that if frames had been skipped randomly there would have been at least one distinctive upward jog in the time-motion line on the graph. There is no such jog. So here, without spending several thousand dollars (which I anticipated the study would take), was proof that there was no random skipping of frames caused by a camera malfunction. But I also wondered if it were proof that no frames had been removed at all."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Exhibit 12-1. Apparent Speed of Presidential Limousine Between Zapruder Frames 313 and 330. This graph was determined by measuring the distance between a white spot on the grass (on the opposite side of Elm Street from Zapruder) and a fixed point on the limousine (on the chrome trim of the divider between the front seat and the jump seat). The graph shows an almost perfect uniform rate of advance (within measurement accuracy), indicating that there was not random skipping of frames due to mechanical defect in the camera. It does not prove, however, whether or not there was a deliberate removal of frames in a consistent pattern by the conspirators. See text for discussion. (In preparing this graph, I have assumed that the white spot was real, not painted in to create an illusion of uniform speed.) I conducted a “mind experiment.” I imagined the limousine standing still, having come to a complete stop. Further, I imagined that none of the limousine’s occupants were moving and that there were no moving objects in the background. In this case, the camera could skip frames and it would not be noticed when projected on a screen, or in a frame-by-frame viewing, only if precisely all of the frames in which the limousine was standing still were somehow miraculously skipped by the camera. Only then would the line in Exhibit 12-1 be straight and unchanged. If the camera had not precisely skipped all of the missing frames, there would be a horizontal jog in the line. The possibility of the camera precisely skipping all the missing frames was, of course, nil. (I discussed this with three different experts in camera and film technology, and they all agreed.) I now imagined that the limousine was moving slowly. In this case, if there were a random skipping of frames it would show up in jogs upward from the straight line, at least in one spot on the graph. But that also didn’t occur. But the question remained: If, as I believed, frames had been removed by the conspirators, why was the graph a straight line? The answer then occurred to me. If they had removed frames in a consistent pattern , say two out of every four frames, or four out of every five frames, and they had removed all of the frames when the limousine was standing still, then the time/motion graph would be a straight line; any excessively rapid motion in the film would stand out as appearing unusual because there would be a sudden jump— such as the rapid movement of Greer’s head and upper body and Kennedy’s head and upper body. The two foregoing scenarios fit exactly the case we have in these frames. The limousine is moving slowly, perhaps very slowly, or standing still. There are no moving objects in the background except"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"people who are standing still or moving very slowly. The only readily discernible rapid motions that take place between frames 313 to 330 are: (a) Greer’s rapid head and body turn between frames 316 and 317, and (b) the backward snap of Kennedy’s head and body occurring after 313. At this point, I had satisfied myself that frames had been removed by the conspirators, and I saw that they had an impossible situation. They could remove frames to delete incriminating evidence and get an apparent uniform speed of the limousine, but they could not conceal excessively rapid movements of passengers in the limousine. That would have required an almost complete recreation of the film which, with the technology available in 1963, would probably have been impossible. The conspirators were trapped. Their attempts to forge the Zapruder film would ultimately be discovered. Their only hope now was to suppress the distribution of the film—print only limited frames or poor-quality copies of the film for the public, hoping the forgery would not be discovered until the conspirators were long gone. That appears to be exactly what happened. The Zapruder film was never shown to the public in complete detail until pried out of the hands of Life magazine by District Attorney Jim Garrison in New Orleans. The genie was then out of the bottle. I then examined the film for the frames around Z302 and Z303 using the same technique. The answer was the same: The limousine showed an almost perfectly uniform motion, but the rapid turn of Greer, turning backward between Z302 and Z303 with his head in sharp focus, revealed that frames had been removed in a consistent pattern. Also, the rapid backward snap of Kennedy’s head after 313 was confirmation of frame removal. Blur Analysis: Mathematical Proof of Missing Frames Now I considered that calculations should prove, to a mathematical certainty, that a turn as rapid as Greer’s would result in a severe motion blur of his head in the photograph. The calculations turned out to be simple. (1) Visualize Greer’s head as a segment of a six-inch-diameter cylinder, turning about a vertical axis: (2) Between frames 316 and 317, Greer’s head (and body) turned 115 degrees in 1/18.3 seconds (the shutter speed of the camera was 18.3 frames per second). The rate of speed of the turn is: 115 ÷ 1/18.3 = 2,106 degrees per second There are 360 degrees in one circle, so Greer is turning at the rate of 2106 ÷ 360 = 5.85 revolutions per second! This is obviously impossible, but let’s go on with the blur calculations. (3) Although Zapruder’s Bell and Howell camera had a shutter speed of 1/18.3 frames per second, the actual exposure time was 1/30 second, according to Dr. Luis Alverez, who was a consultant to Bell and Howell on this camera. To calculate blur, one simply has to calculate the distance that a point on the cylinder would travel in 1/30 second. (4) The speed of travel of a point on the cylinder is: Tangential speed = Revolutions per second × diameter × 3.14 "},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"= 5.85 × 6 × 3.14 = 110 inches per second. In 1/30 second, a point on Greer’s head would travel 110 × 1/30 = 3.6 inches. This is 38 percent of the visible circumference of the cylinder. Since any point on the cylinder would travel the same distance, all points would be a blur. But there is little or no motion blur in Greer’s hairline above the forehead. If frames were not removed, there should be frames between 316 and 317 showing a complete blur of the head. But there are no such frames there. Therefore, frames were removed. The only way that the head would not be a complete motion blur is if the head turn occurred during the period when the shutter was closed, i.e.: 1/18.3 1/30 = .0213 seconds. Again the impossible arises. The rate of turn becomes: 115 ÷ .0213 = 5399 degrees per second = 15 revolutions per second. And the head and shoulder turn must have miraculously started and finished in the .0213-second period when the shutter was closed, for that single frame, a possibility so far-fetched as to be ridiculous. The beauty of this discovery is that scientific laboratories and white-frocked scientists are not needed. Anybody who has an 8mm movie camera or a video camera with frame-by-frame playback can easily prove it. Pick any number of select subjects and tape them making head turns as fast as they can. You will get the same results that I did. I know of no other evidence in the Kennedy assassination that is so convincing and so easily demonstrable. In point of fact, as noted in Chapter 11, this test was duplicated by an independent researcher, Charles Marler. He took motion pictures at 18 frames per second with an 8mm camera while his twenty-year-old son Chad, an athlete with a green belt in karate, sat in a convertible automobile, turning his body as rapidly as he could. The results were the same. Photos of these test frames are shown in Exhibit C-3. Compare these with the video camera tests of the tennis pro shown in Exhibit C-2, both shown graphically in Exhibit C-4 (see color photo section for these exhibits). Eyewitnesses: Limousine Slows Almost to a Stop As stated in Chapter 11, additional evidence of forgery of the Zapruder film may be deduced by the fact that during the fatal shot sequence, numerous eyewitnesses testified that the limousine had slowed down drastically or had come to a complete stop, yet the Zapruder film shows a virtually uniform speed during this time period. There is a long list of eyewitnesses who say the limousine either slowed down, swerved to the curb, or stopped completely. I selected a few (from many) testimonies in the Warren Commission Report to demonstrate the credibility and obvious authenticity of these sworn testimonies. They bear close scrutiny: (1) Roy Truly, manager of the Texas School Book Depository Building, was standing in front of the building: Mr. Belin. All right. Now, what is your best estimate of the speed as he started to go down the street here marked Parkway?"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":" Mr. Truly. He picked up a little speed along here, and then seemed to have fallen back into line, and I would say 10 or 12 miles an hour in this area. Mr. Belin. All right. Then what did you see happen? Mr. Truly. I heard an explosion, which I thought was a toy cannon or a loud firecracker from west of the building. Nothing happened at this first explosion. Everything was frozen. And immediately after two more explosions, which I realized that I thought was a gun, a rifle of some kind. The President’s— I saw the President’s car swerve to the left and stop somewheres down in this area. It is misleading here. And that is the last I saw of his car, because this crowd, when the third shot rang out—there was a large crowd all along this abutment here, this little wall, and there was some around us in front—they began screaming and falling to the ground. And the people in front of myself and Mr. Campbell surged back, either in terror or panic. They must have seen this thing. I became separated from Mr. Campbell. They just practically bore me back to the first step on the entrance of our building. Mr. Belin. When you saw the President’s car seem to stop, how long did it appear to stop? Mr. Truly . It would be hard to say over a second or two or something like that. I didn’t see—I just saw it stop. I don’t know. I didn’t see it start up. Mr. Belin. Then you stopped looking at it, or you were distracted by something else? Mr. Truly. Yes. The crowd in front of me kind of congealed around me and bore me back through weight of numbers, and I lost sight of it. W.C. Vol. III, p. 221 (Emphasis added) (2) Marion Baker was a Dallas motorcycle policeman riding to the rear of the president’s limousine, two cars behind; he confirmed Roy Truly’s and others’ statements: Mr. Belin. What other officers did you talk to and what did they say that you remember? Mr. Baker. I talked to Jim Chaney, and he made the statement that the two shots hit Kennedy first and then the other one hit the governor. Mr. Belin. Where was he? Mr. Baker. He was on the right rear of the car or to the side, and then at that time the chief of police, he didn’t know anything about this, and he moved up and told him, and then that was during the time that the Secret Service men were trying to get in the car, and at the time, after the shooting, from the time the first shot rang out, the car stopped completely, pulled to the left and stopped. Mr. Belin. The President’s car? Mr. Baker. Yes, sir. Now, I have heard several of them say that, Mr. Truly was standing out there, he said it stopped. Several officers said it stopped completely. Mr. Dulles. You saw it stop, did you? Mr. Baker. No, sir; I didn’t see it stop. Mr. Dulles. You just heard from others that it had stopped? Mr. Baker. Yes, sir; that it had completely stopped , and then for a moment there, and then they rushed on out to Parkland. W.C. Vol. III, p. 266 (Emphasis added) (3) Earle Brown was a Dallas policeman standing on the overpass of the Stemmons Freeway: Mr. Ball. Did you see the President’s motorcade come on to Houston Street from Elm; were you able to see that?"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" Mr. Brown. Now they came down Main, didn’t they, to Houston? Mr. Ball. Yes. Mr. Brown. No, sir; actually, the first I noticed the car was when it stopped . Mr. Ball. Where? Mr. Brown. After it made the turn and when the shots were fired, it stopped. Mr. Ball. Did it come to a complete stop? Mr. Brown. That, I couldn’t swear to. Mr. Ball. It appeared to be slowed down some? Mr. Brown. Yes; slowed down . W.C. Vol. II, p. 233 (Emphasis added) (4) D. V. Harkness was a Dallas policeman standing in the plaza area south of Elm Street. Mr. Belin. What did you do after you heard those noises? Did you know they were shots, by the way? Mr. Harkness. Yes, sir. Mr. Belin. What did you do? Mr. Harkness. When I saw the first shot and the President’s car slow down to almost a stop— Mr. Belin. When you saw the first shot, what do you mean by that? Mr. Harkness. When I heard the first shot and saw the President’s car almost come to a stop and some of the agents piling off the car, I went back to the intersection to get my motorcycle. W.C. Vol. VI, p. 309 (Emphasis added) (5) Bobby Hargis was a Dallas motorcycle policeman riding to the rear and left of the president’s limousine: Mr. Stern. Did something happen to you, personally in connection with the shot you have just described? Mr. Hargis. You mean about the blood hitting me? Mr. Stern. Yes. Mr. Hargis. Yes; when President Kennedy straightened back up in the car the bullet hit him in the head, the one that killed him and it seemed like his head exploded, and I was splattered with blood and brain, and kind of a bloody water. It wasn’t really blood. And at that time the Presidential car slowed down . I heard somebody say, “Get going,” or “get going,”.... W.C. Vol. VI, p. 294 (Emphasis added) (6) Senator Ralph Yarborough was riding in the vice president’s limousine, two cars behind the president’s. In his written statement to the Warren Commission, he said: After the Presidential motorcade had passed through the heart of downtown Dallas, experiencing an exceptionally warm and friendly greeting, as the motorcade went down the slope of Elm Street toward the railroad underpass, a rifle shot was heard by me; a loud blast, close by. I have handled firearms for fifty years, and thought immediately that it was a rifle shot. When the noise of the shot was heard, the motorcade slowed to what seemed to me a complete stop (though it could have been a near stop) . After what I took to be about three seconds, another shot boomed out, and after what I took to be one-half the time between the first and second shots (calculated now, this would have put the third shot about one and one-half seconds after the second shot—by my estimate—to me there"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"seemed to be a long time between the first and second shots, a much shorter time between the second and third shots—these were my impressions that day), a third shot was fired. After the third shot was fired, but only after the third shot was fired, the cavalcade speeded up, gained speed rapidly, and roared away to the Parkland Hospital. W.C. Vol. VII, pp. 439-440 (Emphasis added) The foregoing testimonies, in and of themselves, are very strong evidence, when compared with the Zapruder film, of forgery by deletion of frames by the plotters to create the illusion of a perfectly uniform speed of the limousine, and, more important, to destroy evidence of a shot from the front. The overwhelming agreement of these witnesses, with their substantial credentials, is astounding! Yet, by merely looking at the Zapruder film with the casual naked eye , it is obvious that the film shows the limousine passing by without slowing, stopping, or swerving. Moreover, calculations of limousine speed by numerous researchers, including my own calculations, do not show the limousine slowing down, stopping, or swerving at any point as it moved down Elm Street (only after the fatal shots did it speed up). My next step was to order a high-resolution laser scan, from a Scitex computer system, of frames 302, 303, 316, and 317 in 8\" x 10\" high-resolution blow-ups. The answer was the same: impossibly rapid turns by Greer, but even more dramatically obvious. I was now convinced that frames were indeed missing and that skipping of frames had not been caused by a mechanical defect in the camera. Beyond a reasonable doubt, frames had been removed by the conspirators to conceal evidence. But I still could not explain the mysterious blobs (mentioned in the caption of Zapruder frame 314, color section). I decided to set that issue aside for the moment while I examined the chain of possession of the film; perhaps it would lead me to the conspirators. Chain of Possession of the Zapruder Film My objective here was to determine who was in a position to alter the film: Who knew about the alteration, and how could the alteration have been accomplished?

Photograph of 8mm Zapruder film spool received at the FBI lab in Washington, D.C., on November 27, 1963. (See Exhibit 12-2B.) Abraham Zapruder shot his film at 12:30 p.m.; afterward, in a state of shock and confusion, he returned to his office, only one-half block from the scene of the crime. From that point on it becomes somewhat murky as to what happened to the film, depending on whose testimony one wants to believe. Considerable light was shed on what happened during the first few critical hours of possession of the film when I had the opportunity to conduct a two-hour taped interview on November 21, 1994 with Erwin Schwartz, who was Zapruder’s partner in their clothing manufacturing company, Jennifer Juniors, located in the Dal-Tex Building at Dealey Plaza, just across Houston Street from the Texas School Book Depository. This interview was arranged for me by Erwin Schwartz’s nephew, Richard Bartholomew, who is a researcher and writer on the Kennedy assassination. We conducted the interview at Vincent’s Seafood Restaurant in Dallas over lunch. Erwin Schwartz turned out to be a very sharp and astute person. He was about thirty-five years old at the time of the assassination. He told us that he had returned to his office in the Dal-Tex Building, just after the assassination, when Zapruder arrived back at the office, screaming “They killed him; they killed him!” Schwartz said that when he arrived, two Dallas policemen with shotguns were there demanding the film. Zapruder refused to give it to them, saying that he would only give it to government officials. Shortly after that, Secret Service agent Forrest Sorrels arrived and Zapruder agreed to work with him in giving up the film. They checked around and found that the best place to get the film developed was Eastman Kodak in Dallas. Zapruder, Schwartz, and Sorrels then took the film to Eastman Kodak and had it developed. During that time, Sorrels received a phone call and then told Zapruder and Schwartz that he would have to leave them, and asked if they would do him a favor and get three prints made. After discussions between Sorrels and Eastman Kodak and another phone call, the decision was made to take the film to Jamison Film Company in Dallas for reversal duplicate [56] copies to be made, which was"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"necessary before more positive prints could be made at Eastman Kodak. (Eastman Kodak did not have the capability to make the reversal duplicates.) At about 6 p.m. on November 22, Schwartz and Zapruder took the original positive copy to Jamison Film and had three reversal duplicates made. They had a Jamison representative sign a statement that they would make no more than the three reversal duplicates. Schwartz and Zapruder then took the three reversal duplicates back to Eastman Kodak where three additional positive prints were made, making a total of four positive prints. They then went to the Secret Service office and gave one of the prints to agent Sorrels, which, according to Abraham Zapruder, was sent to FBI headquarters on late November 22 or early November 23. [57] That was very important information because it has generally been accepted that Eastman Kodak developed not only the original copy of the film but also all of the work. With Jamison Film entering the scene, I thought new light might be shed on what happened in the chain of possession. But later, in a lengthy telephone conversation with Bruce Jamison, I became convinced that all Jamison did was make the three reversal duplicates, all the time under the watchful eye of Abraham Zapruder, and no bootleg copies were made. The notion that Eastman Kodak had done all of the work on the film is primarily from Forrest Sorrels’ testimony to the Warren Commission. He was the special agent in charge of the Dallas operations for the Secret Service. A careful reading of his testimony is in order. Mr. Sorrels ....At that time Mr. Harry McCormack, who is a reporter for the Dallas Morning News, and whom I have known for many years, came to me and says, “Forrest, I have something over here you ought to know about.” I said, “What have you got here?” He said, “I have a man over here that got pictures of this whole thing.” I said, “Let’s go see him.” So we went on to a building at the corner of Elm and Houston, on the east side of Houston, and across the street from the court house building there, and up to the office of a Mr. Zapruder, they have a dress manufacturing place there in that building. And he was there with another man connected with the business there, and apparently some magazine representatives there. And Mr. Zapruder was real shook up. He said that he didn’t know how in the world he had taken these pictures, that he was down there and was taking the thing there, and he says, “My God, I saw the whole thing. I saw the man’s brains come out of his head .” And so I asked Mr. Zapruder would it be possible for us to get a copy of those films . He said, yes. So then accompanied by Mr. Zapruder, and this other gentleman in the business there with him , whose name I don’t recall at the moment, and Mr. McCormack, we went then to the Dallas Morning News Building, which is about three blocks from Mr. Zapruder’s building, three or four blocks from there, with the idea of getting those films developed right away. There was no one there that would tackle the job. We then went to the television section, WFAA, of the Dallas Morning News, to see if we could get them to handle it there, and they said, no, they would not attempt to do that, but they did assist us by calling Eastman Kodak Co., and they said if we came out there right away, that they would get right on it. We got a police car, and went right on out to the Eastman Kodak Co., and while there I met another gentleman who had seen some still pictures, and I arranged with him for us to get copies of those. W.C. Vol. VII, p. 352 (Emphasis added) "},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The above statements by Forrest Sorrels have been interpreted to mean that the film was first developed by Eastman Kodak with no other film laboratory involved. Also, Sorrels mentions “another man connected with the business there” whom we now see was Erwin Schwartz. Sorrels did not mention Jamison Film Laboratory. How does this compare to Abraham Zapruder’s testimony to the Warren Commission? In Zapruder’s testimony, Wesley Liebeler questioned him about the development of the film. Mr. Liebeler. Now, Mr. Zapruder, after you had the film developed I understand Mr. Sorrels from the Secret Service came over and helped you get the films developed and you gave two copies of your films to Mr. Sorrels, is that correct? Mr. Zapruder. Yes. One we have sent to Washington the same night and one went over for the viewers of the FBI on Ervay Street. Mr. Liebeler. That’s the Secret Service? Mr. Zapruder. The Secret Service—I brought one roll there and they told me to dispatch it by Army plane or I don’t know what they had done with it but it was supposed to have gone to Washington and one of them, I believe, remained here with Mr. Sorrels. He came to my office quite a few times to show them to different people. Mr. Liebeler. Now, I understand that you, yourself, retained the original film? Mr. Zapruder. No; I don’t have that at all —I don’t have any at all. They were sold to Time and Life magazines. Mr. Liebeler. You sold that to Life magazine? Mr. Zapruder. Yes. W.C. Vol. VII, p. 575 (Emphasis added) Also note that two copies were given to the U.S. government—one to the FBI in Washington, and the other to the Secret Service in Dallas; Exhibits 12-2B and 12-2C show that the Secret Service loaned its copy to the FBI in Dallas, which sent it to the FBI in Washington on November 27, and it was returned on December 4. This is confirmed in a recent document I obtained from the National Archives showing that a copy of the film was sent to the FBI on November 23 by the Secret Service. (See Exhibit 12-2B and - 2C.) Now we have something appearing to be sinister that enters the picture. In 1992, Dick Russell interviewed Paul Rothermel, Jr., a former chief aide to Dallas oil billionaire H. L. Hunt. Rothermel told Russell a remarkable story. He said that he was sent by the Hunt family in the late afternoon following the assassination “with a substantial amount of money to buy the original; I got the first copy as far as I know.” Dick Russell asked, “Before Time-Life negotiated for theirs?” “Yeah,” Rothermel said. (This was reported in Russell’s book The Man Who Knew Too Much .) This startling information that the H. L. Hunt family had purchased the original of the Zapruder film is not incompatible with any of the foregoing testimonies. I had ruled out that a bootleg copy could have been purchased by the Hunt family from Jamison Film or one of its employees. I also was greatly inclined to rule out the possibility that H. L. Hunt could have obtained a bootleg copy from Eastman Kodak. So, who might have sold Rothermel a copy of the film on the night of November 22? Referring to Exhibit 12-2A we see that the four total copies made that night (one original plus three duplicate prints) were distributed as follows: • Two copies to Secret Service agent Forrest Sorrels, of which one copy was sent to FBI laboratory in Washington, D.C., and one was given to inspector Thomas Kelley, who loaned it to the FBI, which later returned it. • Two copies (original plus one duplicate) were retained by Abraham Zapruder who took them"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"home with him. According to Life magazine’ s Richard Stolley, he obtained these two copies from Zapruder the next day and sent the original to Chicago and, presumably, also sent the duplicate copy. From the above we see that one possibility that seems open for Rothermel to have obtained a copy would have been from inspector Thomas Kelley, or someone else in the Secret Service office on November 23. Plausibly, H. L. Hunt could have obtained this copy, had a duplicate made, and later returned it to the Secret Service in Dallas before it was sent to the FBI laboratory in Washington, D.C., on November 27, 1963. So, if one copy was sent to the FBI on the evening of November 22 as noted in Exhibit 12-2A, H. L. Hunt must have obtained his copy the next day, then returned it to the Secret Service within four days. This would mean that Rothermel was mistaken when he said he purchased a copy on the evening of November 22—it was more likely November 23. The next item of interest is how Life magazine enters the story. After many phone calls, Life’s representative, Richard Stolley, finally got through to Abraham Zapruder at around midnight on November 22. He asked to meet with Zapruder to view the film. Zapruder declined, saying he was exhausted, but agreed to meet with Stolley at 9 a.m. the next day (Saturday). The next morning, Stolley arrived at 8 a.m., an hour early, to meet with Zapruder. He and some Secret Service agents viewed the film on what Stolley described as a rickety projector. Stolley later wrote that in viewing the film he saw the fatal head shot with Kennedy’s brains being blown out. (He did not describe, however, the direction of the eruption of brain matter.) After viewing the film, Stolley entered into negotiations with Zapruder to purchase print rights. He started with an offer of $15,000 and within ten minutes had settled for $50,000. Zapruder would later testify to the Warren Commission that Life magazine paid only $25,000 for the film, when, in fact, at the time of his testimony, Zapruder had entered into a contract to receive a total of $150,000, including all rights. Zapruder testified that he turned the original over to Stolley for Life magazine’s use. According to Stolley, on November 23 the original was then sent by courier to Life’s Chicago office, where it was studied on a Moviola projector and ten black-and-white prints were made. (A Moviola is a standard machine used in the film industry for viewing and planning the editing of a film.) While the original was in Chicago, a duplicate (perhaps the copy that Stolley got from Zapruder along with the original) was shown to Time-Life executives in New York City. Present at the viewing was Life’s publisher, C. D. Jackson, who was formerly with the CIA and was a friend of Allen Dulles; at that time he was serving as Life’s contact with the CIA ( Life correspondents would act as unofficial agents for the CIA in various foreign countries). C. D. Jackson was “so upset” by the head-wound sequence that he proposed all rights be purchased from Zapruder and the film withheld from public viewing. Thus, an additional $100,000 was added to Zapruder’s contract, making it a total of $150,000. On November 29, 1963, Life published an issue showing selected frames from the Zapruder film. Not shown were any of the frames in the segments that have been put under question in this book (frames 302, 303, 316, 317). On October 2, 1964, Life published an issue showing the fatal head shot, but again not showing frames 302, 303, 316, 317. One month before Life published the fatal head shot, the Warren Commission published its report showing frames 171 through 334, including the suspect segments; but they were poor-quality black-and- white prints and it was very difficult to see rapid head turns or detect frame removal at the critical points. Not until thirty years later were the rapid head turns noticed, although close scrutiny does show them in the Warren Report prints if one looks for them. That it took so long is, in itself, quite amazing. It is worthwhile now to examine closely Abraham Zapruder’s testimony to the Warren Commission concerning the price he was paid by Life magazine:"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" Mr. Liebeler. Well, I am not going to even urge you to answer the question. We will ask it and if you would rather not answer it—the Commission feels it would be helpful. Mr. Zapruder. I received $25,000, as you know, and I have given that to the Firemen’s and Policemen’s Benevolence with a suggestion for Mrs. Tippit. You know that? Mr. Liebeler. I don’t know that—you received $25,000? Mr. Zapruder. $25,000 was paid and I have given it to the Firemen’s and Policemen’s fund. Mr. Liebeler. You gave the whole $25,000? Mr. Zapruder. Yes. This was all over the world. I got letters from all over the world and newspapers—I mean letters from all over the world. It was all over the world—I am surprised— that you don’t know it—I don’t like to talk about it too much. Mr. Liebeler. We appreciate your answer very much. Mr. Zapruder. I haven’t done anything, the way I have given it, at a time like this. W.C. Vol. VII, pp. 575-576 Zapruder was not telling the complete truth in his testimony to the Warren Commission. The question is, why? I myself do not see anything particularly sinister in this. Zapruder, it would seem, was simply unable to admit that he had gotten so much money (equivalent to $1 million in today’s money) for his few seconds of film of the assassination of the president of the United States. The point is, however, that Zapruder was not telling the truth and, moreover, he was promoting a false image of himself. Therefore, it casts doubt on other segments of his testimony, although there is no substantial reason to believe that the balance of the testimony was not truthful, at least as Zapruder remembered, or as questions were asked. Zapruder probably hedged only on the question of how much money he was paid. There is also reason to question FBI agent Forrest Sorrels’ truthfulness. Vincent Palamara, in his book The Third Alternative , notes that Sorrels had told the FBI that he “remained at Parkland Hospital until the president’s body was taken to Love Field.” Sorrell’s statement simply is not true. Still photos in the Warren Commission Report reveal that Sorrels returned to Dealey Plaza. Back at the murder scene, Sorrels proceeded to find two star government witnesses who claimed to have seen gunfire from the “Oswald window.” He also discovered “that Oswald was supposedly the only employee missing from the School Book Depository” (several, in fact, were missing); and Sorrels, as we have noted, took Abraham Zapruder to Eastman Kodak to make copies of the film. Sorrels was either lying or greatly confused about what happened that afternoon. So those who question Paul Rothermel’s statements should equally question statements of Zapruder and Sorrels. What is to be believed? What can we make of this? One of my objectives was to see if the opportunity were present for conspirators to delete frames from the film. To analyze this I divided the time line into two segments: first, from the time the president was shot until a copy of the film was turned over to Life , and, second, the time between Life receiving the film and publishing the first frames. The reason for this differentiation is important: If frames were altered after Life received its copy, then it would seem indisputable that Life must have known about it or have been involved in it. My research, it will be shown, is that, although extremely unlikely, it was possible for the film to have been edited and frames deleted before Life received its copy. As long as the conspirators had control of all of the other copies, their secret would remain intact among themselves. But, in my opinion, it is more likely that one or two individuals within Life were privy to knowledge that the Zapruder film was altered while it was in the hands of the FBI or others. Cooperation from these individuals could have been given to the government for nonsinister reasons: that is, they could have"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"cooperated for legitimate national security purposes, at least as far as they knew. To make it clear, I am not alleging that Life, as an organization, was part of a conspiracy to murder the president. But we should keep in mind that Henry Luce, chairman of Life, and his wife, Clare Boothe Luce, were deeply involved in the financing of anti-Castro operations in the Caribbean and were involved in right-wing and anti- Communist activities in 1963 and beyond. Another insightful nugget of information recently reported is that Clare Boothe Luce seems to have once had an affair with none other than Allen Dulles. [58] When we consider that Allen Dulles was a close personal friend of C. D. Jackson of Life magazine who, as noted, was ex-CIA, it becomes entirely plausible that C. D. Jackson could have been enlisted by the CIA to avoid exposure of national security secrets, without him or whoever assisted him necessarily being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate the president. What I am writing here are my opinions, based on analysis of the information that I have developed. There may be alternative explanations. When I first started looking for missing frames, I examined my 35mm copy of the negative of the film for splices. I found none. But at that time I did not know how films were edited and frames removed. I learned more when I talked to a senior film editor, Leon Carrere, and showed him the work I was doing. He took me to a bookstore in Hollywood where I obtained several books on film editing, and he pointed out to me how frames are removed from film. One method is to cut the film and make either hot overlaying splices or butt splices, which are easily detected. But another method (not easily detectable without the original to compare to) is to use an optical printer in which the film is not cut. An optical printer, in simplistic terms, projects through one copy of the film over to a blank negative; only the selected frames that are to be left in the film are transferred to the negative. Mr. Carrere told me that this is common practice for editing films, and was common in 1963. Also, when he examined my questionable Zapruder frames, he agreed that it did appear that frames had been deleted, resulting in the rapid head movements. He said it was commonplace in editing films to delete scenes or to speed up scenes by deleting frames, or to rearrange scenes for whatever end result was desired. He said that the frames that I was talking about could easily have been edited out of the film overnight as long as there was a film laboratory with an optical printer. [59] There was a laboratory in existence in Dallas in 1963 that I thought might have this capability. It was the firm of Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall which, incredibly, had employed Lee Harvey Oswald for a few weeks in early 1963. This film lab did a considerable amount of aerial reconnaissance film development work for the U.S. government. In particular, top-secret work. [60] Whether or not this firm had an optical printer at that time I have not determined, but it seems safe to assume that they did. Again, I am not alleging that Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall was involved in the conspiracy. I am only pointing out that the capability might have been available in the city of Dallas to edit the film for removal of frames. However, if we get into attempting to determine whether or not mysterious blobs could have been matte- inserted or painted in to simulate JFK’s head wounds, it is another matter. Mr. Carrere told me this would probably have taken considerably more time than was available on the night of November 22, 1963. [61] This is a very important area of research. But for the moment I simply want to show that frames were deleted from the Zapruder film and explore whether it was possible that frames were deleted within that period of time between when the film was shot and when Life took it over. If Abraham Zapruder was not involved in the conspiracy (and I am as certain as I can be that he was not), it would have been necessary for the conspirators to conceal from Zapruder what they were doing; either that, or intimidate Zapruder into not telling all he knew about possession of the film on November 22. But, barring that, it would have been necessary for the plotters to perform the intricate task of forging the film and then substituting a forged copy of the film overnight, wherever Zapruder kept the film the"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"night of November 22. Erwin Schwartz told Bartholomew and me that Zapruder took all the copies home with him. Richard Stolley had written that he thought the film was kept in Zapruder’s safe overnight at his office. In either case, the film was reviewed the next morning by Secret Service agents and Richard Stolley of Life magazine. And the question is, was the incriminating evidence in the film already deleted? Or did the people who were looking at the film not detect anything suspicious? When I interviewed Erwin Schwartz, I asked him several questions about what he saw on the film when he first viewed it in its original state at Eastman Kodak. [62] I asked him if he noticed whether the limousine had stopped or slowed down at the time of the fatal head shot. He said no, he hadn’t noticed. I was surprised at this because of the multiple witnesses who said they saw the limousine either slow down or come to a stop. I also asked him to describe what he saw at the instant of the fatal head shot. His answer was very descriptive. He said he saw Kennedy’s head suddenly whip around to the left (counter- clockwise). I also asked him if he saw the explosion of blood and brains out of the head. He replied that he did. I asked him if he noticed which direction the eruption went. He pointed back over his left shoulder. He said, “It went this way.” I said, you mean it went to the left and rear? He said yes. Bartholomew then asked him, “Are you sure that you didn’t see the blood and brains going up and to the front?” Schwartz said, “No; it was to the left and rear.” We went over this several times with him to be certain that he was clear on this point. He was very clear. Of course, Schwartz’s statement that the blood and brains went back to the rear and left was completely consistent with all of the eyewitnesses who said they saw the rear of Kennedy’s head blow out and brain and blood go to the rear. It was also consistent with Dallas motorcycle policeman Bobby Hargis’s testimony that he was riding to the rear and left of the limousine and was splattered with blood and brains. It is also consistent with the location of a large bone fragment—the “Harper fragment” (to be discussed in Chapter 14)—that was found to the rear and left of the point of the fatal head shot and was identified as being occipital bone—bone from the rear of Kennedy’s head. So here we have testimony from a man who first saw the original Zapruder film (he said he looked at it at least fifteen times over the weekend) and who (a) did not see the limousine slow down or stop and (b) saw the eruption of blood and brains in a direction opposite what we now see on the Zapruder film. When we questioned Schwartz further on whether or not he saw the limousine slow down or stop, he said that perhaps he could have missed it (maybe transfixed by the drama of the head exploding to the rear). Also, interestingly, when Schwartz saw the Oliver Stone film JFK he apparently did not observe anything different from what he had originally seen. But now he was telling us that the blood and brains went backward over the left shoulder instead of forward and upward as is shown in the Oliver Stone film, which is the Warren Commission version. The point here is that it seems quite plausible that observers of the Zapruder film would not be able to detect the subtleties that we are talking about. This thought is reinforced by the fact that it took thirty years before anyone noticed Greer’s rapid head turn. It takes a very close scrutiny, frame by frame, to detect these subtleties. Therefore it is plausible to me that those who viewed Zapruder’s film in Zapruder’s office on Saturday morning could have been looking at a copy of the original and not notice these subtleties. The forgeries could have been completed afterward and no one would have known the difference, even the technicians at Life magazine as they processed and published the film. However, if the forgery of the film was done in Washington, D.C., then, in my opinion, it would most likely (compared to other possible alternatives) have been necessary for someone at Life to cooperate with the government to substitute the forged for the real before Life published frames of the fatal head shot. These frames were not published until ten months after the assassination. We can now get back to examining the significance of H. L. Hunt’s purchase of the first copy of the film (assuming Paul Rothermel was telling the truth to Dick Russell). It could be explained simply that H. L. Hunt was extremely curious about the assassination and wanted to stay on top of events. In Chapter 24,"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"I will discuss the possibility that H. L. Hunt may have feared that he would be targeted as a suspect in the Kennedy assassination because of his venomous series of public attacks on John Kennedy. If H. L. Hunt did have an unaltered copy of the Zapruder film, he certainly had a very valuable piece of evidence because he would have blackmail proof that the government had altered the film. This might explain why there was very little investigation conducted by the FBI concerning H. L. Hunt. By now I had learned enough about the chain of possession of the Zapruder film to know that it was riddled with possibilities for deviousness. H. L. Hunt could have succeeded in purchasing a bootleg copy; and at least in remote hypothesis, frame removal could have been accomplished overnight while the copies of the film were allegedly in Zapruder’s home or office, although this would have required black- bag agents substituting forged copies in his home or office, or his silent permission. But I concluded that, in all likelihood, the film was altered in Washington, D.C. when more time was available. The scenario of altering the film in Dallas, although possible, appeared too convoluted and loaded with doubt, whereas alteration of the film after it left Dallas was very plausible. Without resolving these issues with complete, satisfying clarity, my attention was diverted temporarily to the examination of another motion picture film of the assassination taken by Orville Nix, who was standing on the opposite side of Elm Street from Abraham Zapruder. The Nix Film Having proven to my satisfaction that the Zapruder film had been altered by removal of frames within the segment of frames that I examined (frames 313 to 330), I wondered what the Nix film would show. I reasoned that if it had not been altered in a similar fashion to the Zapruder film it would show a slowing down or stopping of the limousine if, as I believed, the testimonies of the eyewitnesses were correct. I obtained a set of slides of the Nix film and made prints on a Canon laser copier. The Nix film is of very poor quality and of limited use in any analysis; however, it did provide a means of calculating limousine speed. By measuring the rate of advance of a point on the limousine (the rear edge of the left front tire) in reference to a fixed point in the background (the corner of a concrete wall), I was able to prepare a graph showing the speed (shown in Exhibit 12-3)."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Exhibit 12-3. Apparent Speed of Limousine on Nix Film. The graph is almost a perfectly straight line, indicating a uniform rate of speed. I had hoped to see an abrupt change in the rate of speed as was described by the eyewitnesses who said they had seen the limousine come almost to a complete stop at or near the time of the fatal head shot. But such was not the case. This indicated that the Nix film had also been altered to make it more or less match the Zapruder film. I calculated the rate of speed of the limousine in the Nix film and it was 9.4 miles per hour based on the assumption that the film was shot at 18.5 frames per second, as had been reported by the FBI. This compared to a speed of the limousine in the Zapruder film of about 11 miles per hour. I wondered if this difference was of significance or simply due to an inability to calculate the speed accurately using the somewhat crude measurements. The quality of the Nix film is so poor that it is not possible to make good judgments about body movements, rapid head turns, or explosion of the head. Its usefulness seems to be limited to a calculation of rate of speed. The fact of uniform speed of the limousine, as shown on the Nix film, was confirmed when I obtained documents from the National Archives which showed that photographic analysts had used multiple-exposure techniques on the Nix frames showing the limousine advancing at a uniform rate of speed. Also they had calculated the speed at 8.5 miles per hour compared to my 9.4 miles per hour. We now had the speed of the limousine in the Nix film at 22 percent slower than in the Zapruder film. This appears to be significant. The next step was to determine at what geographical location the Nix film could have been altered. I found an excellent history and chronology of the Nix film in a new book, Pictures of the Pain by Richard B. Trask. In the book the author had meticulously documented the chronology of the Nix film. Orville Nix voluntarily turned his film over to FBI agent Joe B. Abernathy on December 1, 1963, requesting it to be returned immediately. This piece of information was very significant because, if the Nix film were altered, it would have been altered while in the control of the FBI. Upon receipt of the Nix film (with his camera) the FBI field office had a copy of the film made at Jamison Film in Dallas. This copy was forwarded to the FBI laboratory in Washington, D.C. It was returned to Orville Nix on December 4, 1963. Therefore, the FBI had about three days to work on the film if they altered it. It was interesting to note that Orville Nix contacted the FBI office in mid-March 1964 and requested an additional print. He stated that the copy that was returned to him by the FBI “does not appear clear.” Nix was provided with an additional copy. Nix didn’t get his camera back from the FBI until June 2, 1964, after many requests. When he got the camera back, he complained about its condition (it had a missing spool, loosened screws, and an inoperative footage indicator). The FBI"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"reimbursed Nix for repair of the camera. The Nix family would later reveal that they were suspicious that the film had been altered while it was in the possession of the FBI. Orville Nix was never called as a witness to the Warren Commission, in spite of the fact that he had a clear view of the fatal shot and of the grassy knoll area. He had stated that he thought the shot came from behind the grassy knoll. Maybe this was one of the reasons he was not called upon to testify. It made sense to me that if the Zapruder film had been altered, then the FBI would have altered the Nix film to make it compatible as much as possible. The alteration of the Nix film would have been even more undetectable than that of the Zapruder film because the Nix film was of such poor quality—details could not be observed. Its alteration would simply have been to remove frames and create a uniform speed of the limousine. If one can believe that the Zapruder film was altered, then it is an easy step to believe that the Nix film was altered. And the proof of alteration of the Zapruder film is to me beyond a reasonable doubt."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Exhibit 12-4. Frame 42 of Muchmore film. (W.C.

"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Now, examination of all of the evidence led me to the conclusion that the alteration of the Zapruder film (and the Nix film) took place while in the hands of the FBI, not in Dallas. Another reason to believe that the forgery of the film took place in the hands of the FBI in Washington is the extensive, time-consuming special-effects film techniques that would have been required. A mysterious blob appears on the front of Kennedy’s face, and there is an explosion of matter directed upward and toward the front, but the film shows no matter erupting toward the rear, which is in conflict with the testimonies of many eyewitnesses. Robert Groden, a promoter of the authenticity of the Zapruder film, had pointed out to me that a third film, shot by Marie Much-more, could possibly contradict my conclusion that the Zapruder film had been altered. The Muchmore film was taken with a greater close-up than the Nix film. Unfortunately, it offers a very brief Elm Street sequence, as Mrs. Muchmore was moving to a new vantage point on Elm Street when the shots were fired. (Frame 42, above, was copied from the Warren Commission Report Vol. XVIII, p. 84.) The film begins around Zapruder frame 280 and ends as Clint Hill is approaching the limousine. Due to its brief sequence on Elm Street, it offers no corroboration or contradiction of the Zapruder film. The few frames shown (three) in the Warren Commission Report are not enough to reach a conclusion. The Film Forgery Process At this point I had proven to my satisfaction that frames had been removed from the Zapruder film and that the opportunity was present for the film to have been altered while in the possession of the FBI. From the beginning, as a matter of diligence, I had felt that I should investigate the process and mechanisms by which the forgery could have been accomplished. I was fortunate to obtain considerable help from several experts. A key point in film editing is that it is very unlikely that the 8mm film would have been altered without first enlarging it to at least a 16mm format or, preferably, 35mm. This was pointed out to me by George Kendall, retired chief engineer of Moviola Corporation, the leading manufacturer of film editing machines in 1963. Their standard machines were for 16mm and 35mm film. Another key point is that the 8mm film used by Zapruder was Kodachrome II. I obtained this information from James Silverberg, attorney for the Zapruder family estate. His law firm has been responsible for all legal and contract matters concerning the film. Silverberg told me he had established that the film was Kodachrome II by inspection of the markings on the “original” (now in preservation in the National Archives) and after consulting with Eastman Kodak engineers. Also, close examination of the Zapruder frames shown in the Warren Commission Report in Volume XVIII show Kodachrome II identification markings. A third key point is that 16mm film or 35mm was not (and is not) available in Kodachrome II. I obtained this information from Dr. Rod Ryan, retired scientist from Eastman Kodak Company. Therefore the enlarged film for editing would not have been on Kodachrome II. With these three basic parameters, it was obvious that the forgery process would have involved these minimal steps: (1) enlarge the 8mm camera original to 16mm or 35mm; (2) edit the enlarged film on an editing machine, producing a work print which would show splice marks; (3) reduce back to 8mm on Kodachrome II camera stock, circa 1963, so that no splice marks were detectable. In consultation with Leon Carrere (motion picture film editor), Peter Silverman (retired chief engineer of Consolidated Film Laboratories in Los Angeles), and others, I determined that all three steps could have been accomplished with an optical printer in conjunction with a Moviola machine."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"I now wondered if the original film in the National Archives was, in fact, circa 1963 film stock manufactured at a time compatible with November 22, 1963. I obtained film edge markings from James Silverberg; Dr. Ryan told me they would reveal the date of manufacture of the 8mm film by Eastman Kodak. The edge markings were a series of Greek letters, periods, slashes, and alphabetical letters. I informed Dr. Ryan of the markings and, after he consulted his files, he told me the film came from a large production roll manufactured by Eastman Kodak in 1961. He also told me that this date would have been compatible with Abraham Zapruder shooting his film on November 22, 1963. In the course of our conversations, Dr. Ryan told me that, as far as he could remember, there were only three independent film laboratories in the United States in 1963 that could have processed Kodachrome II film. He explained that the process was very complicated, involving many steps and requiring special equipment. He also said that there was not an independent laboratory in the Dallas area that had that capability, and that neither the FBI nor the CIA had the capability to process Kodachrome II film. This seemed to be potentially important information because, if I ruled out Eastman Kodak having been involved in the final step of the forgery—wit-tingly or unwittingly—then it could have been accomplished in only three private laboratories in the United States. Dr. Ryan remembered that there was one such laboratory in Los Angeles, another in Chicago, and the third in New York City. He said he would check his records and let me know for certain if these were the only laboratories and their exact locations. A Meeting with Dr. Roderick Ryan I became acquainted with Dr. Ryan by way of introduction by Peter Silverman, who had been introduced to me by George Kendall, who had been introduced to me by my friend, Robert Casey. This chain of introductions is typical of the way a network of sources and expertise is somewhat readily developed by those who are interested in investigating a complex subject that has a wide base of information and interest. In the JFK assassination, in particular, there was a keen interest and willing helpfulness from almost everybody I contacted. People wanted to know and understand what happened in this dreadful, horrible murder of the president of the United States. The mystery continues, after thirty- three years, to puzzle and challenge our sensibilities. When I became focused on the Zapruder film and saw the high probability that it had been altered, I felt it would be very important for me to find a consultant or individual who was nationally recognized as a technical expert in motion picture films. Dr. Ryan proved to be someone who filled that need. (Another invaluable technical expert, Leon Carrere, has previously been discussed.) My conversations with Dr. Ryan started on the telephone in early 1994. It was not until February 14, 1995 that I drove up to Los Angeles to meet with him personally. [2009 Update: After reading the first edition of this book, Dr. Ryan sent to me a resume of his professional career. He offered no other changes or corrections in this chapter , which I consider to be significant. Dr. Ryan has a Ph.D. from the University of Southern California, majoring in cinema/communications. He was with Eastman Kodak Company in Hollywood, California, from 1947 to 1986 where he held various engineering and executive positions, including regional director of engineering services—motion picture division. His entire career has been devoted to motion picture film technology. He has received numerous awards, honors, and commendations, including a Scientific and"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Engineering Award (1981) and a Medal of Commendation (1990) in appreciation for outstanding service from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He is a Fellow of the British Kinematograph Sound and Television Society. A Life Fellow of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers and a recipient of the prestigious Herbert T. Kalmus Gold Medal, for outstanding achievement in color motion pictures. Dr. Ryan’s credentials include authorship of several books, technical papers, and articles on motion picture technology. Listed in “Who’s Who in Engineering” (1973); listed in “Who’s Who in Technology” (1986). At the time, he was retired from Eastman Kodak and was active as a consultant in his field. His advice to me was provided without charge.] What I sought from Dr. Ryan was a short education on the processes and equipment that would have been required for the alteration of the Zapruder film in 1963. I was interested in the state of technology at that time as well as the availability of the necessary equipment, how special or unique it was, and what entities or organizations would have had such equipment at the time. I also thought that perhaps Dr. Ryan would be willing to state some of his opinions on whether or not the Zapruder film had been altered, although earlier I had decided that I would primarily be seeking technical expertise on processes and equipment. But, of course, if he were willing to give some opinions on the authenticity of the film itself, it would be most welcome. Dr. Ryan outlined the process for editing 8mm Kodachrome II film that would have been required in this case; it involves making an enlargement to 16mm (or 35mm), editing, and then reducing back to 8mm on Kodachrome II stock. From the information he gave me I constructed a process flow diagram which is shown in Exhibit 12-5. Dr. Ryan later reviewed and approved the diagram in its final form. "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Exhibit 12-5 . Process for editing 8mm Kodachrome II film and returning to 8mm Kodachrome II print. "},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" The equipment required for the above procedure is: (a) Optical printer for enlarging 8mm to 16mm or 35mm, or reducing 16mm or 35mm to 8mm. (b) A 35mm or 16mm film viewing machine for editing purposes. (This would probably have been a Moviola machine, but other 16mm makes were available in 1963.) (c) A contact printer for 16mm or 35mm film. (These were commonly available in 1963.) (d) Kodachrome II process for final print (available only at Eastman Kodak laboratories throughout the U.S. and at a small number of licensed facilities). Dr. Ryan had checked in his files and found that there were relatively few independent laboratories available in 1963 that could have done the 8mm/16mm optical printing. One company was George W. Colburn Laboratories in Chicago, Illinois. Also there were Calvin Laboratories in Kansas City and Hollywood Valley Film Laboratories in Los Angeles, both of which were no longer in business. Dr. Ryan thought that Colburn Laboratories was still in business in Chicago, being run by George Colburn’s brother, Robert Colburn. He also told me that the Technicolor Company in Burbank, California, at one time had the capability to process Kodachrome II film. The reason for the limited availability of Kodachrome process technology in 1963 is that until the mid-1950s the technology was not made available from Eastman Kodak for independent laboratory licensing other than at their own laboratories. Dr. Ryan repeated that only a few companies had purchased the technology from Eastman Kodak at that time. He said equipment could have been purchased piecemeal to assemble the process, but he could see no reason why anyone would want to do that. Dr. Ryan pointed out that the Kodachrome II process is relatively complicated compared to the process for Ektachrome film. The Kodachrome II process takes nine different steps requiring special equipment, as opposed to only five steps for the Ektachrome process. I was surprised to learn from Dr. Ryan that no government facilities had Kodachrome II processing in 1963 or even today. Dr. Ryan was certain on this point. I had always assumed that the National Photographic Interpretation Center, the laboratories in the FBI, or other government agencies would have such equipment. But Dr. Ryan said that this was not so. Only Eastman Kodak and a few licensed private laboratories could have done the final step of development back to Kodachrome II film stock. At first, both Dr. Ryan and I thought this would narrow down considerably the entities that could have altered the film. But on further discussion I suggested that, inasmuch as only the last step in the process involved the need for Kodachrome II processing capability, perhaps whoever did the forgery ended up with Kodachrome II exposed film with no visible splices (as shown in Exhibit 12-5), and then simply sent the film to either an Eastman Kodak laboratory or a commercial laboratory that had the Kodachrome II process and had it developed. I asked Dr. Ryan if he felt that Eastman Kodak or a commercial laboratory would have taken particular note of the film. He said no, that at one time there were government regulations on pornography which required photographic processors to inspect the film they were developing, but by 1963 those had long since been abandoned. He said any lab would probably take a roll of 8mm film and simply develop it without even looking at it and give it back to the owner. He also said that laboratories had contracts for secret and confidential work with the government and would normally process whatever package of materials was sent to them without looking at it. In sum, this left the field almost wide open for altering and processing the Zapruder film. The only narrow slot in the field would be the laboratories mentioned earlier for enlarging 8mm film to either 16mm or 35mm. I wondered if there would be any point in contacting these companies to see if they had received orders in 1963 or 1964 for processing or enlarging the Zapruder film, or returning enlarged film"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"back to 8mm. After discussing it with Dr. Ryan, we both concluded there would be no such records available. It was too long ago and it would probably be a fruitless effort of investigation. Also, there was no reason to believe that some government film laboratories did not have the capability to enlarge 8mm film on optical printers. I asked Dr. Ryan about the capability in 1963 for special-effects film editing such as that now available with modern computer technology. He said that, as far as he knew, digital computer capability to create special effects similar to what is now being done was not commercially available in 1963. It was not until 1973 that this type of computer equipment was developed, using rudimentary digital equipment. It was under development at Hughes Aircraft Company in Culver City, California, in 1973. Dr. Ryan noted, however, that even in 1973 it would have taken a complete room full of digital equipment to do what is now being done on a desktop computer in special-effects editing. I showed Dr. Ryan the critical frames of the Zapruder film that I had been studying. I showed him frames 302 and 303 and pointed out the blur in the stationary background figures as opposed to the sharp focus of the limousine in 302, and how the blur of the background figures suddenly disappeared in 303 while the limousine remained in sharp focus. I asked Dr. Ryan what he thought could cause this. He stated, to my satisfaction, that “the limousine is moving in 302 and standing still in 303.” I considered this statement from Dr. Ryan to be extremely important corroboration of my analysis. In a later telephone conversation with Dr. Ryan, I asked him again about this, if he had more thoughts on the subject. He told me that he had shown 302 and 303 to his son, who is also in motion picture film technology, and they both agreed that the limousine was moving in 302 and standing still in 303—the reason being that Zapruder was panning his camera to keep up with the moving limousine in 302, resulting in the blur of background figures, which came into sharp focus in 303 when the limousine was stopped and Zapruder was no longer panning, thus eliminating the blur in the background figures. I asked Dr. Ryan if there was any other reason that could explain the blur of the background figures in 302. He said he had thought of this but could not think of a logical reason as to why these figures would be blurred other than that the limousine was moving and Zapruder was panning his camera to keep up with the limousine, thus blurring the background figures. I asked him if it would be possible in special effects to create this blur of the background figures. He said yes, but he had thought about that and could think of no logical reason why anyone would want to do it. (Even if they had, this would still be alteration of the film.) I began to see that the blur of the background figures in 302 and the absence of blur in 303 amounted to very significant evidence of forgery of the Zapruder film, and strongly reinforces the initial discovery of the rapid head turn between 316 and 317 and 302 and 303. The two phenomena occurring in precisely the same frame was very clear and convincing evidence, indeed! I then asked Dr. Ryan to inspect the mysterious blobs on JFK’s face and in the successive frames after the fatal head shot. I asked if this could be explained in any way other than alteration of film. He spent some time looking at the series of frames, thinking that he might be able to find possibilities of light reflection from adjacent objects or surfaces that could cause the appearance of the blobs. He found none. He looked at Jacqueline Kennedy’s head or hands as a possibility of light reflection as well as parts of the limousine. He found none. I asked if this could have been done with traveling matte inserts. He said it didn’t look like traveling matte inserts to him. He did note, however, that traveling matte insert techniques were in use in the film industry as early as the 1930s, although it was done with manual techniques as opposed to the current digital computer techniques. I then asked Dr. Ryan what these blobs were if they were not traveling matte inserts. He said it looked as if the blobs had been painted in. This came as a surprise to me because I had just about concluded that it had been done with traveling matte inserts based on my previous research. I noted to Dr. Ryan that some researchers had argued that these blobs could not have been painted in because they appear as three-dimensional when viewed through a stereoscopic viewer. He said that painted special effects can be made to appear three-dimensional when"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"viewed stereoscopically. (Some researchers who have viewed the blobs with a stereoscope have noted that they have a three-dimensional effect. Also, just looking at the blobs, one can see that they are three- dimensional.) [In the spring of 1996, Dr. David Mantik and I met concerning a new project he had undertaken on the Zapruder film. He told me that his work (see Chapter 14) was now essentially done on the Kennedy x- rays and that he was pursuing what he thought would be additional scientific proof, beyond my work, of alteration of the Zapruder film. Mantik’s work involved photographic information between the sprocket holes, as was published in Life magazine. His question to me was whether an optical printer would capture that information. I promised him I would check into that while he was away for the summer on a medical exchange program to New Zealand. I called Dr. Ryan and he was certain that optical printers for the 8mm film were available to capture all the information on the film, but suggested that I call Robert Coburn in Chicago who would be able to provide a completely authoritative answer. I called Mr. Coburn and he told me that his optical printers in those days could certainly capture all of the information on 8mm film, between the sprocket holes and even beyond the edges of the film if one wanted. I asked Mr. Coburn if his company enlarged the Zapruder film for Life magazine in the days following the assassination. He replied that he did remember that his firm enlarged an 8mm film for Life concerning the JFK assassination, but couldn’t recall if it was the Zapruder film. I asked him if there would be any records available that would show work they did for Life. He said no; his company was no longer in existence, had gone out with the end of the era of 8mm film, and all such detailed records had been disposed of.] By February 1994, I had reached the point in my investigation of the Zapruder film that I felt I could go on to a broader investigation of the assassination conspiracy. But when I returned to San Diego, I received a telephone call from Charles Marler who suggested that we meet with Dr. David Mantik and Jim DiEugenio, author of the book Destiny Betrayed on the Kennedy assassination, to look over our research on the Zapruder film. I agreed, and we decided to meet at Dr. Mantik’s summer home in Idyllwild, in Southern California’s San Jacinto Mountains. The Meeting at Idyllwild On Saturday, February 24, 1995, we all met at Dr. Mantik’s home. DiEugenio brought along with him three researchers, all of whom had helped him in his work. We spent the day looking at the Zapruder slides, high-resolution blow-ups, graphs, and other items of my research material, and had a lively general discussion of the JFK assassination evidence. This meeting had been precipitated by a challenge that had been laid down by two other researchers in the eastern United States and an author who had questioned the authenticity of the rapid head-turn experiments that Marler and I had made. These two researchers had gone to the National Archives and looked at slides available there from the Zapruder film, and had made their own observations, which did not agree with my and Marler’s estimates of the position of Greer’s head angles at frames 302, 303 and 316, 317. Marler felt that he, Dr. Mantik, and I should get together among ourselves and make a final determination of the accuracy of our own observations. Dr. Mantik had obtained copies of the same slides from the National Archives that my challengers"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"were examining, and he showed them to me. I noted that frame 317 was misnumbered. (Earlier I had noted this in the Zapruder family attorney’s office in Washington, D.C.; frame 317 was misnumbered in their collection which they said they had obtained from the National Archives.) I determined that what is numbered as frame 317 in the National Archives is actually frame 308. Marler and I had carefully confirmed that the slides we were looking at were accurately numbered. We had confirmed that the slides agreed with what was shown in the Warren Commission Report. As noted previously, I also confirmed that the slides upon which our analysis was based were in proper sequence, comparing them to a copy of the original film strip provided to me by Zapruder’s attorney. The fact that our challengers were looking at the wrong slide in frame 317 was relayed to them a few days later with the hope that this would explain their confusion. [63] In any event, we spent the day at Idyllwild brainstorming various aspects of the Kennedy assassination, looking at the slides and checking my work. We spiritedly disagreed on several aspects of the assassination evidence as to the plotters, but unanimously agreed that the angles and speeds that Marler and I had calculated for William Greer’s head turn were correct. As a point of irony, three weeks after the meeting in Idyllwild I received a letter from Marler relaying to me that Dr. Mantik had sent him a copy of a page from Harold Weisberg’s book Photographic Whitewash , in which Weisberg had noted that in 1966 he had discovered that frame 317 in the National Archive collection was misnumbered and was actually a frame taken about twenty frames earlier. This error, despite having been identified to the National Archives by Weisberg, remained in place in 1995, twenty-nine years later, and was still creating confusion among researchers. I wondered why frame 317 was misnumbered in the collection available to the public in the National Archives. It demonstrated to me a possible reason why no one had discovered the rapid head turn between 316 and 317 over all these years. To my knowledge, these frames had never appeared in Life or any national publication. Thus when researchers went to the National Archives they would only end up confused. This would be true even for experienced researchers. I noted that it was indeed a peculiar coincidence that this critical frame would be misnumbered. It was when looking at frame 317 that I first noticed the extreme head turn from frame 316. (In the Warren Commission Report, the poor-quality black-and-white copies of the Zapruder film do not clearly show this head turn, although, on close scrutiny, one can see it, but only if looking for it.) I pondered if it were not more likely that frame 317 had been deliberately misnumbered by someone along the way because that person knew that it would be the one that would jump out most obviously to future researchers who would be looking, as I did, at the position of Greer’s head during and after the fatal head shot. (When I found the rapid head turn at 317, I was not looking for it. I was examining the film to see if Greer’s testimony—that he was not looking at Kennedy when he was shot—was true.) Only by accident did I make the discovery of the rapid head turn at 317. I also noted that Harold Weisberg had not noticed the rapid head turn at 317. I suspected that Weisberg did not notice it because he probably did not have 317 available to examine. All he had available to him was the poor reproduction of 317 in the Warren Commission Report. I wondered if the frames that would most starkly reveal the forgery of the Zapruder film had systematically been kept from the American public over the years. None of them had been published in Life. Only poor-quality prints were published in the Warren Commission Report. And only dedicated researchers who would go to Washington, D.C., and dig the frames out of the National Archives would be in a position to make the discovery. Unfortunately, even those dedicated researchers would not find frame 317. Summary of Key Points in Chapters 11 and 12"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" 1) There are frames missing in the Zapruder film between 302 and 303 and 316 and 317. This is evidenced by the impossibly rapid head turn of the limousine driver, William Greer. 2) Extensive tests conducted on two human subjects show that neither was able even to come close to duplicating the feat of William Greer in these frames. The test subjects included a top amateur athlete and a professional athlete. Even when cued for the turn in advance, the most rapid head turn of the athletes measured in our tests was only 50 percent as rapid as Greer’s feat. In most of our tests, it was less that 33 percent as rapid. 3) In addition to Greer’s impossibly rapid head turns, there is little or no blurring of Greer’s head during these turns. Had his head turned as rapidly as indicated by the altered film, it should appear as a blob in the motion picture. This was proven by mathematics and substantiated on test films. 4) There is further evidence of removal of frames between 302 and 303. Stationary figures in the background in 302 are severely blurred but are not blurred in 303—only one frame later—while in both frames 302 and 303 the limousine is in sharp focus. The explanation is that Zapruder was panning his camera in 302 to keep up with the limousine speed, thus resulting in blur in the stationary background figures. When the blur disappears in the background figures between 302 and 303, it is stark evidence that the limousine is standing still in 303. Yet the film shows the limousine moving forward at a uniform speed of 11 miles per hour. This analysis was confirmed by renowned film expert Dr. Roderick Ryan. 5) Direct eyewitness testimony, under oath, of at least five witnesses confirms that the limousine had come almost to a stop during the fatal head shot sequence. And, as just explained, stopping of the limousine is confirmed between frames 302 and 303, indicating that a block of frames must have been removed between these two frames. Experience tells us that the limousine could not have decelerated from 11 miles per hour to a complete stop in 1/18 second; also, simply viewing the motion picture film, in motion, shows the limousine moving uniformly through the scene, as do measured calculations of forward motion of the limousine on a frame-by-frame basis. 6) Why were blocks of frames removed? The answer is provided by eyewitness testimonies and other photographs, as follows: The Zapruder film was altered to eliminate evidence of a fatal head shot, fired from the front—an eruption of material from the back of Kennedy’s head that should have appeared in the film. Numerous eyewitnesses testify that at the time of the fatal head shot there was an eruption of material backwards from Kennedy’s head. Also, motorcycle policeman Bobby Hargis testified that he was riding to the rear and left of the presidential limousine and, when Kennedy’s head was hit, it exploded and he was splattered with blood and brain. This is evidence of a shot from the front. But the Zapruder film does not show the eruption of blood from the rear of Kennedy’s head. It shows only an eruption of blood from the front of the head. Only by removal of frames by the plotters would the eruption from the rear of the head be absent from the film. 7) We not only have evidence of the forgery of the film by technical analysis, we also have eyewitness testimonies of what should have appeared on the film that did not appear, namely eruption of material from the back of Kennedy’s head. 8) An analysis of the chain of possession of the film shows that in all probability it was in the FBI’s possession when it was altered, while at the same time the Nix film was altered. There is a slight possibility that the Zapruder film could have been altered overnight in Dallas by other conspirators, but even in that unlikely event the altered film would have had to have been substituted for the copy that was sent by special plane and arrived in FBI headquarters early on Saturday morning. Therefore the FBI would have had knowledge of the altered film. There is no scenario that"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"does not implicate the FBI in the film alteration. 9) The evidence in this and the preceding two chapters conclusively shows that the Zapruder film is a forgery and that any conclusions reached from analysis of the film regarding timing of shots and backward motion of Kennedy at the point of the fatal shot must be viewed with deep skepticism . At the very least, any time segments calculated using the Zapruder film should be considered to be minimal times. Thus, it would have been possible for a single gunman from the School Book Depository to have fired three fatal shots within the time sequence of the shots of the assassination. This does not preclude, however, a second gunman from the front. In fact, alteration of the Zapruder film demonstrates the extreme need of the conspirators to conceal the fact of a shot from the front. 10) The question remains as to the ultimate motive for the alteration of the Zapruder film. Was it done by conspirators to conceal their involvement in the Kennedy assassination? Or was it directed by government officials to bury the fact that a conspiracy had taken place to assassinate John Kennedy by forces unknown (or forces known, and not to be disclosed to the American people)? We will now go to the amazing evidence of deception in the autopsy of the president’s body at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Washington, D.C., at the very heart of government. *** Epilogue At a JFK conference in Dallas in November 1996, I found that in 1992, Roy L. Schaeffer of Dayton, Ohio, had discovered the rapid head turn between frames 316 and 317. Moreover, he had estimated the angle of turn of Greer’s head to be 110 degrees between these two frames. This compares to the 115- degree angle that Marler, Mantik, and I had independently estimated! Schaeffer never published his finding, but had copyrighted an article about it. Schaeffer did not conduct tests as to how rapidly athletes or others could turn their heads. It was very intellectually satisfying to me that this totally independent discovery with confirming measurements had been made."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Tullius Photographs Vice President Lyndon Johnson’s car .

The sound of the first shot was indicated to be at approximately this point (between frames 186 and 202) by the Betzner photo and Willis photo (see Exhibit 10-1), one taken before and one after the first shot. At this point, Kennedy is blocked from the alleged sniper’s nest by tree foliage. Taking into account possible human misperceptions and delayed cognition of sound and sight, a consensus has formed among many researchers that a first shot (or shots) or a diversionary explosion occurred somewhere between frames 160 and 188. Because there are delays in human response to sounds, it seems plausible to assume the first explosive sound occurred nearer to frame 160 than 188. Gerald Posner says the first shot was fired before frame 166. He may be right on this point (Posner, p. 322). Michael West, D.D.S., says the first shot was probably fired at frame 152. He may also be right (Midwest Symposium, 1993). In any event, virtually all researchers agree that the first shot or explosive sound occurred well before Kennedy passed behind the freeway sign, and that if it was a gunshot, it missed. There is a general agreement by most researchers and also the House Select Committee on Assassinations that Kennedy was hit within a few frames after this one, just before he passed behind the Stemmons Freeway sign. The Warren Commission concluded that Kennedy was hit after he passed behind the freeway sign. For my purposes here, I will go along with the Warren Commission conclusion. This means that Kennedy was first hit somewhere between frames 206 and 210. "},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Zapruder Frame 223 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Governor Connally is now looking clearly and abruptly to his right, perhaps in response to the shot that hit Kennedy. Mrs. Kennedy is still looking at the president. The right lapel of Connally’s suit exposes his white shirt. Kennedy is about to emerge from behind the freeway sign. Zapruder Frame 224 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Kennedy emerges from behind the freeway sign. Both his right hand and left hand are starting to reach for his throat. Note that the right hand is already at throat level and is above the left hand. He has clearly been hit before this frame. Note that Connally’s right lapel appears to puff up or flip out in frame 224. But also note that at frame 223 the “puff” was not there. In spite of this, Gerald Posner cites the opinion of Dr. Michael West that this is evidence of a bullet having passed through Kennedy’s neck and pierced Connally’s chest, exiting through his lapel at frame 224. This argument is not consistent with the fact that Kennedy had already been hit by frame 224, otherwise he would not be seen reacting in frame 224. There is always a slight delay in manifest physiological response in one part of the body after getting hit by a bullet in another part of the body. This is only common sense. The fastest human reflex known to science is 40 milliseconds—one blink of the eye. Yet Posner would have us believe that within a blink of an eye Kennedy was hit by a bullet and his right arm had raised to clutch his throat. An eyelid is of miniscule weight compared to the weight of a hand and an arm; the reaction of the much heavier mass of a hand and arm is much slower. For Kennedy to have been hit in frame 224 and already reacted by raising his arms in 224 would require that both the hit and the raising of the arms take place and be recorded on the film in the 50 milliseconds’ exposure time of one frame. [64] "},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Zapruder Frame 225 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Kennedy’s right arm is up and he is reaching for his throat. His left hand and arm are also reaching up but are at a lower position than his right. The arms and hands are at approximately the same position as in the preceding frame 224. In frame 225 Kennedy’s right shirt cuff and shirt sleeve are now visible, making more clear the position of his hand and arm. In frame 224 one could see only a portion of his right shirt cuff and his right hand. Thus, by comparing frame 225 to 224, it is very clear that Kennedy’s right hand and arm are up in a horizontal position reaching for his throat. It is also clear that the left hand, seen directly below the right hand, is reaching upward. As in frame 224, John Connally is now turning to his right, as he testified to the Warren Commission. Mrs. Connally is looking straight ahead. She was not looking to the rear at this frame or in frame 224. Look at frame 228 for confirmation of this; Mrs. Connally is clearly looking straight ahead after frame 224. The importance of the position of Mrs. Connally’s head in terms of her testimony to the Warren Commission will be apparent in subsequent frames. Connally is turning back to his left, after hearing a shot, but he is not aware that Kennedy has been hit. Zapruder Frame 228 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Connally now looks straight ahead, obviously not yet hit by a bullet that, when it did hit later, shattered his rib and fractured his right wrist bone. Kennedy’s reaction to having been hit continues. Mrs. Connally continues to look straight ahead after frame 224, where Gerald Posner claims Connally was hit and Mrs. Connally was looking at him and Kennedy. Gerald Posner’s theory of Kennedy and Connally being hit simultaneously at frame 224 is now demolished. "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Zapruder Frame 232 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Connally looks straight ahead, seemingly unaware that anything has happened. His white Stetson hat is in his right hand. His right hand is held up to shoulder height holding the brim of his hat. The Warren Commission, the HSCA, Gerald Posner, et al., would have us believe that eight frames before this point Connally has been struck by a bullet that had already passed through his chest, shattered a rib, inflicted multiple fractures in his right wrist bone, and severed tendons controlling his right hand. This frame alone demolishes the single gunman theory. Kennedy’s elbows are now in their maximum position. Posner claims that they remain “locked” in “Thorburn’s Position” until the fatal hit at frame 312/313, which released the “locked” position. [65] Posner’s Thorburn hypothesis is demolished when we look at succeeding frames in which Kennedy’s arms have lowered well below the maximum position (as much as 45° lower). Well before the fatal hit at frame 312-313. A simple examination of frame 264 shows Posner’s argument to be ludicrous. Kennedy’s arms are not locked in position, as would be required for him to be in the Thorburn Position. The insurmountable problem of the Warren Commission and its apologists is that they can’t explain how Connally could be so serene as he appears in frame 232 when Kennedy has reacted so violently to having been hit, showing reaction when he emerged from behind the freeway sign at frame 224. In other words, they are faced with the embarrassing argument that Kennedy reacted instantaneously and Connally had a slow reaction. Thus we have the fallacious argument of the Thorburn Position which states that Kennedy is reacting to a bullet passing through or near his sixth cervical vertebra, causing him to reflex “instantaneously” into the position shown above. Zapruder Frame 233 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Mrs. Connally has just begun to turn to her right so that her angle of vision encompasses both Kennedy and Connally. This is the first time she has turned to look back, as she testified to the Warren Commission. It was probably at this frame, or in the preceding frame, that she saw that Kennedy had been hit. Read the discussion and her testimony in the following frame. "},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Zapruder Frame 234 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Connally’s right shoulder is driven further downward. “Recoiled to the right”—as Mrs. Connally testified.

Zapruder Frame 235 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Connally looks straight ahead, seemingly unperturbed. This is the frame that Connally believes he was hit. His Stetson hat is possibly still in his hand, but that is not clear. His right hand becomes a blur, possibly indicating that it has been hit. His right shoulder begins to drop, indicating that he has been hit in the back of the shoulder. (The larger mass of the upper body would accelerate slower than the much lower mass of the right hand, thus explaining the blur of the right hand in contrast to the relatively good focus of his right shoulder.) Mrs. Connally has turned so that her angle of vision encompasses Kennedy and Connally. (The view of Mrs. Connally’s head is partially obscured by Roy Kellerman’s head.) She sees that Kennedy has been hit but is not yet aware that her husband has been hit. She testified to the Warren Commission: Mr. Specter: And you are indicating with your own hands, two hands crossing over gripping your own neck? Mrs. Connally : Yes; and it seemed to me there was—he made no utterance, no cry. I saw no blood, no anything. It was just sort of nothing, the expression on his face, and he just sort of slumped down. Then very soon there was the second shot that hit John. As the first shot was hit, and I turned to look at the same time, I recall John saying, “Oh, no, no, no.” Then there was a second shot, and it hit John, and as he recoiled to the right, just crumpled like a wounded animal to the right, he said, “My God, they are going to kill us all.” (There is a delay of 1.3 frames in the travel of sound relative to the travel of the bullet over the 177-foot distance from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building: the bullet travels at 2000 feet per second and sound travels in air at 1000 feet per second—thus the bullet takes 1.58 frames to travel the distance whereas the sound takes 2.9 frames. Because of this, Mrs. Connally would not have heard the sound of the shot until about one to two frames after frame 234. She also would not have seen the motion of John Connally’s shoulder until one to two frames later, even though he had already been hit, due to the large mass of his shoulder accelerating slowly. Mrs. Connally probably saw the hit at frame 235 or 236 and at the same time heard the sound.) See frame 238 for further discussion on this. Some researchers believe that Connally was hit twice: first in the hand (in this frame) and second in the right shoulder in"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"frames 290 to as late as frame 328. For my purpose here I will not address that possibility. My purpose is to determine when Connally was first hit as compared when Kennedy was first hit. Zapruder Frame 238 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Connally’s right shoulder is driven sharply down to his right. Note that the red flowers next to Mrs. Kennedy have suddenly become fore visible. Mrs. Connally is now aware that her husband has been hit. Mrs. Connally is looking to her right; both Kennedy and Connally are within her angle of vision. Repeating her Warren Commission testimony, she told Life magazine in 1966: “As far as the first two shots go, my memory is divided into four distinct events. First I heard the shot, or a strange loud noise—I’m not that expert on rifles—back behind us. Then next I turned to my right and saw the President gripping at his throat. Then I turned back toward John (Connally), and I heard the second shot that hit John (Connally)... I must have been looking right at him when it hit because I saw him recoil to the right ... so you see I had time to look at the President after he was already hit, then turn and see John hit by a second shot. Then, of course, he slumped, and I reached to pull him toward me.” Zapruder Frame 242 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company In the opinion of almost all researchers (and then only by ignoring the subtle evidence in preceding frames), this is the latest point that Connally could have been hit (if he were hit only once). In its November 25, 1966 issue, Life magazine wrote of this frame: Connally is caving in. His right shoulder has slumped dramatically. The change can be seen best by noting the red patch behind him which was identified as a bunch of red roses lying on the seat next to Mrs. Kennedy. In 236 the roses are only barely visible behind Connally’s right shoulder. In 242 much more of the roses can be seen, showing that Connally’s shoulder has been jerked downward and perhaps also forward by the impact of the bullet. His head has snapped around to the right and his mouth seems to be framing a cry, perhaps the exclamation that his wife heard him utter soon after he was hit: “My God! They are going to kill us all!” If we agree with the Warren Commission and assume the earliest that Kennedy could have been hit was frame 210 (just after he passed behind the freeway sign), and if we assume for the moment that no frames have been deleted from the film by the conspirators, then a maximum of 32 frames elapsed between Kennedy’s first hit and the very latest that Connally could have been hit at 242. This amounts to a maximum elapsed time of 1.79 seconds. Therefore, inasmuch as the alleged assassin’s rifle took a minimum of 2.3 seconds to fire and reload with the bolt-action rifle, there must have been a second gunman."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" However, if it should be proven that frames have been deleted by the conspirators between frames 210 and 242, then the time between Kennedy’s hit and Connally’s becomes greater and it could allow sufficient time for a rifleman to have gotten off successive shots. But now we would have even more damning evidence of a conspiracy—the forging of the Zapruder film that was presumably in the control of the Secret Service or the FBI. Moreover, if frames were removed in this segment, the hypothesis that Connally and Kennedy were hit by the same bullet becomes even more ludicrous. Zapruder Frame 264 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Connally is still in a position to be looking at Kennedy. Kellerman has now turned 45° to his left, perhaps saying something to Greer (the driver). Not once until now has Kellerman looked back. How incredible for a top Secret Service agent! At least four seconds have elapsed since the sound of the first shot (assuming no frames are missing). Mrs. Connally is still looking at Kennedy and Connally. In the succeeding frames she pulls him over into her arms. She testified: “I put my head down over his head...all I could see were people flashing by. I didn’t look back anymore.” (Emphasis added) (See frame 312, just before the fatal head shot, for Mrs. Connally’s head position.) Mrs. Connally’s testimony and these photos contradict the contention that Connally was hit in frame 224, because she looked back only once , starting at frame 234. It was at this point that she saw Kennedy clutching at his throat, after which she said she saw her husband struck. Kennedy’s arms are now lowered well below their maximum position in frame 232. They have not been locked in the “Thorburn Position” as claimed by Posner. (Refer to frame 232 for discussion.) Kellerman now looks over his left shoulder for the first time. His number-one rule by Secret Service oath is to use his body to shield the president, yet only now he looks back, with no indication whatsoever to make any physical move to protect the president or the governor. Zapruder Frame 282 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Kellerman is now clearly looking back at Kennedy. Kellerman was interviewed by FBI agents Sibert and O’Neill on November 27, 1963 at the White House. In the interview Kellerman told the FBI that when the shots rang out he turned toward the rear and “ observed President Kennedy with his left hand in back of him appearing to be reaching to a point on his right shoulder. At the time he made this statement he apparently did not have access to the Zapruder film, which clearly shows that when Kennedy was"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"first wounded he raised both hands sharply toward his throat and in no way did he reach up and extend his left hand behind his back reaching to a point on his right shoulder. If Kellerman was telling the truth, it lends evidence that the Zapruder film was altered by removal of frames which could have shown Kennedy with his left hand in back of him. Zapruder Frame 302 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Greer looking almost straight ahead. Note the blur of the legs of the two women standing on the left and the woman in the background. This indicates that Zapruder is panning his camera to match the speed of the limo because the picture of the limo is in relatively sharp focus. Zapruder Frame 303 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Greer suddenly looks back. This is a turn of about 105° in one frame, or 0.0546 second, a rotational speed of 1,923 degrees per second. This is equivalent to 5.3 complete revolutions per second. The fastest known human response is the blink of an eye which is equivalent to only one frame on Zapruder’s camera. The 105° head turn of Greer in one frame indicates that frames are missing between frames 302 and 303. See frames 315, 316, and 317 for discussion. Tests using young, top athletes as subjects could not find rotational speeds in turns of even 50% of the speed that Greer exhibits here. Greer was 54 years old in 1963. Further proof of missing frames between 302 and 303 is the lack of blur of Greer’s head. The head should be a complete blur at a rotational speed 1,923 degrees per second. Comparing frame 303 to 302, note that the blur of the legs of the two women on the left and the woman in the background has now disappeared, yet the limousine in frame 303 is still in the same good focus. This has occurred in one frame. This indicates that the limousine is standing still or moving very slowly in 303 because the women in the background and the limousine are both in good focus. This cannot be explained by camera jiggle; if Zapruder had jiggled his camera, both the background figures and the limo would be out of focus. At 11 mph (the speed that the limo was supposed to be traveling) it would advance 10.9 inches in one frame. This corresponds roughly to the amount of blur in the legs of the women in 302, thus confirming that the limo is moving very slowly or standing still in 303. Numerous witnesses testified that the limo slowed down to almost a stop, or stopped completely, further confirming this conclusion: The limo is almost at a complete stop in 303 and a block of frames was removed between 302 and 303."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" We have quadruple-compounded proof of missing frames between 302 and 303: (1) leg blur in 302 not in 303; (2) calculations confirm amount of leg blur; (3) head turn between 302 and 303 not confirmable in tests of top athletes; (4) no blur of head in 303. [2009 Update: Dr. John Costella believes (correctly) that the blurs in Z303 can be explained as a combination of background figure motion, limo speed and camera tracking deviation from limo speed and, therefore, Dr. Ryan’s statement to me—that the limo was standing still—cannot be scientifically supported. I disagree with the wording of Dr. Costella here. Dr. Ryan, no longer living to defend himself, was simply giving me his opinion from the view of a senior, experienced motion picture technology expert—a little over simplified—but never intended to imply that the limo was exactly standing still, or that the background figures were not in some motion or camera jiggle. A careful scrutiny of blurs in Z303 and 304 show (maybe) tracking deviation in the background figures, and a slowing down, almost to a stop, of the limo. In any event, Dr. Costella is in agreement with me that Greer’s head turns are evidence of frame removal. Frame 303 is very likely a composite of a separate background with background figures, and a foreground that includes the limo. Inasmuch as the whole frame is a composite or composites, it is almost meaningless except when compared to other frames. I should point out that Dr. Costella prefaced his analysis of Frame 303 in the context of the frame standing alone, whereas Dr. Ryan’s answer to me was in the context of comparison of Frame 303 to Frame 302.] Zapruder Frame 304 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Greer continues to look back and will remain looking at Kennedy until after the fatal head shot at frame 313. Only at frame 315 does Greer start to turn forward. He clearly was looking at Kennedy during the fatal shot, yet he testified that he did not see the fatal shot. It is at about this point, or a few frames later, that Mary Ann Moorman snapped a photograph with her Polaroid camera. See Exhibit C-1. Zapruder Frame 312 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Greer looks back. Connally has apparently partially recovered; he is now more erect. Kennedy’s head seems to accelerate forward about one inch to two inches between frames 312 and 313. This is the frame where Josiah Thompson [66] says that Kennedy received a fatal head shot from the rear, to be followed almost simultaneously in frame 313 by a second shot to the right temple from the right front."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" Zapruder Frame 313 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Here we see an apparent explosion of bloody matter out of the right temple forward of Kennedy’s right ear. There are two red streaks that point upward. Most researchers consider this to be the fatal head shot; others consider it to be a forgery in which the eruption of blood was either matted or painted in. And one forensic blood spatter expert, Sherry Pool Gutierrez, considers it to be back spatter from a bullet entering the right temple. [67] The limousine is moving forward at an apparent speed of about 11 miles per hour, based on my calculations, with the assumption that none of the frames has been removed from the Zapruder film. Yet, the complete stopping or slowing of the limousine was observed by thirty-six witnesses; [68] of these, twenty-one said the limousine stopped completely. Note that the head of the driver, Secret Service agent Greer, is turned around about 150° looking at the president at the instant of impact. Why was Greer, a veteran agent and top choice as a driver, not speeding forward to escape the assassin’s fire? Worse yet, why had he stopped or slowed down? Not until frame 317 did Greer accelerate the car forward; this was fully 7.1 seconds after the sound of the first shot at frame 189. Even if we accept the Warren Commission’s hypotheses that the first shot could have occurred at frame 225, there still would have been 5.15 seconds’ delay in Greer’s reaction time. That is a long time for a highly trained agent. Zapruder Frame 314 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Kennedy’s head has now moved backward about one inch since the preceding frame. Kellerman is looking straight ahead. Greer is still looking back, observing the aftermath of the fatal head wound. The limousine has not yet sped up. A strange blob appears on the right side of Kennedy’s face, partially obscuring Mrs. Kennedy’s face. In the following 48 frames, this blob will inexplicably move around on the side of Kennedy’s face, changing size and shape. What is this? Where did it come from? There is no visible wound in the back or top or side of Kennedy’s head. The autopsy photos show Kennedy’s face intact. Witnesses confirm that the face was unharmed, yet this photo shows something appearing to be blood or matter originating from his right cheek. Subsequent frames will show this artifact more clearly."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" Zapruder Frame 315 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Here the mysterious blob on Kennedy’s face is not originating from the right side, rear, and top of the head, which would be necessary to be consistent with the autopsy photograph of the head wound taken when the president’s body was delivered to Bethesda Naval Hospital. The blob is now huge, almost as large as Kennedy’s head. It is a double blob, obscuring the right side of Mrs. Kennedy’s face. This mysterious blob has been considered by some researchers to be a flap of scalp that was blown out of the right top of Kennedy’s head and is hanging down over his cheek. However, if that were the case, there should be an equally large portion of Kennedy’s scalp missing in this photograph and subsequent photographs. It is obvious in examining subsequent photographs that this is not the case. For example, look at frame 317, which clearly shows that the top and side of Kennedy’s scalp is intact. In frame 335, it appears that the right top front of Kennedy’s scalp may be missing, but that is simply sunlight shining on Kennedy’s head at the particular angle in which it is positioned. The effect of sunlight on Kennedy’s head can be observed by studying various frames (such as frames 304 and 312, in which a distinct line between light and dark is present). Moreover, the blob is far too large to be a flap of scalp. It is possibly some other phenomenon, such as a crude attempt by the conspirators to insert false evidence using film special- effects techniques. Zapruder Frame 316 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Greer is still looking back at Kennedy; Greer has just begun to turn to the front. In his report submitted to the Warren Commission, Greer failed to say that he witnessed the fatal head wound: “The President’s automobile was almost past this building and I was looking at the overpass that we were about to pass under in case someone was on top of it, when I heard what I thought was the backfire of a motorcycle behind the President’s automobile. After the second shot, I glanced over my right shoulder and saw Governor Connally start to fall. I knew then that something was wrong and I immediately pushed the accelerator to the floor and Mr. Kellerman said, get out of here.” (W.C. Vol. XVIII, p. 723) In his later testimony, Greer emphasized not seeing the fatal head shot: Mr. Specter: And describe or indicate how far you turned your head to the right at that time?"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Mr. Greer : Just so that my eyes over, caught the Governor, I could see, I couldn’t see the President . I just could see the Governor. I made a quick glance and back again. Mr . Specter: Were you able to see anything of President Kennedy as you glanced to the rear? Mr . Greer: No sir; I didn’t see anything of the President. I didn’t look, I wasn’t far enough around to see the President. W .C. Vol. II, pp. 118-119 (Emphasis added) Greer is obviously not describing what really happened. Is he lying? If so, why? Zapruder Frame 317 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Greer now turns to look forward. He has made a 115° turn in one frame—0.0546 second—from the preceding frame. This is an extremely rapid movement considering that the blinking of an eye (the fastest known human physiological reflex response) takes about .06 second. See Exhibits C-2, C-3, and C-4 for time-motion test results using top athletes as subjects. This rapid turn of Greer’s head and body is explained by frames having been removed. One reason the conspirators might have wanted to speed up the film was to minimize the evidence of the delay in Greer’s reaction in accelerating the limousine. Bystanders have testified that the limousine had come almost to a complete stop at the time of the fatal head wound. Another reason would be to delete incriminating evidence (of blow-out of Kennedy’s skull to the rear) on the frames that were removed. Greer’s rapid turn has only two conceivable explanations: (2) although extremely unlikely, the camera somehow skipped some frames; or (2) there was in fact alteration of the Zapruder film by the conspirators. This is discussed in depth in Chapters 11 and 12. Time-motion tests using a step-frame video camera and an 8mm motion picture camera show that the rotational speed of Greer’s turn is more than double that possible by athletes who were tested. The rotational speed in Greer’s turn here is 2106 degrees per second, equivalent to 5.85 complete revolutions per second, an obvious impossibility. None of the athletes tested could equal 50% of Greer’s speed, even when cued to snap their head and shoulders as rapidly as possible. Also, note that Greer’s head is in relatively sharp focus. It should be a complete blur at this speed. Missing frames between 316 and 317 diminish arguments about the rapid backward acceleration of Kennedy’s head and upper body when he was presumably struck in the right front of the head by a bullet from the grassy knoll; Kennedy’s backward movement could have been much slower than the altered Zapruder film shows. "},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Zapruder Frame 321 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company Kennedy’s head and body are now back against the rear of the seat; a backward head movement of about eight inches has taken place in about one-half second. Most researchers have concluded that this rapid acceleration backward is evidence of a shot striking Kennedy’s head from the front, and proof of a second gunman, but the new evidence of frame removal makes the point moot. Connally is now starting to collapse. Some researchers believe that he was hit slightly before or after this frame, possibly for the second time. Zapruder Frame 335 Copyright 1967 (renewed 1995) LMH Company (color enhanced by author) Jacqueline Kennedy, with her mouth open in horror, attempts to put back in place a piece of skull in the wound to the rear of the president’s head. Look closely and you will see her white gloved hand behind a flap of scalp and hair. When she arrived at Parkland Hospital, she had a portion of Kennedy’s brain clutched in her hand (HSCA Vol. VII, p. 287). In her testimony to the Warren Commission, Mrs. Kennedy said that she was looking to the left and heard “those terrible noises. You know.” She said, “And my husband never made any sound. So I turned to the right. And all I remember is seeing my husband, he had this sort of quizzical look on his face, and his hand was up, it must have been his left hand. And I just turned and looked at him, I could see a piece of his skull and I remembered it was flesh colored. I remember thinking he just looked as if he had a slight headache. And I just remember seeing that. No blood or anything. (Emphasis added.) Later in her testimony, Mrs. Kennedy described the location of the head wound but it was deleted from the published report (W.C. Vol. V, p. 180). But in 1992 the National Archives declassified that portion of her testimony: What she had said was, “I was trying to hold his hair on. But from the front there was nothing. I suppose there must have been. But from the back you could see, you know, you were trying to hold his hair on, and his skull on.” This is dramatic, tangible evidence of an exit wound in the rear of the head , corroborated in vivid detail in the above photo. Dr. McClelland’s description of the rear head wound observed at Parkland Hospital and about 30 other witnesses’ descriptions and testimonies are in agreement with Mrs. Kennedy’s testimony and this photo. Even more corroboration is provided by Secret Service agent Clinton Hill, who ran to the limousine immediately after the fatal wound. In his testimony to the Warren Commission, Hill stated: “As I lay over the top of the back seat I noticed a portion of the President’s head on the right rear side was missing and he was bleeding profusely. Part of his brain was gone. I saw a part of his skull with hair on it lying in the seat.” (Emphasis added) Four separate items of evidence converge: (1) Mrs. Kennedy’s eyewitness testimony, (2) Clinton Hill’s eyewitness testimony, (3) Dr. McClelland’s and Parkland Hospital personnel’s eyewitness testimony, and (4) an actual photograph of the flap of scalp with Mrs. Kennedy attempting to put a piece of skull back in place in the back of the head.

Mary Ann Moorman’s famous Polaroid photograph is considered by researchers to correspond to about Zapruder frame 314, just after or at the time of the fatal head shot. This photo was taken on the opposite side of Elm Street from where Zapruder stood. He can be seen standing on the concrete abutment in the upper right-hand corner of the photograph. Note on line A-B that John Connally is in a position on almost a direct line between his wife Nellie (A) and Mrs. Kennedy (B). He is leaning backward against the left-hand side of the limousine, and appears to be completely out of the jump seat. The remarkable thing about this photo is that at no frame in the Zapruder film is Connally in this position! This is strong evidence that a block of frames was removed from the Zapruder film at or near the time of the fatal head shot. The reason it is apparent that a block of frames has been removed is that it would have taken several frames for Connally to have moved from his position in the right-hand jump seat to where he is shown in the above photograph. If frames were removed here, then of course this would not be frame 314. This photograph has received close scrutiny by numerous researchers, but primarily because it shows the grassy knoll and the picket fence at the instant of the fatal head shot. There are two or three places behind the picket fence or concrete walls where researchers believe there are people, i.e., a gunman behind the fence. This might be true, but my focus here is on Connally’s position in the limousine.

The test for Dawson was made using a Sony model CCD F-40 video camera, which has the feature of step-frame playback at 30 frames per second. The shutter speed while taking the video was 1/100 second. The test for Marler was made with an 8mm movie camera at 18 frames per second. These tests show that neither of the athletes was able to achieve any more than 50% of the speed that Greer turned his head starting at Zapruder frame 315. The subjects, athletes in excellent condition, were seated and were asked to look backward at angle X. This simulated Greer’s head position at Zapruder frame 315/316 (20°). The subjects were instructed to turn their heads and shoulders as rapidly as they possibly could to look straight ahead upon an audible signal. The video and films were played back and visual estimates made of head position at each frame in the playback. The test was repeated many times. The above results are typical.

Caro, The Path to Power 13 THE AUTOPSY "},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" Of all the evidence, the United States government’s involvement in a cover-up in the autopsy of John F. Kennedy is the most torturing and complex. It is loaded with contradictory testimonies, recanted statements, some evidence that is accurate, some that is obfuscated, and some that has been altered; but it is very important. To have any hope of dealing with this evidence one must realize that if the vice president, the director of the FBI, and the Secret Service were involved in the conspiracy, and if the CIA and military intelligence cooperated in a cover-up, virtually anything is possible. Keep in mind that this cabal would have been in a position to manipulate or control everything ; and by the time of the autopsy, things had gone terribly, desperately wrong in their plot. I can well imagine that nothing would be too extreme in their actions to conceal the momentous crime they had just committed. As I contemplate the words that will follow I feel that I will reach the point where every reader will be seized with utter disbelief. But our business is to proceed. In brief, the thrust of these allegations is that the conspirators literally stole the body of President Kennedy from Air Force One, took it to a secret location where they enlarged the bullet exit wound in the lower rear of the skull to make the wound extend to the top and right side of skull, and crudely excised a major portion of the brain to remove incriminating bullet fragments. By performing these operations, they obscured the direction from which the fatal head shot occurred. They then delivered the body to the morgue at the rear of Bethesda Naval Hospital. While all of this was being done, they deceived the public and virtually everyone in government to conceal the momentous crime that had been committed. For purposes of analysis, I was obliged to simplify the evidence—sort out the best evidence without being dishonestly selective. I found it useful to divide this macabre scene into five basic elements, which I called allegations: [69] Allegation 1: The president’s body was put aboard Air Force One in Dallas in a bronze ceremonial casket; the body was wrapped in a sheet. But when the body arrived at the morgue of Bethesda Naval Hospital it was in a plain shipping casket and it was in a zippered, military-style body bag. It arrived at the morgue before the Kennedy party arrived at the front of the hospital in a Navy ambulance which was transporting the ceremonial bronze casket that had left Dallas. This is the basic starting point in developing the evidence; it would prove that the body had been removed from the casket in which it left Parkland Hospital in Dallas. Allegation 2: When the president’s body left Dallas there was a wound in the back of the head that measured approximately three inches in diameter. When the body arrived at Bethesda Naval Hospital, this wound had been expanded to a large gaping hole measuring approximately seven inches by five inches. The wound observed in Dallas was mainly in the right lower rear (occipital) region of Kennedy’s head. The wound observed in Bethesda extended from the top of the head near the hairline down to the back of the head, mainly on the right hemisphere, to a point approximately one to two inches above the hairline of the neck. Surgery had been performed on the head, in secrecy, which enlarged the wound. Allegation 3: When the president’s body was first received at Bethesda in the body bag and shipping casket, the brain was almost completely missing. When the body left Dallas, about two thirds of the brain was intact. Allegation 4: A wound in the front of the president’s neck was surreptitiously enlarged after the body left Dallas,"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"and before it was delivered to the Bethesda morgue, to make it appear to be an exit wound when in fact it was an entrance wound. Allegation 5: The autopsy report prepared by the Navy autopsy pathologist at Bethesda was changed, after the autopsy was conducted and after the body was taken to the White House, under pressure from officials in the White House to conceal evidence of more than one gunman. It will be argued here that proof of all of these allegations is not necessary to establish the complicity of employees and officials of the government in the cover-up of the assassination of President Kennedy, if not in the assassination itself. That is, only proof of two or three of the allegations, in combination, will be required to prove guilt. This is similar to prosecuting attorneys’ methods, in which they do not place themselves in the position of having to prove all of their allegations to get a conviction, the reason being that if all allegations had to be proven there would be precious few criminal convictions. What we must deal with here is an incredibly complex problem of uncovering a shell game, carried out by agents of the federal government, in which their objective was to deceive the American public into believing that there was only one gunman who killed the president. To achieve this deception, it was necessary that they conceal the fact that there was an exit wound in the back of the president’s head (therefore evidence of a shot from the front), in which case a conspiracy would have been revealed of such magnitude that it would not have been possible to cover it up. I found it useful to prepare a chronological time graph, drawn to scale, of the major events. The advantage of plotting events to a linear scale is that it shows large time gaps and bunching of events. These timelines are shown in Exhibits 13-1, 13-2, and 13-3. (All exhibits for this chapter are at the end of the chapter) Sequence of Times of Major Events Following is a brief discussion of most of the items on the timelines. Kennedy was shot at 12:30 p.m. His body arrived at Parkland Memorial Hospital at 12:38 p.m. He was pronounced dead at 1:00 p.m. after having received a tracheotomy (a small incision in the neck to insert a breathing device) and after having cardiac massage. At 2:04 p.m. Kennedy’s body left Parkland Hospital in a bronze-colored ceremonial casket. The body was placed on a plastic sheet in the casket and wrapped in sheets. This fact has been affirmed many times on national television and in taped interviews of Aubrey Rike , who was an ambulance attendant at Dallas at the time; and his statement has been confirmed by his assistant at the time, Dennis McGuire. Also, the fact of the body being wrapped in sheets was confirmed by Dr. Charles Crenshaw, one of the doctors attending the body at Parkland Hospital, who was present when the casket lid was closed. [70] When Kennedy’s body was in Dallas, a wound about three inches in diameter in the lower back of the head was observed; the remainder of his head and face appeared to be intact. [71] This was attested to by over twenty-five witnesses including all of the doctors, nurses, and hospital technicians. The doctors testified under oath before the Warren Commission. No autopsy was performed in Dallas. The body was taken from Texas to Washington, D.C., over the objections of the Texas authorities, presumably because it violated Texas law. An issue still in question"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"is whether the original plan of the conspirators was to have the autopsy performed in Dallas or in a military hospital in Washington, D.C. But because of the demands of Jacqueline Kennedy and Kennedy’s top aides, and/or because the plot had gone awry, the body was seized after a prolonged argument with Dallas authorities. This argument has been reported in many articles and books. The casket was literally forced from the hands of the Dallas authorities and wheeled to a hearse, then driven to Love Field with Jacqueline Kennedy, where the casket was put aboard Air Force One. The bronze casket was placed on board Air Force One at 2:18 p.m. The plane was kept on the ground until 2:47 p.m. It was between 2:15 p.m. and 2:38 p.m. that the president’s body could have been taken from its casket. [72] At 2:38 p.m., Lyndon Johnson was sworn in as the next president. It was Johnson’s desire that he be sworn in before leaving Dallas. Legally, he could have waited until he got back to Washington, D.C. He was already president, by law, and the swearing-in ceremony was not necessary. At 2:47 p.m., Air Force One departed from Love Field at Dallas. The presidential plane arrived at Andrews Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., at 6:00 p.m. At 6:10 p.m., Jacqueline Kennedy and Robert Kennedy departed from Andrews Air Force Base in a gray Navy ambulance and accompanied the bronze casket to Bethesda Naval Hospital. Strangely, at approximately 6:40 to 6:45 p.m., a black hearse (not the gray Navy ambulance) arrived at the rear of Bethesda Naval Hospital at the morgue dock. In the hearse was a plain gray casket. The casket has been called a “shipping casket,” common to types used to ship bodies around the country. The shipping casket was received by First Class Petty Officer Dennis David, [73] who was chief of the day of the hospital at that time. The shipping casket was immediately taken into the morgue. Dennis David has stated that the casket was quite heavy. Paul O’Connor, who was a Navy hospital corpsman on the autopsy team at the time, told me in 1993 during a three-day interview that the casket was brought into the morgue within 30 to 40 seconds after it arrived and that Dennis David had confirmed that fact to him. The shipping casket was immediately opened and in it was the president’s body in a military-style, zippered body bag. The body was removed by first opening a zipper the full length on the front of the body bag. Startlingly, as testified by O’Connor and confirmed by Navy x-ray technician Jerrol Custer [74] (who was present), there was little or no brain inside Kennedy’s head. The body was nude and the head was wrapped in a bloody sheet. O’Connor said there was a huge, gaping hole, seven inches by four inches, in the back and top of the head; and the brain was almost completely gone except for a few fragments. It should be noted that no surgery had been performed on Kennedy’s head at Parkland Hospital in Dallas; and that when the body left Dallas it was in a bronze ceremonial casket, the head was wrapped in a towel, and the body was wrapped in a sheet, not a body bag. Also, when the body left Dallas, approximately two thirds of the brain was still intact, and there was a hole only in the back of the head which was about three inches in diameter. At 6:55 p.m. the Kennedy party, in the gray Navy ambulance, arrived in front of Bethesda Naval Hospital. Military officers conferred at the door of the ambulance for a few minutes. Also, just before 7:05 p.m., Dennis David (who had just seen Kennedy’s body delivered to the rear of the hospital about twenty minutes before) walked to the front of the hospital and was standing in an office on the second floor. He was looking out the window when he saw the Kennedy motorcade with a Navy ambulance arrive and Jacqueline and Robert Kennedy get out and go through the front door. The truthfulness of Dennis David’s statement is greatly enhanced by the fact that he did not have to remember actual times. David had to recall only the sequence of first seeing the black hearse arrive with the gray shipping casket with Kennedy’s body in it and then walking to the front of the hospital, looking out the window, and seeing the Kennedy motorcade arrive. There is no doubt by anyone that the bronze casket was in the Navy ambulance when it arrived at the"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"front of the hospital at 6:55 p.m. Now if we accept the statements of Paul O’Connor and Dennis David, the bronze casket must have been empty—and if we accept Aubrey Rike’s and Dennis McGuire’s statements that the body was in the bronze casket when it was loaded onboard Air Force One , and when Air Force One arrived at Andrews Air Force Base the bronze casket was immediately loaded on the Navy ambulance, which then proceeded directly to the front of Bethesda Naval Hospital (on that all are agreed)—it then follows that the body must have been removed from the bronze casket somewhere between the time it was loaded on Air Force One in Dallas and when it was unloaded to the Navy ambulance at Andrews. At about 7:05 p.m., when Jacqueline Kennedy was entering the hospital through the front lobby, she was passed in the lobby by Navy x-ray technician Jerrol Custer, who was carrying exposed x-ray film of JFK’s body that had already been taken. This despite the fact that JFK’s body was supposedly outside in a bronze casket in the Navy ambulance. We now have a corroboration of Dennis David’s story. At this point we have converging, mutually corroborative evidence from three extremely credible witnesses: Jerrol Custer had already exposed x-ray films of JFK’s body when he passed Jacqueline Kennedy coming through the lobby at the front of the hospital. Paul O’Connor confirms Custer’s statements. Dennis David had already unloaded the body in a shipping casket and delivered it into the morgue and had walked to the front of the hospital when he, too, saw Jacqueline Kennedy get out of the Navy ambulance and go through the front door. This confirms Jerrol Custer statements. And Paul O’Connor’s statements confirm Dennis David’s. This evidence cannot be over-emphasized. It reveals that Kennedy’s body had been taken from Air Force One, when it was under the exclusive control of the Secret Service, and, by extension, under the control of Lyndon Johnson. At approximately 7:05 p.m., after the Kennedy party had left the ambulance and entered the front of the hospital, the Navy ambulance drove off with the bronze casket in it. Then a strange incident occurred: There was a “chase” of the ambulance by a casket team in a pick-up truck who had been waiting to carry the bronze casket into the morgue. They followed the Navy ambulance thinking that it was going to drive to the rear of the morgue where they would perform the ceremony of carrying in the casket. But they lost the ambulance. They had two fruitless trips to the rear of the hospital and finally returned to the front of the hospital. Finally, at 7:50 p.m., the Navy ambulance with the bronze casket in it was reunited with the casket team at the front of the hospital. [75] Another strange incident now occurred. At 8:00 p.m. the bronze casket was delivered to the morgue by the casket team. The bronze casket was opened in the morgue with official parties present including the head of the autopsy team, Dr. Humes, his assistant Dr. Boswell, Kennedy’s aide General McHugh, and a casket team member, James Felder. If it is presumed that Kennedy’s body was in the casket, we have a major conflict in the evidence. One witness, James Felder, told David Lifton that Kennedy’s body was in the bronze casket when it was opened in the morgue. But how could Kennedy’s body be in the bronze casket when it was already in the morgue and x-rays and photographs had already been taken? This implies that it was not the bronze casket or, if the body was in the bronze casket, it was not Kennedy’s body. (Remember, the head was wrapped in a sheet and a substitute body could have been mistaken for Kennedy; more on this later.) At approximately 8:15 p.m. the “first incision” was made, according to a report prepared by FBI agents James W. Sibert and Francis X. O’Neill, who were present at the autopsy. They also noted in their report that “surgery had been performed on the head” when the body arrived at Bethesda. (No surgery had been performed on the head at Parkland Hospital; therefore, logic dictates that the surgery must have occurred when the body was in transit.) At 10:30 p.m. the autopsy “formally begins” according to Dr. Ebersole. The body had been in the morgue since 6:45 p.m., almost four hours, with the autopsy team present all that time."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"At 12:00 midnight the chief pathologist, Dr. James Humes, a Navy commander, announced publicly the results of the autopsy: “Two shots from the rear.” This would become the official position of the United States government from then until this writing. Not once has the government budged from this position; neither have Dr. Humes nor his colleague at the autopsy, Dr. Boswell, changed their positions. At the time of his announcement to the public, Dr. Humes had not yet written his report (that would be done the next day, after which he burned his original notes—admitted by Humes himself in his report to the Warren Commission) nor had he or Dr. Boswell examined the photographs taken during the autopsy— and they had only examined the x-rays superficially on the viewing screen in the autopsy room. A supplemental autopsy report would later state that the brain weighed 1500 grams (an above-normal weight for a human brain), yet all witnesses who observed the brain both at Parkland Hospital and at Bethesda Naval Hospital, who would talk about it, said a large portion of the brain was gone as a result of the head wound. Between 11:30 p.m. and 3:00 a.m. the body was prepared for burial by personnel from Gawler’s Funeral Home who had been sent to the hospital. At 3:30 a.m., Secret Service agent Roy Kellerman took all of the autopsy and x-ray films and delivered them to Secret Service agent Robert Bouck at the White House. At 3:56 a.m. the body was taken to the White House, accompanied by the Kennedy party and Secret Service agent William Greer. The Secret Service maintained possession of the films in the White House for 17 months before turning them over to the control of Robert Kennedy, with other autopsy materials, on April 26, 1965. These materials included Kennedy’s brain in a stainless-steel container, and microscopic slides of tissues. This material would be retained in a footlocker by Evelyn Lincoln, who now had an office in the National Archives. Lincoln then turned over the footlocker to Robert Kennedy’s personal secretary. Thus it was in the control of Robert Kennedy until October 31, 1966, when it was opened at the National Archives, at which time it was discovered that the brain and the tissue slides were missing. It seems safe to assume that the container for the brain was never opened by the Kennedys. It might very well have been empty at the time it was given to them. The autopsy pathologists did not see the autopsy photographs until three years after the autopsy. No member of the Warren Commission (except for a cursory look by Earl Warren) ever saw any of the autopsy photographs and x-rays, yet they endorsed the autopsy report: “two shots from the rear.” It will now be helpful to review excerpts from a three-day interview I conducted with Paul O’Connor that cuts across all of the foregoing issues. O’Connor’s story was first revealed to the public in David Lifton’s Best Evidence . Lifton provided me with a transcript of his taped interview with O’Connor to compare with my interview. O’Connor’s first interview was conducted by the HSCA in 1978, but incredibly was buried in the National Archives until 1994. Neither O’Connor nor any of the enlisted personnel who were involved in the autopsy were called to testify before the Warren Commission, or even asked for written statements. They were all sworn to secrecy under threat of imprisonment in the federal penitentiary. Not until 1978, when released by Act of Congress, did they start talking. O’Connor was a Navy hospital corpsman at the time of the autopsy. He was one of the five full-time members of the autopsy team at Bethesda Hospital. The others were Navy Commander Dr. James J. Humes, who was chief pathologist for the autopsy; Dr. J. Thornton Boswell, who was in co-charge of the team; Army Colonel Pierre A. Finck, who was brought into the team as a consultant at the request of Dr. Humes; and Navy hospital corpsman James Curtis Jenkins, who worked with Paul O’Connor assisting the military doctors. "},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Interview with Paul Kelly O’Connor—First Segment In July 1992 I met with Paul Kelly O’Connor at the J.W. Marriott Hotel in Washington, D.C. During the next three days we talked about the Kennedy assassination and O’Connor’s incredible experience. This story is a drama that truly is stranger than fiction. All that is related here is consistent in detail and content with O’Connor’s previous testimony with the HSCA and in his other interviews. I am using my interview because it is far more extensive than the others. At the time of the autopsy O’Connor had been in the Navy four years and was twenty-two years old. Prior to serving at Bethesda Naval Hospital he had been at Guantanamo Naval Hospital during the Bay of Pigs invasion and had medically treated the Cuban freedom fighters when they climbed over the fence in panic as the invasion disintegrated. Also, O’Connor had later been part of a Marine task force assigned to invade Cuba during the Cuban missile crisis. His contingent was just off the coast of Cuba ready to land when the crisis was resolved and the invasion canceled. O’Connor was a very seasoned and experienced young man in November 1963. Both O’Connor and Curtis Jenkins had assisted in over sixty autopsies and had gone through the training program for pathology technicians at Bethesda Naval Hospital. But what is unusual about O’Connor was that from the age of fourteen until he joined the Navy, he had been a general helper in a funeral home; he had many years’ experience working with dead bodies. The point is that it is very unlikely that Paul was thrown into a state of shock and blind confusion when the president’s body arrived at the morgue. He is a very clear thinker. This was observed in the HSCA’s interview of O’Connor, the first time he was interviewed: the HSCA noted that O’Connor repeated by memory the autopsy log number (A63272) of the president. “He said it without giving any indication that he had ever looked it up since the autopsy nearly fourteen years ago.” In my interview with Paul, he repeatedly exhibited that he had a very clear head and was not subject to exaggeration or flights of fantasy. He was a perfect witness: stable, sincere, honest, seasoned, with no ax to grind. Paul told me that shortly after President Kennedy’s autopsy he had gotten married. Soon after that he was sent to Vietnam. His wife, who was pregnant when he left, gave birth to their baby while he was still serving duty in Vietnam. He was there only a few months when, while accompanying a Marine company through a village, he was hit by a mortar shell and flipped end over end into a ravine. He suffered a severe back injury and was sent home to the United States where he was discharged from the service with a permanent disability. He then returned to his home in Florida and worked as a deputy sheriff for the next seven years in general crime work, which included crime scene investigations. Paul’s back injury became worse and worse until it forced him to retire in the late 1970s. When I met him at Washington National Airport in Washington, D.C., he had gotten out of a hospital bed that morning, against his wife’s wishes, to fly up to Washington from Miami. He told me that he had promised he was going to grant me this interview and he didn’t want to back out on his promise. He said his wife was worried about meeting a stranger like this, but he told her he was going to tell me everything he knew and “let it all hang out.” Paul was wearing an electric stimulator during the next three days to diminish his back pain. He appeared very tired and gaunt, but his mind was sharp, which will be evident as I relate his interview. After meeting at the airport, we had lunch at the hotel where we talked for a couple of hours. We then went up to my hotel room and started the taped interview: Twyman: Once again, Paul, just describe when you were in the morgue awaiting the arrival of the president and you and other people heard helicopters outside. O’Connor: Well, we were all in the morgue, preparing for the body to come in, when we did hear helicopters flying overhead. I distinctly remember, too, because one went to the"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"north side of the hospital; it sounded like he landed at the north side of the hospital and one landed in the rear someplace, very possibly the officer’s club parking lot. And soon after that, Dennis David and his crew intercepted a black hearse pulling up to the loading dock of the hospital; and they took out what was a pinkish-gray shipping casket. A shipping casket is used if the person dies in one part of the country and they put him in this casket and ship him to another part of the country where he is subsequently put into a nicer casket. These caskets just go back and forth, all over the country. And if they get damaged, so what? Twyman: Do private embalmers use these too? O’Connor: Yes, yes. Twyman: It’s just common for military and... O’Connor: Well, it wasn’t a military casket. Twyman: Oh, it wasn’t a military casket. It was more like a commercial shipping casket? O’Connor: It was more like a cheap commercial casket, nondescript and not ornate or anything like that. Twyman: O.K. So, Dennis David witnessed this hearse drive up and some civilians and a couple of guys in white smocks, as I understand it.... O’Connor: I don’t remember what Dennis said about that. Twyman: Well, he said that, at least Lifton wrote he did. And so explain to me why you believe that the shipping casket, when it was taken off the hearse, had Kennedy’s body in it. O’Connor: Well, it was a matter of maybe 30 or 40 seconds between getting the casket out of the hearse and getting the body into the morgue in the casket. Twyman: And the casket was brought into the morgue within 30 to 40 seconds, and immediately put down in the morgue, on a rack there, I guess? O’Connor: No, it was put down on the floor. (See O’Connor’s sketch of the morgue in Exhibit 13-5.) Twyman: Just put down on the floor? O’Connor: Then the group of men that brought it in left immediately with Dennis David and then we opened the casket. Twyman: And you were right there when the casket was opened? O’Connor: Yes. Twyman: And then what did you see? O’Connor: I saw a pinkish-gray body bag in the casket. Twyman: Pinkish-gray body bag? O’Connor: The bag was unzipped and the body was then placed on the table. Twyman: Who unzipped the bag? O’Connor: I don’t have any idea. Twyman: You remember seeing it unzipped, though? O’Connor: Yes, there were so many hands there. But I didn’t do it. I know I didn’t do it. It was zipped from the head down to the foot and I was at the head. Twyman: Then what did you see? O’Connor: The nude body with a sheet wrapped around his head. A bloody sheet."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":" Twyman: A sheet wrapped around his head. But was there any sheet wrapped around the body? O’Connor: Not that I know of, I can’t remember that. Twyman: I remember that Aubrey Rike said they wrapped the body in a sheet. And then you saw it in the body bag but with the sheet around the head. And Aubrey Rike had said that the head was wrapped in a towel, and you saw it wrapped in a sheet. O’Connor: Right. Twyman: So go on. O’Connor: The sheet was unwrapped by myself; and I think Boswell or Humes helped me unwrap it. I’m not really sure who it was. They took the sheet and threw it over in the corner against the wall, which we had to clean up later on, and I was standing right at the head where I observed a huge gaping hole in the side of the president’s head. Twyman: The side? O’Connor: The right side of the head. It went from above the hairline on the right side through the parietal and the occipital area and down and around to the right temporal area of the skull. Twyman: Can you recall how close it came to the hairline in the back of the head? O’Connor: Maybe an inch and a half. Twyman: Above the hairline in the back of the head? O’Connor: Yes, right. Twyman: What was the shape of this wound? Was it a smooth shape, or was it jagged? Or...? O’Connor: It was a very irregular jagged wound. And what astounded me is when I looked at it, I had never seen anything like it in my life. And it looked like a bomb went off inside of his head. We noticed when we lifted him onto the table that the rest of the skull that was supposed to be attached was all fractured to pieces too. Just his whole skull was almost destroyed. The whole skull had multiple fractures on the left side. [ Author’s note: the large wound was mainly on the top right and rear of the skull.] Twyman: You said before it was comminuted. O’Connor: Comminuted. Like somebody takes a hard-boiled egg and drops it on the floor; thousand of fractures to it. And that’s the way the president’s skull was. Twyman: Now, when you first saw him... I’ve got this photograph here that is the top of the head photograph, Exhibit 13-6, is that what you first saw? O’Connor: Yes, I did. Twyman: O.K., then to see the wound.... O’Connor: You had to part the scalp back, and pull the hair out of the way, and you could look into the cranium. Twyman: Who parted that scalp back? O’Connor: I did. Twyman: You parted the scalp back and that’s when you first saw down into the cranium? O’Connor: Right. Twyman: And were there any comments made by anybody around the table? O’Connor: There was a lot of talk, and a lot of ambient noise, so it was hard for me to pick up anyone talking."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":" Twyman: And that was this jagged wound. O.K. Let’s look at another photo, the large defect photo, Exhibit 13-7. Does the shape of that wound look like what you saw, after you parted his scalp back? O‘Connor: Yes it does. Twyman: And looking at Exhibit 13-7, up at the top in the left-hand corner, there is a flap of scalp folded back. So, to see if I understood properly what you told me before, that flap of scalp you can see was a flap of scalp in the top of the head that had been laid back? O’Connor: Right. Twyman: Now did you actually look back under the skull there to see if there was missing brain all the way back? O’Connor: There was missing brain most of the way. There was probably a handful of macerated brain tissue which, if it was put together, would constitute maybe a quarter of the brain. [76] It was splattered all the way inside the brain. Another thing I want to point out to you too is that the fact that these pictures were taken before the actual autopsy started. Twyman: Yes. O’Connor: So if there was a brain in there, you would have seen it. Twyman: Yes. O’Connor: And you don’t see anything in there. Twyman: We’ve already discussed at lunch how Jacqueline and Robert Kennedy arrived with the ambulance at the Bethesda front entrance at 6:55 p.m. And then it is at 7:05 p.m., there on the left column on the timeline (Exhibit 13-2) where Jerrol Custer is carrying the x-rays, with an FBI agent or a Secret Service agent escorting him. O’Connor: That’s correct. Twyman: Now maybe you can describe to me your exchange with Jerrol Custer when he came back to the morgue, after that trip. O’Connor: Well, he re-entered the morgue and he was kind of excited and said guess who I saw, and I said who’s that, and he said Jackie Kennedy just walked in the front of the hospital. Now I didn’t think that much about it until years later when we started to figure how this time fit in with the fact that we have the body back here already in the morgue and the ambulance pulls up front with her in it with the bronze casket. Twyman: And you know that Custer had already taken x-rays? O’Connor: Oh yes. As a matter of fact he was on his way up with an arm-full of exposed x-rays to get them developed. Twyman: Yes, and you mentioned before that he was sort of flabbergasted about that? Or...? O’Connor: Well, he was just a little excited. Twyman: Excited, I see. In other words, it was emphatic, that’s what brought it to your attention forcefully that this had happened. O’Connor: Yes, right. Twyman: The other thing is that Dennis David has said that, after he had seen the casket arrive in the black hearse, he said 20 minutes, maybe 30 minutes later he had gone into an office on the second floor looking down from the second floor balcony to the entrance to the hospital and he saw not only her come in, he saw the motorcade arrive. "},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"O’Connor: Right. Twyman: And he saw Robert and Jacqueline Kennedy get out of the ambulance and come in and he didn’t know the times but he knew that one was well after the other. In other words, he saw her come in well after he had seen the hearse and casket arrive in the back, and then if I tie that into what you tell me—that it was just 30 or 40 seconds after he saw that casket taken out of the black hearse—that it was brought in and immediately opened; and there you saw Kennedy’s body in it. O’Connor: Right. Twyman: Let’s go back into one more thing we discussed. I questioned what sort of logic or proof there was that Kennedy’s body was actually in that shipping casket that Dennis David observed when it was unloaded and they took it into the morgue. And you told me that Dennis David didn’t see into the casket, he didn’t see it opened, but you did? O’Connor: The loading dock is in the rear of the hospital. When you leave the loading dock and go into the hospital, your first left turn is the morgue. It would only take you about a few seconds to off-load that casket and rush it in. I’d say they did rush it into the morgue that way. Dennis never opened the casket; he left. Twyman: And so when you opened the casket, the body had to have been in there. I am just trying to think of some reason, no matter how remote, that an empty casket came in. But there was a body in this casket? O’Connor: Absolutely. Twyman: Are you sure it was only 30 or 40 seconds after? O’Connor: Oh, yes. Twyman: How do you know that? O’Connor: Because Dennis told me. He said that, “as soon as we got up there we carried it right into the morgue.” Twyman: Right into the morgue? O’Connor: And he said he observed it being in a pinkish-gray shipping casket. Recapping the essential items thus far in O’Connor’s statements: (1) The body arrived in a commercial shipping casket as opposed to the bronze casket in which it left Dallas. (2) The body arrived in a zippered body bag as opposed to being wrapped in a sheet when it left Dallas. (3) There was a huge, gaping, irregular hole in the back, top, and right side of Kennedy’s head when the body arrived at Bethesda, as opposed to a three-inch hole in the back of the head when it left Dallas (according to Parkland Hospital witnesses). (4) The body arrived at the rear of the Bethesda hospital in a hearse before the Navy ambulance arrived at the front of the hospital with the bronze casket. This is confirmed by the statements of Jerrol Custer and Dennis David. (5) The brain was almost completely gone when the body arrived at Bethesda, as opposed to being at least two-thirds intact when the body left Dallas (according to Parkland Hospital witnesses). The implication of all this is inescapable: there was a major conspiracy to cover up evidence in the"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"JFK assassination by the executive branch of the federal government. Corroboration of Statements of O’Connor, David, and Custer The other Navy enlisted man on the autopsy team was James Curtis Jenkins. David Lifton interviewed Jenkins in September 1979, after he had first interviewed Paul O’Connor. Jenkins was nineteen years old at the time of the autopsy. Lifton had hoped to confirm the “body bag” story but Jenkins couldn’t remember how the body was wrapped. He did remember putting a brain in formaldehyde that night and he remembered that the body had been brought into the morgue in a plain, simple casket, “...it was not something you’d expect a President to be in....”He told Lifton that “at least one-third of the skull was gone when Kennedy was brought in.” He described the wound as a hole that extended toward the rear and, in his opinion, had the appearance of an exit wound that struck from the right front and exploded toward the rear. [77] Although Jenkins’ recollections did not exactly dovetail with O’Connor’s, there were no significant discrepancies. I discussed Jenkins’ statement—that he remembered putting a brain in formaldehyde—with Paul O’Connor, and asked if that could have been the one-fourth of the remaining brain that O’Connor had acknowledged. O’Connor agreed that it might have been, but said that he himself did not remember removing any brain from the cranium. The fact that different eyewitnesses remember different things or slightly different things is, of course, widely recognized in criminal investigations. Accordingly, I concluded it should not be surprising that Jenkins did not remember a body bag. It was O’Connor who was up close to the body when the body bag was unzipped, and Jerrol Custer had confirmed that there was a body bag. Also, years later, Captain John Stover, commanding officer of the Navy Medical School, had remembered there was a body bag. He told Lifton, “I think there was a body bag.” He said, “I remember seeing a body bag....I think I remember seeing a body bag peeled off.” [78] (Paul O’Connor told me that Captain Stover threatened him and others with court martial and imprisonment in the federal penitentiary if they talked with anyone about the autopsy.) There is more corroboration of the decoy ambulance and therefore the credibility of O’Connor’s, David’s, and Custer’s accounts. David Lifton interviewed Donald Rebentisch of Coopersville, Michigan, a chief petty officer who was stationed at Bethesda on the night of the autopsy. Lifton’s interview was conducted before the local paper, the Grand Rapids Press, was about to publish a story (on January 23, 1981) that Rebentisch had told them. Rebentisch had been telling his family this story for years. Lifton wrote: “...I was able to interview Rebentisch before he read Best Evidence . He provided corroboration for Dennis David’s account by recalling that he had helped unload the first casket, an ordinary shipping casket, and that it had arrived at the back before the gray Navy ambulance arrived at the front. Rebentisch said that after unloading the first casket, he went upstairs to the lobby area of Bethesda where he saw Mrs. Kennedy, who had just arrived in the Navy ambulance, waiting for the elevator.” [79] In other words, Rebentisch had the same experience as Dennis David. Now there is additional, recently discovered evidence corroborating Paul O’Connor’s statements and the statements of Dennis David and Jerrol Custer. This evidence is a document sifted out of the millions of pages in the National Archives by my researcher Anna Marie Kuhns-Walko. In her computer searches she found an HSCA interview of Lt. Richard A. Lipsey dated January 18, 1978 that had been buried in"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"secrecy for sixteen years. The interview had been conducted by HSCA staff members Donald Andrew Purdy, Jr., and T. Mark Flanagan, Jr. To my knowledge, this is the first government document ever released that specifically tells of a decoy ambulance at the front of Bethesda Hospital and the body being delivered in a separate hearse at the rear. [80] It reads: The Select Committee on Assassinations interviewed Richard Lipsey because of his presence at the autopsy of John Kennedy. Since Mr. Lipsey chose to tape this interview; we also taped. This memorandum represents a summary of the tape recordings. No transcript has been made to date. Lipsey began the interview by mentioning that he signed a document in his office about one week after the assassination which forbade him from revealing any information about the autopsy. He believes this had a 15-year limitation. After asking us about the validity of this agreement, we responded by saying that we wished he would respond on a voluntary basis and that it was the Committee’s opinion that no harm would occur. Lipsey mentioned that these orders originated from a Colonel Holden. Lipsey agreed to cooperate and supply any information that he could. Lipsey stated that he was born on October 7, 1939 in Selma, Alabama. He came to Washington, D.C., when he was selected as an aide to General Wehle. He said that Wehle’s office would handle all ceremonial military functions in Washington. After the assassination, Lipsey said that he and Wehle met the body at Andrews Air Force Base and placed it in a hearse to be transported to Bethesda Naval Hospital. Lipsey mentioned that he and Wehle then flew by helicopter to Bethesda and took JFK into the back of Bethesda. A decoy hearse had been driven to the front. After bringing the body into Bethesda, Lipsey said that Jackie Kennedy and the family entered the front of Bethesda and traveled to the “Presidential Suite.” [ Author’s note: It is not completely clear here whether the body was transported to Bethesda Hospital in a helicopter or a hearse. Lipsey, to me, seems to be saying that it was in a hearse.] Lipsey next stated that General Wehle ordered him not to leave the body for any reason.... [81] (Emphasis added) Not only had the HSCA concealed its interview of Paul O’Connor in archival secrecy, it had done the same to the confirming interview of Lt. Richard Lipsey. The two interviews corroborate each other in that Lipsey mentions a decoy hearse at the front of the hospital. The “decoy” certainly appears to be the Navy ambulance carrying the Kennedy party and the bronze casket, without Kennedy’s body in it. And now, in 1994, we find that in 1978 the HSCA, appointed by the U.S. government to investigate the crime, had not revealed this obviously important evidence. It seems that the foregoing accounts from nine credible, corroborating witnesses would convince a jury of proof of a conspiracy to steal Kennedy’s body for sinister purposes. Here is a summary of the statements of the witnesses: Aubrey Rike & Dennis McGuire: -- Saw body placed in bronze ceremonial casket in Dallas. -- Saw body wrapped in sheets and placed on a plastic sheet in the bronze casket. -- Accompanied bronze casket to Air Force On e and saw it put aboard. Dr. Charles Crenshaw: -- Saw body placed in bronze ceremonial casket in Dallas. Saw body wrapped in sheets and placed on a plastic sheet in the bronze casket.

We have here multiple witnesses, all credible, all telling stories that all fit into a cohesive, air-tight case—proof of Allegation One, irrespective of resolution of the other allegations. [82] But there was more that begged to be examined. My next step was to study the matter of the missing brain The Missing Brain For what purpose would the conspirators go to the extreme act of stealing the body of the assassinated president of the United States? Logic would seem to dictate that there is one answer, to the exclusion of all others: The body was stolen to conceal the fact of a conspiracy that would have been revealed by the"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"nature of the president’s wounds, and/or the presence of bullet fragments in the president’s body or brain that would not have matched Oswald’s rifle. We must remember that the president’s body was removed from the bronze casket before Air Force One left Dallas. So it seems that it must have been planned in advance of the assassination. It is difficult for me to imagine that such a plan was cooked up within two hours after the president was murdered. To approach this issue, I now elected to focus on Paul O’Connor’s testimony of the status of the president’s body when it arrived at Bethesda Naval Hospital. I would look for scientific or forensic evidence to corroborate O’Connor’s testimony concerning the condition of the brain when he first saw Kennedy’s body. A key part of his testimony was that almost all of the brain was missing. O’Connor stated that, except for a small portion of lacerated tissue, the brain was completely gone. He is adamant on this. When I questioned O’Connor on this subject, he had conceded that he did not make a thorough inspection of the inside of the cranium and that perhaps as much as one-fourth of the total brain was still remaining. So I started with that premise. O’Connor’s statements have been corroborated, at least in part, by Jerrol Custer, who stated that he could have put both of his fists down into the open wound in Kennedy’s head. Moreover, there is compelling, inferential evidence that the brain was missing by virtue of the fact that the photographs of the brain in the National Archives are in sharp disagreement with the testimonies of at least four doctors at Parkland Hospital; they described the condition of the massive wound at the rear of the president’s head as having large quantities of cerebellar tissue and other brain matter extruding from the wound. Therefore, the autopsy photographs appear to be of a substitute brain. Let us examine the condition of the brain as shown in the autopsy photos. Exhibit 13-8 is an exact drawing of a top view of the brain from one of the autopsy photos. The U.S. government has not to this date allowed the autopsy photos to be copied or taken out of the National Archives, [83] but they did commission an artist (Ida Dox) to make this drawing. Dr. David Mantik, who has examined all seven of the photographs of the brain in the National Archives (along with the drawing), has assured me that this drawing is an accurate representation of a top view of the brain as it appears in the autopsy photos. It shows a perfectly intact cerebellum. It also shows severe lacerations in the right hemisphere of the brain. (The cerebellum is the tissue in the two triangular-shaped pieces at the bottom of the drawing.) Cerebellar tissue, I am told by Dr. Robert Livingston (nationally recognized expert on the structure of the brain), is distinctly different in texture from other brain tissue and is easily recognized by virtually any competent medical doctor. [84] This is evident in Exhibit 13-8. The cerebellum has a surface of narrow, parallel grooves (folia) in contrast to the remainder of the surface of the brain which is relatively smooth. The significance of this visually obvious difference that distinguishes the cerebellum is realized when we examine the testimonies of doctors who observed the head wound at Parkland Hospital in Dallas. Their statements all agree in testifying to the fact that parts of cerebellar tissue had been blown out of the back of the head and were extruding from the open wound. Following are four of these testimonies, excerpted from the Warren Commission Report. These were all testimonies taken under oath shortly after the assassination and are the statements of eyewitness, expert physicians—the very best kind of testimonial evidence: Dr. Marion T. Jenkins There was a great laceration on the right side of the head (temporal and occipital), causing a great defect in the skull plate so that there was herniation and laceration of great areas of the brain, even to the extent that cerebellum had protruded from the wound . WCR, p. 530 (Emphasis added)"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" Dr. Charles J. Carrico The wound that I saw was a large gaping wound, located in the right occipitoparietal area. I would estimate to be about 5 to 7 cm in size, more or less circular, with avulsions of the calvarium and scalp tissue. As I stated before, I believe there was shredded macerated cerebral and cerebellar tissues both in the wounds and on the fragments of the skull attached to the dura. W.C. Vol. VI, p. 6 (Emphasis added) Dr. Robert N. McClelland As I took the position at the head of the table that I have already described, to help out with the tracheotomy, I was in such a position that I could very closely examine the head wound, and I noted that the right posterior portion of the skull had been extremely blasted. It had been shattered, apparently, by the force of the shot so that the parietal bone was protruded up through the scalp and seemed to be fractured almost along its right posterior half, as well as some of the occipital bone being fractured in its lateral half, and this sprung open the bones that I mentioned in such a way that you could actually look down into the skull cavity itself and see that probably a third or so, at least, of the brain tissue, posterior cerebral tissue and some of the cerebellar tissue had been blasted out. There was a large amount of bleeding which was occurring mainly from the large venous channels in the skull which had been blasted open. W.C. Vol. VI, p. 33 (Emphasis added) Dr. William Kemp Clark [85] I then examined the wound in the back of the president’s head. This was a large, gaping wound in the right posterior part, with cerebral and cerebellar tissue being damaged and exposed. W.C. Vol. VI, p. 20 (Emphasis added) The point here is that the photographs of the brain in the National Archives show no damage to the cerebellum . The above testimonies, sworn under oath by experienced medical doctors who observed the head wound, clearly and unambiguously describe extruded and damaged cerebellar tissue. If their testimonies are correct, and there is no reason to believe they are not, then the photographs of the brain in the National Archives are not of Kennedy’s brain. They must therefore be the brain of someone other than Kennedy. For what reasons would someone else’s brain be substituted? The most obvious reason is that Kennedy’s real brain had been re-moved—for the most part—before the body arrived at Bethesda Naval Hospital. Either that, or the brain remaining in the skull when the body arrived may have been so mutilated by a bullet or bullet fragments exiting from the rear of the skull, or by hurried dissections on the part of conspirators—to remove bullets and bullet fragments from the brain, that would have revealed the true nature of the president’s head and brain wounds, and thus establish that there had been more than one gunman. [86] Another doctor who was present in the emergency room in Dallas Parkland Hospital was Dr. Charles A. Crenshaw. In his book JFK: Conspiracy of Silence , published in 1992, Crenshaw wrote: ...from the damage I saw, there was no doubt in my mind that the bullet had entered his head through the front, and as it surgically passed through his cranium, the missile obliterated part of the temporal and all the parietal and occipital lobes before it lacerated the cerebellum. The wound resembled a deep furrow in a freshly plowed field.... [87] Expert corroboration that the photograph of the brain in the National Archives labeled as Kennedy’s brain is, in fact, of someone else’s brain was provided by Dr. Robert Livingston in a presentation that he gave at the ASK Conference in Dallas in November 1993. He said:"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" It simply cannot be true that the cerebellum could have been seen extruding from the occipital- parietal wound—by several experienced and thoroughly competent physicians—and for the same brain to be seen in superior and lateral photographs, and depicted in a drawing (superior view) showing the cerebellum as being apparently intact. A conclusion is obligatorily forced, therefore, that the photographs and the drawing of the brain in the National Archives are those of some brain other than that of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. ” [88] (Emphasis added) There is much more to be said about the missing brain. It is perhaps the most ghoulish example of destruction of evidence by government in the JFK assassination. One very suspicious item is a notation in a supplementary autopsy report (prepared by Drs. Humes, Fink, and Boswell) that the brain weight was 1500 grams. How strange, when 1500 grams is an above-average normal weight for a human brain. When we note that about one-third of the brain had been blown away in Dallas, as evidenced by statements of the doctors at Parkland Hospital and also as dramatically indicated in the Zapruder film, it is strange indeed that all three of these doctors would sign their name to a report stating that the brain weighed 1500 grams— an i mpossible weight, except for a completely intact brain in the extreme upper range of brain weights for humans. Dr. David Mantik has pointed out that this could not have been a simple mistake in the identity of a body part report. At the time the report was prepared, the only organ being examined was a brain. This report was presumably prepared two weeks after the autopsy had been completed. Why would the three doctors who conducted the autopsy write such a thing? No one has offered an explanation. As noted earlier, when the autopsy physicians had completed their examination of the brain, it was transferred to the Secret Service at the White House in a stainless steel container. [89] On April 26, 1965, the Secret Service transferred the autopsy materials to President Kennedy’s secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, then at the National Archives. She obtained a footlocker within one day to which she transferred the materials, and kept the footlocker in a security room in her office for about one month. The footlocker, with keys, was then, according to Lincoln, turned over to Robert Kennedy’s personal secretary, Angela Novello. Evelyn Lincoln presumed that it was moved to another part of the archives; she said that she had no more direct contact with the material. But an HSCA document indicated that the footlocker was removed from the National Archives by Robert Kennedy’s representatives and later returned. On October 31, 1966, the footlocker was officially turned over to the National Archives, at which time Novello produced a key, the footlocker was opened, and it was discovered that the brain and tissue slides were missing. What happened to them remains a mystery to this day. The HSCA concluded that they were probably disposed of or otherwise made inaccessible by Robert Kennedy. This was based in part on the speculation of Kennedy’s attorney, Burke Marshall. Marshall opined that Robert Kennedy wanted to avoid future public display of the brain. Others speculate that it was to avoid future public disclosure that President Kennedy had Addison’s disease and had kept it from the public. Ironically, if there was a brain in the container, it not that of President Kennedy, as indicated by the evidence in this book. If Robert Kennedy did in fact dispose of the brain and tissue slides, he was destroying prime evidence of a conspiracy. [2009 Update: About the two different brains, go to Evidence of Government Cover up: Two Different Brain Specimens, [90] by Douglas P. Horne, Senior Analyst for ARRB. Mr. Horne amplifies and confirms what I have written here.]"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"The Enlarged Head Wound FBI agents Sibert and O’Neill were assigned to observe the autopsy and prepare a report of what they saw and heard. In their report, dated November 26, 1963, is a startling statement: The president’s body was removed from the casket in which it had been transported and was placed on the autopsy table, at which time the complete body was wrapped in a sheet and the head area contained an additional wrapping which was saturated with blood. Following the removal of the wrapping, it was ascertained that the president’s clothing had been removed and it was also apparent that a tracheotomy had been performed, as well as surgery of the head area, namely, in the top of the skull . All personnel with the exception of medical officers needed in the taking of photographs and x-rays were requested to leave the autopsy room and remain in an adjacent room. (Emphasis added) The importance of this statement—that surgery had been performed in the top of the head—is extremely significant because surgery had not been performed on the top of the head at Parkland Hospital; only a small incision had been made in the throat wound for the purpose of inserting a tracheotomy tube. Sibert and O’Neill later stated that they were quoting statements of the autopsy pathologist in their report. Corroboration of the accuracy of the statement about surgery in the head was, in part, provided by Dr. Humes himself, when he telephoned Dr. Perry the next day at Dallas and asked him if any surgery had been performed at Parkland Hospital. Dr. Perry replied that none had been performed. Why would Humes be asking Dr. Perry if surgery had been performed on the head if he had not been puzzled by what he saw? [91] Simple logic tells us that if surgery had been performed on the top of the head when the body arrived at Bethesda, and if it had not been performed at Parkland Hospital, then it must have been performed sometime between the time the body left Parkland and when it was taken into the Bethesda Naval Hospital. This of course leads to the conclusion that surgery was performed when the body was in the possession of the conspirators, after they had removed it from the casket placed aboard Air Force One in Dallas. This all dovetails with the statements of Paul O’Connor and Jerrol Custer that the brain was almost completely missing when the body arrived at Bethesda, and it dovetails with the evidence, previously discussed, that the photographs of the brain in the National Archives are not of Kennedy’s brain but rather a substitute brain. We now arrive at the question of the size of the head wound observed at Bethesda Hospital compared to that observed at Parkland Hospital. How much was the wound enlarged? To what extent did the conspirators have to go to accomplish their purposes? To answer these questions, we can examine the statements of the doctors at Parkland Hospital with the statements of the doctors at Bethesda Hospital, along with actual photographs and sketches of the head wound. All of the doctors at Parkland Hospital stated that there was an exit wound in the back of Kennedy’s head (indicating a shot from the front). Only one of the doctors, Dr. Carrico, gave a numerical estimate of the size of the wound—“about 5 cm by 7 cm in size” [92] (2 to 2 ¾ inches). This was corroborated by David Lifton in a November 1966 phone call to Dr. Paul Peters who was also in attendance in the emergency room with Dr. Carrico. Dr. Peters volunteered, “about 7 cm across” [93] (2 ¾ inches). As noted earlier, Dr. Robert McClelland, in his testimony to the Warren Commission, described a wound in the back of the head corresponding roughly to the numerical descriptions by Drs. Carrico and Peters. Thus we have three doctors at Parkland Hospital, who were attending to Kennedy, agreeing that there was a"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"wound of approximately 2 ½ to 3 inches in size, located in the back of the head. How does this compare to the wound as described by the doctors and photographs at the autopsy in Bethesda Hospital? In his autopsy report, Dr. Humes wrote, “There is a large irregular defect of the scalp and skull on the right involving chiefly the parietal bone but extending somewhat into the temporal and occipital regions. In this region there is an actual absence of scalp and bone producing a defect which measures approximately 13 cm (5.1 inches) in greatest diameter.” Dr. Humes’ dimension was partially corroborated in a sketch (Exhibit 13-10) prepared by Dr. Boswell, the autopsy pathologist who was co-responsible for the autopsy. He showed a portion of the skull labeled “missing” as 10 by 17 cm in size. (This corresponds to 4 by 7.6 inches.) Therefore, Dr. Humes is in substantial agreement with the dimensions labeled by Dr. Boswell. There is further corroboration of the estimates of Dr. Humes and Dr. Boswell in the photograph of the large defect in the skull shown in Exhibit 13-7. I made a dimensional outline of this wound by tracing over the photograph. This is shown in Exhibit 13-9. It shows a wound dimension of 10 cm and 18 cm (4 inches by 7 inches). There has been a controversy about the orientation of the large defect photograph in Exhibit 13-7. A few have claimed it was solely at the top of the head (not the back of the head), and turned around 180° from that described in the caption. But Dr. Humes’ report conclusively negates that argument. Dr. Humes described the large defect as encompassing chiefly the parietal region and extending into the occipital and temporal regions which is consistent with the sketch of the defect shown in Exhibit 13-11 and Dr. Boswell’s sketch in Exhibit 13-10, and is consistent with a shot from the front having blown out a portion of the skull in the rear of the head, as was also established in the voluminous evidence in Chapters 10, 11, and 12, as well as by eyewitness testimonies that have been noted. It is also consistent with the description of Paul O’Connor and the orientation of the head when the photograph was taken by John Stringer, Jr. To recap at this point: Three of the doctors at Parkland reported seeing a wound in the back of the head with a dimension of 2 ½ to 3 inches; Drs. Humes and Boswell at Bethesda reported seeing a wound in the back and top of the head with a largest dimension of 13 cm to 17 cm (5 inches by 7 inches). This is in very close agreement with Dr. Boswell’s sketch and Dr. Humes’ description, but it is grossly larger than the description of the wound by the doctors at Parkland Hospital. If we take the largest dimension mentioned at Parkland (3 inches) which corresponds to an area of 7 square inches—and compare it to the smallest dimension at Bethesda (5 inches) corresponding to an area of 19.6 square inches, we have a discrepancy of nearly three to one in the size of the wound observed at Bethesda compared to that observed at Parkland. There has been a controversy on this subject among dedicated researchers, most of whom believe there was a conspiracy. Some assert that the wound was the same size at Bethesda as it was at Parkland, the apparent difference in size being caused by a flap of scalp obscuring the full extent of the wound at Parkland; the postulated reason being that, inasmuch as the doctors at Parkland did not examine the body (it was not their job to examine the body), they did not part the scalp to observe the full size of the wound [94] This controversy exists even among those who believe that there was a conspiracy involving the federal government, including forgery of the motion picture films. I agree with the view of David Lifton—that the wound was in fact greatly enlarged by the conspirators sometime after they removed the body from the bronze casket in Air Force One. The reasoning has been stated: Sibert and O’Neill’s report of surgery on the head; Paul O’Connor and Jerrol Custer’s statements of the essentially empty cranium when the body arrived at Bethesda; the evidence that the photographs of the brain are not of Kennedy’s brain and, finally, the ultimate complete disappearance of the brain. All of this is entirely consonant with the head wound having been enlarged in order for the"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"conspirators to get at the brain before the autopsy. Those who wish to believe that the head wound was the same at Bethesda as it was at Parkland because the flap of scalp obscured the wound at Parkland are, of course, free to do so. But to me it seems self-evident that the conspirators would not have gone to the extreme risk of stealing the president’s body, taking it to a secret location, and then smuggling it into the rear of Bethesda Naval Hospital had they not had some drastic purpose in mind, such as modifying basic evidence. And how could that be done without manipulating the skull and altering or removing the brain, however crudely accomplished? From a commonsense viewpoint, is it reasonable to believe that the experienced doctors at Parkland Hospital would describe what they saw as a 2 ½ - to 3-inch hole in the back of the head if it had been blown away as shown in the autopsy photograph? And is it reasonable to think that all of the five Navy enlisted people who participated in the autopsy are lying and the commissioned officers are telling the truth? The Navy enlisted men have been willing to come forth, be questioned, appear on television, and be subjected to cross-examination by the public, whereas the commissioned officers have not talked with anyone except under the most benign, controlled conditions from friendly government investigators, or from a friendly Journal of the American Medical Association . Furthermore, is it reasonable to think that several doctors at Parkland Hospital, including a neurosurgeon, would confuse extruded cerebellum with other brain tissue? And what about the brain weight of 1500 grams in the autopsy report when there is no doubt whatsoever that a portion of the brain was blown out at Dealey Plaza in Dallas? The Moral Dilemma of Commander Humes On November 22, 1963, Commander James Humes was assigned the project of supervising the autopsy of the assassinated president. At that time, Commander Humes was chief of pathology at Bethesda Naval Hospital. His main duties were of an administrative nature. He had performed relatively few autopsies, and none involving gunshot wounds. Nevertheless, he was given the job. His life would be changed forever. He presided over an autopsy that is now commonly recognized as being either fraudulent or the most bungled in all of history. I first want to make it clear that I do not believe that Dr. Humes, Dr. Boswell, or Dr. Finck were involved in the conspiracy that murdered John F. Kennedy. I have reached the opinion that they were the victims of intimidation and duplicity on the part of the executive branch of the federal government, in the guise of the necessity of a cover-up for national security purposes. There is evidence to support the contention that the Navy pathologists participated, perhaps unwittingly, in a cover-up and that it was intimidation from above that compelled them. “Above” refers to the White House itself, most probably under direct orders from Lyndon Johnson. Much more will be written in a later chapter concerning Lyndon Johnson’s incredible hands-on orchestration of a cover-up. But let us begin with the notes of Lt. Col. Pierre Finck, one of the three pathologists who conducted the autopsy of President Kennedy. These notes were recently obtained by Anna Marie from the National Archives. Dr. Finck wrote: “Before the Warren Report became public on 28 Sep 1964, I received instructions from the White House thru channels not to discuss the autopsy of Pres Kennedy beyond the contents of the Warren Report....” (Emphasis added). Attached to Finck’s notes was the following startling memorandum that he had written: 11 Sep 64 I am called by Capt Stover, CO of Naval Med School. He tells me that Adm Burkley, White House physician called him. The Warren Commission Report will be released to the Press shortly."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"However, the prosectors [sic] involved in Kennedy’s autopsy are still required not to release information to the press. Inquiries should be referred to the White House Press Office. Brig Gen Blumberg, AFIP Director, calls me within two hours, notifying me of the same White House orders. (Emphasis added) There is further evidence that, from the beginning, the autopsy was under control of the executive branch of the federal government, namely the FBI. This evidence is from Dr. Robert Livingston, [95] who provided me with the following transcript of a report he presented to the ASK Conference in Dallas on November 22, 1993, and at a news conference in New York on November 18, 1993. He wrote: Because of my prior experience as Scientific Director for two of the National Institutes of Health; concurrently for the National Institute for Mental Health and the National Institute for Neurological Diseases and Blindness; because I had met President Kennedy while serving in the U.S. Public Health Service during the transition from Eisenhower to Kennedy, and throughout the Kennedy administration; because I had met several Cabinet members and other principals, and, most importantly, because my scientific knowledge and professional responsibilities were directly pertinent to the conduct of the president’s autopsy and interpretations of damage to his nervous system, I paid careful attention to the unfolding of news on November 22, 1963. Thereby I learned that: (a) there was a small frontal wound in the president’ throat, and (b) substantial parts of his cerebellum were extruding from the wound in the back of his head. Because the wound of entry in the front of his neck required that the president had to have been assaulted frontally, this seemed to me to be a matter of utmost importance for the autopsy. I therefore telephoned from my home in Bethesda to the Bethesda Naval Hospital where the autopsy was to be performed. This was prior to arrival of the president’s casket from Dallas to Andrews Air Force Base. I was put though to the Officer of the Day who quickly provided me telephone access to Commander James Humes who was to head the autopsy team. Dr. Humes said he had not heard much reporting from Dallas and Parkland Hospital because he had been occupied preparing to conduct the autopsy. I told him about reports describing the small wound in the president’s neck. I stressed that, in my experience, that would be evidence for a wound of entry. I emphasized the importance of carefully tracing the path of this projectile and of establishing the location of the bullet or any fragments. I said, carefully, that if that wound were confirmed as a wound of entrance, that would prove beyond peradventure of doubt that a bullet had been fired from in front of the president —hence that if there were shots from behind, there had to have been more than one gunman. At just that moment, there was an interruption in our conversation. Dr. Humes returned after a pause to say, “Dr. Livingston, I’m sorry, but I can’t talk with you any longer. The FBI won’t let me. ” I wished him good luck, and the conversation ended. (Emphasis added) The significance of this is that Dr. Humes was informed by Dr. Livingston, unambiguously, before the autopsy started , that the front neck wound was probably an entry wound. Dr. Humes wrote that he learned about the neck wound the next day when he telephoned Dr. Perry in Dallas, and Dr. Perry had described the wound as a “puncture wound” in the front of the neck, “approximately at the midline.” [96] Not only that, Dr. Humes did not probe or dissect the neck wound to determine its nature or direction, despite having been forewarned by an imminent medical scientist in a high position in the federal government at that time. Although one may write this off as a slip of the mind under the extraordinary pressure of the moment, it is difficult to believe that Dr. Humes would have completely forgotten what Dr. Livingston, a fellow medical doctor in the United States government, had told him, in no uncertain terms, in the telephone call."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"We can now add to the above the appalling incompleteness of the autopsy when it was declared to be complete in the early hours of the morning of November 23, 1963. Dr. Humes and the other members of the autopsy team: (a) Had not determined the path of the bullet that entered Kennedy’s back ( a cursory probe indicated only a finger-length depth of penetration); (b) Had not probed or dissected the wound in the front of the neck; (c) Had not located an exit wound from Kennedy’s head; (d) Had been denied access to Kennedy’s clothing showing the bullet holes; and (e) Had been denied access to the autopsy photos. What they had observed was a huge, gaping hole in the right side, back, and top of Kennedy’s head which they were unable to make sense of. Only the next day, after the fact, would Humes cobble together a report that would arbitrarily connect the back wound that was six inches below the collar line to the throat wound, designating the throat wound arbitrarily as an exit wound when in fact it had been described as having the characteristics of an entrance wound, and disregarding the fact that in probing the back wound, the probe had stopped at no more than a finger length into the back. Then, on Sunday afternoon, November 24, Dr. Humes burned his original notes recorded at the autopsy in his fireplace. Why would Humes have burned his notes in such an important, historical autopsy? To me, the answer seems obvious: Dr. Humes must have burned his notes to eliminate discrepancies with his final re-port—discrepancies that would have, must have, been revealed had his original notes been retained. It is inescapable that if the clinical observations at Parkland and the autopsy evidence at Bethesda had been interpreted and reported accurately to the Warren Commission, it would have shattered the lone- assassin hypothesis. As is true for many aspects of this complex case, a book could be written on the subject of Dr. Humes, Dr. Boswell, and Dr. Finck. But suffice it to say, in my opinion there is little question that their actions and inactions speak of a cover-up, a concealment of facts, and a distortion of history. I do not believe that they were involved in the conspiracy. I do believe, however, that they were somehow misled and intimidated directly from the White House, under the guise of national security, to produce an autopsy report tailored to support the lone-gunman scenario that was being railroaded through the government. This position of the federal government on the autopsy, including the FBI and the CIA, has never been modified after thirty-three years of controversy, and after mountains of evidence to the contrary. At this point, I was satisfied that all five of my initial allegations had been sufficiently proven to have a high probability of standing up in a court of law. But there still remained one nagging question concerning the autopsy: the evidence reported by David Lifton that the body was delivered twice to the Bethesda morgue. In my interview with Paul O’Connor in Washington, D.C., I questioned him about this. He was adamant that the body had not been delivered to the morgue twice. This was in direct conflict with Lifton’s hypothesis that there had been a second casket opening with Humes, Boswell, and others present. O’Connor was certain that this had not occurred. Lifton’s hypothesis was that the casket switch had been made when all personnel were required to leave the autopsy room for x-rays to be taken—a period of about thirty minutes. O’Connor disputed this. He said that when he was ordered to leave the autopsy room he went into an adjacent anteroom where he stood observing everything going on in the autopsy room, “with his nose pressed against the window” in the connecting door. (See Exhibit 13-5.) O’Connor was certain that Kennedy’s body had remained on the autopsy table during the entire period and that a body/casket shell game had not been going on, at least in the autopsy room."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"After two days of off-and-on brainstorming on this subject, O’Connor and I finally came to a plausible alternative to Lifton’s hypothesis. Here is how it developed in our conversation: Twyman: The Navy ambulance, according to what we have developed here so far, had a bronze casket in it which was empty. The body was brought in a shipping casket from the rear of the morgue, and the Navy ambulance was driven back and forth from the front to the rear for some reason. O’Connor: You’ve got to remember something, too. There were thousands of people on the grounds near the hospital that night, just onlookers. And now this may be a scenario that goes with what we are talking about—deception of the public. Twyman: To make them think they were delivering a body in the Navy ambulance? O’Connor: Right. And so the people wouldn’t rush the ambulance and do something crazy. Twyman: Oh, you mean the double ambulance? O’Connor: Yes. I think there was probably deception and there were two ambulances. Twyman: Well, do you think that, from external appearance, the body presumably in the bronze casket must have been delivered to the morgue; and so the ambulance must have been driven around to the morgue at least once, even if the people driving it knew that the casket was empty, to give the appearance that the body had been delivered to the morgue in the bronze casket? Does that make sense? O’Connor: Yes, that makes sense; of course we never saw anything like that because we were in the morgue. Twyman: But they could have just driven it up to the dock. O’Connor: And then left. Twyman: With the bronze casket still in the ambulance. O’Connor: Right, exactly. Twyman: That has some plausibility. We’ve explained, so far, the black hearse, the bronze casket delivered to the morgue at 7:07 p.m. and Sibert and O’Neill kept out of the morgue. Now maybe somehow or other they were unaware that the casket was never taken into the morgue, this bronze casket; or if it were, maybe there’s another scenario: You’re in the morgue, working. The bronze casket could have been brought in and put down and then taken right back out. O’Connor: That’s a possibility. Twyman: That’s a possibility? O’Connor: It certainly is. Twyman: Okay. O’Connor: When these doors are closed, you can hardly see. Twyman: So the bronze casket could have been brought in, set down, and taken right back out and Sibert and O’Neill might have not even known, even though they accompanied it there, might have been gone for awhile, or they might have actually seen it happen and never wrote it in the report?"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" O’Connor: That’s true. Twyman: So that could explain the bronze casket being brought in for appearance and then taken right back out again. O’Connor: Yes. Twyman: And for anyone standing on the outside, that would look reasonable. They bring in the bronze casket, it goes inside, presumably it is opened, the body is taken out, the casket is taken back and put in the hearse and driven away. That could explain both of these trips. In other words, it could explain the black hearse, shipping casket, bronze casket in, bronze casket out. Anyway, I can see that there is an explanation for the appearance of the in-and-out Navy ambulance. Although the foregoing explanation seemed plausible, it still had flaws in it. If Lifton were correct, then Dr. Humes, Dr. Boswell, General McHugh, and a casket team member, James Felder, all witnessed the bronze casket being opened with a body in it that presumably was Kennedy. The delivery of the bronze casket to the morgue with Kennedy’s body in it was also indirectly confirmed by FBI agent O‘Neill when he was interviewed by the HSCA in 1978 by Andrew Purdy, who wrote: ...Upon arrival at Bethesda, O’Neill stated that the ambulance stopped at the front entrance where Jackie and RFK disembarked to proceed to the 17th floor. The ambulance then traveled to the rear where O’Neill, Sibert, Greer (Secret Service), and Kellerman (Secret Service) placed the casket on a roller and transported it into the autopsy room. O’Neill stated that he was present when various persons placed the body on the autopsy table. Doctors then proceeded to remove the sheet covering JFK and to photograph the body. O’Neill said that he remained “right next to the body,” a distance of closer than two yards. O’Neill said that Sibert, Greer and Kellerman were also present. In addition, Admiral Burkley, Kennedy’s personal physician, wrote in an affidavit for the HSCA in 1978: I traveled from Andrews Air Force Base in the ambulance with the President’s body and accompanied the coffin to the autopsy laboratory and saw the body removed and placed on the autopsy table. What we have here is testimonial evidence from credible witnesses that, when all taken together, lead to the conclusion that Kennedy’s body was delivered to the Bethesda morgue twice. If I hadn’t interviewed Paul O’Connor, I probably would have accepted Lifton’s thesis that the body was delivered the second time in the bronze casket while most of the key personnel had been ordered to leave the autopsy room while x-rays were being taken. But O’Connor’s testimony was so adamant and so convincing that I found myself in a dilemma. If all of these witnesses (including O’Connor) were correct, or if for the most part their statements were correct, there appeared to be only one answer: When the bronze coffin was delivered to the Bethesda morgue, the body in it was not that of John Kennedy, but a substitute body. I discussed this possibility with Paul O’Connor during the interview. O’Connor said that a strange thing had occurred on the night of the autopsy: he was told that the body of an Air Force major had been delivered to the anteroom in a coffin. O’Connor said that during the autopsy he was able to see, through the door, part of the coffin placed there. O’Connor said it was peculiar that an Air Force major’s body would be delivered to Bethesda because they normally handled only Navy personnel. He had never recalled Army or Air Force personnel being sent to Bethesda. I"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"suggested to O’Connor the possibility that when the bronze coffin was first brought in to the morgue, it was brought in to the anteroom empty. Then, the Air Force major’s body was placed in the coffin and it was then taken back out to the Navy ambulance where it was returned to the front of the hospital. It was at this point where the ambulance was joined with the casket team and the ambulance was then driven to the rear of the morgue where the bronze casket (with the Air Force major’s body in it) was removed from the ambulance, then taken into the anteroom of the morgue, and opened for viewing. The coffin was then closed and later removed from the anteroom with the Air Force major’s body in it. I asked O’Connor if it seemed possible that something like this could have happened from his vantage point during the autopsy. He said, yes, it was possible. When I returned to California, I called David Lifton and ran the hypothesis by him. He said, “If you write this in your book you will be completely discredited.” I also discussed Paul O’Connor’s statement that the bronze casket could not have been delivered to the autopsy room while he was out and the x-rays were being taken. Lifton was noncommittal. I was now stuck with an incredible hypothesis—not only of the conspirators stealing Kennedy’s body from Air Force One and secretly performing an obliteration of evidence, by surgery on the head, but further, concocting a scheme whereby they were able to fool almost everybody by playing a shell game of casket and body switches. It was too much to contemplate, so I went back and examined the evidence that the body was delivered in a shipping casket to the rear of the hospital while, at the same time, the Navy ambulance was parked at the front of the hospital with an empty bronze casket in it. After carefully reviewing this evidence, along with my previous development of evidence of forgery of the Zapruder film, and the evidence that the photographs of the brain that are now in the National Archives are not photographs of Kennedy’s brain, and the facts surrounding the disappearance of the brain, and the long list of credible witnesses who testify to all these events, I could think of no explanation of the second delivery of Kennedy’s body in the bronze casket other than that it was the body of someone other than Kennedy. For years I had pondered the fantastic evidence surrounding the autopsy. We have the spectacle of the conspirators seizing the Zapruder film on the day of the assassination and engaging in a highly sophisticated procedure to alter the film and delete frames. We have the forgery of evidence concerning the number of bullets; the ghoulish spectacle of the conspirators at some secret location, widening the opening in Kennedy’s skull, and partially removing his brain to eliminate incriminating bullets; and now the possibility that someone else’s body was secretly placed in the bronze coffin before it was delivered to Bethesda. Then I asked myself, why is this so unbelievable? First of all, the very idea of a conspiracy to assassinate the president of the United States, concocted by a band of criminals and government employees and carried out in a covert operation, was in itself unbelievable. But as evidence upon evidence piled up, all of these actions and manipulations remained in a coherent body. The fact that they are bizarre does not discredit them. Many crimes are bizarre; we all know of such. And particularly a crime to assassinate the president of the United States, in a conspiracy that went drastically awry, and for which desperate measures had to be taken to cover it up, would be bizarre to the extreme. Nonetheless, although there was no doubt in my mind that the essential story of theft of Kennedy’s body and alteration of the head wound was true, I was left with a sense of uncertainty about the intricacies of the delivery of the body to the morgue twice. Although the scenario just described seemed to fit, it still had a problem: it could not have happened without key people in the autopsy having participated in the cover-up. And some of them had to be lying in their testimonies. I had hoped to develop a scenario in which they were all unwitting of the game that was being played on them. But we should keep in mind that solving a crime does not require that every last detail and nuance be clarified with absolute certainty; otherwise few crimes would ever be solved."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"* * * The primary conclusions in this chapter will be reinforced when we examine the work of Dr. David Mantik, a medical doctor, radiation oncologist, and physicist at Eisenhower Memorial Hospital in Rancho Mirage, California.

Paul O’Connor said that this is exactly what he saw at Bethesda Naval Hospital after parting and reflecting back the scalp; and he agrees that it is a photo of the back and top of the head. At Parkland Hospital, doctors observed the brain extruding from a wound about three inches in diameter. Yet this photo shows an essentially empty cranium, without extruding brain, and a wound much larger than three inches. This evidence indicates that the brain was removed from the cranium sometime between the time the body left Parkland Hospital in Dallas and when it arrived at Bethesda Naval Hospital. For the orientation of this large defect on the skull, see Exhibit 13-11. Paul O’Connor agreed with me that this photo is a view of the rear of the head, looking at a downward angle. This was buttressed in an HSCA interview of John Thomas Stringer, Jr. (the photographer) on August 12, 1977, by Donald Andrew Purdy. Stringer said, “...the photographs of the back were taken when the body was held up and the photographs of the open head were taken while the head was held up. ” (Emphasis added) There is no indication of tampering with the above photo.

Note the distinctive appearance of the cerebellar portion of the brain when compared to the right and left cerebral hemispheres. Several physicians attending Kennedy at Parkland Hospital in Dallas testified under oath that the large portions of the cerebellum were extruded or were blasted out through a large wound (2 to 3 inches in diameter) in the occipital bone in the back of the head; yet this drawing shows a completely intact cerebellum. On the right is a midline view of a typical head and brain, which shows the location of the cerebellum in a vertical cross-section. Compare this to the location of the occipital bone in Exhibits 13-11 and 13-12, part of which was blasted out according to the doctors at Parkland Hospital. Moreover, a large piece of occipital bone was found behind and to the left of the presidential limousine on the day after the assassination. This is shown in Exhibit 13-13.

These comparisons are confirmation that Exhibit 13-7 is, in fact, the right side, back, and top of the president’s head. But the defect as shown here is much larger and more extensive than the wound described by personnel at Parkland Hospital in Dallas. In an interview of Dr. Marion Jenkins by the HSCA on November 10, 1977, the following was reported: Regarding the head wound, Dr. Jenkins said that only one segment of bone was blown out—it was a segment of occipital or tempora l bone.

(5.1 inches) in greatest diameter.” Dotted lines added by author approximate the perimeter of the large defect observed at Bethesda Naval Hospital Dr. Humes’ dimension was corroborated in a sketch (Exhibit 13-10) prepared by Dr. Boswell, autopsy pathologist co-responsible for the autopsy. He showed a portion of the skull labeled “missing” as 10 by 17 cm in size (this is 4 by 7.6 inches). Therefore, Dr. Humes is in substantial agreement with the dimensions labeled by Dr. Boswell. All of this is consistent with the photograph of the large irregular defect in Exhibit 13-7, and its dimensions shown in Exhibit 13-9.

Dr. Cairns examined it, along with another pathologist, and they both stated that it came from the occipital region of the skull. The fragment was photographed in the Methodist Hospital photographic lab. The bone fragment was then sent to Dr. George Burkley, the White House physician.

Gaeton Fonzi Investigator for Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and the House Select Committee on Assassinations 14 THE AUTOPSY PHOTOGRAPHS AND X-RAYS The autopsy photos and x-rays, along with the Zapruder film, were among the most carefully guarded and suppressed evidence in the JFK assassination. Only when Jim Garrison started his investigation in 1967 did Life magazine reluctantly part with the Zapruder film, and only then did it become available to the public by way of bootlegged copies made in the outside developing laboratory utilized by Life. Although the word “shocking” is now almost a cliché, it aptly describes the manner in which the autopsy photographs and x-rays were handled by the government. It is shocking to know that the unfortunate autopsy pathologists, Dr. Humes and Dr. Boswell, were not allowed to examine the photographs, and were only able to superficially examine the x-rays before finishing their report on the weekend after the assassination. Roy Kellerman of the Secret Service retained possession of the photographs and x-rays in the early morning of November 24 and turned them over to his chief, Robert Bouck, whose office was in the Executive Office building of the White House. It was not until three years after the autopsy that, finally, Humes and Boswell were called forth to examine them. And this was done under highly controlled conditions. If Secret Service agent James K. Fox had not somehow obtained a set of the photographs and x-rays (or, rather, a partial set) we might never have seen them. But Fox did obtain a partial set and made it available over the years until the dissemination was widespread. It was only then, when the cat was out of the bag, that the government allowed access to the photographs and x-rays in the National Archives, and then only to selected medical persons who were approved by Burke Marshall, friend and attorney of the Kennedy family. In this chapter, I will examine the autopsy x-rays as they relate to certain autopsy photographs that are considered to be authentic, and as related to the Zapruder film, and to the testimonies of the autopsy pathologists at Bethesda and the physicians at Parkland Hospital in Dallas. This will be discussed in the context of recent pioneer work by Dr. David Mantik, M.D., [97] a radiation oncologist (board-certified by the American College of Radiology) at Eisenhower Memorial Hospital in Rancho Mirage, California. Dr. Mantik became interested in this subject in 1992 and began to analyze and experiment with x-ray techniques to examine the possibility that the x-rays taken of Kennedy in the autopsy had somehow been altered to conceal the evidence. He arranged to visit the National Archives and examined the original x- ray negatives. He was the first (and as of now the only) researcher to use optical densitometry [98] as a means of measuring the characteristics of the Kennedy x-rays, with specific regard to their authenticity, and to detect whether or not they had been forged or altered in some manner. Over the years he has visited the National Archives six times, in each case pursuing his research and diligently making his precise measurements. He made thousands of measurements of the optical density of one-millimeter- diameter circles to survey the x-ray negatives. Several hundred individual measurements were made for each negative, in order to quantify and chart a pattern on the film of its capacity to transmit light from a constant source. Over that same period of time, Dr. Mantik experimented in his laboratory in Rancho Mirage to determine if it were possible to forge x-rays by making a composite from the original, using overlays to create the appearance of bone or brain in the x-rays when, in fact, they were absent. He also experimented with x-rays of human skulls that were filled in quadrants with brain-equivalent tissue to confirm his estimates of missing brain from Kennedy’s x-rays. Concurrently with this research he"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"analyzed the results of his optical measurements of the original x-rays in the National Archives. Rather than attempting to go fully into the technical details of optical densitometry, I will present here only my simplified understanding of the subject, and only to the extent required to attain a rudimentary grasp of Dr. Mantik’s work. It is really somewhat useless for the reader to try to delve into this x-ray evidence without at least a superficial knowledge of the subject. Dr. Mantik is working on a paper that he intends to publish, as well as a book. He has been selfless enough to spend many hours with me and allow me to present a skeleton preview of what his finished work will reveal. His publications will, of course, provide more complete and final results. What I am doing here is applying his discoveries in an effort to achieve a synthesis with the larger picture of medical, forensic, and photographic evidence. Optical Densitometry Please refer to Exhibits 14-1, 14-2, 14-3, and 14-4 at the end of this chapter. Also, the reader will find it helpful to study the other Exhibits, 14-5 through 14-8, in which the evidence of photographic forgery is included. The term “optical density” is a measure of the opaqueness of x-ray film. The higher the optical density the greater the opaqueness. Optical density, also called OD, is expressed as the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of incident light to transmitted light through the film. Clear portions of film have low optical density and dark portions have high optical density. In looking at an x-ray of the head, we are concerned with brain and bone tissue for the most part. On an x-ray positive print, which we are looking at here in the Kennedy x-rays, bone and brain tissue will appear as white or translucent, and absence of brain and bone tissue will appear as black. Therefore, strong white means much bone and/or brain tissue and very low optical density, and strong black means very high optical density and absence of bone and brain tissue. The mathematical definition of optical density is: OD = Log 10 (Io/I) where OD = Optical Density Io = Incident Light Intensity I = Transmitted Light Intensity The use of logarithms to express optical density tends to be confusing because, for example, a change of optical density from 1 to 2 is equivalent to a 10 to 1 change in actual transmission of light. (This is similar to the Richter Scale for earthquake intensity.) The normal working range of optical density in daily radiological practice is from about 0.5 to 2.0, seldom exceeding 3.0. An OD of 2.0 will appear quite dark on a positive print, and an OD of 0.5 will appear very white. Transmitted light intensity is calculated as follows: I ÷ Io = I0 - OD The table below shows transmissions calculated from the above for a range of optical densities: "},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"For a given tissue, the thicker it is, the greater the a ttenuation of the x-ray as it passes through the tissue. Attenuation may be thought of as a dampening of the intensity of the x-ray, therefore a lessening of its impact on the x-ray film.    Bone has a higher attenuation of x-ray transmission than brain tissue of an equal thickness. However, in the head, there is a much greater thickness of brain than bone except on the outer edges of the skull when visualizing it from one direction. This is illustrated in the diagram above. Visualize the head as a sphere of 3/8-inch thick bone [99] with a six-inch-diameter brain inside. [100] On the center line of the diagram, the brain tissue is therefore 16 times the thickness of one side of the skull bone, and it is 8 times the thickness of both sides of the skull. On the right and left side of the skull, however, the bone thickness through which the x-rays penetrate becomes much greater than the 3/8-inch thickness on the center line. From the foregoing, we can deduce that an x-ray positive print of a typical head would have a white ring around the periphery, with a center of varying shades of gray. Examination of Exhibit 14-3, which is an x-ray of Kennedy’s head while he was alive, shows this to be true. On the other hand, an empty skull with no defects in it would appear as a bright ring with a dark center approaching black. This is shown in part in Exhibit 14-1 which shows a dark area F with a bright periphery indicating an intact skull in that part of the skull, but virtually devoid of brain matter. As earlier noted, the dampening of x-ray transmission through a substance is measured as attenuation . For a given unit of thickness: Linear Attenuation Coefficients Fat Tissue (similar to brain) 80kV = 0.164 100kV = 0.154 Water"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"80kV = 0.183 100kV = 0.171 Bone 80kV = 0.344 100kV = 0.297 Note: kV is the voltage of the x-ray source. The ratio of attenuation of bone to brain as shown in the above table is 2.09:1 for a power source of 80kV, and 1.98:1 for 100 kV. Therefore it is relatively insensitive to the power source. For our purposes assume 2:1 for the attenuation ratio of bone compared to brain of equal thickness. Since the brain in the head at the center line of our diagram is eight times the thickness of two layers of bone, it would provide four times the attenuation of the bone. However, if one-half of the skull is missing, there is only one skull thickness that the x-ray is penetrating. In that case, the brain would provide eight times the attenuation of the bone. The point here is that when looking at an x-ray of the head, absence of bone is not readily detected by the human eye if one is looking at the film through the maximum thickness of the head. Also, when looking at the film at the right or left sides of the head in our diagram, the bone thickness becomes large relative to brain thickness because, in moving from the center to the side, there is a gradual decrease in attenuation attributable to brain, and an increase in attenuation attributable to bone, again making absence of bone not readily visible to the untrained eye. Only by using a sensitive instrument can reasonable, quantitative sense be made of x-rays, and the relative proportions of brain and bone tissue be estimated. That instrument is an “optical densitometer” which measures optical density in x-ray films, from which can be precisely calculated the light transmission through the developed film and, for a given film characteristic, correlated to authoritative standards of the related bone and brain tissue. This is widely used and is standard practice in radiation oncology, in which the nature and size of brain tissues and bone tissues have been observed and documented for a wide range of cases. This instrument can also be used to detect other objects in the brain such as bullets, which have an extremely high attenuation of x-ray transmission. In addition, the measurements can be used as a basis for calculation of approximate thickness of tissues or objects, or detection of one object superimposed on another object. Now I can get to my understanding of Dr. Mantik’s interpretation of the JFK x-ray films. First the question of the ease (or difficulty) of forging an x-ray film. There is a general misconception among the lay public and, curiously, among many medical doctors and even radiologists, that x-rays are sacrosanct; that they cannot be forged. [101] But Dr. Mantik has demonstrated that it is possible to forge an x-ray, at least one of 1963 vintage, if the objective is limited to concealing missing bone or brain tissues in one location. He has described this process at symposia and in his interim papers. In its simple form, all one needs is a light box, the original film, and unexposed film. Simply place a patch (or other materials of various opacities) on the unexposed film, then double- expose the original film onto this by use of a light box. The final product is the original with the patch added. [102] There is an alternative method to create a deceptive x-ray that Dr. Mantik has pointed out; that is to shield the body itself, in this case a portion of the head (let us say a hole in the head), and then to take the x-ray, which will not show the hole inasmuch as it has been shielded. At this point in Dr. Mantik’s research, he favors alteration of the x-rays as the method most likely used by the forgers. A variety of methods can be used to blend in the patch (or the shield) so that it is not readily detectable to the naked eye. But it is detectable by an optical densitometer unless the patch is done with"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"infinitely scrupulous care and precision-blending techniques, as will now be discussed. The Right Lateral X-Ray Unfortunately for the conspirators, it appears that they used a relatively crude method when producing the right lateral head x-ray in Exhibit 14-1. This was easily detectable by Dr. Mantik when he examined the original x-rays in the National Archives with an optical densitometer (the first time anyone had done so). He discovered a patch used by the conspirators that was so opaque that it had an attenuation nearly equivalent to a head of solid bone—and that he had never before seen in any other x-ray of human heads, or in the literature, or in measurements of x-rays of nineteen cadavers (and visual inspection of many others) from the 1960s and 1970s in coroner’s cases for death by gunshot to the head. Moreover, the ratio of the optical transmission (calculated from the optical density measurements) proved to be 1000:1 between the dark area F in Exhibit 14-1 compared to the white area F, whereas in clinical practice this ratio is seldom greater than 2:1 . This startling deviation indicates that a very opaque patch on area P had been used to produce the right lateral x-ray. In nine examples of coroner’s cases that Dr. Mantik first observed, the maximum ratio of light transmission from any dark to any light portion of the x-ray film was 3.89, with an average ratio of about 1.0. He later examined ten more cases with the same result. He also examined x-rays taken of the parietal bone (labeled PB) just behind the ear, in numerous skulls, and found that the optical density at that location was almost identical to the optical density in area P in Exhibit 14-1. Inasmuch as the parietal bone extends all the way across the head, it is equivalent to a head of solid bone, an impossibility for area P inasmuch as a head has brain in it in that area. The explanation for this is that the conspirators had overdone their patch work—it was much too dense! Clearly, Dr. Mantik had discovered that the right lateral x-ray of Kennedy’s head had been forged or otherwise produced in a crude attempt to conceal either missing bone or missing brain, or both, in that portion of the head. Curiously, however, the fact of missing brain or bone in area P is in fact observed in the anterior- posterior x-ray shown in Exhibit 14-2. This will now be discussed. The Anterior-Posterior (AP) X-Ray A great value of the AP x-ray in Exhibit 14-2 is that, except for one small anomaly, it is authentic. The portion that is not authentic is the bright circle labeled as “6.5mm object,” which appears to be a sliver of a bullet embedded in the outside of the skull on the back of the head. None of the autopsy pathologists at Bethesda, or others present, observed such an object, despite the fact that finding a bullet was one of their primary objectives. Dr. Mantik suspects that this object may have been artificially superimposed on a much smaller authentic metal fragment in a composite forgery after the original x-rays were developed. This was confirmed, in part, when Dr. Mantik interviewed Jerrol Custer, one of the x- ray technicians who was present at the autopsy. Custer told Mantik that the day after the autopsy, a skull was brought to him, strangely, and he was asked to x-ray it while placing a bullet on the skull. This indicated to Dr. Mantik that there was something very suspicious going on with regard to the x-rays. By comparing the AP x-ray with an autopsy photograph that is considered to be authentic, an important base can be established: The AP x-ray in Exhibit 14-2 is consistent with the head wound photo in Exhibit 14-4. In the previous chapter we established that the head wound photo is authentic, and that it"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"is consistent with the descriptions of the head wound by both Dr. Humes and Dr. Boswell at the autopsy, and that it is consistent with the description of the head wound described by Paul O’Connor. What we have here is an anchor point for our discussion: The AP x-ray, the autopsy photo of the head wound, and the testimony by key witnesses at the autopsy are all consistent. However, the lateral x-ray is inconsistent with these items, at least in area P where we find the patch. What is remarkable here is that Dr. Mantik’s analysis (albeit greatly simplified in this presentation) is in my opinion almost completely consistent with the fundamental discoveries of David Lifton and all the other evidence that I have presented in this book, including evidence of missing frames in the Zapruder film. My conclusion that frames are missing in the Zapruder film was thoroughly discussed in preceding chapters. It is based, in part, on the fact that at no frame in the film do we actually see a blow-out of bone and brains from the back of Kennedy’s head despite the fact that in frame 335 we do see the resultant flap of scalp after the blowout had occurred. Now we have the AP x-ray which also shows that a blow-out in the back of the head had taken place. This again is corroborating proof that frames were deleted in the Zapruder film to take out the eruption of brain and skull material that should have, must have, appeared at the rear of the head at the time of the fatal head shot, had not frames been deleted. An equally important corollary point is that if, in fact, the massive wound in the side and top of the head (as shown in Exhibit 14-4 and confirmed in the AP x-ray) actually did occur in Dealey Plaza, then many more frames must have been deleted from the Zapruder film—frames that would have shown the blow-out of brain and skull in the right side and top of the head. No such blow-out is present in any of the frames. The reason is obvious: Alteration of the Zapruder film to that extent would have been impracticable by removing frames, because it would have required that all of the frames after the fatal head shot be removed. [103] This would have created a major, uncorrectable, and obvious disturbance in the continuity of movement in the film. Therefore, my conclusion is that the large blowout of the side and top of the head that is shown in the autopsy photo in Exhibit 14-4 never occurred at Dealey Plaza. [104] Rather, it is the result of dissection of the head and removal of brain and skull material in a secret location, after the body left Dallas, as was first proposed by David Lifton. I have found no scenario of events other than David Lifton’s that so completely and consistently fits the cumulative evidence in the Zapruder film, the autopsy photographs, and the autopsy x-rays, combined with virtually all of the testimonies of the dozens of witnesses. The conclusion, even though many find it difficult to accept, is unavoidable: Kennedy’s body was secretly removed from Air Force One, taken to a secret location where the exit wound in the head was enlarged to obscure its nature and to remove incriminating bullet pathways and fragments, and a large portion of the brain was removed; and the body was then delivered to the Bethesda morgue. The ambulance that arrived at the front of the hospital contained the bronze casket, without Kennedy’s body in it. It is clear to me, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a massive attempt was made by persons in the federal government to alter the Zapruder film and the autopsy photos and x-rays, and to alter the president’s body, all done to conceal evidence of a conspiracy. The question is, why did they do such terrible things? There must have been a very powerful reason. * * * At this point in our narrative it is certainly reasonable to conclude that, based on the evidence: (a) President Kennedy was assassinated by a conspiratorial group of great power and ruthlessness, and (b) the crime was covered up by the executive branch of the U.S. government, starting within two hours after the assassination. The evidence is persuasive, convincing—indeed overwhelming—on both counts. What is not evident, however, is who planned the crime, who committed it, and—and most important of all—why did the U.S. government act so swiftly and massively to cover up this unprecedented assault on"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"the very foundation of our government? It seems, on its face, that such drastic cover-up measures would not have been committed unless those in the government who covered up the crime were part of the plot. By “those” I mean, most likely, Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover, who were in charge of the investigation. Without a doubt, Hoover’s FBI was guilty of concealing, destroying, and suppressing other prime evidence; and Johnson most certainly would have been aware of Hoover’s actions and the goings-on in the autopsy. However, if we are to remain objective, we must keep our minds open to the possibility that the cover-up by the U.S. government was carried out for some reason other than involvement of Hoover and Johnson in the assassination plot itself. In other words, the assassination and the cover-up could have been two distinct, unconnected operations, perhaps for national security reasons. My instincts rebel against that being true, but nonetheless I am compelled to maintain the thought while more evidence and analysis are developed in the chapters to follow. We will start by looking at a prime suspect, the Mafia."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Exhibit 14-1.

Source: National Archives Note: Very white area P indicating a composite forgery; very dark area F indicating almost complete void of brain behind intact right-front skull. This x-ray is considered by Dr. David Mantik to have been altered to conceal evidence of a blow-out of brain from the right hemisphere of the head through a hole in the rear of the skull. This was accomplished by either making a composite x-ray in which area P was masked to conceal the absence of brain or bone in that region, or by shielding that portion of the head when the x-ray was taken. Note the trail of white fragments across the top of the head. Dr. Mantik believes that these are bullet fragments resulting from a shot from the front entering the right lateral forehead at the hairline. See Exhibit 14-7 for the point of bullet entry in the right temple. The optical density in area P is nearly equivalent to a head of solid bone. To the contrary, the dark area in area F has optical density equivalent to air or close thereto, indicating an almost complete void in that region. Light transmission calculated from optical density measurements in area P and area F show an extremely abnormal ratio of P to F of about 1000:1, compared to what would normally be expected of no more than 2:1. This indicates that a patch has been added to area P to conceal missing brain or bone. [105] This x-ray in area P is inconsistent with the AP x-ray in Exhibit 14-2, and it is inconsistent with the autopsy photo in Exhibit 14-4. It is also inconsistent with the testimonies of the doctors at Bethesda and Parkland Hospitals and the testimony of Paul O’Connor. "},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Exhibit 14-2.

This x-ray is considered by Dr. David Mantik to be authentic except for a 6.5mm sliver of what appears to be lead embedded on the outside of the skull in the back of the head. With this one exception it is consistent with the testimonies of Drs. Humes and Boswell, in which they describe the head wound, and it is consistent with the testimony of Paul O’Connor in which he described a large amount of missing brain when the body arrived at Bethesda. However it is not consistent with area P in the lateral x-ray in Exhibit 14-1 in that it does not show abnormal ratios of optical density from dark to light areas. But it is consistent with the lateral x-ray in that it shows large portions of missing brain in the right upper hemisphere, down to at least the surface of the cerebellum, and also shows large portions of missing brain in the left upper hemisphere. An important aspect of this x-ray is that, with the one exception of the bullet sliver, it is consistent with the large defect in the head shown in the autopsy photo in Exhibit 14-4. (The above x-ray is a front view of the head taken at an upward angle of 20 to 25°; the autopsy photo in Exhibit 14-4 is a view of the top and rear of the skull.) Using optical density measurement from both the lateral and AP x-rays, Dr. Mantik estimates that the right side has very little brain remaining, and the left side appears to have about 60 to 65% remaining, resulting in a composite estimate very close to that observed by Paul O’Connor, who said that only about 25% of the total brain remained when the president’s body arrived at Bethesda Naval Hospital.

It is an autopsy photo that most certainly is a deception. Floyd Reibe, a photographic technician who took the pictures of the body at Bethesda, said in a television interview on KRON TV in San Francisco, “The President had a big gaping hole in the back of the head.” With regard to the above photo, Reibe said, “It’s being phonied someplace; it’s make believe.” It has never been conclusively established how this photograph could have been produced or where it was taken—it is obviously a deception of some sort. A possible explanation is that there is a hair piece being held in place to cover up the 2 1 D2 inch to 3 inch wound, with some airbrushing on the portion above the hairline. This photograph was taken before the reconstruction of the head by the undertaker, because the “bat wing” shaped flap above the ear is still intact.

One possible answer to this conflict is that there were, in fact, two photo sessions, the first taken at an interim secret location where the photo in Exhibit 14-5 was made before the skull opening was enlarged and the brain partially removed by the conspirators.

Dr. Mantik told me that this is the best evidence he has seen that the body was altered before it arrived at the Bethesda morgue. This photo is evidence that the wound was enlarged, or the photo painted over, to give the appearance of an exit wound. Note the dark spot located by the arrow.

Tyler, Organized Crime in America Meskil, Luparelli Tape Cited in HSCA Report: Appendix 15 THE MAFIA AND THE DALLAS POLICE In this chapter evidence will be examined that implicates certain Mafia chieftains in the Kennedy assassination. At the same time we will look at the role of the Dallas police as likely co-conspirators, and at the motivation of certain Mafia chieftains to reach the momentous decision to join in a conspiracy to assassinate the president of the United States. Our premise here is that their motivation was primarily a matter of their personal survival, but mixed with no small amount of anger and desire for revenge against the Kennedys. Before delving into the details it will be useful to first ask ourselves the question whether or not it would have been feasible for the Mafia, acting within its own organizational capacity, to mastermind, execute, and cover up the assassination, in light of the evidence presented in previous chapters. The answer is certainly a resounding no! This becomes apparent when we consider the criminal acts perpetrated in the cover-up: altering the Zapruder film, stealing and altering the president’s body, forging the x-rays, faking the autopsy report, and so on. The Mafia obviously could not have accomplished these things unless it had accomplices who were high government officials with enormous cunning and sufficient power to see that cover-ups of such a complex plot would be accomplished inside the executive branch of the U.S. government. As the reader is by now aware, a thesis of this book is that these accomplices were, at a minimum, Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover. Whether or not these two were blackmailed into the cover-up, or pragmatically took advantage of the terrible event, or were willing participants in the initial plot itself, remains to be seen as we progress. One of the surprising revelations that I encountered in researching this book is the large number of dedicated conspiracy researchers who strongly believe that the Mafia had nothing at all to do with the Kennedy assassination. They cite the argument, just noted, that the Mafia simply did not have the capability to execute and sustain the cover-up. They also point out that the Mafia did not have the sophistication to conduct the disinformation scheme of setting up Oswald as a Communist connected with Cuba and the Soviet Union. These points may be well taken but, as will be argued, they do not take into account the Mafia’s capability to influence powerful “legitimate” interests, including not only the vice president of the United States and the director of the FBI, but also the CIA and wealthy right-wing extremists and business interests. Taking the foregoing into account, I decided that I should first examine the basic evidence for Mafia complicity before going into the broader evidence related to its penetration of world-wide “legitimate” power structures. I began with specific evidence that certain Mafia chieftains felt, justifiably, that their power and the existence of their organizations were being threatened by the Kennedys, as was their fear of imminent incarceration in a federal penitentiary. Motives of the Mafia to Assassinate John Kennedy When John Kennedy assumed the office of the presidency in 1961, Robert Kennedy immediately"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"launched an unprecedented program against organized crime in the United States. By all documented evidence available, this amounted to no less than a crusade to do away with the Mafia, specifically Sam Giancana, Carlos Marcello, Santo Trafficante, Jr., and their financier and cohort, Jimmy Hoffa. Acting on the demands of his father, President Kennedy had appointed his thirty-five-year-old brother as attorney general. That must have been an unmistakable signal to the mob that the Kennedys, as a family, were out to get them. Sam Giancana and Jimmy Hoffa had experienced their fill of Robert Kennedy when he was counsel to the McClelland Committee and had personally attacked and humiliated both of them on national television. (Robert Kennedy once sneeringly taunted Giancana, referring to him as a “little girl” when Giancana took the Fifth Amendment rather than answering Kennedy’s questions.) The House Select Committee on Assassinations did a thorough job of investigating the Mafia. Granted, it stopped short when evidence began to develop that connected the mob with LBJ, Hoover, and the CIA. But what the committee did do, it did well. In this chapter I will draw primarily on the HSCA Report, as well as on the works of David Scheim, Robert Blakey, and John Davis in developing the basic data and evidence. Exhibit 15-1 includes graphical plots of the buildup of Justice Department activity against organized crime after the Kennedys took office. As a result of this buildup from 1961 to 1963, there was a 500 percent increase in defendants indicted—from 121 to 615—and a 400 percent increase in defendants convicted—from 73 to 288. There was a 250 percent increase in the number of attorneys—from 17 to 60. And there was more than a 900 percent increase in days in the field. There was a 1,250 percent increase in days in grand jury—from 100 to 1353. And there was a 1,700 percent increase in days in court—from 61 to 1,081. Exhibit 15-1. Robert Kennedy’s Program Against Organized Crime. The above chart illustrates the dramatic increase of activity in the Department of Justice against the Mafia that took place during the Kennedy administration. Between 1960 and 1963, there was: (1) a 250% increase in the number of attorneys—from 17 to 60; (2) more than a 900% increase in days in the field—from 660 to 6,172; (3) a 1,250% increase in days in grand jury—from 100 to 1,353; (4) a 1,700% increase in days in court—from 61 to 1,081. These figures plummeted when Robert Kennedy was stripped of power by Lyndon Johnson, and"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"J. Edgar Hoover was again given full reign. Source: HSCA Volume IX , pp. 20-21 Of particular significance, as illustrated in these graphs, is the rapid fall-off of activity against organized crime after the assassination at the end of 1963. If the Mafia’s objective in murdering the president was to get Robert Kennedy off their backs, they seem to have succeeded. How could the Kennedy brothers have been so naive as to fail to realize that they were on a collision course with the Mafia? The Kennedy brothers may have been intellectually brilliant but they were surely deficient in emotional intelligence. After all, they were very young and came from a sheltered background and had very little of life’s experience outside the lawns and clubs of New England, Washington, D.C., and the Court of St. James. It appears that they did, indeed, deliberately pursue parallel paths of using the mob for favors (political and sexual) while trying to destroy it. It could be that the brothers just did not realize that this was dangerous in the extreme. The obviousness of this becomes even more evident when we consider that Robert Kennedy learned no later than May 1962 that the mob was being used by his own personally directed operations in the CIA for plots to assassinate Fidel Castro, thus gravely compromising the U.S. government and the Kennedys themselves. [106] Yet Robert Kennedy continued his vendetta against the Mafia, unabated. Whether or not he ordered that the arrangement between the CIA and the Mafia be stopped is uncertain. Of course, the foregoing material, in and of itself, is not proof of Mafia complicity in the conspiracy, but it is a building block; it shows motive. We can now go to another building block: Jack Ruby’s murder of Oswald. Jack Ruby’s Connections with Organized Crime The conspirators’ cover was blown when Jack Ruby shot Oswald while he was in the middle of a circle of dozens of Dallas policemen. The plotters must have been in a state of high anxiety to go to such desperate measures. Of all the incidents that triggered suspicion of a conspiracy involving the Dallas police, in the minds of the American people, Ruby’s shooting of Oswald stands foremost. It has now been concluded, with the exception of a few remaining defenders of the Warren Commission Report, that Oswald was shot to silence him because he had enough information to unravel the conspiracy. G. Robert Blakey, chief counsel of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, reached that conclusion. The original plan of the conspirators, it would appear, was to have Oswald killed when leaving the scene, or later after flying him out of the country, and to pin the crime on him as a Communist and an agent of Cuba. For reasons not fully understood, the plan went awry and Oswald was captured, unharmed, by the Dallas police. This was one of several things that went wrong in the master plan. Jack Ruby at first claimed to have shot Oswald out of sympathy for Jacqueline Kennedy and her children. But in its report, the HSCA provided evidence to the contrary: The committee also questioned Ruby’s self-professed motive for killing Oswald, his story to the Warren Commission and other authorities that he did it out of sorrow over the assassination and sympathy for the president’s widow and children. Ruby consistently claimed there had been no other motive and that no one had influenced his act. A handwritten note by Ruby, disclosed in 1967, however, exposed Ruby’s explanation for the Oswald slaying as a fabricated legal ploy. Addressed to his attorney, Joseph Tonahill, it told of advice Ruby had received from his first lawyer, Tom Howard, in 1963: “Joe, you should know this. Tom Howard told me to say that I shot Oswald so that Caroline and Mrs. Kennedy wouldn’t have to come to Dallas to testify. OK?” [107]"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" Tom Howard was an attorney who was Mafia-connected and had visited Ruby in jail less than three hours after Ruby shot Oswald. Robert Blakey wrote about this incident: Tonahill later said, “What Ruby wrote down disturbed me very much. I thought about it, walking all the way back to my hotel room. It was very upsetting.” Belli himself wrote in Dallas Justice : Clearly [Ruby’s]...story of trying to protect Mrs. Kennedy from a harrowing court appearance at a trial for Oswald did not add up.... I am sure the story was false because it didn’t square with everything else we knew.... [108] With the above-written confession of Jack Ruby—that his story of why he killed Oswald was a lie—it would seem to be enough to convince a jury of his participation in a conspiracy. But we need to go further in examining the evidence that the Mafia was deeply involved in the Kennedy conspiracy. The starting point is Jack Ruby’s contacts with the Mafia in the months preceding the assassination, and in the aftermath of his shooting Oswald. Exploring these activities reveals Ruby to have been in the center of a far-flung network involving direct links to Mafia operators connected with Sam Giancana, Carlos Marcello, Santo Trafficante, Jr., and Jimmy Hoffa, with further links to the Dallas police, Oswald, and the CIA. The heart of the evidence is in telephone records of incoming and outgoing calls from Ruby’s night club (the Carousel) from April through November 1963. Exhibit 15-2 illustrates these calls with Jack Ruby as the hub of a network branching out to major underworld figures throughout the United States. These gangsters were the head bosses covering the entire United States. Giancana covered everything west of the Mississippi including Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Dallas. Carlos Marcello had his own fiefdom in New Orleans which overlapped Giancana’s territory into Dallas. Trafficante covered the southeastern United States, headquartered in Florida. Frank Costello covered the northeastern United States, headquartered in New York.

There are smaller gaps in his Carousel toll call records for the periods January 1-16 and March 2-April 9, 1963. Note the buildup of out-of-state calls starting in May 1963, after the announcement that John Kennedy was going to visit Dallas. Source: Scheim, Contract on America (with minor corrections by this author), and from author’s analysis of Warren Report documents This evidence strongly suggests that a major conspiracy was underway with Jack Ruby in the thick of it in Dallas. It demolishes the lie bought by the Warren Commission that Jack Ruby was not meaningfully connected with organized crime. Telephone calls of particular significance are those between Nofio Pecora and Jack Ruby. One of the telephone calls was from Pecora to Ruby on August 4 with a return call from Ruby on October 30. This call linked Ruby, through Pecora, to Oswald. You may recall that Oswald was thrown in jail in New Orleans for getting into a scuffle with anti-Castro Cubans while Oswald was distributing pro-Castro literature. The records show that he was assisted in getting out of jail by Emile Bruneau, who paid a small fine on Oswald’s behalf. It was discovered years later by the HSCA that Bruneau had been closely associated with Nofio Pecora, who was one of two major associates of Carlos Marcello. And it is Pecora’s name that showed up as having placed a telephone call on August 4, 1963 to Jack Ruby from the number in New Orleans of Pecora’s office phone in the Tropical Court trailer park, of which Pecora was the manager. Pecora had received a telephone call from Carlos Marcello on June 24, 1963 at the very same telephone at Tropical Court from which Pecora called Ruby five weeks later. This exchange of calls fits into the intense pattern of calls between Ruby and Mafia figures that occurred between April 23 and November 9, 1963. The director of the New Orleans Metropolitan Crime Commission, Aaron Kohn, described Pecora as an “ex convict with extensive past history in the heroin traffic,” and a partner of Carlos Marcello. [109] Another very interesting exchange of telephone calls was between Ruby and Al Gruber (an associate of Sam Giancana) on November 17, and again on November 22, three hours after Kennedy was shot! An FBI report, omitted from the Warren Commission Report and withheld even from National Archives files until 1970, summarizes Gruber’s police record of six arrests under two aliases in Illinois, Indiana, and"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"California, with a conviction for grand larceny. Al Gruber was a friend of Ruby’s from Chicago where they had roomed together for a year. In mid-November 1963, after a ten-year separation, Gruber paid an extended visit to Ruby in Dallas. [110] In addition to the above contacts, other organized crime figures appearing in Ruby’s network of telephone calls reveal the depth and extent of his contacts with the Mafia. I have abstracted and condensed the following from Scheim’s authoritative work, Contract on America, and, except for Sheim’s original research, reconfirmed it in HSCA documents: Barney Baker, a close associate of Jimmy Hoffa, functioned in the Teamsters as “a versatile labor goon,” or as Robert Kennedy phrased it, one of Hoffa’s “roving emissaries of violence.” The FBI identified him as “a reported muscle and bagman for Teamsters president James Hoffa.” And the HSCA described him as a “hoodlum with organized crime and Teamsters connections.” Baker maintained close and frequent contacts with notorious mobsters throughout the country. The name “Barney,” with three of Baker’s phone numbers, was found in one of Ruby’s notebooks. [111] Frank Caracci was identified in a 1970 Judiciary Committee hearing as a “Cosa Nostra involved” gambler and strip joint operator. Life magazine described him as a “Marcello mobster,” and the Wall Street Journal reported that he was “closely affiliated” with Carlos Marcello. [112] Joseph Glaser’s syndicate connection was confirmed in a New York Times series on Los Angeles attorney and mobster Sidney Korshak. Describing Korshak as “the most important link between organized crime and big business,” the Times related that senior Justice Department officials ranked him among “the most powerful members of the underworld.” Glaser’s underworld clout was suggested by one incident in 1961, in which Jimmy Hoffa was displaced from the best suite in the Las Vegas Riviera Hotel to accommodate Glaser. On August 5, 1963, Jack Ruby visited Joseph Glaser in New York City. Ruby placed two calls to Glaser ten days later. [113] Russell D. Matthews was described in one FBI report as a burglar, armed robber, narcotics pusher, and murderer. He worked for mob-controlled (Santo Trafficante) Cuban casinos in the latter 1950s and turned to Dallas underworld pursuits in the 1960s. The Dallas Morning News reported that “Matthews was arrested more than 50 times by Dallas-area law authorities but served time in prison only once—two years on a federal narcotics violation.” In January 1974, Matthews was subpoenaed by a federal grand jury in Houston concerning a reported contract to kill informants of corruption in the Houston Police Narcotics Division. Matthews was an associate of Trafficante and the Campisis. Four witnesses described Matthews as an associate or friend of Ruby. On October 3, 1963, a call was placed from the Carousel Club to a number in Shreveport, Louisiana, listed to Elizabeth Matthews, Russell’s former wife. [114] Lewis J. McWillie, described by Dallas police as a “gambler and murderer,” served the Syndicate in several domains. From September 1958 until May 1960, McWillie was manager of the mob-owned Tropicana Hotel in Havana; the hotel’s other top men included mobsters Giuseppe Cotrini, John Guglielmo, Norman Rothman, Willie Bischoff, and Meyer and Jake Lansky. McWillie was finally forced out of Cuba in January 1961, along with the rest of the mob, with most of his assets confiscated. Ruby, McWillie, and others reported that the two were close friends. Their close association was exhibited during a week-long trip to Havana by Ruby in 1959, during which he saw McWillie frequently. Moreover, Ruby reported he once had four guns shipped to McWillie in Cuba. And on May 19, 1963, according to sales records confirmed by McWillie, Ruby had a revolver shipped"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"from Ray’s Hardware Store in Dallas to McWillie in Las Vegas. Over the following four months, Ruby called McWillie eight times at the Thunderbird in Las Vegas. [115] Murray W. “Dusty” Miller was the head of the Southern Conference of Teamsters in 1963 and later became secretary treasurer of the Teamsters International. The House Assassinations Committee reported that Miller “was associated with numerous underworld figures.” On November 8, 1963, Ruby called Miller person-to-person at the Eden Roc Hotel in Miami. [116] Irwin S. Weiner, a Chicago bail bondsman with no felony record, was also one of the mob’s leading front men in Chicago, “thought to be the underworld’s major financial figure in the mid- west.” “A comprehensive list of his associates,” the House Assassinations Committee noted, “would include a significant number of the major organized crime figures in the United States. Among them have been Jimmy Hoffa, Santo Trafficante and Sam Giancana.” Like many of Ruby’s other mob contacts, and like Ruby himself, Weiner had been involved in the mob’s Cuban operations. Weiner was also active in the Teamsters, as demonstrated by his frequent mention in FBI files with Jimmy Hoffa and union bigwig Allen Dorfman. (Weiner was with Dorfman when Dorfman was shot to death in a 1983 gangland-style execution in Chicago.) On October 26, 1963, Ruby placed a twelve-minute call from the Carousel Club, person-to- person, to Weiner in Chicago. When questioned by the FBI three days after Ruby shot Oswald, Weiner refused to provide any information about this call. He subsequently furnished a series of contradictory explanations. [117] David Yaras was included in a U.S. Senate list of Chicago Mafia non-member associates, characterized by an activity code indicating “extortion, mayhem and murder.” Arrested fourteen times, Yaras is described in Captive City as “a prime suspect in several gangland slayings”—one of “more than a score of top-rated exterminators who work strictly on contracts for the board of directors.” Yaras was one of a group of mobsters monitored by an FBI bug in 1962 while planning a murder contract in Miami and discussing previous killings. The bug provided grisly transcripts detailing mob executions, later published by Life magazine, and saved the life of the intended victim. Yaras served as a go-between for Carlos Marcello and Santo Trafficante. Yaras was also a crony of Jimmy Hoffa. Like Marcello, Trafficante, Hoffa, and Ruby, Yaras had engaged in mob operations in Cuba. And the House Assassinations Committee reported that “Yaras has served, it is alleged, as a key lieutenant of Chicago Mafia leader Sam Giancana.” Yaras told the FBI that he knew Ruby for about fifteen years in Chicago, and related enough details about Ruby’s habits and personality to indicate more than a remote acquaintance. Although Yaras had no recorded contacts with Ruby in 1963, a curious indirect link brings us full circle among Ruby’s associates. Note in Exhibit 15-1 that on November 7 and 8, 1963, Jack Ruby exchanged calls with teamster thug Barney Baker. Two weeks later on November 21, 1963, at 6:17 p.m., the night before the assassination, a three-minute call was placed from the home phone of Baker in Chicago to a “Dave” in Miami, Florida. The “Dave” who was called person-to-person by Baker, as identified by telephone records, was Ruby’s old friend, syndicate killer Dave Yaras. [118] Frank Goldstein in San Francisco confirmed a ten-minute call person-to-person placed by Ruby on November 12. Goldstein descr ibes himself as a “professional gambler.” [119] These telephone calls and contacts are by no means the only ones. Ruby is known to have placed calls from pay telephones (a common practice in mob communication). Many of the calls in Exhibit 15-1 may"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"have been simply to tip off the recipient that Ruby would be placing a call from a pay phone later. In addition to the telephone calls, records show that Ruby traveled to New Orleans in mid-May 1963, and traveled to New York and Chicago on August 5, 1963. Also, Ruby is reported to have met with Johnny Rosselli, Sam Giancana’s man in Los Angeles and Las Vegas, at two small motels in Miami sometime in October 1963. [120] It was during this same period that Ruby again traveled to New Orleans, between October 1 and October 15. Johnny Rosselli, Mafia hit man graduated to a top Mafioso operative, was Sam Giancana’s right-hand man in the plans of the CIA to assassinate Fidel Castro. Rosselli was closely linked to Santo Trafficante. He became a close friend and drinking buddy with William Harvey, the man in charge of ZR/RIFLE, the CIA program to assassinate foreign leaders. Rosselli had met with Harvey at his home in Washington, D.C., [121] in June 1963. Years later, Rosselli would start talking and reveal to columnist Jack Anderson that Ruby was “one of our boys and had been ordered to kill Oswald.” Shortly after testifying to the Senate’s Church Committee, Rosselli was murdered in the late summer of 1976; his body was found cut into pieces and stuffed in an oil drum that floated to the surface in a Florida intercostal waterway. Recapping at this point, we are building a very powerful body of circumstantial evidence that links the Mafia to the JFK assassination and shows that Jack Ruby was a Mafia operative. We also have a very strong case that Ruby’s silencing of Oswald was not, as he initially claimed, done out of impulse and emotion for Jacqueline and Caroline Kennedy, but was ordered by someone, probably the mob, to prevent Oswald from testifying because Oswald would have blown the case wide open. Common sense tells us that the conspirators did not plan to have Oswald executed on national television. It appears that things went terribly wrong and Ruby was ordered to correct the mistake. We will now examine evidence linking New Orleans’ Mafia chieftain Carlos Marcello to Lee Harvey Oswald, David Ferrie, Clay Shaw, and the CIA.

The incident was investigated thoroughly by the HSCA. Robert Blakey, chief legal counsel of the HSCA, summarized the scene in which the threat took place: Marcello’s anger could have constituted a motive for the assassination. There was a witness, moreover, who said the New Orleans Mafia leader had been quite specific about the manner and method of his revenge. Edward Becker, a former Las Vegas promoter who had lived on the fringe of the underworld, told of a meeting in September 1962 at Churchill Farms at which Marcello became enraged at the mention of Robert Kennedy’s name. ”Don’t worry about that little Bobby son-of-a- bitch,” Becker reported Marcello said. “He’s going to be taken care of.” Then he muttered a Sicilian curse: “ Livarsi na petra di la scarpa.” (“Take the stone out of my shoe.”) Becker said Marcello had even devised a plan: he would use a “nut” to do the job, someone who could be manipulated, for it was important that his own people not be identified as the assassins. Marcello then offered a metaphor. The President was the dog, the Attorney General Kennedy was its tail. If you cut off the tail, the dog will keep biting; but if you chop off the head, the dog will die, tail and all. [122] The reliability of Edward Becker as a witness was confirmed by the HSCA when it talked to Julian Blodgett, a former FBI agent and chief investigator in the Los Angeles district attorney’s office. Blodgett had employed Becker on occasion in 1962; he said that he believed Becker’s account. The HSCA reported that it also was able to “...obtain substantial corroboration for Becker’s presence in the New Orleans area in September 1962....” [123] When Carlos Marcello appeared before the HSCA on January 11, 1978, he was questioned about this account and denied that it happened. The HSCA severely criticized the FBI for trying to discredit Becker’s story and for failing to investigate leads that would have confirmed it. There are numerous other links of Marcello to the Kennedy assassination, the most important of which is his association with David Ferrie, and both Marcello’s and Ferrie’s connections to Oswald. Ferrie was brought to public attention by Jim Garrison in his celebrated case in 1967; but three days after Ferrie’s name became public, he was found dead of an alleged cerebral hemorrhage, induced by an overdose of drugs. Ferrie is one of many potential witnesses who would die mysteriously. Among them was Eladio del Valle, who was murdered in Miami within a day or two after Ferrie’s death. Del Valle was a radical anti-Castro Cuban. (According to ex-Cuban Intelligence officers in a meeting in Nassau that I attended in 1995, Del Valle was part of the assassination team that killed President Kennedy. More on that later.) Marcello’s connections to David Ferrie are extensive and well documented. Ferrie worked for Marcello as a pilot and worked for Marcello’s attorney, G. Wray Gill, as a research assistant. Marcello also was listed as a sponsor for a service station that Ferrie operated in 1964. David Ferrie, a rabid anti-Communist and a homosexual with a penchant for boys, was associated with the Cuban Revolutionary Council (an anti-Castro organization) and with Guy Banister, a private detective, ex-FBI agent, and reputed high leader in the ultra-right Minutemen. Ferrie was also associated with Clay Shaw, a New Orleans businessman who was a homosexual, a CIA operative, and connected with worldwide, extreme right-wing organizations, among which was Permindex, allegedly a CIA company in Italy. Ferrie was a frequent associate of Oswald, having been seen with him around New Orleans many times by numerous witnesses. Also, Oswald was a former cadet in the Louisiana Civil Air Patrol commanded by Ferrie. Two photographs have recently been discovered showing the two together. Ferrie hated President Kennedy. He is quoted as saying, “He ought to be shot.” He said, “Anyone could hide in the bushes and shoot the president.” Like Clay Shaw, Ferrie was a contract agent for the"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"CIA. His role in the CIA was confirmed in 1975, when Victor Marchetti, former executive assistant to the CIA deputy director, stated that during high-level CIA meetings in 1969, CIA director Richard Helms revealed that Ferrie and other figures in the Garrison investigation, including Clay Shaw, had indeed worked for the agency. [124] Oswald’s connections to Marcello include the fact that Oswald’s surrogate father and uncle, Charles (Dutz) Merret, was a Marcello lieutenant. Also, according to an FBI informer (Code SV-T-1), sometime in April 1963, Oswald received money from a man who was later discovered to be a top lieutenant of Carlos Marcello—Joe Poretto—in the Town and Country restaurant managed by Anthony Marcello, Carlos’s brother. And according to FBI informant Eugene De Lapara, Anthony Marcello had recently remarked in nearby Tregles Bar, “The word is out to get the Kennedy family.” The FBI questioned Anthony Marcello shortly after the assassination but then quickly dropped the inquiry. When Oswald was thrown in jail in New Orleans for his fight with anti-Castro Cubans while handing out pro-Castro leaflets, some of the leaflets had 544 Camp Street (an address wholly associated with anti- Castro groups) stamped on them. It was also the address of Guy Banister’s office and was next door to the office of Jim Braden, a Mafia operative who was arrested in Dealey Plaza immediately after the JFK assassination, but immediately let go. One of the questions raised about Jim Garrison is why he never made a serious Mafia connection to the Kennedy assassination. [125] He came at it from the other direction: He first targeted David Ferrie, then developed evidence of Ferrie’s connections to Oswald, Banister, and Clay Shaw, then to the CIA. But one might reasonably make the connections flow from Marcello back through Ferrie to the same characters, to the CIA. Garrison certainly knew about Carlos Marcello, who was the biggest mobster in New Orleans. Some suspect that Garrison was blind to the Mafia connection because he had been compromised by them. Others suspect that Garrison was a shill for the mob and that his entire investigation was a ruse to direct attention to the CIA and away from Marcello. Among the many Garrison detractors are writers and researchers who look at him as a sham and repudiate everything he did or said. To his detractors I suggest that of all the investigative work done in the JFK assassination, few have withstood the test of time as well as Jim Garrison’s, although he was strangely silent on the Mafia. A central part of Garrison’s case was a visit by Oswald, Ferrie, and Shaw to Clinton, Louisiana, in August-September 1963. The HSCA thoroughly investigated that incident and summarized it in its report: Oswald in Clinton, La .—While reports of some Oswald contacts with anti-Castro Cubans were known at the time of the 1964 investigation, allegations of additional Cuba-related associations surfaced in subsequent years. As an example, Oswald reportedly appeared in August-September 1963 in Clinton, La., where a voting rights demonstration was in progress. The reports of Oswald in Clinton were not, as far as the committee could determine, available to the Warren Commission, although one witness said he notified the FBI when he recognized Oswald from news photographs right after the assassination. In fact, the Clinton sightings did not publicly surface until 1967, when they were introduced as evidence in the assassination investigation being conducted by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison. In that investigation, one suspect, David W. Ferrie, a staunch anti- Castro partisan, died within days of having been named by Garrison; the other, Clay L. Shaw, was acquitted in 1969. Aware that Garrison had been fairly criticized for questionable tactics, the committee proceeded cautiously, making sure to determine on its own the credibility of information coming from his probe. The committee found that the Clinton witnesses were credible and significant . They each were interviewed or deposed, or appeared before the committee in executive"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"session. While there were points that could be raised to call into question their credibility, it was the judgment of the committee that they were telling the truth as they knew it. There were six Clinton witnesses, among them a State representative, a deputy sheriff and a registrar of voters. By synthesizing the testimony of all of them, since they each contributed to the overall account, the committee was able to piece together the following sequence of events. Clinton, La., about 130 miles from New Orleans, is the county seat of East Feliciana Parish. In the late summer of 1963 it was targeted by the Congress of Racial Equality for a voting rights campaign. Oswald first showed up in nearby Jackson, La., seeking employment at East Louisiana State Hospital, a mental institution. Apparently on advice that his job would depend on his becoming a registered voter, Oswald went to Clinton for that purpose (although the committee could find no record that he was successful). In addition to the physical descriptions they gave that matched that of Oswald, other observations of the witnesses tended to substantiate their belief that he was, in fact, the man they saw. For example, he referred to himself as ‘Oswald,’ and he produced his Marine Corps discharge papers as identification. Some of the witnesses said that Oswald was accompanied by two older men whom they identified as Ferrie and Shaw. If the witnesses were not only truthful but accurate as well in their accounts, they established an association of an undetermined nature between Ferrie, Shaw and Oswald less than 3 months before the assassination. [126] (Emphasis added) Evidence of associations between Oswald, Ferrie, Shaw, and Banister that have been reported over the years have developed into an iron-clad case. In a 1994 conference in Washington, D.C., [127] James DiEugenio, author of Destiny Betrayed and specialist on Jim Garrison and the New Orleans evidence, presented extensive documentation that he has recently developed of the trip (just noted) by Oswald, Ferrie, and Shaw to help Oswald get a job in a state mental hospital in Jackson, Louisiana. This trip was a very strange event, corroborated by forty-five witnesses. The state mental hospital in Jackson is now suspected of having been involved with the CIA in its mind-control research with the code name MK/ULTRA. In addition to David Ferrie, Carlos Marcello had contacts with the CIA that could have provided him with the expertise to plan and carry out the Oswald impersonation schemes previously noted. First of all, Marcello was involved and played a role in the 19611963 CIA/Mafia plots to assassinate Fidel Castro. He admitted this to FBI undercover operative Joseph Hauser in 1979. Second, Marcello had a close friend in Washington, a lobbyist by the name of Irving Davidson, who served as an unofficial lobbyist for the CIA on Capitol Hill. Davidson had contacts with almost anyone in the CIA, and with J. Edgar Hoover. And Davidson had business relationships with Clint Murchison in Dallas (one example: as a go-between for a cash pay-off from Murchison to Bobby Baker, LBJ’s protegée), and could easily have put Carlos Marcello or his operatives in touch with any or all of these people. [128] It is possible, and should be considered seriously, that David Ferrie himself could have cooked up the scheme to provide an Oswald impersonator to go around Dallas, as in the rifle range and the Mercury- Lincoln dealership incidents. Ferrie could also, working with other CIA operatives, plausibly have sent Oswald or an impersonator to Mexico City to make contact with the Soviet and Cuban embassies there in order to implicate Oswald as appearing to be plotting some sinister activities with the Communists. One might conclude that Carlos Marcello—working with the mad genius David Ferrie, other CIA-linked rogues, and Mafia minion Jack Ruby—could have singlehandedly been the mastermind behind the conspiracy. Marcello’s associates in Dallas could plausibly have worked with right-wing businessmen and the Dallas police to control events there. But what about the forgeries of the Zapruder film and the autopsy x-rays, which certainly required"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"high-level cooperation—extremely dangerous and frantic cooperation—in Washington, D.C.? Could Marcello have arranged that? I would say that it is not likely that such extreme steps would be planned before the fact; but plausible if done after the fact when Oswald was captured, throwing everything into a cocked hat. In other words, it seems impossible that Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover would have agreed to the forgeries of the Zapruder film and the autopsy x-rays unless forced to do so by a botched plot of which they were a part. David Ferrie did have a reputation for being a schemer and a plotter. He was sometimes known as “the professor,” or “the master of intrigue,” by his associates in the anti-Castro movement. Ferrie had strong organizational abilities; he organized the New Orleans Civil Air Patrol into a highly respected unit. He, like Marcello, had an ability to influence others to do his bidding. Ferrie practiced hypnosis (he had an extensive library on hypnosis in his apartment—and there is some indication of his involvement in MK/ ULTRA), and both Ferrie and Marcello were right-wing extremists and militant segregationists. Both worked hard on behalf of the Cuban exiles. Adding to the suspicion that Ferrie’s and Marcello’s dual activities connect them directly to the plot in Dallas is a meeting between Ferrie and Marcello at Churchill Farms (Marcello’s 6,000-acre estate in the Louisiana bayou) on the weekend of November 9-10, and again on the weekend of November 16-17. What were they doing in the last two weekends before President Kennedy was murdered? Was it at these meetings that an evil crime boss and his diabolical professor pulled the strings as the JFK assassination went down? Or was there a higher cabal, with Marcello and Ferrie only merely players? Ferrie’s Activities after the Assassination [129] On November 22, at the very moment of the assassination, a trial was underway in New Orleans in which Robert Kennedy’s Department of Justice was attempting to deport Carlos Marcello. Marcello won the case. Present at the trial, a very important event indeed, were Carlos Marcello, his family, and David Ferrie. David Ferrie’s boss, Carlos Marcello, had just dealt a devastating legal blow to Robert Kennedy’s Justice Department. And President Kennedy, of whom Ferrie had made public statements outlining a cross-fire plot of how Kennedy should be assassinated, had now been assassinated in Dallas. And now, Lee Harvey Oswald, Ferrie’s friend, had been captured by the Dallas police and accused of the crime. What a calamity this must have seemed to David Ferrie and Carlos Marcello. That very evening, Ferrie took off in his car with two young male companions and headed for Houston, Texas, driving through a thunderstorm and arriving in Houston at 4 a.m. on November 23. The route of this fascinating trip and the timing of events is shown in Exhibit 15-4. It bears close examination. Exhibit 15-4. David Ferrie’s Trip after the assassination."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Ferrie later said that the reason for this trip was to go ice skating in Houston with his young companions. Before Ferrie and his companions left New Orleans, Ferrie had placed a telephone call to a motel in Houston that was owned by Carlos Marcello and made a reservation for the night. After that, he telephoned the owner of the Winterland Skating Rink in Houston and asked about the skating schedule. Sometime during the afternoon of the next day, Saturday, November 23, Ferrie placed a collect call to the Town and Country Motel in New Orleans, Carlos Marcello’s headquarters. But while in Houston, Ferrie and his companions never got around to ice skating. Instead they took off for Galveston, Texas, and drove 100 miles, arriving there at 10 p.m. on November 23. They happened to arrive just before Jack Ruby’s friend from Dallas, Breck Wall, arrived there. Breck Wall visited the home of Thomas J. McKenna and, shortly thereafter at 11:44 p.m. on November 23, he received a telephone call from Jack Ruby. Why this arduous and seemingly irrational trip and the telephone calls? It does not take much imagination to suspect that the frenetic trip was precipitated by Oswald having been captured in Dallas and that there was an urgent need to communicate with Jack Ruby in a manner that would be difficult to trace. What would be the purposes of communicating with Jack Ruby? First is the logical assumption that somebody must have communicated with Ruby, ordering him to eliminate Oswald. This could readily have been done through Breck Wall. A second possibility is that, after a suitable delay, Ferrie’s mission would be to meet with some of the conspirators at an airport in southern Texas and fly them to Mexico (Ferrie was an excellent pilot). And, finally, the trip may have been to accomplish both purposes—the first purpose being hastily added on when Oswald was captured, thus accelerating Ferrie’s departure from New Orleans on that stormy night. Evidence that Ferrie’s mission to Houston and Galveston was to fly a get-away plane was reinforced when Dick Russell paid a visit in 1975 to a gay activist named Raymond Broshears who had been a roommate of David Ferrie. Russell met with Broshears in San Francisco for an interview in which Broshears said that Ferrie had told him: David was to meet a plane. He was going to fly these people on to Mexico, and eventually to South Africa, which did not have an extradition treaty with the United States. They had left from some little airfield between Dallas and Fort Worth, and David had a twin engine plane ready for them and that was the purpose of his mad dash through a driving rainstorm from New Orleans. But the plane crashed off the coast of Texas near Corpus Christie. That was what David was told in the telephone booth that day. Apparently they had decided to try to make it to Mexico on their own. They did not. [130] Broshears went on to tell Russell that David Ferrie had told him that Lee Oswald did not kill the president. He also said Ferrie had told him that four people were going to shoot Kennedy. He said Ferrie told him this in 1963 before the assassination. He said that later in 1964 Ferrie told him that one of the"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"men fired from a sewer opening along the parade route, another from the grassy knoll, and someone from behind. He said Ferrie told him that Carlos Marcello was the one who put up the money and that Marcello was the person most closely aligned with the people who actually engineered the killing. He said Ferrie told him he never worked for the CIA but might have been working for them without realizing it. Ferrie said that he was working for people he saw as patriotic Americans. Broshears said Ferrie participated in the assassination for patriotic purposes and was manipulated by the government. He said all the people in the assassination were “manipulated very cleverly—by somebody in the government pulling the strings.” [131] Broshears also told Dick Russell that he received a telephone call from David Ferrie shortly before his death (in February 1967). Ferrie told him he was going to be killed, and the next thing Broshears knew, Ferrie was dead. While Ferrie and his companions were in Texas, the New Orleans police were on a major manhunt for him. The FBI and the Secret Service had joined in the hunt. The reason for trying to find Ferrie was that he had been identified on a television program as being a friend of Oswald’s and this had triggered an allegation by Jack Martin, a private investigator and friend of Ferrie’s who worked for Guy Banister. In 1978 Martin testified before the HSCA that he and Banister got into an argument while drinking at a local bar in New Orleans and continued their argument as they went back to their offices at 544 Camp Street. The argument got more intense and Martin shouted at Banister, “What are you going to do—kill me like you all did Kennedy?” According to Martin, Banister then pistol-whipped him, beating Martin over the head with the butt of his .345 magnum. Delphine Roberts, Banister’s secretary, broke up the fight. It was the next day that Martin saw the television program during which three men were discussing Oswald’s friends in New Orleans and mentioned David Ferrie. That afternoon Martin decided to get in touch with the police and telephoned his friend, New Orleans Assistant District Attorney Herman Kohlman, and told him that he suspected that Oswald and Ferrie had conspired to assassinate President Kennedy. The next day, Sunday, November 24, Martin told a friend of Kohlman that Oswald and Ferrie’s relationship went back to 1955 when they had both served on the New Orleans Civil Air Patrol. Martin said that Ferrie had taught Oswald how to fire a rifle with a telescopic sight and that Ferrie hated Kennedy and he had once heard him discussing with Oswald the possibility of assassinating Kennedy. The noose around Ferrie tightened on the morning of November 25 when the FBI learned that Ferrie’s library card had been found on Oswald at the time of his arrest. This information was contained in an FBI teletype of November 28. The library card having been found on Oswald was revealed to the FBI by Marcello’s attorney, G. Wray Gill. Researchers suspect that Gill was tipped off by the Dallas police. The library card has never been seen since. When Ferrie learned in Galveston that the Dallas police were looking for him, he returned to New Orleans on Monday, November 25. He was then interviewed by the FBI, the Secret Service, and the New Orleans police. Transcripts of these interviews were immediately classified and later buried in the National Archives. They were never mentioned in the FBI summary report and were not turned over to the Warren Commission. Also, all of the November records of David Ferrie’s telephone calls were declared “unavailable” by Ferrie’s lawyer, G. Wray Gill. This information only started to surface in 1967 when Jim Garrison began his re-investigation of the Kennedy assassination. Ruby Silences Oswald [132]"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":" As we can see throughout this book, further study of a given subject reveals intricacies of the conspiracy that lead to other suspects. In Ruby’s case, a fuller understanding of his murder of Oswald serves to implicate the Dallas police force, with credible evidence that some of its officers were involved in the JFK assassination conspiracy. There are two basic questions to be addressed: (1) How did Ruby get into the basement of the Dallas police station when it was supposedly so heavily guarded, and when the Dallas sheriff’s office, the Dallas police, and the FBI had been forewarned by three separate telephone calls that Oswald would be shot during the transfer? (2) How can we explain the remarkable coincidence that Ruby shot Oswald when he was being transferred from the jail at 11:21 a.m. on Sunday, November 24, only four minutes after Ruby had wired money to one of his nightclub strippers, Karen Carlin, at a nearby Western Union office? There are two answers that have been suggested for these questions: The first is that Ruby just happened to be at the Western Union office at 11:17 a.m.; just happened to be carrying a loaded revolver in his pocket; just happened to stroll over to the Dallas police station; just happened to walk down an alleyway and just happened to find an unlocked door that opened to a stairway leading to the basement garage of the police headquarters; [133] and just happened to arrive there exactly when Oswald was being transferred. Then, he just happened to have an impulse to pull out his revolver, charge Oswald through a cordon of police (who just happened to let him through), and fatally shoot him. The second answer proposed does not require these ridiculously improbable coincidences. It assumes that there was some very intricate planning and timing which involved bringing Oswald into the basement at the precise time that the police knew Ruby would arrive. The purpose of the Sunday telegram at 11:17 a.m. in that case would be to stage a reason for Ruby to be in the vicinity of the police station at that time. In fact, Ruby himself stated in his testimony to the Warren Commission: ...who else could have timed it so perfectly by seconds. If it were timed that way, then someone in the police department is guilty of giving the information as to when Lee Harvey Oswald was coming down. So let’s look at this possibility in context. To do this, it will be helpful to examine Ruby’s activities in November 1963 and in particular on November 21, 22, 23, and 24. In doing so, we get an extremely interesting portrait of a highly agitated man involved in a conspiracy. This is shown in Exhibit 15-5. Exhibit 15-5. Ruby’s Activities on November 21, 22, 23, 24, 1963.

Jones, in Dallas over a two-week period. The three hadn’t been together since 1947, and Al Gruber hadn’t had contact with Ruby for the preceding ten years. During this same two-week period, Ruby phoned another mob hit man, Lennie Patrick, in Chicago. And on November 17, Ruby took a trip to Las Vegas where he met Lewis McWillie, yet another mob hit man and contact of Santo Trafficante, Jr., in Tampa, Florida. The relationship of Ruby and McWillie went back to the days when Trafficante ran gambling casinos in Cuba, before Castro took over. So here we have Jack Ruby, in addition to his frenzy of telephone calls to Mafia figures all over the United States, having personal meetings with mob hit men shortly before the assassination of John Kennedy."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"The next suspicious activity of note was on the evening of November 21, the day before the assassination, when Ruby met with a Jean Aase and Lawrence Meyers at the Cabana Motel in Dallas. This meeting has particular significance in view of the fact that Jean Aase had received a phone call in Chicago on September 24 from none other than David Ferrie, phoning from New Orleans. [134] By a curious coincidence, Eugene Hale Brading (a.k.a. Jim Braden) was also seen at the Cabana Motel. It was Braden who was arrested in Dealey Plaza a few minutes after the Kennedy assassination as he just happened to be leaving the Dal-Tex Building, which is one of the buildings from which it is believed a shot or shots were fired at Kennedy in the motorcade. The Dallas police questioned Braden and then released him. It just happened that Braden was a Mafia-connected figure, an ex-convict on parole, and just happened to be visiting in Dallas at that time and just happened to be in the Dal-Tex Building to make a phone call. While in Dallas, Braden also just happened to visit the offices of right-wing extremist and oil billionaire H. L. Hunt, friend and backer of Lyndon Johnson. It also just happened that Jack Ruby had visited the offices of H. L. Hunt the day before the assassination. And amazingly, it just happened that Braden had an office in New Orleans next door to the office of Guy Banister, who just happened to share that office on occasion with Lee Harvey Oswald (see Chapter 24, H. L. Hunt and Associates). When Kennedy was shot at 12:30 p.m. on November 22, it is virtually certain that Jack Ruby was in the Dallas Morning News Building. Mary Ferrell, veteran researcher in Dallas, told me that she had four witnesses confirming that fact. Ruby was a professed admirer of Kennedy, and immediately after 12:30 p.m. became intensely preoccupied with the assassination. If he were such an admirer of Kennedy, why would he not have walked the short distance of two blocks to Dealey Plaza to see the motorcade— his once-in-a-lifetime chance to see his president? Could it not be that he deliberately planned to be at the Dallas Morning News Building to give himself an ironclad alibi of not being at the scene of the assassination? Ruby is next seen at Parkland Memorial Hospital between 1:30 and 2:00 p.m. by the highly respected newsman Seth Kantor. Kantor testified that he ran across Ruby in the hallway and spoke to him briefly. What was Ruby doing at Parkland Hospital other than suspiciously following up on the assassination of Kennedy? It has long been suspected that Ruby planted the magic bullet, number 399, on the stretcher. Next, between 2:00 and 3:00 p.m., Ruby went to his Carousel Club and placed a phone call to Al Gruber in Los Angeles. By that time Oswald had been captured. Why would Ruby be calling Gruber? One evident reason is that Oswald, instead of being shot while escaping as planned, had been captured by the Dallas police, and therefore a major problem had emerged; Ruby could have been calling Al Gruber to ask for further instructions. It should be noted that Al Gruber was an associate of Johnny Rosselli who was Sam Giancana’s right-hand man in Los Angeles. At around 7:00 p.m., Ruby is seen at the Dallas police station. He is carrying a loaded gun, to which he admitted in his testimonies to the Warren Commission. Ruby normally did not carry a gun. At 10:00 p.m., Ruby went to the synagogue for religious services. Then, at about 10:30 p.m., he had the Nichols parking garage attendant sign a receipt that Karen Carlin was given $5 at 9:30 p.m. Was Ruby building a case that Carlin was after him for loans? Next, at 11:30 p.m., Ruby returned to the Dallas police station where he attended a press conference at which Oswald was displayed. As the press conference proceeded, the Dallas Morning News spokesman referred to Oswald as having been a member of the “ Free Cuba Committee.” Ruby interjected to tell everybody that it was actually “The Fair Play for Cuba” committee. This curious remark was made only hours after Oswald was captured. How did Ruby know the correct name, to the letter, of an obscure committee in New Orleans of which Oswald was the sole member? At some time between 2:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m., Ruby met a Dallas policeman by the name of Harry"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Olsen who was with a dancer, Kay Coleman. Ruby sat in Olsen’s car in a parking garage for about one hour during which time, Ruby later testified, Olsen told him that somebody should “take care of Oswald.” During all of the preceding, Ruby had exhibited outbursts of tears and emotion about the Kennedy assassination. He alternately appeared to be grief-stricken, highly energized, and agitated. At one time, when he was with his sister, he went in the bathroom and vomited out of overwhelming emotion. So now, at 4:00 a.m. on the morning of November 23, Ruby gave a demonstration of a twist board at the Dallas Times Herald Building, much to the amusement of people watching. He then went home, and at 4:30 a.m. woke up his roommate, George Senator. He then called an employee to bring a Polaroid camera so that the three of them could take a picture of an “Impeach Earl Warren” sign at Dealey Plaza. They went to Dealey Plaza and took the picture while Ruby talked about the importance of this sign because it implied a right-wing conspiracy to kill Kennedy. Ruby then went back to his home at 6:00 a.m. and went to bed. He is next seen at 3:00 p.m. on November 23, standing in front of the county jail waiting for the Oswald transfer. Oswald was scheduled to be moved to the jail at that time but there was a last-minute change. When Ruby learned this, he went to the Dallas police station—to the third floor—still carrying his loaded gun. On the evening of November 23, Ruby was observed at various places in Dallas where there were pay telephones. Then, at 11:44 p.m., he succeeded in making the telephone call to Breck Wall in Galveston just after David Ferrie’s arrival there (he made several attempts to place the call before finally getting through). The telephone call lasted only two minutes. Why would Ruby be calling Breck Wall in Galveston so incessantly except to receive a message that may well have been delivered by David Ferrie from Carlos Marcello to Ruby via Breck Wall? Could this have been the final message to Ruby, telling him that he was to silence Oswald under all circumstances? The next evidence of Ruby’s whereabouts was shortly after 2:15 a.m. when the Dallas sheriff’s office and the FBI offices received warnings that Oswald would be shot in the transfer to the county jail the next day. The man in the sheriff’s office who received this call later identified the voice as belonging to Jack Ruby. Was this an attempt by Jack Ruby, a distraught man fearing for his life, to delay the transfer or to make it impossible for him to be able to go through with the silencing of Oswald and thereby warrant his own death sentence? At 2:30 a.m. the Dallas police received a similar warning that Oswald was going to be shot during the transfer. We now arrive at the morning of November 24 when Ruby shot Oswald at 11:17 a.m. There is conflicting testimony concerning Ruby’s activities that morning. According to Ruby, and supported by the telephone record, he received a telephone call from one of his nightclub strippers, Karen Carlin, at 10:19 a.m., requesting that $25 be wired to her as an emergency loan. (In later testimony, Carlin confirmed that she had made that telephone call.) After receiving the call, Ruby stated that he went to the Western Union office and wired the $25 to her at 11:17 a.m. (This was supported by Western Union records.) Ruby said he then walked over to the Dallas police building, walked down an auto ramp leading to the basement, and on impulse pulled out his gun and shot Oswald in the abdomen at close range. The problem with Ruby’s story is that there are several credible witnesses who testified that Ruby was hanging around the Dallas police building all morning between 8:00 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. These witnesses were TV news crewmen and a preacher who saw Ruby on an elevator in the police building at about 9:30 a.m. Correspondingly, Ruby’s cleaning lady, Elnora Pitts, testified that she called Ruby’s apartment some time after 8:00 a.m. when a strange voice responded who did not appear to know who she was. [135] Ruby’s roommate, George Senator, confirmed Ruby’s story. But Senator is suspected of having helped Ruby in his scheme. This is based on evidence that Senator placed a telephone call from the Eat Well Cafe to attorney Jim Martin in Dallas a few minutes before Ruby shot Oswald , requesting that the"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"attorney represent Ruby for the shooting that had not yet occurred . [136] An understanding of what actually took place is facilitated by placing oneself in the minds of the conspirators after Oswald was captured. Oswald had begun talking and requested an attorney from New York who was experienced in conspiracy cases. The conspirators, in a panic, realized that Oswald must be silenced—immediately. Having Oswald killed in his jail cell was too obvious and would clearly implicate the Dallas police. The only alternative was to have him shot while being transferred to the county jail while in the presence of a large number of newsmen and bystanders. The unlucky person selected to perform the execution was Jack Ruby, who was ordered to do so by his Mafia superiors. This order was coordinated through Ruby’s telephone calls to Al Gruber in Los Angeles, and Ruby’s subsequent telephone call to Breck Wall in Galveston after David Ferrie arrived there. Obviously this scheme would take considerable coordination and planning to make it appear to be an act of emotion by an enraged citizen who was an admirer of the Kennedys. Several elements would be required for the plan to be successful: (1) There must have been a reason for Ruby to be near the police station at the time of the transfer. Otherwise it would look less emotionally spontaneous and more deliberately planned. Thus his placing the telegram to Karen Carlin at 11:17 a.m. following her call to his apartment at 10:19 a.m. (2) Karen Carlin would have to be brought into the scheme, at least to get her to place the 10:19 a.m. call. She would later be intimidated by the conspirators to testify to that effect. Shortly after her testimony she disappeared and has not been seen or heard from since . [137] (3) In order for Ruby to be on top of things and to receive messages regarding the exact timing of the transfer, he would have to be free on the morning of November 24 and near the Dallas police building. Thus, he would need someone to take calls for him in his apartment. (4) When the time of transfer was set, Ruby would be signaled, and he would then go to the Western Union office to place his telegram. When he came out of the office and was walking toward the police building, he would be observed by a conspiratorial coordinator, and at that moment Oswald would be brought down the elevator and into the police building basement, timed exactly for the execution. If there were an unanticipated delay in bringing Oswald into the basement, there would be a means devised to hold Ruby off for a few minutes. (5) Arrangements would have to be made for Ruby to get into the basement. This would be accomplished by someone in the Dallas police station simply leaving a door unlocked leading from the alley to the basement. All of this fits into actual events. Supporting evidence is found in the statements of Karen Carlin just after the assassination. In her first official interview on November 24, 1963, Carlin “was reluctant to make any statement.” She explained that she suspected an assassination conspiracy and that she “would be killed if she gave any information to the authorities.” Secret Service agent Roger C. Warner described the interview: “She twisted in her chair, stammered in her speech, and seemed on the point of hysteria.” She would give information only “through the aid of her husband” and then asked “that all information she had related be kept confidential to prevent retaliation against her in case there was a plot afoot.” [138] It was after giving that testimony that she vanished. As stated earlier, one of the purposes of this discussion is to establish evidence of the involvement of the Dallas police in the scheme to silence Oswald. Most compelling is evidence showing that, indeed, the killing of Oswald by Ruby was carefully orchestrated and would have been practically impossible without the help of the Dallas police. To be more specific, there was a Dallas policeman who may have"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"been directly involved—Sergeant Patrick T. Dean. Sergeant Dean was a good friend of Jack Ruby. He was also in charge of security in the basement of the police building that morning. Further, he was on good terms with Joe Civello, Mafia boss in Dallas, subordinate to Carlos Marcello in New Orleans. (Dean joined Civello for dinner shortly after Civello returned from the famous Appalachian meeting of major mob chieftains in November 1957.) [139] It is especially noteworthy that Dean is the one who verified Ruby’s statement that he entered the basement via the auto ramp, which was later refuted by numerous witnesses as having been impossible without their having seen him. Dean flunked a lie-detector test on his story. [140] In summary, in view of all of the foregoing evidence and circumstances, Ruby’s murder of Oswald has all the appearances of a meticulously planned event, involving elements of the Dallas police and the Mafia. This suspicion was confirmed to columnist Jack Anderson in the 1970s by the aging mobster Johnny Rosselli, who described Ruby as “one of our boys” and said that Ruby had been ordered to kill Oswald. The Murder of Officer J. D. Tippit Please refer to Exhibit 15-6 for the following discussion. In Chapter 10, evidence was presented showing that the Dallas police and the FBI, working in concert, forged and concealed evidence concerning the number of empty cartridges found on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. Combining that with the evidence of Dallas police complicity in Oswald’s murder further strengthens the case against the Dallas police. But there is more. This has to do with the murder of Dallas police officer J. D. Tippit in Oak Cliff, Texas, a suburb of Dallas, sometime between thirty-six and forty-five minutes after the murder of John Kennedy. The time of Tippit’s murder was established by a witness, T. F. Bowley, who was driving by and saw Tippit’s body lying next to his squad car. Bowley looked at his watch; it was 1:10 p.m. [141] Oswald was blamed for Tippit’s murder although it was established that he was nine-tenths of a mile away, standing at a bus stop no earlier than 1:03 p.m. This was witnessed by his landlady, Earlene Roberts, [142] who said that she was certain of the time because she was watching a television news show that came on at 1:00 p.m., whereupon Oswald arrived at his apartment. She said he went into his room and left a few minutes later. This time was confirmed by the Warren Commission: After leaving the depository building at approximately 12:33 p.m., Lee Harvey Oswald proceeded to his rooming house by bus and taxi. He arrived at approximately 1:00 p.m. and left a few minutes later. If we take the latest time of the shooting of Tippit as 1:10 p.m., Oswald would have had to run a six- minute mile to be at the scene of the crime. Yet the Warren Commission could not locate one witness who saw Oswald, or anyone else, running or walking from his rooming house to the scene of the Tippit slaying at 10th Street and Patton Avenue."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Exhibit 15-6. Relationship of Oswald’s Rooming House and Tippit Murder Scene to the Texas Theater. Map showing Oswald’s alleged whereabouts as related to the murder of Dallas police officer J. D. Tippit. (Not drawn to scale.) The Warren Commission, facing this inconvenient set of facts, tried to establish that the murder of Tippit took place at 1:15 p.m. based on Dallas police records that a man had keyed into a microphone at 1:16 p.m. saying, “Hello police operator—we’ve had a shooting here—it’s a police officer, somebody shot him.” The time of 1:15 p.m. was an arbitrary assumption on the part of the Dallas police or the Warren Commission and did not consider the time of 1:10 p.m. witnessed and noted by T. F. Bowley. But even if Tippit had been shot at 1:15 p.m. Oswald still would not have had time to walk to the crime scene. [143] The Commission estimated Oswald’s other walks from the Texas School Book Depository to a bus, and from the bus to a taxi, as one minute per block. Oswald’s rooming house was the equivalent of eighteen blocks from the Tippit murder scene. Therefore, if Oswald had left his rooming house at 1:03 p.m. (as the Commission accepted), he could not have arrived at the murder scene until 1:21 p.m., six minutes too late to commit the murder. The Commission ignored this. [144] The timing evidence leaves only one reasonable conclusion: Oswald could not have shot Tippit unless he were driven to the murder scene by someone. But, obviously, that is an entirely different matter; Oswald would have needed an accomplice to do the driving. It was very important for the Warren Commission to establish that Oswald shot Tippit because it added to their theory that he was some sort of a crazy nut, wantonly killing people. Their circuitous argument was that Oswald killed Tippit because he had just killed Kennedy and was fleeing the scene; then they turned it around saying that Oswald was a nut who could have killed Kennedy because he was a crazy killer as proven by the murder of Tippit. There were three eyewitnesses to the actual killing of Tippit: Helen Markham, Acquilla Clemons, and Domingo Benavides. Of these, only Helen Markham identified Oswald at the scene of the murder. But as will be seen, her testimony cannot be taken seriously. Here is how the questions went in the hearing: "},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Mr. Ball: Now when you went into the room you looked these people over, these four men? Mrs. Markham: Yes, sir. Mr. Ball: Did you recognize anyone in the line-up? Mrs. Markham: No, sir. Mr. Ball: You did not? Did you see anybody—I have asked you that question before—did you recognize anybody from their face? Mrs. Markham: From their face, no. Mr. Ball: Did you identify anybody in these four people? Mrs. Markham: I didn’t know nobody. Mr. Ball: I know you didn’t know anybody, but did anybody in that lineup look like anybody you had seen before? Mrs. Markham: No. I had never seen none of them before, none of these men. Mr. Ball: No one of the four? Mrs. Markham: No one of them. Mr. Ball: No one of all four? Mrs. Markham: No, sir . [145] After more questioning with confused answers, in desperation, the Warren Commission attorney finally resorted to leading his own witness: Mr. Ball: You recognized him from his appearance? Mrs. Markham: I asked—I looked at him. When I saw this man I wasn’t sure, but I had cold chills just run over me. [146] It is obvious from her testimony that Helen Markham had an extremely confused mind. Moreover, in other portions of her statements she said she was alone with Tippit for twenty minutes after he was shot (impossible within the clearly established maximum time restraints) and that during this time Tippit had talked to her. [147] The other two witnesses, Clemons and Benavides, did not identify Oswald as the killer and were not brought to the Commission as witnesses (as you might by now presume, J. Edgar Hoover had ordered his investigators not to question Clemons). Clemons stated that she saw two men standing near Officer Tippit’s car at the time of the murder. She saw one of the men with a pistol waving the other away as he ran down to Jefferson Street. The running man she described as “kind of short, kind of heavy.” The second man she described as tall and thin, in clothing totally different from what Oswald was wearing that day. She said that Dallas police officers told her not to tell anyone what she had told them lest she be killed. [148] Benavides was the closest of the witnesses; he was located only a few yards away when the murder was committed. He could not identify Oswald as being there. There were several other witnesses (not to the actual killing) who had valuable information, none of it linking Oswald to the crime, but they, too, were not called by the Commission. One of these witnesses was Frank Wright, who saw the last part of the scene that was described by Clemons. Jim Garrison wrote: Mr. Wright, who had been inside the house, came out in time to see Officer Tippit roll over on the ground, probably the last move of his life. Wright observed another man looking down on the"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"fallen officer. Then the man circled around the police car and got into an old, gray car on the other side of it. He drove off rapidly. It seemed to me quite probably that this was the second man Clemons had observed, the one who was waved off by the short, heavy one who ran away. It began to dawn on me that these witnesses were saying something no one else had said: Officer Tippit was killed by two men, neither of whom was Lee Oswald. The implications, I realized, were staggering. If Oswald was innocent of the Tippit murder, the foundation of the government’s case against him collapsed. [149] There was one other witness, Warren Reynolds, who identified Oswald in a line-up as the man he saw running away from the scene. But Reynolds’ testimony is suspect. As described by Jim Garrison: “Warren Reynolds, who had seen a gunman running on Jefferson Street a block from the shooting, did testify that the man he had seen was Oswald. But the circumstances of his testimony were highly suspicious. Reynolds had initially told the FBI that he would ‘hesitate’ to identify Oswald as the running man. Shortly afterwards, Reynolds had been shot in the head in the dark of a car lot basement.” After a miraculous recovery in the hospital, Reynolds had second thoughts about what he had seen and decided the running man actually was Oswald. Not only had the Commission failed to tie Oswald to the murder of Tippit, by either the timing evidence or by eyewitnesses, they also failed to tie the four bullets found in Tippit’s body with Oswald’s revolver. The FBI crime lab tested the four bullets and could not make a match. Not only that, three of the bullets were copper coated and manufactured by Winchester Western Company. The fourth was a lead bullet manufactured by the Remington Peters Company. Bullets are never sold in mixed lots, which raises the question of how Oswald happened to have the revolver loaded with bullets from two manufacturers. Four cartridges allegedly found at the crime scene were matched to Oswald’s revolver, but not until a six-day delay by Dallas police, during which time they had possession of the revolver. The initial list of evidence by the Dallas police did not include cartridges of any kind, arousing suspicion that Oswald’s revolver had been fired after the fact to produce the cartridges. But to the embarrassment of the Dallas police and the Warren Commission, it was discovered that the cartridges submitted belatedly as evidence were probably not the cartridges actually found at the scene, because the ones that were found had been handed to Officer J. M. Poe, who later testified that he believed he had marked them with his initials. There were no initials of any kind on any of the four cartridges. [150] To sort all this out, I listed the key items of evidence concerning the Tippit murder: - According to the Commission Report, the four bullets found in Tippit’s body could not be identified with Oswald’s revolver. - Of the four bullets, three were from one manufacturer and the fourth from another manufacturer. Bullets are not sold in mixed lots. - There was a six-day delay by Dallas police in submitting the cartridges to the FBI, during which time they had possession of the revolver and plausibly could have fired bullets to create the cartridges. - The cartridges, belatedly submitted to the FBI, did not bear the initials of Officer Poe, who had marked them with his initials when he found them. Unless Oswald had been driven by someone to a spot near the crime scene, [151] then walked the remainder of the way, it seemed certain that Oswald could not have killed Tippit. My view is that, instead of going to 10th and Patton, Oswald had walked or was driven to the Texas Theater for some purpose, probably to rendezvous with someone who would get him out of the country"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"where he would later be murdered. Why was Officer Tippit murdered? There are various proposed scenarios. Some researchers have come to believe that Tippit was murdered by a jealous husband whose wife was having an affair with Tippit, i.e., Tippit was killed for a reason having nothing to do with Oswald. A second scenario is that Tippit was murdered by the conspirators to set up Oswald as a wanton killer, thus linking him to the JFK assassination. A third scenario is that Tippit was supposed to have picked up Oswald at a spot near Oswald’s rooming house, but for some reason he failed to do so, either losing his courage or bungling the effort. The plotters, fearing that Tippit would talk, ordered that he be killed. In this scenario, Tippit was supposed to have taken Oswald to a private airport, where he would be flown somewhere and killed. Oswald, missing his ride, in desperation proceeded on foot and ducked into the Texas Theater, knowing nothing else to do. He was spotted going into the theater and then captured; I tend to favor this scenario. But there is one thing that the evidence demonstrates for certain: Key individuals within the Dallas police, although not necessarily involved in the plot to kill John Kennedy, were deeply involved in a conspiracy to pin the murder on Oswald, and they had the cooperation of, if not orders from, the FBI. I decided at this point not to pursue the murder of Tippit further, however fascinating the mystery. It would remain a loose end. But my inquiry had borne enough fruit to proceed. I now turned to consideration of another Mafia leader who is a prime suspect in the assassination, namely Sam Giancana. Sam Giancana A question that has been asked many times is: “If the killing of Kennedy was a conspiracy involving many people, how could it possibly have been kept secret all this time? Why hasn’t somebody talked?” The answer to that question is simple. A lot of people have talked. The talking started before the assassination and has continued to this day. There are many examples: Carlos Marcello bragged in front of Ed Becker that Kennedy would be killed and described how it would be done; Santo Trafficante, Jr., bragged that Kennedy would be killed; Joseph Milteer, right-wing nut, bragged that Kennedy would be killed and how it would be done; Johnny Rosselli, Sam Giancana’s right-hand man, told Jack Anderson (years later) that Ruby was “their man and was ordered to silence Oswald.” David Atlee Phillips, suspected of being the mysterious Maurice Bishop and perpetrator of the multiple Oswalds, said before he died that fringe elements of U.S. intelligence may have been involved in the conspiracy. As earlier noted, Lyndon Johnson’s mistress, Madeleine Brown, has said that Lyndon Johnson implied before Kennedy was killed that it was going to happen. Marita Lorenz, CIA contract agent, stated in depositions for a courtroom trial that Frank Sturgis told her that he and a group of anti-Castro Cubans had been involved in the Kennedy assassination. And, finally, Sam Giancana’s brother, Chuck Giancana, revealed in a recent book Double Cross that his brother Sam Giancana confessed to the entire crime in 1966 (in an hour-long discussion at Chuck Giancana’s suburban home in Chicago), just before Sam Giancana was to move to Mexico City. I have often thought that if the full truth ever came out about the Kennedy assassination, it would be in the form of talk and confessions by individuals who were either part of the assassination or were friends or relatives of the conspirators. This is just common sense: most humans have a serious problem keeping a secret, particularly when it preys on their conscience or when it is very important information, or when they are near the end of life’s road. A great irony is that most or all of these confessions and revelations must be dismissed by investigators. But professional killers and political leaders have perfected their art so that they leave no trails— the art of “plausible deniability,” a term coined by spy agencies. Often the"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"only evidence we will find to identify the ringleaders will be in such hearsay, or their signals of confession reflected by their guilt-ridden acts or braggadocio before or after the crime. Some of this information is called “too good to be true.” Another way to attempt to discredit information is if it is published in a book and the book is sold for a profit. (Presumably, doctors, lawyers, judges, and engineers can work for a profit without their work being tainted, but not authors.) But to throw out all of this information as not being of courtroom quality is to perhaps throw away the only information that will tell the whole story; and, out of a foolish adherence to “science” and a hypercritical skepticism, let heinous criminals free. In this book, I have carefully attempted to segregate evidence and information that is of courtroom quality from the kinds of evidence and information described above. But if one seriously wants to get a complete story of the assassination, and is not personally compelled to play the role of professional skeptic, it is indispensable to consider such information. That is not to say that all confessions and information that are printed or released are worthy of lengthy consideration. There have been many people who have confessed to the killing of John Kennedy. Obviously we have to separate the mentally unbalanced who confess to crimes and those who write books or tell stories purely for profit from those who are telling a genuine story. This is indeed a difficult task. My approach has been to take the most credible stories first at face value, summarize them, and then examine them to see if I can find discrepancies or conflicts when they are fitted into a total picture, or valid reasons to suspect that they are either fraudulent or invalid. In the end, one’s personal judgments are required. In the controversial book Double Cross, [152] Chuck Giancana seems to portray Sam Giancana as bragging rather than confessing. The story in Double Cross is, without exaggeration, all hearsay, without a shred of documentation in the book to support it, and thus should be viewed very critically; but that does not exclude the possibility that it is essentially true. The following passages summarize, in extremely condensed form, what Sam Giancana told his half-brother Chuck: Ruby had been Sam Giancana’s “man in Dallas” for years, running guns for the CIA as well. He had previously demonstrated loyalty and the ability to work with the CIA during the planning for the Bay of Pigs invasion. Ruby had formed friendships with undercover agents—men like Oswald. At one point Ruby went so far as to give David Ferrie a job in his Carousel Club. Ruby was ordered by the Mafia to silence Oswald. He used his associations with the Dallas police force to gain entry to the police station during Oswald’s transfer. Oswald, like Ruby, had ties to both the CIA and the Mafia. Oswald’s uncle was a Marcello lieutenant who had exerted a powerful influence over the fatherless boy. Oswald had formed an alliance with the U.S. intelligence community, first as a young man in the Civil Air Patrol with David Ferrie, a homosexual CIA operative and Mafia smuggling pilot. Chuck Giancana stated that over the years he had heard the names of many oil men mentioned by Sam Giancana as “business associates,” among them Sid Richardson, H. L. Hunt, Clint Murchison, and Mike Davis. Chuck Giancana had also heard the names of several Texas politicians, including Lyndon Johnson and John Connally, whom Sam Giancana said had received substantial Mafia and oil money backing. The decision to finalize the plans for their elimination of the president were made in the early spring of 1963. Oswald was a natural choice as the fall guy. Sam Giancana said that the entire conspiracy went “right up to the top of the CIA.” He said that fanatical right-wing Texans, Lyndon Johnson, Nixon, and a Bay of Pigs action officer were involved. Chuck Giancana stated that a key man of Sam Giancana’s was Richard Cain. “Cain was an operative and Outfit man who secretly had worked as a spy for Sam Giancana in the Chicago sheriff’s department.”"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Sam Giancana said that the Dallas assassination had taken months to mastermind. Dozens of men were involved, and the hit had been planned for several different cities—Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Dallas. But, ultimately, the president had been lured to Dallas. That city provided the best opportunity for a successful assassination. Chuck Giancana stated that he would later learn through the Outfit grapevine that Sam Giancana solicited professional killers from several quarters required to be “top-notch marks-men”—two of Marcello’s men, Charles Harrelson [153] and Jack Lawrence, as well as two of Trafficante’s Cuban exile “friends.” From Chicago, Sam Giancana brought in Richard Cain, Chuckie Nicoletti, and Felix “Milwaukee Phil” Alderisio, who all worked previously on the Bay of Pigs operation. Sam Giancana said that both Cain and Nicoletti were actual gunman for the hit being placed at opposite ends of the Texas School Book Depository. In fact, Giancana said it was Cain, not Oswald, who actually fired from the infamous sixth-story window. Sam Giancana also alleged that the CIA had added several of their own “soldiers” to the team, using Roscoe White and J. D. Tippit as the actual gunmen—along with Frank (Sturgis) Fiorini [154] * and Lee Harvey Oswald, the man Giancana said they intended to frame as the lone assassin. During the operation, Sam Giancana said the CIA upper echelon sequestered themselves in a hotel surrounded by electronic equipment. With the aid of walkie talkies, the men were able to secure their firing positions and learn of Oswald’s whereabouts immediately following the hit. To eliminate Oswald, Giancana said the CIA had selected Roscoe White and J. D. Tippit, who both—like Richard Cain— had served in Chicago’s sheriffs’ department and held positions in law enforcement on the Dallas police force. Chuck Giancana quotes his brother as saying, “the hit in Dallas was just like any other operation we’d worked on in the past.... We’d overthrown other governments and other countries plenty of times before. This time we did it in our own backyard.” He said the murder of President Kennedy was little different from the plot to kill Castro, the murder of Vietnam’s leaders, that of Panama’s president—or any of the other dozens of military/CIA-sponsored coups perpetrated throughout the world. The above key items, if they can be believed, explain virtually the entire assassination, except that they do not name the top CIA people and do not specifically name the implied Texas right-wing wealthy backers. Is it too good to be true? To get another opinion on the story, I wrote to a veteran assassination researcher, Paul Hoch. He sent me a return letter which said: In brief: Any information actually originating from Sam Giancana is perhaps hopelessly obscured by the obvious contributions of the author’s “research” to Double Cross . The references to Roscoe White, Charles Harrelson, Frank Sturgis and Jack Lawrence are in my opinion sufficient to discredit the book as evidence. Between you and me it amazes me that stuff like that can get published. Paul Hoch is a long-time critic who questions pro-conspiracy theories. He can find reasonable doubt in virtually anything. But what if most or part of Double Cross is true? To arbitrarily toss it in the trash because of a few defects could be a serious mistake. So let us try to evaluate its validity. Why would Chuck Giancana lie about this? He is, after all, accusing the mob and his brother of assassinating the president of the United States. This would seem to be a dangerous thing to do, even so long after the event. The skeptics will immediately say, “Are you naive—he did it for the money.” However, a plausible reason for me to question parts of the story, particularly the implication of Lyndon Johnson, Nixon, and the CIA, is that when he told his story to his brother Chuck, Sam Giancana may have been trying to add legitimacy to the Mafia and therefore may have exaggerated the role of"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"government in the assassination; or, perhaps, implicating high government officials assuaged his own guilt for having murdered the president and betraying his country. [155] Or, conceivably in the same way, Chuck Giancana himself was trying to add such legitimacy; but Double Cross in many parts rings true to me, and it fits to a considerable degree with most of the evidence, with occasional exceptions. Double Cross is a biography of Sam Giancana insofar as his early family life and life of crime are concerned. The book was actually written by Sam Giancana’s nephew, Sam M. Giancana, son of Chuck Giancana. Chuck Giancana related these stories to his son and collaborated in writing the book. Sam M. Giancana has appeared on television on numerous occasions and has strongly attested to the truth of the book. He is impressive. Chuck Giancana and his son Sam say that they wrote the book out of a concern for their country and out of a belief that they should not keep this information secret any longer—it had preyed on their minds too long. They say the book was written with “no small measure of fear” involved. They said that they have become tired of being under the stigma of being related to Sam Giancana and living under a changed name. In an interview on national television, David Scheim, author of the highly respected book Contract on America, stated that the information in Double Cross fits very well into what he knows about the assassination. [156] I was impressed by the fact that Double Cross was published after I had started my book; I had already developed my overall hypothesis, in which I had concluded from an analysis of motive, means, and opportunity that the Mafia, the CIA, J. Edgar Hoover, and Lyndon Johnson were the most likely combination to make the plot work and to cover up the crime. Sam Giancana’s book also buttresses my initial assumption that the primary motive in the crime was a defensive reaction of the conspirators to save themselves from being annihilated by the Kennedys. In the case of Sam Giancana, his brother relates Sam’s rage and feeling of having been double-crossed by the Kennedys who accepted his favors, led him on, and then proceeded to try to destroy him. Sam Giancana was shot and killed on June 19, 1975 in the basement den of his home in Chicago. He was 67 years old. He was shot at close range in the back of the head while frying sausages with his back turned toward his executioner. His execution was just before he was scheduled to appear at a Senate Church Committee hearing. His executioner was certainly someone he knew. The killer entered the basement through heavy steel doors that had been opened by Giancana. He was shot with a .22 revolver pressed against the base of his skull at the back of his head for the first shot. He was then shot in the mouth with five more bullets under the chin into his brain. The .22 revolver was traced by the FBI to the Miami, Florida, territory of Santo Trafficante. One suspect for the killing is Johnny Rosselli. It is believed by some that the execution was ordered by Trafficante. Questions that remain: Did Giancana know his execution was coming? Did the CIA or some other powerful group have Trafficante arrange his murder? Or did the CIA do it with its own contract agents? The mob had no apparent motive to execute Giancana. According to his brother Chuck, Sam was on good terms with the mob, in his weakened condition was no threat to it, and he had taken care of everybody. But Chuck did say that one week before Giancana’s murder, Giancana had ordered the execution of Jimmy Hoffa, indicating perhaps that Giancana was killed by inter-Mafia rivals. Frank Ragano, Hoffa’s lawyer, had a different opinion. He wrote that “undoubtedly, Giancana was murdered to prevent him from talking about the CIA-Castro plot or any other Mafia secret.” [157] Sam Giancana had spent eight years in Mexico between 1966 and 1974 with his cohort Richard Cain. Giancana was commandeered from his walled garden in San Cristobal, Mexico, by immigration agents and extradited back to the United States for a hearing before a grand jury in 1974. He cooperated with the"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"grand jury but, according to Chuck Giancana, said nothing of importance. Before moving to Mexico in 1966, Sam Giancana spent one year in jail from June 1965 to Memorial Day 1966 for contempt of court. It was just after his release from jail in 1966 that he told his story to his brother Chuck and soon left for Mexico City Santo Trafficante, Jr. During the course of its investigation of Santo Trafficante, the House Select Committee on Assassinations examined an allegation that Trafficante had told a prominent Cuban exile, José Aleman, that President Kennedy was going to be assassinated. Aleman testified that Trafficante made that statement in a private conversation with him some time in September 1962. He quoted Trafficante as saying that President Kennedy was “going to be hit.” Aleman was quoted as having noted that Trafficante had spoken of Jimmy Hoffa during the same conversation, indicating that the president would “get what is coming to him” as a result of Kennedy’s intense efforts to prosecute Hoffa. Aleman stated that during the course of the discussion, Trafficante had made clear to him that he was not guessing that the president was going to be killed; rather, that he did in fact know that such a crime was being planned. Aleman also stated that Trafficante had given him the distinct impression that Hoffa would be principally involved in planning the presidential murder. [158] [159] The fact that Hoffa had on several occasions discussed the possibility of the assassination of Robert Kennedy has been noted. This was brought out to the HSCA by one of the Teamsters lieutenants, Edward Partin, who said he discussed with Hoffa the planning of a conspiracy to assassinate Robert Kennedy in July or August 1962. [160] [161] This was one to two months before Trafficante spoke to Aleman. Note that the discussion included the advisability of having the assassination committed somewhere in the south while Robert Kennedy was riding in a convertible. Also, Hoffa had stated that in this type of plot a lone assassin with a rifle and a telescopic sight would be used and the origin of the fatal shot or shots would be obscured. [162] [163] This, of course, is a precise description of what happened at Dealey Plaza, except that John Kennedy was the target instead of his brother. This ties in with further statements by Frank Ragano (Hoffa’s and Trafficante’s personal lawyer for over twenty-seven years) that he was told by Hoffa to pass the word to Trafficante and Marcello that “they had to kill the president.” Ragano said he passed this message on when he met with Marcello and Trafficante in the Royal Orleans Hotel in New Orleans when he said, “You won’t believe what Jimmy wants me to tell you. Jimmy wants you to kill President Kennedy.” Ragano said that neither Trafficante nor Marcello even cracked a smile. He said, “They looked at each other in a way that scared me. They took it seriously.” Years later Santo Trafficante made a deathbed confession to Frank Ragano of his involvement in the assassination of John Kennedy. This happened in early 1987 when Trafficante, having just turned seventy- two, knew he did not have long to live. His kidneys had failed, his heart was weak, and he faced triple- bypass surgery at the Texas Bypass Heart Institution in Houston. This story was reported by Blakey in his book Fatal Hour. Ragano also appeared on national television and very convincingly told the same story. As Trafficante contemplated death, he called Ragano to his side in Tampa, Florida. They had a long series of conversations during which Trafficante voiced his indignation over the Kennedys and their intrusions on his “business” and personal life. As the conversation proceeded, Ragano was stunned when"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Trafficante brought up the subject of the JFK assassination. The dying Trafficante said he believed a mistake had been made, and he blamed it on Marcello. “Carlos fucked up,” he confided to Ragano. “We shouldn’t have killed Giovanni. We should have killed Bobby.” [164] (Giovanni is Italian for John and was apparently the Mafia’s code name for John Kennedy.) Blakey wrote that he thoroughly investigated Ragano’s statements and “all things considered, we believe Ragano was telling the truth, as best he remembers it.” [165] This confession, added to Sam Giancana’s confession, tends to confirm my feeling that the enormity of the crime of assassinating a beloved president of the United States must have weighed heavily on the conspirators, even though they were gangsters and killers beforehand. But Ragano wrote in his autobiography, Mob Lawyer, that he thinks that Trafficante showed no remorse or guilt in his confession. Ragano wrote: “With his warped sense of historical judgment, Santo was probably searching for a way to let the world know that Kennedy’s death had been masterminded by the Mafia with his help. Throughout his adult life, Santo was an incessant reader of biographies and an amateur student of history. I remember his indignation when he had been compelled to lie before the House Assassination Committee and distort the circumstances of the Mafia’s sham alliance with the CIA to kill Castro. Another reason I believe he confessed to me was his perverse pride that he and his mob partners had eliminated a president, outwitted the government’s top law-enforcement agencies, and escaped punishment.” Putting this evidence together, it appears that Carlos Marcello, Santo Trafficante, Jr., and Jimmy Hoffa may indeed have been the origin of the first plans to assassinate John Kennedy. Hoffa’s target was initially Bobby Kennedy but, on the urging of Marcello, the target was changed to John Kennedy. Santo Trafficante, Jr., was the son of a Sicilian immigrant. At the age of thirty-nine he inherited his father’s organized crime operations in Florida and Cuba. Of all the mobsters, Trafficante was the most urbane and sophisticated. He wore only custom-tailored clothing, had manicures, and collected books on history. He liked classical music and read widely. And, of all the Mafia chieftains, Trafficante was the one most deeply affected by Fidel Castro’s takeover of Cuba. When Castro took over Cuba, Santo was thrown into prison after his gambling and hotel activities in Cuba were run into the ground by Castro’s government. Trafficante was deported back to Florida. Trafficante admitted to the HSCA and others that he was involved with the CIA in the plots to assassinate Fidel Castro. Similarly, Carlos Marcello admitted to involvement in such plots. These plots originated when the CIA contracted with the Mafia for its assistance, using Robert Maheu (better known as the manager of Howard Hughes’ activities in Las Vegas) as a go-between. Maheu made a contact through Johnny Rosselli (Sam Giancana’s man) in Los Angeles and the plot to kill Castro got under way. From the evidence available to date, Robert Kennedy apparently was not aware of the plot to kill Castro using the Mafia when he stepped up his activities against organized crime, making specific targets of Hoffa, Trafficante, Giancana, and Marcello. An explosive situation developed wherein the Mafia chieftains knew that they had compromised the U.S. government and thereby could have been emboldened to carry out a plot to assassinate the president. It could have been a relatively easy decision. They could well have thought that the U.S. government would never investigate the crime because of the secret partnership between organized crime and the CIA to assassinate Castro. If, on top of this, the Mafia could induce Lyndon Johnson and Hoover to join in the conspiracy (for their own reasons of self-preservation), all the elements would fall in place for the crime and cover-up. The Mafia had considerable prejudicial evidence against Lyndon Johnson, having bribed and compromised him many times in the past—Johnson was in deep political trouble with the possibility of going to the penitentiary for his involvement in the Bobby Baker scandal. And Johnson was about to be"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"dumped from the Democratic ticket, thus putting an ignominious end to his political career. Similarly, the Mafia had Hoover in its pocket. And Hoover feared that President Kennedy, at the end of his present term, would not reappoint him as FBI director. Taking all of this into account, it appears reasonable that Johnson and Hoover could have been readily brought into the plot for an indispensable purpose: their unique power to cover up the crime if it became necessary. It is interesting to examine a plausible sequence of the deaths among the major Mafia conspirators in the assassination, as indicated by the evidence: First, Sam Giancana ordered the death of Jimmy Hoffa. Then, Santo Trafficante, Jr., had Johnny Rosselli kill Sam Giancana. Then Trafficante had Johnny Rosselli killed, leaving only Trafficante and Marcello. After Rosselli’s death, Trafficante—in an FBI wiretap—remarked, “Now only two people are alive who know who killed Kennedy. And they aren’t talking.” [166] By that time, Johnson and Hoover were dead. Summary of Key Points of Chapter 15 The following recapitulates the strongest evidence [167] concerning the involvement of the Mafia and Dallas police in the conspiracy: (1) Ruby was closely associated with organized crime at the time of the assassination, as evidenced by a large number of suspicious phone calls and meetings with Mafia hit men, greatly accelerated during the months and days preceding the assassination and continuing during the days following. (2) Ruby shot Oswald deliberately, not out of emotion, as evidenced by his own handwritten confession to Joe Tonahill, and the improbability of his being able to shoot Oswald when surrounded by the Dallas police unless the shooting was planned in some detail with their cooperation. The Dallas police had extensive connections with Ruby. (3) Johnny Rosselli told columnist Jack Anderson that Ruby was “one of our boys and had been ordered to kill Oswald.” (4) Ruby was connected to New Orleans mob boss Carlos Marcello through Marcello’s associates in New Orleans. (5) Oswald was connected to Carlos Marcello through his uncle Charles (Dutz) Murret and through David Ferrie. (6) David Ferrie worked for Carlos Marcello as a pilot and consultant, and he also worked for Marcello’s lawyer, G. Wray Gill. (7) Oswald, David Ferrie, and Clay Shaw were seen together in 1963 in Clinton, Louisiana, and at various other locations. (8) Oswald was connected to David Ferrie years previously through the Civil Air Patrol and was seen with David Ferrie by numerous witnesses around New Orleans in the summer of 1963. There are photographs of them together. (9) Clay Shaw was a CIA contract agent, and he also was on the board of directors of Permindex, a right-wing extremist or-ganization—allegedly a CIA company (more on that later). "},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"(10) Money was passed to Oswald by a Marcello lieutenant in early 1963 at about the time that Kennedy’s plan to go to Dallas was made public. (11) Marcello had high-level connections with the CIA, Clint Murchison, Bobby Baker, and Lyndon Johnson. Marcello was directly involved with the CIA, along with Trafficante, in the plots to assassinate Fidel Castro. (12) David Ferrie was associated with ex-FBI agent Guy Banister, whose office was at the same address as the Fair Play for Cuba committee that consisted of one person, Oswald. (13) Carlos Marcello had threatened Kennedy’s assassination in 1962 and described how it would be done, mirroring the way it actually happened. (14) David Ferrie made a trip to Houston, Texas, on the night of the assassination. While in Houston, Ferrie made a telephone call to Marcello’s Town and Country Motel in New Orleans whereby he could have been given a final message to relay to Ruby to eliminate Oswald. (15) David Ferrie died mysteriously just before he was to be indicted by Jim Garrison. (16) The Dallas police falsely pinned the murder of Officer Tippit on Oswald, and the FBI cooperated with them in this subterfuge. The Dallas police had close connections with the Mafia in Dallas. (17) The Dallas police falsified evidence concerning the number of empty shells found on the sixth floor of the School Book Depository, or cooperated with the FBI in falsifying this evidence. (18) Jimmy Hoffa was obsessed with killing Robert Kennedy and was plotting ways to do it in 1962. He sent a message to Santo Trafficante, Jr., and Carlos Marcello that John Kennedy was to be killed. (19) David Ferrie had made statements that Kennedy should be shot. (20) In September 1962, Santo Trafficante, Jr., told José Aleman of a plot to assassinate John Kennedy, saying, “Kennedy is going to be hit,” and described how it would be accomplished. The foregoing list in its totality constitutes a persuasive indictment of organized crime, in collaboration with the Dallas police. Also, the FBI clearly was involved in altering evidence and selectively suppressing other evidence. If we combine this with the evidence of forgery of the Zapruder film, forgery of the autopsy x-rays, and the evidence of the theft of Kennedy’s body and manipulation of the autopsy, we have compelling proof of complicity by the executive branch of the U.S. government—at least in the cover-up. It becomes clear that the Mafia, although enmeshed in the assassination, could not have carried off the extreme manipulations of evidence that took place in Washington, D.C. Also, they could not have continued the suppression of the truth for the many years following, up to the present day, without cooperation at the highest levels in the FBI, the White House, and other powerful interests. This leads to a logical inclusion of J. Edgar Hoover in the cover-up in league with Lyndon Johnson. More evidence relating to the Mafia will be included in the chapters that follow; and evidence implicating the FBI and J. Edgar Hoover and Lyndon Johnson will be more fully developed. But what about the CIA? Was its complicity, at a level higher than that of contract agents such as David Ferrie, a necessary ingredient in the conspiracy or cover-up? Or was its role exaggerated by other participants? This question will be addressed in the following chapter. * * * Epilogue"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":" In the fall of 1995, Anna Marie sent me a copy of an FBI document that she found in the National Archives.

[168] Apparently, what we have here are the mutterings of a senile, aged mobster, perhaps playing out a flashback of his previous experience after he had met with Hoffa’s Provenzano to plan the Kennedy assassination. This adds an ironic touch to the Marcello story. This story becomes even more interesting when we discover that Tony Provenzano was the one who had $500,000 delivered to Richard Nixon in exchange for favors to Teamsters Union President Frank Fitzsimmons, to help Nixon in the Watergate affair when he had an urgent need for $1,000,000 of hush money to bribe an ex-CIA officer, E.

A thesis of this book is that these contradictory purposes were one of the causes of the JFK assassination. Overlaid on this will be the complexities of the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban missile crisis, and how these events may have contributed to John Kennedy’s murder. Before examining details of the evidence relating to the CIA, I sketched a quick overview of the key events of the Kennedy assassination that appear to be CIA or Mafia connected.

Kennedy had known about the plans for the Bay of Pigs before he was elected to the presidency. It is generally acknowledged that he was tipped off about these plans during the 1960 campaign and that he used this information against Richard Nixon during the debates by pushing for aggressive action against Castro, knowing that Nixon couldn’t respond without giving away the secret. The ill-fated Bay of Pigs scheme originated under Eisenhower; it was the pet project of Allen Dulles, director of the CIA. The project manager was Richard Bissell, Dulles’ deputy director. After being elected and having several meetings with top people in the CIA and the military, Kennedy approved the plan, which included major revisions proposed by the Department of State regarding the landing site, the timing, and the extent of preparatory air strikes. Kennedy’s decision to go ahead relied in part on the CIA’s foolish notion that it could be a completely covert operation— that it would not be recognized by the outside world as connected with the United States. Thus, on April 17, 1961, the CIA launched the poorly conceived and badly planned invasion of Cuba, using only a small band of Cuban exiles who were directed by CIA officers and U.S. military specialists. The plan was based on the supposition that the invasion would trigger an uprising in Cuba, and that Castro would be overthrown by the Cuban populace. That is what the CIA told Kennedy would happen. But it didn’t. At the last moment, when things started going wrong, the CIA asked for U.S. air strikes. But Kennedy refused. Conceivably, the air strikes might have made the invasion successful, at least for the establishment of a strong beachhead. It all turned out to be a total disaster. Many Cuban exiles were slaughtered; embitterment of the CIA and the Cuban exiles against Kennedy began; and Kennedy was tarnished with the reputation of being spineless and a traitor to the CIA and the anti-Castro Cubans. In the fall of 1994 I had the opportunity to converse with two people who were involved at both ends of the spectrum of the Bay of Pigs operation. One was an ex-Navy frogman (at whose request I identify by alias Jim Lance ) who participated in the invasion. Lance was one of six frogmen who went ashore to reconnoiter the beachhead and then witnessed the debacle that followed from aboard a ship off the beach. On the opposite end of the spectrum was Robert McNamara, secretary of defense in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. McNamara was with Kennedy at the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion when the decision was made not to provide additional air support when it was requested. [170] Based on my discussions with McNamara and Lance, one can see the Bay of Pigs operation as a classic example of tragically different perceptions—at the level of the president and at the scene of battle. From the viewpoint of McNamara and Kennedy, they had little or no choice after Kennedy was elected but to proceed with virtually irreversible plans already underway. Hundreds of Cubans were in place, having been trained for months in Guatemala. The logistics had been worked out. Everything was set to go and could not be delayed without danger of the cover being blown through the news media. In fact, the New York Times had already reported stories of an imminent invasion of Cuba. And, unbeknownst to Kennedy and McNamara, Castro’s agents had infiltrated the operation and knew much of what was supposed to happen. The Cubans were ready and waiting for the invasion. Although not expressed to me by McNamara, it seems probable that if Kennedy had canceled the entire operation before the invasion he would have been politically devastated by the Republican party, particularly in view of Kennedy having made a political issue of the lack of action against Castro under the Eisenhower administration. And Kennedy would have been branded even more cowardly by the"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Cuban exile community and the ultraconservatives in the U.S. From the viewpoint of the Cuban exiles and U.S. intelligence operatives at the beachhead, Kennedy had betrayed them. According to McNamara, a key point is that Kennedy had never promised the U.S. air strikes in the first place and had been badly misled by the CIA in its bungled planning. Kennedy was caught in a no- win situation. Looking at both perspectives, it seems that Kennedy and McNamara probably made the courageous and correct decision by refusing to provide direct U.S. air cover. The alternative would likely have escalated to a major invasion of Cuba by U.S. military forces, with probable loss of American lives in the scores of thousands, and many more thousands of Cuban lives lost. In fact, at that time Castro had the overwhelming support of the Cuban people; they were prepared to fight to the end. [171] Moreover, an invasion of Cuba by the United States could well have precipitated a crisis of grave and unpredictable consequences with the Soviet Union in Europe, particularly in relation to Berlin. Jim Lance told me that when the air support was “called off,” all other support was cut off, including supplies for the forces ashore. Again, this was probably Lance’s misconception, because supplies could have been interrupted due to other logistical failures. McNamara told me that he knew nothing about supplies having been deliberately cut off. Lance said that CIA and military personnel in the invasion support forces were almost universally outraged with Kennedy, and there was much talk that “Kennedy ought to be killed for this.” This talk, Lance said, went through all the ranks—from enlisted men to high-ranking officers. Feelings of hatred and utter disrespect for Kennedy, shared among Cuban exiles and CIA personnel in Florida, are seen by many researchers as having been an incendiary critical mass that laid the groundwork for the assassination of John Kennedy two and one-half years later. [172] From the foregoing, it seems that John Kennedy should not have been blamed for the Bay of Pigs failure. However, for purposes of our study, that does not matter. He was blamed, with great anger and bitterness. My feeling at this point is that the Bay of Pigs fiasco did in fact enable the Mafia and other prime conspirators to recruit some of the angry CIA personnel to join in the plot. And, of course, we can suspect that money flowing from the Mafia, and their wealthy allies, to radical CIA personnel and angry anti-Castro Cubans could have been employed as an added inducement. Following the Bay of Pigs failure, Kennedy went on national television to state that he accepted full responsibility for the debacle. But he then proceeded to fire two of the top men of the CIA—Allen Dulles and Richard Bissell. Kennedy waited only one month before informing Dulles and Bissell that they had to go. Next in line, General Cabell, deputy director of operations, was fired seven months later, after Kennedy assumed (incorrectly) that Cabell had leaked information from a White House meeting. At the time he fired Dulles, Kennedy put his thirty-five-year-old brother Robert in unofficial control of CIA covert operations, notwithstanding the fact that Robert knew virtually nothing about it. He also let it be known that the CIA was going to be dismantled. There was good reason to believe that many key people in the CIA took Kennedy seriously; their survival as an organization was being threatened, and Kennedy had already carried out the first steps by firing the leaders. John Kennedy must have had no idea of how serious his precipitous actions might become. He had fired Allen Dulles and other top CIA officials and operatives, threatening the very existence of the organization for making one major mistake. Dulles was a truly deserving national hero for his accomplishments in the OSS (the forerunner of the CIA) while he was an agent in Europe during World War II, and in other accomplishments in CIA covert actions— then unknown to the public. For example, Dulles was the mastermind behind the successful coup in Iran, orchestrated by CIA’s Kermit Roosevelt,"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"with its brilliant short-term results, albeit arguably disastrous long-term consequences. [173] Dulles, as much as any individual, was father of the CIA. It was Dulles who gave the CIA its character—good and bad—and infused it with his ideas and experiences in the field. Dulles had built the CIA with loyal followers: Charles Cabell had been his deputy director as long as Dulles had been with the CIA. Richard Helms, who later would become director of covert operations at the time Kennedy was assassinated, was Dulles’s protégé. Dulles was the CIA. He was now being replaced by John McCone, a Republican business executive and anti-Communist from California. When Robert Kennedy was given unofficial control of covert operations, he immediately tangled horns with William Harvey. Harvey was in charge of CIA assassination operations (the ZR/ RIFLE program) and was in charge of the covert program (Project Mongoose) for the overthrow of Castro. Harvey was a wild-tempered, whiskey-drinking, extreme character. Harvey, like Dulles, was a legend, having been responsible for the exposure of the Burgess-McLean spy ring in British intelligence and having masterminded the Berlin tunnel project between East and West Berlin. Harvey viewed Robert Kennedy with utter contempt. In January 1963, Robert Kennedy, disgusted with Harvey, reassigned him to a post in Rome as chief of station—a major comedown. At the same time that Robert Kennedy was put in control of covert operations for the CIA, he unleashed his first attack on the Mafia. On April 4, 1961, the attorney general had Carlos Marcello seized, spirited to an airplane without being allowed to talk to his family, and flown to Guatemala where he was dumped without luggage and with little cash. Robert Kennedy simultaneously went after his arch-enemy, Jimmy Hoffa. He organized a “get Hoffa squad” in the Justice Department and demanded that J. Edgar Hoover step up the prosecution of organized crime. The first ominous evidence we have of Hoffa’s reaction is when he started recruiting an assassin to take care of Bobby Kennedy. In July/August 1962, Hoffa passed the word to Santo Trafficante and Carlos Marcello, through his attorney Frank Ragano, that John Kennedy must be killed. It was in September 1962, shortly after Hoffa’s threats and message, that Marcello uttered his famous JFK death threat in the presence of Ed Becker. At the same time, Trafficante told Aleman that JFK would be hit. This occurred at the beginning of the Cuban missile crisis, the first signs of which began in August 1962 [174] and ended about twelve weeks later. The Cuban missile crisis was defused when Kennedy agreed to remove U.S. nuclear missiles from Turkey and Italy and not to invade Cuba. When this got out to the Cuban exiles and the CIA, it was viewed as further betrayal by Kennedy. The crisis between Kennedy and some of the renegade operatives in the CIA, and the radical Cuban exiles, had now reached a point of no return. Santo Trafficante shared the feelings and motivations of the Cuban exiles with a passion. He had been badly burned in Havana when Castro made a deal with him for his operation of five lucrative gambling casinos, only to see them quickly run into bankruptcy because all the people with money to gamble had either been exiled, forced underground, or not permitted to come to Cuba. When the casinos were shut down, Castro threw Trafficante into prison. Castro later relented and let Trafficante return to the U.S., but Trafficante and the Mafia never gave up their desire to recapture their lucrative operations in Havana. This motivation was shared with many wealthy Cuban exiles then in Florida. Together, they formed a very powerful group largely bearing a combined hatred for both Kennedy and Castro. Throwing gasoline on the fire, Kennedy started shutting down U.S. anti-Castro operations except for a few specific covert operations sponsored by Robert Kennedy in the JM/WAVE segment. At that point, hope of Castro being thrown out as long as the Kennedys were in power had all but vanished for many of the anti-Castro Cubans, particularly the radical right-wing Cubans who were not favored by the Kennedys and who were in competition with the left-wing, anti-Castro Cubans whom the Kennedys supported. During the Cuban missile crisis William Harvey took it upon himself to assemble a covert action team of commandos and send them into Cuba. This occurred at the height of the most crucial negotiations. When"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"the Kennedys found out about this, Harvey was assigned to Rome, presumably forever. Nonetheless, he showed up in the spring, summer, and fall of 1963 in ominous meetings in the Florida Keys at anti-Castro camps with Johnny Rosselli, David Atlee Phillips, and a CIA assassination expert by the name of David Sanchez Morales. Shortly after that, Rosselli met with Guy Banister in New Orleans, and Phillips met with Oswald in Dallas. As will be discussed later, many respected researchers now believe William Harvey may have been the chief planner of Kennedy’s assassination, working with the CIA’s David Atlee Phillips and David Morales and the Mafia’s Johnny Rosselli, using recruits from the French Mafia whom Harvey contacted while in Italy. In early November 1963, Joseph Milteer told an FBI informant that Kennedy would be killed by rifle fire; this was only a few days before Kennedy was assassinated. It is interesting to observe how rapidly all these initial, irreversible events took place. Within only four months after taking office, the youthful Kennedy brothers went on what now could justifiably be described as a reckless rampage by attacking a cabal of powerful, ruthless men who were partners in crime, had virtually unlimited resources, and were capable of committing any heinous act. It appears that initial serious plans to assassinate John Kennedy began to form in the spring or summer of 1962 in retaliation for the Kennedy brothers’ actions. Oswald returned from Russia on June 13, 1962. The assassination plans were put into action and culminated about a year later at Dealey Plaza. What does the foregoing tell us? It reveals a unique sequence of events and a singular combination of people and circumstances , with actions initiated by the Kennedy brothers that could plausibly have led to the assassination. It is possible that certain angry, threatened employees or ex-employees of the CIA and angry, threatened Mafia chieftains and Cuban exiles got together, perhaps through their underlings, and decided to commit the crime of the century. As earlier noted, they all were natural allies with the extreme right wing and with J. Edgar Hoover and Lyndon Johnson. I will now examine specific evidence to support this hypothesis insofar as it involves the CIA. In subsequent chapters, I will attempt to arrive at an understanding of the possible combined roles of the CIA, Oswald, military intelligence, the military, the Cuban exiles, and right-wing extremists in the Kennedy assassination. Thousands of scholars have spent hundreds of thousands of hours in such attempts. I hope that I will not become engulfed in the morass and endless blind alleys that have bedeviled others before me.

Gaeton Fonzi Former Investigator for the HSCA 17 TWO OSWALDS IN DALLAS We will now examine evidence of an Oswald impersonator in Dallas in the months preceding the Kennedy assassination. The first question is why would the plotters have taken the elaborate steps necessary to create an Oswald impersonator? The answer could be that the real Oswald was a patsy, and the plotters felt that they had to lay down a trail of evidence—before the assassination—that pointed unmistakably to Oswald. I will begin my analysis on that premise and see how it unfolds. Our first development of evidence of an Oswald impersonator will concentrate on three episodes. A chronology of the activities of Oswald and his alleged impersonators during the sixty days prior to the assassination is shown in Exhibit 17-1. Most of the information is from the Warren Commission, which did a very thorough job on the details of this subject, although the results, being inconvenient to their goal of creating a story of a lone assassin, were largely dismissed. Exhibit 17-1. Oswald’s Activities During the Sixty Days Prior to the Assassination. September 25: Cashed unemployment check in New Orleans.

If"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"there were an impersonator, we have strong evidence of a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy and the inference that the plotters were trying to set up Oswald. An example of an Oswald impersonator occurred on November 10, 1963 when a man resembling Oswald was observed by Garland G. Slack practicing at a rifle range in Dallas. The Rifle Range Incidents An FBI document in the Warren Commission Report noted: ....It should be noted in the interview of Mr. Garland G. Slack on December 1, 1963, which is recorded in the report of Special Agent Robert P. Gemberling at Dallas, dated December 10, 1963, pages 236-238, that Mr. Slack furnished information to the effect that he had seen a man believed to be identical with Oswald at the Sports Drome Rifle Range on November 10, 1963, and believed that he was accompanied by another described as tall, having a lot of dark hair, dark complexion, and a full beard. [175] (Emphasis added) Slack’s testimony was corroborated in part by Malcolm H. Price, who testified that he had adjusted the rifle scope for a person on September 28, 1963 whom he believed to have been Lee Harvey Oswald. In Price’s testimony to the Warren Commission: MR. LIEBELER. The Commission has information to the effect that sometime during November 1963, you saw a gentleman at the rifle range whom you subsequently came to believe was Lee Harvey Oswald ; is that correct ? MR. PRICE. That’s right . The first time that I saw this person was in September, the last week —the last Saturday of September, and that was the afternoon that they opened the rifle range. MR. LIEBELER. On the last Saturday of September? MR. PRICE. Yes. MR. LIEBELER. That would be September 28? MR. PRICE. Yes. [176] (Emphasis added) Price went on to testify that he had seen this man on several other occasions practicing at the rifle range. He said he recalled seeing this customer on four or five occasions and on each occasion he wore a “bulldogger, Texas style” hat and had bubble gum or chewing tobacco in his cheek. He said he was very well dressed, clean and neat, 5’8\" tall, 140—150 pounds, hair dark blond or light brown. [177] The Commission noted that there was corroboration of these testimonies: The witnesses who claimed to have seen Oswald at the firing range had more than a passing notice of the person they observed. Malcolm H. Price, Jr., adjusted the scope on the individual’s rifle on one occasion; Garland G. Slack had an altercation with the individual on another occasion because he was shooting at Slack’s target ; and Sterling C. Wood, who on a third date was present at the range with his father, Dr. Homer Wood, spoke with his father and very briefly with the man himself about the individual’s rifle. A l l three of these persons, as well as Dr. Wood, expressed confidence that the man they saw was Oswald . Two other persons believed they saw a person resembling Oswald firing a similar rifle at another range near Irving two days before the"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"assassination. [178] (Emphasis added) The problem with the September 28 and November 10 incidents is that the person identified as Oswald could not have been Oswald; the reasoning being that Oswald was, according to the Warren Commission, indisputably in Mexico City on September 28, ostensibly visiting the Cuban and Soviet consulates, and was visiting his wife continuously at the Paine’s home in Irving, Texas, between November 8 and 11. [179] The Warren Commission used that as a reason to discredit the testimonies! The Commission simply did not consider that the person resembling Oswald was an impersonator. They were looking for a lone assassin, not an impersonator The Lincoln Mercury Automobile Incident Albert Bogard, an auto salesman at a Lincoln-Mercury auto dealership in Dallas near the Texas Schoolbook Depository building, testified to the Warren Commission that in the early afternoon of November 9 he met with a prospective customer who went with him on a wild test drive of a new Lincoln Continental automobile on the Stemmons Freeway at sixty to seventy miles per hour. The customer told him that in several weeks he would have the money to purchase the automobile. Bogard testified that the customer gave his name as “Oswald,” which Bogard wrote down on the back of a business card. After Oswald’s name was mentioned on the radio on November 22, Bogard asserted that he tore up the card and threw it in the trash can, saying that he supposed Oswald would no longer wish to buy a car. Bogard’s testimony [180] was described in the Warren Commission Report: Bogard’s testimony has received corroboration . The assistant sales manager at the time, Frank Pizzo, and a second salesman, Eugene M. Wilson, stated that they recall an instance when the customer described by Bogard was in the showroom. Another salesman, Oran Brown, recalled that Bogard asked him to assist the customer if he appeared during certain evenings when Bogard was away from the showroom. Brown stated that he too wrote down the customer’s name and both he and his wife remember the name “Oswald” as being on a paper in his possession before the assassination. [181] (Emphasis added) Bogard’s testimony was also corroborated in a lie-detector test conducted by the FBI. [182] As noted, the real Oswald was in Irving, Texas, on November 9. A corroborating witness remembered the man attempting to purchase the car on credit, instead of cash, and when he was told that he might be unable to do so without a credit rating he replied, “Maybe I’m going to have to go back to Russia to buy a car”— indicating that the man was trying to attract attention to himself as a Communist nut. Upon examining photographs of Oswald, witnesses who were at the agency said that the man they saw resembled Oswald, although there were differences in one witness’s testimony, who said that the man who had identified himself as Oswald was only about five feet tall and his hairline did not match Oswald’s in the photograph. Of course the Commission could have viewed this as evidence that he was an imperfect impostor using Oswald’s name, yet they chose to conclude merely that the man wasn’t Oswald, ignoring the obvious. A further example of the fallacious reasoning of the Commission is that they concluded that because"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Oswald was in Irving at the time of the incident, it was evidence that the man at the dealership could not have been Oswald. The Commission also cited the fact that Oswald could not drive a car (he was learning at the time), as evidence that this was not Oswald. Of course he wasn’t Oswald; The Warren Commission ignored that this could be evidence that the man was an impersonator of Oswald! The Commission went on to say that it could not find the piece of paper with the name Oswald on it on November 23 after a search through the auto agency and its refuse. Therefore, the Commission concluded, the testimonies of Bogard and the corroborating witness Oran Brown [183] were suspect, despite the fact that Brown’s wife corroborated his testimony. The Mysterious Visit to Silvia Odio Another incident perhaps indicating two Oswalds, and definitely that Oswald was being set up in a conspiracy, has to do with Cuban exile Silvia Odio, who had a very strange visit on an evening sometime between September 24 and 29, 1963. She testified in a deposition to the Warren Commission that late in September 1963 three men came to her apartment in Dallas and asked her to help them solicit funds for activities against Fidel Castro. Odio, twenty-six years old at the time, was a member of the Cuban Revolutionary Junta (JURE), an anti-Castro organization. She came from a prominent, wealthy family in Cuba and both of her parents were prisoners of Castro. She testified that the men exhibited personal familiarity with her father, telling several details about him, and they appeared to be Cubans or Mexicans. She said that two of the men identified themselves by their fictitious underground “war names.” She remembered that one of them called himself “Leopoldo,” the other, “Angel.” The third man was introduced to Odio as Leon Oswald . Odio was told that Oswald was very much interested in the Cuban cause. She then gave the following electrifying statements. Mrs. Odio said that the men told her that they had just come from New Orleans and that they were then about to leave on a trip. Mrs. Odio testified that the next day Leopoldo called her on the telephone and told her that it was his idea to introduce the American into the underground “ because he is great, he is kind of nuts.” Leopoldo also said that the American had been in the Marine Corps and was an excellent shot, and that the American said the Cubans “don’t have any guts...because President Kennedy should have been assassinated after the Bay of Pigs, and some Cubans should have done that, because he was the one that was holding the freedom of Cuba actually .” Although Mrs. Odio suggested doubts that the men were in fact members of JURE, she was certain that the American who was introduced to her as Leon Oswald was Lee Harvey Oswald. Her sister, who was in the apartment at the time of the visit by the three men, and who stated that she saw them briefly in the hallway when answering the door, also believed that the American was Lee Harvey Oswald . By referring to the date on which she moved from her former apartment, October 1, 1963, Mrs. Odio fixed the date of the alleged visit on the Thursday or Friday immediately preceding that date, i.e., September 26 or 27. She was positive that the visit occurred prior to October 1 [184] (Emphasis added)"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Silvia Odio, Cuban exile from a prominent, wealthy Cuban family, is an important witness in the Kennedy assassination. She testified to the Warren Commission that Oswald and two others (who appeared to be Cubans or Mexicans), one of whom called himself Leopoldo, visited her home in Dallas on or about September 25, 1963. She said that in a telephone call the next day, Leopoldo told her it was his idea to introduce the American into the underground “because he is great, he is kind of nuts.” Leopoldo also said that the American had been in the Marine Corps and was an excellent shot, and that the American said the Cubans “ ’don’t have any guts’ ” because “ ’President Kennedy should have been assassinated after the Bay of Pigs, and some Cubans should have done that because he was the one that was holding the freedom of Cuba actually.’ ” Odio wrote a letter to her father about this and also told her psychiatrist before the assassination, and both corroborated her story. Of relevance, the FBI only found out about her story inadvertently. Silvia and her sister Annie, who witnessed the event, had decided not to tell anyone about it. But a trusted friend, Lucille Connell, learned about it through a third sister, Sorita, and told another trusted friend. (Fonzi, p. 108-113) Soon the FBI contacted Silvia Odio. Her character and truthfulness were confirmed by the FBI. This is evidence of Oswald being involved in or maneuvered into a conspiracy. Despite a major effort, the Warren Commission and the FBI were never able to discredit Odio’s testimony, and the identities of the two men accompanying the man they called Oswald have never been established. Photo Source: Assassination Archives It should be noted that although the above statement from the Commission Report says that the men visited her on September 26 or 27, Odio was not positive of the date except that it was in late September and before October. [185] The Commission’s reaction to Odio’s testimony was to request an investigation by the FBI to identify and locate the two men whom Odio stated accompanied Oswald. On September 16, 1964 the FBI came up with a Loran Eugene Hall (also known as Lorenzo Pascillo) in Johnsondale, California, who “told the FBI that in September 1963, he was in Dallas, soliciting aid in connection with anti-Castro activities. He said he had visited Mrs. Odio.” He told the FBI that he was accompanied by a Lawrence Howard and a William Seymour. He said that “Seymour was similar in appearance to Oswald; he speaks only a few words of Spanish,” as Odio had testified that one of the men did. [186] The foregoing information was"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"submitted by the FBI to the Commission in a letter dated September 21, 1964, which had the effect of explaining Odio’s story without implicating Oswald. The Commission Report was published on September 24, 1964. But within a week, the other two men whom Hall said had accompanied him (Howard and Seymour) were interviewed. They denied ever having met Silvia Odio. Later, Hall himself retracted his statement. [187] Odio’s story remained intact but it was too late for the Commission’s report. The Odio problem had been finessed by the FBI, but it left open the mystery of who, in fact, was the man introduced as Oswald, and the identities of the two men who accompanied him. The Commission published its report with the following: While the FBI had not yet completed its investigation into this matter at the time the report went to press, the Commission has concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald was not at Mrs. Odio’s apartment in September of 1963. [188] Not only had the FBI failed to give the Commission its information on time, the Commission had proceeded to reach a conclusion without the FBI having completed its investigation (insofar as the Commission knew) and the Commission had so stated in its report. Thus, the Commission had flagrantly ducked a most important item of evidence of a conspiracy. It does not take a suspicious mind to conclude that the FBI had deliberately delayed investigating the Silvia Odio story—which was powerful evidence of a conspiracy—until the information would not have to be submitted in time for the Warren Commission to use it. Later information would connect Loran Hall with Lawrence Howard and Gerald Patrick Hemming, all three deeply involved in the radical right-wing, and suspects in the JFK murder. If the Commission had not allowed the FBI to manipulate it, a conspiracy might have been revealed. (See photo in Chapter 28 of CIA-sponsored group that trained assassins at No Name Key, Florida.) What made the Odio evidence so believable is not only Silvia Odio’s credibility (she was thoroughly checked out by the FBI and found to be very credible) but the fact that, shortly after the incident, she wrote a letter to her father in prison in Cuba and related the incident to him. She also told her psychiatrist about it. Both her father and the psychiatrist confirmed that she informed them of the incident before John Kennedy was assassinated . Moreover, her sister Annie was the one who opened the door when the strangers arrived, and she confirmed Silvia’s story and also recognized Oswald as being one of the three strangers. [189] , [190] Silvia Odio’s father, Amador Odio, responded to her letter warning her to be careful because he knew of no one in JURE whom these people might be. This has led to the suspicion that the two Cuban visitors accompanying Oswald were members of another anti-Castro group called Alpha 66. This group was on the extreme right and was involved in the efforts of the CIA and the Mafia to assassinate Castro. The JURE group was considered to be leftists or Communists who wanted to get rid of Castro but would maintain some sort of social democracy in Cuba. This raised the suspicion that the right-wing group was implementing a scheme to link JURE, the left-wing group, with the assassination. [191] The founder of Alpha 66 was Antonio Veciana, who later testified to the House Committee on Assassinations that he had met Oswald along with a Maurice Bishop in Dallas in late August or early September 1963. Maurice Bishop, as will be discussed at length later, was a code name for a CIA operative who was believed to be Oswald’s control agent. Maurice Bishop was also Antonio Veciana’s contact with the CIA. Amador Odio was connected to Veciana by the fact that Odio had been in prison because he had helped and harbored an anti-Castro plotter called Renaldo Gonzales who, in a conspiracy with Veciana, had plotted to kill Fidel Castro. [192]"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"The evidence of the two Cubans and a man calling himself Oswald visiting Odio’s apartment about two months before the assassination of John Kennedy is very convincing. It is evidence of the likelihood of a conspiracy involving Oswald with Cubans who professed to be members of a leftist, anti-Castro organization. It proved to be impossible for the FBI or the Warren Commission to build even a flimsy case to refute it. Years later, the House Committee on Assassinations conducted another investigation of Odio’s testimony, concluding that it was credible and “there is a strong probability that one of the men was or appeared to be Lee Harvey Oswald.” [193] What does this evidence tell us? First, we should keep in mind that Odio testified it was not Oswald who said that President Kennedy should have been assassinated. It was one of the Cubans—not speaking in the presence of Oswald—who telephoned Odio later and planted the idea in her mind. Leopoldo called Odio after leaving her apartment. If the Oswald who was visiting Odio with the Cubans were a witting impostor, Leopoldo would more likely have made his statement in front of “Oswald” and not bothered to telephone later. Is it possible that the person visiting Odio’s apartment was the real Oswald? Oswald’s whereabouts at the time of the visit to Odio’s apartment are shown in Exhibits 17-2 and 17-3. It is known with a high degree of certainty that Oswald was in New Orleans until the morning of September 25 when he cashed an unemployment check at a store in New Orleans. The store at which he cashed the checks did not open until 8:00 a.m. It was thus established that Oswald could not have left New Orleans before 8:00 a.m. on September 25. Another point at which Oswald’s location is picked up is in Houston, Texas, where at 2:35 a.m. he boarded a Continental Trailways bus headed through Alice, Texas, and Laredo, Texas, to Mexico City. The reason it is believed that Oswald was on the bus is that he was observed sitting alone at 6:00 a.m., before the bus reached Alice, by two English passengers, Dr. and Mrs. John McFarland, shortly after the McFarlands awakened at 6:00 a.m. Later in the bus trip, Oswald was very talkative with passengers on the bus, attracting attention to himself and talking about having just returned from Russia. Oswald crossed the border into Mexico before 2:00 p.m. on September 26; this was firmly established by Mexican immigration records. He arrived in Mexico City at 10:00 a.m. on September 27. Therefore, the time not accounted for is between 8:00 a.m. on September 25, and 2:35 a.m. on September 26—a period of about eighteen hours. During this period, Oswald could have been driven [194] or flown from New Orleans to Dallas, visited Odio on the evening of September 25, and then been driven or flown to Houston in time to make the bus connection to Mexico City at 2:35 a.m. on September 26. He could not have visited Odio on the evening of September 26 or any later date until he returned to Dallas on October 3. Exhibit 17-2. Oswald’s Activities from New Orleans to Mexico City .

If Oswald did not go by bus from New Orleans to Houston, he could have traveled from Dallas to Alice, Texas, and caught the bus that left Houston at 2:35 am, but he could not have been on the bus at 6:00 am when seen by the McFarlands, and no tickets were sold during the period of September 23 to 26. The Warren Commission concluded that Oswald was not in Dallas on September 25, 26, or 27, and that he stayed in Mexico City until returning to Dallas on October 3. So, if it were September 25 when Oswald and the two Cubans visited Odio, it could have been the same Oswald who went to Mexico City on the bus from Houston. Recall that Odio had fixed the date that the three men visited her as being between September 24 and 29. The Warren Commission Report had perhaps inadvertently put the date at September 26 or 27. The Warren Commission investigators determined that there was no indication that Oswald had flown by commercial airlines from New Orleans to Dallas, or Dallas to Houston. They also determined that no bus tickets had been sold by Continental Trailways between Dallas and Houston during the period September 23 to 26. Continental Trailways was the only bus line on which Oswald could have made connections to the bus leaving Houston for Mexico City at 2:35 a.m. on September 26."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Exhibit 17-3. Oswald’s Trip to Mexico: New Orleans via Beaumont, Houston, Alice, and Laredo, with Possible Side Trip to Dallas and Austin. The Warren Commission concluded that Oswald most likely boarded a bus in New Orleans at 12:50 p.m. on September 25 that arrived in Houston in time to make the connection to Laredo and Mexico City. In fact, Oswald told passengers on the bus from Houston to Laredo that he had done just that, although of course it is possible that he was not telling the truth. The Commission did not seriously consider that it was possible for Oswald to have gone from New Orleans to Dallas, visited Odio, and then made the bus connection in Houston, if he had been driven or flown by an accomplice along the legs of the journey. It should be noted that he was in fact with two accomplices when he visited Odio. And all three were traveling in a car. A question is: Was Oswald driven from New Orleans to Dallas with the two accomplices, or did all three of them travel together by plane to Dallas, and then obtain a car to drive to Odio’s apartment? To narrow down the possibilities of Oswald’s transportation, there is an additional item of very strong evidence that Oswald could not have been driven in a car but was flown by private or military aircraft on his journey (then traveling from a private airfield in a car to Mrs. Odio’s home). There is credible testimony that Oswald was interviewed at a Selective Service office in Austin, Texas, on September 25, between 1:05 p.m. and 1:35 p.m. Referring to Exhibit 17-3, it can be seen that Oswald could not have been driven from New Orleans, leaving at 8:00 a.m. and arriving in Austin at 1:05 p.m. because the driving distance is 542 miles . He and his driver would have had to average about 80 miles per hour to make the journey. Therefore, he would have had to travel by air in a private or military plane. The evidence that Oswald was in Austin, Texas, is compelling. It is reported in an FBI report dated December 30, 1963. The FBI reported that it had received a memorandum prepared by Mrs. Lee Dannelly, assistant chief of the state selective service headquarters at Austin, Texas, concerning her recollection of a contact with Oswald at her office in Austin, in which he was seeking to “straighten out his discharge from the Marine Corps, which had been under other than honorable conditions.” The very detailed FBI report stated that Mrs. Dannelly was of the firm belief that the date on which Oswald contacted her was September 25, 1963, based on her habit of going to the bank during lunch"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"break on every other Wednesday, which was payday. She said she recalls returning from the bank about 1:00 p.m. to 1:05 p.m. on that day (when she first saw Oswald). The report also stated that Mrs. Dannelly identified Oswald in a photograph shown to her. She said it looked like the man who came to her office. [195] The evidence of Oswald being in both Austin and Dallas is very important. If we take both instances as being true, it is inescapable that Oswald was being flown around Texas in a whirlwind series of meetings on September 25, 1963 in which his name was clearly put forth and which tied him in one instance to being a potential threat to Governor Connally (the Austin incident) and the other to a leftist division of anti-Castro Cubans. This suggests either a serious blunder on the part of the conspirators or a deliberate staging to link Oswald in a conspiracy—not a lone nut—because the conspirators must have realized that future investigations would reveal the impossibility of Oswald being in all of these places unless he had accomplices to fly him. In summary, of the three cases of possible Oswald impersonators studied in this chapter, two indicate an impersonator: the rifle-range incidents and the Lincoln-Mercury incident. Of these two, the Lincoln- Mercury incident is the strongest evidence in that corroborating witnesses testified that the man identified himself as Oswald, when, in fact, Oswald was visiting with his wife in Irving, Texas, at that time and could not have been the man at the Lincoln-Mercury agency. The rifle-range incidents, although significant, depend solely on eyewitness identification of an Oswald “look-alike,” without the person having identified himself as Oswald, and are therefore the weaker evidence. The Silvia Odio incident, in any scenario, is powerful evidence of a conspiracy: If it were the real Oswald, he had accomplices who flew him from New Orleans to Austin to Dallas, then back to Houston. These accomplices set him up by telling Odio that he was a nut who could kill Kennedy. If it were an Oswald impersonator, it still was a conspiracy setting up Oswald. In either case, it does not seem to show Oswald as a lone nut without accomplices, as was later portrayed by the Warren Commission. A pattern is emerging that the conspirators never intended for the assassination to appear to be the act of a lone gunman without accomplices. Rather, the lone gunman idea was a creation of the Warren Commission, after the fact."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"But CIA people working on the KGB would certainly want to talk to Oswald because if Oswald had defected to the Soviets... it would be to the KGB that he would tell all these matters. And the CIA would want to know, they would have hundreds of questions for him.... Former CIA Secret Operations Officer Phillip Agee Interview by HSCA, 1978, National Archives 18 OSWALD AS A SECRET AGENT It will be helpful to list first some of the reasons, known at the time of the Warren Report, to suspect that Oswald was connected to the CIA or possibly to U.S. military intelligence: 1) A miniature camera, a set of binoculars, and other equipment were found in his possession. The camera was a Minox which was used almost exclusively at that time for spy work, both for the Soviets and U.S. intelligence. 2) Reference to “microdots” in his notes; this espionage term was not commonly known to the general public in 1963. 3) The extreme ease and speed with which he left the U.S. and entered Russia; also his Russian wife Marina’s swift approval for coming to the U.S. and the attendant flagrant bypassing of passport procedures—not only when Oswald went to Russia but when he returned and subsequently easily obtained a passport to travel to Mexico City. 4) Oswald’s relationship to a CIA contact (and ex-Nazi), George de Mohrenschildt, who was his “baby sitter” and who secretly debriefed him when he returned to Fort Worth. (De Mohrenschildt later committed suicide just before he was to be questioned by Gaeton Fonzi, investigator for the HSCA.) 5) The strange absence of official CIA debriefing when Oswald returned from Russia. The CIA maintained that it did not have CIA-generated material in the standard 201 file on Oswald and had not been interested in him, despite the fact that he had defected to the Soviet Union with top- secret knowledge of the U-2 flights over Russia. 6) Oswald’s proficiency with the Russian language, suggesting that he must have had secret training while in the Marine Corps. Oswald spoke Russian so fluently that when his wife Marina first met him she thought he was a Russian citizen. 7) The fact that the so-called traitor Oswald was employed for a short period after his return from Russia by a private contractor doing top-secret photographic work for the U.S. government: Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall, Inc., in Dallas. 8) Oswald’s meeting with CIA officer David Atlee Phillips (a.k.a. Maurice Bishop) and a CIA contract agent and radical anti-Castro Cuban exile, Antonio Veciana, in Dallas in September 1963. 9) The fact that there were names of military intelligence personnel in Oswald’s address book. 10) The fact that Oswald’s name was not in the FBI list of dangerous persons in the Dallas-Fort Worth area at the time of the JFK assassination, despite his having been under almost constant surveillance by the FBI for years, up to within a few weeks of the assassination, and that he was known as a radical Communist who had defected from the Marine Corps and had passed high- level military secrets to the enemy. Of the hundreds of books written on the Kennedy assassination, about half of the material has dealt with Oswald. Norman Mailer published his book Oswald’s Tale, an 800-page volume dealing almost exclusively with Oswald. David Lifton has been working night and day, seven days a week, for the past"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"seven years on an exhaustive book about Oswald. I cannot hope to cover in detail even a small portion of what is known about Oswald. Rather, I will focus on what I consider to be the most important information and how that fits into the overall scope of my thesis. To begin, there is evidence that Oswald was recruited into military intelligence while he was in the Marine Corps in 1957, at Atsugi Air Force Base in Japan, as part of a program to send young military men posing as defectors into the Soviet Union. This program was described by Victor Marchetti, who resigned from the CIA in 1969, disillusioned with the agency after fourteen years of service. Marchetti had been a staff officer in the office of the director of the CIA and an executive assistant to the deputy director. Marchetti co-authored a book, The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence, and has appeared on national television in numerous programs, candidly stating his views of the CIA. Marchetti said: At the time, in 1959, the United States was having real difficulty in acquiring information out of the Soviet Union; technical systems had, of course, not developed to the point that they are at today, and we were resorting to all sorts of activities. One of these activities was an ONI (Office of Naval Intelligence) program which involved three dozen, maybe forty young men who were made to appear disenchanted, poor, American youths who had become turned off and wanted to see what communism was all about. Some of these people lasted only a few weeks. They were sent into the Soviet Union, or into Eastern Europe, with the specific intention the Soviets would pick them up and “double” them if they suspected them of being U.S. agents, or recruit them as KGB agents. They were trained at various naval installations both here and abroad but the operation was being run out of Nag’s Head, North Carolina. For a variety of reasons that will be discussed, many believe that Oswald was one of these recruits. He left the Marines, defected to the Soviet Union [196] where he immediately announced in public that he was rejecting his American citizenship and turning over everything he had learned while in the Marine Corps at Atsugi Air Force Base (where our ultra-secret U-2 flights originated), and had become a Communist. After living in the Soviet Union for about two years, he announced that he was disillusioned and wanted to return to the United States. Meanwhile, he had married a young Soviet woman, Marina, who was the niece of a Soviet MVD (secret police) officer. Before proceeding further to establish that Oswald was connected with intelligence operations, it would be a good idea to assume first that it is true and then ask the question, “So what?” Would proof that Oswald was an intelligence agent connected with the CIA or ONI prove that the CIA was knowingly involved in a conspiracy to kill John Kennedy? The answer is that it would not. Even if Oswald were an agent, or ex-agent, or double agent, it can be argued that he could have operated alone to assassinate the president. In fact, the whole affair could have been very embarrassing to the CIA and the Navy. Imagine the shock to the CIA or ONI hierarchy to suddenly be confronted with the fact that one of its agents, who was involved in a secret operation in Russia, was now involved in the assassination of the president of the United States! A major damage-control operation, using every technique in its repertoire, would be their first instinctive reaction. We can take this thought further and say that proving that Oswald was a CIA or ONI agent could be part of their defense, in that it could be argued that it would have been very stupid to use one of their agents as a fall guy when it would be so likely to be discovered by future investigators. It follows that the conspiracy was not originated by thoughtful people in the CIA or ONI. More logically it would have originated, if in the CIA or ONI at all, with some of their more fanatical rogue agents, and not by top officials. I would add that Oswald, it seems, was a very impressionable and confused young man, from a broken home without a father, and with many problems. Beyond question, he was fascinated with Marxism and with spy stories. [197] Yet, paradoxically, he joined the Marine Corps, a gung-ho, patriotic act. At the age of seventeen Oswald could have been persuaded to go in many directions—Communist, Communist"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"spy, patriotic soldier, American spy, or what have you—as long as it gave him some sense of belonging and purpose which had been badly lacking in his background. Moreover, it should be kept in mind that Oswald was only twenty years old when he defected from the Marine Corps and went to the Soviet Union. He probably would not have been given a mission of any great importance. More likely, if he were a U.S. spy, he was part of an experiment (perhaps a training mission?) to see what he could learn—in which it was hoped, at least, that he would return with knowledge of the Soviet Union and become a valuable agent when he matured. [198] While Oswald was at Atsugi Air Force Base, he was considered to be somewhat of a loner but was praised by his officer as being competent, intelligent, and a person who could be trusted to catch on quickly and do a job well. Oswald worked in the radar room at Atsugi that monitored the spy flights of the U-2 aircraft over the Soviet Union; he had first-hand access to flight information. The first indication we have of his spy activity was when he began studying the Russian language, presumably on his own, and when he was wandering around the base at Atsugi with a camera, taking pictures. He then started going off on two-day trips to Tokyo where he began having an affair with a beautiful Japanese nightclub hostess who worked at one of the smartest clubs in the city (the Queen Bee), catering to American officers—not enlisted men like Oswald. The girls were expensive, costing more than a month’s salary for one night. Later, while Oswald was stationed at El Toro Base in Santa Ana, California, he revealed what happened at Atsugi: He confided to a fellow Marine, David Bucknell, about the incident. Oswald told Bucknell that after he was first approached at this bar he reported the incident to his superior officer and was debriefed by a man in civilian clothes. He said he was told to go back and give false information to the woman, who was a known KGB agent. We might reasonably speculate from this that it was Oswald’s first introduction to spy work and the beginning of a short career that would end in his death in the basement of a Dallas jail; he could have started his spy career as a double agent in Atsugi. As Oswald continued his stay at Atsugi, he began to develop a reputation for being a troublemaker. He was accused of deliberately pouring a drink over a sergeant but was later acquitted in a court martial. Found guilty of using “provoking words,” he had to spend eighteen days in the brig. Also, according to the record, he accidentally shot himself in the arm, inflicting a minor wound, before his unit was due to leave Atsugi. He did this with a pistol that he kept in his locker, which was against service regulations. For this action he was fined and sentenced to twenty days’ hard labor. According to his friends, Oswald began to speak bitterly against the Marine Corps and avoid Marine acquaintances. He was again seen with Japanese acquaintances, both male and female. Some researchers believe that this whole pattern could have been a set-up to create the false impression that Oswald was a malcontent and beginning to turn Communist. The next incident of Oswald attracting attention to himself as a troublemaker or an eccentric was when his radar unit moved to Taiwan in 1958. While alone on guard duty at night, he fired several shots into the darkness, claiming he had been fired upon by men in the woods. Shortly after that, Oswald declared he could not stand doing sentry duty. He was then transferred back to Atsugi where he took up again with a strikingly beautiful Eurasian woman; Oswald told a friend she was half Russian. Oswald was then transferred to the Marine Corps Air Station in Santa Ana, California. He was again found to be very competent, bright, and dependable. It was in Santa Ana that Oswald exhibited an intensified interest in learning the Russian language. He applied to take a Marine proficiency examination in written and spoken Russian. Although he failed, he did show a knowledge of the basics of the language. In the weeks following, he was observed studying Russian books and a Russian language periodical for hours. Around the barracks, Oswald constantly talked with his Marine friends about Communist ideology and"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"world affairs. He subscribed to The People’s World, a socialist newspaper. He began to openly profess Marxist doctrine, claiming it was the best political system in the world. Next he wrote to the Cuban embassy in Washington and began to receive letters with the Cuban official seal. He confided to his friend, Nelson Delgado from Puerto Rico, that he had visited the Cuban embassy in Los Angeles. Delgado said later that he once saw Oswald in a conversation outside the base with a man wearing an overcoat and concluded the man was a Cuban. He said Oswald and the man talked for about two hours. All of this could have been staged to build a case that Oswald was converting to communism, and led up to the time when he applied for discharge from the Marines, using a fake story that his mother was ill. Shortly thereafter, on the pretense that he was going to Europe to study philosophy at the Albert Schweitzer College in Switzerland, Oswald went to New Orleans and boarded a ship bound for Europe. He disembarked at the British Port of South Hampton on October 9, 1959. By midnight the next day he was checking into a hotel in Helsinki, Finland. [199] Within two days, after no known advance notice, the consulate in Helsinki (a KGB plant) granted Oswald a six-day visa to enter the Soviet Union. This easy access has led researchers to believe that the Soviets were expecting him. This suspicion was reinforced by the claim of Swedish intelligence that they detected a flying visit by Oswald to Stockholm where he may have visited the Soviet embassy. All of this is strangely sophisticated behavior for a twenty-year-old high school dropout who had never traveled anywhere except in the Marines and had very little experience in anything. Oswald was mustered through the Soviet consulate in Helsinki with unusual speed, and on October 16 he arrived in Moscow by train. There he was met by a Russian representative and taken to the Hotel Berlin where he registered as a student. Two weeks later, Oswald walked into the American embassy in Moscow and renounced his American citizenship. He also said that he had voluntarily told Soviet officials that he would make known to them all information concerning the Marine Corps and the specialty radar operation knowledge he possessed. He added that “he might know something of special interest.” Despite the fact that he was a U.S. Marine who had close access to one of America’s top military secrets, the U-2 plane, and knowledge of top-secret radar operations, in addition to his flagrant flaunting his belief in communism, Oswald’s defection to the Soviet Union and outrageous statements did not create a stir in the CIA, ONI, or the FBI. After the assassination, these agencies would deny any interest in Oswald other than routine. Two years later, when Oswald returned to the U.S. with his Russian bride, there was little debriefing of Oswald or Marina and no major investigation of them—at least none admitted by these agencies; the only action taken was that he was given a dishonorable discharge. Agency officials would strangely claim that they had nothing on Oswald in their files: no interviews, no debriefing. This flies in the face of the fact that he was a known defector possessing top military secrets, and his wife was a member of the Communist Party. Years later, in 1978, Senator Richard Schweiker, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee that investigated the performance of the intelligence agencies at the time of the Kennedy assassination, told Anthony Summers, “ Either we trained and sent him to Russia and they went along and pretended they didn’t know to fake us out, or in fact, they inculcated him and sent him back here and were trying to fake us out that way.” During Oswald’s time in Russia he was sent to the city of Minsk where he was put up in a roomy apartment with a balcony overlooking a river that was considered luxurious by Soviet standards. He was given a job in a Russian radio and television factory and put on a monthly allowance. He proceeded to have the time of his life and wrote in his diary that he was “living big.” But there may have been another reason for him being in Minsk and that was to be trained as a KGB agent in a spy training school known to the CIA. The school had been in operation as far back as 1947. This was brought up by FBI director J. Edgar Hoover when he wondered aloud to the Warren Commission on the subject. [200]"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"It was in Minsk that Oswald met Marina, whom he would marry within six weeks after a whirlwind courtship. Marina later remarked that when she met Oswald he spoke flawless Russian and she actually thought he was a native citizen. In the previous chapter we described the way in which, in the last sixty days before the assassination, Oswald was being set up as a fall guy, at times by the use of an Oswald impersonator and at other times by the use of the real Oswald—in one case to establish Oswald as a left-wing, pro-Castro activist; in another case as a lone nut speaking sympathetically of going back to Russia; or in another case as a wild rifleman practicing on the rifle range and annoying people; and, in yet another case, possibly as part of a conspiracy of leftist anti-Castro activists. But the use of Oswald impersonators goes back far beyond that. One case that is indeed strange goes back to January 20, 1961, the time of Kennedy’s inauguration, when Oswald was in Russia. This event occurred in New Orleans at the Bolton Ford dealership on North Clayborne Avenue when two men came into the dealership on that day and said they wanted to buy ten Ford pickup trucks. One man was a Latin who identified himself as “Joseph Moore.” The other was a young Anglo who confirmed that they wanted to buy the trucks and said his name was “Oswald.” When the first man said that the bid should be in the name of Oswald, the truck salesman, Oscar Deslatte, printed the name Oswald on the sales form. The two men dealing for the trucks said they should get a good bid because they were buying them for a patriotic cause in that they were members of the Friends of Democratic Cuba. This incident was confirmed by another auto salesman at the agency, Fred Sewall."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Lee Harvey Oswald in custody of the Dallas police. When Oswald was arrested in Dallas he proclaimed his innocence and wanted to call a prominent conspiracy attorney in New York, but he was murdered before he had a chance to do so. He also tried to call a number that may have been his contact in military intelligence, but the call was cut off. Remarkably, Oswald spoke Russian with little accent, although he reportedly had no formal training in Russian and was a high school dropout. His wife Marina said that when she first met him in Russia she thought he was a native Russian. Oswald knew David Ferrie, who was first accused of being a part of the assassination by district attorney Jim Garrison in New Orleans, and who later committed suicide when the matter became public. Ferrie was a rabid anti-Communist and right-wing extremist. Ferrie was an employee of Carlos Marcello, Mafia chieftain in New Orleans, who was under extreme attack by Robert Kennedy.

Source: National Archives"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Following President Kennedy’s assassination, the two car salesmen remembered Oswald’s visit and called the FBI, who arrived and picked up the bid form with tongs. The foregoing incident was discovered by Jim Garrison’s investigating team in New Orleans, which obtained a copy of the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba and discovered that it was in the name of Guy Banister. As you may recall, it was Guy Banister who was up to his eyeballs in the conspiracy along with David Ferrie and Carlos Marcello. Also recall that when Oswald was arrested for the altercation while he was handing out literature for Fair Play for Cuba, it was discovered that the 544 Camp Street address was on the literature. This was also the address of Guy Banister. Jim Garrison writes: I pondered the implications of this staggering information. In the very month that John Kennedy was inaugurated, an intelligence project being run by Guy Banister was using the name “Oswald” in bidding for pickup trucks for apparent use in the Bay of Pigs Invasion. More important, the young American who had done the bidding either knew Lee Oswald or knew his name. In either case, Oswald was far off in the Soviet Union at the time.... This fascinating evidence shows that someone connected with anti-Castro operations was falsely using Oswald’s name and implies that Oswald must have been designated long before the Kennedy assassination as a person whose name and identity could be used for disinformation purposes by U.S. intelligence agencies. Although it is difficult to imagine what the CIA (or some other entity) had in mind in creating Oswald-type characters in 1961, the evidence indicates that this was in fact going on. This was picked up by J. Edgar Hoover, who issued a memorandum that someone was using Lee Harvey Oswald’s name and birth certificate for false identification purposes.2 Was this part of a long-range CIA program, with the right hand not knowing what the left hand was doing, to create several people who could be used as false sponsors for yet-unknown future programs? The deeper one gets into studying Oswald the more mysterious it becomes. Future investigators would go after Oswald like hounds chasing the scent, only to end up frustrated and tearing their hair out because each trail meandered into the forest and petered out. Exhibit 18-1 shows some of the most important activities of Oswald for the first nine months of 1963. What I am looking for here is a systematic pattern of evidence showing that the CIA or some other entity was setting up Oswald as a fall guy for the assassination of the president. An indication of this occurs in early March when Oswald, using the alias A. J. Hidell, purchased (through the mail) the rifle that allegedly was used to kill JFK. When Oswald received the rifle he allegedly posed for backyard photographs taken in Irving, Texas, holding the rifle along with Communist literature. As Jim Garrison said, this may be the first time in the annals of assassinations where the assassin has been so stupid as to purchase his weapon by mail order, use an alias, have the name of the alias in his wallet when he is captured, and have pictures taken of himself holding the rifle along with inflammatory literature—which was easily found. But the strange thing about this charade is that it has the distinct appearance of being a set-up of Oswald in which he apparently willingly participated. Exhibit 18-1.

As strange as this may seem, there is a consistent pattern of his participation in self-incrimination. The most blatant example was when he allegedly attempted to kill Major General Edwin Walker in Dallas on April 10, 1963. On that night, someone fired a rifle through a window in General Walker’s home, hitting the window frame and missing his head by inches as he sat at the desk in his study. During the Warren Commission investigation it was concluded that Oswald was the lone shooter. This was based primarily on the testimony of his wife Marina who said that Oswald came home late that night, nervous and excited, and confessed to her that he had attempted to kill General Walker. But from the beginning there was an abundance of evidence suggesting that there was more than one person involved in the shooting. General Walker was the darling of the right-wing extremists in Dallas. He had been relieved of his command by President Kennedy for using his position to distribute right-wing propaganda to his men. Walker had then resigned from the Army in anger and had thrown himself into a variety of rabid right- wing political activities, including inciting a race riot in which two people were killed. He then had been temporarily consigned to a mental institution by Attorney General Robert Kennedy. General Walker was a leading member of the John Birch Society. [201] At the time of the shooting incident at General Walker’s, a fourteen-year-old boy, Walter Coleman, was standing in the doorway of a nearby house and heard the shot. When he looked over the fence to see what was going on, he saw at least two men. He testified to the House Assassination Committee that he saw some men speeding down the alley in a light green or light blue Ford, either a 1959 or a 1960 model. He said he also saw another car, a 1958 Chevrolet, black with white down the side, in the church parking lot adjacent to the Walker’s house. He said the car door was open and that a man was bending over the back seat as though he was placing something on the floor of the car. The young Coleman said that he had gotten a good look at these men and neither one resembled Oswald. (Recall that Oswald did not own a car and did not know how to drive.) This evidence was reinforced by one of General Walker’s aides, Robert Surrey, who had spotted two men prowling around the house peeking in the windows about four days before the shooting incident. Another of the general’s aides said that while on watch for prowlers a few days before the incident he noticed a “Cuban or dark- complexioned man in a 1957 Chevrolet” drive slowly around the general’s house on several occasions. [202] After the assassination investigators found among Oswald’s possessions a photograph showing a rear view of General Walker’s house and parked outside was a 1957 Chevrolet. When the photograph was produced by the Warren Commission a hole had been cut in the picture where the car’s numbered plate should be. Marina Oswald said that when she had seen the photograph she was positive there was no hole in it. On April 24 Oswald moved to New Orleans; his wife and children followed him in the latter part of May. Upon arriving in New Orleans, Oswald obtained a job at the Reilly Coffee Company, [203] located just down the street from Guy Banister’s office. In mid-June Oswald was taken by his uncle, a Marcello lieutenant with whom he was living at the time, to a Jesuit seminary where he made a speech describing the failures of communism. Here we have another example of Oswald putting forth a right-wing image in contradiction to his other actions with a left-wing image. At almost the same time, on June 16, Oswald for the first time handed out Fair Play for Cuba materials outside of the Naval shipyard in New Orleans. As discussed earlier, some of the more important evidence connecting Oswald with David Ferrie occurred during August 1963 in Clinton, Louisiana, some 130 miles from New Orleans. Oswald came to town with two men—one was David Ferrie and the other, an older man who, according to Jim Garrison, was Clay Shaw. According to Jim Garrison, all of Oswald’s activities in New Orleans that summer were part of the"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"CIA’s “sheep-dipping” of Oswald to create his bona fides as an unstable character going from one job to another. (Oswald had just been dismissed from his job at Reilly Coffee Company—now he had applied for a job in a mental hospital.) There appears to be little doubt that Oswald was being prepared for some future role by his handlers, who were CIA and FBI connected as well as Mafia connected. Over the years this has been looked upon by most researchers as a sinister operation connecting Shaw, Banister, and Ferrie and the CIA to the conspiracy. But the possibility should not be dismissed that the sheep-dipping of Oswald may, in part, have been for some other mission that was unrelated to assassinating JFK, such as preparing Oswald to be a double agent who would later defect to Cuba, or even return to Russia on a second mission. The Oswald sheep-dipping operation in New Orleans continued through September until Oswald left for his trip to Mexico City on September 25. It was during this period in New Orleans that, according to Jim Garrison, Oswald was seen receiving money from Clay Shaw at Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana, by a heroin addict by the name of Vernon Bundy. Garrison also brought forth a witness by the name of Perry Russo who claimed he had been at a party of homosexuals in New Orleans in which he participated in a conversation with Clay Shaw, David Ferrie, and Oswald in which Ferrie talked of assassinating JFK with triangular crossfire. * * * In summary, we can conclude with reasonable confidence that Oswald was a CIA agent who was sent to the Soviet Union on a special mission. And there is little room for doubt that he was set up by some entity as a fall guy in the JFK assassination plot. Whether or not Oswald was knowingly part of the plot remains uncertain. He could have been involved in another covert operation unrelated to the Kennedy assassination, but have been co-opted by the real conspirators. The evidence that Oswald was linked with Guy Banister and anti-Castro Cuban operations, and Clay Shaw and David Ferrie, is virtually unassailable. We will now address what is considered by many to be one of the most important aspects of understanding the mystery of the JFK assassination: Oswald’s Trip to Mexico City."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"“Maurice Bishop” was David Atlee Phillips.

Gaeton Fonzi, Former Investigator for the HSCA 19 OSWALD’S TRIP TO MEXICO CITY Over the years since the assassination of President Kennedy, there has been an almost continuous evolution of evidence and information concerning the events of Oswald’s trip to Mexico City. Recently (as late as December 20, 1995), relevant documents have been released as a result of the Assassination Records Review Board established by Congress. This includes reports heretofore held secret: such as cable traffic between Mexico City and the CIA at Langley, Virginia; wiretaps of the Soviet and Cuban embassies; and detailed reports prepared by the HSCA but then suppressed. Although there still remain redacted portions of the information, and key documents that have not been released, it is now possible to piece together enough evidence to provide a valid base for the purposes of this book. Overview of Events in Mexico City Please refer to Exhibit 19-1. In the discussions that follow, I will assume that it was the real Oswald who traveled to Mexico City, although some respected researchers believe that it was an Oswald impersonator. That may be true, but I haven’t found a strong-enough argument to reach that conclusion. Therefore, I will confine my analysis to the assumption that it was the real Oswald who traveled to Mexico City, and examine whether it was an Oswald impersonator who visited both the Cuban and Soviet consulates while the real Oswald was elsewhere in Mexico City.

(Fonzi, p. 143) January 22 : CIA leaked to Warren Commission that Oswald had contacted KGB office On October 10, 1963, more than one month before the assassination, the Mexico City CIA station sent teletypes to the FBI, the State Department, and the Department of the Navy with the following message: Subject: Lee Henry [ sic ] Oswald. 1) On 1 October 1963 a reliable and sensitive source in Mexico reported that an American male, who identified himself as Lee Oswald, contacted the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City inquiring whether the Embassy had received any news concerning a telegram which had been sent to Washington. The American was described as approximately 35 years old, with an athletic build, about six feet tall, with a receding hairline.... 2) It is believed that Oswald may be identical to Lee Henry [sic] Oswald, born on 18 October 1939 in New Orleans, Louisiana. A former U.S. Marine who defected to the Soviet Union in October 1959 and later made arrangements through the United States Embassy in Moscow to return to the United States with his Russian-born wife, Marian Nikolaevna Pusakova [sic], and their child.... HSCA Vol. IV, p. 219 This did not fit the Navy description of Oswald, which said he was slender, five feet nine inches tall, and only twenty-four years old. It seems that if the CIA as an organization were in fact involved in a conspiracy to set up Oswald in the assassination, it would not have deliberately released a teletype with a description of a man it said was Oswald when the description was unquestionably erroneous. The next clue is that on the day of the assassination the CIA in Mexico City sent a packet of information by special plane to the FBI in Dallas. The packet contained a photograph taken outside the Soviet embassy in Mexico City on October 1, and it identified the man in the photograph as Oswald. Again, the photograph was of someone who clearly was not Oswald: It showed a much older, much heavier man who had no resemblance to Oswald. The photograph seemed to be consistent with the description of the man referred to in the teletype sent on October 10. When the CIA was later questioned about the contradiction between the written and photographic descriptions of Oswald and the real Oswald, it said that there had been a mix-up in the photos. If the CIA had stopped there, it might have been better off. As time proceeded, it became determined to prove that Oswald had in fact visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies. Yet the CIA was unable to produce any photographs of him entering or leaving either of the embassies, despite ten photo opportunities with automatically operated surveillance cameras located in buildings across the street. The proof provided by the Warren Commission of visits by Oswald to the Cuban or Soviet embassies was in a statement of a Cuban consulate employee, Silvia Duran, that the CIA had obtained from “Mexican authorities”: ...she remembered...[that Lee Harvey Oswald] was the name of an American who had come to the Cuban Consulate to obtain a visa to travel to Cuba in transit to Russia, the latter part of September or the early part of October of this year, and in support of his application had shown his passport, in which it was noted that he had lived in that country for a period of three years; his labor card from the same country written in the Russian language; and letters in that same language. He had presented evidence that he was married to a Russian woman, and also that he was apparently the leader of an organization in the city of New Orleans called “Fair Play for Cuba,” claiming that he"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"should be accepted as a “friend” of the Cuban Revolution.... Accordingly, the declarant, complying with her duties, took down all of the information and completed the appropriate application form; and the declarant, admittedly exceeding her responsibilities, informally telephoned the Russian consulate, with the intention of doing what she could to facilitate issuance of the Russian visa to Lee Harvey Oswald. However, they told her that there would be a delay of about four months in processing the case, which annoyed the applicant since, according to his statement, he was in a great hurry to obtain visas that would enable him to travel to Russia, insisting on his right to do so in view of his background and his loyalty and his activities in behalf of the Cuban movement. WCR, pp. 301- 302 The Warren Commission Report went on to say that when Oswald was informed of the delay he became very angry and excited and created such a scene that he was ordered out of the consulate by the Cuban consul himself, Eusebio Azcue. Then, on January 22, 1964, the CIA leaked to commission members that Oswald had made contact with a KGB officer, Valery Kostikov, while in the Soviet embassy. The agency said Kostikov’s responsibilities included “assassination and sabotage.” The commission also received a report that Oswald had been seen receiving $6,500 inside the Cuban consulate on September 18, 1963, during which discussions of killing Kennedy took place. [204] The FBI soon discredited this report as a fabrication. These possible links between Oswald and a KGB or Cuban assassination plot so disturbed Warren Commission members that they were content to take the word of the FBI and CIA for Oswald’s Mexico activities. After all, if these statements were true and became known to the American public, the government’s options to prevent escalation to nuclear war would be greatly reduced. Immediately after the assassination, cable traffic began to flow between CIA headquarters at Langley and the CIA Mexico City station in which it was finally ordered by Langley, after a dispute with CIA Mexico personnel, that Silvia Duran be arrested and interrogated by the Mexican authorities. Duran, a twenty-six-year-old Mexican national, had been employed at the Cuban consulate only one month before Oswald arrived in Mexico City. A CIA cable regarding Duran’s arrest, dated November 27, 1963 and declassified only in recent months, stated: CURTIS FROM KNIGHT [205] RE: MEXI-7101 1. THIS INSTRUCTION HAS BEEN COORDINATED [SIC] WITH ODACID AND ODENVY. 2. MEXICAN AUTHORITIES SHOULD INTERROGATE SILVIA DURAN TO EXTENT NECESSARY CLARIFY OUTSTANDING POINTS WHICH BEEN RAISED YOUR CABLED LAST 48 HOURS. YOU MAY PROVIDE QUESTIONS TO MEXICAN INTERROGATORS BUT WE DO NOT REPEAT NOT WANT ANY AMERICANS TO CONFRONT SILVIA DURAN OR BE IN CONTACT WITH HER . 3. ADVISE ASAP RESULTS INTERROGATION. CIA Document 158-610 (Emphasis added) This cable is of special interest because it reveals that the CIA wanted the Duran incident strictly kept from Americans; presumably only the Mexican authorities could be trusted. What we see here is clear evidence of a cover-up, ordered by top levels of the CIA, of Oswald’s activities in Mexico City. It also indicates a very close relationship between the CIA and the Mexican authorities. “Mexican authorities” as used here refers to Mexican intelligence: the DFS—Dirección Federal de Seguridad. In December 1995 I learned important new information from Cuban intelligence at a conference in"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Nassau; that the electronic surveillance of the Cuban and Soviet embassies in Mexico City had been subcontracted, at least in part, by the CIA to the DFS. I also learned from Peter Dale Scott (who attended the conference) that his newly published [206] research indicates that the DFS had been engaged in criminal activities with none other than Chicago Mafiosi Sam Giancana and Richard Cain, Giancana’s electronics specialist. In his book Deep Politics II , Scott wrote: ...One man who may have been involved is Richard S. Cain (alias Scalzetti), the notorious Chicago mob figure and right-hand man to Sam Giancana who was also an FBI informant, and at the very least, a CIA contact. The CIA’s own files show that Cain visited the CIA’s Mexico City Station in April 1962, at which time “he stated that he had an investigative agency in Mexico...for the purpose of training Mexican government agents in police methods, in investigative techniques, and in the use of the lie detector.” Cain’s expertise was in electronic surveillance, most notoriously the tapping of telephones. In the period 1950-52 he had tapped the telephones of Cuban revolutionary leaders in Miami on behalf of Batista; in 1960 he was approached by his former employer to install phone taps on behalf of former Cuban President Prio. According to an obituary notice in the Chicago Tribune, the CIA had engaged Cain in 1960 because of his Havana mob contacts, and also to wiretap the Czech embassy in Havana. Thus Cain would appear to be a likely candidate to supply the “technical assistance” which Agee says the Mexico City CIA station provided the DFS on the LIENVOY operation.... [207] The Cubans at the Nassau conference confirmed to me (not surprisingly) that the DFS was indeed corrupt in 1963. And we see from the cable traffic that the CIA ordered DFS officials to participate in a conspiracy to cover up evidence in Mexico City relating to the Kennedy assassination. There seems to be no end to the ring of corruption and deceit into which the CIA had become embroiled. I wondered if some of the Cubans and Soviets in Mexico City in 1963 were not also involved in the corruption. When Oswald visited the Cuban consulate he made such scenes, in a series of three visits on September 27, that he was finally ordered out of the building. His anger was provoked when he was told that he could not get a Cuban visa in the three days he was seeking. He shouted and called the embassy personnel “bureaucrats.” The impression he made was indelible. Present at the final scene were Silvia Duran and her supervisor, Cuban consul Eusebio Azcue. Fifteen years later, Azcue told the HSCA that he was convinced that the man who visited the embassy in 1963 was not the Oswald arrested in Dallas. After viewing photos of Oswald, Azcue stated: “My belief is that this gentleman was not, is not, the person or the individual who went to the consulate.” He based his belief on his memory of the man calling himself Oswald as five foot six inches tall, with dark blond hair and distinctly different facial features. Azcue’s testimony was reinforced by his memory of when he first saw a movie of Ruby killing Oswald. He said: “I saw at that time the film...and I was not able to identify him and only two months had gone by since I had seen the Oswald who appeared at the consulate, and I had a clear mental picture because we had an unpleasant discussion....” [208] Also presumably not revealed to the Warren Commission was the fact that Silvia Duran, while being interrogated by the DFS, had described Oswald as short with blond hair. This was confirmed in a National Archives document dated November 29, 1963, released in December 1995: SHE [DURAN] REMEMBERED HIS NAME BECAUSE OF HIS UNUSUAL CHARACTERISTICS AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS VISIT, I.E., HE WAS MARRIED TO A RUSSIAN AND SAID HE BELONGED TO THE “FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA”; THAT SHE CHECKED HIS DATA IN THE CONSU-LATE’S ARCHIVES AND SHE WAS THEN SURE"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"THAT IT WAS THE SAME PERSON. THAT HE IS BLOND, SHORT, POORLY DRESSED, THAT HIS FACE GETS RED WHEN HE TALKS; THAT HE WAS DENIED A VISA BECAUSE THE CONSUL TOLD HIM THAT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN ONE HE WOULD FIRST NEED A VISA FROM THE RUSSIAN CONSULATE AND THIS PROCEDURE WOULD TAKE ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AND URGED OSWALD TO LEAVE MEXICO. OSWALD BECAME ANGRY AND FOR THIS REASON SHE HAD TO CALL THE CONSUL WITH WHOM HE HAD AN ARGUMENT. CIA translation of report by DFS, document no. 85758, p. 6 (Emphasis added) Silvia Duran’s description of Oswald was repeated in more detail when she testified before the HSCA in 1978. She described Oswald as about her height (she is five feet three inches); about her weight (119 pounds); having very light blond hair that was thinning, (“not much hair”), and blue eyes. [209] However, according to his passport in the Warren Commission Report, the real Oswald was five feet eleven inches tall, had thinning brown hair and gray eyes. [210] He weighed about 131 to 165 pounds (reports vary; curiously, his height was shown as five feet nine inches in a Navy photograph). Note that this translation says that she was “sure that it was the same person” but only after checking data in the consulate’s archives. She also said that Oswald was blond and short. When Duran checked the data in the files, all she would have been able to see was a visa application photo which does not show Oswald as blond but with very dark hair. A description of Oswald similar to that of Duran and Azcue was independently given by a Mexican student at Mexico National University who met Oswald during his short visit to the city. This meeting with Oswald was revealed by Oscar Contraras, who was studying to be a lawyer at the university. Contraras belonged to a left-wing Cuban group that supported the Castro revolution and had contacts in the Cuban embassy. [211] The HSCA was the first to interview Contraras. He was reluctant to reveal much about the incident, but Anthony Summers was able to find Contraras later in Mexico City and interview him. [212] Contraras told Summers that one evening in late September 1963 he and three other students were sitting in a university cafeteria when a man at a nearby table introduced himself. When he did so, he spelled out his entire name, “Lee Harvey Oswald.” This made a distinct impression on Contraras and his friends because they connected “Harvey” and “Oswald” to a popular movie about a rabbit. Contraras said that the man who claimed to be Oswald was only about five feet six inches tall. He remembered this because he is five feet nine inches tall and looked down on Oswald in conversations. Oswald told the students that he was having trouble getting a visa at the Cuban embassy and wanted to know if there was anything they could do to help him. (Strangely, a coincidence perhaps, Oswald had connected with students who had contacts at the Cuban embassy.) They agreed to help him and that night contacted the embassy, including consul Azcue and a Cuban intelligence officer. They were told to break off contact with Oswald at once, that the embassy officials suspected him of trying to infiltrate left-wing groups. When the students next saw Oswald, they told him that the Cubans did not trust him and would not give him a visa. Oswald kept up his attempts to be friendly to the Mexican students and ended up spending the night at their apartment. At the time of the Summers’ interview, Contraras was the editor of a Mexican newspaper, El Mundo. Contraras questioned how Oswald could have known that these particular students, out of all the students at the university, might indeed be able to help him. Contraras said he believed this was not divine inspiration, and that something else the Cuban official said when warning him to drop Oswald helped arouse his suspicion. The Cuban intelligence officer thought “Oswald was highly suspect as being some sort of provocateur sent by the United States to go to Cuba with evil intent.” Further evidence of an Oswald impostor comes from an episode involving a voice tape recording. In"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"1976, at the onset of the HSCA investigation, CIA officer David Atlee Phillips, one of the Bay of Pigs organizers (who at the time of Oswald’s alleged visit was chief of Cuban operations in Mexico City), told the committee’s general counsel that the CIA had made tape recordings of conversations between Oswald and the Soviet embassy. When pressed as to why the tapes, clear proof of Oswald’s Mexican visit, had not been given to the Warren Commission, Phillips said that they had been routinely destroyed about a week after they were taken with the reasoning that Oswald had not been considered important prior to the assassination. [213] However, after Phillips’ 1976 testimony, a five-page FBI document dated November 23, 1963 that refuted Phillips’ story became public in 1979 in the HSCA report. According to this report, FBI agents who were questioning Oswald in Dallas were informed by CIA officers that Oswald had contacted the Soviet embassy in Mexico City. The FBI report went on to state: The Central Intelligence Agency advised that on October 1, 1963, an extremely sensitive source had reported that an individual identifying himself as Lee Oswald contacted the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City inquiring as to any messages. Special agents of this Bureau, who have conversed with Oswald in Dallas, Texas, have observed photographs of the individual referred to above and have listened to a recording of his voice. These Special Agents are of the opinion that the above-referred-to individual was not Lee Harvey Oswald. [214] (Emphasis added) In other words, the CIA wiretap of Oswald was not destroyed in October but was available to FBI agents on November 23. This is evidence that Phillips was lying in his testimony to the HSCA. Once again, testimonies had placed the FBI and the CIA in embarrassing positions. But they were up to the challenge. Later in the HSCA investigation, the FBI denied that a tape recording of Oswald’s voice had been received. As evidence, the FBI offered cable traffic in which FBI agents Shanklin and Hosty said that there was some confusion and the tape recordings had never been received. They said that only transcripts of tape recordings had been received. J. Gordon Shanklin and James Hosty were the two FBI agents involved in destroying a note that Oswald left with the FBI in Dallas shortly before the assassination, which leaves one inclined to question the FBI agents’ second version and believe the original report—it was very explicit, leaving no doubt that the FBI had listened to a recording of a voice, and the voice was not Oswald’s. Final corroboration that Phillips lied in his testimony to the HSCA was provided sixteen years later. In a telephone conversation between J. Edgar Hoover and Lyndon Johnson, recorded a few days after the assassination (declassified from the National Archives on October 26, 1993), Hoover told Johnson that the FBI had listened to this recording on November 23, 1963 and the voice was not that of Oswald : LBJ: Have you established any more about the visit to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico in September? Hoover: No, that’s one angle that’s very confusing for this reason. We have up here the tape and the photograph of the man who was at the Soviet Embassy, using Oswald’s name. That picture and the tape do not correspond to this man’s voice , nor to his appearance. In other words, it appears that there is a second person who was at the Soviet Embassy down there. (Emphasis added) What we have here is evidence—from the mouth of Hoover himself—that FBI agents Shanklin and Hosty were either lying or somehow confused when they said they had only the transcripts (not the tapes). Moreover, Hoover would have known that they were not telling the truth. It seems evident that they were all working in concert with the CIA to protect David Atlee Phillips and the CIA, thus suppressing evidence of a conspiracy. It also confirms that, indeed, Phillips was lying. David Atlee Phillips has long been suspected of being the mysterious Maurice Bishop, a code name"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"for a CIA undercover agent who was seen with Oswald in Dallas and who attempted to recruit Antonio Veciana to offer a large sum of money to Veciana’s relative, Guillermo Ruiz, a “Cuban official” in Mexico City who reportedly witnessed Oswald in the Cuban consulate, to say that he and his wife had been contacted by Oswald in Mexico City. Veciana said that he had agreed to contact his relative, but had been unable to do so. This testimony was given by Veciana to the HSCA. [215] Veciana, a Cuban exile leader, had been a respected accountant in Cuba and one of the founders of Alpha 66, a radical right-wing Cuban exile organization intent on doing away with Castro. Veciana was recruited into the CIA to support anti-Castro operations. He is considered by Gaeton Fonzi, the HSCA staff member who dealt with him, to be a very reliable witness. In his testimony, Veciana said that Maurice Bishop was his control agent who had been working with him over a period of thirteen years, during which he had met with him over one hundred times. He said that Bishop had guided him in planning attempts to assassinate Castro. At his meeting with Fonzi, and later in his testimony to the HSCA, Veciana described a meeting between himself and Maurice Bishop in Dallas in late August or the first days of September 1963. He said that he had met with Bishop often in Dallas during their long association. During this particular trip he met with him at a skyscraper building in downtown Dallas which has been tentatively identified as the Southland Center. They met in a public area on the first floor; Veciana arrived a little ahead of schedule. Bishop was not alone. Veciana said that there was a young man standing with Bishop who gave him the impression of being very quiet, very strange, and preoccupied. He said that the three of them walked to a cafeteria. The young man was with them ten or fifteen minutes, until Bishop told him something like, “all right, see you later,” and dismissed him. Veciana said that after the assassination he identified Oswald when his face suddenly appeared in newspapers and on television. Then, Veciana said, he at once recognized Oswald as the young man he had seen in Dallas at the meeting with Bishop. [216] In the staff report, the HSCA noted that there was absolutely no doubt in Veciana’s mind that the man was Oswald, not just someone who resembled him. Veciana said it was either Oswald or an exact double. Artist’s sketch of Maurice Bishop on the left. David Atlee Phillips on the right.

He also testified that he and Maurice Bishop had been headed for a meeting in Dallas when they encountered Oswald, and Bishop spoke with him. This occurred in late August or early September 1963. After Veciana’s testimony, he was ambushed and shot in the head, but he recovered. Evidence from multiple sources shows that Maurice Bishop and Phillips were the same person. Phillips was CIA chief of covert operations in the Cuban section of the Mexico City station at the time of the assassination, and was CIA’s man monitoring the activities of anti-Castro organizations DRE and Photo Source: Assassination Archives Alpha 66."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"When we combine the above with Veciana’s testimony to the HSCA that Bishop attempted to get him to bribe a Cuban official and with proof (presently to be discussed) that Bishop was in fact CIA officer David Atlee Phillips, we have a direct linkage of the CIA to Oswald and possibly to the assassination of John Kennedy. In his testimony, Veciana would not identify David Atlee Phillips as being Maurice Bishop. He was perhaps anticipating the danger in which he was placing himself. His fear was justified inasmuch as he was the victim of a murder attempt in late 1979. Four shots were fired in an ambush and a fragment of one bullet struck Veciana’s head. He miraculously recovered, but privately expressed concern that the attempt was linked to his testimonies concerning Maurice Bishop. Curiously, he blamed Fidel Castro. Despite considerable effort by the HSCA (involving a composite artist’s picture based on Veciana’s descriptions), they were unable to bring themselves to identify Maurice Bishop as being in reality David Atlee Phillips. But Gaeton Fonzi, the HSCA staff member who investigated David Atlee Phillips and Maurice Bishop, was not so reluctant. In his 1993 book The Last Investigation he wrote: “‘Maurice Bishop’ was David Atlee Phillips. I state that unequivocally, although Veciana cannot officially identify him publicly as such. In addition to the abundance of evidence...which unerringly points to Phillips being Bishop, believe me, I know that he was. And Bob Blakey and the House Assassinations Committee knew that he was, although its report did not admit that.” [217] Anthony Summers wrote that, “Before he died, Phillips had several conversations with Kevin Walsh, a former Assassinations Committee staffer now working as a private detective in Washington D.C. He never opened up on specifics, but he did say something about the assassination of President Kennedy. ‘ My private opinion,’ said Phillips, ‘is that JFK was done in by a conspiracy, likely including rogue American intelligence people.’ Phillips said this in July 1986, and Walsh made a precise note. The remark was astounding, not in itself but coming as it did from the former chief of the CIA’s Western Hemisphere Division.” [218] (I confirmed this in a telephone conversation with Kevin Walsh in August 1996. Walsh told me that Summers had quoted him correctly.) It should be noted that Phillips’ remark does not preclude that he himself was part of this rogue operation, or that his statement to Walsh was designed to confuse future investigators about Phillips’ true role. One of Phillips’ specialties in the CIA was psychological disinformation schemes to set people on false trails. He was a professional liar. His talent for this came naturally. He had tried to become a professional actor as a young man, then got into the advertising business before joining the CIA. The fact that Maurice Bishop was a CIA employee was confirmed by John McCone, director of the CIA at the time of the Kennedy assassination. This deposition took place in the HSCA investigation during which the following conversation took place: [219] [220] Q Do you, or did you know Maurice Bishop? A Yes. Q Was he an agency employee? A I believe so. In its further investigations, the committee interviewed a former CIA agent, code name B. H., who when asked if he knew Bishop replied, “Mr. Bishop was in the organization, but I had no personal day-to- day open relationship with him....” He said vaguely that Bishop had been a senior officer, that he had met with him “two or three times” at CIA headquarters. Another former CIA case officer proved to be even more informative. The committee, quoting him under the pseudonym “Ron Cross,” reported that he had handled one of the most active anti-Castro groups and was well placed to have known Maurice Bishop,"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"and that he was certain that David Atlee Phillips had used the name Bishop. [221] I learned later from Gaeton Fonzi that Ron Cross knew Maurice Bishop as David Atlee Phillips while at CIA station JM/WAVE in Florida, along with his accomplice, David Sanchez Morales, assassination specialist for the CIA. At the Nassau conference, Castro’s General Fabian Escalante confirmed that there were two independent sources in Cuba who testified to Cuban officials that David Atlee Phillips used the name Maurice Bishop. In addition, Wayne Smith, who was formerly stationed at the American embassy in Cuba as a State Department representative, confirmed to me at the Nassau meeting that David Atlee Phillips was a close associate of David Sanchez Morales. The importance of David Sanchez Morales was noted previously; he is suspected of being a ringleader in the JFK assassination. This subject, with more on Phillips, will be addressed in a later chapter concerning the execution phase of the assassination. Analysis of Recently Released Phone Taps, Cable Traffic, and Related Events in Mexico City Referring to Exhibit 19-2, we see that after arriving in Mexico City by bus at about 10:00 a.m. on Friday, September 27, Oswald checked into the Hotel del Commercio at 10:30 a.m. At about that time, a man called the Soviet consulate to inquire about getting a visa to travel to Odessa in the Soviet Union. Then at about 12:00 p.m. a man calling himself Oswald arrived at the Soviet embassy. Oswald’s appearance at the Soviet consulate was reported by Colonel Oleg M. Nechiporenko in his book Passport to Assassination, and was confirmed by Valery Kostikov, who was also one of the consulate employees (in fact, a KGB assassination specialist) who was receiving visitors that day. According to Nechiporenko, both he and Kostikov believe that the man in the Soviet embassy was the real Oswald. (However, in a telephone conversation with researcher Bob Dorff in June 1996 Nechiporenko said that he could not rule out that the man could have been an Oswald look-alike.) They immediately recognized him on November 22 when his picture appeared on television. Nechiporenko describes Oswald as he appeared in the September 27 visit to the Soviet consulate: He appeared to be a European or American. He was of medium height, with a longish face, a narrow chin, and a high forehead that clearly tended toward baldness. I would call him a brunette. [222] Nechiporenko wrote that the man spoke very poor Russian: His pronunciation was bad, he really mangled the grammar.... [223] The fact that the man spoke very poor, mangled Russian is, of course, in conflict with the fact that Oswald spoke fluent Russian. Exhibit 19-2.

She says, “He is here now” [227] Saturday, September 28 9 :30 to 10:00 a.m .: Oswald at Russian embassy [228] 11:51 a.m .: Silvia Duran calls Soviet embassy; says Oswald, who had previously been to Cuban embassy want to talk.

She said the American was requesting a Cuban visa in transit to the USSR. She was asked to leave her telephone number. Then, at 4:26 p.m., the Soviet embassy called the Cuban embassy and asked Silvia Duran if the American had been at the Cuban embassy. She responded, “He is here now.” They then discussed the visa application. At that point it was revealed that the American’s Russian wife also wanted to go to the USSR via Cuba. The Soviet replied that he had not yet had a reply from Washington, D.C., where he had sent a telegram to get further information. The next clue we have is that at about 9:30 or 10:00 a.m. the next day (Saturday, September 28), a man calling himself Oswald appeared at the Russian embassy. This was reported by Nechiporenko and also by Pavel Yatskov, who was the first to show up at the Russian embassy that Saturday morning. The Russians were getting together for a volleyball game that they usually played beginning around 10 o’clock on Saturday mornings. Yatskov described the person calling himself Oswald as “a thin subject, of medium height and nondescript appearance, age twenty-five to twenty-seven.... He was carelessly dressed, in a gray suit. His"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"pale features and the extremely agitated look of his face were especially noticeable. I told him to take a seat at the attached desk, and I sat down at my own....” Nechiporenko described Oswald as the same man who was at the Soviet consulate on September 27. The man calling himself Oswald again spoke broken Russian. Kostikov also described him as the same person. [237] Nechiporenko wrote that while Oswald was with him and Kostikov, Oswald said he feared for his life at the hands of the FBI, and then took out a revolver saying he must carry it to protect himself. He wrote that Oswald became “hysterical, began to sob, ‘I’m afraid they are going to kill me. Let me in!’” [238] Then, at 11:51 a.m., a woman who called herself Silvia Duran phoned the Soviet embassy to say that Oswald, who had previously been in the Cuban embassy, wanted to talk. A man got on the phone, again speaking broken Russian. The HSCA, in its analysis, made a note of the caller speaking broken Russian, indicating that this person probably was not Oswald. Another contradiction is that the Cuban consulate was normally closed on Saturday, so if Duran were in fact with Oswald it would have been somewhere outside the consulate. Moreover, when Silvia Duran testified before the HSCA she emphatically stated that Oswald had not returned to the Cuban embassy on Saturday, September 28, and that she had not called the Soviet consulate on his behalf on that day . [239] Then there was a hiatus insofar as cable traffic and telephone wiretaps are concerned, until three days later (on October 1) when an unidentified man called the Soviet embassy saying he was “at your place last Saturday and talked to your consulate” and asked if anything new about the telegram to Washington, D.C., had transpired. Then, strangely, only fourteen minutes later, apparently the same man who had called the Soviet embassy on Saturday, September 28, called saying, “This is Lee Harvey Oswald,” asking again about the telegram they were to send to Washington, D.C. This man again spoke in broken Russian. At 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 2, Oswald departed Mexico City by bus. He arrived in Dallas at 2:20 p.m. on October 3. Then, strangely, an unidentified man phoned the Soviet embassy in Mexico City at 3:39 p.m., speaking in broken Spanish, then English, saying he was looking for a visa to Russia. This man did not identify himself as Oswald. If we assume for the moment that the Russians at the Soviet embassy were telling the truth; and even if we discount Duran’s, Azcue’s, and Contraras’s identifications of Oswald (although neither one described anyone resembling Oswald), we can conclude with a high degree of certainty that there was an Oswald impostor in Mexico City, calling in from the outside on September 28th, along with someone calling herself Silvia Duran. The reasons to support this conclusion are: (a) Oswald spoke fluent, not broken, Russian, and (b) Silvia Duran testified that she did not call the Soviet embassy with Oswald on September 28. Therefore, either there were impersonators of Oswald and Duran, or the telephone transcripts were fabricated by either the CIA or the DFS, or both acting together. It should be added that Colonel Nechiporenko was in the Soviet embassy on Saturday, September 28, and nowhere in his book does he mention a call from Silvia Duran and Oswald on that day. (This was corroborated in an interview with Nechiporenko by Peter Dale Scott in Dallas on November 20, 1993, in which Nechiporenko emphatically denied that there could have been any telephone calls to the Soviet embassy on September 28.) [240] The Strange Absence of Photographs of Oswald in Mexico City "},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"As noted, the CIA could not produce a photograph of Oswald entering or leaving the Soviet or Cuban embassies. The HSCA’s investigator Edwin Lopez wrote: Likelihood that the Photo Surveillance Operation Would have Missed Oswald CIA officers who were in Mexico in 1963 and their Headquarters counterparts generally agreed that it would have been unlikely for the photo surveillance operations to have missed ten opportunities to have photographed Oswald. The transcripts of conversations about or involving Oswald intercepted at the Soviet Embassy reveal that a man later identified as Oswald was at the Cuban Consulate at least three times on Friday and Saturday, September 27 and 28... They also reveal that he was at the Soviet Embassy at least twice on those same days. The CIA technician who serviced the Cuban photographic installations said that it was possible that the operation missed Oswald if: (1) Oswald’s visits were after dark; (2) Oswald’s visits were on Saturday afternoons or Sundays; (3) the case officer had given the photographic base house agents the days off that Oswald visited; (4) the pulse camera was not working. It is known that Oswald’s visits were on a weekday during daylight hours and Saturday morning. This Committee has not been able to determine with certainty, because of the missing production, whether all of the base houses were operating on the days of Oswald’s visits. This Committee believes that the pulse camera was in operation on at least one of the days that Oswald visited (Friday, September 27, 1963) the Cuban Consulate and that the LILYRIC base covering the Soviet gate should have been operating at the time of Oswald’s visits to the Soviet Consulates on September 27th and 28th. Lopez Report, pp. 92-93 (Emphasis added) There is further evidence to prove that photographs of Oswald were never taken. Lopez told Bob Dorff that he personally examined and counted every photographic negative, all numbered in sequence, taken by the CIA cameras before, during, and after the summer and fall of 1963—and that none of the negatives contained a picture of Oswald. Unless the CIA made up a false set of negatives, this is compelling proof that Oswald was never at the Cuban or the Soviet consulates. Moreover, even if a false set of negatives had been created by the CIA, for what purpose would it have been? Why were there no photographs of Oswald? Two possible answers come to mind: (1) The real Oswald did not enter or leave either the Soviet or Cuban consulates; the photographs would have identified an impersonator of Oswald and set off a firestorm of alarm—direct, unquestionable evidence of a conspiracy to set up the Cuban government and/or the Soviets in a plot to assassinate the president of the United States. Or, (2) The photographs might have revealed an Oswald accomplice who was outside one or both of the consulates; but this still would be evidence of a conspiracy of almost equal proportions, and perhaps would be even worse for the conspirators if the accomplice were to be identified as a CIA agent, or if the accomplice’s identity might in some other way unravel the conspiracy. In either case, a false set of negatives would have been required. One can think of other scenarios. But the fact remains that there were no photos or sound recordings of Oswald ever produced for examination by investigators. The exact reasons remain obscure. In any event, clearly there were impersonators of Oswald telephoning in to the Soviet consulate. And the witnesses in the Cuban consulate described someone who was not Oswald. The Nassau Conference A small group of authors and researchers met with Cuban intelligence representatives at the Nassau Beach Hotel on December 7 and 8, 1995. I was fortunate to be invited by Gaeton Fonzi by way of Wayne Smith, head of the Center for International Policy in Washington, D.C. Other authors in attendance were"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Anthony Summers, Peter Dale Scott, Dick Russell, and John Newman, along with Miami Cuban expert Gordon Winslow and other serious researchers. Also at the conference was Jeremy Gunn from the congressional review board. The following Cubans attending the conference were from CEASEN, the Cuban Center for National Security: General Fabian Escalante : Fidel Castro’s chief of personal security—the man who has kept Castro alive over the many years. (See photo of Escalante) Carlos Lechuga : At the time of Oswald’s visit to Mexico City, Lechuga was Cuba’s ambassador to Mexico. He later became Cuba’s ambassador to the United Nations. Arturo Rodriguez Mendoza : Cuban intelligence officer, and a researcher on the JFK assassination. Mira Munzio : Cuban interpreter, also with CEASEN. Each of these Cubans had spent recent years researching the Kennedy assassination. They comprised a very serious group that had done extensive investigative work on this subject. And they came prepared. This was a very informative conference that touched on a wide range of topics relating to the assassination. For this chapter, I will confine the material to that concerning Mexico City. More will be reported in later chapters as pertinent. One of the most significant items that I heard at the conference was the degree to which the Cuban consulate and Cuban embassy had been electronically bugged by the CIA in 1963. The Cubans said that in 1964 they found microphones planted all over the place—in window frames, telephone outlets, furniture —to the extent that it would have been impossible for the CIA not to have heard everything that took place there, including, of course, Oswald’s voice in his conversations with Silvia Duran or Eusebio Azcue. But the CIA has never revealed these conversations. This was confirmed in the HSCA Lopez Report, in which the following redacted material was released in December 1995 (the redacted material is in bold italics): Information Available to the Mexico City Station from [electronic] Surveillance Aimed at the Cuban Diplomatic Compound [An examination of the production from the electronic surveillance of the Cuban diplomatic compound’s telephone failed to reveal any telephone conversations that directly mentioned Oswald or information clearly and directly referred to him.] HSCA, Lopez Report, p. 81 (Emphasis added) This new information is powerful evidence that: (a) there was an Oswald impersonator in the Cuban consulate or (b) neither Oswald nor an impersonator was there. Of these two possibilities, I favor the former—an Oswald impersonator. The latter—no Oswald at all—is extremely unlikely because it would imply that all the people in the Cuban embassy who talked with Oswald or observed him are lying, and in this case they would all presumably have been CIA double agents—a mind-boggling possibility! In the above document we see that the CIA would not let it be known, until forced to do so by the Assassination Records Review Board in 1995, that it did not have a recording of Oswald’s voice in the Cuban consulate, when by all evidence it should have had a recording if Oswald had actually been in the consulate. What we see here is a consistent pattern of the CIA withholding vital information from the American public—for thirty-two years—that would have revealed a conspiracy. And the CIA continues to do so to this day. Much additional material from the Lopez Report is still being withheld. In light of this additional new evidence, it is increasingly obvious that the U.S. government (CIA, FBI, LBJ) suppressed all evidence that there was an Oswald impostor in Mexico City because that would have revealed a conspiracy. This goes back to the Dallas incidents of Oswald impostors, which the FBI and the Warren Commission also would not address. There was a puzzling aspect of the Nassau conference with regard to the Cubans. Although I agreed with their conclusion that Oswald was in Mexico City for the purpose of implicating Cuba in the assassination of Kennedy, I could not agree with their conclusion that it was the real Oswald who was at the Cuban embassy on September 27, 1963. They reached this conclusion despite the fact that both Silvia"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Duran and Azcue did not describe that person as anyone resembling Oswald in their testimonies to the HSCA. I questioned Carlos Lechuga and Arturo Rodriguez about this point. Shrugging their shoulders, they acknowledged that they had no explanation. But they said that they based their conclusion on Silvia Duran’s statements to Cuban officials before she was arrested and interrogated by the Mexican police. As noted earlier, this concerns me because Duran identified Oswald only after seeing his photograph in a newspaper: she would not necessarily have been in a position to make a definitive identification. Duran identified Oswald after she went back to the files in the Cuban consulate and saw his picture on a visa photograph. (The fact that Oswald’s picture was on the visa photograph is not in itself proof that Oswald was at the Cuban consulate. Later in this chapter we will discuss the possibility that Silvia Duran herself, as well as other Cuban embassy employees, was a CIA agent and could easily have inserted Oswald’s visa photograph into the file.) I wondered whether the Cubans might have been motivated to be untruthful about their statement that it was the real Oswald in the Cuban consulate. The Cubans at the conference were certainly not supporters of the CIA. Without equivocation, they stated that the purpose of Oswald’s visit to the Cuban embassy was to incriminate Cuba in a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy. I could not think of a reason why the Cubans were not telling what they actually felt to be true, but I remain puzzled. Is it possible that they are protecting someone? In a written report provided to the conferees (in Spanish, which I had translated into English by one of my assistants), Arturo Rodriguez summarized the Cubans’ position, as follows: Reflecting about this we arrive at the following hypothesis: Everything was prepared to document Oswald’s visit, because there was a plot to implicate Cuba in the assassination which would unfold after the North American response. Nevertheless, almost immediately after the detention of Oswald in Dallas when the investigations began from the main center (of the U.S. government) about the materials concerning Oswald in Mexico, there began to be offered mistaken (wrong) reports. Is it that perhaps upon the unplanned detention (of Oswald) the conspirators dashed to the ground the plan so carefully worked out to incriminate Cuba? For certain is that almost immediately after the murder of Oswald, in the clumsy and hasty conditions known by all, appeared the theory of the “lone assassin,” and the “Cuban conspiracy” (was) passed to the back burner. For what reasons? What were the motives? These are essential questions that the North American authorities should respond to, to the public, when the assassination of John F. Kennedy is clarified, once and for all. The Cubans at the Nassau conference stated several times that they believe that John Kennedy was assassinated by intelligence agencies of the U.S.—i.e., the FBI, the CIA, and/or military intelligence. They stated that they believed that John Kennedy was assassinated because he was planning to make peace with Cuba, and that initial contacts were being arranged between Fidel Castro and the U.S. State Department or a representative of John Kennedy at the very moment that Kennedy was murdered in Dallas. Silvia Duran’s Relationship with Oswald During the 1976 HSCA investigation, information was developed that Silvia Duran had a sexual affair with Oswald when he was in Mexico City. Moreover, witnesses stated that Oswald, along with two other men, had attended a twist dance party in September 1963 at the home of Duran’s cousin, Ruben Duran, at"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"which Silvia Duran was present and which was comprised of Communists and Communist sympathizers. This raises provocative questions: Was this information totally fabricated on paper as part of a plot to incriminate Cuba? Or did it actually happen? Or was it staged by CIA penetration agents? After all, if Oswald were intimate with Silvia Duran and had attended parties with her along with others, and the Mexican and Cuban people who were at the party were Communists, would that not appear to link Cuba to the JFK assassination conspiracy? The Cubans at the conference thought so and strongly expressed that opinion. They said that they believe the information is false, but I remain puzzled. We learn that Silvia Duran herself, according to HSCA documents, admitted to the affair with Oswald, then denied it: In 1965 Elena Garro reported that Silvia Duran had been Oswald’s mistress while he was in Mexico City. In 1967 this report was confirmed by [ ] who talked to Silvia Duran. The CIA Station did not consider the information significant and told the agent to end his contact with Ms. Duran. If that information is accurate, then that Silvia invited Oswald to a party would not have been surprising. Silvia Duran admitted that the Mexican police had questioned her on this point but denied that she had had an affair with Oswald. Ms. Duran denied having any extramarital affairs while she was married to Horacio Duran. This denial is not consistent with evidence of her reputation at the Cuban Consulate. [ ] reported to [ ] that all that would have to be done to recruit Silvia Duran, whom he referred to by using the Spanish word for whore, would be to get a blond blue-eyed American into bed with her. There is also CIA information that indicates that Silvia Duran had an affair with a [ ] in the early 1960s. HSCA, Lopez Report, pp. 253-254 At the Nassau conference, I would learn that the “also” affair of Duran’s which had been redacted from the above report was with none other than Carlos Lechuga, who was at the conference. When Lechuga was asked about this, he denied it with a laugh. In the same conversation, Anthony Summers reported that he had recently talked with Silvia Duran on this subject, and she confirmed that she had had an affair with Lechuga but denied the affair with Oswald, saying that she would never have had an affair with that “little weed.” But numerous CIA documents speak of a sexual affair between Silvia Duran and Oswald. A CIA report dated June 13, 1967, by Winston Scott, chief of station, Mexico City, reads: Headquarters attention is called to paragraphs 3 through 5 of report dated 26 May. The fact that Silvia Duran had sexual intercourse with Lee Harvey Oswald on several occasions when the latter was in Mexico City is probably new, but adds little to the Oswald case. The Mexican police did not report the extent of the Duran-Oswald relationship to this Station. CIA Document 1225-11293 Also, in the CIA’s chronology of Lee Harvey Oswald (obtained by Anna Marie from the National Archives), the following was reported concerning Silvia Duran and Oswald’s alleged attendance at the twist dance party at Ruben Duran’s home on September 2 or 3, 1963. [241] MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION, (Reference 10 Dec 65) between Elena Garro de Paz and Charles Thomas, Political Officer: On 25 December Elena discussed her alleged encounter with Oswald. Also present were Thomas’ wife, and Elena’s daughter, Elenita: Further info was given subsequently on 9 January 66. During this latter conversation, Elena admitted she had gone to American embassy on an earlier occasion with her daughter and mother-in-law and talked to two embassy officers (presumably from LEGAT) about this matter. She said since the embassy officers did not give much credence to anything they said, they did not bother to give a very complete story. The following info supplements and in some instances corrects that given in the memo of Dec 10. Lydia, Horacio, and Ruben Duran are all cousins of Elena. Silvia is married to Horacio, a weak man, who was converted to communism by Ricardo Guerra. Elena has nothing to do with Silvia whom she detests and considers a whore. Ruben was born in"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"U.S. and served in U.S. army during war....Party was held at home of Ruben. Elena believes date of party was 2 or 3 September 63, few days before visit of Soviet astronaut, Gagarin, [242] but is not sure of date.... At the party Oswald wore a black sweater. He tended to be silent and stared at the floor. Two young American companions, one was very tall and slender and had long blond hair which hung across forehead, gaunt face and long protruding chin; other was tall, short light brown hair....All three were obviously Americans and did not mix or dance with other people. The three were friends, because Elena saw them by chance the next day walking down the street together. Although Elena had returned from Europe in June or July, she had already met Eusebio Azcue and knows positively he was at party. On another occasion (not clear whether before or after the party in question), she attended a party where she saw Eusebio Azcue, Emilio Carballido, and a Latin American Negro man with red hair. (These last two were not at the Duran party as was stated in the 10 Dec memo.) Carballido and Azcue, with others, were in heated discussions on that occasion about Kennedy and they came to conclusion that the only solution was to kill him. Elena said Carballido is known as a Castro agent; he had been to Red China, Soviet Union, and many times to Cuba. Following assassination he spent a year in Cuba, then got a job teaching at Rutgers University through Dr. Jose Vasquez Anaral, formerly with Rockefeller Foundation in N.Y. and who is now a professor at Rutgers. The day after assassination, Elenita encountered Señora de Azcue in Sanborne. On seeing her, Señora de Azcue hurried out of store. Azcue was called back to Havana after assassination and his wife followed shortly. CIA’s Oswald Chronology, P 8593, p. 92 In the above testimony by Elena Garro, we see that Oswald was in Mexico City, with other Americans, consorting with Communists at a party on September 2 or 3, 1963. She also claims that she was at another party where Eusebio Azcue was in heated discussions with others to the effect that Kennedy should be killed. The HSCA considered the veracity of Elena Garro: Reviewing the manner in which the CIA Mexico City Station and the Legal Attaché’s office in Mexico City handled Ms. Garro’s allegations reveals that, at best, her allegations were handled in an irresponsible manner because they were dismissed after a superficial investigation. The first report that came to the CIA was misfiled and forgotten. The Legat, after talking to Elena, dismissed her story after interviewing one person whom she said may have been at the party. The manner in which the official American community handled Charles Thomas’ reporting is detailed in Section VI, C., 11, above. Mr. Thomas speculated in 1969 about why Ms. Garro’s story had been largely ignored by the American officials in Mexico: It would appear that whereas the FBI has discounted the Elena Garro allegations, the CIA is still considerable disturbed by them. The CIA may not have pressed for further investigation, however, for a number of reasons: 1) considering the sensitive overlap and subtle competition between two intelligence collecting agencies, it had to yield to the FBI’s clear jurisdiction; 2) there are obvious complications in conducting such an investigation in a foreign country; 3) [ ] and 4) some of the people appearing in the Elena Garro scenario may well be agents of the CIA. Under the circumstances it is unlikely that any further investigation of this matter will ever take place unless it is ordered by a high official in Washington. The Committee attempted to locate Elena Garro. [243] Although the Committee established telephonic contact with Ms. Garro, the Committee was totally frustrated in this aspect of its investigation, but yet believes that there is a possibility that Lee Harvey Oswald did attend a twist party at the home of Ruben Duran . HSCA, Lopez Report, pp. 256, 257 (Emphasis added) Note that the date of the twist party, as Elena Garro vaguely remembers, was September 2 or 3, 1963,"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"nearly a month earlier than Oswald’s known visit to Mexico City. Before trying to bring all of this together, we will examine two other incidents, both quite incredible. The Gilberto Alvarado Ugarte Story On November 26, 1963, just three days after the Kennedy assassination, a seven-page teletype was sent by L. F.

[—-] END OF MSG CIA Document 125-52, p 8593, 26 Nov 1963 ( Emphasis added ) The above disclosure set off a chain reaction in Washington, D.C. As will be discussed in a later chapter, when Lyndon Johnson received it he unquestionably used it as a reason for establishing the Warren Commission, referring to the “documents from Mexico City” and telling reluctant candidates for the Commission, including Earl Warren, of impending nuclear war if it were to be revealed that Cuba was behind the assassination. The next document we have concerning this incident is a teletype from the director of the CIA dated November 28, 1963, just three days after the Alvarado story was sent to Washington, D.C.: 1. ODENVY SAYS THEIR FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION OF OSWALD’S ACTIVITIES HAS PRODUCED “RELIABLE INDICATIONS” THAT HE WAS IN NEW ORLEANS ON 19 2. SEPTEMBER 1963. REPEAT 19 SEPTEMBER 1963. THIS, COUPLED WITH EARLIER EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS IN NEW ORLEANS APPLYING FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ON 17 SEPTEMBER 1963, MEANS OSWALD WOULD HAVE HAD TO FLY TO MEXICO AND BACK BETWEEN 17 AND 19 SEPTEMBER IN ORDER TO BE AT THE CUBAN EMBASSY GETTING HIS PAY OFF, AS ALVARADO CLAIMS, ON 18 SEP. 3. WITH THIS ADDED INFO, BELIEVE NEXT CAN CONFIDENTLY REGARD ALVARADO AS FABRICATOR AND TAILOR INTERROGATION ACCORDINGLY. PERHAPS HE MIGHT RESPOND TO THE SUGGESTION THAT HE HAS BEEN HAVING DELUSIONS AND NEEDS PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT . [246] CIA Document No. 217-87 ( Emphasis added ) ODENVY (pronounced odd envy?—an interesting description of J. Edgar Hoover?) is a code name for the FBI. This is revealed in a CIA document dated November 28, 1963, noting that “ODENVY man Larry Keenan now in Mexico.” Keenan was an FBI agent. Does this sound familiar? Once again we have the FBI shutting down evidence of a conspiracy after only two or three days of investigation and, once again, ignoring the possibility that the person in the Cuban embassy could have been an Oswald impersonator, or actually Oswald himself having been flown from New Orleans to Mexico and back in a private or government aircraft. (This would have been easy for David Ferrie, an experienced airline pilot.) The allegation that Oswald could have flown to Mexico and been at the Cuban consulate in Mexico City on September 18, 1963 has some curious supporting evidence, according to an HSCA report: [247] Mark A. Allen (citing Warren Commission Report documents) wrote that on September 17, 1963 Oswald visited the Mexican consulate in New Orleans and was issued a fifteen-day tourist card. The man whose tourist card was issued directly before Oswald was William George Gaudet, who told the FBI on November 27, 1963 that he was a former employee of the CIA. When Gaudet was interviewed by the FBI, he said that he had left New Orleans on September 19, 1963 via Pan American Airways and that he had not seen Oswald on the plane. But Oswald presumably could have flown to Mexico immediately"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"after getting his tourist card and been there on September 18. Curiously, Gaudet telephoned the FBI office on November 27 stating that he had heard that Jack Ruby from Dallas, Texas, had purchased paintings for one Lorenzo Borenstein. The next evidence we have of the Alvarado story is in a CIA cable dated November 30, 1963, describing the results of the (just noted) instruction for “suggestion” and “psychiatric treatment”: 1. OUR STATION IN MEXICO CITY HAS JUST ADVISED US THAT AT 1230 WASHINGTON TIME TODAY 30 NOVEMBER 1963, GILBERTO ALVARADO, NICARAGUAN, ADMITTED TO MEXICAN SECURITY OFFICIALS IN WRITING THAT HIS WHOLE STORY OF HAVING SEEN LEE OSWALD RECEIVE MONEY IN THE CUBAN EMBASSY IN MEXICO CITY TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT KENNEDY WAS FALSE. HE ADMITTED HE HAD NOT SEEN LEE OSWALD AT ALL AND THAT HE HAD NOT SEEN ANYBODY PAID MONEY IN THE CUBAN EMBASSY. HE ALSO ADMITTED HE HAD NOT TRIED REPEATEDLY TO PHONE A WARNING ABOUT THIS TO THE U.S. EMBASSY IN MEXICO CITY ON 20 SEPTEMBER AS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED. INSTEAD HE HAD FIRST CONTACTED THE U.S. EMBASSY, IN PERSON, ON 25 NOVEMBER, WHEN HE TALKED, AS WE KNOW, TO THE EMBASSY SECURITY OFFICER. 2. ALVARADO STILL CLAIMS THAT HE DID REPEATEDLY VISIT THE CUBAN EMBASSY TO SECURE FALSE DOCUMENTATION TO GO TO CUBA FOR SABOTAGE TRAINING (APPARENTLY AS A NICARAGUAN AGENT, ALTHOUGH THE NICARAGUAN SECURITY SERVICE DENIES THIS). MEXICAN AUTHORITIES ARE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT PART OF ALVARADO’S STORY. 3. ALVARADO SAID THAT HIS MOTIVE IN TELLING THIS FALSE STORY ABOUT SEEING OSWALD PAID MONEY IN THE CUBAN EMBASSY WAS TO HELP HIMSELF GET TO THE UNITED STATES SO HE COULD PARTICIPATE IN ACTION AGAINST FIDEL CASTRO. HE SAYS HE HATES CASTRO AND THOUGHT THAT HIS STORY ABOUT OSWALD, IF BELIEVED, WOULD HELP CAUSE THE U.S.A. TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST CASTRO. 4. OUR MEXICO CITY STATION IS INFORMING THE LEGAL ATTACHÉ OF THE U.S. EMBASSY OF THIS INFORMATION. CIA Record No. 104-10015-10253 ( Emphasis added ) It is interesting to note that Alvarado said that the reason he told this story was to cause the U.S. to take action against Cuba! This, of course, is exactly what appears to be the reason for the whole Mexico City affair, as well as for the Oswald impersonators in Dallas. What Alvarado did not say was who helped him fabricate the story and who ordered him to tell it. It should be noted that Alvarado himself stated that he was a Nicaraguan secret service agent. With the CIA’s ability to penetrate virtually any intelligence agency in the world, it would not be surprising if Alvarado were also a CIA double agent. [248] Thus, within eight days after the assassination, all of this evidence of conspiracy involving the Cubans was shunted aside. [249] However, the above teletype did not tell the whole story. Another CIA document dated December 10, 1963 reported the results of an FBI/DFS/CIA interrogation of Alvarado on December 5 and 6, using “technical” means, which by the wording in the lengthy report presumably meant lie detector tests, at least. The tests were given in a “covert location.” The report stated: The questions asked during testing which indicated deception and thus possible fabrication are as follows: Did you see a large sum of money on September 18? (Tuesday) Yes."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":" Did you see this money given to a person you described as Oswald? Yes. In the Cuban Consulate, did you hear someone say $6,500? Yes. Did you hear someone say, “I can kill him!” Yes. Note : This question was asked twice. Once Subject was shown a photograph of Oswald taken by the New Orleans police in 1959. The next time Subject was shown a photograph of Oswald which appeared in the local newspapers after the assassination. The report stated: “Based on the technical interrogation, it is the opinion of the examiner that Subject was not truthful in relating the incidents of the 18th of September.” The report went on: After technical testing and further interrogation, Subject finally admitted that he could have made an “honest mistake.” This examiner told Subject that the test results indicated that he was lying and that the “apparatus” was calling Subject a liar. Subject’s reply to this was that he had respect for the apparatus and if that was what it said then that must be so. It is not clear what “further interrogation” meant. Of course, it could have involved anything from hypnosis, drugs, beatings, etc.; and the results of the lie detector tests could simply have been rigged— perhaps not uncommon for the FBI, the DFS, and the CIA in those days. The Gilberto P. Lopez Story What appears to be yet another disinformation scheme to implicate Castro’s Cuba is revealed in two CIA documents released unredacted on December 1, 1995. The first document, a teletype dated November 30, 1963 from CIA headquarters to the Mexico City station, read: HQS HAS RECEIVED REPORT THAT ON DAY OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY’S ASSASSINATION (22 NOV) CUBANA AIRCRAFT DELAYED ITS DEPARTURE MEXICO CITY FIVE HOURS FROM 1700 TO 2200 AWAITING IMPORTANT PASSENGER WHO ARRIVED MEXICO CITY AIRPORT IN PRIVATE TWIN MOTOR AIRCRAFT AT 2130 HOURS MEXI TIME.

CIA Document Number 279-683"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"These teletypes strongly suggest very suspicious activities involving Cuba in the assassination plot. When we combine this with the other stories—Oswald receiving $6,500 in the Cuban embassy, Oswald at the Communist twist dance party with two companions, Oswald’s visits to the Cuban and Soviet consulates, and Oswald’s supposed sexual affair with Cuban consulate receptionist Silvia Duran—we have either an elaborate disinformation scheme or evidence that Castro’s Cuba ordered the murder of the president of the United States and left a trail leading to themselves littered with “evidence” that could not be ignored. This was discussed at the Nassau conference. The Cubans stated that the delayed flight from Mexico City to Havana never happened. They dismissed it as being impossible to have happened without them knowing about it. Furthermore, on its face, it is ridiculous to seriously think that Castro would be behind such a plot paraded before the world, inviting his total destruction. Castro has not survived all these years without being prudent, calculating, and careful. What sort of a group or organization had the capability and would be in a position to lay down such a disinformation scheme? This brings us to consideration of evidence that the CIA had double agents in the Cuban embassy. CIA Double Agents in Mexico City We now have proof of CIA double agents in Mexico City. This is not surprising. Included in the December 1995 release of CIA documents was a cable originating from B. Reichardt through the director of the CIA to the Mexico City station: REF MEXI 7160 (in 70522) [250] 1. STATION’S DOUBLE AGENTS OBVIOUSLY CANNOT DIRECT POINTED QUESTION TO C/O’S BUT SHOULD BE ALERT TO AND REPORT ANY COMMENTS ON ASSASSINATION. PERHAPS CAN PROVOKE DISCUSSION BY INNOCUOUS QUESTIONS AS TO GENERAL EFFECT EVENTS EXPECTED TO HAVE ON INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. 2. IN INSTRUCTING AGENTS STATION SHOULD NOT OF COURSE MAKE ANY REFERENCE TO OSWALD/ DURAN/ ALVARADO ET AL. OR TO INVESTIGATIVE MEASURES BEING TAKEN. CIA Document Number 258-668 Silvia Duran has been suspected of being a CIA agent planted in the Cuban embassy. Also, Luisa Calderon is similarly a suspect, along with other candidates. Moreover, the CIA had double agents who had the means to contact the Soviet embassy, as indicated above. There is also the likelihood that the CIA had penetration agents in the Soviet embassy in Mexico City. Why not? The CIA had double agents in the KGB in Moscow and even had the Kremlin bugged! Mexico City should have been simple for them. The HSCA questioned David Atlee Phillips concerning CIA double agents in Mexico City. Remember, Phillips was chief of covert actions in the Cuban section in the Mexico City station in 1963 and is one of the prime suspects in the JFK assassination conspiracy. He was also—by profession, by training, and by disposition—an accomplished, if not congenital, liar. From the Lopez Report, quoting Phillips: “At one time the agency pitched almost everyone at the Cuban Embassy.” Mr. Phillips stated that he had first heard Duran’s name from the telephone intercept transcripts. But Mr. Phillips asserted"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"that the CIA had no interest in Ms. Duran because “she wasn’t friendly with anyone.” Mr. Phillips had previously mentioned the CIA Mexico City Station’s interest in recruiting a former Cuban Ambassador to Mexico named Lechuga. Mr. Phillips was shown a memorandum written by W. David Slawson of the Warren Commission staff regarding a trip to Mexico by Warren Commission staff members which said: Mr. Scott’s (chief of the CIA station in Mexico City) narrative disclosed that the CIA’s action immediately after the assassination consisted basically of alerting all its confidential sources of information throughout Mexico to immediately channel all information into their headquarters, and of compiling as complete dossiers as possible on Oswald and everyone else throughout Mexico who at that time the CIA knew had had some contact with Oswald...This meant especially Silvia Duran, who because she had previously been having an affair with Lechuga, the former Cuban Ambassador to Mexico and presently the Cuban representative at the United Nations, had previously been of substantial interest to the CIA ... HSCA, Lopez Report, p. 198 When confronted with this, Phillips showed surprise, saying, “No one let me in on this operation.” He added that he doubted that Duran would have been pitched (attempts made to recruit) because the station could not identify any of her weaknesses; but when he was confronted with a statement from one of the station’s assets who had reported to his case officer “that all that would have to be done to recruit Ms. Duran was to get a blonde, blue-eyed American to go to bed with her,” Phillips said that it did indeed sound as if the station had targeted her for recruitment, but he still held to his position that he had never heard of her being pitched. The HSCA finally gave up, stating: “...the Committee cannot definitely resolve whether Silvia Duran was a Mexican or American intelligence source.” However, the committee did find a tenuous possibility that Silvia Duran was a Cuban intelligence agent, in information from CIA officer Barney Hidalgo, who had traveled to Mexico City in 1963: Mr. Hidalgo, professing not to remember all the details, stated that he thought that Duran was a Cuban intelligence agent. Hidalgo said: At the time when this contact told me of Silvia Duran I tied the two together, yes, sir. I don’t know, how at that time it was obvious to me as an intelligence agent that there was some connection there but it was of no interest whatsoever to me. I do remember that when I next saw this contact of mine I mentioned the fact to him and let him proceed to do whatever he wanted to. HSCA, Lopez Report, pp. 201-202 The HSCA concluded: “...with no corroborative evidence for Mr. Hidalgo’s memory, the Committee must conclude that Silvia Duran was probably never employed by Cuban intelligence.” Only recently have I come across part of a CIA document dated May 26, 1967 that provides inferential evidence that Silvia Duran may have been a CIA asset in the Cuban embassy. It pertains to a meeting in a CIA safehouse with a man who is presumably a CIA penetration agent in Cuban intelligence. It reads: 3. [ ] then stated that he was doing his best to keep active certain contacts he had had in the past that were on the periphery of the official Cuban circle. He mentioned specifically the case of Silvia and Horacio Durán that then explained the background of his relationship with them. He related that Silvia Durán worked as a receptionist at the Consulate in 1963-64 and was on duty when Lee Harvey Oswald applied for a visa. She had been recommended to the Cubans by Teresa Proenza, the Press Attaché from 1959 until 1962. [ ] described Teresa Proenza as a Cuban ______? About 52, a Lesbian, and a member of the Communist Party of Cuba, who was currently in jail in Cuba as the result of a conviction for espionage on behalf of CIA .

[ ] continued that just the other day Silvia Durán had telephoned [ ] and that.... NARA, per 102-626 JFK, released 1/9/94 ( Emphasis added ) Teresa Proenza is now a subject of study by researchers as a potentially important key to the Mexico City Kennedy assassination puzzle. It must be apparent to the reader that attempts of historical researchers to deal with the multiple scenarios of double and triple agents in the world of espionage is likely to be an exercise in futility. So how can we reach a point where we can proceed with this information to glean something of value in this investigation? Basing our conclusions on CIA documents and all of the other evidence, we can say with certainty that the CIA had double agents and plants in the Cuban embassies and the Soviet embassies. Unfortunately, this makes practically any scenario possible. Compounding the confusion, there are serious questions as to the reliability of parts of Nechiporenko’s book. To be realistic, we must consider the possibility that the CIA has had the KGB’s cooperation, from the day of the assassination, to cover up a conspiracy. It is reasonable to me that the CIA (or Lyndon Johnson) could have contacted the KGB or Khrushchev immediately after the assassination to make such an arrangement, ostensibly to prevent nuclear war. It also places us in the position of not being able to believe much of anything from Cuban or Soviet intelligence, or what any of the witnesses say, or anything said by the CIA. Is it completely hopeless? Maybe not. The cable traffic in and out of the Soviet and Cuban consulates is probably genuine because it reveals details of conspiracy that the CIA was attempting to hide for thirty years. Also, the statements of Gilberto Alvarado and Elena Garro, even if completely fabricated, are of considerable evidentiary value because they were revealed within three days after the assassination, in intricate detail (only part of their statements have been included here). It seems evident that if fabricated, the statements must have been designed with great care before the assassination. Further, inasmuch as the stories implicate Cuba in the assassination, they must have been designed by the conspirators: Who else would the conspirators be but CIA elements, located at a high level in the Mexico City station, perhaps working with double agents in the Cuban and Soviet consulates? Summary of Key Points of Chapter 19 1) The evidence leads to the inescapable conclusion that Oswald’s trip to Mexico City was part of a grand scheme to set up Cuba as a false sponsor of the Kennedy assassination. It was a continuation of staged or fabricated events starting with Oswald in New Orleans, in Dallas, and then Mexico City. It has all of the earmarks of a covert intelligence operation of the kind in which David Atlee Phillips, a.k.a. Maurice Bishop, specialized. 2) It is possible, although not proven, that an elaborate covert operation in Mexico City penetrated the Cuban and Soviet embassies with CIA double agents and staged (with real people) some or all of the events (such as the passing of $6,500 inside the Cuban embassy, the twist dance party at which Oswald was present, and Oswald’s supposed sexual affair with Silvia Duran)—all with the intention of incriminating Cuba. 3) The most convincing evidence of CIA culpability in Mexico City is (a) the wiretap on September 28th, which revealed compound evidence of an Oswald impostor; (b) the inability of the CIA to produce recordings of Oswald’s voice or his photographs entering and leaving the Soviet and"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Cuban consulates when the CIA desperately wanted to prove that Oswald was in the consulate, and had elaborate, automatic electronic and photographic equipment in place; (c) the mere existence of the Alvarado and Garro stories and the Gilberto Lopez story, which were either true and staged or were fabricated before the assassination (in either event, revealing a conspiracy to implicate Cuba); (d) David Atlee Phillips’ meeting with Oswald in Dallas in early September 1963 which strongly implies that he and the CIA were directly involved in the plot. 4) The FBI participated extensively in the Mexico City cover-up, cooperating with the CIA. This is a continuation of the pattern of the FBI’s participation in the Dallas cover-up, and the New Orleans cover-up as well. 5) A question concerning David Atlee Phillips’ role requires clarification: If Phillips was Oswald’s handler and the mind behind the disinformation scheme to set him up, why did the CIA fail to get photographs, bugs, or wiretaps of Oswald in the Cuban consulate at any time? One possible answer is that Phillips did not know about the CIA electronic surveillance of the Cuban consulate and therefore was not concerned about using an Oswald impersonator in the consulate. But one would presume that Phillips, head of Cuban operations in the Mexico City CIA station, certainly would have known of the surveillance. Another more plausible answer is that it was never intended for knowledge of the CIA electronics surveillance operations to become known to the public—its revelation was a bureaucratic snafu, caused by an unknowing clerk who searched the files looking for Oswald and found one that was not supposed to have been filed, but that contained a photo and description of someone obviously not resembling Oswald. This could explain Phillips’ panic after the assassination and his initial attempts to bribe the Cuban consulate staff to say that Oswald was there, only later to tell Veciana that everything had been taken care of once the decision had been made by LBJ, Hoover, and the CIA to scrap the scheme to pin the crime on Castro, because by then the perfect plan was coming apart at the seams. (CIA covert operations, as history has shown, have often been fiascos.) 6) Although one can imagine a relatively innocent scenario that would exonerate the CIA—such as the operations in New Orleans, Dallas, and Mexico City having been designed only to discredit the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and then co-opted by others as a perfect cover for assassinating Kennedy—it hardly seems plausible. Such manufacturing of benign scenarios to get the CIA off the hook ultimately becomes absurd. Would the CIA or the FBI play such a dangerous game solely to discredit the Fair Play for Cuba Committee? The objective, it seems, must have been much larger— to provide a false sponsor for the assassination of President Kennedy and to precipitate an invasion of Cuba. Unless further evidence develops to the contrary, it seems reasonable to conclude that a radical faction, at a middle to high level in the CIA, was involved in the assassination of John Kennedy. In this scenario, the sheep-dipping of Oswald in New Orleans would have been conducted by an agency of the U.S. government to discredit the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, but somewhere along the line, probably in Dallas, it was picked up by CIA radicals to provide cover for their plot to assassinate Kennedy. This does not leave J. Edgar Hoover out of the conspiracy. Nor Lyndon Johnson. My thesis continues that these two were probably not involved in the planning details; i.e., they were informed only that the assassination of John Kennedy was going to happen and of the role they would jointly be required to play, which was to orchestrate a convincing cover-up if found to be necessary. More analysis will be presented concerning this thesis and the culpability of the CIA in chapters that follow. Although there is much more that can be said about Oswald’s trip to Mexico City, I must leave that for others. We will now examine other evidence of CIA and Mafia involvement in the Kennedy assassination"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"—the fascinating mystery of the French Connection. *** Epilogue On October 1, 1996, a 192-page HSCA document was released by the Assassination Records Review Board which provided considerable corroborating evidence of the preceding material. It contained the testimony of John Scelso (a pseudonym), a high-ranking intelligence officer in the CIA who was superior in rank to Mexico City Station Chief Winston Scott. Scelso testified: “At the time of the Kennedy assassination, I was chief of the branch responsible for operation in Mexico City and Central America, including Panama.” Scelso testified that James Angleton had immediately gone into action to do all the investigation and that Richard Helms had called a meeting and told Angleton and others that he (Scelso) was in charge; everybody should report everything to Scelso and no one should have any conversation with anyone without Scelso being present. Scelso said that this “was violated from the word go by Angleton” who “dealt with the FBI, the Warren Commission, and John Foster Dulles himself.” Scelso complained to Helms who told him he had no control over Angleton. Scelso said that Angleton had “enormously influential contacts with J. Edgar Hoover,” that he had his own direct line. Scelso testified that he wrote a report about two days after the assassination, that Helms took to President Johnson, in which was stated that there was “no visible indication that he [Oswald] was a Cuban or Soviet agent” and that there was “no indication [in Mexico City] that there had been other participants in the assassination.” Scelso also said that the Ugarte incident was a fabrication. He said that in a meeting with the FBI and Helms, Angleton criticized his report “terribly.” Scelso said “I just sat there and I did not say a word. This was a typical Angleton performance....” Scelso stated that Helms’ failure to inform the Warren Commission of the Castro assassination plots was “a morally, highly reprehensible act.” He said that the Mexico City support apparatus—phone taps, photo surveillance—“was unequaled in the world.” In the latter part of his testimony, Scelso was extremely critical of William Harvey, describing him as a thug and a wacko, whom he suspected of being the one who murdered Sam Giancana. Scelso also testified that he suspected Angleton of having ties to organized crime. This shocking statement has large ramifications in light of recent evidence that Oswald may have been part of an Angleton operation out of CIA’s counter-intelligence division. (This will be examined in Chapter 28.) It seems apparent that Helms was ordered to take the investigation away from Scelso and turn it over to Angleton, who would do the bidding of Hoover. More and more we see that Hoover had his allies and agents within the CIA, leaving open the possibility of combined FBI/CIA-radical factions in a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy, in concert with the Mafia. *** An important disclosure was sent to me by Bob Dorff in June 1997. Anthony Summer, in researching his new book on Richard Nixon, found a portion of an HSCA deposition of E. Howard Hunt on November 3, 1978, in which Hunt answered a question concerning the radical anti-Castro Cuban organization DRE —with which Oswald had been associated in New Orleans: Mr. Hunt: The DRE. Dave Phillips ran that for us. But that is classified, I think. He was the head of it.... The importance of this is that it links Oswald’s activities in New Orleans to Phillips and the CIA; also, to Dallas—the DRE safe-house on Hollandale Street, and gun running involving Jack Ruby—adding to the credibility of the evidence that Phillips was the Maurice Bishop who met Oswald in Dallas. Moreover, it places Phillips even more deeply in the JFK assassination plot. (See Chapter 26 for more on the DRE in Dallas.)"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Assassination is not a subject on which one would expect many records or documents to be made or retained.... Should we try to silence those who are talking or might later talk? 1967 Inspector General’s Report on Plotting against Castro, National Archives 20 ZR/RIFLE AND THE FRENCH CONNECTION The evidence of the CIA’s ZR/RIFLE program to assassinate foreign leaders has importance because it potentially links the CIA, right-wing extremists (in Dallas and New Orleans), Jack Ruby, Oswald, the French Union Corsica (the European branch of the international crime syndicate), and the French OAS (L’Orginisation de l’Armie Secrete) to the JFK assassination. It involves a complex cast of characters who operated with code names, false identities, and forged files with false dates, making their traceability very difficult if not impossible. One of the techniques used was to employ false names that were in fact other real people who had reputations that would make them suspects for the crime. Eager investigators would track down a suspect only to find that person having a perfect alibi. In Chapter 16, CIA and Mafia Overview , I outlined a plausible scenario for the execution phase of the Kennedy assassination which involved rogue elements of the CIA and their Mafioso counterparts in the CIA’s program to assassinate Fidel Castro. What follows is an extension of that scenario and an analysis of how it might have involved the recruitment of French Corsican assassins through the Mafia in Marseilles, France. Also to be discussed are allegations that part of the assassination team was recruited from the radical French OAS organization that had been involved in plots to assassinate French President Charles de Gaulle. These terrorists opposed Kennedy because of his long-standing support for a free Algeria. The first conclusive evidence of CIA plots to assassinate foreign leaders was in a November 20, 1975 report by the Senate Select Committee which was studying governmental operations with respect to intelligence activities; the committee, more commonly known as the Church Committee, was headed by Senator Frank Church. This report drew extensively on a 1967 report by the CIA inspector general on CIA plots against Fidel Castro. It was not until January 8, 1994 that the complete inspector general’s report became public by release from the National Archives. I obtained copies of both the Church Committee’s report and the inspector general’s report and have drawn on that material in this discussion, along with other sources that will be cited. Going into Business It was probably in 1959, or at the latest 1960, that the Executive Branch of the U.S. government, using the CIA as its instrument, decided to go into the business of murdering foreign leaders. Records show that this idea was probably proposed to President Eisenhower by Allen Dulles in 1959. The main subject of concern at that time was Patrice Lumumba of the Belgian Congo, who was considered to be dangerously leading that country into communism. Having experienced the fall of Cuba to communism and Fidel Castro, the Eisenhower administration, the military, and the CIA were gravely concerned that many more Third World countries would follow. Whether or not President Eisenhower specifically ordered Patrice Lamumba to be executed is not clear, but it seems certain that he knew about the plans. In these discussions, it is important to keep in mind that use of “plausible deniability” greatly affects an understanding of how it would be possible for rogue elements of the CIA to take it upon themselves to assassinate the president of the United States. Prevalent throughout CIA documents are the use of plausible-deniability terms, such as “get rid of Castro,” “do something drastic about this man,” “eliminate"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"that person,” etc., which could later be said to have meant something other than actual murder. Operatives within the CIA would not even tell their superiors specifically what they were doing, and they would employ such potentially misleading terminology even with their subordinates and assassin squads. This worked all the way to the top of the CIA, where even the director would not be told what was going on in certain clandestine operations. And if presidents were involved in such activities, it would have been discussed on a one-to-one basis, with nothing in writing between Allen Dulles and the president. It takes little imagination to see the possibility that this operational philosophy could lead to disastrous, unintended consequences, such as certain marginally sane rogues within the CIA deciding that those above them would like to see Kennedy dead and that they should, on their own, proceed to do the deed and not tell their superiors anything about it before the fact, thus presenting their superiors with a fait accompli and forcing them either to cover up the abominable act or preside over the dismantling of their CIA. This form of plausible deniability has been used throughout history by heads of state and crime chieftains when ordering executions. A simple utterance of a code phrase or nod of the head or lift of a finger would be sufficient for the underlings to do their work. It seems reasonable that Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover could have been involved in the plot in a similar, deliberate manner without their knowing the details of the plot. They would know only that it was going to happen and be given only the briefest outline of what their potential roles could become in the event certain items needed to be covered up. The initial term of the CIA for assassination of foreign leaders was “Executive Action.” According to William Harvey’s testimony, it was the brilliant and articulate Richard Bissell who first initiated the programs after the White House twice urged Bissell to “create such a capability.” (This was in some dispute in Bissell’s testimony to the Church Committee. He recalled that “while he could have created the capability on his own, any urgings would have come from Bundy or Walt Rostow [both at the White House].”) [251] The assassination programs included sub-programs for recruitment of professional assassins; the development of specialized knowledge of assassination planning; the development of James-Bondish weapons such as long-range, high-powered rifles with telescopes and silencers, deadly poisons and their delivery methods, machine guns with silencers; and on and on. The subprograms also included the development of knowledge on crowd reactions to events in motorcades, and mass psychological control of entire populations. More sinister yet, a massive project was undertaken to develop programmed assassins using hypnosis and drugs and other mind-control techniques. Specific objectives were outlined in writing to see if it were possible to produce “Manchurian Candidates” for either assassination missions or “programmed patsy missions.” The decision to recruit help from the Mafia in assassination plots was made in 1960. [252] A document released by the National Archives on May 5, 1994 sheds light on who first proposed the idea: Bissell and Edwards both expressed the belief that Dulles (and his deputy, General Cabell) authorized the initial phase of the assassination plot involving underworld figures. They acknowledged, however, that Dulles (and his deputy) were not told about the plot until after the underworld figures had been contacted. The words said to have been used to brief them—“an intelligence operation”—do not convey on their face that the plot involved assassination, although Bissell and Edwards insist the real meaning must have been understood. There is some other evidence which can be said both to suggest that Dulles and Cabell did know and to suggest that they did not know. SSCI(A)—JFK Collection: HSCA (RG 233) Also, Allen Dulles (along with Richard Helms) was the one who first proposed massive experimentation in mind control using, among other things, LSD and hypnosis (sometimes on unwitting subjects) for creation of the “Manchurian Candidates” or patsies. It seems beyond a doubt that Allen"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Dulles should be viewed in history as the man who, more than anyone else, was responsible for the conception and implementation of these two programs that pushed the United States over the brink into despicable criminal activity of the worst sort. One of the theses of this book is that unintended consequences of these criminal programs resulted in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. (For example, the government’s partnership with the Mafia, to use Sam Giancana’s words—as reported in the Inspector General’s Report—would put the government “over a barrel” when the time came to prosecute the Mafia. [253] This could have emboldened the Mafia to proceed with its plot to assassinate the president, knowing that the government would be forced to cover it up.) I found it useful to prepare a chronological list of the major political assassination plots in the 1960s. I thought that it might yield patterns of insight into the political or economic nature of the murders: Note: The use of the word “sponsor” in the following chronological list is not intended to imply at this point in our narrative that agents of the CIA actually pulled the trigger or performed the murders. But it does imply that the CIA was behind and supportive of the plots, and decisively aided in their conception, promotion, and execution. (This was the conclusion of the Church Committee.)

The first two attempts that used poisons or toxins did not work, primarily due to inability to deliver them. This might counter the assertions of many that if the CIA had wanted to kill John Kennedy, it could have poisoned him, or blown up his limousine; that never would gunfire have been used. One answer could be that only gunfire had worked in their previous plots. I also noted that the assassinations of John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, Jr., all occurred under the reigns of J. Edgar Hoover and Lyndon Johnson, and that Robert Kennedy’s and Martin Luther King, Jr.’s assassinations occurred in rapid succession in 1968 when it became apparent that Robert Kennedy would likely capture the presidency; and they occurred before Johnson left office. Who had the motives to want all three assassinated? Obviously, J. Edgar Hoover. Also, because of King’s agressive campaign to get the U.S. out of Vietnam and his promotion of racial integration, the extreme right wing had motives. Less obvious was LBJ’s motive to have King killed, because he was leaving office. Also less obvious was the Mafia’s motive, other than that Carlos Marcello was a racist. I further noted that all of these assassination plots of foreign presidents had a common factor— economic interests of major U.S. corporations: oil companies (Southeast Asia), ITT (Chile), and the United Fruit Company (Dominican Republic), as examples. The French Connection The first information concerning the French connection began to surface in 1975 when the Church Committee began looking into the CIA “Executive Action” program known as ZR/RIFLE. Former CIA Director Richard Helms spoke at length to the committee about ZR/RIFLE. Of particular interest were two members of the ZR/RIFLE team identified by Helms using their code names— WI/ROGUE and QJ/WIN. The committee gathered evidence indicating that WI/ROGUE was a soldier of fortune and a criminal. The Church Committee Report described WI/ROGUE as follows: WI/ROGUE was an “essentially stateless” soldier of fortune, “a forger and former bank robber .” (Inspector General Memo, 3/14/75) The CIA sent him to the Congo after providing him with plastic surgery and a toupee so that Europeans traveling in the Congo would not recognize him. (I.G. Memo, 3/14/75) The CIA characterized WI/ROGUE as a man who “learns quickly and carries out any assignment without regard for danger.” (CIA Cable, Africa Division to Leopoldville, 10/27/60) CIA’s Africa Division recommended WI/ROGUE as an agent in the following terms: He is indeed aware of the precepts of right and wrong, but if he is given an assignment which may be morally wrong in the eyes of the world, but necessary because his case officer ordered him to carry it out, then it is right, and he will dutifully undertake appropriate action for its execution"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"without pangs of conscience. In a word, he can rationalize all actions. Church Committee Report, pp. 43-44 ( Emphasis added ) In his testimony to the Church Committee, Richard Helms described QJ/WIN: “If you need somebody to carry out murder I guess you had a man who might be prepared to carry it out.” [255] A direct link of Helms to William Harvey and QJ/WIN is shown in a memorandum from Helms to Harvey which I obtained from the Assassination Archives in Washington, D.C. It reads: 19 February 1962 MEMORANDUM FOR: William A. Harvey SUBJECT: Authorization of ZRRIFLE Agent Activities 1. For the purpose of ZRRIFLE activities, you are hereby authorized to retain the services of Principal Agent QJWIN and such other principal agents and sub-agents as may be required. This authorization will continue to be in force through 31 December 1962, subject to renewal at that time. 2. As established by contract with him, QJWIN’s salary will be $7,200 per annum. Accounting for the expenses of QJWIN and other agents involved in this activity will be in the form of receipts for funds received by them, and these receipts will be retained in the ZRRIFLE covert operational file. Because of the sensitive nature of this activity, accounting for funds will be by general category and by your certification. In addition to the salary established for QJWIN, you are authorized the expenditure of $7,500 through 31 December 1962. If further funds are necessary, they will be provided. 3. This memorandum is to be considered in lieu of project and constitutes authorization for all travel, per diem, operational and other expenses. 4. It is requested that this activity be handled strictly on an EYES ONLY basis. / signed / Richard Helms Deputy Director (Plans) The committee report described QJ/WIN as the principal agent of ZR/RIFLE. For a period of a year and a half, QJ/WIN was contacted sporadically by the CIA chief of station in Luxembourg, Belgium, on behalf of the Bureau of Narcotics (now called the Drug Enforcement Agency—DEA). Documents found later by Anna Marie show that QJ/WIN’s employment by the CIA goes back to 1958 when the CIA considered him as an “agent provocateur or a double agent against the Soviets.” According to CIA documents, QJ/WIN’s relationship with the CIA lasted six years. He was terminated on February 14, 1964, about three months after John Kennedy was assassinated. The termination document reads: DISPATCH TO: Chief [ ] ATTN: [ ] FROM: Chief of Station [ ] SUBJECT: QJWIN Termination [ ] 14 February 1964 1. QJWIN has been terminated. [ ] told him on 21 April that the operation in which he was to play a role had been shelved and therefore his contract, which ran out on 29 February, was not renewed. He was reassured that this action did not result from anything he had done and his past cooperation was appreciated.

Attachment [ ] Were these documents concerning QJ/WIN forged to cover his true description and activities, or are they real? In either case, there appears to be no question that QJ/WIN was a key element—a most important CIA operative—who could have been either involved in or knowledgeable of the Kennedy assassination plot. I decided to develop a description of QJ/WIN, as detailed as available information permitted, and see where it would lead.

As I continued my investigation, I would use this list in hope of establishing the identity of QJ/WIN. Harvey’s Notes for Concept of ZR/RIFLE Upon receiving his assignment to develop and implement assassination capability for the CIA, William Harvey sat down with a note pad and outlined the design of the project—its objectives, personnel, security provisions, etc. He outlined his thoughts concerning how to recruit outside professional assassins and what their qualifications should be. These notes are fascinating. They show the workings of the fertile, logical mind of one of our nation’s master spies in designing the program that may have been co-opted later to assassinate John F. Kennedy. The notes clearly set forth the management concepts of ZR/RIFLE. Although the notes are undated, most likely they were written sometime in 1962 because they mention that QJ/WIN was already under a written CIA contract. Inasmuch as this contract was apparently authorized on February 19, 1962, it seems safe to conclude the notes were made after that date. The notes state that QJ/WIN had previously worked for one and a half years for the Bureau of Narcotics under the supervision of Charles Siragusa (who would later become involved in the CIA’s MK/ULTRA mind- control program). As early as 1960, QJ/WIN’s expenses were being paid by the CIA through William Harvey. The notes state that QJ/WIN was first contacted in 1958 through the Bureau of Narcotics. This leads to suspicion that the Bureau of Narcotics and the CIA were very close in nefarious joint-venture, covert operations during this period, including the mind-control program. Numerous CIA documents show that Harvey was involved with QJ/WIN and was involved in recruiting spies or assassins in the early 1960s, before the February 19, 1962 contract. In any event, the notes clearly lay out the beginning concept of the CIA’s assassination programs, whether or not the notes were written in 1962."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Exhibit 20-1.

Agents will be spotted in several areas, including the United States, but for operational security reasons will probably not be used in their countries of residence. Present developmental activity is being conducted in the WE [Western Europe] and EE [Eastern Europe] areas, but it is anticipated that this will be extended to other division areas. The project will be operated against third-country installations and personnel. 2) [Note to reader: The following statement of “objective” was obviously written by Harvey to conceal the true nature of the project. The Church Committee and the inspector general confirm this. There is no doubt that these notes are for Project ZR/RIFLE and for assassinations.] Objective : The objective of this project is the procurement of code and cipher materials [read professional assassins] and information concerning such materials, in accordance with requirements levied on the clandestine services, primarily by the National Security Agency [NSA]. Since these requirements are subject to frequent revision, no listing of targets would be valid for the duration of the project. Specific operations will be mounted on the basis of need and opportunity. The project will be conducted by Division D with assistance from area divisions and stations as needed. 3) Background : In response to the increasing requirements for the operational procurement of freight code and cipher materials, Division D in 1960 began the spotting of agent assets as a developmental activity. During the same period requirements from NSA became more refined and, in many respects, more sensitive. Because most stations are not equipped to conduct this type of operation and because of the desirability of completely centralized control over this entire effort, it was determined that Division D, which is in closest touch with NSA on procurement requirements, could best conduct the activity. The spotting activity has now advanced far enough to justify removing from the DDA [Deputy Director of Administration] category. 4) Operational Assets: (1) Personnel: QJWIN is under written contract as a principal agent, with the primary task of spotting agent candidates. QJWIN was first contacted in 1958 through the Chief of the Luxembourg I.S. by the Chief of Station, Luxembourg, in connection with an illegal narcotics operation into the United States. For a period of a year and a half he was contracted sporadically by COS [Chief of Station] Luxembourg, in behalf of the Bureau of Narcotics. Files of this Bureau reflect an excellent performance by QJWIN. In October 1960 [portion blanked out] QJWIN annual salary: $7,200 Travel & operational expense for QJWIN and other agents and agent candidates: $2,000 Fees for services by and standby of agents and agent candidates: $2,000 Travel of staff employees engaged in ZR/RIFLE activity: $2,500 Hire of safe houses, automobiles, and other operational expenses: $1,000 Pay for agents or completion of jobs? $14,700 1) Legal, ethical -- morale, operational problems; political; non-attributability. 2 ) Our own experience (Bangkok) (and effect on DDP [Deputy Director of Plans]) and experience w/KBG (Croisup, Bandera groups, Khokhlso?) require most professional, proven"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"operationally competent, ruthless, stable, CE-experienced [counter espionage] OPC officers (few available), able to conduct patient search and w/guts to pull back if instinct or knowledge tells him he should, and w/known high regard for operational security assessments. 3) Maximum security: a.

Aside from the obvious significance of the totality of these notes, what we see here is a master plan which has in it the key elements of the JFK assassination plot. A few comments: 1. A key element of the plan was “non-attributability” with maximum project security. Within the CIA only “one focal point” was recommended for control, search, training, case officering, etc. This indicates that there would be a project manager (the focal point) similar to the one I hypothesized in Chapter 8, The Mastermind. 2. A very revealing note is that “planning should include provisions for blaming the Soviets or Czechs in case of blow.” This strikes a ring of familiarity to the advanced disinformation plans for setting up Oswald so as to blame the Soviets or the Cubans; again, this is similar to my hypothesis. 3. Design of the plan includes provision for “a phony 201\" file to “backstop,” with all documents therein forged and backdated. The ramifications for this are, of course, huge. We must realize that any files we have looked at or any files we find in the future may very well be phony files with forged documents in them. Again, we see a parallel to Oswald’s phony 201 file. 4. Harvey’s notes recommended that agents be recruited from “Corsicans.” This would be French Corsicans. Note also that he rules out recruitment from Sicilians for fear that Sicilian agents would lead to the Mafia. This seems to have special significance because Harvey obviously is attempting to shield the Mafia from being discovered in their plots. 5. It is very significant that the recruitment of French Corsicans is what actually appears to have happened based on documents received from French intelligence, FBI documents, and other documents that will presently be discussed. Thus we have evidence of the French connection which"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"would later materialize in the form of French OAS members and French Corsican organized crime assassins. Again, this is similar to my hypothesis in Chapter 8, in which the “mastermind” spoke of bringing professional assassins of foreign origin into the conspiracy. 6. Harvey describes the characteristics of agents (assassins) that he desires. These requirements, if met, indicate that a very high standard of competence and a unique balance of ruthlessness and stable personality would be the makeup of the assassins. This was anticipated in my hypothesis. The significance of Harvey’s notes will be described in the material that follows Searching for the Identities of QJ/WIN and WI/ROGUE Exhibit 20-2, included here to help guide the reader through the maze, shows the relationship of ZR/RIFLE (William Harvey of the CIA) with QJ/WIN and WI/ROGUE.

It was first discovered by Mary Ferrell, veteran assassination researcher. I obtained a copy from the Assassination Archives. It reads: Jean Souetre’s Expulsion from U.S. Jean Souetre aka [also known as] Michel Roux aka Michel Mertz [or Michel Victor Mertz]—On March 5 [1964], the FBI advised that the French had [not clear] the Legal Attache in Paris and also the [not clear] had queried the Bureau in New York City concerning subject, stating that he had been expelled from the U.S. at Fort Worth or Dallas 48 hours after the assassination [of Kennedy]. He was in Fort Worth on morning of 22 November and in Dallas in the afternoon. The French believe that he was expelled to either Mexico or Canada . In January he received mail from a dentist named Alderson living at 5803 Birmingham, Houston, Texas. Subject [Souetre] is believed to be identical with a Captain who is a deserter from the French Army and an activist in the OAS. The French are concerned because of de Gaulle’s planned visit to Mexico. They would like to know the reason for his expulsion from the U.S. and his destination. Bureau files are negative and they are checking in Texas and with the INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service]. They would like a check of our files with indications of what may be passed to French. The FBI was given a copy of CSCI-3/776, 742 previously furnished the Bureau and CSD3-3/655,207 together with a photograph of Captain Souetre. [Blanked out] [257] (Emphasis added) Upon the FBI’s receipt of this information (received from the French; therefore, the FBI was not in a position to suppress it), the FBI contacted Dr. Lawrence M. Alderson, the dentist mentioned in the document. Dr. Alderson was practicing in Houston in 1964. He said that FBI agents began watching him in January 1964 and after about two months contacted him and said they were trying to find the Frenchman described in the CIA report. [258] Alderson said, “the FBI traced Souetre to Dallas a day before the assassination and then lost him...the FBI felt Souetre had either killed JFK or knew who had done it...they wanted to know who had him flown out of Dallas.” Alderson did not know who flew Souetre out of Dallas or why. Alderson said he had not seen the Frenchman since serving as a security officer with him shortly after World War II when he was working for the CIA at the time. Alderson gave the following information about Jean Souetre. [259] He’s a career soldier. From what I can gather, he was in the French underground movement in Algiers. I do know he left the French Air Force... I believe he is in the Fourth French Air Force Headquarters in France. He was a very prominent and upcoming French security officer. When I knew him, he was a lieutenant... I lived with him so I knew him quite well. He was very well educated, very outgoing, forward, dynamic. He came from a very poor family. In France, you don’t have a thing if you’re from a poor family unless you have a military career behind you. So, he was very interested in his career and this is why I never did really understand why he left it. But, he very definitely left, I presume, his wife. I have not heard from her in many years. She was a well-to-do, beautiful woman from a Southern France wine family. The last I heard from her, she was the one who told me that he had left the French Army and had gone underground trying to save Algeria. So, evidently, he was rather committed, or felt committed, to leave his career, which was the only career he had. The next time I heard of him, quite truthfully, was when the CIA, or the FBI rather, had me tailed for about two months following the assassination...The last contact I had with the CIA was in"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"France when I was working for him. So, the only contact I had in this country was with the FBI . [260] Alderson described Souetre as having been about twenty-five years old in the early 1950s and speaking English, Spanish, and German without an accent. He described him as about six-foot-one, weighing about 175 pounds, and a sharp dresser. He said that Souetre had a reputation of being a ladies’ man. He said that Souetre knew many French politicians and described him as a political activist of the radical right, neo-Nazi persuasion. And he became a military/political activist in Algeria, greatly agitated at the prospect of a Moslem Algeria, as opposed to a French Algeria. He was brutally opposed to “giving up” Algeria. According to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by Bernard Fensterwald, Jr., Souetre became head of the OAS in the South Zone of Algeria in June-July 1963. In August, a large number of OAS groups merged to form the “Armée Nationale Secrete,” which had representatives in Canada, New Orleans, and Latin America. Souetre, who was in Spain at that time, was alleged to have been deeply involved in the planning of the assassination of de Gaulle in August 1962. [261] In 1982, Souetre was director of (the Mafia) Casino at Dironne les Bains on the French side of the Swiss/France border. Souetre said that “he and Mertz had served together in two units in Algeria in 1958- 59, but had not seen each other after that time.” [262] He denied being in Dallas on November 22, 1963. He suggested that the person there may have been Mertz using Souetre’s name. According to an FBI report, [263] three persons named John Mertz, Irma Rio Mertz, and Sara Mertz flew from Houston to Mexico City on November 23, 1963 (obtained from records of Pan American Airways). The FBI report concluded: “These records contain no further identifying data regarding these individuals.” Thus we have evidence of a French soldier of fortune, who called himself Jean Souetre (a.k.a. Michel Mertz, a.k.a. Michel Roux), who was a member of a right-wing French militant group, being in Dallas on November 22, and then three persons, all with the name of Mertz, flying on November 23 from Houston to Mexico City. The exception here is that it was a John Mertz instead of a Michel Mertz. Or was this person in fact Souetre using Mertz as an alias? If this isn’t complicated enough, there was also a Michel Roux visiting the Dallas-Fort Worth area at the time of the assassination. The FBI ostensibly came up with his name when looking for Souetre and his aliases on behalf of the French. Michel Roux was a deserter from the French Army (as was Souetre) after three years of service. He was in the Algerian French Army, again like Souetre. In 1963 he was twenty- three years old, 5 feet 8 inches tall, weighed 148 to 150 pounds, and had black hair. He was born in France. The FBI reports that he spoke French, German, and English. The reason for Roux being in the Dallas-Fort Worth area on this unique date in history is somewhat curious. According to the FBI, Roux was a room clerk in a hotel in Paris where he met two American tourists who, for some strange reason, invited him to come to Fort Worth. He took them up on their invitation and arrived in New York City on November 19, 1963. He then took a bus to Houston and called his kind acquaintances (the names of whom have never been released by the FBI) and told them he was in the country and would like to see them. The incredible Texans drove over to Houston, picked him up, and took him back to Fort Worth; then they took him to a hotel, the Fox Manor, where he stayed during his visit. According to the FBI, on November 22 at the time of Kennedy’s murder, Roux was attending classes at Texas Christian University with his host. Roux and his host returned to the host’s home, leaving about noon from the University, and spent the rest of the day there. This would be Roux’s alibi if it could be confirmed through the mysterious friends in Fort Worth. But the FBI has refused to reveal their names. Roux left Fort Worth by bus on November 23 and returned to Houston. On either November 23 or 24,"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"he left Houston for Mexico City. He stayed in Mexico City for a short period while obtaining a visa and then returned to France from Laredo, Texas, on December 6, 1963. In 1982, Roux had moved to the United States where he lived in an expensive high-rise apartment on the east side of New York City. At the time, he had no visible means of support, no auto, no driver’s license, and rarely left his apartment. [264] How Roux, the lowly room clerk, financed and arranged his trip to Texas and Mexico, and became wealthy enough to return in luxury in 1982, remains a mystery. Michel Victor Mertz was born in France circa 1920. He would have been about forty-three years old at the time of the Kennedy assassination. Mertz (like Souetre) spoke almost perfect English, German, and Spanish, as well as French. He was part of the French underground resistance movement when Germany occupied France during World War II. His exploits have been recorded in a number of books and magazine articles. In 1946, he was taken into the French Army as a captain and shortly thereafter he was transferred to SDECE, France’s equivalent of the CIA. Mertz married Paula Scheller Martel, the adopted daughter of Charles Martel, operator of the famous bordello in Paris by the name of The Sphinx. This was Mertz’s introduction into the underworld of France and Canada. Mertz became actively engaged in both espionage and the smuggling of narcotics on a large scale from France to both the United States and Canada. By 1960, Mertz was one of a number of Frenchmen who had both French spy agency and narcotics connections. (Here we see the parallel between France and the U.S. where our CIA became involved in drug-smuggling operations and projects with organized crime.) In 1961, Mertz was ordered back to France by the SDECE to infiltrate the OAS. He was sent to Algeria as a reserve captain and pretended to be an OAS sympathizer. His mission was a success. He learned of plots to assassinate Charles de Gaulle and is credited with having saved de Gaulle’s life. Mertz then returned to the narcotics business and reestablished his contacts in Montreal and New York. Between 1961 and 1969, Mertz and his colleagues were alleged to have moved two tons of heroin across the North Atlantic. He was closely associated with well-known French gangsters, including Christian David (presently to be discussed as a major character in this drama) and other French gangsters connected to the Guerini organization in Marseilles. Of special significance, Mertz was also closely connected with the Trafficante organization in Florida. Mertz was considered an “untouchable” in France because of his SDECE and Gaulleist connections. However, Mertz was arrested in 1969 for his drug- smuggling operations and in 1971 was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison. He served only a small portion of that term. His whereabouts in 1982 were unknown. It is not clear whether Mertz and Souetre were personally acquainted. In any event, Souetre used Mertz’s name as one of his aliases. [265] As noted above, one of Mertz’s contacts in both heroin smuggling and French intelligence was a man named Christian David. It was Christian David who would tell a remarkable story concerning the Kennedy assassination, perhaps revealing the identity of the assassins at Dealey Plaza. Christian David was arrested in Brazil in 1972 and charged with being a member of a smuggling ring that had imported more than one thousand pounds of heroin into the United States over a three-year period. After his arrest in Brazil, David was extradited to the United States and sentenced to twenty years in prison. He was nearing the end of his prison term in 1985 when he was interviewed by a California writer, Stephen J. Rivele, to whom he told his story; David was fifty-eight years old at the time of the first interview. Rivele had become interested in the CIA’s Executive Action program and had started his own investigation to attempt to determine the identity of QJ/WIN or WI/ROGUE. Rivele’s research plunged him deep into the history of the CIA’s collaboration with organized crime and drug traffickers. This led him to Christian David."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"Jean Souetre (in the white sweater), also known as Michel Mertz and Michel Roux, both actual people.

In an article in the Oakland Tribune, Rivele described David as a petty hoodlum, arrested over thirty times, until he was recruited as an assassin into a French secret service para-police group called SAC. The purpose of that group was to fight the right-wing terrorists (OAS) in Algeria. A former French OAS officer claims that David’s victims ran to fifty-four. After Algeria was granted independence, Christian David returned to organized crime. It was during this time that he first worked for the CIA. David was a wealthy fashion plate and became a household name in France. [266] When Rivele first interviewed David, David was awaiting extradition to France to stand trial for murdering a policeman in connection with the murder of Mohammed Ben Barka, the Moroccan politician. David told Rivele that he had information on the Kennedy assassination, in return for which he wanted a deal with the U.S. government that would block his extradition to France. He said he would tell all he knew to a grand jury. Rivele found a Washington, D.C., attorney, Jim Lesar, for David and, through Lesar’s efforts, a federal judge temporarily halted David’s extradition, ordering that he be taken off a plane bound for Paris and held in New York City. But when the federal government found out, it got the judge to lift his stay of extradition, and David was flown to Paris. [267] In prison there since 1985, he was interviewed repeatedly by Rivele, as well as by Lesar. Lesar provided me with copies from the Assassination Archives of Rivele’s correspondence with him in which Rivele transmitted his notes of his interviews with Christian David. David’s story is this: In May or June of 1963 he was offered a contract by Antoine Guerini, the Corsican crime boss in Marseilles, to accept a contract to kill “a highly placed American politician” whom Guerini called the “biggest vegetable”—i.e., President Kennedy. The president was to be killed on U.S. territory. David told Rivele that he turned down the contract because it was too dangerous. Antoine Guerini was a Corsican resistance hero during World War II. He was a former triggerman for Mafiosi Carbone and Spirito, and worked as an agent for Anglo-American intelligence. [268] When English intelligence officers were parachuted into the Marseilles area they were hidden in the cellars of Guerini’s night clubs. Guerini also assisted intelligence efforts in smuggling arms. His younger brother Barthelmy was later awarded the Legion of Honor for his wartime exploits. The Guerini brothers would dominate post-war heroin production in Marseilles, but their downfall would arrive on June 23, 1967, when two assassins pumped eleven bullets into Antoine Guerini at a Marseilles gas station. [269] So here we have statements by Christian David, a Corsican professional assassin and soldier of fortune and drug smuggler, of having been offered a contract to kill President Kennedy by a Mafioso chieftain in Marseilles who had been part of the Faustian bargain between U.S. intelligence and the Mafia in World War II. After David turned down the contract offer, he said it was accepted by Lucien Sarti, another Corsican drug trafficker and killer, and two other members of the Marseilles mob whom he refused to name. [270] He described them as specialistes de tir -- “sharpshooters.” David said he learned what happened about two years after the assassination in a meeting in Buenos Aires during which Sarti, another drug trafficker named Michele Nicoli, David, and two others were present. During the meeting, the assassination of John F. Kennedy was discussed. This is how the assassination was carried out as David told it to Rivele. (I am including this without editing or condensing to permit a detailed analysis and to show the complexity and nuances.)"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"First Meeting of Rivele with Christian David, January 15, 1986 Met in private room with David for two hours. Gave him letter from Congressman Dellums asking for information, explained that we might make a deal with the House Intelligence Committee if David gave me specific, verifiable details about the assassination. David was very resistant. However, after prodding he did confirm that the Lucien he had referred to as having accepted the contract on JFK was Lucien Sarti, as we had thought. Said that about two weeks before the assassination, Sarti flew from France to Mexico City, from where he drove or was driven to the US border at Brownsville, Texas. Sarti crossed at Brownsville where he was picked up by someone from the Chicago mafia . [271] This person drove him to a private house in Dallas. Did not stay at hotel so as not to leave records. David believes that Sarti was traveling on an Italian passport, and that he spoke to his driver in Italian. David would say no more about the assassination. Did admit that he was working for the CIA in Congo in 1960-61, to kill Lumumba. Admits he discussed intelligence network with a man [272] in a hotel in Leopoldville but would not say who initiated conversation. Refuses to say who it was, though said he could say, but is terrified of CIA. Says CIA tried to kill him in South America in 1972, killed Sarti in Mexico. Said Dan Mitrione, killed by the Tupamaros, was in contact with him, had his name on a list and warned him several times to stay in line . Repeated that everyone who has expressed knowledge of the assassination has been killed, and he will be killed if he goes back to the US to testify. Said he would talk if released and in Mexico. (Emphasis added) [Note: See Epilogue at the end of this chapter for important corroboration of David’s story by the fact of his experience with Dan Mitrione!] Second Meeting of Rivele with David, January 16, 1986 Jim Lesar had given me four questions to ask David calculated to get a details of assassination. David refused to answer saying that they would implicate other people. Finally agreed to say how Sarti was paid. Said Sarti was paid in drugs. I asked what kind of drugs. Said Sarti was paid in heroin. Said to answer other questions would implicate other people. I began to have the impression that he meant he would implicate himself. Denied that his appearance had ever been changed surgically, though claims all photos of him are faked. Showed him Sarti’s photo and asked if it was genuine. Said Sarti was bald and always wore wig when photos taken. (CF: WI/ROGUE). David refused to say whether Sarti’s face were retouched. David refused to comment on this in any way. Gave me the impression that the photo was not authentic, or did not truly resemble Sarti. Got David’s fingerprints on cover of a book and on Sarti’s photo. Said CIA manipulated Oswald and him in the same way, and would be killed in same way if he is not careful. Third Meeting of Rivele with David, January 17, 1986 David’s lawyer had been to see him that morning to tell him that the government was going to try to have him committed. This terrified him. Agreed to give me certain information that might help to free him. Read him Jim’s latest questions. In reply he said: Sarti stayed in Mexico several weeks before going to US but not more than a month. Could not remember kind of car that fetched him at Brownsville. Asked him where Sarti fired from. David said Sarti fired from bridge. I asked what bridge. He corrected himself, saying not the bridge but that there was a little hill next to the bridge, there was a wooden fence on that hill, and Sarti fired from behind the wooden fence. This was said without any prompting of any kind. Said Sarti only fired once. I remarked that the president was shot from in front. He said he was shot from in front and behind. It was a crossfire. He said there was somebody in an office building but could not remember where it was. Said they cased Dealey Plaza, took photographs and worked out mathematically how to set up crossfire. Repeated that Sarti was"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"not in a building but on the little hill. Could not remember how much heroin Sarti was paid, that Sarti was not in drug trade at the time, but heroin was the liquid currency of the time. Said that Antoine Guerini was only the intermediary between Sarti and the Chicago mafia, that once he had put them in touch he withdrew from the affair. Sarti then made his own arrangements with the mafia. Would not say how they got to and from Dealey Plaza, or comment on photo of Frenchy. Said to my astonishment that Sarti was in the Congo at the same time he was. [273] I replied that surely Sarti was too young, only 23 or 24 at the time. He repeated that he was there at the same time. At the end of the conversation, in discussing Sarti, he mentioned that you can shoot better with one eye than with two; that when you have only one eye you are a better shot than someone with two eyes. Said there was no comparison since you’re not distracted by the sight in the other eye. This recalled the France Soir article which said that Sarti had lost the sight in his left eye in a car accident. Fourth Meeting of Rivele with David, January 18, 1986 Met with David for an hour. Said in response to my question that he thinks Antoine Guerini was involved in plots against Castro. Thought Paul Mondoloni was the intermediary, who spent much time in the US. Knew Otto Skorzeny as a Nazi, did not want to say how he knew him but said he never worked together with him. Said people who picked up Sarti in Brownsville were from the city of Chicago as opposed to Chicago area. Indicated that he knew Tommy Davis. Refused to comment on him. Said Sarti moved several times on his way from Mexico City to US and wasn’t in Mexico City very long. I returned to subject of a man with one eye. He said such a man shoots faster and more accurately than one with two eyes. Said he frequently went hunting with Sarti who always shot better than he. I showed him an aerial photo of Dealey Plaza and asked him to point out where Sarti shot from. He repeated that Sarti fired from the front, that he was not in a building. Said Sarti wanted to be on the bridge but it was guarded so he had to move down towards the hill. Asked me to show him the buildings. He then began talking about the gunfire. Reconstructed the shooting as follows: Three gunmen, very definite on this point. Said it was a crossfire with three guns. Two behind, one in front. Of the two behind, one was high and one was low. Repeated this several times. Said you can’t understand the wounds if you don’t realize that one gun was low, “almost on the horizontal” as he said several times. Said if not, the wounds would have been impossible. First shot fired from behind and hit Kennedy in the back. Second shot fired from behind and hit “the other person in the car.” Third shot fired from in front. Fourth shot fired from behind and missed “because the car was too far away.” Said that two shots were almost simultaneous. [274] Said the official investigation was faked. Said Kennedy was killed for revenge and money. Said CIA was incapable of killing Kennedy but did cover it up. Says he believes the gunmen went to Canada, that there were people in Canada who had the ability to fly them out of US. They had important contacts in Montreal. Refused to answer all other questions. Insisted that we must find Nicoli who was informed on plot. Refused to comment on whether Nicoli was involved in plot, but also refused to deny that he was. Said he first saw Sarti again two months after the assassination. Said few people knew that Sarti had shot the president. Insists that Sarti was assassinated, no reason for the Mexican police to kill Sarti. Believes the killing was deliberate and ordered by the CIA. Thinks that it was he, David, they wanted to kill in Mexico. Knows there was a contract on him at the same time. Said that Antoine Guerini was very careful about whom he hired for the affair. Refused to say who the other two gunmen were or to give me their nationalities. In speaking of Sarti, David said that Sarti was not a friend of his, that they worked together but he would not have chosen Sarti as a friend. Seemed quite bitter about Sarti. Said that Sarti had done something to him. When I asked what he replied that there were only two reasons why you killed someone, either to save yourself or to save a friend. But you only killed to save a"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"friend once or twice, but no more. Evidently he was forced to jeopardize himself several times to get Sarti out of jams. I said that Sarti killed for money. David said that was another matter which he would explain to me later. I repeated that Sarti had killed for money. He said, no, that’s something entirely different and he would explain it to me later on. Fifth Meeting of Rivele with David, January 25 Refused to answer any questions. Said could not reveal name of dead gunman because he still has family. Said he could prove identity of other man in Congo but refused. Said there were documents, statements made under torture which proved he was telling truth. Assume he was referring again to Sarti’s Argentine statement. Refused for the dozenth time to tell me his brother’s name or what hospital he is in. Told him Jim and Dan Alcorn were coming to see him. Urged him to cooperate with them. Asked if he could name others who knew about the assassination who had been killed to prevent them talking. Said I knew better than he who they were; people in the US. Asked for examples, he refused but repeated they were killed in US. Sixth Meeting of Rivele with David (no date given) Met with David in company of Jim and Dan Alcorn. Refused to answer questions, refused to give information before he was released. Very wary and uncooperative. Dan offered him a proposition. Could send message to high authorities in US. Message must prove his knowledge and willingness to cooperate. David asked to think about it. Said we should come back in two days. Said anything he said about assassination might be used to have him committed. French lawyers had evidently advised him not to cooperate with us. Seventh Meeting of Rivele with David (no date given) Met in morning with David. His Marseille lawyer had seen him the day previously and told him not to cooperate with us as he would soon be getting out of jail. David offered counterproposal to Dan’s. He will write down the essentials of what he knows about the assassination and give it to a Corsican lawyer of his acquaintance. Will give names, dates, means of entry and escape, etc. The lawyer will retain this information and contact Jim to confirm that it is what David promised. In return Jim and Dan will appeal on David’s behalf to the Court of the Hague. If they are instrumental in getting David out, they get the information. If David gets out otherwise, he will sell the information and give the money to his family. Said he will write down what he knows about the Congo separately and give it also the lawyer. Refused to answer any further questions. I met alone with David in early afternoon. Said he would soon be getting out, or if not would be put under psychiatric observation for a few months and then released. If neither, he said he would kill himself this year. One way or the other he was getting out this year. Said all three gunmen were Corsican. I mentioned that Sarti was born in Marseille, he said Sarti’s mother was Corsican, which made him a Corsican . [275] Said all three gunmen had living relatives who would revenge them if he told, and that they would trace the information back to him. Said only Sarti had an explosive bullet and only Sarti was paid in heroin. Would not explain the difference. Said find out who Sarti’s contacts in US were and I will know who was involved. Jim and Dan joined us late afternoon and firmed up details of the agreement. David promised to write the information down within two weeks. Said we should be hearing from the Corsican lawyer shortly after. Said he often travels to US. (Emphasis added) In his notes to the Christian David meetings, Rivele wrote: ...I believe that David is telling us the truth for the most part, though he is by no means telling us all that he knows. It is conceivable to me that he was not involved in the actual assassination, but the nature of what he has said suggests that he was. Frankly, I think it likely that he will not survive for"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"another year, unless he is freed. I accept the idea that Sarti was the man on the grassy knoll, and it strikes me as quite possible that Nicoli was another of the gunmen. The careers of the three men— David, Sarti and Nicoli—are parallel, their names almost always appear together, so that there seems to have been some sort of link among them.... Asked who could corroborate his story, David suggested that Rivele locate Michele Nicoli, who had been with the group in Buenos Aires in 1965 when the assassination was discussed. Rivele ultimately made contact with Nicoli after a lengthy search in North and South America. He was aided in the search by Michael Tobin, a high-level official in the Drug Enforcement Administration. Nicoli, who testified against French Connection members in 1972, was living under the Witness Protection Program, using a new name. The DEA official vouched for Nicoli’s truthfulness in the strongest terms, saying that he had proven himself to be one of the most reliable witnesses over the years that the DEA had experienced. Rivele’s contacts with Nicoli took place over many months, and he proved extremely reluctant to talk. In the end, however, he told both Rivele and Tobin essentially the same story as had David. Nicoli told Rivele that the Mafia in the U.S. had hired Sarti . Later, Nicoli was interviewed on a BBC television program and repeated his confirmation of David’s story. As far as could be ascertained, Nicoli and David had not been in touch with each other since the early seventies. By 1987, DEA official Tobin was satisfied that the matter should be pursued. And he formally notified his superiors that he wanted to conduct a grand jury investigation drawing on Nicoli’s statements. The DEA officials said the matter was outside their jurisdiction and turned the information over to the FBI. Nothing has been done to this date. Rivele became discouraged and gave up his investigation. After receiving death threats, he lived incognito in California until recent years. Lucien Sarti was killed by Mexican police in 1972. The identity of his two accomplices remains unknown. When I talked with Jim Lesar in Washington, D.C., in 1993, he said that Christian David was still alive and in prison. * * * We can now go to a connection between QJ/WIN and a young adventurer and thief by the name of Thomas Eli Davis III, who was from a respected family in Beaumont, Texas. He was connected with Jack Ruby in Cuban gun-running activities in the late 1950s, and was possibly one of the Oswald impersonators. [276] When Tom Howard, Ruby’s attorney, asked his client if there were any persons that the prosecution might produce who could be damaging to Ruby’s defense of momentary insanity, Ruby quickly came up with the name “Davis.” Ruby said that Davis had first approached him about using some of Ruby’s strippers in pornographic movies, but later the two had become involved in gunrunning activities. [277] Davis was in North Africa at the time of the Kennedy assassination. He allegedly was working on a deal to supply arms to the OAS. But he was jailed in Tangier in connection with the Kennedy assassination. According to correspondence between J. Edgar Hoover and the State Department, Moroccan security police arrested Davis because of a letter in his handwriting which referred in passing to Oswald and the Kennedy assassination. [278] And now we have an additional link in the French connection between the CIA and the assassination: Davis was freed from jail through the efforts of QJ/WIN, who worked for William Harvey of the CIA . [279] In early 1963, Davis had contact with anti-Castro Cubans as confirmed by his wife and family. Davis admitted to reporter George Carter that he used the name Oswald while in North Africa . [280] Davis"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"had roughly similar stature, age, and features as Oswald, leading researchers to believe that he may have posed as an imperfect impostor of Oswald in the months preceding the assassination. But Davis’s story was never told because it was not investigated by the Warren Commission or by the House Select Committee on Assassinations. In September 1973, Davis was electrocuted when he cut into a 7,000-volt power line while attempting to steal copper wire from a construction site. [281] Going back to Jean Souetre, there is important information that links him to right-wing extremists General Edwin Walker and General Charles Willoughby, [282] as well as to CIA officer E. Howard Hunt and anti-Castroites in New Orleans. The linkage to Generals Walker and Willoughby in turn connects to right-wing extremist H. L. Hunt in Dallas, and the John Birch Society, sponsors of the infamous black- border ads vilifying Kennedy. This information was in part revealed in the Fensterwald/Shaw FOIA lawsuit, [283] and was obtained from a former mentor of de Gaulle’s anti-OAS police by Gilbert Le Cavelier, a well-connected Frenchman who conducted an unofficial investigation for Bernard Fensterwald Jr. On this subject, Dick Russell wrote in his book The Man Who Knew Too Much : Le Cavelier found that Jean Souetre traveled widely in Latin America and the Caribbean between 1962 and 1971. Souetre’s official residence was Madrid, which under the Fascist dictatorship of Franco was a center for the international right wing—including, as we have seen, a site of occasional visits by General Charles Willoughby . “Extremely close ties have always existed between the anti-Castroites in Florida and the French extreme right,” Le Cavelier wrote Fensterwald in 1982, “through the intermediary of ex O.A.S. members who emigrated to Argentina, Paraguay and to Venezuela. In March-April 1963 Souetre met Howard Hunt in Madrid .” Hunt, as noted earlier, was then Tracy Barnes’s clandestine-affairs chief in the CIA’s Domestic Operations Division. Also at the meeting, Le Cavelier continued, were OAS Intelligence Director Jean Claude Perez and several Hungarians looking to expand the global anti-Communist network. Several of those present proceeded “in the direction of the Caribbean, then towards New Orleans. They rediscovered someone called Bringuier, director of the Free Cuba Committee.” Bringuier, of course, was the exile whom Oswald also encountered in the summer of 1963. Le Cavelier continued: “Then Souetre met—still around April-May 1963—with General Edwin A. Walker at Dallas. [Souetre was] at the training program of anti-Castro groups, Alpha 66 and the 30 November group” [the latter then led by Rolando Masferrer]. “Arms were furnished by the intermediary at the [American] Guantanomo naval base [in Cuba]. Training took place at the New Orleans region of Mandeville. Their Q-G (‘Quartier General’ or ‘Headquarters’) was 544 Camp Street.” That was Guy Banister’s office, and the address stamped on Oswald’s Fair Play for Cuba literature. [284] ( Emphasis added ) Summary of Key Points of Chapter 20 William Harvey’s conceptual notes for ZR/RIFLE are a blueprint for the JFK assassination plot, both in concept and detail: First, the employment of French Corsican assassins was planned by Harvey; and evidence shows that French Corsicans were in Dallas on November 22, 1963, and that they were"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"professional assassins. Second, Harvey proposed disinformation schemes to “blame on the Soviets,” and evidence shows that is exactly what happened to Oswald who was set up to be linked to the Soviets (and Cuba). Third, Harvey was very specific in recruiting only top professional assassins from outside the country. This appears to be what took place in the JFK assassination. Fourth, Harvey specified rigid controls to keep plots limited to a few participants with strict rules of conversation and no paper trail. (This is similar to the JFK assassination, insofar as the prime conspirators in government are concerned; there are virtually no paper trails and little if any record of conversations. The loose talk appeared to be by remotely connected underlings and two Mafia chieftains.) Finally, Harvey clearly specified the use of phony 201 files in CIA records, backdated and forged, to conceal the identity of participants. This was true for Oswald’s 201 file and for other assassination-related files kept secret for thirty years; when finally released they were empty or almost impossible to interpret with any specific conclusions. It proved impossible for me to sort out in the time available, with any certainty, the identities of QJ/WIN and WI/ROGUE. However, there is enough information available to form the basis of a major project in that regard which some future researcher could fruitfully undertake. In any event, there is no doubt that the CIA contracted with agents who had the cryptonyms WI/ROGUE and QJ/WIN and that these agents were professional assassins, and that they were either French Corsicans themselves or French or Europeans who recruited French Corsicans. This is of prime importance because Harvey clearly had a goal to recruit French Corsicans as his assassins in ZR/RIFLE. Christian David told Steve Rivele that he was approached by Antoine Guerini, Mafia chieftain in Marseilles, to perform a hit contract on John Kennedy. David said that he turned it down, but the contract was later accepted by Lucien Sarti and two unnamed accomplices. Sarti and his two accomplices were French Corsicans connected with the Mafia in Marseille. David was connected with the Mafia in Marseille. David’s statements were confirmed by Michelle Nicoli, who was considered to be a very reliable witness by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. Nicoli said that Lucien Sarti had met with him and Christian David in Buenos Aires, during which Sarti told how the assassination was carried out: Sarti was the gunman behind the picket fence; he was aided by two other Corsican assassins. The three assassins had met in Mexico City and crossed the U.S. Mexican border where they were met and handled by the Chicago Mafia. A further indication that Christian David was telling the truth is that he said that he met Lucien Sarti in the Belgian Congo in 1960. CIA documents confirm that both WI/ROGUE and QJ/WIN were in the Belgian Congo in 1960, in connection with the assassination of Patrice Lumumba. This links David in CIA assassination operations that were assisted by QJ/WIN under the direction of William Harvey. Antoine Guerini was CIA-connected from old OSS operations in World War II. He was also involved in heroin trafficking and had connections with the Drug Enforcement Agency that had worked closely with the CIA. QJ/WIN was recruited through the Drug Enforcement Agency by the CIA. Christian David stated that he was an associate of Michael Mertz in heroin trafficking. Both David and Mertz were connected to Antoine Guerini. QJ/WIN helped Thomas Eli Davis get out of jail shortly after the Kennedy assassination when he was arrested while using Oswald’s name in North Africa. Thomas Eli Davis was in New Orleans in the summer of 1963 while Oswald was there, and Davis had been involved with Jack Ruby in Dallas in gun- running activities related to Cuba. French intelligence documents and FBI documents show that a man calling himself Jean Souetre was in Dallas on November 22, 1963. Souetre was a French OAS terrorist and hated Kennedy because of Kennedy’s support of a free Algeria. Souetre used aliases of Michel Mertz and Michel Roux. FBI documents show that both Michel Mertz and Michel Roux were in Dallas on November 22, 1963. A French intelligence source states that Jean Souetre had connections to E. Howard Hunt, General Walker, and General Willoughby. Souetre met with General Walker in Dallas in April 1963. He also met"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"with E. Howard Hunt in Madrid in April 1963, and was at the training camp of anti-Castro operations near New Orleans, whose headquarters was at 544 Camp Street, in 1963. This was the address of Guy Banister’s office and the address on Oswald’s leaflets for the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. Oswald was involved in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in a COINTELPRO operation directed by the FBI. There is a linkage between all of these characters which encompasses operations in New Orleans, Dallas, the Caribbean, Cuban exiles, right-wing extremists, the CIA, French terrorists, Jack Ruby, Oswald, Guy Banister, and on in a complete circle. It seems unreasonable to conclude that all of this is just coincidence. What we probably are looking at here is a matrix of the execution and cover-up phases of the Kennedy assassination. In brief, the evidence in this chapter strongly suggests that the assassins at Dealey Plaza were originally identified and checked out by the CIA through the ZR/RIFLE project to assassinate foreign leaders of Third World countries, but once this capability was developed it was used to assassinate John F. Kennedy. This does not necessarily mean that the CIA (directed from headquarters) was behind the Kennedy assassination. But it does leave open the possibility that rogue elements, or ex-employees of the CIA, or an outside cabal of plotters, found it convenient, with Mafia cohorts, to hire the same killers they had come to know in ZR/RIFLE and use the same covert methods. This inquiry will be continued in later chapters. In particular, I will examine a further chain of evidence suggesting that William Harvey, Johnny Rosselli, and CIA operatives managed the execution phase of the assassination. I will also examine the possible roles of right-wing extremists in Dallas, New Orleans, and Europe. In the long run, the actual identity of the gunmen at Dealey Plaza may not be of great importance; they were hired guns. The most significant finding here is that there were four or five individuals in Dallas at the time of the assassination who were (in common) terrorists, murderers, drug smugglers; connected with organized crime, the CIA, and its assassination programs; and, moreover, connected to right-wing extremists in Dallas, New Orleans, and Miami. The evidence strongly indicates that a covert assassination capability developed by the United States could have been turned against the very core of our constitutional government. *** Epilogue The importance of Christian David having known Dan Mitrione— and having been warned by him that if he talked he would be killed—was pointed out to me by Gaeton Fonzi in Fort Lauderdale in October 1996 when he and I were there to interview Gerald Patrick Hemming. I had sent this chapter for Fonzi’s review months before, and he had finally noticed Christian David’s reference to Dan Mitrione. It struck Fonzi that this was very important inasmuch as it was corroborative of Christian David’s statements, by virtue of the fact that it placed David into a network including David Sanchez Morales, the CIA assassination specialist who worked for William Harvey. Morales was the CIA man in charge of slaughtering the Tuparamos in Uruguay for their murdering none other than Dan Mitrione! The fact that Dan Mitrione was warning Christian David that he would be killed if he talked lends even more credence to his story, and to the story of David Sanchez Morales, which will be reported in the chapter immediately following. Here we have strong linkages between Christian David, David Sanchez Morales, and the Guerini mob in France. This, we shall see, leads to William Harvey and Johnny Rosselli, and the assassination of President Kennedy. *** I watched the Academy Award ceremonies on television in March 1996, and to my surprise saw that Steve Rivele had received an Academy Award nomination for best screenplay for Oliver Stone’s film, Nixon. What a difference, I thought; Rivele had graduated from plodding around Europe, risking his life looking for QJ/WIN and WI/ROGUE, then going into hiding after receiving death threats, and now was a"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"celebrity."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"It takes an even greater leap into fantasy to believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was a lone nut. Yet, despite all the substantive and overwhelming evidence confirming Oswald’s association with the CIA, as well as his contacts with a number of Agency assets, the CIA still officially denies that it has any relationship at all with Oswald. Moreover, it fosters and deliberately maintains the issue as a matter of public debate. (Emphasis added) Gaeton Fonzi Former Investigator for the HSCA and the Church Committee 21 THE CUBAN OBSESSION In previous chapters we saw how the CIA’s program to assassinate foreign leaders may have been turned against our constitutional government, and how the personnel and capabilities developed for that program may have been utilized to carry out the assassination of John Kennedy. We saw evidence that CIA’s William Harvey planned the use of French Corsicans as assassins in his ZR/RIFLE program, and evidence that French Corsican assassins, recruited by the Mafia, were in Dallas on November 22, 1963. We also saw evidence that the Zapruder film was altered while it was in the hands of the FBI. We saw evidence that basic documents related to the crime were altered or suppressed by the Dallas police with the cooperation of the FBI, or vice versa. We saw that the FBI, in cooperation with the CIA and the White House, suppressed evidence of a conspiracy to set up Oswald in Mexico City. We saw evidence that Kennedy’s body was literally stolen from Air Force One and modified before it was delivered to the autopsy room at Bethesda Naval Hospital. We saw evidence that the autopsy and x-rays were altered to conceal the true nature of Kennedy’s wounds. We saw evidence that the brain examined after the autopsy was not Kennedy’s brain. It is clearly evident to me that a massive cover-up, directed by people in the U.S. government, was underway before Air Force One left Dallas on November 22, 1963, only two hours and seventeen minutes after the fatal shots, but it is not clear who masterminded the conspiracy; nor is it clear who organized it, planned it, and directed the intricate operations. In this chapter, and the chapters that follow, we will continue to struggle with these central questions. As I looked over the preceding chapters, I could see a web of evidence encompassing the CIA in Washington, D.C.; leading to Mafia and French OAS terrorist connections in Europe; leading from there to Miami and anti-Castro Cuban operations; then on to New Orleans where Guy Banister, Clay Shaw, and David Ferrie were involved with Oswald and anti-Castro Cuban operations; now moving on to Dallas; then to Mexico City involving the CIA, the Mafia, the Mexican DFS, and the FBI; back to Washington, D.C., to the very doorsteps of the White House and the headquarters of the FBI. Looking over this evidence of conspiracy, it appeared that a most fruitful area for further study might be the CIA’s anti- Castro operation in Miami and its relation with the Mafia. Perhaps by studying that milieu, additional keys to the puzzle would be found. The prime cast of characters in this chapter includes the CIA’s William Harvey, who, as earlier stated, loathed the Kennedys. It includes mobster Johnny Rosselli, who was closely involved in the same operations with Harvey. And a most important character to be studied will be a CIA assassination specialist by the name of David Sanchez Morales, who was David Atlee Phillips’ number-one “executive action” man in covert operations over the years. You may recall that David Atlee Phillips, also known as Maurice Bishop, was the man who met with Oswald in Dallas in September 1963 and who went to great extremes to conceal the truth of Oswald’s visit to Mexico City. In Chapter 8, The Mastermind , I speculated that there must have been a single person, a project manager, who planned the assassination. According to Gaeton Fonzi, and supported by CIA documents, staff members in the closing stages of the HSCA investigation in 1976 felt that person was William Harvey. In previous chapters we discussed Harvey’s involvement in the recruitment of French Corsicans,"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"possibly as hit men for the Kennedy assassination; and cross-connections between Harvey, Charles Siragusa, and the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, working together in the CIA’s mind-control program called MK/ULTRA. As I delved deeper into this story, Harvey loomed more and more as a central figure. It was obvious that more should be learned about William Harvey. William King Harvey I went to Washington, D.C., and searched the Assassination Archives, and had Anna Marie search the National Archives. I went through every book that I could find on the CIA and the JFK assassination, and was able to put together the following sketch of this outlandish and confounding man. William Harvey had a long and flamboyant career as a central figure in high-level CIA covert operations. It was Harvey who uncovered Guy Burgess and Donald McLean as British agents in Washington, D.C., working for the Soviet Union. Harvey also uncovered Kim Philby as the “third man” when Burgess and McLean defected to the Soviet Union. Harvey was responsible for masterminding the construction of a twenty-five-foot-deep tunnel between West Berlin and East Berlin, working in conjunction with British intelligence. This tunnel provided access to underground communication lines connecting Moscow with Berlin. Taps attached to those lines provided thousands of tapes. [285] Harvey had a brilliant photographic mind, an incredible memory for things in which he was involved. Harvey’s briefings would last for hours, all recited from memory of his files. Harvey projected absolute self-assurance. His capacity for planning and carrying out intricate master schemes of a covert, illegal nature was legendary. He knew every detail of his projects. Striking descriptions of Harvey’s physical appearance and character are prevalent in numerous books and articles: his consumption of alcohol (seven double martinis before dinner are reported); his extreme fascination with guns and knives (he was the only CIA officer who always packed a gun—in fact, two guns); his physical repulsiveness—bulging eyes from a thyroid condition; his gnarled brow and red face; his extreme obesity; his frog-like voice with chronic wheezing and grunting; and a waddling, swaggering walk. Harvey used weapons to intimidate his subordinates and peers. He would frequently place his two guns on his desk or point them at subordinates to make a point. Once, in a meeting with CIA photo analyst Dino Brugioni, Harvey held in his hand a foot-long stiletto. He cleaned his nails with the stiletto and then threw it at a target on his office wall. Harvey reveled in presenting himself as a swashbuckling, bold spy. He affected cop jargon. Allen Dulles once described Harvey as a conspirator or a cop, but he didn’t know which. Harvey took his orders from Special Group (augmented), which was chaired by General Maxwell Taylor and augmented by Robert Kennedy. The president’s brother treated Harvey with utter contempt; he browbeat Harvey and his aides relentlessly. Harvey was the antithesis of the sleek sophistication of the Ivy League types admired by the Kennedys. In one instance, Robert Kennedy demanded an explanation of an item, saying, “I’ve got two minutes to hear your answer.” Two minutes later, while Harvey was still talking, Kennedy got up and walked out of the room. Robert Kennedy took things into his own hands; he bypassed Harvey, dealing directly with CIA and anti-Castro operatives. Harvey began suggesting ominously that the attorney general’s habits were traitorous. Harvey grew to detest the Kennedy brothers, referring to them as “fags.” He would rail against them in drunken diatribes. He was dealt the ultimate humiliation by the Kennedys when, in January 1963 (after"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"Harvey, on his own, ordered commando raids on Cuba at the height of the Cuban missile crisis), he was removed from his post as head of Project Mongoose and sent to a much lesser post (chief of station) at the CIA station in Rome, Italy. Harvey was an utter disaster there. His drinking and repulsiveness got worse, shocking the Rome diplomatic corp. His relationship with his first wife, who was also an alcoholic, deteriorated. Harvey would fly into rages, kicking down doors, throwing glasses and card tables or anything else he could get his hands on. On one occasion he was found in a drunken stupor in a gutter in Rome. In short, William Harvey was a man of extremes—extreme indulgence of alcohol, extreme eating, extreme self-destructive behavior. Harvey was also a man who went into action and got results. He acted on his own without authority. He was a “hands-on” operator with bold imagination and cunning (he once worked with Mafioso Johnny Rosselli in personally delivering guns to anti-Castro Cubans for raids on Cuba). If ever there were someone in government who had the capability and destructive nature to plot the assassination of the president—and the pathological boldness to carry it out, without a major error— Harvey would seem to be that man. Before he died in 1976 of a heart attack, he instructed his wife to burn his papers and tell no secrets, to which instructions she has complied. It is easy for me to see that when Robert Kennedy insulted and humiliated Harvey, then sent him to Rome, ending Harvey’s career of action and power and breaking his self-confidence, Harvey may have felt his very survival was at stake. Like Lyndon Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover, Carlos Marcello, and Jimmy Hoffa, Harvey faced the end of everything he had wanted and worked for if John Kennedy continued in office. Of course, this alone does not mean that Harvey was the mastermind of the Kennedy assassination, but it shows his motives and state of mind. With his knowledge of covert assassination operations, and his relationships with the Mafia and professional terrorists in Europe (some of whom also hated Kennedy), Harvey could see to it that the assassination was planned, organized, and pursued to fulfillment. As reported earlier, while Harvey was presumed to be in Italy, [286] he surfaced at a meeting in Florida with Johnny Rosselli (Sam Giancana’s man and liaison with Santo Trafficante). At that time Rosselli was assigned to the CIA JM/WAVE project as “Colonel Rosselli.” Anthony Summers wrote in 1980: “Yet Harvey was still meeting with Rosselli, in the United States, as late as June 1963; and I have learned that he visited anti-Castro camps in Florida, at a time when he was theoretically already in Rome. According to new, unconfirmed information, initial approaches to hire assassins in Europe were made in Rome—sometime before the recruitment approaches were allegedly made to the Corsican Mafia in Marseilles.” [287] Summers updated this information in November 1991: “New research, reported here for the first time, indicates that the CIA Chief of Operations at its Miami and anti-Castro headquarters, David Sanchez Morales, was in direct contact with ‘Maurice Bishop,’ the cover name used by a CIA officer once seen with the President’s alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. According to Bradley Ayers, a former Army captain seconded to the CIA at the time, Morales personally controlled mobster Rosselli—and Rosselli was seen with him and another senior CIA officer, William Harvey, as late as summer 1963, after the agency had supposedly severed its connection with the Mafia. “Here the story comes full circle, back to New Orleans, the city where Oswald lived in the months prior to the assassination, and where District Attorney Garrison would one day stage his farcical trial. Johnny Rosselli reportedly came to New Orleans in 1963 to meet with Guy Banister, a former FBI agent and extreme right-winger then running anti-Castro operations out of an office at 544 Camp Street. The source of this information, Banister’s former secretary, told [Summers] ... that another visitor to the office was Oswald himself. The alleged assassin, she gathered, was involved in ‘undercover’ activity sanctioned by Banister. “For the first time, here is a direct chain of association. CIA officers controlling a top mafioso, who"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"meets in 1963 with an anti-Castro operative suspected of manipulating—perhaps of setting up—the young man who is supposed to have murdered the President of the United States. “It has always been clear that New Orleans held crucial evidence, evidence that could be the key to unlocking the mysteries of the Kennedy assassination. If the key in that lock is to be turned in the lifetime of this generation, more responsible work is urgently needed.” [288] I listed the key items that needed confirmation in Summers’ obviously important story: Item (1): Morales in direct contact with Maurice Bishop at the JM/WAVE station Item (2): Harvey seen at JM/WAVE with Morales and Rosselli in summer of 1963 Item (3) Rosselli in New Orleans in 1963 to meet Guy Banister at 544 Camp Street. The discussions that follow will address these items.

Gaeton Fonzi reported in his chronology: 10/08/63—David Phillips testified to the Assassination Committee that on this date he signed off on a cable from Mexico City to CIA headquarters reporting Oswald’s visit to the Soviet embassy on October 10. Later, records reveal that Phillips was on leave at the JM/WAVE station in Miami and didn’t return to the Mexico City station until October 9. [290] In Chapter 19, it was conclusively established that Maurice Bishop was a pseudonym for David Atlee Phillips. Inasmuch as Morales was chief of operations at JM/WAVE, and Phillips was a high-level CIA officer and had been involved in CIA assassinations operations over the years with Morales and was now assigned to JM/WAVE, it is self-evident that Morales would have been in direct contact with Maurice Bishop/Phillips at JM/WAVE. Item (2) in my list was dependent on the credibility of Summers’ prime source, Captain Bradley Ayers. Bob Dorff turned out to be the person who had done the investigative work and who had the ingenuity to put the story together. What follows is the story of Dorff’s investigation, along with additional new evidence. After Anthony Summers published his book Conspiracy in 1980, he received a telephone call from Bradley Ayers, who told him that he had been a U.S. army captain assigned to CIA operations in Florida in 1963 and had information that he would not talk about on the telephone, but would reveal if he could meet personally with Summers. But Summers, already busy on another book, did not follow up on the lead. It was not until early 1988 that Bradley Ayers’ story would be investigated by Dorff on the suggestion of Summers. Summers gave Dorff a list of “things to be done” on the JFK assassination, one of which was to contact Captain Bradley Earl Ayers. Summers did not have Ayers’ address or telephone number but did remember that he was a private investigator living somewhere in Minnesota. Dorff immediately started a search for Ayers. Within two months he found him through a Houston, Texas, private investigator, Joe West. Ayers was running a private-detective agency out of Woodbury, Minnesota. After some difficulty, Dorff found Ayers’ phone number and telephoned him. It turned out that Ayers was going to be in Los Angeles in about two weeks. He agreed to meet in Dorff’s office in Beverly Hills. Dorff had remembered a book entitled The War That Never Was by Bradley Ayers. Published in 1976, the book was Ayers’ account of his experience at the JM/WAVE station in Miami, Florida. Ayers used fictitious names for the people involved, with one exception: a “Colonel John Rosselli.” This would, of course, be Johnny Rosselli. A significant point in Ayers’ book was that he recounted a visit from Robert Kennedy to the Florida Keys to meet and boost the morale of the operatives of JM/WAVE. This is eyewitness evidence of the Kennedys’ continued direct support of efforts to topple Fidel Castro as late as the summer of 1963. [291] Dorff had learned from Gaeton Fonzi that, during the HSCA investigation, Fonzi had put a man by the name of David Morales on his “list of people to investigate”; Morales was thought to be involved in JM/WAVE operations and had been connected to David Atlee Phillips (see Exhibit 21-1). Fonzi did not know much about Morales except that he had been in the CIA dirty tricks department. Incredibly, neither Fonzi nor the other members of the HSCA staff knew that Morales was chief of operations of JM/WAVE —a very important position, indeed. He had been vaguely described to Fonzi as “husky, dark bronze skin, Latin-looking but maybe Mexican.” This caught Fonzi’s attention because Oswald had been reported in the company of dark-skinned Latin American men in New Orleans and Dallas. Dorff added Morales’s"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"name to a list of people he intended to ask Bradley Ayers about when they met. As Dorff ran down his list with Ayers, he came to David Morales. Ayers said, “Oh yes, the Big Indian—he was my boss at JM/WAVE. He was Chief of Operations.” Dorff told me he almost fell out of his chair when he heard this because he had learned from Fonzi about a big Indian (in Spanish, “El Indio”) who had been in David Atlee Phillips’ book The Nightwatch . Phillips wrote of an “El Indio” who was with him in all of his field operations throughout the years. (I soon learned that this included heavy-duty assassination operations such as murdering President Allende of Chile in 1973.) El Indio had also been involved with Phillips in the Guatemalan coup. The name “El Indio” had also come up in Jim Garrison’s investigation. Garrison had received an anonymous note from someone in Florida claiming that one of the men involved in the Kennedy assassination was named “Indio.” Dorff told me that now Bradley Ayers was telling him that a “Big Indian,” who was chief of operations at JM/WAVE, was Ayers’ boss. This clearly appeared to be a connection between Johnny Rosselli, David Atlee Phillips, and David Morales. And Morales was chief of operations of JM/WAVE working for William Harvey! Moreover, it seemed that Morales was the El Indio mentioned by the anonymous informant who had written to Jim Garrison! The HSCA had somehow missed all of this in its investigation, probably because it had run out of time when the investigation was prematurely shut down. I questioned Dorff about the believability of Bradley Ayers as a witness. He told me that in his discussion with Ayers over a period of several months he had come to believe Ayers’ story. His conviction was based on Ayers’ grasp of details of JM/WAVE in 1963 that appeared in Ayres’ book, in which he had written of Colonel Rosselli and the descriptions and pseudonyms of other characters. Ayers had used the name “Dave” when referring to “The Big Indian” and he had used the name Ted Morley in referring to Ted Shackley, who was Harvey’s chief at JM/WAVE. Dorff noted that this was written in 1973 before Ayers could have known the details or gotten the names from available documents or books. He was convinced that Ayers was telling the truth—enough so that he joined with Ayers in an investigation to track down more information about David Morales. Dorff provided Ayers with about $5,000 to partially cover out-of-pocket expenses for Ayers to take a trip to New Mexico, where it was thought Morales resided when he died of a heart attack. One notable point that came out of my discussions with Dorff is that he had learned from Ayers that Harvey was in the Florida Keys with Morales and Rosselli in the summer of 1963; Dorff had passed that information on to Anthony Summers, who then reported it in the 1991 paperback edition of Conspiracy . Dorff sent me copies of notes he had made during his interview with Ayers which confirmed Ayers’ statements. He also provided me with a copy of an affidavit, signed by Bradley Ayers and notarized, in which Ayers confirmed the real names of the characters in his book, as stated above. In 1978, Morales died of a heart attack at the age of fifty-three. This was shortly after Fonzi had put Morales’s name on the list of people to be investigated by the HSCA. Morales was one of several people who died suddenly when their name was put on congressional investigation lists in that period. But before I relate more of the story of the investigation of Morales, there is newly discovered documentary evidence that tends to corroborate Bradley Ayers’ statements. William Harvey in April, 1963 The U.S. Inspector General’s Report stated that William Harvey had met Rosselli in Miami and Los Angeles in February 1963 and again in Washington, D.C., in June 1963. Also, the report quoted Harvey as saying he had received a telephone call from Rosselli in April 1963. It seems significant that this"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"occurred after Harvey had been removed from anti-Castro operations in Florida and after he had informed the Mafia that they would no longer be involved in attempts to kill Castro. What could have been the purpose of this meeting and the telephone call with Rosselli? In early 1995, Anna Marie’s search of the National Archives uncovered Harvey’s telephone records and expense accounts for expenses while in the Florida Keys, dated April 1963, with this attention- grabbing header: Voucher—All Chargeable to OPS Expense QJ/WIN/ZR/RIFLE The QJ/WIN reference struck me as very important. Here, apparently, were expense records of QJ/WIN, with Harvey, in the heart of assassination training operations in Florida, which it has long been felt could have been the location for the training of the JFK assassination team! This was one of Jim Garrison’s first major allegations implicating the CIA. He alleged that an assassination team trained to assassinate Fidel Castro had been turned against President Kennedy. I had wanted to get together with Anna Marie to go over her research, so I took a plane to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where she had moved with her husband, who was transferred there by the Air Force from Washington, D.C. I went over the new material with her; it included a rich new lode on QJ/WIN, and Harvey’s tour of Europe when he interviewed potential assassins for the ZR/RIFLE stable. When I returned to San Diego, I examined Harvey’s expense accounts and telephone records and found— presumably for the first time—documentary evidence of Harvey being in the Florida Keys in April, 1963; moreover, there was evidence showing that he was involved in some complicated operations. Could it be that QJ/WIN himself was in the Florida Keys with Harvey when these expenses were incurred? The expense accounts were headed QJ/WIN, and Harvey had been instructed to handle QJ/WIN expenses through himself.

Between April 13 and April 21, 1963, Harvey was staying at a motel in Plantation Key, Florida, probably in room 22, and spent at least three days there. During this time, a boat was chartered to go to Islamorada, Florida (an island in the Florida Keys), and phone calls were made to Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Perrine (Florida), and Indianapolis. Also one round-trip plane flight, first class, Miami/Chicago was purchased. An expense account for this period was filled out, dated April 20, 1963. 2. During this period, there was reimbursement for dinner for three (two unofficial Americans and Harvey) at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami on April 20, 1963. In addition, there was reimbursement to ZR/RIFLE/MI for operational hotel rooms at the Eden Roc Hotel in Miami. 3. While Harvey was staying in room 22 at the motel in Plantation Key, someone else was staying next door in room 21 who listed his address as 56510 Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. The bill for room 21 was charged to Harvey in room 22. 4. The dinner at the Fontainebleau Hotel and the rooms at the Eden Roc Hotel struck a familiar note. These were favorite spots o f the mob. I remembered that Sam Giancana and Johnny Rosselli had met with William Harvey in the Fontainebleau Hotel in 1961 in what may have been their first meeting. Harvey had indeed been in the Florida Keys in Miami in April 1963 and he was bringing in outside unofficial visitors; and what he was doing had to do with QJ/WIN and ZR/RIFLE/MI. Inasmuch as QJ/WIN and ZR/RIFLE were exclusively equated to assassinations, it looked like an assassination operation. And the /MI indicated involvement of military intelligence. Bradley Ayers’ story was rapidly gaining credibility. If nothing else were to be concluded, the expense and effort had been worth it. I listed several intriguing questions: • Whose phone numbers were these? • What were the addresses connected to the phone numbers at the time? • Who was living at 56510 Wilshire Boulevard in April 1963? Was this a business, a hotel, or a residence? • Who were registered at the motel in Plantation Key, Florida? • What was the name of the motel in Plantation Key, Florida? • What was Harvey doing in these meetings—making these phone calls and arranging trips"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"when he was supposed to have been terminated from ZR/RIFLE and sent to Rome? • What other information could I glean by going through the assassination literature concerning the Eden Roc Hotel? • I noted that JFK’s trip to Dallas was officially announced on April 23, 1963. Could it be that this activity in Florida the week before the announcement was the finalization of the plot to be executed in Dallas? I reasoned that at some point, somewhere, the plotters would have needed to meet to finalize the details. Why not here? • Who would have been flying first class from Chicago to Miami? Likely someone for whom Harvey bought a plane ticket? Could it be Sam Giancana? Or a Hoffa operative? Why the boat charter? Was this for Harvey and possibly the unofficial Americans and QJ/WIN? I noted that Jean Souetre was reported as having met with anti-Castro Cubans and General Edwin Walker in April 1963, and that he also visited anti-Castro training camps in New Orleans during that same time period. Could one of the people who met with Harvey have been Souetre? Was QJ/WIN Souetre? I prepared a memorandum summarizing the above questions and mailed copies to Bob Dorff, Mary Ferrell, and Gaeton Fonzi to get their interpretations. Mary Ferrell had told me that the way to track down a telephone call made in 1963 is to call the public library in the city, ask for directory service, and then ask them to find the person whose name is listed for the telephone number in the crisscross directory. I passed this information to my niece, Lori Miller, whom I had enlisted to do research projects for me. Within about two weeks, Lori found that the Miami public library had telephone records dating back only to 1973, and that only one phone number turned up a name. It was a woman by the name of Elaine Briley, which probably had no significance. The remainder of the numbers on the list were no longer listed. Also, in Indianapolis, there was no such exchange as 231-2019 or anything close to it. (Mary Ferrell said that it might have been an unlisted number.) Meanwhile, Bob Dorff pointed out that Wilshire Boulevard addresses did not go as high as 56510. Lori encountered similar problems in the Los Angeles public library. The available telephone numbers went back only to 1975. I was disappointed, but consoled myself that this did not necessarily negate the importance of the documents. At least we had the cities that Harvey had called (Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Indianapolis, Miami, Perrine), all of which could have significance. It showed that Harvey was very busy during this four-day period and was certainly involved in some type of an operation that he was coordinating. Without these documents, I would have been dependent solely on the Inspector General’s Report, which had little detail. As a shot in the dark, I checked Jack Ruby’s telephone calls in the Warren Commission Report and discovered that Hoffa’s hit man, Barney Baker, called Jack Ruby in Dallas from the Eden Roc Hotel on November 8, 1963! Also, Dusty Miller (Hoffa’s chief of finance) exchanged calls with Ruby on August 2 and November 2, 1963. And on November 21, 1963, there was a telephone call from Barney Baker to David Yaras (Santo Trafficante’s cold-blooded killer and torture specialist). Things were getting more interesting. I wondered about the Los Angeles number CR3-0850. Could it have been a call to Johnny Rosselli from William Harvey? I remembered that Rosselli had been convicted in a card-cheating scandal at the Friars Club in the early 1970s. [292] The Friars Club was founded by George Jessell and was frequented by Hollywood comedians. It was (and still is) located on Little Santa Monica Boulevard in Beverly Hills. [293] Bob Dorff remembered that the Friars Club was in the Crestview (CR) exchange before they switched to all-digital dialing. As another shot in the dark, I called information and got the current number of the Friars Club. To my astonishment it is now 553-0850! The last five digits matched exactly those digits of the phone number in Harvey’s expense account; only the prefix CR was changed. It seemed extremely improbable that the last five digits would match in the Crestview exchange—there would be"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"only one CR30850. I then called the Friars Club and talked to a man named Clifford who was apparently the manager. He had no knowledge of what the telephone number for the Friars Club was in 1963 and indicated he could care less. When I pressed him to look in his files, he turned icy and terminated the conversation. Next I called Pacific Bell in Los Angeles and got a very cooperative operator who wanted to help me solve my problem. She checked with her supervisor who told her that they had 1963 numbers in microfiche but would not release them without a court order. But it certainly did appear that Harvey was telephoning Johnny Rosselli from the Florida Keys in April 1963, and Harvey was there in a ZR/RIFLE/MI meeting with QJ/WIN, whose only function was political assassinations. [ 2009 Update: A few years after the original publication of Bloody Treason , I received a letter from a person in Los Angeles stating that he had read this and did some research on the CR 3-0850 number and discovered that it was an unlisted number for the Friars Club in 1963.] Next, I checked a map and found that Perrine, Florida, is just south of Miami on the Atlantic coast. Islamorada appeared to be one of the principal towns in the Florida Keys. Located about halfway down in the Keys, it has a population of about 1500. This, of course, was the region where the CIA had training camps in 1963 for assassination squads. Plantation Key is only five miles from Islamorada on the west coast of the Keys. Then I received from Bob Dorff a rare copy of Bradley Ayers’ book, The War That Never Was . I assumed it would have information concerning the locations mentioned in Harvey’s expense accounts. I was not disappointed. Bradley Ayers had written of Islamorada, Plantation Key, and Perrine. In particular I noted that Ayers had written about two CIA safe-houses located on Plantation Key. The details in Ayers’ book were proving to be very accurate. They matched the information on Harvey’s expense account. [2009 Update: Years later I got a phone call from Bradley Ayers who was passing through San Diego, and I joined him for lunch at Denny’s near the Del Mar Race Track. He had read my book and thanked me for the story about him. He said it was completely accurate.] Then I received a letter from Gaeton Fonzi in response to my inquiry. He wrote: My guess is that Harvey was staying at the Plantation Yacht Harbor, a motel/marina on the Bay side which, I dimly recall, may have had some mob connections. (Hank Messick would know, but I haven’t been able to find his address, somewhere in Arizona.) It’s about a 40 minute drive south of the JM/WAVE station in South Dade County. Those Perrine calls, by the way, may have been to the JM/WAVE station itself, since the station was actually in Richmond Heights, right next to Perrine and the telephone billing may have carried the name.... What would be interesting, by the way, would be an FOIA request for the telephone directory for JM/WAVE (or Zenith or whatever other front names were used). Islamorada isn’t far down into the Keys but just below Plantation Key and likely the spot of an operational base on the Ocean side.... Another point in this geographical lecture is that the Eden Roc is just north of and in walking distance of the Fontainebleau. I summarized what this was leading to: 1. William Harvey and QJ/WIN (code for assassinations) were in the Florida Keys and probably working on some sort of assassination operation in April 1963. It seemed that they were involved in this with Johnny Rosselli and possibly David Morales. 2. The information seemed to confirm Bradley Ayers’ story. I questioned Bob Dorff about this, and he said that as far as he knew no one until now had ever produced documents that would confirm what Bradley Ayers had said—that Harvey was meeting in the Florida Keys with Morales and Johnny Rosselli in the summer of 1963. These expense records were for April 1963, which was close. Perhaps more expense records would turn up for the summer period. I asked Dorff if he thought Ayers may have been mistaken about the summer (could it have been in April?) and he said it was possible."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":" 3. The people with whom Harvey met in Florida in April 1963 were “unofficial Americans.” The Eden Roc Hotel and the Fontainebleau Hotel were Mafia hangouts. Sam Giancana, Santo Trafficante, and Johnny Rosselli had met in the Fontainebleau on occasions. Also, Harvey had once met there with Giancana and Trafficante. Moreover, Hoffa’s man, Dusty Miller, who lived in Chicago, called Jack Ruby in Dallas from the Eden Roc Hotel on November 8, 1963 in the midst of other phone calls between Jack Ruby and mafioso hit men, only two weeks before the assassination. 4. The pattern of Harvey’s phone calls to Las Vegas and to the Friars Club in Los Angeles, his meetings in mob hangouts in Florida, and his receiving a visitor from Chicago, suggested Mafia. It suggested that Harvey was coordinating a very important project with mafiosi and QJ/WIN of the French Connection. 5. The report by the Frenchman, Le Cavalier (see Chapter 20), that Jean Souetre (of the radical right-wing OAS) was in New Orleans in anti-Castro training camps in April 1963, and then later met with General Walker in Dallas in that same period, loomed even larger as I contemplated the possibilities of this information. I pondered whether I should put the arcane detail about the telephone numbers in the book, and decided that I should. Perhaps, someday, someone who reads this might know the people identified with these phone numbers and cities. I also hoped that more information and clarity would emerge as my research progressed. I now turned my full attention to David Sanchez Morales. David Sanchez Morales: CIA Executive Action Man In June 1995, I had the opportunity to talk with an attorney in Phoenix, Arizona, by the name of Robert Walton, who knew David Morales well. Walton was Morales’s attorney in the 1970s and had been introduced to him by Ruben (Rocky) Carbajal, who was Morales’s life-time good friend. (Morales’s father had left home when Morales was a young child. He had practically been raised by the Carbajal family.) Walton told me that because of attorney-client constraints he had not talked with anyone about Morales until years after Morales had died, but felt compelled now to tell what he knew that might relate to the JFK assassination. He first told this story to Bradley Ayers (long after Ayers had written his book) and later to Gaeton Fonzi who reported it in his book in 1994. But before going into that story, a short biographical sketch of Morales will be useful as background. [294] David Morales was born in 1925 in Phoenix, Arizona. At the time of the Kennedy assassination, he was thirty-eight years old and was a seasoned veteran in CIA covert operations. By his own account (according to his close friends), he participated over the years in CIA assassination operations in South America, Vietnam, Bolivia, Chile, and other places. Morales graduated from Phoenix Union High School in 1944. His friends remember him as very gregarious and popular. He was president of his class and a star letterman in four sports. He was not afraid of a street fight. Ruben Carbajal remembers in high school when Morales single-handedly and coolly took on a small gang of street bullies who had harassed him, and dispatched all of them in quick succession. Carbajal told Dorff that when Morales graduated from high school, he weighed about 140 to 145 pounds and was 5 feet 11 inches tall. Later, when Carbajal saw Morales, after he had joined the Army and had come back from Mexico, he had gotten much larger, up to 250 pounds, which he later reduced to about 225 pounds. Carbajal said that Morales never appeared fat, just big and muscular like"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"“two-ton Tony.” When Morales graduated from high school, he volunteered to join the Navy but was turned down, after which he attended college at Arizona State, USC, and UCLA over the next two years. He then joined the army and was assigned to paratrooper training. Shortly thereafter (perhaps as early as 1946), he was assigned to the CIA, underwent special training, and reported as a “political officer” for the State Department in Caracas, Venezuela. It was in Caracas that Morales worked with David Atlee Phillips; he also later worked with him out of the American embassy in Havana from 1958 to 1960. From there, after Castro took over, Morales moved with Phillips to Florida to become part of the Bay of Pigs invasion, then to operations with him at JM/WAVE in Miami, and subsequently to operations in Vietnam and Laos. While in Vietnam, Morales was part of the infamous Phoenix Program [295] in which perhaps 23,000 (estimates vary widely, up to 80,000) Vietnamese civilians were systematically assassinated in a CIA program to fight the North Vietnamese, “fire with fire,” hoping that they would kill a few Vietcong in the process. (The program was judged to be very unsuccessful because very few Vietcong military people were killed— almost overwhelmingly the people killed were innocent civilians.) Morales rose high in rank while assigned to the CIA—to brigadier general according to Carbajal, who said that Morales had an office in the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon before he retired. Carbajal told Dorff (and later told me) that he once visited Morales at the Pentagon. He said that Morales had a parking spot in the front row with the top brass with his name on it. (The very thought that one of the CIA’s top assassination experts would be a general with an office in the Joint Chiefs of Staff boggles the mind with its implications!) Morales died young of a sudden heart attack at age 53 in 1978. A long line of high-ranking military brass and well-dressed, important looking people in civilian clothes wearing sunglasses flew in from all over the country to attend his funeral services in Phoenix, much to the surprise of his old friends who had no idea he was such an important person. When Morales’s body was interred in the small town of Wilcox, Arizona, the line of mourners extended all the way through town, amazing the local citizens. Throughout his adult life, Morales was a very heavy drinker. Carbajal said that Morales was not an alcoholic but that he enjoyed polishing off a complete bottle of scotch. Morales had gained the reputation in the agency of having a loose tongue when drinking. This behavior may have contributed to his untimely demise. Morales had a cold-blooded, murderous streak in him. In Blond Ghost David Corn wrote that “Morales hated communists, and years later bragged to an Agency colleague how he had once in South America parachuted out of an airplane with men he suspected of being communists. Before they all leaped, the story went, Morales sabotaged the parachute packs of the Reds. He had the pleasure of waving good-bye to them, as they plummeted to death.” [296] Bradley Ayers wrote that Morales ran all the JM/WAVE station’s activities with a heavy hand and was famous for his violent temper. [297] He wrote that they soon learned that no one, save Ted Shackley himself, argued with Morales and that to cross him in any way was to invite trouble. Morales’s bad temper was confirmed by Carbajal (again confirming the accuracy of Bradley Ayers’ book), but Carbajal said that Morales did not display that temper much, except when doing a job. Carbajal said that then you had better look out if you didn’t do what Morales wanted. (In 1995 while I was at the Cuban Conference in Nassau I talked with Wayne Smith, who had known Morales at the U.S. embassy in Havana in 1959. He also knew David Atlee Phillips at the time Phillips was a CIA agent posing as a consultant in Havana. I asked Smith if Phillips had in fact worked with David Morales in Cuba in those years. Smith confirmed that he had. In passing, I mentioned that, based"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"only on having seen photographs of David Atlee Phillips and having read some of his testimonies, I had difficulty imagining that he could have been the type of person who would plot to kill the president of the United States. Smith agreed with me. He said that he had known Phillips in person and felt the same way. But then he said that David Morales was another matter. He said that he could well imagine Morales having been involved in the JFK plot; that Morales was a thug and a very rough character.) Morales was very selective regarding those close to him. He became close friends with Johnny Rosselli when they were together at JM/WAVE working on plots to assassinate Fidel Castro. [298] They would head off to favorite watering holes for drinking bouts. One perhaps significant bit of information was brought to my attention by Bob Dorff. He said that in his discussions with Bradley Ayers, Ayres had mentioned that Morales would frequently travel from the JM/WAVE station in Miami to Mexico City. This was confirmed by Ruben Carbajal. The significance is that David Atlee Phillips was stationed primarily in Mexico City, and Mexico City was the center for much intrigue in the JFK assassination. (Some researchers believe that Mexico City was the center of the planning of the JFK assassination.) My first conversation with Morales’s attorney, Robert Walton, was a telephone call on June 6, 1995. Walton recounted Morales’s astonishing words about political assassinations, and told of other strong indications of Morales’s personal involvement in the JFK assassination. Robert Walton is a Harvard Law School graduate. He practiced law for over thirty-four years in Phoenix, Arizona. Walton represented both Ruben Carbajal and David Sanchez Morales and was at one time in a commodities business with them. Walton’s relationship with Morales was first reported in Gaeton Fonzi’s book The Last Investigation. The purpose of my call was to confirm that material and learn what else I could. After a few introductory remarks, our conversation was as follows: Twyman: One of the reasons I called you was that I believe you’re one of the people who heard David Morales make that famous remark [referring to John Kennedy], “Well, we took care of that son of a bitch, didn’t we?” Walton: Only three people heard that remark: myself, my wife, and Ruben Carbajal. It took place in a hotel room at the Dupont Plaza [in Washington, D.C.], and we were the only three there. Twyman: That’s an amazing story. Have you ever written about it or documented it? Walton: I haven’t. In fact, I had all sorts of problems with that. It happened in 1973 and I had just had a coronary and I’d taken some time off. Ruben Carbajal’s parents pretty much raised David. David’s father had run off on his family and so he spent most of his time over at the Carbajal house as a kid. So we were back there with them [at the Dupont Plaza], Ruben and I, to meet David and discuss the two of us going into a commodities business; basically we were going to set up in Guadalajara while I took about a year off from the law to get my heart working right again. So we met him that night to discuss that. As a part of it he’d wanted to know who I was, right down to where I was baptized, so that he would feel safe about providing information to either Ruben or me, and know that he could trust me to the same extent that he trusted Ruben. We talked all night and there was a lot of scotch consumed. That’s when it did happen. Ruben and I tried the commodities thing. I went back [to Washington, D.C.] a couple of times, Ruben went back more often than that and through David met a lot of people including one that...his name slips me right now...he was later involved with supplying arms to Qaddafi and is now doing three life sentences. Twyman: Wilson? [299]"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":" Walton: Wilson. I met him once; Ruben met with him two or three times. But that was for about a one-year...we tried it for about one year, didn’t make any money. We chased a lot of rumors and most of them David would check out and tell us that they didn’t exist. And the two or three that did exist, for one reason or another we could never get them closed. So then I went back to law. After that David retained me for legal work on two or three occasions, so I felt I had an attorney/client obligation not to reveal anything that he told me. I did not until well after he died; he died in 1978. The first person that I ever revealed it to at all was Gaeton in about 1993. [300] Until then I did not.... I’d been asked about what I knew by a couple of people, I didn’t know who they were, where they were coming from and I didn’t feel it was appropriate to comment. That actually did happen. I can still picture where we were all sitting. He was lying down—just kind of stretched out on the bed. I’m a pacer, I’m usually standing. I was walking around and answering the questions. He just came off the bed when I mentioned that I’d done some volunteer work for Jack Kennedy in 1958. Gaeton’s book is incorrect in that respect, and I told Bob Dorff that. I said no need to correct it, but I did not introduce Jack Kennedy for a speech at Harvard. That was the mistake. What I did do was come up with the idea that this fellow who had just liberated his country and was going to be speaking at the United Nations ought to also speak to the American public; and I called around and got a hold of his entourage and scheduled him into Harvard stadium to make his first address to the American public. His name was Fidel Castro. Twyman: Oh! You got that arranged. Walton: I did mention that, and it brought him off the bed also. So I had two strikes against me when we started. And somehow, during the course of the evening, that was all overcome and we did end up being pretty close friends. I can remember the evening quite vividly. He was quite an interesting person, of course. I think it’s just mentioned in Gaeton’s book, the thing that amazed both me and Ruben time and again, that he would reach into his pocket and pull out a little black plastic card—it looked a little smaller than your typical credit card, just maybe slightly smaller. And it just had a few gold numbers or letters on it—no insignia or anything else. He’d show that and he could get whatever he wanted. He could get us on an airplane that was overbooked, he could get us in a restaurant.... Twyman: No kidding? Walton: It was amazing. Twyman: A magic card. Walton: We still don’t know. Yes. It was a magic card. And I still have yet to find anybody else that was in the company [the CIA] at that time that could tell me what it was and how come it worked so well for him. Twyman: Did you get more information from Morales related to the Kennedy assassination? Walton: One other time. I wished I’d pressed it and I didn’t. Someone had given me, way back in the ’60s, a Screencraft, West Yarmouth [Massachusetts] on Cape Cod, hand-decorated, John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy ceramic deal that you can hang on the wall. I remember that one time I had that somewhere in my office and he saw it and he offered to take it out and break it for me. Twyman: He did? Walton: And I said no, that’s not necessary, I’ll put it in the drawer. Twyman: He had a lot of anger toward Kennedy then?"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":" Walton: Yes. And we got to talking about Robert and I thought he was getting close to also talking about Martin Luther King but I didn’t press it, and it just drifted away. I always wondered in my mind whether he was about to tell me that he had an involvement there also, or not. That never came out. I don’t know, other than what he told me. He told me, you know, for his lifetime, he could just see in his mind, all the people that he knew just being butchered, and he was up there in the air and couldn’t do anything about it. Twyman: That’s on the Bay of Pigs? Walton: Yes. I think that was a haunting memory for him. I think there were other instances beyond that that he never conveyed to me. You’re right, it was a very deep, in a sense almost uncharacteristic, hatred. Because if I could think back, on most of the other people, he talked of them in kind of a detached form. All I can remember, and I think it’s the exact words, I remember him just saying, “We got that son of a bitch.” And he didn’t really identify who “we” was. He didn’t say “my company” or“my men...” Twyman: Just “we,” yes. There was a tremendous anger toward Kennedy about the Bay of Pigs. I was talking to another man who was there and had tremendous anger. I think the statement Morales made just by itself doesn’t mean much. You know, “We got that son of a bitch, didn’t we.” But if you put it in the context of everything else, in a total story, it has significance. Walton: I mentioned that I do recall that night. David telling us story after story about how he worked with the Bolivians to track down Che Guevara and that he was there when they made the arrest; and that he ordered them to chop his head off and then he kicked it as far as he could so there would be no stories that he’d been caught and captured but had escaped. He also told us stories that night about having his wife along when he did an assignment in Venezuela and killed the leader of Venezuela and that having his wife along almost compromised things and they almost got caught. He didn’t take her along on many things after that. He also told us that he killed a leader of the government in Chile. That same night he told us he had killed two ranking Vietnamese generals who were not cooperative, and the leader of Laos. He took first-hand credit for all of them. Twyman: He did? Walton: Yes. Twyman: Amazing. That would have been Allende in Chile.... Walton: We had an eight-hour gab-fest. I wished, you always do, I wished I’d had my tape recorder along. Twyman: Oh boy! Walton: The guy really just was wound up that night. I don’t know what it was, you know; booze was obviously a part of it. Twyman: Was this shortly before he died? Walton: No, this was back in my first meeting with him which was... I can tell you when, because I relate it to when I had the coronary in November of ’72...this was spring of ’73. [301] Twyman: Ten years after the Kennedy assassination. Walton: Yes. He didn’t die until about ’78. Twyman: Yes. He was 53, I think, when he died, by my records here. Walton: But I had represented him later on some legal matters including a DUI (driving under the"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"influence of alcohol) and that’s why I didn’t feel I could say anything, at least while he was alive. Twyman: Yes, well, a very interesting character. Walton: One of the last things he told me was—he invited me to go see his ranch—and he said, “I have the best security in the world.” And I said, “Well, David, what do you need that for, you’re thirty miles from the border.” He said, “I’m not worried about those fucking Mexicans.” He was part Mexican, part Yaki [Yakima], but he said, “I’m worried about my own. They all know me and they know I know too much.” And that was within six months of when he died. [302] Twyman: Of a heart attack. Walton: Supposedly. Twyman: Supposedly, right. Walton: I’d better run. Twyman: Okay. Let’s get in touch.... As I reviewed the foregoing conversation, I was struck by its historical importance. Here we have Morales’ own words, recounted by his attorney, [303] of Morales’s direct involvement in CIA political assassinations— not behind-the-scenes manipulations as reported by the Church Committee. We also have Morales’s perhaps unwitting confession of either his involvement, or the CIA’s involvement, in the JFK assassination. In a court of law this would surely be admissible evidence: It is confessional and state-of- mind testimony of the words of the deceased suspect himself from a most credible witness. I noted the parallel of Morales’s story to that of Jim Lance concerning the Bay of Pigs. Morales was in the air above the Bay of Pigs invasion helplessly watching his friends on the beach being slaughtered because, Morales thought, John Kennedy was a traitorous coward. At the same time, Jim Lance was watching the slaughter on the beach from a ship offshore. And John Kennedy and Robert McNamara were in the White House making a decision which history would never fully understand. I reflected that this is the material from which great tragedies are born. I also reflected about Morales’s father having deserted his family when Morales was very young. I wondered if that had anything to do with Morales’s rage and murderous nature. Why the violent extremes in his makeup? Could this be the basis for his motive if he were in fact involved in the Kennedy assassination—a rage against the father who abandoned him and his family—as had John Kennedy, the father of his country, who abandoned Morales and his fellow freedom fighters and comrades at the Bay of Pigs? Carbajal told Bob Dorff an amazing story in the January 1995 taped interview. Carbajal said that Morales told him this story after he returned from the assassination of Allende in Chile: Morales told Carbajal that he took $2 million from the $10 million that had been funded by the CIA for the Allende assassination; he said that Morales took it for himself. I saw this as very significant inasmuch as President Nixon had authorized $10 million to the CIA for expenses to get rid of Allende. [304] I mentioned this to Bob Dorff, who was surprised and told me that he had forgotten this evidence of the $10 million authorized by Nixon. Could it be that the $2 million that Morales appropriated came from that pot? I have often wondered if CIA agents would have been able to resist pocketing some of the cash that flowed through their hands in CIA covert operations, or in the drug-running partnerships with the Mafia in which they engaged over the years. Were CIA agents (or officers) a breed of moral purists who could be trusted with large sums of unaccountable cash to be used for bribes and heinous crimes without some of it sticking to their fingers? Of course they weren’t! And imagine the thoughts of the CIA agents: “This punk rich kid, Bobby Kennedy, thinks he is going to stop all of this good stuff!” In the latter part of Dorff’s"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"interview, Carbajal and his lady friend “Frankie” (who joined in the conversation late) reminisced about their good friend David Sanchez Morales, whom they both called “Didi.” Carbajal remembered that Didi had planned to write a book on his experiences and teach political science (gasp!) at Northern University in Flagstaff, Arizona; and, as Carbajal remembered, Morales had started to make such arrangements there shortly before he suddenly died. Carbajal said that when he needed to get in contact with Morales while still in the service in the late 1960s, he would call a number in San Francisco, use the code letters AID, and could then get a message to Morales. Carbajal made a point of saying that Morales was in special forces (Army) at that time. I noted that this could be significant: This connected Morales to the Army’s covert assassination operations through their special forces. I was particularly touched by a remark of Ruben Carbajal’s friend, Frankie, who thought highly of Morales. She knew him well as a close friend over a twenty-year period. She said, “He had a look of class. He was cleared to top secret. He spoke four languages. Whatever he did, he did for his country. He was a good soldier—a general—it was kill or be killed.” What can one say? Johnny Rosselli in New Orleans I found that Summers’ source for Item 3 of my list was buried in an endnote in the back of his book Conspiracy . He had learned of Rosselli’s presence at 544 Camp Street in an interview in 1978 with Guy Banister’s secretary, Delphine Roberts. Summers wrote: ...Rosselli has been identified as taking an active part in anti-Castro military operations in spring 1963. An exile training camp was being established in southern Louisiana at that time and with financing and support from organized crime. New Orleans would have been a natural enough place to find John Rosselli. Delphine Roberts says she believes he was there and actually visited 544 Camp Street.... [305] (Emphasis added) Rosselli was not the only California Mafioso connected with the JFK assassination milieu in New Orleans. Jim Braden, California Mafioso, also associated with right-wing elements in Los Angeles—the Minutemen. The reader will recall that Braden was picked up by the Dallas police on November 22, 1963, just after the assassination, when he was leaving the Dal-Tex building. Braden said that he had gone in the building to make a telephone call from a pay phone. He was released that day (see Chapter 15). The linkage of Braden to New Orleans goes back to 1963 when parole records show that Braden made several trips there. Respected Los Angeles reporter Peter Noyes wrote that Braden shared an office in New Orleans in room 1701 of the Pére Marquette Building, a few doors away from David Ferrie’s office on the same floor in room 1707 . [306] We know that David Ferrie worked for Carlos Marcello and has been conclusively linked with Clay Shaw and Oswald in their joint trips to Clinton, Louisiana. Also remember that Oswald had 544 Camp Street stamped on the leaflets that he was passing out in New Orleans, connecting him to Banister’s office. And, as previously noted, Oswald was also identified by Delphine Roberts, Banister’s secretary, as having been at Banister’s office on several occasions. Now add to this that Rosselli had two meetings with Jack Ruby in Miami in early October 1963, taking place in small motels, both observed by the FBI. This was reported by Charles Rappleye and Ed Becker in their book American Mafioso , based on FBI reports uncovered by a federal investigator thirteen years after Rosselli’s murder. This investigator relayed the contents of his investigations, on a"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"confidential basis, to Washington, D.C. reporter Scott Malone. Malone said he was confident of his source. [307] Here, and throughout this book, we have compounding linkages between Harvey, French Corsican assassins, French OAS terrorists, Rosselli, Phillips, Morales, Banister, Ferrie, Oswald, and Marcello— all occurring at times when the planning of the Kennedy assassination would likely have been taking place. There appears to be no end to links tying together this cast of suspects in the JFK assassination conspiracy: elements of the CIA, the Mafia, Cuban exiles, the New Orleans underground, and right-wing extremists in New Orleans and Dallas. Time and again, the evidence leads to this same menagerie of assorted political fanatics, deviates, and murderers—all operating plausibly under the protection and cover of Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover—and all fitting into the political and criminal matrix of the United States in 1963. Follow-up Interviews with Ruben Carbajal and Robert Walton I decided that I should take a trip to Phoenix, Arizona, and talk with Carbajal and Walton myself. The opportunity to meet and talk with these two men was too important to miss. Perhaps more information would be gained. Where else, in all of the Kennedy assassination evidence, do we have such a strong possibility of identifying a ringleader such as David Sanchez Morales? On the flight from San Diego to Phoenix on July 19, 1995, I had a sense of excitement. I had appointments to meet first with Ruben Carbajal at 2 p.m. that day in Phoenix at El Molino, his Mexican restaurant. I checked into the Doubletree Suites near the Phoenix airport and took a taxi to the El Molino. It was a 110° afternoon. The restaurant turned out to be a bar with Ruben’s memorabilia posted behind it, and a few tables. There were eight or ten patrons drinking at the bar or enjoying beer and Mexican food at the tables. Carbajal was there, sitting at one of the tables, talking with some friends. He was surprisingly spry and young-looking and greeted me with enthusiasm. We sat down at one of the tables, ordered beers, and started the interview. We talked for more than two hours with my tape recorder running in the noisy surroundings. I was concerned that it would turn out impossible to decipher. I was right. That evening at the Doubletree I listened to the tape and it was completely garbled. Fortunately I had arranged for breakfast the next morning with Ruben and knew I could at least capture the key points on tape then. Here is a transcript of the breakfast tape, with minimal editing for clarity: Twyman: Okay, let’s go back to key points. The first one was this $2 million. When Morales came back from.... Carbajal: From Chile. Twyman: Chile. Yes. He brought $2 million. Let’s see if I’ve got clear what he told you. He said that he found this along with $8 million more, $10 million total. Carbajal: No, he didn’t say he found this; he said there was $10 million involved and he said, “I’ll be damned if I’m not going to keep two of them.” Twyman: OK, he said there was $10 million involved . You know, I made that point to you yesterday about how Nixon had authorized $10 million. Carbajal: You see, I didn’t even know Nixon had authorized $10 million until you told me. Twyman: Exactly $10 million. It’s in the Senate Intelligence Committee documents. Then Morales used a small part of that to buy this land down in.... "},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"Carbajal: Well, I don’t know. He was making big money all the time, you know. Twyman: He wouldn’t have even had to use that money to purchase the land? Carbajal: It was easy on his wife. After he passed away, George took it to her for all I know. She went to China and every place, you know. She was a highly talented woman, you know, no dummy. She likes tours. Twyman: Oh, she took tours, too. Carbajal: Oh yes, she traveled to China and everyplace. Twyman: He accumulated this money while he was in the Army, or the CIA? Carbajal: I don’t know how much he had, but he wasn’t poor. Twyman: Yes. Okay, the second item was when Morales died suddenly. Did I have it clear that you suggested to his wife that she get an autopsy? Carbajal: Yes, I said, “Why don’t you just find out what the hell got him killed?” I never got an answer. As a matter of fact, I didn’t see her again until after the funeral. Over the next years she disappeared for a while, went back to Boston, I guess. I didn’t see her for quite a while. Twyman: And why didn’t she get the autopsy? Carbajal: She didn’t want anybody to get close to him. Twyman: She didn’t? Carbajal: Yes. She was even pissed off because I wanted to see him. Twyman: Well I thought that she had said to the effect that the CIA told her not to get an autopsy. Carbajal: Well, I think they might have told her that, but I wasn’t a witness to that; she was very rebellious about it. Twyman: She was. So it could have been her decision, on her own. Carbajal: No, no, I don’t think it was her decision. She’s not the type to maneuver around unless there’s some force behind it. You know what I mean? She’s strong; she’s not a weak woman. Twyman: So you don’t think she would have made a decision to not get an autopsy all on her own? Carbajal: No, I think they gave her orders not to do it. That’s my opinion. I mean I can read people pretty good, you know, and that, to me, was my opinion. Twyman: Yes. But you never did really discuss it with her? Carbajal: I told you, she disappeared. She wouldn’t even discuss it with Morales’s brother, Albert. I talked with Albert and he said, “I can’t get JoAnne to even open up to tell me anything.” Twyman: I understand she used to work for Morales in Germany, so she was part of the military establishment. Carbajal: Yes, she was his secretary. Twyman: Okay, then the next item here was in Uruguay. Could you just run through that again. Carbajal: Yes. You’d have to check back there for the dates exactly. But for about 3 1/2 or 4 years, the terrorists took over Uruguay, you know, for the government. So when they got all settled down thinking they were high on life, living free, nobody’s gonna touch them, they all moved into these complexes, you know, apartments, fancy apartments. That’s when the CIA, which is where Didi was the leader, took over and, like I said, they went from door to door, knocking on doors. For example, this one tenant lived here, they knocked on the door and wiped everybody out. They did that to every damned apartment. "},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"Twyman: What were the names of the people? Carbajal: The terrorists? Twyman: Yes, the terrorists. Carbajal: They have a special name. [308] I forget the name right now. And they wiped them out and gave the government back their country. All those things, nobody writes about them, nobody knows anything about them. We’re thinking that everything is handed down, like everything is copacetic, you know, here it is. Bullshit. They forgot who all the people were who worked to put it together, save other people’s asses, you know. Twyman: Yes. This is what Morales told you? He told you of this incident? [See Chapter 20, Epilogue , linking this to the French Connection.] Carbajal: Yes. Twyman: Okay. The next one is that we talked about Morales and his father. His father had abandoned the family.... Carbajal: Yes, when he was a kid, I never saw him. I don’t think Morales ever saw his father, either. Twyman: He never saw him? Carbajal: I don’t think so. It was like he didn’t exist, you know. Twyman: Just never mentioned his father. He never expressed any bitterness about that? Carbajal: Shit no. He didn’t even know him. Twyman: Okay, the next thing is the four languages that he spoke. Carbajal: Yes, he spoke four languages. He might have spoken more than that but I know of four that he spoke: Spanish, English, Portuguese, and German. I know he spoke those four real easy. He might have spoke more than that, but those I know he spoke. Twyman: He was stationed in Germany for a while. Was that after he was in the CIA? Carbajal: No, no, no. That was before. Twyman: Then the next thing is that famous statement, “We got that S.O.B., didn’t we?” I think we went over it. Carbajal: Yes. Bob Walton could tell you more about that, because he remembers it better than I do. Twyman: Yes, we went over it in detail last night. But let’s go over what your evaluation of that statement is; what it could mean. Carbajal: Like I said, it could mean different things. But you know, you wouldn’t make a statement like that unless you knew what was behind it or knew enough about it, you know, that you could put the finger on somebody, you know. That’s my way of thinking because how in the hell would you make a statement like that. “We took care of that son of a bitch.” He said “we.” That’s a whole organization, it’s plural, it’s more than one. Twyman: And that would mean CIA. Carbajal: God damn right that’s what it means. Twyman: Walton mentioned that Morales told him, he thinks it was on that same trip. Morales said to the effect, “Well, I was also in Los Angeles when Bobby Kennedy got his.” Carbajal: I don’t remember that part right now. Twyman: So Walton inferred that since he said he was also in L.A. when Bobby Kennedy got his,"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"that perhaps he was in Dallas when Jack Kennedy got his. Carbajal: I don’t remember that part. Twyman: Walton was clear that Morales didn’t say specifically that he was in Dallas. Carbajal: Because he could have been there. He was there many times. Two sisters, you know, lived there and one of his daughters. Twyman: Well, you know, there were 8 million people in Los Angeles at that time. I was in Los Angeles when Bobby Kennedy got his, so there may not be any significance to that. Carbajal: I was in Guadalajara then, in my home resting; the hell with them goddamn Kennedys and their bullshit. See, I had forgotten when the goddamn, what was his name? The one that got knocked off over there in Los Angeles? Robert Kennedy. When his brother made him the general attorney of the goddamn nation, he had never had one court trial. And then, I haven’t forgotten, when he said he told the blacks to take whatever you want, man, it’s yours. I haven’t forgotten those words. They pissed me off that day. Twyman: Well, Jack Kennedy put Bobby in unofficial charge of the CIA, too. Carbajal: He was an asshole. Twyman: He was 35 years old and had no experience in CIA operations. Carbajal: Stupid asshole. Twyman: Well, that covers the main key points. Let’s see how this plays back now. When you write these books you’ve got to make sure. It’s so easy to misinterpret what somebody says. Carbajal: When a person makes a statement...there’s a lot of ways... you’ve got a lot of leeway which way you want to go with it. It’s not hard to figure out with me. I’m not going to say positive, but it’s not hard to figure out. It’s not hard to figure out especially since I knew how he felt. I knew how he felt. Bob Walton probably told you the same thing; he was definitely just one way. He defended his nation against assholes. He didn’t like anybody to even talk against the United States. I never saw a man so dedicated to his country. Bullshit. He and I were like this. We used to get together all the time. We did everything together. We prepared a bunch of shit together, man. All three of us, Tony Sforza, myself and him, you know. Pisses me off. It makes no difference now. It’s too late now. But I’m preparing this other stuff down in Mexico now. Twyman: You going to go down there and retire, you think? Carbajal: No, no. When I retire it’s going to be six feet under. Twyman: I see. You going to stay here in Phoenix. Carbajal: That fucking retirement is for the birds, man. It makes you die in a hurry. Twyman: That’s what I found out. Carbajal: You’ve got to keep active; keep moving. Twyman: Yes. I played golf and tennis for about five years and just finally couldn’t take it any longer, so I got into writing this book. Carbajal: I believe someday I’ll go down there. I’ve got to check out this mine there you know, and then we’ll see and talk to my people there, the government officials there, get that squared away. I’ll be going back...going through there. Every time I’m down in Mexico about ten days I’ve got to come back over here. It takes me about another week putting things together, or maybe two weeks, and then we head that way again. Maybe I might wait till September when it’s a little cooler, you know. So they won’t be bitching so much."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":" Twyman: If you can, give me a call and stop by my place in San Diego. Carbajal: I will. The key points that I obtained from this interview are: 1) The Nixon/Allende $10 million item is very significant. Morales told Carbajal about $10 million when he came back from the Allende assassination in Chile; yet that information was not known publicly at that time, nor was it known by anyone except Nixon and the CIA. The Church Committee was formed years later. That is when the information became known, but then only to that committee. It is extremely unlikely that Carbajal would have known about it at the time of the interview in 1995. In my judgment, this makes Carbajal’s story about Morales very authentic. 2) Carbajal views David Morales as a great patriot and hero, defending a nation against its enemies. (Super-patriots are ideal recruits for the dirty work of assassination and terrorism.) 3) Carbajal is convinced that the CIA killed Morales, although he has no evidence to confirm that. 4) Carbajal is convinced that Morales was in fact talking about the JFK assassination when he said, “We got that son of a bitch, didn’t we?” But Carbajal seems only to take it to mean that “we” was the CIA, not necessarily Morales himself. 5) Morales’s involvement in the mass killings in Uruguay is something new to me. It goes beyond anything revealed in any government documents or the Church Committee Report, of which I am aware. Its linkage to the French Connection via CIA’s Dan Mitrione and Christian David is very important. 6) Although not covered in my taped interview with Carbajal, I had discussed with him the day before what he had previously told Bob Dorff: that Morales, in the latter part of his military career, was a brigadier general stationed in the Pentagon in the office of the joint chiefs of staff. Carbajal had visited Morales there. This links Morales to the very top of the military. 7) Morales telling Carbajal that he took $2,000,000 from the $10,000,000 confirms what I have long suspected: Many CIA operatives who were handling cash for CIA illegal operations must have skimmed some of it for themselves. This is a plausible motive for them joining with the Mafia to assassinate John Kennedy—to protect their own criminal operations and to keep the money coming their way ( not political ideology). * * * The evening before the breakfast interview with Ruben Carbajal, I had dinner with Robert Walton at the Doubletree during which I taped our conversation. I started taping after I asked him a question concerning Morales’s seeming cold-bloodedness in the assassinations in which he had been involved. Here are the results: Walton: He was just...he was very matter of fact. There wasn’t that much passion. He’d just say, “I’m the one that was working down in Asuncion [309] and I was monitoring where Che Guevara was and I had the Bolivian police arrest him. When I told them to shoot him, I said wait a minute and I asked them to chop his head off and I kicked it thirty yards, fifty yards, whatever, so there would be no stories about we only wounded him and he was still alive somewhere. I wanted to make sure that everybody knew that he was dead.” What he talked about most of the time was very clinical. It was almost like some of these Stallone movies. “I was the assassin and I just did my job.” About the only time he was ever human about it, he’d tell one story about assassinating the president of Venezuela, I think it was the"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"president, it was the leader anyhow. He said he made the mistake of having his wife along and he almost didn’t get them out because she created a real drag. There were no details, but he also talked about wiping out the head of Chile, the head of Laos, Vietnamese generals. It was like talking about a round of golf; “I had a good day at Pebble Beach but I didn’t shoot too well at Phoenix.” It was just very matter of fact, there was never any emotion to it. At the time I had never met anybody quite like that. I had to wonder if he was pulling my leg and kind of telling stories like a nineteenth century pirate might tell, you know, he’s got a peg leg and he’s sitting there telling the little kids what Robert Lewis Stevenson was going to make a mint writing about. Twyman: He was cold blooded...? Walton: He really sounded an awful lot like Hemingway. I mean, Hemingway’s short story The Killers , there wasn’t a lot of flowery description, there wasn’t any talk about hesitation or argument. It was just “I eliminated this problem and took care of that problem.” Twyman: Ruben told me about how Morales told him about going down in Uruguay and they would wipe out political dissidents that had taken over the government and restore another government and they would just go in and mow down everybody in their rooms with machine guns. Ruben told me that story today. It was in Uruguay. I don’t know the history on that but apparently there was a coup in Uruguay and then we didn’t like the government and so our CIA, according to Ruben, and just to replace the government there, went in and killed everybody. And Morales was in charge. Walton: He also spent a lot of time—I just wish I had a tape recorder and I didn’t—on details on the Bay of Pigs. I’ve flown over that about five or six times, and I still can’t picture everything, but he spent a lot of time explaining that was, I think, probably a turning point in his life. It was a very traumatic moment for him. After the Eisenhower administration, getting whatever they wanted without any hassle, somebody (JFK) said no. I think it was a real shock and it got a lot more emotion out of the guy on that than his description of what happened in South America which was really pretty clinical—except for the one story that he told me of his wife being along and he thought they’d bought the farm in Venezuela—but other than that most of his stories were really pretty much “law and order.” He was the law and he restored order and that was it. Twyman: I think that he looked at himself, maybe, as just a policeman doing his government’s will. You know there’s a gross misunderstanding about Kennedy’s role in the Bay of Pigs. It was a misperception of the men there like Morales; and I’ve talked to another man who was a frogman at the Bay of Pigs, down on the beach. Those people thought Kennedy had betrayed them when actually Kennedy had never promised the air cover in the first place. He had promised to let these dozen or so B-26 bombers do a job and they screwed up. They didn’t get all of Castro’s planes and then the Navy and the CIA came to Kennedy and McNamara and asked to use Navy strike planes off the carriers; in other words for the U.S. to intervene directly, and Kennedy turned it down. But Kennedy never promised that in the first place. Walton: I got the impression, and it may have been from Gaeton’s [Fonzi] book, I don’t know, that the appearance of a couple of old P-51 mustangs and a Catalina PBY were a total shock to the attack forces that he had organized. They didn’t realize that Castro even had these vintage World War II aircraft. Twyman: Well that’s more or less true. I mean, Castro really had a small air force, but they didn’t take out three fighter planes and those fighter planes really played havoc. If we had gotten those three, the disaster probably would have never happened. I was fortunate to get an"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"interview with Robert McNamara on this about a year ago. Walton: I want to buy his book; I haven’t yet. Twyman: Yes. I think I have it pretty well documented exactly what happened from the point of view of the men on the beach and men like Morales; and the point of view of McNamara and Kennedy in the White House. And you have a sort of drama where there are two different perceptions of what’s going on. The CIA was really the screw-up; it was a terrible plan. An absolutely stupid plan and Kennedy was stupid to even buy into it. But then, he caught himself in a position untenable in that he had made an issue of this in defeating Nixon in the election; he had made an issue of Castro that enough wasn’t being done and that we should be more overt and so forth. So the minute he got elected, he was presented with this plan, and politically he couldn’t turn it down, he would have been finished, politically. So he goes ahead with this stupid plan, and the Kennedys are young green, and the plan was misconceived by the CIA to begin with, and Kennedy changes the beachhead site at the last minute over to another site. It was a comedy of errors. But Kennedy and McNamara, when it finally came down to where they had to authorize escalation in order to win, beyond what they had approved, they wouldn’t do it. That’s the betrayal that Morales and people like him there on the beach saw of Kennedy. It’s not a black-and-white situation. It’s not that Kennedy was a coward, it’s just that he was smart enough to not let this thing escalate to where we would have had to invade. Walton: Concerning my conversation with Morales...I want to make this clear: Later on, I was David’s attorney but that was on a minor matter involving the State of Arizona and his driver’s license. When we had that conversation, I was Ruben’s partner. David was going to help. I was not operating under an attorney/client arrangement at all. Twyman: Okay, I can put a footnote to cover that. Walton: I don’t care, but just for the significance of it being totally accurate. So if anybody asks me later how come you revealed whatever David told you, at that time we were just business partners. I do remember one thing. David never asked for a penny of what Ruben and I accomplished. He was just trying to help Ruben out and if I was the arm that was along to carry.... Twyman: You mean in the business? David wasn’t in it for a profit? Walton: In the commodities deal. David was not a partner. He was just going to help us check the people out and keep us.... Twyman: Oh. He was just going to help his friend Ruben out. Walton: Yes. He was not a third partner in it at all. Twyman: Okay, that’s good to know. Walton: I had...it was kind of a testy evening...because I guess, in a sense, somewhat like the position I’ve taken in the last ten years because of all the heart problems I’ve had, I want to leave a mark. In my own mind I’ve decided that I may be better able to explain to people what freedom really is and how important it is not to be tampering with the freedoms that people 200 years ago sacrificed so much to create for us. This can kind of be my cause; a passion for freedom. This man [Morales] had that same feeling back in the early ’70s; he really felt that he was doing the right thing for this country, that there were all these bad guys out there. Not only the Castro’s but the Russians, the corrupt people within the turmoil in Vietnam and, in his own mind, he really thought that he was Zorro. That he was getting rid of the cancer within the organization and I don’t think he ever considered himself to be a hit"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"man. He was a surgeon. Twyman: He was a what? Walton: A surgeon. Twyman: A surgeon. I see. Walton: As in “we’ve got to get rid of all these people who are a cancer within the organization.” He was somewhat self-appointed. I got the impression that on a lot of these things he’d be hiding down the fifth level in some consulate in Asuncion or whatever. Making the phone calls at night, or whatever, to set up the Bolivian army being able to track down Che Guevara, and then he would just take a couple of days sick leave and be over there and actually witness the event.... Twyman: Then he kicked the head into the bushes afterward. Walton: Yes. But then, right back behind the desk. I’m trying to think of an example. Alfred Hitchcock had a great half-hour show back in the late ’50s, where I can still see his face, the British actor, but he’s taking a trip around the world. This young girl is all over him and she said, “Well you must be very successful.” What he’d done was steal money, do his five years in jail, and then when he got out he’d dug up the money. With the interest on the bond notes, he was able to take a trip around the world. David was a little bit the same way. His enjoyment was more at influencing the system in his own mind, seeing that right prevailed over wrong, which was communism or any kind of a government that was alien to our United States. I think he considered himself a super patriot. Twyman: The ultimate cold warrior. Do you have an opinion formed as to whether or not he did participate in the Kennedy assassination? Walton: I have no doubt. When he told me, “We got that son of a bitch,” he told me he was in Dallas. He said, “I was in Dallas and I was in L.A. when we got that Bobby too.” Twyman: Oh, he said he was in Dallas, too? Walton: No doubt in my mind he was there. I doubt very much that he personally pulled the trigger or anything else, but he was there, he helped organize it. Twyman: Well, that’s important that he mentioned he was in Dallas. He said he was in Dallas? Well, I’ll be damned. Walton: He said, “We got that son of a bitch and I was in Los Angeles also when we got Bobby.” Twyman: When “we” got Bobby? Walton: When we got Bobby. And when he said “also” I linked that back to Dallas. I’m not sure he ever said “I was in Dallas” but he did say “I was in Los Angeles when we got Bobby.” Twyman: I see. You can’t specifically remember he said he was in Dallas. Walton: No. Just the way he linked it on with “and I was also in L.A.” .... Twyman: Also in L.A. when we got...I see, by using the word also . Well, you know, you can see where a person that feels betrayed by the father of the country, and this was part of the thing I was developing psychologically, that Morales felt betrayed by his father who abandoned the family and then he admires Kennedy and gets betrayed by the father of his country. It could have been that a rage came over him there, psychologically. It’s pure speculation. I asked Ruben today, I said did Morales ever express any feelings about his father who abandoned the family? He said he never said a word about it. Walton: He never did to me. "},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"Twyman: Never did to you either? I think I’ll take that theory out of the book. I was just trying to think, how can a man get this murderous nature and how could any man who considers himself a patriot become involved to kill the president of the United States. Particularly a president like John Kennedy who was, I think, a darn good president. Walton: I had one client that reminded me a lot of what I thought David might be. I found out only because I was representing him in an accident case and I had to get his medical records from the military. I found out that he’s dead now and buried with full military honors, but he was discharged for the good of the service for challenging an officer who told him to climb up and get that flag unsnarled in lightning and bad weather and he said, “We’ll flip a coin to see which one of us goes up first.” That was insubordination and they put him in the brig. He came out and challenged the same officer a second time and they gave him a psychological dismissal for the good of the service. I wasn’t aware of that until we were trying to settle the medical case and I get his military records. About the same time he’s calling me and saying, “You haven’t got my case settled yet.” I was raising three kids by myself at this time, and he said, “It’s a shame you love your kids so much.” I said, “You son of a bitch. You come down tomorrow morning and get your file. I don’t want anything more to do with you.” He showed up with a cane and he started trying to beat me with the cane...he was hitting me with the cane. I had the police called, gave him his file and said get out of my life. He never did get out of my life. He had two or three more incidents that I reluctantly represented him in. I was the most relieved guy in the world to go to his funeral. Twyman: How do you relate Morales to this man? Walton: I think sort of the same thing. I think he had that same distrust of authority. He wanted to be a big shot but he also felt that the people who were giving him the orders were really no better than he was. Twyman: Again, this is speculative. I don’t know how you would have felt or how I would have felt if we’d have had fathers just run out and abandon the family. You might get a permanent distrust of authority. Walton: Well, hey, in those days we didn’t have the word dysfunctional, which we have now. But that would certainly be a dysfunction in a family. Twyman: Look at the O. J. Simpson thing where his father turned out to be a homosexual and abandoned the family or just left, I guess. Did Simpson’s father leave with another man or what? Walton: Yes. [Walton had just written and published a book on the O. J. Simpson trial.] Twyman: Just think. You and I would have had difficulty, I know, in even imagining what that might do to us if we had fathers like that. I mean, you had a good father, a strong father. I had a good father, a strong father. He had his faults and I had a lot of problems with him, but basically he was an honorable man who stuck with the family. Imagine what it would be like to have the father just bail out. I think it could make a permanent, deep scar psychologically in a person that even though they may never express it, ever, it may come out in various ways. Just like you say, a mistrust of authority. Walton: Quite possible. My time with David, even his adult life, isn’t one hundredth as much as the time that Ruben had with him. I probably had a period from 1973 to 1978, five or six years. I might have been with David a total of a dozen or fifteen times, whereas during that same period of time, Ruben probably saw him thirty or forty or fifty times. His visits with him were probably much longer in duration, also. I don’t want to paint the picture that we"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"were good friends. If he’d lived longer I think we would have been. Our relationship was pretty much...I was an adjunctive route. If it was something I was helping Ruben on, I’d be invited along also. David and I didn’t have a one-on-one friendship like he had with Ruben. In fact, it’s unfortunate, but in my adult life, I haven’t had but maybe one or two really good one-on-one relationships and both of them are dead now. Twyman: Yes, it’s hard to find a good friend. Walton: I kind of look back on my college years, my high school years, when you had so many friends. You realize as you get older that they’re only silver and the old ones are gold but there just isn’t that much silver out there. Twyman: Yes. You get disappointed, too, in friends. Did you hear a story on Morales—you probably haven’t—I read about it in another book. They were down in South America and there were these Communists and for some reason David and these Communists were going to parachute out of an airplane, they’re going to parachute out together. So David sabotages their parachutes and then they all jump out of the airplane, and as they’re all falling down, these guys pull their cord and nothing happens and David jeers at them on the way down and then pulls his parachute cord and is fine. Walton: I haven’t heard that. What little I know of David, that wouldn’t shock me. He had an amazing ability to rationalize that what he was doing was for the benefit of everybody. It was just that everybody didn’t understand it, didn’t appreciate it. Only when you get some alcohol in him... I don’t want to beat that horse dead, but that one night we were talking was over a lot of scotch and the two or three conversations I had with him over the next two or three years where he really opened up was because he’d been drinking a lot. He enjoyed being on the borderline of being baracho and being able to stay on his feet and stay in the conversation. Twyman: Was it a matter of pride with him to be able to consume a lot of booze? Walton: Yes. I think it was a big part of his life. It was for mine for some years in the ’60s when I was doing trial law. I pretty much backed off that by the time I remarried in ’69. David, I think, was pretty much that way until he died in ’78. He’d get started and he couldn’t stop. Twyman: Now, Ruben says he wasn’t an alcoholic, just a heavy drinker. Walton: There’s a difference, I think. There were times when I didn’t see him drink anything at all. But when he started drinking, quite often he wouldn’t stop. Twyman: Until he was drunk. Walton: I’d guess what you’d call a binge drinker. He did tell me that what he worried about was that he had the reputation on the part of some of the other people in his organization (CIA) that he drank so much that someday he was going to tell stuff that he shouldn’t be telling people. Twyman: You know, Fonzi quoted Wayne Smith, who worked with Morales in Havana in the State Department, that the CIA was getting very worried about Morales when he’d get drinking; he would get a very loose tongue.... you know, for him to come back here and tell you and Ruben what he told you about killing all these heads of state.... Walton: He told us that in Washington, not here. Twyman: It was all in Washington? Walton: Most of it was that first night in the Dupont Plaza, you know. Twyman: But when was he talking about Venezuela and Che Guevara?"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":" Walton: Most of that was the first night. Twyman: That was all part of that eight-hour conversation? Walton: I would say 90% of it. He came back a couple times and other stories would come out. I would say most of it.... Twyman: So was this sort of one major letdown he had? That throws a different light on this. I thought these stories maybe had materialized one at a time over a period of years. Walton: No. Once in a while there would be a reference back to... in my case, he talked about, I guess because he knew I had some interest in it, more about South America than Vietnam. I can only recall one time we talked about Vietnam. Twyman: The generals there. A couple generals were killed.... Walton: He claimed that he took out two. Twyman: Now, when he says he did this, did he mean his people did it or that he did it? Walton: You know, I don’t really know. You talk about “I told them to chop Che Guevara’s head off, I wanted to kick it so there would be no rumors that he was still alive,” I don’t know to what extent he participated in finding Che or whether he just was summoned after they had him tied up with his hands behind his back or whether he was just there at the final moment. I don’t know. Twyman: This picture of him being in Dallas, an absolutely incredible picture. But just in case I missed it on that other recording, is this what he told you? He didn’t really say he was in Dallas, but he said that when Bobby Kennedy got his he was also in L.A. So you could do a projection of that language back to get Dallas. Is that what you were saying? Walton: That’s the way I took it, yes. Twyman: You know, if Morales was in Dallas and if he was involved in all this, I mean, this brings the CIA into it all the way; not just a rogue warrior. Walton: He always talked about “we” did this, “we” did that. I never got the impression that, even on the Che Guevara thing, that it was anything he did. He was working Asuncion and spying from behind a desk and waiting until the Bolivians were given the information of how to pick him up and then he went and witnessed the final act. Twyman: Well, the role I have for him in the Kennedy assassination in my present theory is a field director of an assassination team in Dallas. In other words, he wouldn’t be the man behind the fence pulling the trigger, but he would have been the man in the boxcar somewhere or in the Aldophus Hotel or wherever it was of the various speculations where this coordination happened. He would be directing the team and he would be coordinating the various activities going on. Walton: I can’t recall his ever telling me “I pulled the trigger,” “I cut the man’s throat.” He was just there; he was a sidewalk superintendent. Twyman: Yes. I started my book thinking the CIA was the principle force behind killing Kennedy and I went away from that over the years. It almost developed to a firm belief that they were set up; that they really didn’t kill Kennedy. Maybe they had one or two rogue agents that got seduced by the Mafia or some right-wing extremists who put together this plot. If what it seems to be that Morales is saying in all these things he said, and if his position was as high as I believe it was, in fact, we know it was—he was chief of operations of the JM/WAVE station down there in Florida and he was a brigadier general in the Army a few years later.... "},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"Walton: (joking) He was a corporal. [310] Haven’t you seen his gravestone? Twyman: I haven’t seen that, no. Walton: I’ve seen the picture of it. I did not go to the funeral. Twyman: Ruben says he was a brigadier general at the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon. Did you witness that too? That Morales had a front-line parking space in front of the Pentagon and was a brigadier general at the Joint Chiefs of Staff? This is what Ruben says. Walton: See, I was only back there with Ruben I think a maximum of three times. Ruben was back there probably three times that many times. Twyman: So you don’t have personal knowledge that Morales was a brigadier general? Walton: I don’t. I do remember...I’ve been in his apartment over on the Arlington side, I couldn’t find it now but it was a high-rise apartment complex, well furnished. I do remember meeting Wilson who I guess is doing a couple of late terms right now. I do remember meeting some other people who at that time had names that I remember. Twyman: That’s the Iran Contra group, you know. Walton: I remember one night we had Mongolian food, another night we had Chinese food. He always picked up the tab with this same little mysterious card. I think my total meetings with David probably were three in Washington, D.C. Of course, the initial one took us down to Miami as a second part of the deal. Twyman: And he was just trying to help his friend Ruben out, then? Was that it? Walton: You know it never came up, but I assumed that if we made money we were gonna give him some, but we never did. My interview with Robert Walton provided me with considerable insight into the character of David Sanchez Morales—a portrait of a covert assassination expert. He was seen by both Walton and Carbajal as a super patriot (but in different perspectives), serving his country, and a friend. Perhaps that is the way most of the CIA felt: what they were doing was for the good of the country; they were soldiers doing their duty. Very frightening. There is no doubt in my mind that both Carbajal and Walton were completely open and honest in their statements concerning Morales; and that they both believe that he was deeply involved in the Kennedy assassination. Although all this evidence is not complete enough to warrant definitive conclusions, it is clear that, when combined with the ZR/RIFLE/QJWIN French connection evidence, nowhere else at this juncture do we see assembled such a cohesive body of documents and testimonies to explain the execution phase of the assassination. We also see in David Sanchez Morales what could well be the man who directly managed the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The totality of the evidence is compelling and believable. For purposes of analysis, I constructed a model (see next page), a triangle of forces, that appeared to represent the primary forces of the assassination, exclusive of possible high government officials such as Lyndon Johnson or J. Edgar Hoover, whom I assumed were background figures for cover-up purposes only, i.e., not involved directly in the plot, but nonetheless involved. The “right-wing extremists” would include the right wing of the Cuban exiles in Miami and right-wing extremists elsewhere. The value of this model is that it shows possible relationships of the parties without designating a hierarchy; and it facilitates testing against the evidence. If we accept the evidence that the professional assassins (shown in the center) were from the CIA- Mafia stable recruited for the ZR/RIFLE Project, then any of the three groups designated by the sides of"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"the triangle could have recruited the assassins, inasmuch as all three groups were aware of and had connections to them. Also, if William Harvey were the planning genius of the JFK assassination, he could have been involved only to the extent of providing a conceptual plan, then fading out of the picture. Using this model, I tentatively listed a minimum number of people who plausibly could have staffed the management of the JFK assassination: William Harvey: Planning Genius (the Mastermind) David Sanchez Morales: Field manager of the execution Johnny Rosselli: Mafia liaison to Harvey and Morales David Atlee Phillips: Disinformation and propaganda In this model, Oswald’s New Orleans phase could be an FBI and/or a CIA counterintelligence operation to discredit the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. Following are summaries of highlights of the evidence and reasoning that undergird these assumptions: William Harvey : His design concepts of ZR/RIFLE appear to have been applied directly to the JFK assassination plot. Flaunting authority, Harvey continued his relationship with Rosselli and met with him and Morales in the Florida Keys in the spring of 1963, at a time when Harvey supposedly was in Rome, and his involvement in Mafia-CIA operations to assassinate Fidel Castro had been ended, and at a time when the JFK assassination plot would likely have been in the process of being finalized. Telephone records and eyewitness accounts indicate that QJ/WIN was involved with Harvey in this operation in the Florida Keys. Harvey recruited French Corsicans as professional assassins with the help of QJ/WIN who worked for Harvey, and with the help of the Mafia in Marseilles. Harvey had the motive, the means, the opportunity, and the state of mind to become involved in the crime. Harvey loathed the Kennedys, having been humiliated and emotionally emasculated by Robert Kennedy. Documented evidence shows that French Corsicans were at Dealey Plaza on the day of the assassination and that professional terrorists from the extreme right-wing French OAS were in Dallas on that day. The French OAS terrorists were connected with the anti-Castro Cubans in Miami and New Orleans, and with extreme right-wing people in Dallas (H. L. Hunt, General Edwin Walker, and General Charles Willoughby, presently to be discussed), and visited New Orleans and Dallas in April 1963. These same terrorists were acquainted with the French Corsicans recruited by Harvey."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"Johnny Rosselli : He was the liaison and coordinator between the Mafia and the CIA. He was stationed at the JM/WAVE station with David Atlee Phillips in 1963, with the title “Colonel Rosselli.” Rosselli and Harvey were drinking buddies; and Rosselli and Morales were drinking buddies. Morales worked for Harvey; and Rosselli reported to Morales. Rosselli later displayed deep knowledge of the JFK assassination. He was the natural choice to be the Mafia liaison between the CIA (Harvey, Morales), and Marcello, Trafficante, Giancana; all of these four Mafiosi have revealed themselves to have been involved in the JFK assassination. David Sanchez Morales : He was a top CIA officer for assassinations, a long-time partner with David Atlee Phillips, and a natural to work with him and Harvey in an assassination plot against President Kennedy. By Morales’ own words, he implicated himself in the assassination. Morales hated John Kennedy for the Bay of Pigs. Morales had the cold-bloodedness, the experience, and the means to direct a field operation in Dallas—either remotely or on the spot. Jim Garrison had received an anonymous note from someone in Florida claiming that “Indio” (Morales’s nickname) was involved in the JFK assassination. By his own words, Morales participated in the assassination of Allende (or General Rene Schneider) in Chile and Che Guevara in Bolivia. Morales was a fervent anti-Communist, and would fit naturally with the extreme right wing. Morales telling Carbajal of the $10 million that had been provided by the U.S. to take care of Allende is very strong confirmation of his and Carbajal’s story because of its documentation in the Church Committee Report. David Atlee Phillips : At the very least, Phillips was a handler of Oswald, having met him in Dallas in late August 1963. Phillips went to extreme efforts to conceal the truth of Oswald’s visit to Mexico City. He lied to the U.S. government concerning evidence related to audio transcripts of Oswald’s conversation with the Cuban embassy in Mexico City. Phillips was a propaganda specialist and spent his life devising ways to mislead people and populations in sophisticated operations. Phillips is a most likely man to have conceptualized the Oswald “sheepdipping” operations in Dallas, and the phony story of Oswald’s visiting the Cuban and Soviet consulates in Mexico City. Phillips was directly involved with Morales in other assassination operations for the CIA. In conclusion, it is very plausible, although not proven beyond reasonable doubt, that the combination of Harvey, Phillips, and Morales, with help from the Mafia (through Rosselli), planned and directed the ultimate covert political operation—the assassination of the president of the United States. It is troublesome, however, why Phillips would have let the Mexico City blunder occur when he must have known about the elaborate photo and wire-tap surveillance at the Cuban and Russian Embassies. Was this one of his many blunders caused by the disorganization and mental lapses he was known to have on unexpected occasions? Or is there an explanation that has not yet been developed? *** Epilogue In high-ranking CIA officer John Scelso’s testimony released in October 1996 (reported in part in Chapter 19), one of the most startling of his statements was that he suspected that Harvey was the one who murdered Sam Giancana. He said, “...I wonder if the government has looked into the possibility that Harvey did knock off Giancana. He lived in the same area, when he was retired. He was a great one with guns. I read it in the newspaper. I was overseas and I said to myself, I wondered if they looked"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"into Bill Harvey.” When Scelso was asked if Harvey’s papers, which Harvey instructed his wife to burn, would have anything he was trying to conceal, Scelso sardonically replied, “He was too young to have assassinated McKinley and Lincoln. It could have been anything.” Scelso testified that Harvey “cracked up in Rome”—that he “became potentially paranoid, turned on his officers, threatened to have them ruined.” He said, “the whole thought of appointing Harvey, of using a former criminal for anything, let alone to assassinate people....here Helms cannot turn around, you see, after establishing standards...the conduct of operations....he cannot turn around and appoint a thug like Harvey to hire some criminal to commit assassinations.” Another document dated April 2, 1963 that I obtained from Gaeton Fonzi in November 1996 adds to the picture. According to Fonzi, based on the information and file number in it, this document clearly pertains to David Morales, although his name has been blacked out. It corroborates, to the letter, biographical information supplied about Morales by Bradley Ayers, Ruben Carbajal, and Robert Walton. The document also lauds Morales for “establishment of a covert training camp in a foreign country for operations in a third country.” Of importance is the following excerpt, almost certainly about Morales’s wife going with him on a Venezuelan operation as was recounted by Carbajal and Walton: Subject’s wife (C-162 296) was security approved on 16 September 1949, entered on duty in October 1949 and resigned due to pregnancy on 20 January 1952. She was again security cleared on 10 December 1952 but her file does not disclose whether she [not clear] on duty or is presently employed. No information of [not clear] as to nature of her employment is disclosed by the files. All of this again tends to corroborate the accuracy of the memory of Carbajal and Walton. Another very important finding, mentioned earlier, is the fact that Christian David, when in prison in France, told Steve Rivele that he had been warned several times by Dan Mitrione that he would be killed if he talked about his knowledge of the JFK assassination. Mitrione was a CIA officer who was murdered by the Tupamoros in Ecuador; Fonzi told me that this precipitated the slaughter of the Tupamoros in an operation led by David Sanchez Morales. This linkage of Christian David to Morales has a double significance: (1) it adds considerable credence to the truthfulness of Christian David; and (2) it links Morales to a network including Dan Mitrione and Christian David; thereby extending to the French connection, Lucien Sarti (the assassin behind the picket fence on the grassy knoll in Dealey Plaza, according to Christian David); then full circle back to the Mafia, QJ/WIN; then to Rosselli and Morales. Added to this is something that I recently came across in re-reading Seymour Hersh’s book The Price of Power , published in 1983. He wrote at length about the assassination of Allende and the $10,000,000 authorized by Nixon. Citing the Senate Intelligence Committee, Hersh included this interesting item: “By September 1973, when Allende was killed during a successful military coup, the CIA had spent $8,000,000, or at least had officially reported spending that much, on anti-Allende plotting” Subtracting $8,000,000 from $10,000,000 leaves $2,000,000! Was this the $2,000,000 that Morales took? Or is this just another coincidence? Hersh wrote that there were “...such large sums of money kept on hand in the CIA station in the American Embassy with no receipts given and no questions asked...The cash was too bulky to carry....” It seems beyond question that parts of the CIA had degenerated into little more than a pack of gangsters and assassins with personal greed running rampant, at least in some of their covert operations. And, once again, Carbajal’s account of Morales’ statements rings credible."},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"PART 4: RIGHT-WING EXTREMISTS AND POWER POLITICS"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"I was in a taxicab when I got the news. I had been in Dallas attending a meeting. I flew back to New York the next morning. It must have happened just as my plane was landing. My cab stopped for a light in Queens and a guy ran over and said, “Have you got a radio? The President’s been wounded.” I thought, “Oh, my God, it must have been one of the nuts.” A half hour later I got to my apartment and the doorman told me he was dead. I called J.

My reasoning was that their survival as individuals was not seriously threatened by John Kennedy; rather, it was the survival of key individuals, independent of their ideology that formed the motivation for the assassination. But as I progressed further and saw the large number of suspects who were right-wing extremists, I began to examine more seriously the possibility that the assassination was, in fact, a right-wing coup—conceived, financed, and executed by organized right- wing extremists. I noted, however, that such a right-wing conspiracy would not rule out the plotters having secured the cooperation of Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover or help from the Mafia and extremist elements of the military in carrying out and covering up their crime. I listed three areas to be examined: (1) Who were the right-wing extremists in 1963? (2) What evidence is there that implicates right-wing extremists? (3) Who are the key individuals who should be studied; who among them might lead to a better understanding of right-wing involvement? Who were the right-wing extremists in 1963? As far as I knew then, in my limited knowledge, they were fanatical anti-Communists and people who trained in paramilitary units on weekends. They seemed to have a natural rapport with the military and local police. They were considered to have a fascist mentality. They were flag-waving proponents of “free enterprise” and “law and order” who tended to be Christian white supremacists and were violently angry that their money was being taxed and distributed to the poor. As self-described Patriots, they distrusted and hated “big government” and, almost to a person, loathed John Kennedy. In fact, many had developed a paranoid hatred of him. They looked upon him as a liberal who was “soft on communism,” despite the fact that he was attempting to stop the Communist takeover of Southeast Asia, and despite the fact that he had faced down Khrushchev in the Berlin Blockade and in the Cuban missile crisis, taking the United States to the brink of nuclear war rather than yielding to Communists. This was not enough for the Patriots. They became very alarmed when Kennedy signed the nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet Union and when he gave indications that he was going to make peace with Cuba and enter into disarmament talks with the Soviet Union. Also, stories were circulating that Kennedy had begun to have second thoughts on our country’s involvement in Vietnam and was considering a phase-out by 1965, following the presidential election. But as I did my research in 1993, I discovered that my view of right-wing extremists in 1963 was nowhere near complete. The degree of dedication of the worldwide anti-Communist movement, and the fanaticism of the people in it, went far beyond my imagination. Adding to the explosive mixture were extreme developments within the U.S. military. Little did I know the extent to which our military had become engaged in political assassination, illegal opening of the mail of U.S. citizens, and any other means it considered necessary in its holy battle against communism. Not only the CIA, but army intelligence was employing these methods, thus creating a cadre of extremist generals, retired military officers, and murderers, who later could get out of control. Allied with the military in this fanatical war was a bewildering array of right-wing civilian organizations, with overlapping directorates including many of the most powerful and wealthy U.S."},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"citizens, some of whom developed their own paramilitary organizations. They embraced such Romanesque titles as the World Anti-Communist Congress for Freedom and Liberation, The Congress of Freedom, Inc., American Friends of the Anti-Bolshevik Nations, The Tolstoy Foundation, The Nightingales, The National Alliance of Solidarists, and so on. Folded into this mix were racist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan, The National States Rights Party, and the White Citizens Council. This is not to mention the John Birch Society and the Minutemen who were forming chapters (they called them “cells”) all over the United States and having heated discussions in homes to alert the citizenry to the menace of communism and socialism to the nation. [311] Who were these people? Were any of them involved in the Kennedy assassination? In fact, there were several key suspects in the plot to assassinate Kennedy who were right-wing extremists. First and foremost was J. Edgar Hoover, a right-wing extremist by definition. He was a maniacal anti-Communist and racist and promoted himself as a super cop, fighting evil. Hoover stood to have his whole sordid life exposed if Kennedy should live. Then we have Carlos Marcello, Mafia chieftain in New Orleans, who was direly threatened by the Kennedys. Marcello was a rabid anti- Communist and anti-Castro fanatic, along with his underling, the Communist-hater David Ferrie, who violently expressed hatred of John Kennedy and spoke openly in favor of his assassination. And, as noted earlier, Lee Harvey Oswald was connected with New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw who, in addition to being a CIA contract agent, was on the board of directors of Permindex Corporation, an extreme right- wing organization incorporated in Switzerland and operating in Italy. Add to this Guy Banister, ex-FBI agent, Louisiana head of the Minuteman, member of the John Birch Society, and drunkard, who was inclined to violence and who ran paramilitary groups out of his office at 544 Camp Street in New Orleans. E. Howard Hunt of the CIA was connected with this address, which was also used on the pro- Castro literature distributed by Oswald. Billionaire Texas oilman H. L. Hunt was a major contributor to extreme right-wing organizations, a friend and supporter of Lyndon Johnson, and closely associated with J. Edgar Hoover. The night before Ruby shot Oswald, Hunt ordered his security man to check out the security of Oswald in custody. His man went to the jail and reported back that there was no security at all. Ruby had visited the offices of H. L. Hunt the day before the assassination. Marina Oswald visited Hunt’s office with an FBI agent about a month after the assassination. Also, Hunt’s office was visited by Mafioso Jim Braden while he was in Dallas at the time of the assassination. Braden was picked up by the Dallas police after the assassination at Dealey Plaza, but was immediately released.

L. Hunt, CIA operative, and ex-Nazi spy, who was the first person to greet Lee and Marina when they returned to Fort Worth from Russia. It was de Mohrenschildt who introduced Lee and Marina to Ruth and Michael Paine, [312] the amazingly kind couple who took the Oswalds under their protective wing to help them adjust to their new life. It was Ruth Paine who got Oswald his job in the Texas School Book Depository, which just happened to overlook the motorcade route in Dealey Plaza. De Mohrenschildt would later unexpectedly commit suicide the day after HSCA investigator Gaeton Fonzi had contacted his daughter in trying to arrange an interview. It was Michael Paine who took Oswald to hear a speech by Major General Edwin Walker, the racist and right-wing fanatic, and organizer of radical fringe activities that prompted Robert Kennedy to have him temporarily confined to a mental institution. (General Walker had been removed from his post in Munich, Germany, because he had distributed right-wing propaganda to his troops.) It was General Walker who was allegedly shot at by Oswald months before November 22. The story that the shooter was Oswald was based on the most spurious evidence, but it created the illusion that Oswald was a crazed Communist sympathizer with the capacity to assassinate prominent right-wing figures. At the time of the assassination on November 22, General Walker was on a commercial airline flight to New Orleans when the pilot announced that Kennedy had been murdered. Walker ran up the aisle of the plane exclaiming, in effect, “See—it couldn’t have been me. I’m here on this plane!” The next day in New Orleans General Walker talked on the telephone with two newspapers in Germany to tell them it was Oswald who had attempted to kill him earlier that year. [313] There was no legitimate way Walker could have known this because Oswald was not yet a publicly identified suspect in the Walker shooting. That would only come later when Marina Oswald was interrogated by the FBI after a strange letter implicating Oswald in the Walker shooting showed up in her possession. And we should not forget General Walker’s connection with Jean Souetre, the French OAS right-wing extremist who visited him in Dallas in April 1963. More of our suspects were deeply involved in right-wing activities: oil billionaire H. L. Hunt, whose son, Nelson Bunker Hunt, also sponsored the infamous black-border ads vilifying Kennedy before his trip to Dallas and who organized his own paramilitary group; and anti-Castro Cuban Eladio del Valle, who was David Ferrie’s close associate. Del Valle was found bludgeoned and shot to death in Florida within a day or two of David Ferrie’s mysterious suicide in New Orleans, three days after the news media had revealed that Ferrie was a target of Jim Garrison’s investigation. I had to wonder who on our list of suspects was not a right-wing extremist! I went over a long list of my suspects or near suspects and found a virtually unbroken chain of individuals who were either right- wing extremists or closely allied with right-wing extremist causes. There were, however, a few exceptions. We can say with certainty that Lyndon Johnson was not a right-wing extremist. He was a purely political animal motivated by power and greed. Was Richard Nixon a right-wing extremist? It is difficult to put him in that category, although he was a fellow traveler with right-wing extremists and played off of their dementia for his own political advantages. He was certainly their choice for president. It is interesting to note that Richard Nixon became president only after Lyndon Johnson served one term and voluntarily withdrew from the race, and after Robert Kennedy was assassinated. It took two assassinations of Kennedys and the unexpected withdrawal of Lyndon Johnson from the race in 1968 before Nixon could become president, not to mention the attempted assassination of Governor George Wallace, who stood to siphon off Nixon’s southern right-wing vote. Could Lyndon Johnson’s withdrawal after one term have been an understanding between himself and a"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"cabal of right-wing extremists who were behind the assassination? Johnson had ample reason to agree to such an arrangement. He faced political oblivion if Kennedy were to stay in power; worse yet, he faced a possible sentence in the federal penitentiary if his involvement in the Bobby Baker and Billy Sol Estes crimes were not suppressed. But a question had always bothered me: If right-wing extremists were the organizers of the assassination, why would they kill Kennedy only to turn over the presidency to another democrat, Lyndon Johnson? A possible answer is that the extremists could have concluded they had no choice but to assassinate Kennedy before the 1964 election. Although they might have preferred Barry Goldwater or Nixon as president, from a practical standpoint it had to be Lyndon Johnson, at least for one more term. The reasoning would be this: If Kennedy stayed in power, he was going to dump Johnson before the 1964 election. The extremists knew this. They knew that when Kennedy picked his next vice president it could very well be someone out of their realm of control. The new vice president could turn out to be someone far more liberal than Lyndon Johnson; but, of more importance, only with Johnson as their man would the plotters be certain there would be a cover-up—absolutely indispensable for them to get away with the crime of the century. This reasoning would apply even if Johnson were not informed in advance of the impending assassination, because of the plotters’ knowledge of Johnson’s lifetime of corruption, and because they had blackmail material on him. Does the fact that virtually all of the suspects were right wingers, or shared their persuasions, mean that the Kennedy assassination was a right-wing plot? My answer is a guarded “no”; the reason being that the prime conspirators, despite including a few high-level, right-wing extremists, would not necessarily have plotted to kill John Kennedy out of ideology. Their motivation could well have been greed and power. In other words, it could be misleading to blame the Kennedy assassination on right-wing extremism just because many of that ideology were involved up and down the line. Also it would only be natural for the master plotters to recruit Kennedy haters and fanatics to do their dirty work; and, one would think, almost all of the violent Kennedy haters would have been in the extreme right wing. Nonetheless, to avoid a premature conclusion by ruling out a right-wing plot, I saw the necessity of examining the evidence for any proof of a conspiracy that was conceived purely out of right-wing ideology, even though I found myself rejecting the idea. I divided the possible suspects into these categories: 1) Right-wing extremists in the military-industrial complex: This would include industrialists, military chiefs, ex-military officers, the CIA, and military intelligence. 2) Individual right-wing extremists: This would include such people as H. L Hunt and his ilk. 3) Civilian right-wing extremist organizations: This would particularly include the Minutemen, the John Birch Society, and organizations such as the American Security Council and the World Anti-Communist League (WACL). 4) Ex-Nazis and war criminals: This would include German ex-spies, industrialists, and military personnel who became incorporated into our military industrial complex after World War II as a policy of the United States government. 5) Extremist elements in the Cuban exile community in Miami and elsewhere in the United States. [314] 6) White Russian and Eastern European immigrants to the U.S. who became part of the right- wing movement: This would include those elements in the Dallas-Fort Worth area who befriended Oswald and Marina when they came back from Russia.

It was a stage trick, complete with accessories and false mirrors, and when the curtain fell the actors, and even the scenery, disappeared. James Hepburn (pseudonym) Farewell America (A book reportedly written with the help of French intelligence) 23 THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX AND THE HIGH CABAL Evidence will now be examined that implicates extremist elements of the U.S. military in the Kennedy assassination. In addition, I will address allegations that the assassination was sponsored by, or at least condoned by, a segment of the industrial-financial elite of the United States. My goal continues to be to resolve the question of why John Kennedy was murdered and who were the principal plotters. Was it ideological or was it a matter of survival to those whom the Kennedys threatened? Was it the result of a power struggle between the Kennedys and the military-industrial complex? Was the assassination conceived and directed by super-powerful economic interests, or was it hatched by lower-level radicals and criminals? We know that when President Eisenhower was leaving office he warned of the powerful combination of weapons manufacturers, industrialists, financiers, and the military, which he called the military- industrial complex. There are many who believe that such an international combination of bankers and militant barons rule the world. Winston Churchill coined the term “high cabal” to describe such a powerful super-elite. A favorite villain for those who believe in the high cabal is the Trilateral Commission. In the 1960s and ’70s it was believed that the Trilateral Commission (consisting over the years of the Rockefellers and other such eastern-establishment types) determined even the selection of the president of the United States. For example, it was believed that Dwight Eisenhower and Jimmy Carter would not have been elected president had they not been approved by the Trilateral Commission after having agreed to do their bidding, which, it is claimed, was aimed at a liberal, one-world future. Many consider this to be nonsense. Others, to this day, believe it to be true. One of the more publicized of the high-cabal theories is in the book JFK by Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty. Oliver Stone’s movie JFK was based in part on Prouty’s work. Colonel Prouty has probably had more experience with the military and the national security establishment at a high level than any person alive today who is willing to write about the Kennedy assassination. During the Kennedy years he was chief of special operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He was portrayed as the “Colonel X” in Stone’s movie JFK . He worked with General Edward Lansdale, Robert McNamara, Allen Dulles, the Secret Service, and General Maxwell Taylor. He participated in many historic events from World War II on. In other words, he deserves to be listened to. What Prouty has to say is certainly interesting and could explain major aspects of the Kennedy assassination, although one may find fault with some of his reasoning. I first became acquainted with Prouty’s ideas in his book JFK. Later, I read his earlier book The Secret Team. Then in October 1995 I had the opportunity to meet with Prouty at his home in Alexandria, Virginia, for a fascinating discussion. What follows is a summary of the key points that I learned about Prouty’s views. In addition, I will include an equally fascinating discussion with Robert McNamara on the same subjects, as well as both Prouty’s and McNamara’s views on the Kennedy assassination. In his book JFK Prouty presents the appalling hypothesis that the Cold War was deliberately planned by a “power elite” to create markets for the arms industries. Drawing on his own experience, and in part on the works of Buckminster Fuller and Leonard C. Lewin, Prouty writes that the goals of the power elite"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"were conceived in beliefs that (a) preparation for war is the organizing principle of nationalistic governments; (b) the Malthusian theory of overpopulation threatens the future of the planet (this is extended to the Draconian notion that overpopulation will be forestalled, in part, by mass slaughter of people in planned wars); (c) the Darwinian principle that survival of the fittest (economic Darwinism) governs progress; and (d) a driving principle of nations is the control of real property; in other words, colonialism for exploitation of resources is a vital aim of nationalistic politics. [315] Prouty postulates that when the United States and England recruited Nazis before the end of World War II (with Allen Dulles as one of the recruiters), it was the conscious beginning of a plan to line up the capitalistic major powers against the inexorable forces of communism and socialism. In other words, the United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, Japan, and Nationalist China were to be allied as a block to oppose the anticipated expansionist thrust of the Soviet Union and the eastern block countries that were ceded to the Soviet Union through World War II agreements. The driving force behind this capitalistic plan was the powerful super-elite—the “high cabal” of bankers and industrialists. [316] Prouty states that the organizing principle of the United States after World War II was, indeed, promotion of war, with the ultimate aim of creating markets for armaments manufactured by the military- industrial complex. However, due to the advent of the atom bomb, and later the hydrogen bomb, all-out warfare had become obsolete and unthinkable because the power elite itself would be destroyed in the process. The “high cabal” thus saw the necessity for wars in lesser-developed countries such as Vietnam and Korea, where the conflict could be contained so as not to escalate to nuclear weapons. Prouty’s theory is that the Vietnam and Korean wars were consciously selected by the High Cabal at the end of World War II as the future battlegrounds for territory (real property) and for the consumption of weapons so as to provide markets for weapons manufacturers. He cites as evidence the fact that large stockpiles of weapons that were in Okinawa at the end of World War II, when Japan surrendered, were divided up and sent to Korea and Vietnam to foment militarism there and act as a buffer against communist China. [317] Because nuclear warfare was unthinkable, the need for covert wars and small, limited “conventional wars” became an indispensable part of the grand plan of the “power elite.” Thus we had the formation of the CIA as the agency of the United States government (and as the tool of U.S. business interests) that would conduct the Cold War through covert actions and methods of destabilization applied in the lesser- developed countries. The fact that millions of people would be slaughtered was, in the theory, an integral part of their plan. [318] Population growth must be controlled, so it goes. Prouty’s theory extends to the JFK assassination. He states his belief that John Kennedy began to disrupt this process and challenge the “power elite.” This became evident to the military in the Bay of Pigs invasion and in the Cuban missile crisis when Kennedy refused to accept the military chiefs’ recommendations for escalation. As a result of Kennedy’s disillusionment with the CIA and the military, according to Prouty, Kennedy awakened and: [319] - Decided to diminish the scope of the CIA by turning over covert activities that were in the CIA to the Department of Defense. He then replaced the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Lyman Lemnitzer, with his favorite, General Maxwell Taylor, in a normal rotation of that position. - Fired the top people in the CIA after the Bay of Pigs fiasco as part of his intention to take control. - Took direct charge of arms procurement—seizing it from the generals and admirals—and used it as a pork-barrel program for his re-election.

The objective was to get re-elected by a more comfortable margin than in 1960. According to Prouty, Goldberg and McNamara’s whiz kids radically changed the basic design of the TFX airplane over military objectives. Then they divided up the TFX contract in a master plan to influence votes from sections of the country that had previously leaned Republican. - Put plans in motion to make peace with the Soviet Union and reverse the Cold War process, thus confronting the arms industry with the probability of massive cutbacks. - Decided to pull out of Vietnam. He appointed General Maxwell Taylor in charge of a study group, and through their work issued a national security memorandum (NSAM 263) on October 11, 1963, to the effect that the U.S. was going to begin to pull out of Vietnam in 1964 and get out completely by 1965. Putting all of this together, Prouty essentially concluded that John Kennedy became engaged in a fight to the death with the military-industrial complex and the “power elite.” The fight ended with Kennedy’s death in Dallas. In his books, Prouty admits that he cannot say who those in the “power elite” are. He mentions the liberal Averell Harriman as one possible candidate for the power elite. [320] Prouty says this group is constantly shifting, people dying and being replaced by other powerful figures. He seems to think of the “power elite” as a cabal of powerful liberals and conservatives, but certainly joined together in the battle against communism and socialism. [321] Although Prouty’s idea of a high cabal manipulating the world sounded plausible, there was no real evidence, in my view, to support the allegation that the assassination of Kennedy was sponsored by such an ill-defined group. A more plausible explanation to me was that the acolytes of the “power elite” (in the form of right-wing elements of the CIA and threatened military leaders who were anti-Communist extremists) became aware of the desire of the Mafia and others to assassinate Kennedy and joined in the plan, perhaps even dominating it. In this version of my hypothesis, Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover were ordered to join the conspiratorial group, or joined it voluntarily. Their role was to orchestrate and control the cover-up. The “power elite” simply stood by and let it happen, looking the other way during the aftermath. It seemed extremely plausible that the “power elite” were not involved in the plan at all, or that only a very few of them even knew about it in advance, but that once it happened they recognized the need to cover it up for the “good of the nation.” If the truth had come out about the extreme nature of the conspiracy, quite conceivably it could have devastated the credibility of the military-industrial complex, and the results—from their point of view—would have been unpredictable, possibly an economic catastrophe, and therefore to be avoided at all costs. It was at this point in my investigation that I had a dialogue with Robert McNamara concerning the Kennedy assassination. A Conversation with Robert S. McNamara I first met Robert McNamara in a hiking group in California’s High Sierra mountains in the spring of 1994. Our group hiked and camped out for six days during a forty-mile trek starting at Mammoth Lakes,"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"across Donohue Pass at 11,500 feet to Touloumne Meadows. McNamara, then a vigorous seventy-eight years, led the pace. Throughout the hike, we discussed everything under the sun, or so it seemed, but I never mentioned the Kennedy assassination. A few months later, I contacted McNamara and asked him if we could meet for a discussion of the Kennedy assassination during my upcoming trip to Washington, D.C. After first saying he was not prepared to “go on the record” on that subject, he agreed, and suggested that we meet and talk over dinner at his home in Georgetown. The date was set for October 7, 1994 at 7:00 p.m. Needless to say, I was very pleased that someone of McNamara’s stature, who had been close to the Kennedy family and who had served as secretary of defense under both Kennedy and Johnson and as president of the World Bank, would grant me an interview. My purpose in seeking the interview, other than the obvious, was to get a first-hand account of the feelings and opinions of McNamara concerning Lyndon Johnson—as to whether or not McNamara felt that Johnson was capable of being involved in a plot to assassinate President Kennedy. I had begun to think of myself as being presumptuous in writing seriously about the unthinkable—that Lyndon Johnson was involved in the plot. Who was I to harbor such thoughts? I had never met the man except seeing him close-up at one speech he had given. And in discussions with a friend who knew Lyndon Johnson, I had been admonished that Johnson was not the type of man who would be involved in a plot to kill the president. I also wanted to learn from McNamara whether there was a war crisis atmosphere in the White House on the night of the assassination when Lyndon Johnson returned from Dallas. Two years previously I had interviewed Admiral Taswell Shepard, who was the first military officer to meet with Lyndon Johnson when Johnson arrived at the White House on the night of the assassination. I had asked Shepard that question. At the time of the assassination, Shepard was a captain in the Navy and was in charge of the “nuclear football”—the president’s black box that controlled the release of nuclear missiles. Shepard told me unequivocally that there was no such crisis that night. He said that he knew what such a crisis was like because he had been with John Kennedy during the Cuban missile crisis and there was nothing at all like that on the night of November 22. I had always felt that this knowledge would be important because there is no question that Lyndon Johnson had used the nuclear war scare in recruiting Earl Warren and others to serve on the Warren Commission. While in Washington, D.C., I took a taxi and arrived at McNamara’s home on the appointed date, ten minutes early. I was admitted by his butler. McNamara showed up a few minutes later in jogging shoes, returning from his office. He was in the midst of a final review of his 155,000-word manuscript In Retrospect, which would soon create a firestorm against him. We each had a scotch and soda while watching The McNeil-Lehrer News Hour on a tiny television set in the living room (he was obviously not much for watching TV). At about 7:10, we retired to the dining room which was set for our dinner. We watched TV for a few more minutes (the TV set was moved from the living room into the dining room), then McNamara shut it off and we began talking about my book. I related to him how three years earlier I had become involved in Kennedy assassination research, primarily because of the Oliver Stone movie and finding it difficult to believe that the military-industrial complex or the financial elite of the United States ordered the murder of the president. McNamara replied, “I agree with you positively on that.” I then outlined to him the basic conclusions that I seemed to be headed toward, which were that Robert Kennedy, in attempting to drastically curtail the power of the Mafia and Jimmy Hoffa, did not realize that in so doing he was going to take everybody down in the U.S. government who had been associated with them in criminal activities. I mentioned that this would have included certain elements of the CIA, along with J. Edgar Hoover and Lyndon Johnson. I told McNamara that I had just about concluded that CIA renegades were involved in the assassination and that Lyndon Johnson was involved. I said that as far as Hoover was concerned, I was in a dilemma but I would put"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"nothing past him. He responded, “I would agree with you on Hoover.” McNamara said, however, that he could not conceive of any possibility that Johnson was behind the assassination. I asked McNamara if it was conceivable to him that Johnson had foreknowledge. After pausing for a moment, he replied that he could see that as a possibility, though he still didn’t believe it. He elaborated that he could also see, only as a possibility, that renegade CIA people were involved, but he didn’t endorse that either. It was apparent that McNamara was willing to talk about the assassination but in no way wanted me to write that he endorsed the concept of a conspiracy or any specific allegations toward individuals. He was willing, nonetheless, to state his opinion as to “possibilities” insofar as the character of individuals was concerned and his overall knowledge of events. One thing seemed clear: McNamara did not seriously dispute that Kennedy had been killed by a conspiracy. That question did not even arise. He did not say so, one way or the other. What surprised me was that McNamara revealed an amazing lack of knowledge of the important details of the Kennedy assassination. For example, he did not seem to know that the HSCA had reached a conclusion that there was a conspiracy, and that it could have involved the Mafia. It also surprised me to learn that he did not know about the Assassination Records Review Board which had recently been approved by Congress. He was curious about that and asked several questions. He mused that he thought it was a good thing to get the files out to the public. I reviewed with McNamara my thoughts that renegade criminal activity of the CIA, in partnership with the Mafia in drug running, could have served as a motivational base for certain CIA employees or agents to join in a plot to assassinate Kennedy, the reason being that when the Mafia was brought down by the Kennedys it would at the same time expose the CIA renegades. He seemed to be quite interested in that idea and suggested perhaps that was the reason for the archival material being held in secret all these years. I acknowledged that it could have been part of the reason. During the conversation, McNamara asked the question, “What is this ZR/RIFLE that you talk about?” I explained that it was the U.S. assassination capability for disposing of foreign leaders, headed by William Harvey under Project Mongoose. McNamara then nodded that he knew what I was talking about; but it struck me as interesting that McNamara, as head of the Department of Defense, was not aware of the CIA code name for that very important secret project. This seemed to illustrate the extent to which the ZR/RIFLE program was kept compartmentalized, and how the men at the very top of government did not know much of the details, although they knew of the program. I asked McNamara if he knew William Harvey. He responded, “Oh, yes, I knew him.” McNamara agreed that Harvey was indeed an extreme character. He remarked, “Did you ever see him, what he looked like?” I replied that I had not. I pointed out that one of the most prevalent theories is that Harvey became involved with the Mafia and was possibly the mastermind of the Kennedy assassination. To my surprise, McNamara conceded that it was a possibility. But again he admonished me to remember that he certainly did not endorse the idea. During the course of the conversation the subject of Harvey came up again as a prime example of a CIA renegade who could be suspect. We discussed Project Mongoose. McNamara confirmed what he had been quoted in the literature as saying, that Mongoose was a stupid idea. I asked him if Robert Kennedy knew about Mongoose, or was in charge of it. He responded, “Oh, yes. He knew about it; he was right in there, but I would not say he was in charge of it.” He wouldn’t say that RFK actually “ran” Mongoose, but did confirm that RFK certainly supported it. I asked him if he knew of General Charles Willoughby. [322] McNamara at first said no, then continued, “Oh, yes, I do remember him.” I pointed out that Willoughby was part of a right-wing extremist element in the retired military at the time of the Kennedy assassination. McNamara added pointedly that General Walker was another right-wing extremist. (McNamara is the one who actually ordered that"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"General Walker be fired after the general’s right-wing escapades in Germany.) In our discussions about J. Edgar Hoover, I described how Clint Murchison had squired Hoover and Tolson to their bungalow at the Del Charro Hotel in La Jolla, California, over the years. McNamara said, “I can believe that.” I also pointed out how Robert Kennedy had confirmed this in a book of RFK interviews, Robert Kennedy in His Own Words . McNamara thought he had that book in his library. He commented that he didn’t know about Murchison’s connections to the Mafia. [323] Early in our conversation, McNamara made a very specific point that in his view it was impossible that Allen Dulles and Richard Helms were behind the Kennedy assassination. He asserted this with obvious conviction. He reiterated several times that Richard Bissell, Allen Dulles, and Richard Helms had been or were still his close personal friends; that he knew them like brothers and that they were in no way involved. He insisted that they would have had nothing to do with the assassination; that they were all patriotic, honest Americans. McNamara was completely sincere in this, as he was in everything we discussed. McNamara noted that John McCone may not have known what was going on in the CIA, but that Helms, McCone’s deputy director, would certainly have known if there were a CIA plot to assassinate Kennedy. He repeated that he could “ absolutely guarantee that Helms was not involved,” and that the CIA was not involved. I asked, “What about Bill Harvey and CIA rogues?” He replied that that would not mean Helms, Dulles, and McCone were involved because they could not have had total control over all of these renegade types. (I reflected that this would also apply to McNamara, who would not have had control over all of the renegade military types. After all, the Department of Defense had one to two million people in it. How could one political appointee possibly control all of their actions?) Toward the end of the dinner, McNamara remarked that he could not believe that the government had anything to do with the assassination except possibly by renegades. I explained my concept of “transferability of capability,” i.e., when the U.S. government decides to assassinate foreign leaders, and develops the capability—assassins recruited from terrorist groups, and sophisticated knowledge to carry out the assassination—we run the grave risk of that capability being turned against our own government. The capability to assassinate leaders of a country involves only assembling people with the mentality and skills to calculatedly commit murder, the knowledge of deception methods to control the crime, and knowledge of ways of disposing of witnesses. I emphasized that this capability is not like a manufacturing facility or a weapons system. It is mainly in a few people’s heads, easily transferable to the highest bidder. I added that while I could possibly agree with the justification for getting rid of someone like Hitler or Castro, the danger to ourselves (the destruction of our own government) made it not worthwhile. McNamara seemed to be somewhat taken aback and then pensive with this thought. After dinner, we retired to the living room where I brought out my list of prepared questions. My first question had to do with the book JFK in Vietnam , by John Newman. McNamara very quickly told me that this book was not factual. I asked him about back channels from Lyndon Johnson to the CIA, which Newman had discussed in his book. McNamara said he didn’t know about back channels. [324] I mentioned to McNamara that (according to Newman) Colonel Howard Burris, Johnson’s military aide and presumably his conduit to the CIA, had gotten most of his information from USARPAC intelligence bulletins, and it seemed to me that McNamara’s staff would have had access to the same bulletins. McNamara replied, “Absolutely right. I had multiple sources and I had all the information that was available.” He elaborated that he had a large staff to make certain that he had everything. Concerning the Honolulu conference on November 20, 1963 (in which the status of the Vietnam War was discussed with the top generals, military advisors, and cabinet members), I noted that Newman, in his book, seemed to be saying that this was the moment of McNamara’s “awakening” to the deterioration of"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"our military position in Vietnam. McNamara snapped that this was absolutely not true. He then asserted that he knew, without question, what was going on before this conference. [325] I asked McNamara if he knew about the rumors that National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 273 (written after the Honolulu conference) had been surreptitiously changed by McGeorge Bundy before Lyndon Johnson signed a revised version four days after the assassination. McNamara replied that he absolutely did not believe that, adding that McGeorge Bundy was above reproach and would never have allowed such a thing to take place. (This has been proposed by researchers as a device used by Lyndon Johnson to escalate the Vietnam war.) I asked McNamara if Lyndon Johnson escalated the Vietnam war immediately after he assumed office. (This was the theme of Oliver Stone’s movie JFK —that Kennedy was killed to allow escalation of the Vietnam war.) McNamara said absolutely not ; that Johnson carried out the continuing policies of Kennedy. He did elaborate, however, that he believed Kennedy would have gotten us out of Vietnam whereas Johnson didn’t. I interpreted this to mean not that Johnson had reversed Kennedy’s policies, but that Kennedy, at some point along the way in his second term, would have summoned the will to get us out.) [326] I asked McNamara about Newman’s proposition that Kennedy’s plan to withdraw 1,000 troops from Vietnam had been cleverly circumvented in making it just a paper shuffle of people. McNamara said absolutely not; the 1,000 men were taken out. I responded yes, but Newman wrote that this was just a paper shuffle instead of removing actual combat helicopters along with men. McNamara replied, “I don’t remember much about helicopters, but a thousand men were taken out. We only had 16,000 advisors and we took out 1,000 of the advisors.” I dropped the subject at that point. Concerning the Bay of Pigs, I asked McNamara if John Kennedy had refused to go ahead with the air strikes when the invasion went awry. McNamara said, “You have that wrong. We never promised the air strikes to begin with.” He added that after the invasion started to go bad, the CIA asked for air strikes which had not been promised to them, and that he and John Kennedy made the decision not to provide them. He emphasized that this was entirely different from saying that Kennedy withheld air strikes that had been promised. I asked him about the story being circulated that Kennedy approved the air strikes but that information had been deliberately withheld from the admirals and generals by CIA’s Richard Bissell and General Cabell, [327] so as to sabotage the invasion and thereby precipitate a major escalation with full U.S. forces. McNamara replied that it was absolutely not true and “not true on its face,” because Bissell was the one who had planned the Bay of Pigs and wanted the air strikes, but Kennedy and McNamara would not go along with Bissell. He said Bissell was his good friend, a very bright man and extremely capable, who had a great record having managed the highly successful U2 operation, but that Bissell simply blew it on the Bay of Pigs. He said that Bissell was the last person in the world who would not have relayed Kennedy’s approval of air strikes if they had been given, but Kennedy had not given approval. I told McNamara about my friend Jim Lance, who was one of six Navy frogmen who were sent ashore to reconnoiter the invasion site at the Bay of Pigs. After returning to his ship, Lance observed from offshore what was happening in the invasion, and that Kennedy not only withdrew air support but also cut off all supplies to the beachhead. McNamara again repeated that Kennedy had never promised air support in the first place. He said that he did not know about the cutoff of supplies, though he seemed to acknowledge that it could have happened. [328] McNamara said that the Bay of Pigs was supposed to have been a totally deniable project (deniable that the U.S. was involved) and was designed to create an uprising of the Cuban populace, which didn’t"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"take place. He added that, furthermore, the U.S. invasion plans had been penetrated by Castro’s intelligence and Castro knew about it; that Castro’s forces were there waiting for the invaders; and that all Kennedy had done was refuse to allow certain air strikes that were not in the plan. I pointed out that Jim Lance had told me that everybody blamed and hated Kennedy (everybody being the military and CIA men involved in the Bay of Pigs operation); and that an admiral during the crisis was cursing Kennedy, blaming him for the fiasco. McNamara responded that he could see that this possibly was true (that Kennedy was blamed for the fiasco), but implied that Kennedy did not deserve the blame. I also told McNamara what Jim Lance had told me that he and a team were sent aboard Russian ships leaving Cuba to inspect for missiles, and were instructed to do nothing but give away Zippo lighters and not look at anything. McNamara said that was not true because no one boarded any Russian ships to inspect for missiles. He said that the U.S. did do flyovers fifty feet above the Russian ships and took photographs of the above-decks, which was the sum total of the inspection. I asked him if it were true that no missile inspections were done in the Cuban mainland. He replied affirmatively; part of the agreement allowed the U.S. to inspect for missiles in Cuba, but Castro reneged. He added that once Castro had reneged, we were no longer held to the agreement not to invade Cuba. We discussed whether Kennedy had actually agreed never to invade Cuba, and he seemed to hang up on that a bit. He said, “Well, perhaps we did, but it wasn’t explicitly said that way.” I pointed out that it did not seem likely that we would agree never to invade Cuba because that would obviously be something that would be impossible to promise in good faith. He seemed to agree. (I later reflected that this all might have some connection to an alleged plan for a second invasion of Cuba, which never materialized after Kennedy was assassinated. This comes up in a later chapter.) I questioned McNamara about Robert Morrow’s story [329] that Morrow was a CIA operative who went on a covert expedition into Cuba for the CIA, at the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961, to check for evidence of the beginning of construction of offensive missile sites in Cuba. McNamara replied that he didn’t know about covert missions, but certainly they would not have been looking for missile sites because there was no buildup of missile sites in Cuba until May 1962 at the earliest. He said he is absolutely certain of this based on conferences he had with top military people in the Soviet Union during the last few years and a conference with Fidel Castro and Soviet top people in Cuba. He was positive there were no missile sites under construction before May 1962. McNamara was extremely emphatic on that point. (In his book, Morrow had written that he and David Ferrie were on this mission together and that they had actually discovered radar sites—the purpose of which could have been only for ballistic missile guidance.) I asked McNamara if there were nuclear warheads actually mounted on missiles in Cuba at the time of the Cuban missile crisis. He replied that warheads were not mounted, but that recently he had learned at conferences with the Russians and Castro that there were actually 162 nuclear warheads in Cuba at the time of the missile crisis, of which about forty were to be mounted on intermediate-range ballistic missiles targeted to the U.S.; the balance of the missiles were assigned to tactical nuclear weapons. He said that these missiles were stored 100 or so kilometers away from the missile sites, and that during the crisis a Russian military officer had requested to move these nuclear warheads closer to the missiles; the request was approved by Khrushchev, but no nuclear warheads were ever mounted on the missiles. According to McNamara, the CIA had informed Kennedy that there were no nuclear warheads in Cuba at the time of the crisis. McNamara said the CIA qualified its statement by stating “they could not be absolutely certain,” but in recent years, this was found to have been bad information. I said it was my understanding that McNamara recommended to Kennedy that he base his decisions on the assumption that there were nuclear warheads there, since the possibility existed. He replied, “That’s right, and we did"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"make our decision based on the assumption that if the possibility existed, and if it were true, it would be absolutely catastrophic and that we should therefore consider it to be true.” He added, “This guided our judgment and our decisions in the Cuban missile crisis.” (This, in part, explains why McNamara advised Kennedy not to follow the advice of some of the Joint Chiefs, who recommended the bombing of missile sites and invasion of Cuba.) In discussing Project Mongoose, I asked McNamara if he had ever heard of William Pawley. (Pawley was one of the founders of the Flying Tigers and later was one of several right-wing businessmen involved in paramilitary operations against Castro’s Cuba; he was also a friend of Allen Dulles.) McNamara said that he had never heard of Pawley. I asked McNamara if he had heard that Henry Luce financed private operations against Castro in the Caribbean. He denied ever having heard of such a thing. He replied, “Why would Henry Luce do that? The CIA had all the money it needed anyway without Luce.” (I did not press this further, but numerous sources discuss how Henry Luce was indeed financing a secret operation to discredit Kennedy, hoping to find nuclear missiles still in Cuba, thus proving that Kennedy had failed in the Cuban missile crisis. More on that later.) We discussed the Warren Commission. McNamara reflected that he could not believe that all the honorable men in the Warren Commission would have allowed themselves to be involved in a cover-up. He said he knew Gerald Ford personally and did not believe that Gerald Ford would have gone along with a cover-up. He added that he also couldn’t understand how Earl Warren would have been manipulated. I pointed out that I had transcripts of the LBJ tapes showing how Johnson browbeat people and used the nuclear war scare to break Earl Warren down until he was crying before he finally agreed to accept the chairmanship of the Warren Commission. McNamara replied that Warren did not want the job. McNamara contended that if Johnson were orchestrating a cover-up, it did not make sense to him that such distinguished people would have been appointed to the Warren Commission. I replied that Johnson had first proposed a Texas commission to investigate the assassination, but he quickly withdrew the idea when objections were raised against it. McNamara replied that he had never heard of that. I pointed out that Johnson was in a position of having to avoid a congressional investigation and had to appoint prominent people, and that some of these people who signed the report did so very reluctantly. I also explained that Johnson appointed Hoover as a sole investigator of the assassination and that Johnson shut down the Secret Service investigation as well as the investigation of the Dallas police. This seemed to come as news to McNamara. I then elaborated that there is a huge list of things Hoover did in the investigation that kept substantial information from the Warren Commission. This seemed to surprise and make an impact on McNamara. Concerning J. Edgar Hoover, I explained that I was currently in a dilemma because Hoover’s personal paranoia and hypersensitivity could have led him to cover up anything. McNamara seemed to agree. My point was that Hoover could have been involved in a cover-up simply to save himself from the embarrassment that Oswald was an FBI informer, or from having known about Oswald in advance, etc. I recounted the story of British double-agent Dusan “Dusko” Popov and Hoover’s refusal to listen to Popov (about evidence that Popov had uncovered of Japan’s intent to bomb Pearl Harbor before World War II) because of a personal pique that Hoover had against him. McNamara listened without comment. We talked briefly about Hoover’s homosexuality. I asked if this had been common talk in Washington. He responded that it wasn’t common talk as far as he knew, but Hoover was a homosexual and had tremendous motivation to do anything to keep that information from becoming public, and therefore was vulnerable to blackmail. McNamara mentioned Hoover’s vendetta against Martin Luther King. I reflected to McNamara that if you look at the JFK assassination, the RFK assassination, and the Martin Luther King assassination, there is a common thread among all of them, and that thread is J. Edgar Hoover. McNamara seemed startled by my statement, but was non responsive, so I went on to something else. To repeat, it was quite interesting to me how little McNamara knew about the details of the Kennedy"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"assassination. Here was a man close to both John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy, who was practically a member of the Kennedy family, yet had not followed much of anything about conspiracy allegations or theories over the years except in the broadest sense—only what was commonly known to the general public. It appeared that McNamara had accepted the results of the Warren Commission because it was comprised of such honorable men. Like millions of other Americans, including myself until I wrote this book, McNamara had put the tragic event behind him, moving on to the present from the past. He also refused to believe that officials of the federal government could have been involved. (This was the same reaction I got from Admiral Shepard, who wrote me a letter saying that I should be very careful about accusing the government of being involved in the Kennedy assassination unless I had “absolute proof.”) During the course of the evening, I mentioned Robert Caro’s story that Lyndon Johnson had his campus operatives use razor blades to cut out pages of his college yearbook that were unfavorable to Johnson’s image. I added that even at the age of twenty Johnson had his political organization in college to do this for him. I described this incident as illuminating a basic character trait of Lyndon Johnson. McNamara replied, “Well, I can believe that, but it’s a big leap going from that to assassination of Kennedy.” McNamara recommended Robert Dallek’s book on Lyndon Johnson. [330] He said that Dallek had written one book and was now working on another. I told him I had read most of Dallek’s book and had heard this praise from others. At one point McNamara confided that Hoover certainly had a vendetta against Martin Luther King and had great conflicts with Robert Kennedy. He mentioned he didn’t know about Hoover’s conflicts with John Kennedy. However, he did acknowledge that Hoover was investigating Kennedy, getting information on him about the “womanizing.” McNamara later raised the question about Kennedy’s womanizing as if it somehow related to the Kennedy assassination, but the conversation dropped at that point. Perhaps McNamara was just ruminating and didn’t make a connection. I now wish I had pursued the point more specifically. I expressed my belief that if the CIA were going to assassinate Kennedy, it certainly wouldn’t have used Oswald as a patsy because Oswald could so easily be connected back to the CIA. McNamara replied, “I absolutely don’t think the CIA assassinated Kennedy, although I don’t rule out some renegades.” At about 9:00 p.m., McNamara said he had another commitment and insisted on driving me back to the hotel, rather than my getting a taxi. During the drive, he remarked how much he had enjoyed the evening, how much he was impressed with my knowledge, and how surprised he was about it. He said, “The next time you come to Washington, give me a call.” He pointedly beseeched me to realize that, of the people he knew in the CIA and government, he sincerely believed they were doing what they thought was the right thing for their country. Then, surprisingly, as we drove up to the hotel, he added that they may have “knocked off some gangsters.” As a final statement, when I got out of the car, McNamara commented that what I was doing was very interesting but he thought I was on the wrong tack. I don’t know what he meant by that. Looking back, I see that I didn’t have the opportunity or inclination to tell McNamara about the evidence linking the federal government to the cover-up of the assassination (the autopsy, the Zapruder film, etc.). Perhaps that was for the best, keeping the discussion on the broad political and motivational issues. In my view, McNamara is certainly a most honorable man, a dedicated public servant, and an important man in history. He seems to represent the same type of thinking that I encountered with Admiral Shepard. Neither disputed that there was a conspiracy; neither would put anything past J. Edgar Hoover; but neither could believe that “government” could have been connected to the Kennedy assassination. I reflected that these two people, both very close to Kennedy and Johnson, perhaps represent the thinking of"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"the Washington establishment. Their mentality may explain why it is so difficult to penetrate this thinking. They just cannot believe that the government was involved. Who was I to argue with them? After all, they were there. They knew the people. They knew Kennedy; they knew Johnson; they knew the military and CIA people. Is it plausible that someone like myself, looking at the picture from the outside and studying the documents and available evidence and literature, could reach a conclusion that escaped these honorable, intelligent, and astute men? I could see the need for more discussions with McNamara if it could be arranged. (Before this book went to press, I was unable to arrange a follow-up interview. I telephoned McNamara once when I was in Washington, D.C., but he had just returned from a 55,000-mile trip in Asia and was on his way to Europe. His voice was hoarse and he said he was exhausted. I said that perhaps I could arrange to meet with him some other time. He didn’t respond. I thanked him and that was it.) After returning to California, I turned my attention to the military itself. Is there meaningful evidence that implicates U.S. military leaders or lower-level personnel of the military in the plot? Motives of the Military to Assassinate John Kennedy It is historic fact that John Kennedy was in deep conflict with the military chiefs in the years and months preceding his assassination. It had reached the point that Kennedy would rarely speak to the chiefs. He conducted his business with them mostly through the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Maxwell Taylor, whom Kennedy had appointed and trusted. Kennedy was aghast at the crazy antics of General Curtis LeMay, commander of the Air Force. He had come to look upon LeMay and his nuclear bombs as a threat to the human race. Kennedy had gotten into the practice of walking out of meetings when LeMay or other generals were making presentations. “These people are crazy...I told you to keep them away from me,” he once remarked to no one in particular as he was leaving the Cabinet room. [331] Privately, Kennedy had begun to express concern about a military coup. His friend and confidant, Paul Fay, wrote in his book, The Pleasure of His Company: We were out on the “Honey Fitz” again the next day, and the President said he had read Seven Days in May [332] the previous night. He discussed the possibility of such a military takeover very calmly: It’s possible. It could happen in this country, but the conditions would have to be just right. If, for example, the country had a young President, and he had a Bay of Pigs, there would be a certain uneasiness. Maybe the military would do a little criticizing behind his back, but this would be written off as the usual military dissatisfaction with civilian control. Then if there were another Bay of Pigs, the reaction of the country would be, ‘Is he too young and inexperienced?’ The military would almost feel that it was their patriotic obligation to stand ready to preserve the integrity of the nation, and only God knows just what segment of democracy they would be defending if they overthrew the elected establishment.” As if steeling himself for the final challenge, he continued, “Then, if there were a third Bay of Pigs, it could happen.” Pausing long enough for all of us to assess the significance of his comment, he concluded with an old Navy phrase: “But it won’t happen on my watch.” If Kennedy himself had these thoughts, after he had experienced almost three years of conflict with the military chiefs, should we not examine the evidence to test this possibility?"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":" The military chiefs’ contempt and animosity toward John Kennedy have been noted in previous chapters. The chiefs would speak derisively of Kennedy in public in a manner that would be shocking today. The chiefs strongly opposed Kennedy’s plans for nuclear disarmament and rapprochement with the Soviets. At times, almost open rebellion occurred against Kennedy’s policies. One graphic instance was reported by author Richard Reeves in his recent book President Kennedy . During the Cuban missile crisis, Robert McNamara was trying to explain to Admiral George Anderson the need to see the Cuban blockade in political terms—the communication of political signals. Reeves wrote: When the ship reaches the line, how are you going to stop it?” McNamara asked the chief, who was sitting in his conference room with a row of his top subordinates, all in full uniform. We’ll hail it,” the admiral said. In what language—English or Russian?” How the hell do I know? I have faith in my officers,” said Anderson, his face glowing with anger. “ This is none of your goddamn business ....We’ve been doing this ever since the days of John Paul Jones. If you’ll just go back to your quarters, Mr. Secretary, we’ll take care of this.” He handed McNamara a copy of The Manual of Navy Regulations, saying, “It’s all in there!” I don’t give a damn what John Paul Jones would have done,” said McNamara. “I want to know what you are going to do, now. What if they don’t stop?” We’ll send a shot across the bow,” said the admiral. Then what, if that doesn’t work?” Then we’ll fire into the rudder.... This is none of your goddamn business, Mr. Secretary . This is what we’re here to do.” You’re not going to fire a single shot at anything without my express permission, is that clear?” said McNamara, walking out as Anderson was announcing that the Navy did not need any help from civilians to do its job. That’s the end of Anderson. I’ll never. . . He won’t be reappointed,” McNamara said to Gilpatric as they walked back to the Secretary’s office in another wing of the Pentagon’s miles of corridors. [333] (Italics added) John Kennedy and his key people were determined to seize control of the military—a feat no president had accomplished since World War II. The chiefs resented the Kennedys and their whiz kids who had little or no experience in military command; the chiefs were accustomed to presidents who let them do their thing without meddlesome interference from politicians. Another admiral with disdain for President Kennedy was Arleigh Burke, chief of naval operations. Admiral Burke felt that Kennedy had “chickened out” in the Bay of Pigs. He referred to McNamara as Kennedy’s bagman. [334] Burke was the source of the leak of a special panel report on the Bay of Pigs that was authorized by Kennedy. (Burke leaked this information to Fortune Magazine .) The leak was highly critical of Kennedy. The president was furious. Suspecting General Charles Cabell (brother of the mayor of Dallas and Allen Dulles’s protégé and top man in the CIA), Kennedy mistakenly fired him, [335] adding one more angry general to the growing list. Perhaps the two most dangerous of all the generals were Curtis LeMay and his head of the Strategic Air Command, General Thomas Power. General LeMay is legendary for his mania to start World War III by goading the Soviet Union with unauthorized reconnaissance flights that penetrated their forbidden boundaries. [336] LeMay was another extremely crude character, á la William Harvey and Lyndon Johnson. Dino Brugioni in Eye to Eyeball wrote of LeMay’s excesses:"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"Meetings of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were alluded to by some as a three-ring circus. General Curtis E. LeMay, Air Force chief of staff, was characterized by one observer as always injecting himself into situations “like a rogue elephant barging out of a forest.” There are many stories of LeMay’s crudeness in dealing with his colleagues on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He found the meetings dull, tiring, and unproductive. Petulant and often childish when he didn’t get his way, LeMay would light a cigar and blow smoke in the direction of anyone challenging his position. To show utter disgust, he would walk into the private Joint Chiefs of Staff toilet, leave the door open, urinate or break wind loudly, and flush the commode a number of aggravating times. He would then saunter calmly back into the meeting pretending that nothing had happened. When angry with individual staff members, he would resort to sarcasm; if that failed, he would direct his wrath to the entire staff. [337] LeMay was in policy conflicts with the Joint Chiefs. He battled with Admiral Arleigh Burke over the control of the nuclear Polaris submarines. LeMay wanted them under his command and actually achieved some control in the Pacific theater. But Burke successfully fought the Air Force every way he knew—in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in Congress, and in the press [338] —any way to prevent LeMay’s power grab. LeMay apparently had grown immune to the horror of killing. He had directed the gasoline-jellied fire bombing of Japan—estimated to have killed “more persons in a six-hour period than at any time in the history of man.” He said of war, “You’ve got to kill people, and when you’ve killed enough they stop fighting.” [339] He once said, “We killed off—what—twenty percent of the population of North Korea.” More than two million civilians died in LeMay’s campaign from napalm bombing and destruction of massive dams to flood waterways. [340] LeMay was a ringleader in the Joint Chiefs of Staff insofar as urging Kennedy to go to war in the Bay of Pigs and later in the Cuban missile crisis. Kennedy wisely resisted the Joint Chiefs’ recommendations. LeMay was the foremost proponent of the nuclear first strike, saying that we should give the Russians the “Sunday punch” before they did it to us. [341] In the 1950s, under Eisenhower, LeMay had the authority to order a nuclear strike without presidential authorization if the president could not be contacted. That option was extended down to General Thomas Powers, head of SAC, whom LeMay himself described as “not stable” and a “sadist.” [342] LeMay’s proposal for a nuclear first strike and massive destruction of the Soviets was thwarted by Eisenhower, whom LeMay came to consider as indecisive. He was even more disgusted with Kennedy, whom LeMay believed to be a coward. LeMay talked openly about a preemptive attack in which one hundred million people would be killed. If ever there were a mad, rogue general who would lead a coup, it would appear to have been General Curtis LeMay. After LeMay retired from the Air Force, he teamed with Alabama governor George Wallace in an unsuccessful candidacy for the vice presidency. [343] LeMay died in 1990. In the years following his unsuccessful political race, he became somewhat of a recluse, seldom leaving his home. A prime example of the deep conflict between John Kennedy and the military involved a study of a massive preemptive strike, in which every missile and bomb in the U.S. arsenal would be unloaded against the Soviet Union and China. This study was presented to Kennedy by the Joint Chiefs. It is difficult now to imagine that such a doomsday option was seriously contemplated and promoted by the"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"U.S. military. The plan was presented in a National Security Council meeting on July 20, 1961. A recently released document from the National Archives describes a meeting in which General Lyman Lemnitzer (chairman of the Joint Chiefs), the director of the CIA, and others presented plans for a launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles that McGeorge Bundy described as a “massive, total, comprehensive, obliterating strategic attack....on anything Red.” The plan involved 1,060 bombs or warheads, 3,729 targets, and 1530 missiles and bombers on full alert. It was presented as an “all or nothing” launch. Not a “portion of the plan,” but the whole thing. [344] From the information available, the Joint Chiefs’ argument appears to have been that there would be a window of opportunity for such a strike in late 1963 without the U.S. having to suffer unacceptable damage from counter-attack. The logic was that the Soviets had very few ballistic missiles in 1961, but that by the fall of 1963 their arsenal would be built to the point where the window of opportunity for a pre-emptive nuclear strike by the United States would be coming to an end, while at the same time the U.S. arsenal would be optimally ready to launch. The meeting was described in notes written for Vice President Lyndon Johnson by his military aide, Colonel Howard Burris [345] (Johnson did not attend the meeting): TOP SECRET—EYES ONLY Notes on National Security Council Meeting July 20, 1961 General Hickey, Chairman of the Net Evaluation Subcommittee, presented the annual report of his group. General Lemnitzer stated that the assumption of this year’s study was a surprise attack in late 1963, preceded by a period of heightened tensions. After the presentation by General Hickey and by the various members of the Subcommittee, the President asked if there had ever been made an assessment of damage results to the U.S.S.R. which would be incurred by a preemptive attack. General Lemnitzer stated that such studies had been made and that he would bring them over and discuss them personally with the President. In recalling General Hickey’s opening statement that these studies have been made since 1957, the President asked for an appraisal of the trend in the effectiveness of the attack. General Lemnitzer replied that he would also discuss this with the President. Since the basic assumption of this year’s presentation was an attack in late 1963, the President asked about probable effects in the winter of 1962. Mr. Dulles observed that the attack would be much less effective since there would be considerably fewer missiles involved. General Lemnitzer added a word of caution about accepting the precise findings of the Committee since these findings were based upon certain assumptions which themselves might not be valid. The President posed the question as to the period of time necessary for citizens to remain in shelters following an attack. A member of the Subcommittee replied that no specific period of time could be cited due to the variables involved, but generally speaking, a period of two weeks should be expected. The President directed that no member in attendance at the meeting disclose even the subject of the meeting. (Emphasis added) Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., later wrote, “Kennedy got up and walked out in the middle of the meeting and that was the end of it. We never had another one.” [346] , [347] McGeorge Bundy wrote that as Kennedy walked to the oval office from the cabinet room with Secretary of State Dean Rusk, he said, “And we call ourselves the human race.” [348] The Burris memorandum was first sent to me by Bob Dorff. He was contemplating using it as a plot"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"for a novel. Dorff speculated that it possibly could have had something to do with the JFK assassination —perhaps the primary motive. He noted that the surprise attack was planned, ominously, for the fall of 1963. Could Kennedy have been assassinated in a plan designed to blame it on the Soviet Union to justify a surprise attack by the United States? In this scenario, the thinking of the military chiefs would be that only by a first nuclear strike would we be able to avoid a similar nuclear attack by the Soviets—“let’s beat them to the punch.” The generals might have thought that they could not depend on Kennedy to have the guts to push the nuclear button when we first detected the Soviets’ launch of their nuclear rockets. After all, the reasoning would go, Kennedy had failed to act in the Bay of Pigs and had failed to act in the Cuban missile crisis—and only by assassinating Kennedy and thus freeing the chiefs (if they so decided) would they be enabled to launch a first nuclear strike against the Soviets, thereby preserving the United States from annihilation. Patriotism, shall we say? After a few weeks of mild discussions, off and on, Dorff and I both agreed that the idea was so far- fetched that it barely deserved thought, except as a plot for a novel, which was all Dorff had intended in the first place. But rather than rule out the idea completely, I have included it here if only to illustrate the schism between Kennedy and the military, which it certainly does. It is interesting to note that Lyndon Johnson was being kept up to speed on this subject by his aide, Colonel Howard Burris, who wrote the memo on the NSC meeting. As noted earlier, John Newman, in his book JFK in Vietnam , wrote that Colonel Burris provided Lyndon Johnson with back-channel information on the status of the war in Vietnam during the months preceding the Kennedy assassination. Newman wrote that this was information that Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara did not have (and presumably Kennedy did not have). The information, according to Newman, revealed a very pessimistic picture of the way things were going in Vietnam, as opposed to McNamara’s relatively optimistic picture, which McNamara honestly reported to the public as he had heard it. (As mentioned earlier, McNamara disputes Newman’s contention that he did not have the best, most realistic information available from all sources) [349] From the beginning I have stated that I found it very difficult to seriously consider that our military leaders plotted to assassinate John Kennedy. It did not seem to me that there was enough motivation on their part to go to the extreme act of assassinating a president. True, there was deep conflict, but the personal survival of the military leaders was not at stake. They had their pensions and a comfortable life ahead, no matter what Kennedy did. As I write, I hold this viewpoint, although it is weakening. I am obliged to examine specific evidence. Specific Evidence of Military Involvement Two actions of the military stand out as strong indications of military culpability in the plot. First is the fact that in 1973 the Pentagon (specifically the Army) outrageously ordered destruction of all documents in its military intelligence files concerning Oswald/Hidell. [350] Why would the Army destroy these files? One might suspect that there was something so terrible in them that it absolutely should not see the light of day. In a court of law, if a suspect (in terms of motive, means, and opportunity) is caught destroying evidence, it is advocated as tantamount to proof of guilt. This would particularly apply in the case of a conspiracy. If a person who is highly suspected of being one of the conspirators is caught destroying evidence, a juror would be obliged to seriously consider that person as part of the conspiracy. A second indication of military complicity in the JFK assassination were the actions of military"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"personnel during and after the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital. It is inescapable that several Navy captains and admirals and Army officers must have: (a) been aware of what was going on; (b) participated in the deceptions; and (c) coordinated the cover-up. Yet with a few minor exceptions, all except Navy enlisted men have kept their mouths shut ever since. (This was discussed in detail in Chapter 13, The Autopsy .) There are several other items of evidence in the assassination indicating complicity of the military (rather, I should say, right-wing extremists connected to the military) that deserve consideration. One is that the first person to interview Marina Oswald after the assassination was an Army reserve intelligence officer by the name of Jack Crichton . (At the time of the assassination, he was president of NAFCO Oil and Gas, Inc. and still connected to Army intelligence.) According to information discovered in the Jim Garrison investigation, Crichton, along with other Army intelligence officials, had met with right-wing extremist H. L. Hunt shortly after the assassination. [351] (You may recall that H. L. Hunt is alleged to have secretly bought a copy of the Zapruder film on the night of the assassination and to have sent his security man to check out Oswald’s security in the Dallas jail.) Five hours after the assassination, Crichton had telephoned White Russian immigrant Ilya Mamantov, an ultra-right-winger and geologist with Sun Oil Company. [352] Crichton asked for Mamantov’s help as an interpreter for the first questioning of Marina Oswald. [353] To me it is astounding that a civilian and an Army reserve officer were the first persons to question Marina Oswald. Where were the FBI, the Secret Service, or the Dallas Police? Present at the incredible questioning was the supposed liberal Ruth Paine, who curiously was an acquaintance of right-winger Mamantov. You may recall that this was typical of the strange mixture of liberals and right wingers in Dallas—the liberals being the Paines and the Oswalds, and the right wingers seemingly being everybody that they knew. It was Marina’s later testimony to the Warren Commission that would incriminate her husband in the assassination. Years later, she would recant and state that she believed he was framed. But in 1963 she was a vulnerable young woman who could easily have been intimidated into saying what the U.S. government wanted her to say. In recent years she has stated as such. After all, she was a Russian Communist and unaccustomed to bucking the power structure, and she was subject to possible deportation. Another item of utmost significance has to do with an Army private by the name of Eugene B. Dinkin . [354] , [355] Dinkin was a cryptographic code operator for U.S. Army Ordinance, stationed in Metz, France, in 1963. He had received the required crypto clearance, the highest given by the military. An FBI report dated April 9, 1964 stated that Dinkin had predicted the JFK assassination several weeks before it happened—“that a conspiracy was in the making for the ‘military’ of the United States, perhaps combined with an ‘ultra right wing economic group’....” [356] Dinkin soon learned through the grapevine that he was going to be locked up as a psychotic. He went AWOL and left Metz, France, traveling by train to Geneva, Switzerland, where he told his story to the editor of the Geneva Diplomat. The CIA would later confirm this in a letter to the Warren Commission written by Richard Helms on May 11, 1964 and stamped “Received” by the Warren Commission on May 19, 1964. This letter did not appear in the Warren Commission Report or its twenty-six volumes. It was suppressed until released in 1976, but with Dinkin’s name deleted. The letter from Helms, with Dinkin’s name not deleted, was approved for release in 1992 by the CIA Historical Review Board: MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. J. Les Rankin"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"General Counsel President’s Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy SUBJECT: Allegations of Pfc. Eugene B. DINKIN U.S. Army, Relative to Assassination Plot Against President Kennedy 1. Reference is made to paragraph 2 of your memorandum, dated February 12, 1964, requesting that the Commission be furnished copies of disseminations relative to the assassination of President Kennedy that were sent to the Secret Service. 2. Immediately after the assassination the CIA [deleted] in Geneva, Switzerland, reported allegations concerning a plot to assassinate President Kennedy that were made by Pfc. EugeneB. DINKIN, U.S. Army, serial number RA-76710292, on 6 and 7 November 1963, in Geneva while absent without leave from his unit in Metz, France. Available details of this charge, together with information on its exploitation by Alex des Fontaines, a Time-Life stringer in Geneva, were disseminated in OUT Teletype message No. 85770, on 29 November 1963. This dissemination was sent to the White House, Department of State and Federal Bureau of Investigation, with a copy to the Secret Service. 3. Since the [deleted] cooperated with the U.S. Military Attache in assembling information on this affair, and the Military Attache reported through his channels, the Commission may have already received information of Pfc. DINKIN’s allegations. 4 . Because sensitive sources and methods were involved, an appropriate sensitivity indicator has been affixed to this memorandum and its attachment. (Signed) Richard Helms Richard Helms Deputy Director for Plans 11 May 1964 [357] (Emphasis added) What we see here is documented proof that the CIA, the White House, and the Warren Commission knew of Eugene B. Dinkin’s prediction of President Kennedy’s assassination well before the Commission report was issued. Moreover, the White House knew about this prediction on November 29, 1963, only one week after the assassination and at the same time that Lyndon Johnson was assembling the Warren Commission. It also should be noted that the document cover sheet (not included here) referred to an Attorney General file number, indicating that the Department of Justice had received the same information; therefore, Robert Kennedy had access to it. On December 1, 1995, the National Archives released an earlier CIA teletype that was apparently the initial source for Helms’ letter. The teletype, dated November 29, 1963 from CIA’s John Scelso, [358] was distributed to Richard Helms, John McCone, and James Angleton, as well as the White House (McGeorge Bundy), the State Department, and the FBI. The teletype revealed additional information, including Dinkin having predicted that the assassination would take place in Texas! 1. Your attention is called to the following series of incidents which have produced a report alleging there was advance information on the assassination of the late President Kennedy. 2. On 4 November 1963, a U.S. Army Pfc Eugene B. Dinkin, serial number RA 76710292, about 24 years old, went absent without leave from his unit, Headquarters Company, U.S. Army General Depot, Metz, France. He was scheduled for a psychiatric examination that same day. He apparently entered Switzerland using a false army identification card with forged travel orders."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":" 3 . On 6 and 7 November 1963 he appeared in the press room of United Nations Office in Geneva and told reporters he was being persecuted. He also wished to alert the world to the U.S. Government “propaganda campaign.” Army reports show that he voluntarily returned to his unit in next Metz on or about 11 November 1963. 4. Around 26 November 1963, after President Kennedy had been assassinated, a Geneva journalist named Alex Des Fontaines, stringer for Time-Life and correspondent for Radio Canada, was reported to be filing a story to the Paris office of Time-Life recounting Private Dinkin’s visit to Geneva and quoting Dinkin as having said that “they” were plotting against President Kennedy and that “something” would happen in Texas. Des Fontaines had been prompted to do this by an unidentified female reporter who had recalled such statements by Dinkin; Des Fontaine thought he recalled he had heard Dinkin say something like that also, and although he did not really believe that Dinkin had grounds for his statements when he made them, he filed the story just to be sure. All aspects of this story were known, as reported above, by U.S. Military authorities and have been reported by military attache cable through military channels. [359] (Emphasis added) Declassified CIA files state that Dinkin’s warnings were known to several people before November 22, 1963. His warnings started on October 22, 1963, when he mailed a letter to Attorney General Robert Kennedy. Later, in a civil action lawsuit filed in 1975, Dinkin wrote: I did offer in this letter a warning that an attempt to assassinate President Kennedy would occur on November 28th, 1963; that if it were to succeed, blame would then be placed upon a Communist or Negro , who would be designated the assassin; and believing that the conspiracy was being engineered by elements of the military, I did speculate that a military coup might ensue. I did request of the Attorney General that he dispatch a representative of the Justice Department to Metz, France to discuss this warning.... [360] (Emphasis added) Note the similarity to actual events, particularly the not-yet-known details of the Gilberto Alvarado Ugarte incident in the Cuban consulate in Mexico City in September 1963, involving Oswald as a Communist, with a red-haired Negro. Also, Joseph Milteer, racist and member of the Ku Klux Klan, made similar predictions. Summarizing the predictions of Dinkin and Milteer: Predictions of Dinkin and Milteer that Actually Happened Dinkin and Milteer predicted assassination will be in November 1963. Dinkin predicted assassination will occur in Texas Dinkin predicted assassination will be blamed on a communist. Dinkin predicted assassination will be blamed on a Negro Dinkin and Milteer predicted right wing involved in plot. Dinkin predicted military involved in plot Milteer predicted rifle fire from a tall building Milteer predicted someone will be picked up after the shooting Dinkin, twenty-five years old at the time, appears to have been a very astute young man. He was concerned that his message would never get through to the proper authorities. So, upon dispatching his letter, Dinkin set out to Luxembourg to give the same message to European embassies there with the thought that it would get through to the United States government. But no one in Luxembourg would listen to him except the Israel ambassador who advised him how to approach the American embassy. Dinkin subsequently took the message to the American embassy, where he was assured by a Mr. Cunningham that the message would be transmitted to the ambassador, who was playing tennis at the time. Dinkin was"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"assured that the ambassador would in turn notify him at his military base for an appointment. [361] Before Dinkin completed his journey, he went to Frankfurt, Germany, and told his story to the Overseas Weekly on November 6, 1963, which advised him to return to his military base in order to avoid AWOL charges. When he did so, he was placed under arrest by Army intelligence and on November 13, 1963, nine days before the assassination, was confined to a psychiatric hospital in a closed ward, where he remained until the evening after the assassination. He was then approached by a Secret Service agent who asked him whether he thought the plot was from the right or left. Dinkin said, “the right.” He was asked, “Why the November 28 date?” Dinkin replied that it was only an approximate date. Then he refused to talk as long as he was locked up in a psychiatric ward. [362] On December 5, 1963, Dinkin was sent to the Army’s Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, D.C., where he was given “therapy.” He was led to believe that in order to “get well” he must state that he was only looking for attention, otherwise he would be “treated” with electric shock. Dinkin said that he feigned cooperation and professed understanding of his unfortunate mental condition as being “schizo- assassination prognostication.” He was given an injection of a strong drug that left him dazed, then was assigned to a psychologist from Case Institute of Cleveland who told him to free associate to a list of words while being tape recorded. [363] It certainly seems that he was being subjected to brainwashing. It is now known that at that time the CIA and the Army Air Force were deeply involved in such mind-control experiments. Perhaps these were the “sensitive methods” mentioned by Helms in his letter to the Warren Commission. The involvement of the CIA and U.S. Air Force in mind-control experiments using LSD and hypnosis was confirmed to me in a taped interview with Dr. Jolian West on February 14, 1995. Dr. West is a psychiatrist who was director of the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute in Los Angeles between 1969 and 1989. He was a major in the U.S. Air Force Medical Corp in 1956 when he left the military. He accepted a grant from the Geschicter Fund (a CIA front) to experiment in the use of LSD and a grant from the Air Force to do research in brainwashing. Dr. West said, “...I did have these connections, it was never any secret and I never felt ashamed of it. When I told the CIA about my views on LSD, they didn’t particularly want to hear or they didn’t believe it, I told them to forget it...that it was just too unreliable for any systematic use... but they kept on looking into it. After all, mine was only one opinion. They had a bunch of other people they were consulting also.” I asked Dr. West if he had heard of the CIA attempting to create “Manchurian Candidates”; he replied that he thought there was “a psychiatrist named Ewen Cameron who was interested in exploring that....” Dr. Cameron conducted his extensive experiments for the CIA at McGill University in Canada. The CIA also provided grants for scores of colleges and universities throughout the U.S. in this program, which ultimately had the secret name MK ULTRA. Whether it was a success or not remains uncertain, although it is one of the participating scientists’ opinion that it was useful for creating patsies. There is a body of evidence (too much for the scope of this book) that Oswald was subjected to hypnosis by amateur hypnotist David Ferrie; and that Sirhan Sirhan, the convicted assassin of Robert Kennedy, had been subjected to brainwashing techniques. It is also alleged that James Earl Ray, the convicted assassin of Martin Luther King, Jr., had been subjected to hypnosis. The MK ULTRA program was sponsored by Allen Dulles through Richard Helms. The program was managed through Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, who also developed poisons and toxins for the CIA’s ZR/RIFLE assassination program. [364] In a document obtained recently from the National Archives by Anna Marie, Private Dinkin’s mother wrote the following handwritten letter (a copy of which I have in my files) to Robert Kennedy on December 29, 1963:"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"Hon. Robert Kennedy Attorney General of U.S. Washington, D.C. Dec. 29, 1963 Dear Mr. Kennedy I am writing in behalf of my son, Eugene Dinkin, in hopes that you will be able to render some assistance in the situation which has arisen. Eugene is in the United States Army, and is currently in the Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, D.C. He is being held as a psychiatric case under circumstances which are highly questionable. He has explained the events leading up to his hospitalization to me in detail in a clear and lucid manner, and I am not satisfied that he is being lawfully held. Eugene was sent to Landstahl Hospital in Germany for a psycho-evaluation because he refused to take a [purchase?] bond after having read a book (“Living Bill of Rights”) which was sent to him by Justice W.O. Douglas. He wrote to the Overseas Weekly and afterwards lost his crypto security clearance. While en route to Landstahl, Col. Dickson and Lt. Col. Black came into the orderly room of his company and phoned psychiatrist Col. Hutson and gave him a direct order to find him psychologically unfit to handle security information, and to write a paranoic evaluation. He claims this to be a frame up. Several weeks later through his data, he became convinced that Pres. Kennedy would be assassinated in the month of November, most likely Nov. 28, 1963. Military had already had knowledge that he was conducting a semantics study of the “Stars and Stripes” newspaper. He thought they knew he had already predicted the assassination of Pres. Kennedy; therefore when he requested a fourteen day leave, they turned it down, and scheduled another psycho-evaluation, presumably to have him committed to Landstahl Hospital. Therefore on November first he went AWOL into Switzerland to warn them about the assassination. (1) In Zurich he spoke with Time-Life Sec. He tried to find Mr. Kroons, Life Reporter in Geneva but he was on vacation in Portugal. (2) Spoke and explained his data to editor of Geneva Diplomat. (3) Also showed some of it to Peter De Whirst ( Newsweek ). He claims Private Larry Pullen now discharged from Metz Germany mailed a letter he had written to you, which may have been intercepted by the Army. He insists that I contact or write to you, as he knows through his semantic study how the assassination was planned. If there is any way, or if you can arrange to send some one to talk with him, some very important information may come of this. As a mother I believe him, and anxiously hope that you will see fit to look into this matter. Very Sincerely, Mrs. J. Dinkin [address] My son is: PFC. Eugene Dinkin RA 16710292 c/o Walter Reed Hospital Ward 45 Wash. DC [365] Included in the April 9, 1964 FBI report was a paragraph which recounted Private Dinkin’s statement concerning the psychiatric evaluation at Walter Reed Army Hospital: "},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"Mr. Dinkin advised that he had undergone numerous psychiatric tests at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D.C. He stated that he was aware that the Army psychiatrist had declared him to be “psychotic” and a “paranoiac.” He said that several of the tests given him were familiar to him from his studies in psychology at the University of Chicago. Because of his familiarity with these tests, and his background knowledge as to what the test answers should be, he believed it impossible that the results of these tests could have shown him to be “psychotic” and “paranoiac.” He stated that if he had desired, he could have “faked” the answers to prove he was sane even if he were, in fact, mentally disturbed. Mr. Dinkin stated he believed that the psychiatric evaluation given him by the Army psychiatrist was, in fact, an attempt on their part to cover up the military plot which he had attempted to expose. [366] (Emphasis added) The U.S. government’s practice of suppressing important witnesses in the Kennedy assassination by declaring them to be mentally deranged has been emphasized in previous chapters. Jack Ruby was so described by government psychiatrists. Oswald received the same discrediting treatment (the government found a psychiatrist who painted a picture of Oswald as a disturbed child). Also, Gilberto Alvarado Ugarte was given the “ERthyroid treatment” and threatened with the possibility of being declared to require extended psychiatric confinement. And, to be discussed later, Richard Case Nagell, a CIA agent who, in September 1963, predicted the Kennedy assassination in Dallas after he was arrested in El Paso, Texas; he was declared by government psychiatrists to be mentally unstable and sentenced to ten years in a federal penitentiary. Therefore, it should not be difficult to believe that Private Dinkin was confined in Walter Reed psychiatric ward for four months where he was brainwashed using “sensitive” methods. What common element existed among these people who were declared to be mentally unstable? They all had made statements about the assassination before November 22 that could have blown the case wide open had their statements been investigated thoroughly and objectively. Moreover, by the nature of the revelations, it was impossible for the FBI to suppress them other than by receiving cooperation from the Warren Commission, the White House, or the CIA. It should be emphasized that this is not fantasy. These predictions of the assassination, offered by no fewer than nine different people, were largely discredited or suppressed (more later on this). In all cases there is solid evidence from witnesses to verify that these predictions were actually made before the assassination. Dick Russell wrote that as Jim Garrison’s people pieced together the Dinkin story, they saw that one of Dinkin’s duties as a code breaker had been to decipher cable traffic that originated with the French OAS. [367] Garrison’s investigators interviewed some of Dinkin’s former Army associates which led to the conclusion that he had been hospitalized until he memorized a cover story. The French OAS, as noted earlier, was a source for William Harvey’s stable of assassins in Europe. The reader will recall that FBI documents show that Jean Souetre/Michel Mertz of the OAS was in Dallas on November 22, 1963, and had visited General Edwin Walker in April 1963. Therefore, it is plausible that Dinkin intercepted cable traffic in Europe from the OAS. Dinkin was released from the hospital and the U.S. Army with a medical discharge. In 1975 he filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government but, unbelievably, even then he professed that he had somehow been led by news stories to predict the Kennedy assassination. If Dinkin had been brainwashed or severely intimidated by threats, it appears to have worked. [368] Why not? People, most people, can be broken down if threatened by powerful, ruthless forces. Why give up one’s life when up against overwhelming power? Although we do not know with certainty where Dinkin got the information that led to his conclusion that Kennedy would be assassinated in November by right-wing extremists and a military group, we do"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"know that he made these predictions and that neither the FBI nor the CIA nor anybody else has ever disputed that. It is utterly fantastic that Dinkin could have made the predictions, in detail on five major aspects of the JFK assassination plot, based on piecing together information from military newspapers. It is vastly more likely that he obtained the information in his job as a code breaker. Nowhere in the documents, however, have I been able to confirm that Dinkin said he obtained the information in his official duties. This seems reasonable: If Dinkin had revealed the secret information from his code breaking, he would have been confessing guilt of violating his secret clearance and would have been subject to a severe penalty, likely imprisonment. It is evident that Dinkin wanted to be free, to get out of the Army, and to be released from confinement in a psychiatric hospital. He seems to have made the necessary accommodations. Another incident suggesting military involvement in the conspiracy is indicated by the actions of a man named James Powell of Army intelligence, who found himself “trapped” in the Texas School Book Depository Building when it was sealed off immediately after the assassination. [369] Powell was seen on the sixth floor near where the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle was allegedly found. He claimed that he had been watching the motorcade from the corner of Houston and Elm Street, the site of the assassination. He said he immediately joined with a group of sheriff’s deputies who went behind the building to the railroad yard where they thought shots had come from. Powell recalled that he subsequently went into the building to make a phone call, whereupon he was trapped. Some researchers suspect that Powell may have been one of those people who displayed fake Secret Service badges just after the shooting. Very disturbing testimony implicating the Army was reported by Colonel Fletcher Prouty. He wrote that Army units expressly trained to protect the president were told to “stand down” and not provide protection in Dallas. Prouty wrote: So few of the routine things were done in Dallas. Incredibly, there were no Secret Service men or other protection personnel at all in the area of the Elm Street slowdown zone. How did this happen? It is documented that Secret Service men in Fort Worth were told they would not be needed in Dallas. The commander of an army unit, specially trained in protection and based in nearby San Antonio, Texas, had been told he and his men would not be needed in Dallas. “Another army unit will cover that city,” the commander was told. I have worked with military presidential protection units. I called a member of that army unit later. I was told that the commander “had offered the services of his unit for protection duties for the entire trip through Texas,” that he was “point-blank and categorically refused by the Secret Service,” and that “there were hot words between the agencies.” I was told that this army unit, the 316th Field Detachment of the 112th Military Intelligence Group at Fort Sam Houston in the Fourth Army Area, “had records on Lee Harvey Oswald, before November 22.” It “knew Dallas was dangerous,” the commander told my associate in explaining why he had offered his services, despite a call to “stand down.” Like an old dog, he’ll do his tricks without further instructions. Telling him “not to do his old tricks” would be futile. This leaves an important question: Why was the assistance of this skilled and experienced unit “point-blank refused”? Who knew ahead of time that it would not be wanted in Dallas? [370] The implication of this is that the protection of the president in Dallas was deliberately withheld upon orders from above, and that objections to those orders had been overridden; that the Army acquiesced, even though it knew Oswald was dangerous. Moreover, what was the Army doing with information on Oswald, the “unimportant” Marine defector?"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":" The material in this chapter, taken in its totality, raises extremely serious questions concerning the military. Here is a recapitulation of the primary items: (1) The first interview of Marina Oswald after the assassination was conducted by retired Army Intelligence Officer Jack Crichton, who was acquainted with right-wing extremist H. L. Hunt and had met with Hunt and other military intelligence people before conducting the interrogation. (2) The Army ordered the destruction of all documents in its files concerning Oswald/Hidell. (3) High-ranking medical officers in the Navy and Army participated in the autopsy cover-up. (4) Army cryptographer Eugene B. Dinkin predicted the approximate date of the assassination and projected that it involved the U.S. military and right-wing economic groups. Moreover, he predicted that the plot would be blamed on the Communists or a Negro, and that is exactly the false evidence that was manufactured in Mexico City. Repressive psychiatric measures were used against him to silence him, as were used against numerous other witnesses. (5) An unauthorized Army intelligence person was present on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building within minutes after the assassination. (6) The Army protection unit for presidential motorcades was ordered by the Secret Service to “stand down” and not come to Dallas despite objections from the commander of that unit. Strangely, the Army acquiesced. Does all of this mean that a part of the military conspired to assassinate John F. Kennedy? For myself, my original bias that the military was not involved in the plot has been severely weakened by analysis of the evidence. It certainly appears that some elements of the U.S. military were involved in the plot. They could have been reserve Army elements, reserve Air Force or military intelligence, or, more disturbingly, certain high-ranking officers, still on duty, working with those reservists who had aligned themselves with right-wing extremists. This would be a right-wing clique in the military that has been described by numerous researchers. But there seems to be nothing substantial that could link the Joint Chiefs of Staff as a group in the assassination. On the contrary, because the Joint Chiefs seem to have been in such disarray, and to have had a wide range of entrenched convictions, various character traits, and idiosyncrasies, it is virtually unthinkable to me that they could all have gotten together and decided to kill the president, sitting around the table in a Joint Chiefs meeting. I think we must rule out that possibility. A Conversation with Colonel Fletcher Prouty In my interview with Colonel Prouty, I saw the opportunity to address questions that I had been struggling with for four years: Did Oliver Stone’s theory of the “high cabal,” based on Prouty’s theory, come close to the truth? Or was the HSCA conclusion that the Mafia did it the answer? Or was my developing theory (which by now I was calling the “bottom-up” theory) that the plot started at the “bottom”—with Jimmy Hoffa and the Mafia, then grew to include CIA rogues, right-wing extremists, elements of the military, Lyndon Johnson, and J. Edgar Hoover—more on the mark? I viewed these as very important questions; in fact, the central questions to be answered in understanding the conspiracy. I saw the need to open my mind to the possibilities that Colonel Fletcher Prouty might be right, rather than reject his theory out of hand, which I was inclined to do. I was shaken with the growing realization that the U.S. Army, or Army intelligence, was very likely involved in the plot. Strangely, the thought that elements of the U.S. Army could have assassinated the president of the United States was more frightening to me than if Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover—"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"or even the CIA—were the prime conspirators. I wondered about the reason for my angst. Was it that if the Army were involved in the assassination it could well have meant military coup, likely of an ideological nature, totally at odds with the foundation of my hypothesis that the conspiracy was motivated by the self-survival of powerful individuals. Was I in denial of evidence that seemed to contradict my hypothesis? Robert McNamara had strongly agreed with me that the power elite of the military-industrial complex did not kill Kennedy. I wondered what Colonel Prouty would have to say about that. It was time to talk “big picture” with Prouty. My conversations with Prouty started with a telephone call from my room at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C. It lasted about one hour on the telephone from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. on October 24, 1995. Prouty had to end the conversation to meet another commitment but we agreed to meet the next day for lunch at 11:45 a.m. at Joe Theissman’s restaurant on Route 7 in Alexandria, Virginia. (Theissman was a Washington Redskins football hero.) I went to meet Prouty for lunch at our designated spot, but found out later that there were two Joe Theissman restaurants in Alexandria, and my cab driver, despite my having instructed him to go to Route 7, had taken me to the wrong restaurant. I waited about an hour and a half, during which I called Prouty’s house twice but only got an answering machine. Finally I decided to take a cab directly to his home, hoping that perhaps he would be there. When I arrived I was relieved to find that Mrs. Prouty had just returned from an errand. She let me in the house and said that her husband was not there and she didn’t know when he would be back. After a discussion, we decided I should wait in the study and see what happened. About a half-hour later, Colonel Prouty arrived. It turned out that he had waited for me for an hour in front of the other Joe Theissman restaurant and had finally gone in and had lunch, run an errand, and then come home. I apologized profusely for the mix-up. He didn’t seem to be disturbed about it. We sat down in his study and I started my interview. Prouty is a very distinguished-looking man, tall and slender, of a very keen mind, and appears to be in good health. I would guess him to be in his early seventies. He has a lovely wife and family and lives in a nice home in Alexandria. I was very impressed by him as not being a radical. On the contrary, he was every inch a mainstream, solid citizen, by appearance and demeanor. Our talk was rambling, with no ordered outline. I will recount it here in similar fashion. From the beginning of our conversation, Prouty was not hesitant to say that he still believes that the “Secret Team” (that is, the high cabal) ordered the assassination of President Kennedy. Prouty did not agree with my “bottom-up” theory. His main point was that only an ultra-powerful group of very wealthy individuals, controlling the levers of power in industry, the media, and the financial world, could have kept the lid on the truth about the assassination all these years. Prouty said that when he was at the Pentagon, down the hall from him was an office which was unofficially called the “office of cover-and-deception”—thirty times larger than his office. The purpose of the cover-and-deception office was to create cover stories for various operations, not necessarily of a sinister nature. He cited as an example that they would actually develop a weapon that would not work, then slip the information to the Soviets so that the Soviets would build the weapon, only to find it a complete failure. He emphasized over and over in our conversation the importance of not underestimating the capabilities of the Pentagon to create cover and deception stories, and that it would also apply to the CIA. Prouty said that John Kennedy’s election in 1960 was an extreme, traumatic shock to people in the Pentagon. It disrupted their plans for spending billions ($500 billion, for example, Prouty said, in the Vietnam war). Going along with Prouty’s ideas (to stimulate conversation), I described a possible scenario for the Secret Team’s decision to kill JFK as this: “He is invincible—he’s going to wreck everything; he’s got to"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"go.” Prouty said, “That’s exactly the way to describe it.” I suggested that John J. McCloy was possibly a member of the Secret Team. Prouty didn’t seem to think so. (One of the weaknesses in Prouty’s theory, noted earlier, is that Prouty, admittedly, is unable to name the members of the Secret Team.) Later in our conversation, however, Prouty did say that ARAMCO was an example of forces on the Secret Team. He also agreed that a media giant such as Henry Luce could have been on the Secret Team. As I pressed him on this matter, he said that the powers on the Secret Team were mainly from “inherited wealth.” (From this, I inferred he meant the Rockefeller family, the Carnegies, etc.) Prouty made it clear that he fully supports the belief that in 1963 the real power in this country was the power elite who told the government what to do, and who could get direct access to government assassination teams if they decided they needed it. He said that this access could bypass the entire military and go directly to the assassination teams. Of all I got from Prouty, this had the most impact on me and was the most difficult to believe. Prouty agreed with me that there was no evidence to believe that the Joint Chiefs of Staff were behind the plot. I mentioned General Curtis LeMay (whom Prouty said he knew). Prouty didn’t comment when I said that LeMay might be the one of the Joint Chiefs crazy enough to get involved in the plot. Prouty agreed that JFK had frightened the power elite, across the board—banking, finance, steel, defense, oil, etc. These people, Prouty said, rule the country—the government does not rule the country, it reports to these people. When I asked Prouty if he thought we will ever be able to solve the JFK assassination mystery, he said, “No. It’s impossible; it was set up that way.” I read off part of my preliminary chapter describing Prouty’s work. When I came to a part where I disagreed with Prouty in his portrayal of the power elite as being evil, he objected to use of the word. This led to a conversation in which he compared the beliefs of the power elite to religion. He said that religion wasn’t evil. I said, jokingly, “Religion is evil.” Prouty laughed and said, “You said that. I didn’t.” (I don’t actually believe that religion is evil, except that it can be used by evil people for evil purposes.) I asked Prouty about the Trilateral Commission being part of the power elite. He said no, they were just the clerks. The real power was beyond and stronger than the Trilateral Commission. I asked him about the beliefs of some people that the Trilateral Commission decided who was going to be president. He said that they did. Prouty kept coming back to his strong belief that military protection and Secret Service protection for JFK were ordered to “stand down.” He elaborated that he had definitely confirmed this with his friend who had received the orders to stand down. He said that only some entity—very, very powerful—could have ordered that. Prouty said that he was in charge of military protection of the president in 1963 but, strangely, for his first time ever, was sent to the South Pole and was returning via New Zealand on November 22, 1963. He discussed at length how surprised he was that only a few hours after the assassination, newspapers had complete photographs, descriptions, and histories of Oswald as the lone assassin. This was before Oswald had even been accused by the Dallas police. He said that this could have been achieved only by an orchestrated cover story by very powerful interests. He said that the military had hit teams and covert teams for worldwide application. These operations were extremely well planned, with systematic cover stories making them impossible to detect. (I wrote in my notes later that evening, “ very scary .”) To illustrate how the high cabal worked, Prouty told a story of a meeting he had with Allen Dulles and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles about a very important crisis involving the Soviet Union. He said that John Foster Dulles had picked up a white phone from a bookshelf in his library, talked to a high-"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"level civilian in the Soviet Union, and settled the matter right then and there. I said that this seemed to mean that Dulles was in fact part of the Secret Team. But Prouty replied, “No, these people did what the power elite told them to do.” He said that the Russian on the other end of the line and Dulles were simply carrying out a function of the Secret Team but neither of them was on the Secret Team. The real power of the world, he repeated, is in the high cabal, above these servants. I told Prouty about McNamara’s conviction that Dulles and Helms were not involved in a plot to assassinate the president. Prouty agreed. He said that he too knew Dulles and Helms, they were his friends, and in no way could they have been involved in the plot. I asked Prouty how on earth could this Secret Team have used military hit teams to kill Kennedy without Dulles and Helms having known something about it. Prouty said that Dulles was just a lawyer and really not involved in CIA operations. He cited as an example the fact that Dulles was out of the country during the Bay of Pigs invasion. Prouty again remarked that the Pentagon was in shock and dismay when JFK was elected. He said that this happened from the very beginning, immediately after the election (not just after the Bay of Pigs or the Cuban missile crisis). He said that many, or most, military people in the Pentagon had contempt for Kennedy, but there were also people like himself who admired him. Prouty emphasized that the TFX contract was a major item, and that Curtis LeMay was enraged when Kennedy and McNamara took it over and awarded it to General Dynamics. He said it was all set to go to Boeing. It was a $6.5 billion contract (which is like a contract of about $40 billion today). Prouty said that it was the largest single military contract ever let at that time. We discussed how JFK and McNamara took away the generals’ control of the purse strings. He agreed that this was a major item for consideration as to motive in the assassination. Many times in our conversation he advised me to address adequately the cover story aspect of the assassination. He said that only the power elite could have sustained that story over the years, that this was accomplished through their control of the media and the military-industrial-financial complex. He commented that he had once asked a top CIA person how they influenced all of these sectors to do their bidding. The man told him, “Simply money. Pay them off.” From this I inferred that Prouty sees the power flowing both ways: from one direction, the power elite directing the government; and from the other direction, the people in government bribing the power elite with money through government contracts and politico-economic favors in order to stay in power. (A “special interest problem” facing the government today, unlikely to ever be solved.) When I questioned Prouty about McNamara’s seeming lack of knowledge of the Kennedy assassination, Prouty said it did not surprise him at all. He said McNamara was probably as shocked and in the dark and confused as anybody about it, as he himself was. I asked him if he thought that the CIA could have known almost immediately what had happened, after the assassination occurred. Prouty replied, “Oh yes.” He said they probably realized immediately the full details and thus started the cover- up even though they themselves (speaking here of Dulles, Helms, and the CIA top people) were not involved. Prouty talked about Oswald: Prouty knew a man by the name of [withheld] who ran sheep-dip operations for the CIA and military intelligence. Prouty said that military personnel were recruited from the Marines, Army, Navy, etc., and moved into the CIA as a matter of government policy. He said that Oswald was one of eight whom he knew about. He said that Oswald was in the CIA before he was sent to Japan and that Oswald was picked as an ideal type to be a spy. Prouty said that he himself dispatched covert teams throughout the world. He was always told to put nothing in writing. (Among other things, Prouty was in charge of supplying aircraft for military intelligence and the CIA.) He said that Project Mongoose had worldwide application, not just against Cuba. He said that"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"Mongoose operated a training camp near Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana where assassins and covert operators were trained. Prouty strongly recommended getting an authentic copy of NSAM 273 (the Vietnam war directive written just before the assassination). He suggested that after JFK was killed, LBJ did not get the authentic version; he got a revised version. I told Prouty that in my discussion with McNamara I brought up the rumors that McGeorge Bundy had participated in the revision, and McNamara had strongly denied it, saying that Bundy would never do anything like that. I also pointed out that McNamara told me there was no change in JFK policy concerning the Vietnam war after JFK was assassinated; but that JFK, in McNamara’s opinion, would have gotten us out sooner. Prouty was noncommittal. Once during the conversation Prouty smiled at me. “Of all the people that you have mentioned, not one of them has been a hot item.” I replied, “What do you mean by that?” Prouty continued, “You haven’t mentioned one person who really is important.” I later showed him my section on the first nuclear strike and read the memo by Colonel Howard Burris. The minute I mentioned Burris’s name, Prouty exclaimed, “There is the hot item!” Prouty confirmed that Burris was LBJ’s military aide. At one time, Burris was a neighbor of Prouty’s and a friend. Prouty said that Burris would know a lot. I asked Prouty if he knew where Burris was now and he said no, but that he was a wealthy oil man. (I wondered how Burris got to be a wealthy oil man. I had never heard that he was a wealthy oil man while he was a colonel in the Army.) As I read aloud parts of my section on the first nuclear strike, Prouty did not seem to be completely up to date on that subject. He was not aware of the 1961 meeting at the NSA. But he was aware of the September 1963 memo and said he had a complete copy of it. (He was reluctant to let me see it.) When I described Bob Dorff’s first nuclear strike hypothesis, Prouty seemed to react strongly, as if I had hit a hot button. (Later that evening I noted to myself that perhaps Bob Dorff and I had acted too hastily in setting that issue aside.) Prouty said that Edward Lansdale was his friend and also a next-door neighbor. Prouty confirmed his statement in his book JFK that it was Lansdale who was photographed in Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination. Prouty said that he had shown this picture to one other person who knows Lansdale very well, and without Prouty even giving a clue his friend had said, “Hey, that’s Lansdale.” Prouty said that the three tramps and the policemen in Dealey Plaza were all a staged part of the cover story. He said that Lansdale was also a part of the cover story, to provide false leads. He added that Lansdale had “nothing to do with the assassination.” (I don’t understand this. If Lansdale were part of a cover story, how could he not have been involved in the assassination? Perhaps Prouty meant that Lansdale was sent there unwittingly only to find out later that he was part of a cover story.) Prouty did comment, however, that Lansdale certainly had no idea that his picture was going to be taken at the scene of the assassination. I find this story to be strange. Everything Prouty said seemed to implicate the military, but then he said that the military wasn’t involved. Yet he talked about Lansdale having been sent to Dealey Plaza as part of a cover story. How could this be without Lansdale being part of the conspiracy? Lansdale was a general in the Air Force and part of Project Mongoose. At the end of our conversation, Prouty said that the way the assassination was accomplished was the way that Oliver Stone showed it in the movie JF K. The Secret Team, the power elite, or whatever you want to call it, made a phone call to a general and said, “go ahead.” But this again would indicate to me the involvement of at least one general and one military covert assassination team. Perhaps that is what Prouty meant by saying that the military was not involved, but it seemed to greatly stretch the fabric. I showed him my Zapruder film frames and explained my theory of alteration and elimination of frames. He looked at them very carefully, asking questions. He said they were excellent and the clearest and best he had ever seen, and he was very interested in frames 302, 303 which prove that the limousine came to a halt or had slowed down drastically. He said there was an innocent explanation for the"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"limousine stopping because Secret Service agent Greer could simply have been confused, not knowing whether to go ahead or stop, thinking he may have heard shots coming from the front or a bullet through the front windshield. I agreed with him on that, but I said, “Look at this graph which shows that the limousine did not stop, and yet Zapruder film analysis shows that it did stop and eyewitnesses said it had stopped.” He seemed quite convinced. At this point Prouty said that the assassination team could have been brought in from overseas. When I told him my hypothesis of LBJ involvement in the assassination, Prouty disagreed. He said that fear motivated LBJ into the cover-up. He said LBJ was deathly afraid that he himself was going to be assassinated, and when bullets whizzed over his head at Dealey Plaza it shook him to his roots. I asked him if the Kennedy family had been involved in the cover-up. He said they were involved only by fear and shock. He said that later Bobby came out of it and then he was done away with. Prouty said that at the time of the assassination, Nixon was actually in Dallas meeting with Pepsi Cola Company top executives, and that Nixon has told four different stories about where he was. Near the end of the interview, I again presented my argument for the “bottom-up” theory, but with the caveat that the plan could have been given the nod (approval) by the Secret Team after it had been put together. In that way, I explained, the Secret Team would have had maximum deniability, as would LBJ and Hoover. I showed Prouty a preliminary version of my organization chart for the conspiracy (shown in Chapter 8). Prouty studied it carefully and said he could agree with it with one change, which was to add a high tier of disinformation emanating from the top level (i.e., the Secret Team). I later changed the chart to include Prouty’s suggestion. Once again I stated my “bottom-up” theory to Prouty: The assassination plot started at lower levels (such as Jimmy Hoffa and the Mafia); the Mafia recruited CIA rogues; and then the rogues recruited their right-wing and their reserve-military friends, who in turn recruited LBJ and Hoover; and then possibly there was approval from the power elite. For the first time, Prouty seemed to see what I was talking about. He thought awhile and then said, “I can go along with that.” Prouty insisted on driving me to Washington National Airport to catch my plane. We continued our discussions along the way and some of the latter items were covered in that period. I suggested that perhaps I could come back to Washington, D.C., with my wife, and he and his wife could go out to dinner with us. He indicated that sounded good to him. He told me to call him any time I wanted. Summary of Key Points of Chapter 23 1. Both Prouty and McNamara agree that Allen Dulles and Richard Helms were not involved in the Kennedy assassination, nor were the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 2. McNamara and Prouty completely disagree on the involvement of the “high cabal” in the assassination. McNamara says no, Prouty says yes. 3. Nothing in my conversation with either McNamara or Prouty rules out my hypothesis of the assassination as having emanated first from Jimmy Hoffa and the Mafia and then spreading upward to include Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover. 4. McNamara clarified who gave the order to cancel the critical air strike in the Bay of Pigs operation on D-day. McNamara stated unequivocally that he and Kennedy made that decision and gave that order. The record shows that McGeorge Bundy then relayed that order to the CIA. 5. We can justifiably conclude that the changes which took place in NSAM 273 were not clearly sinister. Plausibly, they were a result of a final distillation of the Honolulu conference of"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"November 20, 1963. The primary change in policy that occurred was a recommendation to step up the level of covert activity in Vietnam. The new president, Lyndon Johnson, approved this recommendation. Whether the changes were made to be more compatible with Johnson’s desires is unknown. Whether Kennedy would have approved of the changes is also unknown. 6. McNamara’s view is that Lyndon Johnson continued the policies of Kennedy in Vietnam. I would offer an opposing interpretation: Although Kennedy’s policies were continued, they were calculatedly ratcheted upward by Johnson to a major war, the process beginning in one small step four days after the assassination. Whether this was a conscious objective in the plot to kill Kennedy, or the result of Johnson’s decisions based on conviction, or his politics to get re-elected, remains an open question. 7. There are two important conclusions regarding McGeorge Bundy: First, as noted above, there was nothing particularly sinister about the change in NSAM 273 and, second, based on McNamara’s statements to me, Bundy did not sabotage the Bay of Pigs operation by ordering (on his own or on behalf of the plotters) cancellation of the critical air strike. I can think of no reason why McNamara would not be telling me the truth. After all, he takes personal responsibility for the decision along with President Kennedy. 8. The U.S. military, or at least the right-wing elements in the Army Reserve and their allies in the Pentagon, was involved in the assassination plot. The Eugene B. Dinkin story, in particular, is disturbing and cannot be rationalized other than that Dinkin is telling the truth. I resolved to try to locate Dinkin or his mother for an interview. [371] 9. Prouty’s “high cabal” hypothesis (wherein the power elite ordered the assassination) is not yet sufficiently convincing to me, although it is possible to believe in a modified and diminished form. 10. The Kennedy assassination appears more and more to me to have been a plot involving the extreme right wing, even though the best available evidence indicates that it began with Hoffa and the Mafia. But the developing evidence indicates that right-wing extremists in the military reserve, or in the military itself, could ultimately have become allied with civilian right-wing extremists as the prime conspirators behind the plot when it matured full-blown. To repeat, this does not preclude Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover from having been made aware in advance that Kennedy was going to be assassinated. We will now look at right-wing extremist H. L. Hunt and his associates, who include an amazing range of unsavory, weird, and mad characters. Virtually all of our suspects seem to have been connected somehow with H. L. Hunt."},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"A political murder instigated by an intelligence service will be planned to approximate the “perfect crime.” Every suitable deception and concealment technique will be used. If “imperceptible murder” is not feasible or desirable, one of the following methods is to be used: a) The assassin is given a cover story or “legend.” b) The assassin, unless he can be reliably hidden, will be destroyed, preferably in such a way that his second murder cannot be traced back to the organizations (for example, he will be slugged by an infuriated cell mate). c) The assassin will be described as a “loner” and a “psychopath” whose deed was not politically motivated; perhaps he was seeking personal revenge. In many of these undertakings, including the fabrication of “legends” and the manipulation of operatives, the murderer himself may be unaware that he is being maneuvered. American Security Council (a right-wing organization started by ex-FBI agents) From article dated March 16, 1964, National Archives 24 H. L. HUNT AND ASSOCIATES In 1963, hatred and fear of John Kennedy were palpable in Dallas, Texas. William Manchester, in the Death of the President , described it graphically: In that third year of the Kennedy Presidency a kind of fever lay over Dallas County. Mad things happened. Huge billboards screamed “Impeach Earl Warren.” Jewish stores were smeared with crude swastikas. Fanatical young matrons swayed in public to the chant, “Stevenson’s going to die— his heart will stop, stop, stop, and he will burn, burn, burn!” Radical Right polemics were distributed in public schools; Kennedy’s name was booed in class-rooms; junior executives were required to attend radical seminars. Dallas had become the mecca for medicine show evangelists of the National Indignation Convention, the Christian Crusaders, the Minutemen, the John Birch and Patrick Henry societies, and the headquarters of H. L. Hunt and his peculiar activities. [372] The literature of right-wing radicalism in 1963 is replete with the name H. L. Hunt. Time and again, Hunt’s name keeps popping up as being a friend of, or connected with, or a financial contributor to virtually every prominent person or right-wing organization that could be linked to the JFK assassination. By focusing on H. L. Hunt and his associates, a pattern of something very important might emerge. Harroldson Lafayette Hunt was seventy-four years old at the time of the JFK assassination. When he died in 1974 at the age of eighty-five, he was reputed to be probably the richest man in the world and left a fortune estimated at $5 billion. In 1963 Hunt was spending about $2 million per year in his Life Line radio program broadcasts via more than 400 stations. [373] A principal theme of these broadcasts was virulent attacks on the Kennedys. In addition, Hunt was a major contributor to Senator Joseph McCarthy (being fed red-smear information by J. Edgar Hoover), and other extreme right-wing organizations in the U.S. and Europe. H. L. Hunt was one of three people who sponsored the black-border ad vilifying Kennedy on his trip to Dallas. The ad concluded, ominously, “Mr. Kennedy WE DEMAND answers to these questions, and we want them NOW.” [374] Hunt was the most vocal Kennedy hater of his time, “the most powerful propagandist of the extreme right.” [375] H. L. Hunt had given public tribute to E. M. “Ted” Dealey, head of the Dallas Morning News , after Dealey insulted John Kennedy to his face at a White House luncheon in the fall of 1961. Dealey told Kennedy that he: ...wanted everyone to know that Ted Dealey was no moron to “be led around by the nose” or lured “to your side by soft soap.” He had reached the conclusion that “We can annihilate Russia and"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"should make that clear to the Soviet government.” Unfortunately for America, he said, “You and your Administration are weak sisters.” What was needed was “a man on horseback to lead this nation, and many people in Texas and the Southwest think that you are riding Caroline’s tricycle.” [376] In 1963, right-wing extremism, typified by organizations such as the John Birch Society and its members such as H. L. Hunt, had reached pathological, explosive proportions. Although it is difficult to imagine today, many right-wing extremists at that time believed John Kennedy was a Communist. They believed, further, that the CIA was a Communist organization, that Allen Dulles was a Communist, as was the Supreme Court of the United States and its chief justice, Earl Warren. These right-wing extremists also believed that President Eisenhower and the State Department were all “domestic enemies,” either Communists or under the control of an international Communist conspiracy. A fascinating illustration of what the John Birch Society thought of John Kennedy and his assassination is found in an American Opinion article, published in March 1964 and reprinted in the Warren Commission Report, written by Revilo P. Oliver, a member of the John Birch Society. At the time Oliver was a professor at the University of Illinois and a native Texan who espoused the worst of racism, counseling that conservatives “should consider eugenic solutions to the deterioration of racial stock in America.” The senior editor of American Opinion was Robert Welch, founder of the John Birch Society and a friend of H. L. Hunt. This article, as well as others published by Oliver and the John Birch Society, are significant because they illustrate how the John Birch Society used its journal to spread disinformation linking the assassination plot to a Communist conspiracy which, interestingly, was in concert with J. Edgar Hoover’s initial reports following the assassination, as well as the elaborate disinformation scheme in Mexico City, Dallas, and New Orleans, described in Chapters 17, 18, and 19. Oliver, after first lamely deploring the use of assassination as a means to change leaders, wrote: Rational men will understand that, far from sobbing over the deceased or lying to placate his vengeful ghost, it behooves us to speak of him with complete candor and historical objectivity. Jack was not sanctified by a bullet. The departed Kennedy is the John F. Kennedy who procured his election by peddling boob-bait to the suckers, including a cynical pledge to destroy the Communist base in Cuba. He is the John F. Kennedy with whose blessing and support the Central Intelligence Agency staged a fake “invasion” of Cuba designed to strengthen our mortal enemies there and to disgrace us—disgrace us not merely by ignominious failure, but by the inhuman crime of having lured brave men into a trap and sent them to suffering and death. He is the John F. Kennedy who, in close collaboration with Khrushchev, staged the phony “embargo” that was improvised both to befuddle the suckers on election day in 1962 and to provide for several months a cover for the steady and rapid transfer of Soviet troops and Soviet weapons to Cuba for eventual use against us. He is the John F. Kennedy who installed and maintained in power the unspeakable Yarmolinsky-McNamara gang in the Pentagon to demoralize and subvert our armed forces and to sabotage our military installations and equipment. He is the John F. Kennedy who, by shameless intimidation, bribery, and blackmail, induced weaklings in Congress to approve treasonable acts designed to disarm us and to make us the helpless prey of the affiliated criminals and savages of the “United Nations.” I have mentioned but a few of the hundred reasons why we shall never forget John F. Kennedy. So long as there are Americans, his memory will be cherished with distaste. If the United States is saved by the desperate exertions of patriots, we may have a future of true greatness and glory—but we shall never forget how near we were to total destruction in the year 1963. And if the international vermin succeed in completing their occupation of our country, Americans will remember Kennedy while they live, and will curse him as they face the firing squads or toil in a brutish degradation that"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"leaves no hope for anything but a speedy death. [377] Oliver’s article continued in a diatribe in which he spewed a variety of assassination plot scenarios, all attributable to Communists. He declared that Oswald was a Communist agent who assassinated President Kennedy in a conspiracy between the “Communist controlled” CIA and the Soviet Union. He wrote that Kennedy was part of a Communist faction including Nikita Khrushchev that was going to replace Fidel Castro with another Communist of its choosing. He said the plot had been covered up by the president’s commission, headed by the “Communist” Earl Warren, who diluted the report of the FBI investigation of the assassination, which would have revealed the truth. He wrote that Jack Ruby (whom he Jew-baited by identifying him as Jakob Leon Rubenstein—Ruby’s real name) was a Communist agent and was involved with Oswald in activities in Cuba. Oliver was one of the thirty founding members of the John Birch Society. He was a featured speaker at the Congress of Freedom meeting [378] in New Orleans which was attended by Joseph Milteer (who, as noted earlier, predicted the assassination of JFK). During this meeting, plans to assassinate political leaders were openly discussed. According to his testimony to the Warren Commission, Oliver’s main source for information was a man by the name of Frank Capell whom Oliver said had the “cooperation of many former intelligence officers of the army and former members of the FBI.” The circle becomes complete when we find that Capell published under the masthead of then-retired General Willoughby’s Foreign Intelligence Digest. H. L. Hunt was a friend of Willoughby. This fact was reported by Dick Russell, [379] who wrote that he had received copies of extensive correspondence between Willoughby and the Hunt family from the Douglas MacArthur Archive in Norfolk, Virginia. Russell wrote that he had previously known that H. L. Hunt and Willoughby’s acquaintance went way back. Hunt’s former chief assistant, John Curington, had told Russell: “Mr. Hunt and I lived in New York one time for several months, at the same time General MacArthur was staying at the Waldorf Astoria. As such, Mr. Hunt knew a lot of his top generals—Albert Wedemeyer, Courtney Whitney, Charles Willoughby; several people from whom we had access to their information and data.” [380] Russell wrote that by mid 1966, Willoughby had gone to work directly for H. L. Hunt’s son, Nelson Bunker Hunt, helping arrange the acquisition of all offshore oil rights in the Portuguese colony of Mozambique. (More on the H. L. Hunt/Willoughby relationship will be reported later.) By all accounts and measures, H. L. Hunt was an eccentric, extreme character of great complexity. Biographer Harry Hurt III, in his book Texas Rich , wrote that Hunt was a child prodigy, known to read the financial pages of the newspaper fluently at age three. With his mother’s encouragement, Hunt breast- fed until the age of seven, often standing on a small crate in front of her while she kneaded bread dough in the kitchen. Finally his concerned father put a stop to it. [381] Hunt was a bigamist with three separate families. When he died at the age of eighty-five, he left seventy living direct descendants, including ten children, twenty-one grandchildren, and twelve great- grandchildren, accounting for forty-three members of the flock. [382] Hunt lived in Dallas in an exact replica of George Washington’s home at Mount Vernon. He gleefully admitted to being the world’s richest human, but insisted on carrying his lunch to work in a brown paper bag. Hunt was a high-stakes risk taker, both in the oil fields and at the poker table. (He was a genius with numbers and playing cards; he loved to perform feats with arithmetic, fast computations; he could"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"memorize a spread of cards at a glance.) [383] Hunt consorted with members of major organized crime families in his high-stakes poker playing, in which he typically held his own, but on occasion would lose over $400,000 in one game (about $3 million today). [384] One of H. L. Hunt’s wives, Frania Tye Lee, described him as a bigamist and philanderer, a professional gambler, a hypocrite, a con man, and a liar. At the same time, she portrayed him as a charmer, a gifted story teller, a romantic, and a father who amply provided for the needs of his children. [385] Harry Hurt III wrote, “From an early age, Hunt believed that he was special, that the rules governing everybody else simply did not apply to him.” [386] Likewise, Madeleine Brown, Lyndon Johnson’s mistress, who knew Hunt socially as well as in her professional capacity with Dallas’s Glenn advertising agency, told Dick Russell: Mr. Hunt and I parked our cars in the same lot, and three days before the assassination, H. L. called me over and said he wanted to give me something. It was that “Wanted for Treason” poster with Kennedy’s face on it, which got circulated all over Dallas. I said, “H. L., you’re gonna get in trouble.” And he said, “I’m the richest man in the world and nobody’s going to do anything to me.” [387] (See Appendix for my confirming interview.) H. L. Hunt and Clint Murchison Sr. were the chief Texas organizers of the MacArthur for President bid. Hunt reportedly put up $150,000 for the campaign, [388] although he denied doing so. As noted earlier, Hunt gave General Curtis LeMay $1 million for personal use ( not campaign expenses), ostensibly to induce LeMay to run as vice president with George Wallace. Yet, Harry Hurt III wrote that Hunt was normally not a big spender when it came to campaign contributions. His largest contribution on record was $38,000 to the Republican party in 1956. [389] Hunt’s huge personal gift to LeMay ($6,000,000 in today’s money) indeed seems strange, suggesting that there could have been another, very important reason for this enormous payoff—such as for cooperation in the JFK assassination plot? I have been unable to imagine an innocent explanation. Hunt was a supporter of Lyndon Johnson in his bid for the presidential nomination against John Kennedy. He secretly paid for 200,000 copies of an anti-Catholic sermon to be distributed during the 1960 Democratic Convention in Los Angeles. [390] Hunt also supported General Edwin Walker in his unsuccessful bid for governor of Texas. [391] As mentioned earlier, Hunt was closely affiliated with right wingers General Charles Willoughby; evangelist preacher Billy James Hargis; oil man J. Howard Pew; founder of the John Birch Society Robert Welch; chairman of Sears & Roebuck General Robert A. Wood; and arch-conservative, retired general Albert C. Wedemeyer, also a participant in the John Birch Society. Together, these men composed a military-religious-industrial complex of extreme conservatism. [392] Saul Freedman, a Houston Chronicle reporter, wrote that H. L. Hunt was “a political movement unto himself.” [393] It is noteworthy that General Willoughby was in the extremis of the military extreme right-wing. Willoughby’s boss, General Douglas MacArthur, called him “my little fascist.” Importantly, Willoughby was MacArthur’s chief of intelligence with the marvelous title “Chief of Supreme Command, Allied Power (SCAP) Intelligence.” He was involved in the worst of criminal covert operations and was"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"capable of planning an operation similar to the JFK assassination. (More on this later.) H. L. Hunt was an oil wildcatter—an independent, not associated with big oil. He railed against what he called “the eastern establishment ... the invisible government, the kingmakers or something equally sinister.” [394] It has occurred to me that Hunt’s description of the eastern establishment power structure sounds curiously similar to Fletcher Prouty’s description of the high cabal. Is it possible that John Kennedy was assassinated as a mortal blow against the eastern establishment upon whom the right-wing extremists in Dallas looked as Communists, with Allen Dulles, the CIA, and John F. Kennedy as their liberal tools? Did Prouty ironically play into the hands of a “Texas High Cabal” when he developed his theory of an eastern super elite who ordered the assassination of John Kennedy? Did Prouty unwittingly create a latter- day false sponsor upon which Oliver Stone based his movie JFK ? This is interesting food for thought! Specific Evidence of H. L. Hunt’s Complicity in the JFK Assassination As I looked at the possible role of H. L. Hunt as a prime suspect in the assassination, a conflict arose: Hunt seemed to have been too obvious. Why would someone planning to kill the president of the United States be so publicly obnoxious about it? Why would he have sponsored the infamous black-border ad if he were planning to kill Kennedy? Was Hunt a lunatic? Maybe so. Or perhaps he was arrogantly confident that he had nothing to fear, with his friend LBJ succeeding in the presidency and his and LBJ’s friend J. Edgar Hoover heading the FBI—that he could do anything he wished. We must therefore look with suspicion at the abundance of material and facts indicating the involvement of H. L. Hunt in the Kennedy assassination. Following is a summary of the evidence, most of which was mentioned in previous chapters: - Paul Rothermel, H. L. Hunt’s security man, told Dick Russell that H. L. Hunt secretly purchased one of four copies of the Zapruder film on the evening of November 22, 1963. - Immediately after the assassination, H. L. Hunt had another of his security men, John Curington, check out the Dallas police station for the status of security provisions to protect Oswald. Curington completed this assignment on the evening of November 23, 1963 and reported back to Hunt that security for Oswald in the Dallas jail was nonexistent. Oswald was shot by Ruby the next day. Dick Russell wrote: Curington remembered: “About five-thirty or six o’clock on the Saturday afternoon after the assassination [November 23, 1963], Mr. [H.L.] Hunt called me and asked that I go down and see what kind of security they had surrounding Oswald in police custody. I had no more than hung up the phone when a lady called who did ironing for my family. She said her husband was in jail on a DWI charge and asked if I could go down and get him out. I jumped at the opportunity, because that gave me a respectable reason for being at the jailhouse.... Mr. Hunt had told me, regardless of what time it was, to come by the house and tell him what I witnessed. It was a little bit after midnight when I reported to him that, in my opinion, there was no security whatsoever around the jailhouse. A lot of news people, but nobody too concerned with security. We did not discuss the merits of this, and I left. [395] "},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"- Madeleine Brown, LBJ’s mistress and a personal acquaintance of H. L. Hunt, stated on national television and to numerous interviewers that Johnson told her on the evening before the assassination that (a) JFK would “never embarrass him again” and (b) later, after the assassination, he told her that people she knew in the oil business and in the CIA were behind the Kennedy assassination. She also said that H. L. Hunt knew Jack Ruby and could have ordered him to kill Oswald. (See “Appendix A” for my confirming interview.) - H. L. Hunt had extremely close ties with Lyndon Johnson, having strongly supported his campaign against Kennedy for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1960. [396] (In a later chapter new information concerning H. L. Hunt’s close relationship with J. Edgar Hoover will be reported.) - H. L. Hunt had extremely close ties with General Edwin Walker who, you will recall, was allegedly shot at by Oswald in 1963. There is new information leading to the strong possibility that Oswald had an accomplice in the Walker assassination attempt: a man by the name of Larry Schmidt, who was a young, active right-wing extremist in Dallas at the time and who had ties to H. L. Hunt through the John Birch Society and other right-wing organizations. (In 1992, General Walker told Dick Russell that he had been told that Larry Schmidt was involved in the assassination attempt of Walker.) Larry Schmidt was active in the John Birch Society in Dallas, as were H. L. Hunt and General Walker. - Marina Oswald visited Hunt’s office in Dallas with an FBI agent shortly after the assassination. - Mafia-connected Eugene Hale Brading (a.k.a. Jim Braden) visited Nelson Bunker Hunt’s office in Dallas twice—shortly before and after the assassination, ostensibly to discuss business dealings. You will recall that Braden was arrested at Dealey Plaza immediately after the assassination. Braden claimed that he just happened to be walking through Dealey Plaza attempting to make a phone call, and had gone into the Dal-Tex building looking for a phone. (Some researchers believe that some of the assassination shots came from the Dal-Tex building.) Braden was arrested as he got off an elevator coming down from an upper floor of the building; he claimed that he was on the third floor making a phone call. Also recall that Braden stayed at the Cabana Motel in Dallas the night before the assassination and that Jack Ruby was also there talking with Jean Aase, the woman from Chicago who had been telephoned by David Ferrie. - Jack Ruby visited Lamar Hunt’s office on the morning of November 21, 1963, ostensibly to accompany a young woman there for an interview. - There were strong financial motives for H. L. Hunt to be involved in the assassination. Hunt’s wealth came primarily from oil. In October 1962, the Kennedy Act removed the distinction between repatriated oil profits and profits from overseas investments, making both subject to U.S. taxation. This change had an adverse financial impact on H. L. Hunt. In addition, in January 1963 the president discussed a plan to eliminate or reduce the oil depletion allowance which permitted 27.5 percent of oil profits on new wells to be tax free. World Petroleum Magazine predicted that the Kennedy reforms, if passed, could cost U.S. oil as much as $280 million in annual profits. H. L. Hunt had publicly called these moves “criminal offenses against the American system.” Also, in October 1963 Kennedy had told a newspaper columnist that the Hunts had “paid small amounts in federal income tax last year” and had used “various forms of tax exemption and special tax allowances to subsidize the ultra right on television, radio, and in print.” [397] The Kennedys had thus added H. L. Hunt to their personal list of powerful, potentially dangerous people they were observing and pursuing legally and politically. "},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"- H. L. Hunt may have been the sponsor of an incredible flyer distributed around Miami among Cuban exiles in the spring of 1963. It was dated April 18, 1963 and signed “A Texan who resents the Oriental influence that has come to control, to degrade, and to pollute and enslave his own people.” The flyer deserves detailed reading because it bundles together a wealthy Texan (perhaps H. L. Hunt?) with Lyndon Johnson and Cuban exiles: “Only through one development will you Cuban patriots ever live again in your homeland as freemen, responsible as must be the most capable, for the guidance and welfare of the Cuban people.” This blessing would come to pass if an inspired Act of God should place in the White House within weeks a Texan known to be a friend of all Latin Americans...though he must under present conditions bow to the Zionists who since 1905 came into control of the United States, and for whom Jack Kennedy and Nelson Rockefeller and other members of the Council of Foreign Relations and allied agencies are only stooges and pawns. Though Johnson must now bow to these crafty and cunning Communist-hatching Jews, yet, did an Act of God suddenly elevate him into the top position (he) would revert to what his beloved father and grandfather were, and to their values and principles and loyalties. [398] - Another item, which could be interpreted as evidence implicating Hunt in the JFK assassination, is a letter ostensibly written by Lee Harvey Oswald, dated November 8, 1963 (see photo in Chapter 22). The letter read: November 8, 1963 Dear Mr. Hunt. I would like information concerding [ sic ] my position. I am asking only for information. I am suggesting that we discuss the matter fully before any steps are taken by me or anyone else. Thank you. Lee Harvy [ sic ] Oswald This letter has been given an immense amount of study and is thought to have been addressed to either H. L. Hunt, or to Watergate’s E. Howard Hunt, formerly of the CIA. The letter first turned up when a copy was mailed to Penn Jones, Jr., an assassination researcher in Texas, on August 18, 1975, with a transmittal letter written in Spanish. The transmittal letter and note were mailed from Mexico City. The anonymous writer said that he had previously sent a copy to FBI director Clarence Kelley in late 1974 but had never received a reply. Since Mr. Kelley hadn’t responded, he said he was sending the letter to Jones, hoping it would be of help. The writer said he believed something bad might happen to him. The FBI first denied having received the letter. The handwriting has been authenticated as Oswald’s by an eminent Canadian expert on handwriting, plus two other experts contracted by the Dallas Morning News . Later, an FBI document, disclosed through a Freedom of Information Act request, showed that the bureau had in fact investigated the Oswald letter, specifically as to whether it was intended for H. L. Hunt. The result of the FBI investigation has never been made public. The full implications of the Oswald note remain a mystery, but it is clear that it is of great significance. One interpretation is that it was, in fact, a request from Oswald for direction from H. L. Hunt in Dallas. - H. L. Hunt was associated with Sergio Arcacha-Smith, head of the radical Cuban Revolutionary Council, with links to Alpha 66 and Guy Banister in New Orleans. These groups are believed by many researchers to be prime suspects in the JFK assassination plot. It was Alpha 66"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"and/or the DRE that had its headquarters at a house at 3126 Harlendale Street in Dallas, where it was reported that Oswald had been seen. - The day after the assassination, H. L. Hunt met with Jack Crichton of Army intelligence, along with other Army intelligence officers, to discuss the first interrogation of Marina Oswald. After the assassination, H. L. Hunt left Dallas to reside temporarily at the Mayflower Hotel [399] in Washington, D.C., upon the insistence of the FBI, which feared for his safety. Curiously, the first concern of the FBI was to protect the number-one suspect, H. L. Hunt, not to investigate him. If they ever did investigate him, it was not revealed. H. L. Hunt and the Minutemen Of all the militant, extreme right-wing groups in 1963, none has had more evidence accumulated against it as a participant in the Kennedy assassination than the Minutemen. A prime example of this was noted earlier: Guy Banister was a high officer in the Minutemen and was linked directly to Oswald at 544 Camp Street in New Orleans. CBS news reporter Peter Noyes, in his excellent book Legacy of Doubt (1973), did a masterful job of investigating extreme right-wing linkages with the Mafia in the Kennedy assassination. Noyes also uncovered connections with Nelson Bunker Hunt, son of H. L. Hunt. I obtained Noyes’ research notes for his book from the Assassination Archives and a copy of his book (now becoming rare) from Bob Dorff. Noyes’ investigation turned up a group called AVG (American Volunteer Group) which was a spinoff from the Minutemen. Noyes wrote in his notes: The topic of AVG was first mentioned to me in a conversation with former FBI agent Bill Turner in February of 1970. Turner said he had interviewed Robert DePugh, national leader of the Minutemen, at Leavenworth where DePugh was imprisoned on conspiracy charges. According to Turner: DePugh said the Minutemen were split into a number of factions including his original group: a Neo-Nazi faction and AVG. DePugh claimed he tried to start AVG as a front organization but others took it away from him. He apparently implied to Turner that AVG was a dangerous, paramilitary organization. (Emphasis added) What we see in all of this is a pattern of right-wing groups—such as the John Birch Society—not being extreme enough for some of their more violence-prone members, thereby spawning splinter groups such as the Minutemen, who in turn spawned even more extreme groups such as the AVG. [400] In April 1970, Noyes opened discussions with Connie Crawford of the California attorney general’s staff concerning Mafioso Jim Braden. Noyes had become very interested in Braden through his studies of the Warren Commission volumes. Crawford became so interested in Noyes’ material that she assigned the case to Joel Taylor, the attorney general’s special agent for the San Diego area. The reason for selecting the San Diego area was Braden’s membership in the La Costa Country Club, the Mafia/Teamsters mecca in north San Diego County. Taylor then contacted Noyes: He advised that the FBI had been investigating Braden, but had suddenly stopped several weeks earlier. In a subsequent conversation Taylor advised me that he had ways of developing information concerning Braden, apparently checking all his phone calls. Then, as almost an afterthought, Taylor asked me if I had ever heard of AVG. He said there might be a connection with Braden . (Emphasis added)"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"Subsequently, Noyes contacted the Los Angeles police department to find out what it knew about AVG. The LAPD had information on the local leader of the AVG (Captain E. G. Mederick Johnson, USMC, Retired) who had mysteriously died of gunshot wounds several years earlier. During the conversation, the presence of Jim Braden at the La Costa Country Club was discussed. Noyes continued in his notes: In the meantime, I posed a series of questions in a letter to Paul Rothermel Jr., the former FBI agent who was employed in Dallas by H. L. Hunt. Among the questions: What did he know about the present whereabouts of Nelson Bunker Hunt? What did he know about AVG, and was there any relationship with Hunt? I also asked various questions concerning Hunt’s companies. On Wednesday, August 19th, I received a collect phone call from Paul Rothermel in Dallas. He sounded extremely excited. He said he was calling me from a phone booth because he was frightened for his life and had to be extremely careful. Rothermel seemed astounded that I should know about AVG. He said some years ago, when he was in Nelson Hunt’s confidence, a most unusual conversation took place. He said Nelson announced his intention of forming a group known as AVG and intended to draw on the ranks of General Edwin Walker’s cell of the John Birch Society in Dallas. Rothermel said Nelson’s plans sounded bizarre. He said Nelson planned to form a paramilitary group for political purposes, and hoped to obtain a certain type of gas gun from Europe which would kill people and make their deaths appear to be heart attacks. Rothermel said Nelson asked him to join AVG, but he refused, telling Nelson: “I don’t want to be a part of anything that’s illegal or subversive.” Rothermel said he fell out of favor with both Nelson and Lamar Hunt. He said that Nelson proceeded with his plans to set up AVG and bought a ranch through a real estate broker named William H. Cies. (Subsequent investigation determined that a William Holmes Cies is a licensed California real estate broker doing business at 2540 Huntington Drive, Sierra Madre.) Rothermel said he did not know the exact location of the ranch Nelson Hunt purchased, but he thought it was somewhere around Santa Maria [California]. He said he would try to find out the exact location from his records. Rothermel described the ranch as Nelson Hunt’s West Coast base for paramilitary operations, maneuvers, etc. He also said Nelson Hunt had set up a similar organization in Europe known as Der Burd and that it had taken several assignments from the CIA. Rothermel did not state the exact date of his initial conversation with Nelson Hunt in California. [401] Rothermel also discussed the meeting at the Hunt Oil Company, November 21, 1963. He said the reception log read as follows: To see Nelson and Lamar Hunt: Morgan Brown, Claud Duval, Roger Bauman and party. He said he was convinced by party Bauman meant Jim Braden. Rothermel also disclosed that the Hunt brothers are the subjects of a gigantic wire tapping investigation in Dallas by the FBI. He denied emphatically that the Hunt family was close to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. Rothermel repeatedly emphasized his fear of something happening to him. (Emphasis added) Noyes wrote that according to California intelligence, which infiltrated meetings of the Minutemen in the early 1960s, “the rhetoric more often than not dealt with assassinating the ‘three K’s’— John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.—all of whom met violent deaths.” (As previously noted, these three were hated by J. Edgar Hoover, who—alone in U.S. government law enforcement—had the motive, means, and opportunity to assassinate all three of them and to cover up the crime.) Summarizing what this information means at this juncture: We see linkages between H. L. Hunt and Mafioso Jim Braden. We see linkages between H. L. Hunt"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"and the French OAS and Jean Souetre (or Michael Mertz) of the French Connection. We see linkages between H. L. Hunt and the John Birch Society. And, to repeat, Paul Rothermel, who was H. L. Hunt’s security man, told Dick Russell that he had purchased the original copy of the Zapruder film from Abraham Zapruder on the night after the assassination. Also, another Hunt employee, John Curington, told Dick Russell that Hunt had sent him to check out the security for Oswald at the Dallas jail and that he reported back to Hunt that there was none. The next day, Jack Ruby shot Oswald. And Ruby had visited H. L. Hunt’s office in the days immediately preceding the assassination. Moreover, we can superimpose on all of this H. L. Hunt’s “Texas High Cabal” comprised of the fascist General Willoughby and his right-wing clique in military intelligence. We also can reasonably question Hunt’s $1,000,000 gift to mad bomber General Curtis LeMay, all linking in multiple branches to right-wing white supremacist groups, religious cults, and the worldwide anti-Communist/Fascist movement, not to mention H. L. Hunt’s close ties to Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover. [402] It is difficult for me to imagine how the totality of this could not be of great importance in solving the mystery of the JFK assassination. It seems certain that H. L. Hunt was somehow involved—at the very least he knew about the plot—knew who masterminded it and who the major players were. It is also clear that he had the resources, connections, and capability to be a major player in the plot. With his Mafia contacts and his financing of terrorist organizations in Europe such as Der Burd and the OAS, he indeed had the capability—with Willoughby’s covert operations expertise—to put together an assassination team and to orchestrate the cover-up through his friends Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover. An alternative, more benign scenario to consider is that H. L. Hunt was not directly involved in the plot, although he knew that a plot was underway, but like Johnson and Hoover may not have been not privy to the details. Later, fearful that he might have been set up, he instigated his own investigations immediately after the assassination to protect himself. With sufficient imagination one could thus explain his purchase of the copy of the Zapruder film, his involvement in Marina’s interviews, and his curiosity about Oswald’s safety in the Dallas jail. Many of the other items of evidence on H. L. Hunt could thereby, with a stretch of the imagination, be dismissed as coincidence; but it’s too much of a stretch for me. I am inclined to subscribe to a more sinister scenario: H. L. Hunt could have been one of several powerful right-wing extremists—civilian and military—who were remote sponsors of the plot (which at a lower level included two or three Mafia chieftains and a few CIA rogues), but with Hunt and his close associates so removed from its execution that it would be impossible to implicate them with legal proof. With the possible exception that H. L. Hunt conceivably could have planned and ordered the murder of Oswald, only LBJ and Hoover would become implicated because of their direct actions in the cover-up, which were not anticipated, i.e., it was not planned that forgery of the Zapruder film or manipulation of the autopsy results would be required to the extent that they were, and under the uncontrolled conditions that ensued when things went wrong. This takes us to the next chapter, which discusses the possible roles of fascists, war criminals, and radical anti-Communist exiles from Europe, many of whom (perhaps all) were linked to H. L. Hunt."},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"Here one sees the extent of the corruption of American ideals that has taken place in the name of fighting communism. No one, it seems, not even Adolf Eichmann’s personal staff, was too tainted to be rejected by the CIA’s recruiters, at least as long as his relationship with the U.S. government could be kept secret. Christopher Simpson, Blowback 25 FASCISTS AND WAR CRIMINALS In 1992, while attending a symposium on the JFK assassination in Dallas, I met a medical doctor and another man attending with his son, who was perhaps sixteen years of age, and very bright. At dinner we all talked at length about the assassination, during which I expressed my views, then strongly held, that the Mafia was the prime mover behind the conspiracy. All of my dinner companions disagreed. The doctor asked me if I had heard of the Gehlen organization. I told him I had not. The dinner ended soon after and I thought that would be the last of it. But two days later, in the final hour of the conference, the bright young man came up to me and handed me a paper that he thought I should read. It was an article entitled “The Nazi Connection to the JFK Assassination” by Mae Brussell, of whom I had never heard. I would learn later that Brussell was considered to be a leftist radical by many respected conspiracy researchers. (Bob Dorff warned me that even mentioning her name would bring criticism from other researchers. Later, I would find more “respectable” sources for the information in this chapter.) Nonetheless, Brussell’s article would be my introduction to how ex-Nazi spies and Nazi collaborators in Eastern Europe and the Ukraine, many of whom were involved in mass extermination of Jews, had become an integral part of the U.S. intelligence network after World War II, and how they had played a major, perhaps decisive, role in shaping U.S. foreign policy, particularly with regard to the Cold War and our anti-Communist policies. As I contemplate this study I anticipate that there will not be enough substantial evidence to conclusively implicate this array of heinous characters in the JFK assassination. This is, however, yet another example of the seemingly endless avenues of investigation that should not be overlooked. There are several central figures to be studied. I will begin with General Reinhard Gehlen, Adolph Hitler’s chief of Eastern European and Soviet intelligence during World War II. General Reinhard Gehlen In the closing months of World War II, master Nazi spy General Reinhard Gehlen, along with his extensive organization of German spies and murderers, developed a secret plan to defect, en masse , to the United States. Through the actions of Allen Dulles (with the approval of top officials in U.S. intelligence) they negotiated a secret treaty to implement the mass defection. This malodorous apparatus thus became the foundation of U.S. intelligence for espionage activities against the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe. Recruited along with these Nazis and killers were rocket engineer Wernher von Braun (a member of Hitler’s infamous SS) and about 1800 other Nazi scientists in a race against the Russians at the end of the war. Also recruited were Nazi psychiatrists who had experimented in mind control through hypnosis and drugs. These fiendish experimenters would later become part of the CIA’s massive mind-control program to attempt to create robot assassins. The rationale was, of course, realpolitik —no room for sentimental morality—the enemy was now the Soviet Union and we should use any tool available in the upcoming battle for survival against the Communists. The end justifies the means, so it goes. "},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"In his exceptional book Blowback , Christopher Simpson wrote: General Gehlen, however, proved to be the most important of them all. He was a scrawny man— at five feet eight and a half inches he weighed less than 130 pounds at the time of his surrender— with an arrogant demeanor and a violent temper that got worse as he grew older. But he also had extraordinary powers of concentration and a jeweler’s attention to detail, both of which served him well in his remarkable thirty-seven-year career as a spy master. [403] According to generally accepted estimates, Gehlen was furnished with $200 million by the United States to finance his spy organization operating against the Soviets. During the first decade following the war, the United States provided those funds and employed about 4,000 of Gehlen’s intelligence operatives full time, plucking Gehlen’s organization intact from the wreckage of World War II, complete with their secret files on microfilm. [404] Gehlen developed a remarkably close rapport and friendship with Allen Dulles. [405] When Gehlen finally retired in 1968, Dulles gave him an expensive Swiss chalet. One of the many speculations surrounding the Kennedy assassination is that the Gehlen organization actually carried out the assassination through South American Nazis in exile. Although this is one of the more bizarre scenarios, it is worth keeping in mind as we continue. It would have made some sense. Could it be that a fantastic, Ludlum-like combination of evil Nazis, U.S. intelligence officers such as General Charles Willoughby, right-wing oil men, and Mafioso killed JFK, after obtaining the cooperation of LBJ and Hoover? Would this fit into the theories thus far developed in this book, which include French OAS terrorists as the actual killers? I start with Reinhard Gehlen in this story because his incorporation into U.S. intelligence brought with him many characters from Eastern Europe—Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ukraine, as well as Latvian countries—and allowed the Odessa [406] to flourish over the years. The Odessa, you may remember, is the secret Nazi organization formed in the waning years of Hitler’s regime, designed to relocate and conceal tens of thousands of SS, war criminals, and mass murderers—to Argentina, Paraguay, South Africa, Madrid, and Egypt. The Odessa confiscated three tons of gold from the SS treasury (primarily obtained from melting down gold fillings and jewelry scavenged from the Nazi death camps), tens of thousands of carats of precious stones, and currencies worth perhaps a billion dollars, [407] which they deposited in Swiss banks, and then systematically set out to achieve their twin goals of saving their hides and, many believe, arming to reestablish the Third Reich at some future time. Carl Oglesby [408] wrote persuasively that Gehlen’s organization (called the Org) was formed for the primary purpose of providing a shield for the Odessa and its criminal activities: This final element of the Odessa was the so-called Gehlen Organization (the Org), the Nazi intelligence system that sold itself to the U.S. at the end of the war. It was by far the most audacious, most critical, and most essential part of the entire Odessa undertaking.... [409] Oglesby went on to write that “...Gehlen’s fabled post-war organization was in large part staffed by SS Nazis who are positively identified with the Odessa....without his organization as a screen, the various Odessa projects would have been directly exposed to American intelligence....” [410] Oglesby continued: The military intelligence historian Colonel William Corson put it most succinctly, “Gehlen’s"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"organization was designed to protect the Odessa Nazis. It amounts to an exceptionally well- orchestrated diversion.” The only intelligence provided by the Gehlen net to the United States was intelligence selected specifically to worsen East-West tensions and increase the possibility of military conflict between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. [411] The reach of Gehlen’s Org extended all over Eastern Europe to encompass anti-Communists, pro- Nazis, and quislings. This included the Ukrainian émigré organization OUN, [412] which became the root of the ABN (presently to be discussed) and the Hungarian anti-Communist, Nazi collaborators party which included Ferenc Nagy. Like many topics we touch in this book, we would need to write another book to cover this subject adequately. But my objective is to focus as sharply and succinctly as possible on the JFK assassination and how to relate this material directly to it. One person under the influence, or a part of, the Gehlen network—who stands out as being important—is Ferenc Nagy, a fascist from Hungary. Ferenc Nagy, Clay Shaw, and the CIA Ferenc Nagy was the exiled former premier of Hungary and the former head of its leading anti- Communist political party. [413] He had been a Nazi collaborator (war-time cabinet minister in the pro- Hitler Hungarian government) [414] and, upon his exile, had worked actively in anti-Communist movements with the particular goal of persuading the United States to intervene on behalf of the anti- Communists in then-Communist-controlled Hungary. What makes Nagy of importance in our analysis is that his name is linked, by unimpeachable documents, to Clay Shaw, now undoubted former CIA contract agent, and the man whom Jim Garrison accused of being part of the conspiracy to assassinate John Kennedy. There is much to be said about Nagy. As an anchor point for our discussions, refer to Exhibit 25-1 which is a copy of a U.S. State Department document dated November 27, 1958, showing unequivocally that Clay Shaw was on the board of directors of an affiliate of an entity called Permindex Corporation. This affiliate, herein called CMC, was the Rome World Trade Center (Centro Mondiale Commerciale). Its president was Ferenc Nagy. Permindex and CMC are widely alleged to have been a CIA front company that participated with the French OAS in its assassination attempts on French president Charles de Gaulle. [415] Through this we have a linkage to Jean Souetre and QJ/WIN (the French Connection). Moreover, a major shareholder in Permindex, and CMC as well, was a man by the name of Major Louis M. Bloomfield [416] of Montreal, Canada, who was allegedly visited by Clay Shaw and David Ferrie in Montreal one day in late 1961 or early 1962. This was reported by Jim Garrison in his book, Trail of the Assassins . [417]"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"Exhibit 25-1.

Both Nagy and Shaw were also president and director of Permindex, based in Basel, Switzerland. Centro Mondiale Commerciale (the World Trade Center) was originally formed in Montreal, Canada (Garrison, p. 100). Clay Shaw was head of the World Trade Center in New Orleans and was a CIA contract agent. Garrison obtained this evidence from Jules Ricco Kimble, an unsavory witness whom Garrison described as “a member of far-right groups like the Minutemen and the Ku Klux Klan.” [418] Kimble said that he was asked to accompany David Ferrie, Clay Shaw, and a heavy-set, dark-skinned Mexican or Cuban in his early or mid thirties on a plane trip to Montreal, with Ferrie piloting a Cessna 172. Of additional interest concerning Major Bloomfield is that he had worked for the OSS in World War II, which later evolved to become the CIA. Another significant piece of information was reported in a Canadian newspaper, Le Devoir , in early 1967, referring to Ferenc Nagy: “Nagy...maintains close ties with the C.I.A. which link him to the Miami Cuban colony.” [419] It is noteworthy that Ferenc Nagy resided in Dallas, Texas, at the time of the Kennedy assassination.

Major General Charles Willoughby and Spas T. Raikin A man by the name of Spas T. Raikin was the first person who met Lee Harvey Oswald and Marina when they disembarked from the steamship Maasdam in Hoboken, New Jersey, on June 13, 1962, as the Oswalds arrived fresh from Russia by way of a mysterious two-day layover in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. [420] In the Warren Commission Report, Raikin was described as a representative of the Travelers Aid Society. The report states that when he met the Oswalds he referred them to the New York City Department of Welfare, which helped them find a room at the Time Square Hotel. The welfare department called Oswald’s brother Robert, who immediately sent $200 to pay for transportation to Fort Worth. After first refusing to accept the money, Oswald relented, and he and Marina departed on the afternoon of June 14 from New York, by plane, to Dallas-Fort Worth. It turns out that Raikin was more than a mere representative of the Travelers Aid Society. He was secretary general of the American Friends of the Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations (the ABN), an extreme right-wing, anti-Communist organization with Nazi and fascist roots in the Ukraine of the Soviet Union. [421] How strange it is that a man in Raikin’s position would be greeting the poor unfortunate Oswalds to give his kindly help, out of the goodness of his heart. It should be noted that the ABN was an organization formed to lobby the Congress of the United States on behalf of captive nations under the Soviet Communist yoke. It was described by Russ Bellant as “the high council for the expatriate nationalist groups that formed the police, military, and militia units that worked with Hitler during World War II.” [422] Raikin had a rather significant position with the ABN. What was he doing greeting the Oswalds? Raikin’s greeting of Oswald takes on more significance when we find that the ABN was supported heavily by General Charles Willoughby: Significantly, the name of the ABN’s founder and leader, Yaroslaw Stetzko, was on the masthead of Willoughby’s Foreign Intelligence Digest. [423] As discussed in the previous chapter, Willoughby is of specific interest in the JFK assassination because he was closely linked to extreme right-wing oil man H. L. Hunt, the “Texas High Cabal,” and retired Army intelligence officers. Willoughby was also very active in anti-Communist extremist organizations in Europe, Japan, and Korea, and had access to the OAS, the French terrorist organization intent on assassinating Charles de Gaulle. General Walker was involved with H. L. Hunt, the John Birch Society, and General Willoughby. Walker met with Jean Souetre, the French terrorist, in Dallas in April 1963. Souetre, or someone using his name, later showed up in the Dallas area at the time of the JFK assassination; and Souetre was in a meeting with the CIA’s E. Howard Hunt in Spain in 1963. Willoughby was seventy-one years old at the time of the Kennedy assassination. He was born in 1892 in Heidelberg, Germany, and migrated with his parents to the United States when he was eighteen. [424] Dick Russell first wrote of Willoughby’s connection to the Kennedy assassination: "},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"His name first came to my attention in an anonymous letter, a response to the first article I wrote in 1975 about the assassination. If I wanted to “solve” the great mystery, I was advised to examine the career of someone identified only as “Tscheppe-Weidenbach,” born in Heidelberg, Germany, in 1892. It was only recently that I discovered that Adolf Tscheppe-Weidenbach was the original name of Charles Willoughby . [425] Willoughby has been described as a bull of a man (6 feet 3 inches tall and 220 pounds) who spoke with a German accent and affected a monocle. He was fluent in four languages. He had a reputation for being autocratic and arrogant. [426] As noted earlier, he became chief of intelligence in the Pacific for General MacArthur, who referred to him as “my little fascist.” [427] Willoughby had received decorations from Benito Mussolini while serving as a military attaché in Ecuador. He had been toasted in Spain by the secretary general of the Falangist Party (fascists) as a “fellow Falangist and Reactionary.” In a final gesture to Spain’s fascism in 1952, Willoughby lobbied Congress to authorize $100 million for Spain’s dictator, Francisco Franco. [428] (This brings to mind that the Odessa was also active in Madrid.) Russell wrote that it is not stretching the point to say that Willoughby was a racist and an anti-Semite. In 1939 Willoughby had written of the Italian dictator Mussolini: “Historical judgment, freed from the emotional haze of the moment, will credit Mussolini with wiping out a memory of defeat by re-establishing the traditional military supremacy of the white race. ” [429] Bruce Cumings, in his monumental work The Origins of the Korean War, Volume II, wrote of Willoughby: Willoughby was a profound racist and anti-Semite who saw the Soviet bloc as “the historical continuity of Mongoloid-PanSlavism.’ ” He once wrote that “when the teeming millions of the Orient and the tropics got their hands on magazine rifles, Kipling’s white man was on the way out.” He deplored Asian wars in which “illiterate Chinese coolies” wiped out American draftees, given that “the white man is an expensive and limited commodity.” When The American Mercury was filled with virulently anti-Semitic tracts, Willoughby wrote articles for it—referring to the New York press as a “stronghold of Jewry” and the like. His “intelligence digest” recommended all through the 1960s that various “weapons of mass destruction,” unspecified, be used against the Vietnamese people. It is hard to find something nice to balance this account. Willoughby was a thoroughly loathsome person whose entire world view consisted of piles of ethnic stereotypes; he was apparently capable of anything . [430] (Emphasis added) (It is important to keep in mind that Joseph Milteer, who predicted the Kennedy assassination, was also associated with white supremacist organizations and extreme anti-Communist right-wing organizations that were part of Willoughby’s network. It could have been through these associations that Milteer learned of the impending Kennedy assassination before he blabbed it to Miami police informant Bill Somersett.) Cumings wrote that Willoughby considered President Eisenhower and the Republicans to be part of “a clever conspiratorial move to perpetuate the vampire hold of the Roosevelt-Truman mechanism.... His [Willoughby’s] paranoia extended to the destruction of classified documentation so that it would not fall into the hands of evil malefactors like Gordon W. Prange, the great historian of Pearl Harbor, a matter of great moment also for the classified record of the Korean War—with which Willoughby tampered....” [431]"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":" Cumings continued: During the Occupation of Japan and the Korean War Willoughby maintained clandestine ties to Japanese militarists, including the bacteriological warfare criminal General Ishii; in the 1950s and 1960s he claimed to have close ties to Reinhard Gehlen and other former Nazi officers then being used by United States intelligence in the cold war. After MacArthur’s sacking, Willoughby frequently visited Spain, and claimed to have been involved in the American military base negotiations with Franco. He set up a kind of right-wing internationale called the “international comité,” using money from the Hunt brothers in Texas, linking Spain and Portugal together with German right-wingers, the Hargis Crusade, and others. He was an agent for Hunt Oil in seeking offshore oil rights in the Portuguese colony of Mozambique. [432] (Emphasis added) During World War II, as Willoughby ran MacArthur’s intelligence in the Pacific, he became a rival of OSS head William Donovan; this rivalry lasted for many years. Willoughby successfully resisted the efforts of Donovan and the OSS to take over the Pacific theatre. [433] The OSS later became the CIA, so Willoughby had the foundation for being a rival of the CIA. If, in fact, there were a faction of retired U.S. military intelligence that set up the CIA as a false sponsor in the JFK assassination, Willoughby would be a logical suspect. Of particular importance in the Hunt/Willoughby story is their shared opposition to the eastern establishment internationalists as represented by the “old boy network,” recruited from Ivy-League universities to run the CIA and the Department of State. H. L. Hunt was a venomous opponent of “world government,” which he considered to be a Communist plot, backed by international firms, bankers, and stateless people—especially Jews. Cumings wrote that “H. L. Hunt could barely think of the major oil firms and banks without a knee-jerk outburst....” [434] Willoughby shared the same opinion, finding the Carnegie Foundation full of “one-world fanatics, hell-bent to put up a tyrannical U.N.” Hunt’s and Willoughby’s colleague, John Flynn, linked Dean Acheson, Alger Hiss, John Vincent, and Averell Harriman to the “One-Worlders and pro-pinks,” who supported FDR’s “grand design for a world federation....” Their targets were John J. McCloy, Harriman, the Chase Bank of New York, and the Wall Street Journal . [435] Cumings wrote: If it is difficult to imagine that a man of Harriman’s great wealth and cold war temperament might be a hidden communist sympathizer, it is also important to remember that James Angleton, long the head of CIA Counter-Intelligence, launched his “Project DINOSAUR” to smoke Harriman out as the long-sought Soviet mole within the intelligence “community.” [436] [437] Willoughby was paranoid about the CIA. He blamed them, not totally without foundation, for the premature end of his military intelligence career. The CIA managed to shape information to place the full blame on Willoughby for the intelligence failure in not predicting the entry of the Chinese across the Yalu River, resulting in a humiliating retreat and temporary defeat of American forces in Korea. Cumings wrote that Willoughby: ...spent the rest of his life, gnawing the carpet. Willoughby’s later writings for the Intelligence Digest show a highly developed case of paranoia, but of the most excruciating kind: the paranoia of one with much to be paranoid about. [438]"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":" An hypothesis that one aim of the plot to kill Kennedy was to destroy the CIA has increasing merit the more it is examined. The Texas High Cabal, by one fell swoop, would have struck a fatal blow to the Kennedys, the CIA, and the one-worlders, ridding the nation of its mortal threats—or so they might have obsessed. Willoughby became involved in postwar anti-Communist activities in Japan. Dick Russell wrote: Just as the OSS and later the CIA had forged alliances enlisting New York, Sicilian, and Corsican gangsters in the battles against Nazism and then communism, so did Willoughby hire mobsters for postwar “dirty tricks” against the Japanese Communist Party and others . Yoshio Kodama, future leader of the Yakuza crime syndicate (as well as CIA contract agent and Lockheed lobbyist) bargained his way out of jail as a “Class A” war criminal. Kodama had made a fortune while setting up a Japanese spy network in Shanghai, much of it in opium smuggling. [439] (Emphasis added) Note that Willoughby would not have found it a new experience to be involved with mobsters to kill JFK. After retiring from the Army, Willoughby became involved in the “red smear” campaigns of Senator Joseph McCarthy [440] and Richard Nixon, appearing before Congress with names provided by J. Edgar Hoover to add to the smear list. [441] So it is little wonder that Willoughby would end up in close company with H. L. Hunt, the rabid Kennedy hater and fanatical anti-Communist from Dallas. Willoughby, Der Burd, and H. L. Hunt Thus far we see meaningful connections between General Gehlen, Spas T. Raikin, Ferenc Nagy, Clay Shaw, David Ferrie, General Willoughby, and H. L. Hunt which seem to lead into the heart of the JFK assassination. We will now examine the subject of the mysterious tube-shaped gas gun. This device was for use in assassinations to induce apparent heart attacks that were untraceable. The relevancy of the gas gun is that Nelson Bunker Hunt, according to Paul Rothermel, Jr. (via CBS reporter Peter Noyes), was very much interested in this weapon for use in Hunt’s paramilitary operation in California. (See Chapter 24.) Moreover, the weapon takes us to the Ukraine of the old Soviet Union, the origin of the ABN represented by Raikin, who met the Oswalds when they got off the boat returning from Russia. There is also a Ukrainian connection of White Russians in the Dallas-Fort Worth area who befriended the Oswalds when they returned there. In addition, the organization Der Burd is believed to be the same as the Nightingales, an extreme right-wing organization in West Germany financed by H. L. Hunt, with which Willoughby was connected. For the benefit of readers who have an appetite for fiendish mechanisms, I have included a drawing of the gas gun. A double-barreled version of this weapon was used by Bogdan Stashinsky to kill Stefan Bandera, the anti-Soviet leader of OUN, on orders of the KGB on October 15, 1959. The weapon was developed by the Soviet KGB."},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"Reconstruction sketch of the poison-spray weapon issued by the Soviet’s KGB to Bogdan Stashinsky and used by him to kill Dr. Lev Rebet. It was 8 inches long and less than an inch in diameter. [Source: Karl Anders, Murder to Order (New York: Devin-Adair, 1967, pp. 79, 80)] When Stashinsky killed Bandera and Rebet, [442] he simply got close to them with the weapon concealed in a folded newspaper, pressed the trigger, and released a cloud of cyanide gas, causing the almost instantaneous death of the victims. The assassin also inhaled some of the gas, which would have killed him had he not taken an antidote thirty minutes before the murder, followed by an antidote shortly after the murder. (Prussic acid would later be substituted in the poison ampule for cyanide.) In a later trial in Germany, Stashinsky, guilt-ridden, confessed to the crime. As will be discussed later, this weapon was of keen interest to Army intelligence. Richard Case Nagell mentioned to Dick Russell that it was one of several exotic weapons that U.S. intelligence had acquired. Nagell was part of Army intelligence in Korea under General Willoughby, although it has not been established that Nagell knew him directly. Nagell was only a captain at the time, so he may not have known the general. Willoughby and Ukrainian-American Lev Dobrionsky were the two leading supporters of the ABN in the United States. Both men were associated with the American Security Council, formed by ex-FBI agents. [443] (See the quotation at the beginning of Chapter 24 to get an idea of the amazing sophistication of the American Security Council about covert assassination methods. The quotation describes to a tee the plot used to kill Kennedy. Keep in mind, also, that William Harvey was an ex-FBI agent and that this scenario mirrors his concepts for the ZR/RIFLE program to assassinate foreign leaders.) Dobrionsky was an OSS officer in Germany in World War II, working under Bill Donovan. Both Willoughby and Dobrionsky were violently opposed to what they considered pro-Soviet sympathies of the CIA. Dobrionsky was linked to David Atlee Phillips in Mexico City through Cuba’s Salvador Díaz Verson, who sat on the same board of directors for the World Anti-Communist Congress for Freedom and Liberation. Díaz Verson allegedly became one of David Atlee Phillips’s agents in Mexico City, and was one of the sources of disinformation which attempted to implicate Oswald as being an agent of Cuba immediately after the assassination. [444] These linkages can be developed much further to include an almost endless array of ex-Nazis that make up the Willoughby/ H. L. Hunt worldwide network. But what we have already described should be enough to support the allegation that there are practically no blank spaces insofar as Willoughby/Hunt and the Texas High Cabal having the capability to plot and carry out the assassination of John Kennedy. All of this, of course, does not prove that the Texas High Cabal actually did mastermind the plot to kill Kennedy. Motive, means, and opportunity are not enough to prove a crime. But what has been"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"developed here sufficiently removes uncertainty about H. L. Hunt’s capability to be behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The reader by now might be saying, “This is too much! The whole world is becoming involved in this scenario.” But let us consider: What we see here is a worldwide, right-wing network of Fascists, militarists, and radical anti-Communists; yet only a relative few of these people, three or four, need to have been involved in the full scope of the plot. And people like Willoughby and H. L. Hunt need only to have been involved as sponsors, in a plan using cutouts whereby the dirty work and exposure to being caught could have been delegated to a small number of professionals and lower-level operators with no traceable linkage to the top. Of course, the existence of parts of the plot could become known to people like Milteer and the others who would brag about inside knowledge of the impending assassination. As earlier quoted, it is impossible to keep an assassination plot a secret. Even David Sanchez Morales could well have been part of the right-wing clique in U.S. intelligence and the military, yet he himself not known the full nature of the plot. David Atlee Phillips, likewise, could have been one of the Kennedy haters (he once remarked that he would like to piss on Kennedy’s grave) who were swept into the crime of the century, even unwittingly. If we go back to the organization chart in Chapter 8, we see it is entirely feasible for Willoughby and H. L. Hunt to have been part of the “committee of patriots” shown on the chart. Somewhere along the way in writing this book, I began to see the Kennedy assassination as a phenomenon that arose spontaneously, culminating in a few people out of the legions of Kennedy haters, paranoid anti-Communists, criminals, and crazies that seem always to exist in the world. The facts that the survival of Hoffa and certain Mafia chiefs was threatened and Hoovers and Johnson’s power and freedom were in jeopardy unless Kennedy were to die, were all part of the perfect concomitance to allow the plotters to sponsor the crime, see that it got carried out, and go scot-free, even though a few things went wrong. We will now return to a narrower focus, looking at the anti-Castro Cubans and their allies, which included H. L. Hunt and, presumably, Willoughby. This will take us from activities in Miami which involved gun-running and boat raids against the Cuban mainland; to Dallas, involving theft of arms from the Army for delivery to anti-Castro Cubans, linked to Jack Ruby and Oswald."},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"...for some years the control of Washington was consolidated in the sexual and other blackmail deposited in Hoover’s personal files. Peter Dale Scott, Deep Politics and the Death of JFK 26 GUN RUNNING IN D ALLAS We shall now examine recent developments in one more body of evidence placing right-wing extremists in Dallas and radical anti-Castro Cubans in the fringes of the John Kennedy assassination: a story of gun running in Dallas involving a then right-wing gunsmith by the name of John Thomas Masen, and others, including Jack Ruby, procuring weapons from the Army’s Fort Hood for selling to Cuban exiles. This appears to have been part of a program sponsored as a policy of the U.S. government through the CIA, in cooperation with anti-Castro Cubans, and involving the Minutemen in their combined efforts to unseat Fidel Castro. This will include a discussion of an Oswald “look-alike” in Dallas who might have—wittingly or unwittingly—been John Thomas Masen. The evidence promises to fill some of the blank spaces in the puzzle. John Thomas Masen was a weapons dealer and operated a gun shop in Dallas in 1963. What makes his story important is, first, there is no question that he furnished illegal weapons to the CIA-financed DRE/Alpha 66/SNFE in Dallas through Manuel Rodriguez Orcarberro, who was violently anti-Kennedy and leader of that anti-Castro group. Second, he may have been the “Oswald” seen at the anti-Castro Cuban safehouse on Harlendale Street in Dallas. Third, there is new evidence suggesting that he was involved with Jack Ruby in the above-mentioned gun-running activity in Dallas in November 1963 just before the assassination. Moreover, ATF undercover agent Frank Ellsworth suspected that Masen was a member of the Minutemen and associated with General Edwin Walker, providing one more link to the Dallas right wing in the plot. Masen was one of only two dealers in Dallas selling 6.5mm Mannlicher-Carcano ammunition, the type used in the alleged Oswald rifle, and he may have been the “Oswald” who was shooting at the rifle range in Dallas. In addition, he conceivably could have been the “Oswald” who visited Silvia Odio in late September 1963 and the “Oswald” who met with David Atlee Phillips (a.k.a. Maurice Bishop) and Antonio Veciana in Dallas in early September 1963. Of all the evidence suppressed by the federal government in the John Kennedy assassination, the evidence of Masen stands out as one of the most egregious examples. There were at least fifty major documents on Masen that were not released until 1993. In addition, a large number of critical documents have not been released as of this writing. The evidence shows that a massive investigation was made of Masen but virtually nothing of importance was revealed in the Warren Commission Report or the HSCA Report. An FBI document quoting Army Captain George Nonte describes John Thomas Masen as “approximately twenty-three years of age, 5’ 5\" tall, 130 pounds, receding hairline, sandy hair, sallow complexion, prominent nose, slender build....” [445] A record of his fingerprinting on November 22, 1963, however, shows his height as 5’ 9 1 D2\" and his weight as 156 pounds. [446] Frank Ellsworth, agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), arrested Masen for selling illegal weapons on November 20, 1963. He knew Masen well, having been involved as an undercover agent in a planned major sting operation against Masen, who was trafficking in illegal, stolen weapons. Masen escaped the major sting that had been set for him, apparently due to FBI interference that blew the ATF operation. Ellsworth then arrested Masen on a minor charge; Masen was released on bail."},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"When Ellsworth was in the Dallas police station after Oswald’s arrest on November 22, he looked at Oswald and thought that he had just turned loose the man who had killed the president. Dick Russell interviewed Ellsworth on July 13, 1976. Russell recently made available his notes of that interview: [Ellsworth:]... “Now why has this never come out anywhere, I’ve often wondered. There was an individual in this town [John Thomas Masen] who was an absolute dead ringer for him (Oswald). I happened to arrest him personally very shortly before (the assassination) and then when I saw Oswald a few days later, I thought—that’s my neck. The guy was out on bond, and very closely connected with the extreme right. I’m sure some of these witnesses had seen this other individual. He still looks like him, though he’s gained about 30 pounds in weight. Exactly the same facial features, hair—they could’ve passed for each other.” Ellsworth’s words leave me [Russell] stunned. I ask what he was arrested for: “Violation of the National Firearms Act. Machine guns. We had reason to believe he was with the Minutemen. “99% of the people we did investigate had no significant political connection,” he adds as an inside. “The reason I make a point is that some individuals have accused the ATF of witch-hunting....” I bring the subject back to this “second Oswald”—[Ellsworth said] “I personally talked to some individuals who thought they saw Oswald, subsequently saw this guy and said—that’s him. As close as you and I are sitting, he would seem identical twins. Identical build, weight, coloring, facial features, hair. “I’d have been hard pressed to tell ’em apart. My immediate reaction with Oswald was, that’s who he was and the first time I saw Oswald was from here to the door. All I could see was headlines I’d turned this man loose and several days later he killed the president....” I [Russell] mention a rifle range, whether the look-alike might’ve been the one identified as Oswald there. “I don’t know whether he was or not. I remember two instances in which he (Oswald) was at someone’s house in North Dallas, that I was able to ascertain the look-alike was at. If not the night before, the night following. I was working undercover on him at the time. He thought I was a crook. I’d read in the paper or somebody would say, he (Oswald) had been in X’s house on X night. And I’d find the look-alike knew these people and had been there at that approximate time. I was not keeping notes where the look- alike was minute by minute. There were two instances where witnesses saw him in the company of several other Minutemen. One of these deals did involve a group of Minutemen at a rifle range, I remember, and he knew all these people. Several of the names came up in my conversations with him. I noted it at the time that he was out shooting with them. He claimed to have done some smuggling in and out of Mexico, but not when I was dealing with him.... [447] (Emphasis added) Of particular interest is an FBI document dated April 1, 1964 which quotes Masen as stating that he visited Mexico extensively in the summer of 1963: Mr. Masen stated that during the summer of 1963 he made extensive vacation trips to Mexico, visiting friends in various places....” [448] Masen also stated that he frequently used the Trinity river bottom to test-fire rifles. From this we might infer that it is possible that he was the “Oswald” whom witnesses saw there: Mr. Masen stated people in the gun repair business in the vicinity of Love Field, Dallas, normally use the Trinity river bottom as a place to test fire rifles. He advised the river levee is sufficiently high to provide ample safety. Mr. Masen stated he frequently used the Trinity river bottom to test fire guns. He described this place as being approximately two miles west of his gun"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"shop. This area was checked and no cartridge cases or live ammunition was found. [449] Masen, in 1996 fifty-six years old, operates a gun parts manufacturing business in Dallas, Texas. By many measures, he appears to have been an important figure in the fringes of the Kennedy assassination, but not necessarily involved in the plot. A strange thing about Masen is that despite his having been arrested, apparently three times between November 20 and November 22, 1963 (according to the records—and arrested at least once, apparently concerning the JFK assassination), no photographs have been found of him in the public records circa 1963. His fingerprints were taken and a large amount of information developed about him, but no photographs. According to Carol Hewett, criminal attorney and JFK assassination researcher in Florida, this is virtually unheard of. Hewett and Anna Marie worked together in research on Masen over a period of two years (1994 to 1996) and obtained virtually every available document concerning his arrest and trials, but nowhere did they find a photograph of Masen. The only photograph they could find was in his high school yearbook, which showed some resemblance to Oswald. What is needed is a photograph circa 1963 to make a comparison with the real Oswald. In Frank Ellsworth’s investigation of Masen for firearms violations, he learned that Masen was involved in a large-scale operation stealing weapons by the truckload from the Army at Fort Hood in San Antonio; this was done with the cooperation of Captain George Nonte, the chief ordnance officer in charge of the Ford Hood arsenal. Ellsworth told Dick Russell: ...I was dealing with Masen largely from the standpoint they were about to carry off Fort Hood by the back gate. He was my contact with gun stealing Ford Hood blind. We were not able to make a criminal case. We think he got away with a medium tank supposed to have gone to the Minutemen. But this was an outhouse rumor. He was hauling out the back on a big flatbed truck. They were losing M-16s by the hundreds. The FBI and Army CID were going up the wall. Through Masen, I got an introduction there. But some things that happened scared the wits out of these people and brought the whole thing to a halt. A series of events. They were always jumpy. They slammed the door shut and went underground. [450] Masen was subsequently charged and convicted with some violations stemming from this violation. My main interest was as a means of getting in deeper. [451] (Emphasis added) An FBI document dated November 26, 1963 confirms that Captain Nonte was “possibly involved” in selling “surplus” Army weapons parts: [ ] advised that he had determined that a Captain George C. Nonte, of Fort Hood, Texas, and a Ray McKnight, Property Disposal Officer at the Red River Arsenal, Texarkana, Texas, were possibly involved in selling Masen surplus Army weapon parts.... [ ] further advised that he has determined that Masen is apparently a member of the Minutemen organization, or is strongly sympathetic to this group, and is possibly selling firearms to members of the Minutemen, or a similar type organization. [452] But the FBI was aware of Captain Nonte before November 26, 1963. An FBI document dated October 28, 1963 reported the following: Army Intelligence, San Antonio, Texas, on 10/24/63 advised that subject, Dallas, Texas, sporting goods store operator, had asked Captain George Charles Nonte, Fort Hood, Texas, an acquaintance, if he knew anyone who might be interested in buying information concerning large-scale military operations in Caribbean. Subsequent meeting between subject and Nonte was arranged for evening"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"of 10/24/63. In view of possible espionage activity, San Antonio Office was telephonically instructed to closely follow and develop full details. On 10/25/63 Nonte, who is cooperating , [453] advised he met subject as scheduled. Subject briefly mentioned to Nonte that data pertaining to military operation in Caribbean was obtained from weapons buyer from University of Miami named Martinez, [454] who had recently been through Dallas seeking arms. Subject implied Martinez had previously been involved in attack on Cuba reportedly carried out by Alpha 66, anti-Castro organization. Subject did not know date operation would take place, but indicated it would be directed against Cuba by large rebel forces allegedly staging at unknown Caribbean bases. Subject asked Nonte if he knew anyone who would pay for such information implying considerable money could be made on stock market by person having such data. Nonte plans to recontact subject on 10/31/63 in effort to obtain additional data. Nonte characterized subject as opportunist who would avail himself of any opportunity to make money. We have no pertinent information concerning subject in our files.... ...Foregoing information appears to pertain to plan of anti-Castro exiles to attack Cuba from Caribbean area. Since crackdown by U.S. authorities on such raids from U.S., reports have been received indicating exiles are using Caribbean area for attacks on Cuba. With reference to indication a large-scale attack being planned, consideration was given to possibility this might be Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operation; however, CIA on 9/28/63 in discussing anti-Castro activities in Nicaragua, advised that it was not organizing any Cuban invasion forces. [455] (Emphasis added) George Nonte wrote books on guns and was considered worldwide to be an expert. [456] He once worked with Masen in attempting to obtain a permit to import a “fine deer rifle” from Russia, successfully used in international target shooting events. [457] To complete our groundwork evidence, Masen’s selling of weapons to the radical DRE and Alpha 66 was confirmed in a Secret Service document dated January 17, 1964: ....Agent Ellsworth states that during his association with Masen, Masen had mentioned [Manuel] Rodriguez [Orcarberro] as being a Cuban who was attempting to buy arms—machine guns, bazookas, and other heavy equipment—from Masen. Masen also mentioned a George F. Parrel, a Cuban National who was an associate of Rodriguez and who was also attempting to buy arms from him. Masen informed Agent Ellsworth, while Ellsworth was undercover, that Rodriguez and Parrel were leaders of the local organization of the Cuban Student Directorate (DRE); also, that they were members of the Segundo Frente del Escambray which is known in America as Alpha 66. Alpha 66 is known as an active commando type organization which has recently made raids on Cuba. Masen informed Ellsworth that Rodriguez and Parrel had made purchases from him; that they presently have a large cache of arms somewhere in Dallas; he did not know the location.... [458] We can now proceed with our analysis concerning Jack Ruby in a Dallas gun-running operation with John Thomas Masen, the DRE/Alpha 66, and, possibly, Lee Harvey Oswald. John Elrod, Jack Ruby, and Oswald "},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"John Elrod’s story, as carefully pieced together by Mary and Ray La Fontaine in their book Oswald Talked, is that Elrod was arrested at 2:45 p.m. on November 22, 1963 and placed in a cell in the Dallas city jail (either in the same cell as Oswald or directly adjoining) for a period of four hours following Elrod’s arrest. According to the La Fontaines’ analysis of the evidence, Oswald told Elrod that he had been in a motel a few days preceding with four other men, including Jack Ruby, during which money had changed hands for a gunrunning transaction. [459] What had precipitated Oswald’s remarks was that a man with a smashed face had been brought into the cell block by the Dallas police for Oswald to identify. The man with the smashed face was Laurence Reginald Miller, who had been arrested on the night of November 18, 1963, along with Donnell Darius Whitter, in a stakeout by the FBI and the Dallas police that was related to an illegal transfer of weapons stolen from the Texas National Guard armory in Terrell, twenty miles from Dallas. The Dallas police had pursued the receivers of the illegal weapons, Whitter and Miller, and, curiously, had let the purveyors of the weapon leave the scene unscathed. In a 60-mph chase through the streets of Dallas, the automobile driven by Whitter, with Miller as a passenger, crashed against a telephone pole and the two were arrested. The automobile was a 1962 Thunderbird. [460] Whitter was taken to the Dallas Parkland Hospital where he was treated for severe abdominal injuries, remaining there for five days when he was brought to the Dallas City jail. But Miller, the one with the smashed face, although taken to Parkland Hospital for superficial treatment, was released the same day and sent to the Dallas city jail. [461] The Dallas police apparently had some reason to suspect a connection between the man in Elrod’s cell block and Miller. They brought Miller into the corridor of the cell block to see if Oswald could identify him. Elrod was retained in the Dallas jail over the weekend, put in lineups related to the JFK assassination, and then released after Jack Ruby shot Oswald. After Elrod’s release, he told his relatives and ex-employer that he knew that Oswald didn’t shoot Kennedy. He then left town in a hurry. [462] About eight months later, Elrod walked into a police station in Memphis, Tennessee, and told the officer there that he had information concerning Lee Harvey Oswald. [463] The Memphis police called the local FBI, which questioned Elrod. The FBI dismissed Elrod’s statement—that he had been incarcerated in the Dallas City jail—based on their curious claim that their search of Elrod’s records did not reveal such an arrest. There is no question, however, that there was such an arrest record which did not see the light of day until 1994 when it was obtained by Mary La Fontaine in a search of newly released Dallas police records. The arrest record clearly shows that Elrod was arrested on November 22, 1963 at 2:45 p.m. The fact that the FBI did not report Elrod’s arrest or his complete story is one more example of suppression of what appears to be extremely critical evidence that could have unraveled an important part of the JFK assassination mystery. The record absolutely should have been available to the FBI. Here are salient excerpts from the FBI report, which obviously attempts to minimize the importance of Elrod’s story: John Franklin Elrod, an inmate of the Shelby County, Tennessee, Jail, as of August 11, 1964, furnished the following information. Elrod currently lives at Memphis, Tennessee, and has been staying at the Harbor House....a home for alcoholics, and Elrod stated that he, himself, is an alcoholic. Elrod had come to the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office during the early morning hours of August 11, 1964, after having consumed some beer and vodka. He was at that time in possession of a sawed-off 12 gauge shotgun which had a pistol grip. He stated that he had begun to think of the"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"possibilities of killing his wife from whom he is now separated. Inasmuch as he had the sawed-off shotgun and the desire to kill her was known to him, he decided he should come to the Sheriff’s Office and talk, which he did. He further advised that he had been somewhat troubled by events which occurred immediately following the assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy at Dallas, Texas, on November 11, 1963. [sic] Shortly after the assassination of the President, Elrod, who had been about two and one half miles from the scene of the assassination at Lemon and Oaklawn Streets in Dallas, was arrested by the Dallas Police Department and placed in the City Jail. His arrest had nothing to do with the assassination of the President, and he knew nothing concerning the assassination of the President. At the City Jail in Dallas, he was placed in Cell 10 on the fifth floor, and at that time his cellmate was a man whose identity he could not recall. An individual, whose face was smashed up, was brought into the hallway of the jail where Elrod and his cellmate could observe him. At that time the unknown cellmate made some mention that he had known this man with the injured face as a result of meeting him at a motel. The cellmate stated that five men had met at a motel, and they had been advanced some money under some type contract. One of these men was reported to have received $5,000. The man with the injured face had received some money, and he was reported to have been driving a Thunderbird automobile with a large quantity of guns contained therein. Elrod advised he was confined in the Dallas City Jail for a period of 72 hours, and he was confused at this time concerning the events which occurred. He stated he could not recall whether Jack Ruby’s name had been mentioned prior to the time of the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald, but that this cellmate at some time had told him that one of the men who had been at the motel referred to above, name and location unknown, had been Jack Ruby. This was all the information which Elrod could recall. He stated that on several occasions he has had difficulty remembering due to his extreme use of alcohol. He knew nothing concerning the assassination of the President, the involvement of Jack Ruby in the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald, or of any information concerning the possibility of the receipt of money by Jack Ruby, except the hearsay information he had received from his unknown cellmate.... The identification record of John Franklin Elrod, FBI number 91 666 E, dated August 12, 1964, which follows, does not reflect incarceration of Elrod in the Dallas City Jail as claimed.... [464] (Emphasis added) What makes Elrod’s story ring authentic is that it is very unlikely that he would have known about the Thunderbird automobile and the meeting in the motel room with the five men including Jack Ruby, guns, and money changing hands. The information concerning the Thunderbird car had come out in a small article on page 19 of a Dallas newspaper while Elrod was in jail, and knowledge of gun running and Jack Ruby was not yet public. It seems reasonable to conclude that Elrod did, in fact, get this information from someone in the cell block with him and it could have been Oswald or an Oswald look-alike. The La Fontaine book was lauded in the assassination research community as a major breakthrough in the JFK assassination, although some of the authors’ broad conclusions were challenged. Their story that it was Oswald who had talked to Elrod in the four-hour period on November 22 was challenged by critics who allege that the person talking with Elrod was more likely to have been the Oswald look-alike, John Thomas Masen. But regardless of whether it was Oswald or Masen, the La Fontaine book has importance because it links Jack Ruby to a gunrunning ring in Dallas, and, through John Thomas Masen, links that operation to the Minutemen, the John Birch Society, General Edwin Walker, and H. L. Hunt. There are reasonable arguments that Elrod talked to Masen instead of Oswald. First, the taciturn"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"Oswald, who would not reveal anything to anyone when questioned by the police, would seem an unlikely candidate to be so forthcoming to an unknown inmate in the jail; furthermore, would Oswald mention Jack Ruby, thus risking incriminating himself in the gun-running operation? Second, Masen was arrested on November 22, 1963, according to fingerprint records and a Texas Department of Safety arrest record, and could well have been in the jail at the same time as Elrod. Inasmuch as it seemed likely that the controversy as to whether it was Masen or Oswald in the cell block could go on for an extended time, and with my publishing deadline approaching, I decided to confine myself to the broader aspects of the evidence on the logic that it must have been either Oswald or Masen. Using this premise, I would determine how it fitted in my quest for the identity of the people at the top of the conspiracy hierarchy. Carol Hewett, in an article refuting parts of Oswald Talked, wrote a paragraph that struck a chord with me: In the last analysis, it does not really matter whether it was Masen or Oswald who met with Jack Ruby days before the assassination, at least in so far as we are concerned about Ruby’s activities. Either way we now have independent evidence corroborating the much maligned Nancy Perrin Rich story that Ruby was running guns in 1961. And we have independent corroboration for the much ridiculed Marita Lorenz story that she (along with other individuals whose names crop up in assassination research) met with Jack Ruby the week of the assassination in a motel room loaded with weapons which had been stolen from military armories. Lorenz, Rich, and Elrod most definitely did not know one another and thus their statements, however farfetched they sound independently, now have the ring of truth when assembled together, and give us more insight into Jack Ruby than the Warren Commission ever did. [465] (Emphasis added) I have mentioned Marita Lorenz only briefly in a photo caption in Chapter 16. I had dismissed her story largely because I had yielded to peer pressure from respected researchers who scorned it. But now I thought perhaps, in my caution, I’d thrown out the baby with the bath water. Marita Lorenz was another CIA operative who told her story involving anti-Castro Cubans and CIA renegades in the plot to kill Kennedy. This now brings the number of CIA agents who revealed their stories, or parts of their stories, to five—not counting David Sanchez Morales. The Lorenz story, according to her sworn deposition in a lawsuit by E. Howard Hunt against a newspaper, The Spotlight, and its publisher, an organization named Liberty Lobby, Inc., is as follows: Marita Lorenz was recruited into the CIA by Frank Sturgis while she was Fidel Castro’s mistress in Havana. She left Cuba to participate in CIA activities in the United States and was brought into the lawsuit by Mark Lane for her extraordinary testimony. Lorenz claims that at one point she participated in a failed attempt to poison Castro that was sponsored by the CIA. The basis for the lawsuit was an article asserting that E. Howard Hunt may have been implicated in the assassination of President Kennedy. Published fifteen years after the murder of the president, it was written by a former CIA officer, Victor Marchetti. In December 1981, Hunt had won an initial judgment in the amount of $650,000, an award that would have forced Liberty Lobby into bankruptcy. Liberty Lobby retained attorney Mark Lane for the second trial. [466] In February 1985, the jury found Liberty Lobby not guilty of libel. In his book Plausible Denial, Mark Lane stated, “There is no legal precedent for Hunt v. Liberty Lobby. More than two decades after the murder of John F. Kennedy in Dallas, the case against his killers was finally tried in a civil action suit brought in the federal courthouse in Miami.” [467] A key witness was Marita Lorenz. Her testimony was taken in a January 11, 1985 deposition with Hunt’s legal counsel, Kevin A. Dunne, in attendance."},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"In 1993, I obtained a copy of Lorenz’s deposition from Miami researcher Gordon Winslow (actually two separate depositions; the second is a lawsuit by E. Howard Hunt against A. J. Weberman and Joseph Opaku’s publication, Third Press ), but I had filed them away because I had decided to abandon telling her story. In one fell swoop, Marita Lorenz’s testimony, [468] if we can believe it, establishes guilt of the CIA at a high level (E. Howard Hunt), and identifies a team of CIA operatives that traveled with Lorenz from Miami to Dallas in a caravan of two cars in late November 1963. According to Lorenz, the people traveling in the cars included Frank Sturgis, Gerald Patrick Hemming, two Cuban brothers named Novis, a pilot named Pedro Diaz Lanz, anti-Castro exile Orlando Bosch, and Lee Harvey Oswald. Lorenz was uncertain as to when the two cars left Miami. She testified in 1978 that it must have been on a weekend before the assassination. In 1985, she testified that it was on November 20, 1963. Lorenz identified E. Howard Hunt (a.k.a. “Eduardo”) as passing money to this group of people in a motel room in Dallas on November 21, and said that Jack Ruby visited the motel after E. Howard Hunt had left. Lorenz testified that she became concerned about the operation. She had Sturgis take her to the Dallas airport on November 21, and took a flight back to Miami. Lorenz testified that the caravan of cars was loaded with a trunk full of weapons, and that she later learned from Frank Sturgis that the trip’s purpose was to assassinate Kennedy; that Lorenz had missed out on the “big one.” Whether this was the actual team that assassinated Kennedy is not certain, but Lorenz has emphatically stated that she understood from Sturgis that they were involved in the operation. In addition to peer pressure, I had discarded Lorenz’s story partly because she swore that Lee Harvey Oswald was in the group in the second car that traveled to Dallas. Unless this was another Oswald look- alike, this could not be true because Oswald was working at the Texas Schoolbook Depository during the period in question. I attempted to contact Marita Lorenz through a friend who knew her family in Philadelphia, but to no avail, so I deleted Lorenz’s story from my manuscript except for the photo caption. Now I have reinserted it, although it still has some problems, such as Oswald being in the caravan as well as Gerald Patrick Hemming, who has denied it, and her vagueness as to the date of departure from Miami. It was at this point that Bob Dorff became very interested in the Masen/Elrod story and organized a small conference to be held in San Francisco on July 4-6, 1996. The agenda for the conference was a review of the La Fontaine book, primarily the part on John Elrod. Also included on the agenda was an update on the latest evidence about Oswald in Mexico City. Attendees were Bill Adams (the prime researcher for the La Fontaine book), veteran researchers and writers Paul Hoch and Peter Dale Scott, Mary Ferrell, Carol Hewett, Jim Lesar of the Assassination Archives, Bob Dorff, and myself. The San Francisco Conference Our discussion group met at the Golden Gate Holiday Inn on the evening of July 4, 1996. Marathon sessions continued until noon on July 6, with time out for sleep, food, and drinks, and for watching a spectacular display of fireworks from Mary Ferrell’s suite on the twenty-sixth floor of the hotel. As I anticipated, we were unable to reach a consensus on the viability of the evidence concerning whether it was Oswald or Masen who was in the cell block with Elrod. Carol Hewett presented her arguments and documents that the person could have been the Oswald look-alike Masen. Mary Ferrell presented Warren Commission documents showing that Oswald could not have been in the cell block at that time. Bill Adams argued his and the La Fontaines’ strong position that it was in fact Oswald in the cell block. However, there was no disagreement that the arrest of Whitter and Miller in the gun-running operation"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"was conclusively linked to the Oswald look-alike, John Thomas Masen. There was also no disagreement that the gun running from Fort Hood was to provide weapons for the DRE/Alpha 66 headquarters at the house on Harlendale Street in Dallas. (This activity linked back to a story in Chicago, including gun running for anti-Castro Cubans and Cuban exile Homer Eschevarria’s prediction of the JFK assassination, to be discussed in the following chapter). Being unable to tie down the John Elrod evidence connecting Oswald to the Whitter-Miller arrest and Jack Ruby to my satisfaction, I reaffirmed my decision not to place evidentiary credence on it in this book; not that the La Fontaines had failed to uncover important evidence, but that I did not have time and space to address the Oswald vs. Masen issue. It did seem to be essential, however, to address the issue of Jack Ruby’s gun running in Dallas and his connections to anti-Castro Cubans and John Thomas Masen. As Carol Hewett wrote, regardless of whether it was Masen or Oswald in the cell block with Elrod, there was a linkage of the arms trafficking to Jack Ruby. Summarizing: (a) The FBI report in Memphis has Elrod telling about Ruby in a motel room in Dallas with Miller and others, and money and guns changing hands. (b) The Nancy Perrin Rich story [469] in the Warren Commission documents about Ruby and gun running in Dallas, long ignored, now has credence. (c) The Marita Lorenz story, as fantastic as it sounds, is amazingly similar in detail to the Nancy Perrin Rich story and to the Elrod story—the same ingredients: meeting in a motel (or apartment, in Rich’s case), Ruby, guns, money—a few days before the Kennedy assassination. (d) Independent of the Elrod story, there was another possible link of Jack Ruby to the gun running of Whitter, Miller, and Masen. This was in a Dallas police report to Texas attorney general Waggoner Carr, which stated that Ruby’s car was routinely serviced at a Texaco station by none other than Donnell D. Whitter. [470] (e) The Whitter-Miller story parallels Ruby’s involvement in gun running with Thomas Eli Davis, whom the reader may recall was assisted by QJ/WIN to get out of jail in Algeria shortly after the Kennedy assassination when Davis was arrested with Oswald’s name in his possession. [471] (Recall that QJ/WIN was recruited by William Harvey and that David Sanchez Morales and Johnny Rosselli worked for Harvey in the ZR/RIFLE program to assassinate foreign leaders.) Additional evidence of Ruby’s deep involvement in gun running for the anti-Castro Cubans is in a tape of Gaeton Fonzi’s HSCA interview of Wally Weston. Weston was a nightclub comedian who worked for Jack Ruby in the Carousel Club. After Ruby was in jail for murdering Oswald, Weston visited him. Weston told Fonzi that Ruby said to him, “...gez, Wally, now they’re going to find out about Cuba, they’re going to find out about my trips to Cuba, they’re going to find out about the guns, find out about New Orleans, find out about everything.... ” [472] As a closing word on John Thomas Masen, I will quote Dick Russell’s interview of Masen in 1976— the only interview of Masen by a writer or researcher of which I am aware. Russell went to Masen’s gun shop in Dallas early one evening and dropped in unannounced. He found Masen working alone. Russell wrote: According to Ellsworth, the Oswald look-alike had put on about thirty pounds over the years. So, it seemed, had Masen. In 1976 he was a stocky, brown-haired thirty-six-year-old, about the same height as Oswald. The moment we shook hands, an uneasy feeling settled over me. If you looked closely, you could still see the resemblance. “If I saw a picture of Lee Harvey Oswald, I could probably pick it out,” Masen said, carefully smoothing some oil along the sight of a rifle. “But I can’t really visualize his face.” When I mentioned the name of Frank Ellsworth, Masen’s eyes flashed and his reply was acrid. “I got set up on that situation,” he said. “There was an agent from New Mexico who represented"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"himself as a buyer for the Cuban revolution against Castro. I sold him a couple automatic arms. They entrapped me into buying some parts. They finally dropped all charges except failure to keep proper records. I paid a $200 fine, but they took my firearms license away. And this has cost me an enormous amount of money, not being able to deal in firearms. I recently applied for a presidential pardon and was turned down.” Had he ever associated with the Minutemen? I asked. “I’d been to a couple parties. I knew some of the group. I realized they were gonna try to help take Cuba back and I was very sympathetic to the cause.” What about General Walker? “I met him back there. When things are unpleasant, you block them out. You try to forget. This has cost me $20,000 or $30,000 over the past twelve or thirteen years. I don’t know if I did any business with his people.” And H. L. Hunt? “Mr. Hunt was a fine man. One of my dear friends lived next door to them. But did I ever work for him? No. Did I ever receive money from him? No. Although I might have said I did at one time. You see, one of my dearest friends was in a sorority with a daughter. I met a good deal of the Hunts. I have some friends who were under the impression that the Hunts poured a lot of money into their coffers.” For a moment Masen paused. He gave me a long, probing look, as if he knew precisely what I was driving at. “Look, as I told them back then, if there was a Minutemen situation I’d been connected with, I couldn’t have told ’em anyway. My life wouldn’t be worth a penny. Realistically, that’s what it amounted to. “You know,” he went on, “I wouldn’t be in your shoes. Going around asking people about the Cubans, the Kennedy assassination. Why should people talk to you? There’s no way they can do anything but lose. One thing you should remember: What may be a living to you”—he paused, giving me another long look—“can be a life to them. “But if you want my opinion, to think the assassination was the act of one man, well, it’d be a very hard thing to do. I’ve got some friends who are top marksmen who say it couldn’t have happened like they said. I really don’t believe this was the brainstorm of one deranged man. I think it was the sophisticated work of someone with a great deal of money, who could buy a life. ” [473] (Emphasis added) Who could that person with a great deal of money be? H. L. Hunt, perhaps? Summary of Key Points of Chapter 26 - Jack Ruby was involved in gun running through anti-Castro Cuban extremists in Dallas who possessed foreknowledge of the Kennedy assassination. This implicates Ruby as being deeper into the plot than just a low-level hood who was ordered by the mob to kill Oswald. - These gun-running activities link Ruby to John Thomas Masen who was described by ATF agent Frank Ellsworth as a remarkable Oswald look-alike. Masen may have been the second Oswald seen around Dallas in the weeks preceding the Kennedy assassination, but there is no conclusive evidence that Masen consciously posed as Oswald; he may simply have been mistaken for Oswald. - The weapons for the gun-running operation through the anti-Castro Cubans were obtained in large part from U.S. Army’s Fort Hood in San Antonio, Texas. Headquarters for the 112th division of Army intelligence was also in San Antonio. As noted in Chapter 23, it was from this agency that the first"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"information was released that Oswald had the pseudonym Alex Hidell, suggesting further inquiry into how Army intelligence knew this and why they were so quick to release it to the public. - The evidence suggests that the Army was knowingly supplying the weapons as part of a CIA- sanctioned program through Captain George Nonte, an expert in guns and a colleague of John Thomas Masen. - The weapons were intended for some sort of second invasion of Cuba being promoted by Cuban exiles in the DRE and Alpha 66, and sponsored by the CIA. This may have been part of a larger post- missile crisis program involving killing Castro, possibly sponsored by the Kennedys. - The FBI thwarted the ATF operation to arrest John Thomas Masen in the gun-running operations, thus shutting it down and keeping the story underground. The FBI then systematically suppressed evidence of John Thomas Masen and the gun-running operations until it was finally revealed in documents released by the National Archives. This suggests that the gun-running operation could have been closely associated with the JFK assassination. All of this evidence dovetails, in the main, with what will be addressed in the next chapter: the stories of CIA operatives Richard Case Nagell, Robert Morrow, John Martino, and Colonel William Bishop. The common elements are Cuban exiles, the Mafia, the CIA, and right-wing extremists—both civilian and in the military."},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"It is impossible to keep an assassination plot a secret. James Hepburn, Farewell America (a book reportedly produced with the help of French intelligence) 27 CONVERGING LINES OF EVIDENCE In reviewing the material in the previous chapters, there are four repeating patterns of evidence that, over and over again, strongly define the broad structure of the execution phase of the plot to kill John F. Kennedy. This evidence involves: - The Mafia, including Jimmy Hoffa; - Right-wing extremists in the CIA and/or the military; - Extremists in the anti-Castro Cuban movement; and - Civilian right-wing extremists/racists. An important pattern that has emerged is the large number of people who had foreknowledge of the plot. Among these people, there seems to be a disproportionate number connected with anti-Castro Cuban groups or others linked closely to them. My objective in this chapter is to bring these disparate elements into a simplified account supported by the evidence. It was useful in previous chapters to focus on a single group of suspects and to explore their linkages with other suspects. By focusing on the anti-Castro Cubans and evidence of their foreknowledge of the assassination, I anticipate that a more definitive pattern will become apparent. As in the case of H. L. Hunt, everywhere we turn we see evidence of involvement of the anti-Castro Cubans, at least in the disinformation phase of the plot, and perhaps also in the execution phase. This chapter is long and detailed, and so is the chapter that follows on Gerald Patrick Hemming. But these two chapters are perhaps the most important insofar as revealing intricacies of the substructure of the plot, and thereby evidentiary linkages to the identities of the master plotters. In 1963, there was a bewildering array of anti-Castro Cuban organizations in the United States—more than one hundred of them. We will concentrate on a few of the more important ones where there is some known or suspected connection with the assassination. Examples of these groups are listed below: Key Anti-Castro Cuban Organizations [474] Group: Alpha 66—Segundo Frente Key Individuals: Sergio Arcacha-Smith; Antonio Veciana; del Escambray (SNFE) Rolando Masferrer; Tony Cuesta; Felipe Vidal Santiago; Manuel Rodriguez Orcarberro; Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo Group: SNFE-Alpha-66-MRP Key Individuals: Manuel Rodriguez Orcarberro Group: CRC — Cuban Revolutionary Council Key Individuals: Sergio Arcacha-Smith; Carlos Prio Socarras; Manuel Artime; Manuel Rodriguez (Orcarberro?); Manuel Gil; Luis Rabel; Arnesto Rodriguez, Sr.; Arnesto Rodriguez, Jr. Group: FRD — Frente Revolucionario Democratico (Cuban Revolutionary Front) Key Individuals: Sergio Arcacha-Smith; Dr. Jose Ignacio Rasco Bermuda Group: United Organization for the Liberation of Cuba Key Individuals: Mario Garcia Kohly; Eladio del Valle; Manuel Rodriguez (Orcarberro?) Group: 30th of November "},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"Key Individuals: Homer S. Echevarria; Rolando Masferrer; Carlos Rodriguez Quesada Group: JURE — Junta Revolucionaria Key Individuals: Rogelio Cisneros Diaz; Carlos Zarraga Martinez; Manuel Ray Rivero Group: JGCE — Junta del Gobierno de Cuba en el Exilio Key Individuals: Paulino Sierra Martinez Group: DRE — Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (Student Revolutionary Directorate) Key Individuals: Carlos Bringuier; Juan Manuel Salvat Roque; Juan Francisco Blanco- Fernandez; Manuel Rodriguez Orcarberro; Miguel Mariano Cruz; Guillermo Oton Group: MIRR — Movimiento Insurreccional de Recuperacion Revolucionaria Key Individuals: Orlando Bosch; Jose Antonio Gonzalez Lanusa; Israel Mesa Gonzales; Gervelio Gutierrez These groups overlapped and worked together, with participants shifting from one group to another, in their crusade against their common enemy, Fidel Castro. They probably all knew each other. At least five on the above list appear to have been deeply involved in the Kennedy assassination: Alpha 66, 30th of November, SNFE, the DRE, and the CRC. The head of the CRC, Sergio Arcacha-Smith, was known to have been a frequent visitor to the offices of H. L. Hunt in the months preceding the assassination. Arcacha’s office in New Orleans was located at 544 Camp Street, down the hall from Guy Banister’s headquarters which were frequented by Oswald. [475] One of the first indications we have of involvement of Cuban exiles in the assassination was noted in the HSCA Report. [476] An incident that the committee found particularly disturbing came to the attention of the Secret Service within days after John Kennedy’s death, prompting the agent in charge of the Chicago field office to write a memorandum about “a group in the Chicago area who may have a connection with the J.F.K. assassination.” The memorandum reported a tip from an informant that a Cuban activist, Homer S. Echevarria , in a discussion about an illegal arms sale, said that “his group had ‘plenty of money’ and that his backers would proceed [with the arms deal] ‘as soon as we take care of Kennedy.’” Echevarria was a member of the 30th of November group, which was dissolved shortly after the assassination. Another member of this same group was Rolando Masferrer, who was also a money conduit between Carlos Marcello and Alpha 66. Alpha 66, the radical exile group, had a house in Dallas at the time of the assassination. The Secret Service memorandum about Echevarria was sent to the FBI, but no action was taken. The FBI said it was “primarily a protection matter and that the continued investigation would be left to the U.S. Secret Service.” Shortly thereafter, Lyndon Johnson gave the FBI sole jurisdiction over the entire JFK investigation, and the FBI made it clear that it wanted the Secret Service to terminate its investigation. [477] Once again we have the FBI, under the control of LBJ, suppressing vital evidence, and the Secret Service complying. The HSCA found that the 30th of November group was backed financially by the JGCE, a Chicago- based organization run by Paulino Sierra Martinez that backed the more militant groups including Alpha 66 and the DRE, through which Carlos Bringuier was involved in the street scuffle with Oswald in New Orleans. The JGCE financial support allegedly came from individuals connected to organized crime; the"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"group was dissolved shortly after President Kennedy’s assassination. [478] A possible link between Alpha 66, DRE, and Oswald was reported in the Warren Commission Exhibits in an investigation report written by Dallas deputy sheriff Buddy Walthers to sheriff Bill Decker: 11-23-63 Mr. Decker About 8:00 am this morning, while in the presents [ sic ] of Allen Sweatt, I talked to Sorrels the head of the Dallas Secreat [ sic ] Service. I advised him that for the past few months at a house at 3128 Harlendale some Cubans had been having meetings on the week ends and were possably [ sic ] connected with the “Freedom For Cuba Party” of which Oswald was a member. 11-26-63 I don’t know what action the secreat [ sic ] service has taken but I learned today that sometime between seven days before the president was shot and the day after he was shot these Cubans moved from this house. My informant stated that subject Oswald had been to this house before. Buddy Walthers W.C. Vol. XIX, p. 534, Decker Exhibit 5323 This report clearly highlighted the possibility of a serious connection between Oswald and Cubans in Dallas shortly before the assassination. It suggested the possibility of a safe house in Dallas to accommodate assassins. Yet no action was taken by the Secret Service or the FBI. Later it would be revealed that the house on Harlendale Street was for the use of Alpha 66. Also, Manuel Rodriguez of the DRE was associated with this house. Rodriguez was a vociferous Kennedy hater. So here we have, surfacing within a few days after November 22, a network including militant Cubans and Mafiosi with connections to Lee Harvey Oswald, involvement in gun running to Cuba, and one of the Cubans bragging about “taking care of Kennedy” occurring just before the assassination took place. As we see, over and over, leads were there which could possibly have cracked the case wide open. But the FBI either consistently ignored or suppressed this evidence. Another example of foreknowledge of the assassination linked to Cuban exiles were the statements of Joseph Milteer which have been mentioned briefly in previous chapters. Milteer was a right-wing extremist active in supporting the Cuban exiles. The evidence has to do with a Miami police informant (William Somersett, known as informant 88), who notified the FBI that he had tape recorded a threat against Kennedy made by Joseph Milteer on November 9, 1963 in Miami. The threat said that Kennedy would be killed by a rifleman from a tall building, and that someone would be picked up within hours after the assassination to “throw the public off.” The recording of this conversation is a matter of available public record. [479] Following the assassination, Somersett again met with Milteer. Milteer commented that things had gone as he had predicted. Somersett asked if Milteer actually had known of the assassination before it occurred or if he had just been guessing. Milteer asserted that he had been certain beforehand about the inevitability of the assassination. [480] He said, “Everything ran true to form. I guess you thought I was kidding you when I said he would be killed from a window with a high-powered rifle....” Milteer added, “Not to worry about the capture of Oswald, ‘because he doesn’t know anything....The right-wing is in the clear...the patriots have outsmarted the communist group in order that the communists would carry out the plan without the right-wing becoming involved.’” [481] The FBI had received this information about Milteer but did not pass it on to the Warren Commission until two weeks before its work was to be concluded, which as a practical matter was too late for the commission to use it effectively and still meet its deadline for getting the finished report to Lyndon Johnson. Again, we have the FBI stalling and maneuvering to suppress evidence that it could not destroy"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"because the reporting entity was out of its control. (The FBI—to cover itself—did notify the Secret Service of Milteer’s statements prior to the assassination, but, incredibly, the Secret Service did not inform its Dallas agents of the threat, although other field offices were informed.) [482] It should be noted that Milteer was closely linked and very active with the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist hate groups, one of which included a man by the name of Jack Brown, a notoriously violent extremist who was suspected of being instrumental in the bombing of a Birmingham, Alabama, church in September 1963 in which four young black girls were killed. [483] Perhaps the most thoroughly documented evidence of foreknowledge of the assassination involving Cubans is the story of Rose Cheramie, [484] a heroin addict and prostitute who was found, bruised and disoriented, lying on the road near Eunice, Louisiana, on November 20, 1963. Cheramie was taken to Louisiana State Hospital in Jackson, Louisiana. She told the attending physician that Kennedy was going to be killed during his forthcoming trip to Dallas. Rose Cheramie’s story was thoroughly investigated by the HSCA. Aspects of her story were verified by Dr. Victor Weiss, who was employed as a resident physician at the hospital in 1963. The HSCA reported: Dr. Victor Weiss...recalled that on Monday, November 25, 1963, he was asked by another physician, Dr. Bowers, to see a patient who had been committed November 20 or 21. Dr. Bowers allegedly told Weiss that the patient, Rose Cheramie, had stated before the assassination that President Kennedy was going to be killed. Weiss questioned Cheramie about her statements. She told him she had worked for Jack Ruby. She did not have any specific details of a particular assassination plot against Kennedy, but had stated the “word in the underworld” was that Kennedy would be assassinated . She further stated that she had been traveling from Florida to her home in Texas when the man traveling with her threw her from the automobile in which they were riding. HSCA, Vol. X, pp. 200-201 (Emphasis added) The HSCA found further verification of Cheramie’s story from Francis Fruge, a lieutenant with the Louisiana state police; he was the police officer who first came to Cheramie’s assistance and took her to the hospital. During the one- or two-hour ride to the hospital, Fruge asked Cheramie routine questions. Fruge told the HSCA that Cheramie had related that she was coming from Florida to Dallas with two men who were “Italians or resembled Italians”: ...They had stopped at this lounge...and they’d had a few drinks and had gotten into an argument or something. The manager of the lounge threw her out and she got on the road and hitchhiked to catch a ride, and this is when she got hit by a vehicle.... Fruge said the lounge was a house of prostitution called the Silver Slipper. Fruge asked Cheramie what she was going to do in Dallas: “She said she was going to, number one, pick up some money, pick up her baby, and to kill Kennedy.” Fruge claimed during these intervals that Cheramie related the story she appeared to be quite lucid. Fruge had Cheramie admitted to the hospital late on November 20. On November 22, when he heard the President had been assassinated, Fruge said he immediately called the hospital and told them not to release Cheramie until he had spoken to her. The hospital administrators assented but said Fruge would have to wait until the following Monday before Cheramie would be well enough to speak to anyone. Fruge waited. Under questioning, Cheramie told Fruge that the two men traveling with her from Miami were going to Dallas to kill the President. For her part, Cheramie was to obtain $8,000 from an unidentified source in Dallas and proceed to"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"Houston with the two men to complete a drug deal.... During the course of the New Orleans D.A.’s investigation Fruge was able to pursue leads in the Cheramie case that he had not checked out in the original investigation....Fruge spoke with the owner of the Silver Slipper Lounge. The bar owner, a Mr. Mac Manual since deceased, told Fruge that Cheramie had come in with two men who the owner knew as pimps engaged in the business of hauling prostitutes in from Florida. When Cheramie became intoxicated and rowdy, one of the men “slapped her around” and threw her outside. Fruge...showed the owner of the bar a “stack” of photographs and mug shots to identify.... the bar owner chose the photos of a Cuban exile, Sergio Arcacha Smith, and another Cuban Fruge believed to be named Osanto.... HSCA, Vol. X, pp. 201-202 With the examples of evidence just cited, it does not seem that we need to go further to reach a firm conclusion that anti-Castro Cubans were indeed involved in the Kennedy assassination. A question that remains: Were they prime players? As we have seen, Sergio Arcacha Smith, Alpha 66, and DRE were financed by H. L. Hunt and the CIA. But were they just one more layer of false sponsors to shield the big fish? We shall now examine several lines of inquiry involving the anti-Castro Cubans to see if they converge into a common, plausible theory that is compatible with the previously discussed evidence concerning the French Connection, Mexico City, the Mafia, and the forensic evidence: 1. First we shall examine the story of Richard Case Nagell, who was assigned by the CIA to infiltrate and investigate Cuban exile groups that the CIA suspected were getting out of control, perhaps plotting to assassinate the president. Nagell was also assigned the mission of investigating Oswald, and journeyed to Mexico City where he says he met Oswald in 1963. Moreover, Nagell revealed that he was a double agent between the CIA and Soviet intelligence and was ordered by the Soviets to murder Oswald to prevent Oswald from participating in the assassination of Kennedy. Nagell, while under arrest in El Paso, Texas, predicted the assassination of Kennedy. 2. The story of Robert Morrow, who claims that he knew about Richard Case Nagell’s assignment by the CIA, and who was given the assignment to purchase four Mannlicher-Carcano rifles along with walkie-talkies for delivery to David Ferrie in 1963—all of which, or their equivalent, showed up at Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963. Morrow also claims that he knew Cuban exile Eladio del Valle, who told Morrow in advance that Kennedy was going to be assassinated. This added one more member to the list of people who had advance knowledge of the assassination. 3. Information concerning anti-Castro Cuban involvement in the assassination was provided at the Nassau conference that I attended in December 1995. During this conference, the Cubans flatly declared that Eladio del Valle was involved in the Kennedy assassination. They also revealed very important new information concerning Colonel William Bishop, a CIA hit man (who has confirmed parts of Nagell’s story), and Colonel Bishop’s linkages to Cuban exiles and wealthy Dallas businessmen such as H. L. Hunt. (The Cubans stated that they had intelligence agents in all of the anti-Castro groups operating out of Florida and elsewhere in the United States.) 4. The story of John Martino, who revealed before he died that he was involved with Cuban exiles in the Kennedy assassination plot. Martino was a Mafia and CIA-linked operative in anti- Castro activities. This section will include a discussion of the activities of William Pawley, Henry Luce, and Clare Boothe Luce in promoting privately financed, covert operations against Cuba. These associations could prove to be important linkages between Pawley and General Charles Willoughby and other right-wing extremist elements. (The reader will recall that individuals at Life magazine"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"appeared to have been involved, or at least knew of, the forgery of the Zapruder film.) By examining these lines of evidence separately and then consolidating them, a more coherent picture perhaps will emerge—not only of the Cuban exiles but a much larger view of the master plot. We begin with the story of Richard Case Nagell. These accounts, by necessity, will be greatly condensed and simplified. A method that will be used is to look for corroboration of the truthfulness in the attestations of Nagell, Morrow, Bishop, and Martino. They all claimed to have been involved in the fringes of the JFK assassination, but not in the plot itself. If we can believe their individual statements in the main, then their combined accounts become invaluable, particularly their versions of the composition of a master plot. Richard Case Nagell: Double Agent A major source for my work on Nagell was discussions with Dick Russell and information from Russell’s book The Man Who Knew Too Much . Russell is by far the most authoritative source concerning Nagell. In addition, I commissioned Anna Marie Kuhns-Walko to search the National Archives for any further material. She found a considerable number of documents on Nagell. Finally, I was fortunate to contact Nagell personally and engage him in telephone conversations and correspondence about himself and the Kennedy assassination. I was the first writer in many years to do so —a few months before he died suddenly in October 1995, alone in his tiny apartment in Los Angeles, just as a letter was in the mail subpoenaing him to appear before the Assassination Records Review Board. At the time of his death, Nagell was sixty-five years old and a broken man. Only six weeks earlier, he had told me that he feared for his life. (The Los Angeles coroner’s office told me that the cause of death was diagnosed as arteriosclerotic heart disease.) After Nagell’s death, I was contacted by one of his relatives, the executor of his estate, who had found my letters in Nagell’s footlocker. Nagell had talked with his estate executor about me shortly before he died. The executor provided me with additional information of considerable interest. Much of the material in this chapter was written before Nagell’s death and was reviewed by him. I have noted his direct comments and corrections. Richard Case Nagell is considered by many to be the most important witness in the JFK assassination, and, for reasons that follow, I am inclined to agree. On September 20, 1963, Nagell, then thirty-three years old, was arrested in El Paso, Texas, for firing two harmless shots into the ceiling of the State National Bank. Nagell would later claim that prior to this incident he had sent a warning letter to J. Edgar Hoover and to the CIA in which he had revealed a conspiracy to assassinate John Kennedy that he believed would take place in late September 1963. He claimed that his letter provided information on Oswald and two of his associates, Angel and Leopoldo. (The reader will recall that these were the two Cubans who, along with Oswald, visited Silvia Odio in Dallas in September 1963.) After his arrest, and before November 22, Nagell told policeman Jim Bundren in El Paso that something was going to happen in Dallas . In an interview with Dick Russell, Jim Bundren recounted his conversation with Nagell: “I said, ‘You really didn’t want to rob that bank, did you?’ “He just looked at me for a minute. He’s got that look that’s unusual, the penetrating eyes, that scar down one side of his face. And he said, ‘What makes you say that?’ “I said, ‘I saw the shots you fired in the bank. With your Army training and everything, I just felt like maybe it was some kind of a diversionary tactic.’"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"“Nagell just smiled and said, ‘Well, I’m glad you caught me. I really don’t want to be in Dallas.’ “I said, ‘What do you mean by that?’ “‘You’ll see soon enough,’ he said.” [485] The shooting incident in the El Paso bank was the culmination of Nagell’s career in Army intelligence and later with the CIA. It is a complex tale of a tragic spy who tried to come in from the cold. As punishment for shooting two harmless shots into the ceiling of a bank and then waiting outside to be arrested, Nagell was sentenced to ten years in the federal penitentiary. The federal judge assigned to the case was Homer Thornberry, Lyndon Johnson’s personal friend, whom he had just appointed. Transcripts of Johnson’s telephone conversations immediately after the assassination reveal that Thornberry was one of the first persons Johnson contacted. This is a strong indication that powers in government were aware of Nagell’s importance, and extraordinary measures were necessary to silence him. Aside from this remarkable confirmation of Nagell’s story by a respected police officer in El Paso, there are several other substantial reasons to believe Nagell. First, he was indeed a contract agent for the CIA and was given the assignment of investigating Oswald in 1963. This was corroborated in an official document from Nagell’s military intelligence file dated May 2, 1969: From 14 December 1959 through 22 June 1962, subject was employed as a special investigator for the State of California, Fraud Section, Department of Employment, and the Department of Alcoholic Control. On 8 June 1962, subject was suspended for unauthorized release of information to the newspapers and the Los Angeles Police Department. During the period from August 1962 to October 1963 subject was intermittently employed as an informant and/or investigator for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). In April 1963, subject conducted an inquiry concerning the marital status of Marina Oswald and her reported desire to return to the USSR. During July, August, September, and on one occasion prior to this, subject conducted an inquiry into the activities of Lee Harvey Oswald , and the allegation that he had established a Fair Play For Cuba Committee in New Orleans, Louisiana. Subject stated that while working for the CIA, he had operated in Mexico, Florida, Louisiana, Texas, California, Puerto Rico, and New York. He was primarily concerned with investigating activities of Anti-Castro organizations and their personnel in the United States and Mexico.... [486] (Emphasis added) So here we have credible eye/ear-witness testimony and a government document substantiating that Nagell was a CIA contract agent, that he had predicted the Kennedy assassination in Dallas three months before it happened, and that he had been assigned by the CIA in 1963 to investigate Oswald and right- wing anti-Castro Cuban organizations (despite CIA statements professing that it had no interest in Oswald). Of special significance is that the above document does not state that Nagell claimed these facts. On the contrary, it states them as facts and does not dispute them. It clearly delineates what Nagell said from what is stated as fact. It was at this point that I sent a letter to Dick Russell, asking him if he would prepare a list of reasons why I should believe Nagell’s story. Here is the reply I received from Russell on December 23, 1993: ....there is plenty more that adds credence to Nagell’s account, as far as he has chosen to reveal it. You asked me to name some of the key items. Off the top of my head, here goes: - Why did the Secret Service spend two hours questioning Marina Oswald about Nagell, if he was unimportant? - Why did the Warren Commission totally ignore Nagell even in the 28 volumes, despite FBI files which state he knew Oswald and despite his April 1984 letter to J. Lee Rankin (Warren"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"Commission chief counsel) about the letter he sent Hoover? - Why did LBJ friend Judge Homer Thornberry suddenly enter the Nagell bank case in January 1964, only a month after he convinced LBJ to set up a Warren Commission and take the inquiry out of Texas? (See Newsweek ’s special issue.) - Would El Paso cop Jim Bundren make up a tale of how Nagell stated he “wouldn’t want to be in Dallas right now”—three weeks before the assassination? - Why the curious parallels between the notebooks of Lee Oswald and Richard Nagell? - Why do more and more of Nagell’s “revelations” continue to be borne out by the newly released documents on Mexico City, the recent interest in Desmond - Why is Nagell investigating Vaughn Marlowe of the LA Fair Play for Cuba Committee? To name a few [reasons]... I will address the significance of some of these items as this chapter progresses. But before going further, we need some background on Nagell. Richard Case Nagell was born on August 5, 1930 in Greenwich Village, New York. He enlisted in the Army in 1948 on his eighteenth birthday and was assigned to paratrooper school at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Shortly after that, at the age of nineteen, he went into Army intelligence at a beginning level. He studied Russian at Fort Bragg and took an extension course in Mandarin Chinese. In the fall of 1951, Nagell was shipped to Korea to serve in the Korean War where he was assigned as a rifle platoon leader. He had the reputation of being a top-notch lieutenant who commanded forty men in his platoon. Nagell “did not know what fear was.” He “would jump into the goddamned trench holes and you’d see Chinese coming out of there.” He was wounded several times. Even after being wounded he requested reassignment to Korea and was sent back to active combat where he was again wounded and again returned to the front lines after five days in the hospital. Nagell described himself as a young idealist who went to Korea voluntarily. He was an anti- Communist and “a fervent defender of the faith (fear) of the spread of communism.” Nagell was the youngest American to receive a battlefield commission to captain during the course of the war. When the war ended in 1953, he was just nine days short of his twenty-third birthday. Nagell was the recipient of three Purple Hearts, a Bronze Star, the Korean Service Medal, and the U.N. Service Ribbon. He had seen action on about 175 battle patrols."},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":" Richard Case Nagell (right), handcuffed and being led into federal custody in El Paso after being arrested outside the State National Bank.

During this period he suffered injuries in a military plane crash near Andrews Air Force Base in Washington, D.C., on November 28, 1954. He was the only soldier of five to live through the ordeal; he survived by parachuting from the plane. He suffered a severe concussion and was unconscious for twenty-seven days after the crash. When he was discharged from the Army’s Walter Reed Hospital, he was given a thorough psychiatric examination which cleared him of any obvious personality changes related to his injuries. Despite Nagell’s clean bill of health, the FBI, the CIA, and others would later use the fact of his injuries in the plane crash to trash his entire story. While still hospitalized, Nagell was assigned to duty with the Army’s Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) school at Fort Holabird, Maryland, and in May 1955 he reported to duty at the CIC’s intelligence training center. Nagell graduated with honors; on August 12, 1955 he was designated a counter- intelligence officer. In September 1955 he was granted a top-secret security clearance and was assigned to CIC duty in Los Angeles. It was of this experience that Nagell recounted, “we opened the mail of civilians with a postal inspector standing right next to us. The CIC and FBI stole the files of the local Communist party chapter, just took the whole file cabinet out of their office.” On May 5, 1956, he was notified that he was being reassigned to Army intelligence in the Far East, to the highly secret Field Operations Intelligence (FOI). This assignment was under the command of General Charles Willoughby, who would later become associated with H. L. Hunt and involved in ultra-right-wing, anti-Communist/white supremacist organizations worldwide. The FOI was a top-secret division considered sacrosanct by military intelligence. In function, FOI was an extension of CIA special operations. It was in effect an activity “designed to conceal the true nature of CIA objectives.” (FOI operations included the notorious Berlin tunnel project, headed by William Harvey. As we have seen, Harvey is one of the suspects in the JFK assassination who could have been the mastermind of the plan.) Nagell wrote about his indoctrination in the FOI concerning the various tools of the trade. He wrote about simple and intricate weapons to be used in assassinations: undetectable poisons, disguises, miniature wire recorders, tape recorders, and cameras concealed in innocuous-appearing objects. These devices also included miniature cameras (remember Oswald’s miniature camera), radio transmitters and receivers, code books, etc. It also included an assassination device, a short metal tube, which Nagell was told he might come across in his work. (Recall the tubular poison gas weapon described in Chapter 25 that was an object of fascination for Nelson Bunker Hunt.) This sophistication in assassinations had begun to reach its mature form in the late 1950s. At that point, it seems clear that the CIA and military intelligence were heavily involved in the “pure science” of assassinations mentioned by James Jesus Angleton, head of CIA’s counter intelligence, to Dick Russell. Concerning his FOI operations in the Republic of Korea and his services with the FOI and CIC in Japan, Nagell wrote: “The FOI sponsored, financed, supported or otherwise participated in assassinations, kidnapping, blackmailing, and a host of other illicit practices in violation of U.S. federal statutes, the uniform code of military justice, international law and U.S. treaty obligations.” These included, according to Nagell, FOI support for a plan to assassinate the Republic of Korea’s President Syngman Rhee in the fall of 1956, “an operation that was aborted, allegedly on FOI insistence, when it was ascertained that too many Americans, including the U.S. Army Brigadier General, might be killed in the process.” In the autumn of 1957 Nagell was given a new assignment in the Japanese capital, after he had expressed moral and ethical dissatisfaction with the operations of Team 26. Nagell had complained that in the course of his FOI duties he had participated in practically every major crime."},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"Nagell’s duties during his Tokyo assignment included a full-time period in the CIC file depository in Japan to “supervise the review regarding of security classification and destruction of thousands of secret and top secret documents accumulated by the CIC during the years 1945-57.” It was on this assignment that Nagell would become privy to a vast amount of sensitive information, much of which he would copy for safekeeping to protect himself later if the need should arise. And it was during this phase of his spy career that Nagell learned of the name Joseph Kramer, which he would use later in connection with the JFK assassination. In his September 1963 letter to the FBI in which he disclosed the plans for the Kennedy assassination, Nagell signed it with the name Joseph Kramer, a pseudonym for Mark Julius Gayn, a known Communist who had penetrated several military intelligence organizations in the Far East shortly after World War II. Nagell said he did this “because he felt sure that if the FBI got a letter signed ‘Joseph Kramer’ and ran a file check on the computer, they would look into it. They would know that this is not a crank letter.” In 1957, a curious parallel path between Nagell and Oswald began to become apparent. Nagell was recruited in Tokyo by the CIA (this was also suspected of Oswald). Nagell’s assignment was to assist in the defection of Soviet Colonel Nikolai Eroshkin from the Soviet embassy; Eroshkin was suspected of being among the top of Soviet military intelligence (GRU) in Japan. This parallels what some researchers believe was the assignment of Oswald when he defected to Russia—to assist in the defection of another Soviet intelligence colonel who was an uncle of Marina Oswald. Sometime in late 1957 or early 1958, Nagell and Oswald met in Tokyo with Dr. Chikao Fujisawa, a professor at Tokyo University whom Nagell had enlisted in his project assignment. Fujisawa had been a propagandist for the Japanese during World War II and was acquainted with the alleged Soviet spy Mark Gayn. (Later, in 1959 in New York City, Fujisawa attempted to recruit Nagell to work for Soviet intelligence.) Fujisawa also may have attempted to recruit Oswald in Japan, thus launching Oswald’s career as a spy. It was during this period in Japan that both Nagell and Oswald had girlfriends at the expensive nightclub in Tokyo, The Queen Bee, where Oswald was passing along fake information to a KGB contact. Other parallels between Nagell and Oswald would continue to emerge over the years: [487] Nagell married a Japanese woman; Oswald later had an affair in Dallas with a Japanese woman. Both used the alias Hidell/Hidel. Both had connections with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in the United States. Both owned miniature cameras generally available only to spies. Both visited Mexico City at the same time in 1963. Both purportedly attempted to renounce their U.S. citizenship in what seem to be staged events. Both attempted to reinstate their military discharges and were turned down on the same day. Both were FBI informants. Both were probably double agents (Nagell for sure and Oswald is suspected). Nagell, like Oswald, may have been targeted as a patsy in the JFK assassination. In each of their military careers there was a strange pattern of insubordination and troublemaking in what appear to have been staged episodes to create their bonafides as defectors, while at the same time their dossiers showed excellent performance records. Both had backgrounds from broken homes with absentee fathers. Both had a trail of supposed pro-Communist leanings which fit into a defector image. Both supposedly had histories of mental instabilities—fitting into an assassin profile. (In 1958 and 1959, as Nagell and Oswald were embarking on their spy careers, there was a rash of defections to the Soviet Union by young, disaffected U.S. servicemen.) In 1959 Nagell returned to the United States, ostensibly left the service, and went to work for the California Division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Taxes, later to become the ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms). But, strangely, Nagell continued to use his Japanese language expertise by acting as an interpreter for Japanese dignitaries when they visited the U.S. Dick Russell believes that Nagell belonged to his “past spy agencies.” This may have been just a waiting period for Nagell before being"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"used on his next assignment. It was at this juncture in my writing (while I was away on an interview trip) that Nagell died, much to my shock and dismay. I learned that before his death he told a relative (who later became the executor of his estate) that he had decided he was going to work with me, that he had “finally found someone he could trust to tell his complete story.” I lamented that if only I had acted sooner to meet with Nagell, or had followed up more aggressively, I would have learned much more. But let us continue with Nagell’s story. Nagell’s specific involvement in the Kennedy assassination apparently began with his assignment to penetrate the Cuban exile group Alpha 66 and to investigate Oswald. It has been postulated by Dick Russell that Nagell himself became an alternate patsy to Oswald for the Kennedy assassination. I will not attempt to evaluate that subject. Rather, I will focus on Nagell’s version of the assassination plot and see how it compares to versions of the plot recounted by other CIA agents. It is important to note that Nagell was probably involved in only one of the compartmentalized phases of the plot and, therefore, would not have known the complete story; so what he has told could be in part from first-hand experience, and in part his own theory of the assassination that he developed over the years. In a nutshell, Nagell claimed that the plot was a “domestic inspired, domestic-formulated, domestic conspiracy” to assassinate the president. He said that the CIA-mob plots to assassinate Fidel Castro had some connection to what happened to Kennedy, “but to assume that the KGB or the CIA or the Mafia did it was a bunch of crap.” Nagell also claimed that the CIA had “absolutely nothing to do with the assassination,” which “is not to say that some of their ex-employees were not involved.” This could be a very significant statement and evidence of what many have long believed—that the CIA, as an organization, was not involved in the Kennedy assassination except in the cover-up. [488] What is important is that Nagell emphatically stated that the FBI had a major role in the assassination. He also said that Communist powers inside or outside the United States were not involved. Nagell said that Oswald was part of the conspiracy and could have fired a rifle [489] from the School Book Depository Building—as a decoy. He said that Lee Harvey Oswald was “in it up to his ears,” and that the reason Garrison and assassination buffs had “not wanted him [Nagell] in” was because he would not go along their idea of Oswald’s innocence. [490] Nagell wrote that a group in Mexico City, which he called Bravo (thought by researchers to have been an affiliate of Alpha 66), was involved in the plot. [491] Nagell claimed that top CIA officials knew what had happened, as well as the FBI. He said that the lower Soviet intelligence also knew about it, but for some reason did not communicate it to the higher Soviet officials. [492] Before he died, Nagell told me that at one point he was Oswald’s “handler.” To my knowledge, at no time did Nagell ever implicate Lyndon Johnson in the conspiracy. Over the years, Nagell claimed that he had stashed away photographs and a tape recording which would be revealed in the event of his death. He reiterated this to me in our conversation just before he died. To this date, this material has not surfaced, despite attempts by his estate executor to find it. It is noteworthy that at least one of Nagell’s footlockers has not been located. How does all of this fit with the evidence? For the most part, extremely well. Although not specific, Nagell’s story implies a “third force” which could reasonably be the H. L. Hunt/ Willoughby group working with their right-wing extremist allies in the military and anti-Castro Cubans. An important aspect of the Nagell story is his relationship with the Mafia. As noted earlier, Nagell"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"told Dick Russell that he had met Johnny Rosselli at the Friars Club in Los Angeles. (Recall from Chapter 21 William Harvey’s suspicious telephone call to the Friars Club in April 1963 from the Florida Keys.) Moreover, after Nagell died, his estate executor told me that he once said he had met Sam Giancana and Jimmy Hoffa in New York . Nagell also told the executor that he had been given the opportunity to become part of the mob and could have become rich, but he turned it down for “moral reasons.” (In discussions with Nagell and his estate executor, and from reading his letters, I have reached the opinion that Nagell was an ethical person and was extremely sensitive and idealistic.) Nagell’s strong early allegation that the FBI played a major part in the assassination is very significant in light of evidence later uncovered concerning the FBI’s complicity in the forgery of the Zapruder film; the FBI’s suppression of evidence in Dallas, New Orleans, and Mexico City; and widespread manipulations of statements of witnesses. Of additional interest is Nagell’s story that Oswald visited Mexico City twice. This fits with the evidence that Oswald (or his impersonator) visited the Cuban embassy twice in 1963. In the material that follows, I will outline several significant items concerning Nagell that shed considerable light on the mystery of the JFK assassination. Nagell’s investigation of the anti-Castro Cubans is of primary importance. In 1963 the CIA had begun to get very worried that one of its covert operations had gone out of control. The CIA hierarchy was trying to find out what was happening. This will be corroborated in Robert Morrow’s story. Robert Morrow: Engineer and CIA Special Problem Solver Robert Morrow relates his first-hand experience in the fringes of the JFK assassination when he was a senior agent for the CIA during the period leading up to November 22, 1963 and in the months following. What follows is excerpted primarily from Morrow’s book First Hand Knowledge. Morrow reported directly to his case officer, Tracy Barnes, who was in charge of the newly formed domestic operation division of the CIA. Barnes reported to Richard Bissell and General Charles Cabell, brother of the mayor of Dallas. Morrow’s story takes on significance in that it corroborates major aspects of Nagell’s story and confirms involvement of anti-Castro Cubans and the Mafia in the plot. Morrow’s credibility is generally high among those researchers who have cross-referenced or seriously commented on his writings. Many others consider him not credible at all. I had the opportunity to meet him in 1992 at a symposium in Chicago, and believe that he is generally credible. This was confirmed to me by respected author John Davis, who gave Morrow high marks in those parts of his writings that dealt with Morrow’s first-hand experience. [493] Morrow started his career as an electronics contractor and then had a two-year stint as an engineer for the military contractor, Martin Aircraft Company. He rose to a level of senior project engineer on innovative projects. He left Martin in 1958 and went into private consulting engineering and inventing. This resulted in contacts which brought his expertise in electronics and special technical projects to the notice of the CIA; they soon recruited him for special projects. These projects involved him in the JFK assassination. He worked for the CIA from 1959 to 1964. He ran unsuccessfully for Congress in Maryland in 1972. Morrow wrote that at the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion he and David Ferrie flew from Florida on a clandestine CIA operation to take measurements of high-performance electronic signals that the CIA suspected were emanating from a Soviet installation for launching ballistic missiles against the United States. Despite a harrowing experience, Morrow and Ferrie returned with the data which, according to"},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"Morrow, established the existence of offensive missile sites under preliminary construction long before it became official knowledge in the fall of 1962. Recall that Robert McNamara disputes that there was any such construction of missiles in Cuba at the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion. (This could cast doubt on Morrow’s story, but it is plausible that Morrow and the CIA interpreted the radar signals to be for offensive nuclear missiles when in fact they were not. It is also plausible that the Kennedy administration simply did not believe the information if it had, in fact, been presented to them. There is much controversy on that subject.) Morrow wrote that while on this Cuban mission with Ferrie, he first met Eladio del Valle, who was part of the CIA operation. As earlier noted, del Valle was murdered within a day or two after David Ferrie mysteriously “committed suicide” when he was accused by New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison of being involved in the Kennedy assassination. A most interesting part of Morrow’s story is that on July 1, 1963 [494] he was given an assignment by Tracy Barnes to purchase four 7.35mm Mannlicher-Carcano rifles from a surplus store located in Maryland. The next day, Morrow received a telephone call from del Valle who asked him to “supply him with four transceivers (walkie-talkies) that were not detectable by any communication on the market.” Morrow complied with his request by modifying four Motorola-made units that required an antenna several feet high. Morrow solved the problem by strapping a wire to the intended user’s leg, concealed under the trousers. This combination of walkie-talkies and a Mannlicher-Carcano rifle suspiciously appeared at Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963. Morrow wrote that after the assassination he was looking at photographs taken at Dealey Plaza and saw one of his walkie-talkies in the pocket of a man standing on Elm Street near the spot where Kennedy was shot. (Recall that Lee Bowers, the railway tower switchman, testified to the Warren Commission that he observed strange people driving in the area behind the picket fence and saw one of them using a walkie-talkie.) Three of the rifles that Morrow purchased, along with the walkie-talkies, were picked up by David Ferrie and flown to New Orleans. (The fourth rifle was found by Morrow to be defective, and he wrote that he still has it in his possession.) Writer Gus Russo told me that Morrow’s story about David Ferrie receiving the rifles and the walkie-talkies was corroborated by Lou Krieger, radio talk-show host. Krieger told Russo that he was very skeptical of Morrow’s story and, in order to check it out, visited the private airstrip near Baltimore where Morrow said he had turned over the equipment to Ferrie. This was at the Campbell Company, a brick manufacturer. Krieger said that he talked with a man at the airstrip who confirmed that a man with David Ferrie’s red wig and Southern accent had arrived in a private plane and picked up some weapons, returning to New Orleans during the period that Morrow had said it occurred, the first week of August 1963. [495] Morrow was told by Cuban exile leader Mario Garcia Kohly that the rifles were to be used in an operation against Juan Bosch, who was the head of the Dominican Republic. But Tracy Barnes, Morrow wrote, later became suspicious that the rifles might have had a more sinister purpose for use against “anybody, right up to the President.” Morrow wrote that Barnes sent another CIA operative to New Orleans and Miami to infiltrate Ferrie’s connections to see what was going on; the operative used the name “Joseph Kramer,” which is the fictitious name that Nagell said he used on this mission. This is a confirmation of Nagell’s story. It is also an indication that we have at least one of the CIA’s top people, Tracy Barnes, getting concerned that bad things were underway in one of their covert operations. Barnes may have suspected that the operation was spinning out of control. [496] Morrow’s account lends credence to the idea that high officials of the"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"CIA were not involved in the assassination, although they suspected it was being planned and were trying to find out what was going on. [497] One puzzling aspect concerning the rifles that Morrow delivered to Ferrie was that they were 7.35mm bore instead of the 6.5mm model found in the School Book Depository and linked to Oswald, although they were both Mannlicher-Carcanos. This can be partially explained by the fact that the manufacturer had re-barreled the 7.35mm model with a 6.5mm barrel because there was a plentiful supply of 6.5mm ammunition. Was Oswald able to purchase only the 6.5mm model by mail order without going to Morrow’s source in Maryland, thus making a connection to the CIA? These questions remain unanswered. My interest at this point is whether or not Morrow’s writing about 7.35mm rifles discredits his story. I think that it does not: if Morrow were making up a story, he would, it seems certain, have written about 6.5mm rifles, widely known at the time as Oswald’s rifle. The purchase of 7.35mm rifles has made his story suspect to some, but to me it provides credence. Morrow was deeply involved with the Cuban exiles. He was a CIA contact to Mario Garcia Kohly who is prominent in Morrow’s story. Kohly was slated by a right-wing faction of the CIA to be the next president of Cuba, once Castro was eliminated. Kohly was close to Vice President Nixon and had been picked by him to take over Cuba after the Bay of Pigs invasion. Nixon also represented Kohly as an attorney at one point. The story of Kohly is very interesting in that it explains much about the Bay of Pigs disaster and the political infighting that to some extent brought it about. Kohly was a prominent Cuban businessman and financier under the Batista regime. He and his family had been members of the Cuban aristocracy. He was a “distinguished statesman and diplomat,” spoke flawless English, and was highly regarded in international circles for his reputation in finance, having been one of Cuba’s banking elite. He represented a large number of American interests in Cuba. He had put together a number of heavy engineering ventures in Cuba, one an eighty-million-dollar project he was working on when Castro rose to power. [498] Kohly was a big-time operator. All of this property and enterprise was seized by Castro, devastating the economy, in the conversion of Cuba to communism. After Castro’s revolution, Kohly came to the United States and started to organize resistance groups and make plans for the overthrow of Castro. He allegedly had put together a large number of anti-Castro Cubans in an underground network in Cuba that was supported by militant groups in the United States. At one point, Kohly and Morrow were engaged in a CIA-sponsored operation counterfeiting Cuban pesos to be used to bribe Cubans at the time of the planned Cuban invasion. [499] Morrow relates an exchange between himself and Kohly after Kennedy disappointed the Cuban exiles in the Bay of Pigs invasion: “My God, what do we do?” I stupidly asked. “I say we kill the son of a bitch.” I ignored Mario’s remark, but could understand it.... [500] According to Morrow, Kohly had drafted the initial plans for an invasion of Cuba late in the Eisenhower administration, under Richard Nixon’s responsibility. The plans were adopted by the CIA with Richard Bissell designated to implement them. Kohly was introduced to Vice President Nixon, who was impressed and gave the go-ahead. [501] In October 1960, Nixon, Kohly, and CIA Deputy Charles Cabell met on the golf course at Burning Tree Club in Washington, D.C., and decided on a plan known as “Operation Forty,” which would later become what we now call the Bay of Pigs. The plan was that Kohly would become the new president of Cuba after a successful invasion, and it was agreed that Kohly could terminate all of the prominent Cuban"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"leftist leaders of the CRC. [502] [503] The Cubans who were to be eliminated were the leaders of a leftist faction that was a rival of the right-wing anti-Castro Cubans favored by the right-wing elements of the CIA. The plan was to take the leftist Cuban leaders to a location at Opa-Locka, at a deserted military base in southern Florida, and place them under house arrest. If the invasion proved to be successful, they would be taken to a beach in Cuba and killed. Kohly, the CIA’s choice, would then be in a position to become the next president of Cuba. [504] However, when the Bay of Pigs invasion failed, the leftist Cubans were released, unaware of the fate that had been planned for them. The leftist Cubans were flown to Washington, D.C., where they met with President Kennedy, who tried to console them and to make amends. [505] (Leftist exiles would become the faction of the Cuban exiles that were supported in later operations by the Kennedys, thus further alienating the right-wing faction.) In late November 1961, according to Morrow, Tracy Barnes assigned him a mission to fly to Madrid, Spain, with $210,000 in cash, where he met David Ferrie to facilitate a transfer of weapons from Permindex (the CIA front company, of which Clay Shaw was a member of the board of directors). The transfer took place in Piraeus, Greece, where the arms were stored in a Permindex warehouse. The destination of the weapons was Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana. This was the arms cache that would later be seized by the FBI on orders from the Kennedys. It was throughout the period from 1960 to late 1963 that Morrow describes himself as having contacts with Mafia figures and conversations with CIA’s Tracy Barnes and Washington, D.C., lawyer Marshall Diggs, that link Mafia chieftains Marcello, Giancana, and Trafficante. Morrow wrote that on October 9, 1962, Tracy Barnes told him of the direct contact inside Guy Banister’s operation in New Orleans by “Joseph Kramer” (Nagell). Barnes was concerned that Mario Kohly was getting “out of control.” Barnes also told Morrow about Oswald being a CIA agent just back from Russia. Barnes expressed his fear that this group might try to assassinate President Kennedy when the Cuban missile crisis broke loose. [506] Barnes gave Morrow the mission of determining the extent of Kohly’s role in Banister’s group in New Orleans. It was on July 1, 1963 that Tracy Barnes contacted Morrow telling him to buy the four Mannlicher- Carcano rifles. [507] On July 2, 1963, Eladio del Valle called Barnes and asked for the four walkie- talkies. By August 1, 1963, Morrow had completed his assignment of procuring the rifles and preparing the walkie-talkies. During the first week of August 1963, three of the rifles and the walkie-talkies were picked up by David Ferrie at a private airstrip in Maryland. In mid-summer 1963, Morrow met with Eladio del Valle at Churchills' Restaurant in New York; Manuel Rodriguez Quesada was present. At that meeting del Valle told Morrow that Oswald was being set up. [508] On October 9, 1963, Tracy Barnes revealed Oswald’s story to Morrow—that Oswald was in a Mafia-connected anti-Castro group in New Orleans comprised of Guy Banister, David Ferrie, Clay Shaw, and Jack Ruby. [509] On November 10, 1963, del Valle told Morrow that the rifles and walkie-talkies were to be used “For the big one....in Dallas....Kennedy’s going to get it in Dallas.” Morrow relayed this information to attorney Marshall Diggs, who worked with Tracy Barnes. [510] The day after Kennedy was assassinated, Morrow contacted Barnes when he realized that del Valle’s"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"talk of hitting Kennedy had been real. Barnes told Morrow not to worry, that everything had been taken care of. [511] Morrow wrote: The incredible story of the panic that rocked Langley immediately after JFK’s assassination was told to me by Marshall Diggs almost a year later. Diggs explained that, in order to cover up some monumental errors, a massive governmental conspiracy was instituted almost immediately. This resulted in one of the greatest smokescreens in history; one that would prevent anyone from discovering the President’s real assassins. It would be a story of continuing intrigue and murder. [512] The central thesis of Morrow’s writings is that the Kennedy assassination was the work of the Mafia, elements of the CIA, and right-wing Cuban exiles aligned with Guy Banister, Clay Shaw, and David Ferrie, all of whom were CIA-connected. This is consistent with Richard Case Nagell’s version of the assassination that he revealed over the years, except that Morrow goes further in implicating the CIA than did Nagell. In the spring of 1992, Morrow told Dick Russell that he should get in touch with Colonel William Bishop, who knew about Nagell and his activities in the Kennedy assassination plot. Morrow had first met Colonel Bishop in the early 1960s; Bishop was training a group of anti-Castro Cubans at a CIA camp in No Name Key in the Florida Keys. He had contacted Morrow after reading Morrow’s first book Betrayal, published in 1976. Morrow said that Colonel Bishop was dying of cancer (then 1992) and wanted to get his conscience clear by talking about the Kennedy assassination. Morrow suggested that Russell contact Colonel Bishop through Gary Shaw, who lived in the same town (Cleburne, Texas) as Bishop, and had heard from him. Colonel William Bishop: CIA Hit Man The story of Colonel William Bishop is very important because it: - Corroborates major elements of Nagell’s story; - Links General Charles Willoughby to the network of the assassination plot; - Brings Dallas oil men into the plot by way of recent information reported by Cuban intelligence in the Nassau conference; and, with other evidence, indicates involvement of H. L. Hunt and the “Texas High Cabal” in the plot; - Confirms that Jimmy Hoffa, through Carlos Marcello, provided money to anti-Castro Cubans for the assassination. - Further links William Harvey to the plot. Among the many important things learned at the 1995 Nassau conference with General Fabian Escalante and his Cuban study group was a statement by General Escalante concerning Colonel William Bishop. General Escalante said that in March 1964 the Cubans arrested a man by the name of Felipe Vidal Santiago when he was in a boat raid on the Cuban coast for a sabotage operation. Felipe Vidal Santiago [513] told his Cuban interrogators that in early November 1963 Colonel William Bishop picked him up in a car in Miami and drove him to Dallas where he gave him a room in a second- class hotel. While in Dallas, he said he attended a meeting with a few wealthy people in the Dallas Petroleum Club. He said he returned to Miami four days later. General Escalante told our group that this conversation was recorded on tape by Cuban intelligence because it was seen as being very"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"important. Vidal was later condemned to death and executed. According to Escalante, Vidal had been running operations for the CIA since 1962—as a CIA agent. Years later, General Escalante found Vidal’s name in Dick Russell’s book, and that prompted him to tell us the story of Vidal’s obviously important statement. Dick Russell had written in 1992 that Gerald Patrick Hemming had earlier told him a similar story about Vidal. Russell quoting Hemming: “ The week before the assassination, Felipe Vidal Santiago told my group that some people had approached him to go to a big meeting in Dallas that week ,” Hemming said. “We warned him and some other people not to go, that something funny was up. I’d heard of other meetings, where the conversation got steered around toward hitting JFK instead of Fidel. I’m talking about some friends of [Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio] Somoza, and about some people in Dallas. “It’s hard to say exactly who this select group of Cuban exiles was really working for,” Hemming continued. “For a while, they were reporting to Bill Harvey’s ex-FBI CIA guys. Some were reporting back to Hoover, or the new DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency]. There was a third force—pretty much outside CIA channels, outside our own private operation down in the Keys—that was doing all kinds of shit, and had been all through ’63. [514] (Emphasis added) The difference between Escalante’s story of Vidal and Hemming’s story is that Vidal placed himself in Dallas in early November, whereas Hemming placed Vidal in Dallas the week before the assassination. If both Hemming and Escalante were telling their stories accurately, Vidal had taken two trips from Miami to Dallas in November 1963 during the three weeks before the assassination. So, out of the blue at the Nassau conference in 1995, we have confirmation of elements of Hemming’s story about Vidal, and evidence linking Vidal to Colonel Bishop. It is important to note that it was Escalante, not Hemming, who linked Vidal to Colonel Bishop. Hemming had also told Dick Russell that Felipe Vidal Santiago had dealt directly with the Hunts in Dallas but “ they [the Hunts] did not want to know about operational plans .” [515] [516] The importance of Escalante’s statement at Nassau is that it corroborated a major part of what Hemming told Russell, and it links an anti-Castro Cuban directly to the Hunts in Dallas, and a CIA colonel, in discussions about killing Kennedy just three weeks before November 22. Also, Hemming’s stories, which have been scorned by some writers because Hemming himself was at one time a suspect in the Kennedy assassination and seemed to be such an unreliable character, now had some genuine credence. I determined that I should make an effort to interview Hemming; I had avoided him for too long. (My interviews with Hemming will be included in the next chapter.) Earlier, when I was in Dallas in 1994, I had met with Gary Shaw to discuss some of the forensic evidence. I told him of my interest in Colonel William Bishop, because I was seeking confirmation of Nagell’s story. (I had not yet heard of Felipe Vidal.) Gary replied, “I have a thick file on Colonel Bishop. When you are ready, give me a call.” Soon after that Gary decided to drop out of research in the Kennedy assassination, having had enough of it in many years of effort while maintaining his architectural practice in Dallas. I telephoned Gary a couple of times to try to set up an appointment with him, but all I got was his answering machine. He didn’t return my calls. I could understand, because that was exactly what I intended to do when my book was published. This subject can consume one’s life if one doesn’t know how to bring the endeavor to an end. With this new information from the Nassau conference, I knew I had to find more on Colonel Bishop. So while in Washington, D.C., I went to the Assassination Archives to see what might be uncovered. I found a file on Colonel Bishop, and in the same folder was a file on John Adrian O’Hare, who, it turns out, seemed to be the same person as Colonel Bishop. The O’Hare file had a mortuary report showing that"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"O’Hare had died in 1975. Also in the file there was a private detective’s report, apparently commissioned by the late Bernard Fensterwald, which indicated that the death certificate and burial report of O’Hare were falsifications. The file also contained a memorandum stating that Fensterwald had lifted Colonel Bishop’s fingerprints from a drinking glass, sent them to a contact within the FBI, and found that O’Hare’s and Bishop’s fingerprints matched. It appeared that CIA hit man John Adrian O’Hare had been made to disappear, then to reappear in Dallas with his old name, William Bishop. But when Bishop knew he was going to die he was compelled by his conscience to say something. In the same file was a memorandum apparently written by Bernard Fensterwald: 2/3/83 COL. WILLIAM J. BISHOP (U.S. Army Retired) On February 1, 1983, a large front-page story appeared on the front page of the local newspaper in Cleburne, Texas (between Dallas and Waco). The story related to a Rotary Club meeting on January 27, 1983, at which the principal speaker was Henry Hurt of Reader’s Digest , who is authoring a large update on the JFK assassination, to be published by Reader’s Digest Press for the 20th anniversary of the President’s death. The story prominently mentioned Gary Shaw, Hurt’s sponsor, who is a local architect and well-known assassination researcher. On the day that the story was published, Shaw received a telephone call from a man who introduced himself as “Col. William Bishop, retired military intelligence.” He said that he had “been close to” the President, and was a “friend” of Senator Ted Kennedy. He related that he had been in Dallas on November 22, 1963, helped put JFK’s remains in a body bag, and was involved in the pushing incident with the Dallas J.P. who wished to retain the body for a Texas autopsy. Colonel Bishop asked Shaw if the name Charles Bennett meant anything to him. (Answer—No.) Bishop was then asked about the name Maurice Bishop, the code name for a CIA employee who allegedly met Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas prior to the assassination. (Answer—Yes.) The last question was “what would you ask ‘Maurice Bishop’ if you could interview him? (Answer—It would depend on whether he admitted meeting with Oswald.) At this point, Col. Bishop suggested that Shaw assure himself of Bishop’s credibility by “checking with the Senator.” 1963 records show a Capt. Wm. J. Bishop at 10826 Joaquin Drive, Dallas; telephone 214-DA-1- 5331. 1983 records show a Col. Wm. J. Bishop at 712 Williams Ave., Cleburne, Texas; telephone 817- 645-2380. Shaw has no physical description of Bishop, as he has only talked with him on the phone. However, Shaw has met and seen Mrs. Bishop (from a prominent local family) and estimates from this that Bishop is probably in his 60s or early 70s. Bishop is suffering from bone cancer and is commuting from Cleburne to Dallas for treatment. Shaw hopes to meet with Bishop very soon. With this information, I knew I had to make contact with Gary Shaw. Through Bob Dorff, I arranged for Gary Shaw to receive my phone call. I telephoned Shaw on June 6, 1996 and began my conversation, telling him about the information that General Escalante had revealed about Felipe Vidal Santiago. This was news to Shaw. I asked him if Colonel William Bishop had ever mentioned Vidal’s name. To my surprise, Shaw said, “Yes, several times.” Inasmuch as Dick Russell had not linked Vidal with Colonel William Bishop in his book, this was corroboration of General Escalante’s statement, and, by simple logic, corroboration of Colonel Bishop’s and Hemming’s statements about Vidal. I went on to my next question."},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"I asked Shaw if he believed Colonel Bishop’s story about placing Kennedy’s body in a body bag and being involved in the pushing contest at Parkland Hospital on November 22. He answered that he had no reason to believe or not to believe it. He said he just didn’t have any corroboration of it. But later in our conversation Shaw mentioned that there was a document [517] showing that there was in fact a CIA man, identity unknown, at Parkland Hospital in Dallas on November 22, 1963. He also remembered a discussion in correspondence with Bud Fensterwald in which an FBI man had told Fensterwald that John Adrian O’Hare had traveled to Dallas on November 21, 1963. Colonel Bishop had told Dick Russell that he had traveled to Dallas on that same date; this was more corroboration of Colonel Bishop’s credibility. I then asked Shaw how important, in his view, is the story of John Adrian O’Hare. Shaw replied, “It could be very important.” He said that Bishop had, in fact, told him that he used the name O’Hare because he was at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport when it was decided that he needed another pseudonym. (It was common intelligence practice to pick a pseudonym that corresponded to the location where it was first assigned.) Shaw added that he and Bernard Fensterwald had pressed Colonel Bishop on the O’Hare matter and that Bishop became very upset, refusing to talk more about it. My next question was, “Did Colonel William Bishop ever mention H. L. Hunt?” Shaw replied, “Yes, and he also mentioned contacts with General Walker and a Colonel Josey.” He said that Bishop had mentioned having had contacts with H. L. Hunt and these people before the assassination. I asked Shaw if Bishop had ever mentioned once working for General Charles Willoughby. Shaw said “No,” [518] but added that Bishop did mention working in military intelligence under General Douglas MacArthur. Shaw agreed with me that, by inference, Bishop probably would have worked for Willoughby because Willoughby was chief of MacArthur’s military intelligence."},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"Colonel William C. Bishop, CIA assassin, worked closely with Cuban exile groups and said he ordered surveillance on Richard Case Nagell (another CIA agent) in New Orleans in 1963. Nagell claims that he was sent by the CIA to New Orleans, using the pseudonym “Joseph Kramer,” to investigate a covert operation suspected of planning to assassinate JFK. Colonel Bishop told writer Gary Shaw that General Edwin Walker met with Cuban exile Felipe Vidal Santiago in 1963 with two others. According to Bishop, the assassination of John Kennedy was discussed. Also, Bishop said he had attended meetings with General Edwin Walker and retired General Charles Willoughby in Dallas."},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"John Adrian O’Hare, CIA mercenary and assassin, thought to be responsible for the murder of Manuel Rodriguez Quesada and Gilberto Rodriguez Hernandez in 1964.

Shaw replied that he hadn’t. I asked if Colonel Bishop had ever mentioned David Sanchez Morales. Shaw said, “No.” I then asked if Colonel Bishop had ever mentioned Bill Harvey. Shaw said, “Yes, he had. He also mentioned E. Howard Hunt and Antonio Veciana.” Shaw added that Colonel Bishop had told him that the name Maurice Bishop applied not only to David Atlee Phillips but also to E. Howard Hunt and himself. Shaw said that at one point, to prove that he knew Veciana, Colonel Bishop called Veciana on the telephone while in Shaw’s office. (Shaw has a tape of this conversation.) I asked Shaw if Colonel Bishop had ever indicated that he was looking for money. Shaw responded that, in a way, yes. Shaw said he once loaned Bishop $250 and kept one of Bishop’s pistols as collateral. Bishop never paid back the money, but Shaw eventually sold the pistol and recovered his $250. Shaw said this was the only indication that Bishop was exploiting his information for money and that it was not a very significant thing. I asked if Colonel Bishop had ever given indications of being a disinformation agent for the government or the CIA. Shaw responded that he hadn’t. He said Bishop was a hireling, very bold, and had beyond question been involved with the anti-Castro Cubans in exile, but “could put the con on you faster than anyone he’d ever known.” Shaw added that during his long series of interviews with Bishop, Bishop was arrested in Dallas by the Secret Service for carrying an automatic weapon. Bishop was put on trial and, with the aid of a high-priced lawyer, got off. He said Bishop was the most amazing character he’d ever seen. Shaw said that once when Bishop was in his office, he suddenly pulled out a gun because he thought someone was coming in the back door. Shaw said it shocked him because he didn’t know that Bishop was carrying a gun. Shaw said that he had attempted to obtain Colonel Bishop’s military record through a friend in the Pentagon, and the friend instigated a search and found that there was no record of him. But, Shaw said, Bishop had a green military identification card similar to that found in Oswald’s possessions that could get him into any military base at any time. He said that he could get in Carswell Air Force Base, or any other military place. This reminded me of Bob Walton’s story about David Sanchez Morales, who had a mysterious little black card that could get him in anywhere and that, also, Morales was buried as a sergeant when, according to Reuben Carbajal, he was a major general in the Army. I mentioned to Shaw that, from my reading of Dick Russell, Bishop was very emphatic that he had been subjected to the MK ULTRA mind-control program. Shaw said yes, that was true, and that Bishop claimed it had made him impotent. Shaw said that Bishop did not actually use the name MK ULTRA, but instead described it as mind control using drugs and hypnosis. Shaw said that after talking with me he planned to get out his file on Colonel Bishop and corroborate some of the things he had told me from memory. He added that he was certain there were probably more things of interest, but he wouldn’t be able to get to it for a few days because he had an architectural project to complete. I asked him if he would provide a complete copy of his files on Bishop, and he replied that he would be glad to. When I hung up the phone, I reflected that things were really falling into place. The combination of Nagell’s, Morrow’s, and Bishop’s stories seemed to be an outline of a major compartment of the assassination plot, and the stories seemed to corroborate each other, fitting together very well indeed— and also were in complete harmony with the reports of General Escalante’s group. While waiting for Shaw’s files on Bishop to arrive, I decided to go into the John Martino story, then come back to Colonel Bishop and incorporate what I would learn from Shaw’s files."},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"John Martino: Mafia/CIA Operative John Martino is one more CIA-Mafia operative who had foreknowledge of the JFK assassination. An important aspect of Martino’s story is that it was confirmed by his wife and in part by his son; and also told to a Newsday reporter; and Martino had instructed that it not be revealed until after his death. In 1994 Anthony Summers and his wife Robbyn interviewed Martino’s widow Florence, age eighty, and her son Edward. Mrs. Martino said she was with her husband at their home in Miami Beach on November 22, 1963. She had a vivid memory of that moment: We were supposed to go out to the Americana for lunch.... But it was on the radio about [the visit to] Dallas.... We were talking about President Kennedy. And he said, “Flo, they’re going to kill him. They’re going to kill him when he gets to Dallas.” [519] Summers wrote that Mrs. Martino said she had questioned her husband briefly, got no response, went out for a while, and was home again by the time her son Edward heard the news of the assassination on television: “When I called them in,” he [Edward] remembered, “my father went white as a sheet. But it wasn’t like ‘Gee whiz’; it was more like confirmation.” “Then John was on the phone...,” Florence remembered. “He got I don’t know how many calls from Texas. I don’t know who called him, but he was on the phone, on the phone, on the phone....” [520] Newsday reporter John Cummings, who knew Martino from previous years, told Summers that in 1975 Martino told him “he’d been part of the assassination of Kennedy. He wasn’t in Dallas pulling the trigger, but he was involved. He implied that his role was delivering money, fabricating things.... He asked me not to write it while he was still alive.” [521] Martino told Cummings that anti-Castro Cubans were involved, that there had been two guns and two people involved. [522] Summers wrote: The last time he met reporter Cummings, John Martino made an astonishing claim. “It came out of the blue,” Cummings recalls. “John told me he had himself met Oswald several weeks before the assassination, in Miami. He said an F.B.I. agent named Connors asked him to come to a boat docked in Biscayne Bay, and introduced him to Oswald by name. The impression John got was that Oswald didn’t know his ass from his elbow, didn’t know what he was involved in. He thought the agent wanted him to meet Oswald because John was involved in anti-Communist activity, and Oswald was someone this agent was running.” We have not been able to trace a Miami agent called Connors answering the description provided by Cummings. F.B.I. files show Martino did have contacts after the assassination with an agent named James J. O’Connor, whom we tracked down in retirement. “John Martino?” he said. “I’m afraid all I could tell you is, yes, the name rings a bell.... I don’t recall that he was a regular contact.” O’Connor said he cannot recall whether he was in touch with Martino before the assassination. He said he never met Oswald at any time. Cummings, an investigative reporter for more than 30 years, does not think the Martino allegation was just a crook’s slur against a law-enforcement officer. “I believed Martino,” he says. “It came across, just before he died, like a confessional. I was told that Connors, the agent he named, was in Counter-Intelligence. [523]"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"Florence Martino died one month after Summers’ interview in 1994. [524] (John Martino died on August 3, 1975 at the age of sixty-four. At the time of the JFK assassination, he was fifty-two years old.) John Martino’s story takes on even more significance in that he was associated with Santo Trafficante. They had been arrested and incarcerated together in Cuba. Moreover, Martino was closely associated with William Pawley, a co-founder of the Flying Tigers, ex-ambassador to Peru and Brazil, and right-wing multi-millionaire. Pawley was a CIA contract agent, close to Allen Dulles. [525] In 1963, John Martino was deeply involved with William Pawley in a controversial plot to discredit JFK by proving that Soviet missiles were still in Cuba. The plot included the use of Pawley’s boat Flying Tiger to tow a small boat that would be used in a covert operation to land a group of Cuban exiles in Cuba. It was thought that they would be able to bring back witnesses to verify that offensive missiles were still in Cuba, thus embarrassing the Kennedy administration. The plot was financed, in part, by Henry and Clare Boothe Luce. The operation was a failure. None of the Cubans who went ashore in the mission were ever heard from again. [526] William Pawley’s involvement in anti-Castro activities began to surface in the late 1970s. In 1977 Gaeton Fonzi added Pawley’s name to the list of people to be questioned by the HSCA. Around that time Pawley contracted a nervous ailment (shingles) and—one week after his name was added to the list— committed suicide with a gunshot wound in the chest. This was one more key person dying suddenly when investigators were zeroing in on him. The list includes David Ferrie, Johnny Rosselli, Sam Giancana, David Sanchez Morales, and George de Mohrenschildt. Pawley has emerged as potentially a very important person in the Kennedy assassination. Through his Far Eastern experiences with the Flying Tigers in military operations, is it reasonable to assume that Pawley had linkages to General Willoughby? Like Willoughby, Pawley was a virulent, high-level anti- Communist; he had financial motives to see John F. Kennedy eliminated, having lost considerable properties in Cuba when Castro took over. Rumors linked Pawley to Mafia leaders having investments in Cuba. He was a long-time friend of Richard Nixon and one of the planners of the Bay of Pigs. Pawley was involved over the years with David Atlee Phillips, Tracy Barnes, and E. Howard Hunt—all characters who show up in the evidence surrounding the Kennedy assassination. These CIA operatives were the leaders in the successful 1954 coup in Guatemala in which President Jacobo Arbenz was deposed and replaced with a government that had the blessings of the United Fruit Company, which had large banana holdings in Guatemala. The coup was Allen Dulles’s godchild. President Eisenhower approved the coup as part of the Cold War effort to stop the spread of communism using covert means as found to be necessary. Its success led to a similar plan—the Bay of Pigs—to overthrow Castro’s Cuba using Guatemala as a staging ground. [527] Pawley was a very special CIA agent. He communicated directly with Allen Dulles and had numerous connections to both the Eastern High Cabal and the Texas High Cabal. [528] Pawley is one person who could have been used by a powerful civilian group to bypass Allen Dulles, the CIA hierarchy, the Executive Branch, and the entire U.S. government to attain direct access to a CIA-military assassination team, as suggested to me by Colonel Fletcher Prouty, although Prouty didn’t mention Pawley’s name. To divert for a moment, let us examine this incredible ménage of millionaires, industrialists, extremists, and corrupt politicians—bringing into the scene their various secret transgressions and liaisons. It is not a pretty picture. For example, Clare Boothe Luce was at one time the mistress of Allen Dulles and another time bedded with the anti-Communist fanatic General Charles Willoughby. Meanwhile, Allen Dulles’s ex-mistress, Mary Bancroft, had an affair with Henry Luce, husband of Clare"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"Boothe Luce and owner of Life magazine. We then have the rabid, racist billionaire H. L. Hunt with his three wives simultaneously; now adding in the crackpot General Edwin Walker, who turned out to be a closet homosexual; and J. Edgar Hoover and Clyde Tolson and lackey Roy Cohn all in the same category. Mix this with John F. Kennedy and his multiple adulterous affairs, including one with Marilyn Monroe, and Robert Kennedy and his affair with Marilyn Monroe; plus the mendacious, criminally minded Lyndon Johnson and his mistresses, and Johnson buying every election he ever won; and the Kennedys’ involvement with the Mafia in buying the 1960 presidential election. Added to this we have the partnership of the CIA with the Mafia to assassinate foreign leaders, the CIA’s involvement in Allen Dulles’s grotesque, ultra-secret mind-control programs to develop robot assassins, and the CIA and organized crime’s partnership in illegal arms shipments and drug running, and we have a picture that is so outlandish and complex as to defy the imagination; and we are not even getting started with a long list of other dangerous secrets that can be enumerated. [529] These people did not play by the prescribed rules. They made up their own rules as they went along. They all lived lives of deceit and betrayal. Out of this mise en scène exotique emerged the decision to assassinate John F. Kennedy. But to get back to more salient evidence, let’s conclude our discussion concerning the very important John Martino. The HSCA became very interested in Martino in 1977 when an anonymous informant called “Fred from Fort Worth” telephoned the committee several times and indicated a close relationship with John Martino, who had recently died. A synopsis of the HSCA’s investigation of Martino in 1977 was provided in a memorandum by investigators Fonzi and Gonzales. ...“Fred” said that Martino told him he “worked for the CIA” and that Kennedy was killed by anti-Castro Cubans. Martino said the assassins knew the motorcade route before they went to Dallas. Fred said that Martino’s widow would have knowledge of such information. Fred also suggested that a former employer of Martino, Alan Roth, would provide information. On being interviewed, Mrs. John Martino denied her husband ever had any association with the CIA, but produced names of her husband’s associates who were involved in CIA operations. She said her husband was arrested by Castro in Cuba because he was mistaken for a Navy Commander with the same name. She produced material which indicated her husband had given lectures claiming that Castro was involved in the Kennedy assassination. [530] Former employers Alan Roth and son Kenneth Roth said, when interviewed, that Martino told them he had been involved in CIA operations. They said they believe Martino was related to Mafia boss Angelo Bruno of Philadelphia. They provided information of possible Martino involvement in gun dealing. They could provide no information of Martino’s involvement in or knowledge of the Kennedy assassination. They provided information which indicates the possible identity of “Fred.” It was nineteen years later that Anthony and Robbyn Summers interviewed Mrs. Martino just before she died. The HSCA had been hot on the trail of one more suspect who could have led to the solution of the crime, but the committee was prematurely shut down before the investigation led to agencies of the U.S. government. In the HSCA’s aborted investigation of John Martino, Mrs. Martino revealed that her husband knew Gerry Patrick Hemming. And that he knew Frank Sturgis (of Watergate fame); but she denied that her husband had any association with the CIA. In 1977, Fonzi and Gonzales interviewed Alan Roth, who Florence Martino said was instrumental in causing her husband to go to Cuba in 1958. (Roth was then opening the Deauville Hotel in Havana): Alan Roth said: “I knew Johnny from back in ’32 when he was sent from Atlantic City. I represented a strip of South Beach real estate and I leased a few places for bingo and slot machines, which were legal then. Johnny was sent down from Atlantic City and put in charge of repairs. Later,"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"when the next I heard, he was in Las Vegas.” Kenneth Roth said: “Johnny was supposed to have been related to Angelo Bruno, his brother-in- law or something. He always told me he had Mafia relatives but he always said he never wanted to have anything to do with them.” Alan Roth said that Martino “was around me doing odd and end jobs” when he was building the Deauville Hotel in Havana. Roth said he leased the casino in the hotel to Santo Trafficante.... Roth said Martino got in trouble with Castro because he “was doing things” for a couple of Cuban brothers, contractors whose names he couldn’t recall, who were involved in anti-Castro activity. That’s why Martino was arrested, he said. Kenneth Roth said Martino told him he had gone on operations with the CIA to Cuba , but provided no details. After Martino returned from prison in Cuba, Roth said, he became very close with former Ambassador William Pawley.... The Roths said Martino was sent to Guatemala to “look after” their accounts receivable from their real estate interests there. Martino became very friendly with Jorge Maldanado, the secretary to the vice president of Guatemala, and was involved in several deals, including the sale of bulletproof vests and guns. According to the Roths, the person involved in the bulletproof vests deal with Martino was Fred Claasen , last known address: 2407 North Clifton, Fort Worth, Texas.... The Roths said that Martino tried once to make a deal involving “some kind of machine guns” in Guatemala and that his contact was someone in Fort Lauderdale, but they could recall no additional details. (Emphasis added) John Martino would prove to be even more important as the evidence accumulated. The Colonel William Bishop Files On the last day of July 1996 I received Gary Shaw’s original files on Colonel William Bishop. It was a package about four inches thick, and was absolutely astounding, representing interviews of Colonel Bishop by Shaw and others over a nine-year period, plus the results of research by attorney Bernard Fensterwald and others concerning Colonel Bishop. I initially spent six hours rapidly poring over the information, during which I listed what appeared to be the most relevant points of evidence applicable in this book. Shaw’s notes, neat and succinct, confirmed all that he had told me when I interviewed him on the telephone, and more. The first thing in the notes that struck me was that, according to Colonel Bishop, Felipe Vidal Santiago had indeed been in contact with him many times and, moreover, was a close associate of General Edwin Walker: Vidal was General Walker’s source on Cuban affairs. [531] Also of great importance in Shaw’s package was an FBI document stating that Vidal had been very close to John Martino. In fact, Martino had used Vidal as his source on anti-Castro Cuban affairs. [532] In a taped conversation on February 8, 1983, Colonel William Bishop told Gary Shaw that Felipe Vidal Santiago was executed in March or April of 1964. This agrees with the information given by General Fabian Escalante at the Nassau conference in 1995. This seemed to be confirmation of Bishop’s knowledge of Vidal and anti-Castro Cuban operations, at least insofar as his statements about Vidal. [533]"},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"In the same taped conversation on February 8, 1983 between Bishop and Shaw, Bishop said that he was present at General Edwin Walker’s house when Walker, Vidal, Robert [Roy] Hargraves, and two others discussed the assassination of JFK. This occurred about one week after the Walker sniper incident in April 1963. [534] To my surprise, Gary Shaw’s memory about Colonel Bishop’s failure to mention General Willoughby had not been correct. Bishop had indeed mentioned Willoughby, just days before Bishop died! On June 23, 1992, Bishop told Shaw that he had gone to see Walker a few times and, during their meetings, General Charles Willoughby was present. When Bishop revealed that information to Gary Shaw, he had just had two heart attacks. He died within a few days, and his funeral services were held on July 5, 1992. [535] Of great interest was that Bishop told Shaw that Vidal had been driven in a 1957 black-and-white Chevrolet from Miami to Dallas in 1963; the same make, model, and year as the automobile shown in the photograph (See Exhibit 27-1) taken outside of General Walker’s home at about the time he was allegedly shot at. Another item of significance was a paragraph in an FBI document in Shaw’s files, which reads: [deleted] further advised that on the morning of August 19, 1963, he observed another vehicle with three Cubans departing the vicinity of Big Pine Key [Florida]. He described the vehicle as a 1957 Chevrolet, bearing 1963 Florida license 1.33002. [three lines deleted] the car appeared to be driven by a medium- sized Cuban with a prominent black mustache. (Vidal was described by Colonel Bishop as a “ruddy, white Cuban, athletic, smoker, black hair, excellent rifle & pistol, mustache on occasion....” [536] See photos of Vidal). When the Dallas Police were questioned by the Warren Commission about the photograph of the 1957 Chevrolet, they said that the hole was in it when it was found in Oswald’s possessions. Later, however, when retired police chief Jesse Curry wrote his book JFK Assassination File, he included a photograph showing Walker’s house and the 1957 Chevrolet with the automobile’s license plate still intact. [537] Marina Oswald had earlier testified to the Warren Commission that when she saw the photograph there was no hole obscuring the license plate. In his book Cover-Up, Gary Shaw had noted that he interviewed an individual (name not given) who was used by General Walker in 1963 as a “watch” (lookout man). This person told Shaw that several days before the attempt on the general, he observed a Cuban or dark-complexioned man in a 1957 Chevrolet cruising slowly back and forth in front of the Walker residence. Shaw also wrote that a 1957 Chevrolet with stolen license plates was apparently used in conjunction with the murder of Dallas policeman J. D. Tippit. [538] As I went through Shaw’s notes, more and more pieces of the puzzle came together confirming what I had previously written. In one of the notes, Shaw had written that when Colonel William Bishop was shown a photograph of David Morales, he said that it was a very familiar name and face and thought he was one of the CIA men he knew and saw in Dallas on the day of the assassination. [539] It is important to note that this was three years before Gaeton Fonzi’s book was published revealing the evidence about Morales for the first time. Also recall that in my interview with Robert Walton, he had told me that Morales implied that he was in Dallas at the time of the Kennedy assassination."},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"Exhibit 27-1.

Bishop said that the information came to him from Cuban General Francisco C. Tabernilla (Cuba’s former commander of the Cuban air force and “Cuba’s General Patton,” according to Bishop). Bishop said that the transaction took place in a Miami hotel “man to man” and the money was in a briefcase. He also said that Vidal was very close to Masferrer. [540] Bishop said that Masferrer had become deeply involved with the Mafia and had told him in October 1963 that he would kill Kennedy if he got the chance. He said that Masferrer was in Trenton, New Jersey, at the time of the assassination. Bishop said this information came from Antonio Veciana of Alpha 66. Bishop also said that Vidal was a member of Alpha 66. [541] Another item of interest that ties in with gun running in Dallas is that Bishop told Shaw that he had just read the story of Nancy Perrin Rich in Fensterwald’s book, and that he (Bishop) had attended the meeting in which Nancy Perrin Rich claimed she had met with a colonel, Jack Ruby, and others, discussing gun-running activities. Bishop said he was at that meeting but did not know Jack Ruby, and had never connected him to the incident. Bishop also said that he didn’t remember that the son of Genovese was present; but, most important, Bishop said that Felipe Vidal Santiago was present at the meeting . [542] (The Nancy Perrin Rich story and gun running in Dallas were discussed in the previous chapter.) Bishop told Shaw that he knew for a fact that Antonio Veciana worked for David Atlee Phillips; that he (Bishop) had once attended a meeting in which Phillips, Veciana, and Richard Helms were all three present. [543] On February 17, 1983, Bishop told Gary Shaw that Richard Helms gave the order for the assassination. (I recalled Robert McNamara’s fervent remark that Helms would never have plotted to kill President Kennedy.) One of the two gunmen, according to Bishop, was an expert rifleman whom Bishop knew as Emmanuel Rodriguez. [544] Bishop said that he personally killed Rodriguez by shooting him in the back of the head while on a fishing boat at sea, then dumped him overboard. [545] Also, on February 11, 1983, Bishop called Antonio Veciana from Gary Shaw’s office; the conversation was taped. The purpose of the call was to prove to Shaw that Bishop knew Veciana. [546] Bishop told Shaw that he had been subjected to the CIA mind-control program using drugs and hypnosis (to create robot-like assassins). He said the success rate of that program was 3 to 5 percent. [547] Bishop told Shaw that he once ran for senator in the state of Georgia against Sam Nunn, and that he (Bishop) knew Ted Kennedy. Bernard Fensterwald later telephoned Senator Nunn who did remember Bishop. Nunn said that he was not a threat. [548] Fensterwald also called Ted Kennedy, but Kennedy couldn’t remember Bishop, saying that thousands of people pass through his activities. Gary Shaw obtained copies of certificates from Colonel Bishop showing that he was discharged from the Army as a colonel and that he had a large number of other credentials such as credit cards, ID cards, etc., in the name of Colonel William C. Bishop. [549] Of particular note is that Colonel Bishop told Shaw he had been a member of the ZR/RIFLE program and knew William K. Harvey as William K. Smith. [550] The importance of this will presently become"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"apparent. In Shaw’s notes were two envelopes filled with copies of Colonel Bishop’s card files from the early 1960s. I went through the cards and there were addresses and phone numbers of an amazing array of characters and political figures. This included Eladio del Valle; Rolando Masferrer; Robert [Roy] Hargraves (noted as a friend of Felipe); names of members of Rolando Masferrer’s Tiger group; Mario Garcia Kohly Sr.’s address, apartment number, phone number, places where he could be reached; and the home address and home phone number of CIA director John McCone. Also included were the address of Kent Crane, noted as presidential assistant at the White House; the home phone number of Admiral Taswell Shephard; the home address and phone number of Julian Sourwine (associated with William Pawley and Senator Strom Thurmond); and the home address and phone number of Colonel Don W. Josey, whom Bishop listed as “millionaire, possible source of funds.” Included on a card was detailed information on a man by the name of William Grosh, who “lives with Mario, have good reason to believe homo—drives 1962 Buick SPCO&V(Y), car bought in name of William K. Smith [William Harvey] at 1825 Kenney Drive, Falls Church, Virginia!” Listed was the home address, vacation hideout, and phone number of Marshell [ sic ] Diggs (prominent attorney in Washington, D.C., who had connections to the CIA—recall that Robert Morrow wrote of Marshall Diggs); detail on Ralph Dungan, special assistant to the president; the name of Dungan’s secretary; a notation “NW Gate, 5 pm, Monday, 3-19-62.” Of note was a card with the home address and phone number of Senator Strom Thurmond with details and scribblings of other information; telephone numbers apparently related to Senator John Tower; and the home address and telephone number of John Kennedy’s close friend Senator George Smathers; the home address and telephone number of John Rousselot, West Coast coordinator for the John Birch Society; the home address and telephone number of ex-Florida Senator Claude Pepper; the telephone number of a Captain Morgan [551] with notation “Army G2”; the home address and telephone number of General Bonner Fellers with numerous notations and newspaper clippings about him being a top member of the John Birch Society; and the home address and phone number of Allen Dulles. (The reader will recall that these cards were from the early 1960s, not from when Bishop ran for senator later.) This incredible list of contacts of Colonel William Bishop deserves a detailed research project beyond the scope of this book in order to assess its complete significance. I can see why Gary Shaw described Colonel Bishop as the most amazing person he had ever met in his life. However, at first reading, there were parts of Colonel Bishop’s statements to Gary Shaw that troubled me. For example, Bishop told Shaw that he had corresponded directly with President Kennedy, and that his letters had been ordered by President Johnson to be sealed for fifty years. He said this was President Johnson’s last act before he left office. Bishop said that he was instrumental in getting Kennedy to delay the Bay of Pigs invasion for seven days; apparently Bishop had arranged a meeting with Kennedy and told him that the Cubans who had been chosen by the Kennedy administration to head the new government in Cuba were in fact hard-line Communists, worse than Castro himself, and that Kennedy was being set up by the Soviets to induce the United States to invade Cuba so that Castro could be replaced by Communists more favorable to Krushchev. This, explained Bishop, was instrumental in Kennedy’s not providing full military support for the Bay of Pigs invasion and that, in fact, the invasion was “designed to fail.” When I read this in Shaw’s notes, my first impulse was that it diminished Colonel Bishop’s credibility, but upon further reflection I decided that it did not. My reasons were: first and foremost, that the Felipe Vidal Santiago evidence had two independent corroborations from both General Escalante and the much-maligned Gerald Patrick Hemming. Second, although Bishop’s alleged contacts with President Kennedy were incredible, they were not without plausible foundation. I recalled the story recounted by"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"Captain Bradley Ayers about Robert Kennedy visiting anti-Castro Cuban exiles in the Florida Keys in the early 1960s, and I recalled that John Kennedy had in fact brought Cuban exiles (including Varona) from Opa-Locka where they were being held pending the Bay of Pigs invasion, and had personally discussed their plight with them. I also recalled President Kennedy’s inclination to make first-hand contact with top spies and CIA operatives. And I recalled that Robert Kennedy had invited Green Berets to his home at Hyannis Port for first-hand contact with them. From this I concluded that it was not out of the realm of possibility that Colonel Bishop was telling the truth in this matter. In addition, supporting Bishop’s statements of personal contacts with Kennedy, I noted in Bishop’s address cards what appeared to be an appointment date of March 19, 1962 at 5 p.m. at the northwest gate of the White House. In any event, Bishop’s claim of personal contact with President Kennedy did not discredit the extreme importance of the Felipe Vidal Santiago evidence. There was one more item in Shaw’s notes on Colonel Bishop that took me aback. In notes dated May 7, 1983, Shaw wrote: [Bishop] told me today that he killed Hoffa: Two men brought him to his room. [Hoffa] had pink pillowcase on his head. [Bishop] shot him three times in his head with 22 cal. It has long been alleged that Hoffa was killed by the CIA because of his knowledge of the JFK assassination and the ZR/RIFLE program. It was noted in Chapter 15 that Tony Provenzano was involved in the Hoffa murder—Hoffa had been picked up and taken somewhere never to be seen again. Was Colonel Bishop telling the truth? There’s no way to know, but, again, it is not totally implausible. I remembered Robert McNamara’s parting remark to me that “They may have knocked off a few gangsters.” Was Hoffa one of them? It did not seem unreasonable to me that the CIA, knowing that Hoffa, Giancana, and Rosselli were involved in the JFK assassination, may have decided that they were about to tell all and systematically proceeded to silence them, with the help of Marcello and Trafficante. This would apply even if the CIA were largely innocent of involvement in the JFK assassination. National security was at stake, you know, and anything goes to protect national security. Good riddance. (Recall that CIA senior officer John Scelso, in his testimony before the HSCA, voiced his suspicion that William Harvey had been the one who killed Sam Giancana. See Chapter 21.) Going through Shaw’s notes, I did not find reference to Dick Russell’s interview of Colonel William Bishop in which Bishop had confirmed the existence of Richard Case Nagell as a CIA operative involved in penetration of Alpha 66 and anti-Castro Cuban activities. I presumed that this was because Russell had taken his own notes and Shaw had been only a bystander in that interview. Dick Russell interviewed Colonel Bishop in May 1990. The interview was conducted at the home of Gary Shaw in Cleburne, Texas. It was about two years before Russell’s book about Nagell was published. In this interview, Colonel Bishop told Russell that he had made the hit on Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo because both the CIA and the Pentagon had wanted Trujillo dead. Bishop said it was more effective to kill one man than it was to lose a thousand with an all-out invasion. He told Russell that he could still hit a playing card at five hundred yards with a rifle or a machine gun—that it was a professional challenge, no more and no less. Bishop said that the reason he was talking was because he felt an obligation, within reason, to bring about some realistic approach to U.S. history. He said that he firmly believed that in “our system of government, if you don’t like the man, then vote him out of office. Don’t shoot him out. And we had a coup d’etat on November 22, 1963.” He added that he was still governed by the National Security Act, implying that there were other things that he could not tell. Bishop said he did not look into Oswald’s background, had never met him, but had seen him in a"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"training film in New Orleans. Bishop said that he just happened to be in the group out there at the Pontchartrain camp. He said Oswald was trying to get in with the anti-Castro exiles. He said that after the assassination he thought Oswald was a decoy. He said that “there’s no way in hell he could have fired three shots in that space of time, with that accuracy, with that weapon.” He said the Warren Commission’s investigation was a big joke; that they did not assimilate the information coming in from the field— military intelligence, CIA/FBI. He said the commission’s conclusion was overly simplified. Russell displayed a photocopy of a 1962 passport of Richard Case Nagell, and, without offering his name, passed it across the table. Bishop studied it for a moment and then said, “Where did you get this?” Russell replied that Nagell had given it to him. Bishop then said, “I know him. What about him? What do you want to know?” Russell asked Bishop if he knew this person under the name Nagell. Bishop replied no, that they all used code names back in those days, but that the man (Nagell) was with Alpha 66. He asked Russell if Nagell admitted to that. Russell replied that he knew Nagell had some cognizance at least of the Alpha 66 group in 1962 and 1963. Bishop then changed the subject. He asked, “Have you ever heard of Operation Forty?” Russell responded that he had read about Operation Forty, the then-ultrasecret CIA assassination plan set up before the Bay of Pigs invasion. Bishop then brought out a series of photographs of Latin-looking individuals. On the backs of the pictures were the words “Special talent 1960-65, Ice pick man...Butcher...Sniper and demo [demolition] expert...Prop[aganda]...Knife man...Pilot and navigator...Mutilator.” Bishop said, “We weren’t playing a nice game.” Russell wrote that on some of the pictures were inscribed two more words: “Destino— Mexico.” Russell asked whether this meant that these particular people had operated out of Mexico. “Yep,” said Bishop, “Lotta times they would cover their tracks by declaring themselves as nationals of Mexico or Nicaragua, Panama, didn’t make any difference.” Russell wrote that Bishop conceded that he had been in Mexico City “two or three times in 1963,” but when Russell asked about the purpose, Bishop replied that he would rather make no comment on that. He said it was national security. “It had something to do with Cuba, but not as such.” Russell wrote that much later in the interview Bishop claimed to have met Nagell when he was an associate of Rolando Masferrer. Russell recalled in his book that Nagell had told him that one of his original assigned targets was to kill Rolando Masferrer. Nagell had made another reference to Masferrer in a letter to Russell not long after Masferrer was blown to bits by a dynamite bomb planted in his car. Nagell had noted, “pleased to read that the tiger finally got his.” Colonel Bishop told Russell that he finally realized that Nagell was with intelligence under CIA contract and it was safe to assume that Nagell was involved in Alpha 66. Bishop said it was when he was in New Orleans that Nagell’s presence came up. Nagell had been there several times and was trying to get into the inner workings of the anti-Castro movement. He said Nagell was asking too many pointed questions about things he had no business knowing. Bishop said that his end was to try to determine “who the hell he [Nagell] was.” He said he called Bill Colby at the CIA, with whom he had participated in paratrooper training at Fort Benning in 1940. He asked Colby, “Who the hell is this?” and Colby replied, “I don’t know the man, use discretion.” Bishop said that it was several months after that when he heard about the Nagell shooting at the bank. Bishop said he did know that there was a Cuban after Nagell and that Antonio Veciana had told him that. He said there were rumors that Nagell had stumbled onto the fact that there was an assassination being seriously planned. So, in Bishop’s opinion, the reason for the bank shoot-up in El Paso was for Nagell to get himself picked up and protected. (This was also confirmed to me previously by Nagell’s estate executor, who said Nagell had said that was the reason.) Bishop told Russell that he was in New Orleans that summer to obtain additional funding from the New Orleans crime syndicate for Alpha 66. He said Rolando Masferrer was the key bagman at that point. Primarily the funding came through the syndicate because of Masferrer’s connections with them back in Cuba. He said that Masferrer had ties with Santo Trafficante, Jr., and other criminal elements. He said he"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"thought that Masferrer also had different ties with Jimmy Hoffa as far back as 1962. He said Masferrer was killed because he had sticky fingers and kept some of the money for himself; it was either that reason or because he knew about the Kennedy assassination. We shall now go to the story of Gerald Patrick Hemming. We shall see that Hemming’s presence intertwines with almost all of the characters and episodes that have been related in this book, and his story adds important new material. I had been warned by two prominent researchers that if I took Hemming seriously, my book would be completely discredited. But by now I had reached the conclusion that too many key witnesses, who later turned out to have been telling the truth, had been trashed because they were, variously, ex-convicts, prostitutes, drug addicts, mistresses, strip-tease dancers, embellishers, or whatever labels they might have —my thought was that we shouldn’t expect to find many Eagle Scouts, choirboys, or vestal virgins in the circles of the men who killed Kennedy."},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"“There is just one thing that I might add about cover.

Within a few days Fonzi had made the arrangements. I called Hemming mid-day on August 28, 1996. I hoped for no more than confirmation of what Hemming had told Dick Russell—that Vidal had gone to Dallas for a “big meeting” the week before the assassination, and in addition, had dealt directly with the Hunts in Dallas prior to that meeting. What follows are the most relevant excerpts condensed from a series of long interviews with Gerald “Gerry” Patrick Hemming over a nine to ten-month period, starting in late August 1996. This information is from an alleged CIA operative who was on the fringes of the JFK plot, if not in the plot itself. Hemming not only knew Oswald but was deeply involved in the CIA’s assassination operations and tradecraft, and was willing to talk about it. There aren’t very many people like that still alive. I saw an opportunity to learn something. It is undoubted that Hemming was closely linked to Loran Hall and William Seymour, whom the reader may recall were falsely reported by the FBI to be the two visitors to Silvia Odio in late September 1963—the famous “Leopoldo” and “Angel” who appeared at her doorstep with Oswald (see Chapter 17). Hemming was also known to have been in Los Angeles in 1963 with Loran Hall when they hocked a 30.06 rifle at a detective agency whose partners were Richard Hathcock and Roy B. Payne. With Hemming and Hall in this episode was a man who was described as having a Mohawk haircut, which matched the description that Silvia Odio had given of one of the two visitors with Oswald in that strange incident. This led the HSCA to be very curious about Hemming."},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"Gerry Patrick Hemming in front of White House while acting as temporary weekend courier between Annapolis and the CIA, August 1958."},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"Hemming at Marine Corp Air Station, Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, 1958.

This was independently confirmed in a similar story that Gerald Patrick Hemming had told Dick Russell, but Hemming did not mention Colonel William Bishop.

Five days later Hall went from Los Angeles to Dallas. Then, the day after the assassination an FBI agent came to the detective agency’s office to ask Roy Payne questions about himself and Loran Hall. Hathcock and Payne speculated that the reason the FBI had come to their office so quickly was that the fingerprints of Payne, who had handled the rifle while it was in hock at the agency, had been found on the rifle and somehow had linked it to the JFK assassination. But, as it turned out, the FBI’s visit to Hathcock’s office was probably precipitated by a gun theft report that Hemming had made to the Miami police in November 1963 when he discovered that Loran Hall had retrieved the rifle on his own. Hemming told me he that he feared Hall was going to use the rifle to frame him in Dallas in the JFK assassination, after which it would be “paper-trailed” back to his purchase in 1961 in Miami, but Hemming later found that the rifle was in Miami at the time of the assassination. [552] Hemming has stated to others, and confirmed to me in my interviews, that he met Oswald at the Cuban consulate in Monterey Park, California, when Oswald appeared unannounced from the Marine Corps Auxiliary Air Station (LTA) in Santa Ana, California, where Oswald was stationed at the time. (The Marine Corps Air Station is about forty-five miles from Monterey Park.) Oswald requested assistance from Hemming in defecting to Cuba to help Castro in the revolution. By that time Hemming had been discharged from the Marine Corps and had volunteered to join the Castro revolution to fight on Castro’s side. Hemming told me that Oswald had come back to the Cuban consulate three times after his first visit and had become a pest, insisting that he wanted to infiltrate Cuba. Hemming said that Oswald was always walking when he arrived at the consulate, so Hemming had a friend who was a barber in a shop down the street use binoculars to watch Oswald after he left the consulate. The barber saw that Oswald returned to a four-door car with military or police-type antennas and entered on the passenger side. Hemming said that Oswald seemed to know a lot about him that he shouldn’t have known unless he had been provided the information. So, on his own volition, Hemming went to the Marine Corps Air Station in Santa Ana and managed to finagle himself inside, where he located and confronted Oswald. They then went outside the station to a pizza parlor, where Hemming provided Oswald with paperwork and instructions about how to infiltrate Cuba. Hemming talked at length with me about Oswald. He seemed to be obsessed about him. He said that Oswald later showed up in Cuba to see him, but the contact was never made because the Cubans wouldn’t let Oswald stay in the country. Hemming said that he again encountered Oswald briefly in Miami on December 6, 1962 and that was the last time he ever saw him. There is some corroborative testimony to support, in part, Hemming’s story. Nelson Delgado, also a Marine at the Marine Corps Station in Santa Ana, California, told the Warren Commission that Oswald had told him that he had been in contact with the Cuban Consul in Los Angeles. Delgado said that he had heard that Oswald was seen talking for about two hours with a visitor outside the gate at the base. Delgado also testified that he had seen an official-looking envelope in Oswald’s wall locker, with a big impressive seal, Latin-looking, that he assumed was from the Cuban Consulate. He said that Oswald had told him before that he was receiving mail from them. [553] We shall see that Hemming voluntarily joined the Castro revolution [554] and he claims that Angleton knew about it in advance. Hemming also claims that he ultimately made direct contacts with Angleton at his home in Washington, D.C., concerning Cuban matters and anti-Castro activities. Evidence will show that Hemming was very likely a CIA covert asset, or could be perhaps more accurately described as a “singleton” CIA agent reporting back to Angleton at infrequent intervals when Hemming could get out of"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"Cuba. Hemming was born on March 1, 1937 in Los Angeles, California. At the time of the JFK assassination he was twenty-six years old. He joined the Marine Corps at the age of sixteen in April 1953 (using a false birth certificate) but was soon discharged in late summer 1953, then enlisted legally of age in April, 1954 and was finally discharged in 1958. He then joined Castro’s Cuban Revolutionary Army, serving between February 1959 and August 1960 (about eighteen months). During part of that time he was running an air base in Castro’s rebel air force until 1960. After being arrested twice by Castro’s forces under suspicion of counter-revolutionary activity, he was jailed, somehow got out, and lived in Havana where he was “underground” with both Major William Morgan’s group and with anti-Somoza Nicaraguans for three months. Morgan was ultimately executed by Castro forces for being a U.S. intelligence agent plotting against Castro’s life. It was in a Havana safe- house that Hemming met the anti-Somoza Nicaraguans, who later switched to backing Somoza. (Hemming told me that later he became involved in covert operations in Nicaragua.) Hemming left Cuba in 1960 for Mexico City, spent two weeks there, and returned to California where he contacted a CIA “Double 0” in Los Angeles and reported to him what he had learned thus far in Cuba. Hemming was a very unusual teenager. I didn’t learn this until after the second interview. He told me that as a youth he read an English/German version of Hitler’s Mein Kampf , thus learning to read German. And amazingly, as reported in The Los Angeles Times, at the age of fourteen Hemming had formed his own paramilitary operation consisting of a gang of five teenagers who accumulated an arsenal of twenty- nine rifles and handguns and three thousand rounds of ammunition by burglarizing three sporting goods stores in Los Angeles. They practiced guerrilla warfare in the Mojave Desert near Los Angeles, planning to become a young “John Dillinger gang” and commit a “blitz of robberies” in the San Marino and Alhambra areas. Fortunately the youthful gang was rounded up by the police and their adventure was ended. During this period Hemming would wear a Nazi youth uniform with a swastika emblem. [555] When I asked Hemming about these escapades he smiled wryly, “If you think that was dangerous, you should know what I did before I was fourteen years old”—disarming bombs using instructions from military manuals, as an example. In May 1961, after returning to Miami from Cuba, Hemming took over a group called the Anti- Communist Legionnaires. This group included Frank Sturgis (of Watergate fame), with whom Hemming said he parted company and took part of the group with him. The new group under Hemming soon was named Interpen. According to Hemming, the purpose of Interpen was “long range penetration and reconnaissance intelligence work,” mainly in Latin America. Additionally, Interpen offered protection services to Latin American officials (one service was for these officials to use Interpen as a threatening force to keep political foes in line), and trained guerrilla warriors. The enterprising Hemming relocated in May 1961 to a new site in the Florida Everglades until 1962, then moved to No Name Key in the Florida Keys where he trained Cubans and American volunteers in guerrilla warfare and assassination techniques. [556] It was Hemming’s group that was first suspected by Jim Garrison of being the assassination team that killed President Kennedy, but Garrison later dropped his suspicion for reasons not understood. One reason may have been that when Garrison started his investigation Hemming showed up in work boots and work clothes with his associate, Roy Hargraves, and volunteered to help Garrison conduct his investigation. Some researchers think that this was the beginning of the CIA’s penetration into Garrison’s investigation to undermine him. Others think the opposite: that Hemming turned Garrison’s attention to the CIA and kept it away from Carlos Marcello. Newspapers in Miami and New Orleans described Hemming as a handsome giant who looked like Errol Flynn, sporting a neat beard and an Australian bush hat. He was 6 feet 6 inches tall, had brown hair (sunbleached blond), and weighed 230 pounds (Hemming says 212 pounds). He was reported as being"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"capable of firing two heavy machine guns from the hips at the same time, cowboy style. (Hemming says that this was “no big deal—not necessary” and that “this Rambo cowboy stuff” was an insult to him.) He told me that he missed qualifying by two points for the Presidents One Hundred, the elite, top military rifle marksmen in the U.S. He said that as part of his basic training for qualifying in Special Forces he could fly almost all types of aircraft, maintain the aircraft; operate and maintain power boats; handle explosives, electronic communications, and underwater demolition; was an expert parachutist; an expert in assassination weapons and devices, and all the other things required to be top in his profession. After interviewing Hemming over five days (accumulating over thirty hours of tapes), I began to see him as an exceptionally talented person: brilliant, with an encyclopedic mind, excellent writing skills, and the intellect of a physicist despite having dropped out of high school in his junior year. He had an impressive knowledge of U.S. political history, the politics of Latin America, the anti-Castro Cuban community in the U.S., and the tradecraft, as it is known in the intelligence community. He displayed an in-depth knowledge of many aspects of the law, including constitutional law (when I met him in September 1996 he was working as a paralegal and private detective in Miami). I sensed that he possessed an enormous inner drive to do daring deeds, to be larger than life. (When Hemming reviewed this he noted that he preferred to be described as “having an interest in taking on calculated-risk jobs that necessitated special skills and experience.”) Hemming had a capacity for double-talk and cunning beyond anyone I had ever encountered. He also had a wide range of powerful emotions, from tears of anguish, to humor, to ferocious rage. This struck me as similar to Gary Shaw’s description of Colonel William Bishop: a complex, incredible person, driven by unfathomable forces. (I was never able to fully understand his mental makeup.) Hemming talked about his participation in the planning and direction of assassinations. His conversation ranged from refined to such profanity as to make a seasoned sailor a piker; it seemed to vary as his mood and purposes required. He could speak articulately with perfect grammar, or lapse into street talk at will. He could be charming and witty, or studied and calm, and then suddenly become frighteningly intimidating, towering over me and thrusting his face into mine with loud, angry outbursts. Hemming remarked that he was still alive because others considered him to be a dangerous person, “a real bad ass,” but he had never promoted that image. In 1982 Hemming was convicted of smuggling marijuana [557] from the Colombian Cartel into Florida and was sentenced to incarceration in the Florida State Penitentiary for thirty years plus five, to be served consecutively. (The penitentiary, a hellish place according to Hemming, was known as the “Rock” because it was a duplicate of Alcatraz.) He said that he served eight-and-a-half years on the chain gang before his release. During his trial (reported in the Miami Herald on February 12, 1982) Hemming, having been denied a private attorney, acted in his own defense, claiming that he was working for the FBI and the federal Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), explaining that the only way he could penetrate major drug-smuggling networks was to act as a smuggler himself. I went into this for several hours with Hemming and am inclined to believe that he indeed had gotten himself entangled as an undercover agent in DEA operations in which the concept was that “to beat them you have to join them”—making what Hemming called “controlled deliveries from Colombia to U.S. networks for bust at street wholesale levels,” the result being that some of the people who were involved got caught and were sometimes abandoned by the government. The primary intent of this chapter was to stay with my original reason for contacting Hemming: to follow the chain of evidence linking the Dallas right wing to the JFK assassination, starting with General Fabian Escalante’s statement about Felipe Vidal Santiago, which was independently corroborated by Colonel William Bishop and also by Hemming in his statements to Dick Russell. My interviews with Hemming consisted of several telephone calls and meetings in San Diego, Fort"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"Lauderdale, and Dallas. [558] Keep in mind that these interviews are an evolving discovery process, all of Hemming’s words not to be taken as Gospel. First Interview: August 28, 1996; Telephone After a few perfunctory comments we got down to business: Twyman: Gary Shaw sent me all of his original notes of interviews with Colonel Bishop and Bishop’s telephone cards. And I’ve been putting together a story on that. Hemming: Is this the same Bill Bishop that ran an enterprise down in Honduras during the ’70s? Twyman: It could be. John Adrian O’Hare is one of his names that he used to use. O’Hare ran an operation down in Florida.... Hemming: Well, I’d worked with Smith on that one. Kennard Smith [an investigator for Bud Fensterwald]. Twyman: Maybe you could tell me more about Vidal. Hemming: Did Fonzi tell you that I named my son after him? My son is Felipe Vidal Santiago Hemming. He’s up in New York right now. Twyman: Is that right? Did you know John Martino? Hemming: Yes, I’ve spent a lot of time with John. Twyman: Did you know Robert Hargraves? Hemming: Roy Hargraves. He left this address here three days ago. Roy Emory Hargraves. Twyman: According to Bishop’s statements in Shaw’s notes, there was a meeting between Vidal, Hargraves, and two others at General Edwin Walker’s house at about the time that Walker was shot at in Dallas. Hemming: In April of ’63. Twyman: It was at that time, and Vidal had been driven in a 1957 white Chevrolet out to Dallas, and that was the same make and model of a car in a photograph that was taken.... Hemming: Yes, with the license plate removed. That was the car that was loaned to Felipe by one of his brothers-in-law. Twyman: So you remember that car? Hemming: Oh, I remember the meeting. Twyman: You remember the meeting? Hemming: Yes. Twyman: Were you there at the meeting? Hemming: Yes. I introduced Felipe to the general. I’d already been dealing with the general for more than a year. Twyman: Bishop also mentioned meeting once with General Willoughby and General Walker. Hemming: Right. Twyman: Did you have anything to do with that meeting? Hemming: Yes. Willoughby was MacArthur’s intelligence chief.... Bishop passed away recently, didn’t he?"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":" Twyman: Yes, in 1992. Colonel Bishop told Gary Shaw about this Willoughby meeting about a week before he died. I seem to be coming to the conclusion of a conspiracy involving anti-Castro Cubans, the Texas right wing, and LBJ and Hoover. Hemming: It existed. But we’re not sure whether they were throwaways, fall guys, or decoys. Twyman: Who were the throwaways? Hemming: Those people who were being approached to do the job on Kennedy. We were all approached from 1962 on. The first thing was that they were trying to use us to do the job because we’d already been on the payroll for a couple of Latin American dictators for the same kind of work. I inherited the people from Frank Sturgis and then severed relations with him in 1961. And from that time forward Harvey was running ZR/RIFLE and General Lansdale was running Mongoose. The first direct approach was from some Texas people in 1962. We took a couple of these approaches very seriously because we were soliciting funds for operations inside Cuba, staying away from the coastal raid thing.... So in 1962 we were approached by some very serious people to forget all of the paramilitary or special-operations-type plans and go for terminating the leadership in Cuba. And in a very short time it shifted from the leadership in Cuba to the leadership in Washington —now we’re talking about the military and civilian people—we’re talking about people who wore civilian clothes but were from the Pentagon or reservists, or what have you, of General rank.... Twyman: Yes, Army reserves. Hemming: Right. And their usual retort was, “You’ve got a reputation for doing this kind of work and we wouldn’t be talking this bluntly unless we’d been over your files and this is your line of work, this is your specialty, and that’s why we’re making a direct approach and being rather frank and blunt about it.” But we still bowed out. Later in the spring of 1962 Guy Banister approached us when we were in New Orleans working with Larry LaBorde [559] on the training page camp at Pontchartrain, and he made the same approaches, the same offers, and he was turned down. Most of these people expected to be turned down because we didn’t know whether they were wearing a wire or not. It was just a formality to turn them down and then make preparations for cash transfers and what have you to make sure that the cutouts between the sponsor and the operators were completely severed at the appropriate time. [560] We were faced with that throughout 1962. We became very active in the summer of 1962. We were the only people who brought information out on the missiles. And of course we didn’t discover that until we were given information by Senator Keating. We brought in the governor of Florida and the governors of a couple of other southeastern states and we used Israeli contacts and others to determine that there were people in government such as Curtis LeMay and others that felt there was a possibility something was happening. But they were keeping JFK completely cut off from it, and their attitude was we can take ’em without suffering damage, that is, taking Cuba and the Soviet Union without suffering excessive damage in the United States, with a pre-emptive strike. Twyman: Well, in these meetings in Dallas...? Hemming: The meeting in Dallas was with Robert Morris at the Adolphus Towers, and this was preparatory to meeting with Bunker Hunt and Lester Logue and other people. Twyman: Did you ever meet with Bunker Hunt? "},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"Hemming: Oh, yes. I was the first one to establish contact for Cuba vis á vis the petroleum industry people and that came through my uncle who was a personal friend and former associate of John McCone. My uncle said to go out and see Bob Morris...well first I saw the president [D. B. Lewis] of Doctor Ross dog food in Los Angeles and he steered me to Morris. At that time I was dealing with Congressman Rousselot and he also steered me to Morris, and Morris was the cutout for meetings with Hunt and Logue and a number of other oil people. It also involved touching bases with de Mohrenschildt and some of the other people. They were running their own operation. Twyman: They had their own paramilitary operation? Hemming: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. But they weren’t going anywhere. They didn’t have the skill. Twyman: They had a group called the AVG? Hemming: Well that’s later on...that’s in the ’60s. That’s later...that originated in Tucson, Arizona. Twyman: Yes. Well what do you think finally happened? Hemming: First of May of 1963 I was in a meeting at John Martino’s house where money changed hands. Giancana was there. Chuck Nicoletti was there. Santo Trafficante was there. Charlie the Blade was there [Charles Tourine Sr., who had been in prison with Trafficante in Cuba]. And others. And it was for a hit on Fidel. I passed on $15,000 directly to Felipe Vidal that night and another $15,000 was given to Felipe directly by Martino the next day. And things got underway. [561] Twyman: But how did this convert into the Kennedy assassination? Hemming: Because that’s how they were steering it. Santo and those people were led to believe that the use of the Fidel thing was just a cover, a pseudonym for JFK. So you wouldn’t be talking; you would be dropping names of Fidel. And the teams would believe that they were on an operation. The way a team is placed in position, you could put them in Mexico City and they’d think they were in Havana; you could put ‘em in Kansas City and they’d think they were in Havana, or on the outskirts. Twyman: You mean they went in blindfolded? Hemming: Well, they’re taken in at night and they have absolutely no idea where they are. They are put in a couple of safehouses, near the scene of the killing zone, and they do the job and get the hell out. They’re not allowed to know where they’re at, in case they had friends or if they tried to E&E...escape and evade...they would suddenly resort to their own knowledge of the real estate rather than going to the proper safehouses when the thing starts coming apart. Plus they would feel insecure if things start coming apart—that they were going to be eliminated. So they’re not left to their own devices. They’re completely under control. That’s the standard tradecraft. Twyman: Was Texas oil money passed in this meeting at Martino’s house? Hemming: No, this is separate. This is mob money from the Teamsters pension. This is Hoffa money. Then the next money came from Micky Cohen on the West Coast and Jack Dragna, representing the LA mob; Willie Bioff. Money came from Vegas. And it went to Marcello. Twyman: How did the Texas right wing fit into this? Hemming: That had nothing to do with the Marcello operation at all. Twyman: Or the Kennedy assassination?"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":" Hemming: Of course they did. But we had separate teams for the same job. We had a French team that worked in the Dominican Republic and Montreal. We had a team that was organized by Papa Doc [François Duvalier, dictator of Haiti]. Okay? A team organized by Ramfis Trujillo, the son of the dictator [Rafael Trujillo, Dominican Republic] assassinated by Kennedy’s people, as he believed it. There were a number of people out there, including people in Lisbon that supported the OAS, who saw Kennedy as the same threat as far as the Algerian problem as de Gaulle was. So you have a number of teams, well financed, and the big thing is that if you’re in the business and you have a target, you find out if there are other paying enemies [of JFK] that could be brought in and it increases your venture capital. Twyman: Could they be brought in as covers too? Hemming: They always are. This models up the MOs [ modus operandi ] and also their people that are linked directly to powerful people, like LBJ and others who are intentionally put there so there will be a cover-up...there will be a confusion as to who the assassins and sponsors were, what they were doing. So many leads are given that are decoys and strays that when they finally get to somebody who could be proven to be a principal, an aider and abettor, they bypass them because they think there’s just more decoys or strangers or loners. Twyman: This French OAS connection—was that Jean Souetre? Hemming: Yes. They were car bomb specialists and they had a vehicle laden with explosives on the other side of the underpass. Twyman: Then there are the FBI documents that Souetre or somebody using his name was in the Dallas area then. But who was actually behind the picket fence doing the shooting? Hemming: That’s a little more difficult. Those are the super-pros. Twyman: What about shots from the front? You know, from the grassy knoll? Hemming: Well that’s the team.... Those are the primary people.... Twyman: They were the backup team...? Hemming: Well, we don’t have those teams connected. Twyman: You haven’t been able to identify who they were yet? Hemming: We’ve identified two of them. One of them is dead, as far as the School Book Depository. The grassy knoll is still a blank. The one thing we do know is none of the teams knew the existence of the others.... This is how I worked with Oliver Stone on the movie. [562] I said, when they heard the shots, they would flinch because they weren’t sure that they’d been spotted and somebody was trying to take them out. And I said you can put a smile on the shooter’s face because then he realizes that it’s a super- pro job and there are backup and decoy teams and that’s where those shots are coming from. Silencers were used extensively. These were sionic silencers purchased through Mitchell Werbell. Twyman: What about sabot bullets? Hemming: Well that’s what we call a “meat” shot. Putting the shot into the target’s back. It’s not a lethal shot. If you want a shot that gives you a pristine bullet, that gives it to you. Twyman: Does that explain the shallow back wound? Kennedy’s shallow back wound? Hemming: Yes. And the angle, 44°."},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":" Twyman: From a tall building? Hemming: From above. Twyman: Yes, not from the School Book Depository. Hemming: Not likely...they’d of had to shoot through the trees. Twyman: Have you gone into the Steve Rivele interviews of the French Connection? Hemming: I’ve got the whole file. I’ve talked to a guy that’s down in Vegas right now that was a cellmate with Christian David. Twyman: Do you think there’s any credence to that? Hemming: Oh, yes. These are your backup teams and your decoys.... The interesting thing is how they were recruited and all that. We’ve identified the recruiter. He died three years ago. And he was in a business before. One of his last big jobs was Archbishop Romero in El Salvador. He engineered that. He attempted to recruit me for it—knew that job. So these people were busy and known before, and have kept up the good work since then. Twyman: Did you know David Morales? Hemming: Yes, I’d run into him. Twyman: And he worked with David Atlee Phillips on some of these South American jobs? Hemming: These are all disinformation bits that’s common in the business. Twyman: Disinformation? You mean Morales was not one of the CIA assassination specialists? Hemming: I can’t discount it completely, but at that point in time he was working under Jake Esterline [Pentagon staff officer] and JM/WAVE, and it’s very possible that they were monitoring, just as Richard Case Nagell. He [Nagell] was a Soviet agent, and the Soviets were trying to use Nagell and others to stop the assassination. Twyman: I talked to Nagell right before he died. Hemming: Russell could never really get out the fact that the guy had betrayed his country. But like Pollard it was a controlled defection. Nagell was strictly under Jim Angleton’s [counter-intelligence] control. Twyman: Did you ever meet Nagell? Hemming: Yes. Twyman: When he was down there investigating Alpha 66? Hemming: He was down there doing a job for the Soviets. And we found out who he was right away. Angleton tipped me off. Twyman: Do you think Oswald was an Angleton operation? Hemming: When Oswald showed up at the Cuban consulate in Monterey Park, I called my contact number for Angleton. I didn’t get him directly. I didn’t talk to Angleton until I flew out to Anacostia about a week later, after I’d already dealt with Oswald two or three times and visited him at the base, LTA in Santa Ana. And then when I got to Anacostia I dealt directly with Angleton, and I said you put in a counterpart on me and I don’t want you putting a counterpart on me. I’m going to Cuba right now. I don’t need some clown that I’ve never dealt with regardless of the fact that he’s had similar training as me and all that. It would be too risky to do this kind of thing. And he swore that Oswald was not a counterpart for me. And that he was not controlling Oswald. Well, that’s later. [563] But at that point in time he just said “No, I’ve no plans.” In fact he"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"warned me once again about the federal statutes I was violating and that I was on my own...as a singleton. Twyman: Who do you think was the mastermind, if there was one, behind the plot? One man who put it all together? Hemming: Hoover. That’s why Sullivan had to go. I don’t think even think Tolson or DeLoach knew about it. Hoover was monitoring it. So at any point in time he could put a stop to it. I think Magruder and Hoover and others got together and decided he [JFK] had to go. Twyman: Magruder? Hemming: Yes. General [John] Magruder. He ran the strategic services unit. He was the competitor to the CIA. That’s military intelligence. That’s your gestapo in this country. Twyman: What about Willoughby? Hemming: Willoughby worked for Magruder. Twyman: Willoughby worked for H. L. Hunt too. Hemming: [Colonel] Bishop worked for Magruder too. Just like Harvey. Harvey worked both sides. He worked in direct contact with Sullivan and Hoover, and while he was on the CIA payroll. A lot of these people had different loyalties because back in World War II they’d excluded OSS from the western hemisphere, so it was the FBI guys that had all the intell for the western hemisphere when CIA and INR and the State Department picked ’em up. Twyman: Do you think Harvey could have been the one who put together the plot for Hoover? Hoover’s mastermind? Hemming: Oh, yes. But Harvey wouldn’t be the key guy. [Charles] Siragusa in the Federal Bureau of Narcotics is the key guy. Siragusa was the top agent in the Federal Bureau of Narcotics who did this kind of work. Twyman: Did he have the expertise to put together a sophisticated plan like that? Hemming: Oh, yes. The only agency in the federal government, even to this date, that maintains an assassination capability is the narcotics people. They have to to stay alive. Twyman: I noticed in Harvey’s notes that he mentions Siragusa. He wrote, “What does Siragusa know?” Hemming: Yes, he’s the mastermind for the hit team. Narcotics is the only way to be on top of intell around the world because you’ve got everybody on your payroll and anything that moves you know about it. And most people cooperate with the dopers because they don’t see them as being political or anything, or even being a security threat. Twyman: Yes. Now Hoover was very close to H. L. Hunt. Hemming: Oh, yes. Twyman: And of course Hunt was close to LBJ. And the three of those together made a pretty powerful combination. Hemming: But I don’t see them sitting around with a tableful of snacks discussing this kind of business. They’re using cutouts to communicate. They’re not talking directly.... Hoover’s biggest problem was he kind of took some things personal against me. He had attempted to blackmail Bobby Kennedy and our liaison (we had a liaison with Bobby Kennedy)...and we proceeded to get photographs and information that compromised Hoover, delivered them to Bobby Kennedy, and he turned the tables on Hoover. Hoover"},{"pageNumber":509,"pageContent":"found out who had supplied the information so we were number one on Hoover’s list from ’62 onward.... Twyman: This compromising information. Was that about his sexual...? Hemming: His boyfriend in Chicago was [name withheld by author].... We’ve got the photographs. Twyman: What ever happened to them? Hemming They’re around. Right now we’re in the process of going back in to see what can be done with the confidential files that were seized. There are tremendous blackmail possibilities there even at this date. So it’s a sensitive thing. All of these confidential files were seized and then sealed by people that I worked with. Twyman: Now when you say “we,” who do you mean? Hemming: An anonymous team. We’re known as the Interpen bunch and we even have decoys built into that. [564] Twyman: What’s the purpose of the team? To solve the JFK assassination mystery? Hemming: No. Get back at the bastards that tried to set us up as the assassins. They didn’t just recruit us, they recruited us to be fall guys. We were supposed to go down under the gun in Miami International Airport [on November 18, 1963] because that was one of the primary sites for the assassination. We didn’t appreciate their efforts. [This is an adamant point with Hemming—that the FBI and/or MI tried to set him up to be killed in a firefight in the Miami airport. He says that Howard K. Davis and Roy Hargraves will confirm this. Researcher Gordon Winslow says research of photos at the airport do not show Hemming or his group at the event.] Twyman: And who would these bastards be? Hemming: That’s what we’re still working on. I went to work to help get some blackmailers off of Marcello’s back. I worked to get blackmailers off a number of the Texas people’s back that were being blackmailed by people that actually believe that they participated. Twyman: Who participated? Hemming: The shooters. Some of the shooters. Some of the assassins that were in the area at the time and were in Chicago and were in Miami attempted to get more money because they were promised more money, they were blackmailing people that had put up money for the job, and it was my job in the late ’60s and ’70s to prove that these people didn’t do the job and didn’t have the money coming. Twyman: Well, I can see where the anti-Castro Cubans could have people in your Interpen group who could have felt they had been set up. Hemming: All of them. All of them, including Felipe, knew we’d been set up. Twyman: Do you think these people who were behind all this are still very powerful and very deadly? Hemming: They never stopped doing their work. It’s a continuous event. You see, people don’t understand. The coup didn’t occur in November. The coup had already occurred before the inauguration. Kennedy never took power as the president. He never functioned as the real president. This is what Eisenhower was warning about. They’d done the same thing to him. They’d caused him to cease functioning as a president himself. Twyman: The military-industrial complex?"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":" Hemming: That’s what he called it. The prime financiers were the weapons manufacturers, Hanford and Rocky Flat’s people. They put up the biggest bucks. Twyman: You mean they joined forces even with the Texas right-wing oil people? Hemming: Oh no, these are independent operations. Twyman: So there are two independent operations between the Texas group and the others? Hemming: No, you have a multiple of independent operations (Ramfis Trujillo, Papa Doc).... They financed the movement of people, the equipment, the setting up of teams, so that if it went down in Miami it would be a particular team that was unknown to the other teams. If it went down in Chicago or in Tampa or in San Antonio or in Dallas, these were totally separate financed teams, financed by different sponsors. Twyman: But all emanating from some central group? Hemming: All monitored from very powerful people.... Twyman: Then this powerful group goes beyond the CIA? Hemming: Oh, yes. Oh, yes [laughs]. You won’t find it printed anywhere. Twyman: But one of the problems is that what you talk about is so fantastic that it becomes unbelievable. Hemming: Unless you’ve been in the business, you will never understand. It’s family tradecraft. It is devious. You almost have to develop a criminal mind to understand it. Most of these things were developed by the Soviets. And most of them to perfection and great remuneration. Billions of dollars by the narcotics people. They have to be the best in the business. Twyman: The joint ventures of intelligence and narcotics in siphoning off of money for covert operations? That money must stick to some of the people’s hands personally too. Hemming: That’s the only incentive. You put your ass on the line. That was one of the things I specialized in the ’70s. If you’re a gunrunner, you have an in at the palace level throughout the planet. If you’re a doper, you have control of the palace level in every country throughout the planet. Twyman: You have the opportunity of getting rich too? Hemming: Oh, yes. Twyman: Why do you think that William Pawley committed suicide? Hemming: Same cop [hit man] that did Bill Pawley did President Prio. This was a hit. He knew it was coming, too. He’d been convinced that his participation had gone awry and that he’d become a traitor to his own country. Anybody who takes up arms against the executive is a traitor. You attempt to assassinate a president, you’re a traitor to your country. It’s high treason. Twyman: Let’s go back to these meetings in Dallas with General Walker. It just seems amazing, these meetings. You were there. Vidal was there. And Bishop was there. Hemming: Not all at once, though. Twyman: Not all at once. And discussions were held on assassinating Kennedy. I don’t think I got it clear yet what you believe the purpose of these meetings were. Were they actually to recruit you or to set you up? Hemming: We never determined what. But we always treated them as a genuine operation when they were going down."},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":" Twyman: But they didn’t materialize? There was no agreement reached? Hemming: No, the problem with Walker was we dealt with him during the missile crisis and then the situation we were working on in the missile crisis was disrupted by James Meredith going in to Old Miss [University of Mississippi]. So here’s Walker getting himself to doing the Old Miss situation which tended to alienate the Cubans from him. Because now he was a racist. So now we had a problem even having Walker involved. We had a number of former first Special Service force people in the loop, and of course Walker had a bad reputation while he was in the Devil’s Brigade as being a homosexual, and then in some of these meetings a couple of my people made rather frank comments in his living room about his boyfriends coming down the staircase and all that. So it was a situation where Walker would be the military guy that stood in front of the John Birchers (very few of the John Birchers would put their money where their mouth was), and Walker could be utilized to head up a special campaign and that the funding would come from the right wing and they would accomplish certain goals, and that was it. But as far as participation in operations, Walker excluded himself from that. Twyman: So you don’t think he was involved in the JFK assassination? Hemming: Oh, there’s a high possibility that he was. But to that point in time we were kind of loosening our contacts with him. Our last contact with Walker was July 4, 1963 when we flew out there for a meeting. Twyman: That’s you and Vidal? Hemming: No, Howard Davis. [565] Twyman: Howard Davis and you? Hemming: Right. And we were somewhat chagrined that Walker would be so careless when we talked to the wee hours of the morning, ’til 5:00 in the morning, and this was after a shot has been fired through his window and he doesn’t even draw the drapes. Twyman: This is right after that shot? Hemming: Yes, this is July. And we thought, well, this is piss-poor tradecraft here because he’s either a total nut and he’s not keeping his cover up, because we figured he engineered the thing him-self...and that if ever important people had heard by a chance remark that he spent hours, in the wee hours of the morning, with his blinds open, it would cause suspicions to go back against him as having himself engineered the attempt. And that kind of turned us off too, because he wasn’t even conscious of the fact that whether you’re brave or not you always draw your curtains, especially after you’ve been shot at. It’s impolite to have your guests exposed to the risk. Twyman: So, in those meetings, Walker talked about assassination of Kennedy? Hemming Not directly, no. Twyman: Not directly. Did you have meetings with H. L. Hunt? Hemming: Yes, these things... the code word at that point in time, post-missile crisis, seemed to be to hit on Fidel, don’t bother about commando operations or any of this kind of business. We’ll put our money into taking out the top people in Cuba. We don’t want to hear about anything else. Twyman: But the code was Fidel equals JFK? Hemming: Exactly."},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":" Twyman: I’ll of course want to write about all this. Hemming: Yes, I was going to do a book two years ago, spent months with an author, just to have threats made to various publishers. Throughout the interview, Hemming talked unhesitatingly and naturally, indicating to me that he was either very candid or had carefully outlined everything he was going to say. He used none of the profanity for which he is renowned, and was generally very articulate and responsive. This would change in the face-to-face interviews. To deal with this flood of material, I decided to do what I’ve done before for reaching conclusions: I would use for conclusions only the material that could be corroborated with other evidence. But I would report other relevant material and let the reader use his or her own judgment as to what to do with it. For this first interview, the directly useful material boiled down to the following: (1) Hemming’s confirmation of his statement to Dick Russell in 1992 that Felipe Vidal traveled to Dallas in the week before the assassination and attended a meeting with wealthy Dallas businessmen (the Hunts), who did not want to discuss “operational plans.” (2) Hemming’s confirmation of the white 1957 Chevrolet in which Vidal was driven to Dallas, thus further substantiating Vidal’s visit with Walker and bringing Vidal into the Walker shooting incident. (3) Hemming’s statements concerning General Walker’s staging of the shooting incident in April 1963, adding believability to the suspicion that it was staged. (4) Hemming’s acknowledgment that he knew Colonel William Bishop. (5) Hemming’s acknowledgment that he himself attended some of these meetings in Dallas mentioned by Colonel Bishop, and also attended a meeting with John Martino, Vidal, Sam Giancana, Chuck Nicoletti, and Santo Trafficante in Miami in which Hoffa money was exchanged. This is consistent with Florence Martino’s statements and FBI reports in the preceding chapter, as well as the evidence of Giancana’s and Trafficante’s involvement in the assassination. (By “consistent” I mean that Mrs. Martino stated to the HSCA that her husband knew Gerry Hemming, and an FBI report confirmed Vidal’s relationship with John Martino. ) As the interview came to an end, I invited him to visit San Diego for an extended face-to-face interview. I offered him the option of my going to Florida or paying the expenses for him to come to San Diego. He chose to come to San Diego, saying that he hadn’t seen two of his brothers (who lived in Pomona, California) for many years and would take advantage of being in California to visit them. I offered to rent him a hotel room or have him stay as a guest at my home. Hemming chose to be a house guest, saying it would give us time to talk over more extended periods. Before proceeding with the second interview, some background on Roy Hargraves and Felipe Vidal will be useful: Roy Emory Hargraves was born on February 14, 1940 in St. Louis, Missouri. He was only twenty- three years old at the time of the JFK assassination. Dade County, Florida police records dated March 2, 1965 describe Hargraves as “5-10\" tall, white male, 165 pounds, hazel eyes and brown hair.” FBI records [566] show a long string of arrests starting when Hargraves was seventeen years old. The first arrest charge was “AWOL/escape from Lackland Air Force Base, confinement 9 months.” More arrests and/or incarcerations continued through 1958 to 1963, for burglary, grand theft, shoplifting, vagrancy, and violation of U.S. Neutrality Act and violation of National Firearms Act. His occupation was listed as “decorator.” The grand theft arrests resulted in sentencing to prison in Arizona for 2 to 3 years. He next appeared in the records arrested in June 1960 for burglary. The arrests for violation of U.S. Neutrality Act and National Firearms Act were in 1962 and 1963 after he became associated with Hemming in a"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"patriotic crusade, CIA sanctioned, to topple Castro. In 1968/’69, Hargraves became known as the “Mad Bomber” for bombing both the SDS Peace Center and the Black Panther Headquarters in Los Angeles as part of Operation CHAOS which, according to Hemming, was an illegal CIA covert program to disrupt radical, subversive elements in Los Angeles. Hemming was also involved in this program. [567] A CIA document dated February 10, 1965 has some interesting material concerning Felipe Vidal and Roy Hargraves and their association with the CIA: T he following is a brief resume of this Agency’s relationship with Felipe Carlos VIDAL Santiago: In October 1959 VIDAL arrived in Caracas, Venezuela as the Cuban Naval Attache. In January 1960 a representative of this Agency contacted VIDAL when it became known he was disaffected with the CASTRO regime. VIDAL defected from his position on 7 March 1960 and fled to Bogota, Colombia. A POA was granted to VIDAL on 15 March 1960 and this was later superseded by a CSA granted on 27 October 1960. This Agency planned to utilize VIDAL as Chief of the FRD Maritime Force. It was later learned VIDAL was an opportunist and associated with people whom this Agency frowned upon. He was considered a security risk and interest in him was terminated in August 1961. VIDAL then aligned himself with various exile groups, notably the Frente Liberacion Nacional (FLN). VIDAL appeared before the INS on numerous occasions for violations committed while engaging in anti CASTRO activities with the various exile groups. On one occasion he related to the INS and the FBI that he was at one time a CIA agent and furnished them some background information regarding his activities while working for us. While attempting to infiltrate Cuba in March 1964 he was captured. He was executed by the GOC on 26 May 1964. At no time after August 1961 was this Agency affiliated with VIDAL. There is no record that this Agency ever utilized the services of Roy Emory Hargraves. He may well have infiltrated Cuba on 22 October 1962 as he claims and also trained some men in VIDAL’s organization, but this was neither a CIA mission nor CIA men that he claims to have trained. [568] The foregoing indicates that Vidal was recruited by the CIA and became a CIA agent after he had defected from the Cuban Navy. The FLN, a radical anti-Castro Cuban organization, was created by Vidal, according to Hemming, against the CIA’s wishes. Whether or not Vidal left the CIA must be taken with a grain of salt. We may be seeing some distancing here by the CIA from that radical group, in contemplation of future black operations. Interview in San Diego: September 20-23, 1996 When I met Hemming as he came off the American Airlines flight in San Diego, I was struck by a look of sensitivity and intelligence in his face. Based on what I had heard about him, I expected to see a very rough character, á la Hells Angels bikers. But although Hemming now weighed 300 pounds and was 6 feet 5 inches tall and had a gray beard and pony tail, his facial expression could very well have been that of a weathered, overweight aerospace engineer about to retire after a long and difficult career. His demeanor was not that of a violent, cruel person. Hemming brought with him about one hundred pages of FBI and CIA documents, mostly negative"},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"about him, that he had received from the National Archives and other researchers. Other material he brought he had received from A. J. Weberman, who had put the material on the Internet. He also lugged a stack of newspaper clippings about the JFK assassination and about himself. None of the government documents tended to exonerate him; on the contrary, they tended to implicate him in the JFK conspiracy. Hemming later noted that the reason he was giving me this material was to show that in November 22, 1963, the U.S. government had more than enough on file to indict himself and others for the JFK assassination. Fonzi had told me that Weberman had written a gigantic, unpublished book on the JFK assassination, focusing primarily on Hemming, in which he claimed that Hemming and his Interpen group were heavily involved in the JFK assassination. (Hemming had told me that Weberman put the database for this book on the Internet.) So Hemming brought with him the Weberman material that he had been able to obtain. I later hard-copied more than 4,000 pages largely pertaining to Hemming in which Weberman accused him of committing two murders of his past associates (Larry LaBorde and Edwin Collins). He accused Hemming of acting as Oswald’s handler in the JFK assassination: (a) flying Oswald from New Orleans to Austin to Dallas and to Mexico City, thus accommodating his visit to Silvia Odio (b) manipulating Oswald into buying the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle and bringing it into the School Book Depository (c) practicing on the rifle range in Dallas with Oswald and collecting the spent shells to plant in the School Book Depository (d) being the person who set up the staged shot at General Walker. In addition, Weberman indirectly involved Hemming in the assassination of Martin Luther King through Hemming’s Interpen group, and much more—if one can imagine it. Weberman’s audacious act of putting this database on the World Wide Web must have been a shock. Hemming said that the number of hits on this Web site was an all-time high. Hemming now found himself with all of this explosive, accusatory information stored somewhere in a giant computer that was sending it to orbiting satellites, then broadcasting it down to Internet users in every remote corner of the earth! I wondered if perhaps Hemming was exercising damage control in meeting with me. What was he up to? Was this a “limited hangout”? (Hemming noted: “It was in order to bring the JFK traitors to justice...”) I had decided ahead of time that this would be a long interview with no organization to it—just rambling conversations, getting acquainted, exchanging ideas, and seeing what came of it as we focused on the Kennedy assassination. The weekend started out calmly. But as time went by Hemming got on an emotional roller coaster and would express extreme anger at those who had “set him up”; he said his mission in life was to get even with them and expose the plot and the cover-up so as to prevent it from repeating. I admonished him to stop thinking about revenge, but he said he had to do it. He gradually got off that track as the weekend progressed. I must state that at this point I did not seriously consider Hemming to be a prime suspect in the Kennedy assassination, notwithstanding Weberman’s allegations. But over the weekend, my suspicion that Hemming was involved in the assassination grew from nil until finally, when he left, I had become half- convinced that Weberman was right. However, I had developed a compassion for Hemming; he was a very human and likable person. I experienced the beginning of a sympathetic understanding of how he got where he now is, in a horrible dilemma. The conversation over the three-day weekend was partly taped, partly recorded in handwritten notes, and very voluminous; therefore far too much to relate in detail. What follows is a condensation of the most important points. But first we will examine the essence of the documents that Hemming brought with him, which form an evidentiary foundation for Hemming’s statements concerning his and Vidal’s trips to Dallas in 1963, and their peripheral involvement in the JFK assassination, if not deeper. We will begin by focusing on a handwritten document summarizing CIA and FBI documents. I asked"},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"Gaeton Fonzi to review it to check its authenticity with his past associates in the HSCA. [569] While he was doing that, I proceeded with the analysis that follows. The document consisted of forty-seven pages with a cover sheet entitled Select Committee on Assassinations, U.S. House of Representatives. It is a chronology prepared about Hemming and his interrelated activities, cross-referencing to Loran Hall, Lawrence Howard, and William Seymor. The document cites sources in a variety of secret or confidential FBI and CIA documents pertaining to Vidal, Hargraves, and others. I was startled to see that reference was made in one instance to “Volume IX of the Hemming material.” Fonzi later told me that he never knew of nine volumes on Hemming, despite the fact that he was the HSCA investigator assigned to investigate him! Fonzi was dismayed by this. Obviously there was extensive material that the HSCA deliberately kept from Fonzi and filed away in secrecy. This only served to reinforce my growing feeling that Hemming was indeed a very important character in the JFK assassination. One of the first items to strike the eye in the documents is this entry: 12/17/63: Vidal claims close association with Roy Emory Hargraves. Claims press & left in U.S. supports Manuel Ray Rivero & Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo. Claims CIA responsible for commandos L raid in March 1963 which attacked and sunk Russian ship BAKU off the north shore of Cuba. CIA used raid as an excuse to stop all further attacks against Cuba by anti-Communist Cubans in the U.S. Vidal visited Dallas 2 weeks before the assassination, stayed 5 days, and spoke with General Walker to get his views on the Cuban situation. Walker was not interested in involving himself with Cuban revolutionary activities as he was running for governor. Miami Herald article cited, 1/6/64; reporting fire and sinking of boat—FON JAYS 25 miles SE of Miami, 1/5/64, with Dickey Chapell, Edward [Edwin] Collins, and Roy Hargraves aboard. They were rescued by Vidal. Chapell—freelance [female] journalist. Arrested 10/21/63 with 21 members of anti-Castro group headed for Cuba. Hargraves—associate of Hemming; soldier of fortune. Hemming said to have been instigator of 1/5/64 attempt to land on Cuba. What we have here is precise confirmation of Vidal’s visit to Dallas in early November 1963 as described by General Escalante, the only difference being that Escalante said Vidal stayed four days, whereas the document says five days. We also have confirmation of Vidal’s relationship with Roy Hargraves, Edward Collins, and Hemming, as well as Vidal’s heroic exploits. (In our conversations, Hemming described Vidal as an extremely impressive person who looked like the movie actor Ricardo Montalban. Hemming said that Vidal impressed the people in Dallas as well as everyone around him.) The next item that caught my attention was this: 6/14/63: Lauchli—Ford station wagon—load of arms from Collinsville, Ill. Lauchli escorted by Hemming, Sturgis to meet different Cuban exile leaders in Miami. This entry links Hemming to Richard Lauchli, who was national cofounder of the Minutemen. It also shows Hemming’s involvement in supplying weapons to Cuban exiles and his continuing contact with Frank Sturgis as late as June 14, 1963. This seems to belie Hemming’s statement to me that he “severed"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"the relationship” with Sturgis in 1961. (He later told me that Sturgis just “showed up,” which upset him, but he went along with the deal anyway.) Hemming left with me a copy of a letter to him from Richard Lauchli, obviously a friendly letter indicating a long-term relationship; also he left a letter written to him from Mitchell WerBell, the infamous assassination weapons specialist and arms dealer. We shall see that there is no question that Hemming was very closely linked with the entire gamut of right-wing extremists in the U.S. in 1963. This includes the John Birch Society in California with people like John Roussoulet and D. B. Lewis; the Hunt family in Dallas; General Walker and Lester Logue in Dallas (all associated with the John Birch Society); extending to Guy Banister in New Orleans (a member of the Minutemen) and the extreme right-wing factions of the Cuban exiles in Miami. We shall also see that Hemming’s contacts included high-level officials in the State Department and a U.S. Marine Corps general stationed in the White House, not to mention James Angleton, head of CIA counter-intelligence. Also, Hemming later told me that he had numerous contacts with William Harvey. And, as previously noted, Hemming had contacts with Sam Giancana, Chuck Nicoletti, Santo Trafficante, John Martino, and William Pawley. More can be listed. I marveled at this: Nowhere in the JFK assassination literature have I found one person with all of these associations that link to the JFK assassination plot, either directly or indirectly. The next items of interest are dated July 1962: LaBorde contacted owner of “Elsie Reichert” 65—located... [New Orleans]. Boat owned by 3 young Americans—Jack LNU and 2 others who live and work on it. LaBorde wants boat for mother ship for operations off Cuba. Need Cuban for captain to be operated in Cuban waters. “Mariner” located at Fort Myers, Florida, with 3 young Americans—motor damaged. Hemming & LaBorde expected to go there to confer with these Americans. LaBorde staying with Hemming at 2753 N.W. 13th St., Miami, and constantly traveling between Miami and New Orleans. LaBorde angry at crew of “Mariner” for not having arrived in Miami. 7/5 Informative note—Domestic Intelligence Division—Baggs may be making inquiry into CIA operations among Cubans in Miami... On behalf of White House. We will not make any check into this matter but will furnish attached data to the Attorney General for his information. Handwritten note: “OK. but this is astounding.” 7/21 News article—New Orleans States Item indicates set up of base—Lake Pontchartrain by Hemming—stopped by CRC. The significance of the first paragraph, “LaBorde contacted owner of Elsie M. Reichert...boat owned by 3 young Americans—Jack LNU [last name unknown] and two others...,” links LaBorde to a Jack Lawrence (the LNU). According to Hemming, this was the same Jack Lawrence who worked at the downtown Lincoln-Mercury agency in Dallas from which an Oswald impersonator test-drove an expensive automobile two weeks before the assassination, first mentioned in Chapter 17. In my attempts at brevity in Chapter 17, I had discounted the significance of Jack Lawrence. He was a temporarily employed car salesman at the Downtown Lincoln-Mercury Agency who called the Dallas police after the assassination to tell them about the Oswald driving incident that had occurred earlier in the month at the agency. It was later reported that Lawrence had hurriedly come into the agency about thirty minutes after the assassination, pale, sweating profusely, out of breath, and with mud on his clothes, and had run into the restroom and vomited. His car reportedly was found parked behind the picket fence"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"on the grassy knoll. [570] It was later discovered that Jack Lawrence stayed at the same YMCA in Dallas at which Oswald had stayed (see footnote on page 698), and had worked at an auto agency in New Orleans before coming to Dallas. [571] This document confirms Hemming’s close relationship with Larry LaBorde. They were staying together at the same address in July 1962. Recall that in our first interview Hemming said that LaBorde was with him at a meeting in 1962 in New Orleans with Guy Banister when Banister made an offer (to Hemming) for a contract to kill JFK. Also of interest is the reference to “Baggs” (Bill Baggs, editor of the Miami News ), who was conducting an inquiry into CIA operations among Cubans and others in Miami on behalf of the White House, working with the domestic intelligence division of the CIA. The document reports that this meeting included Hemming, Hargraves, LaBorde, Eduardo Perez (a.k.a. Bayo), Tony Cuesta, Ramon Font, Tony Farinas, Hal Hendrix, Theodore Racoosin, and others. As we shall see, Hemming was deeply involved in virtually all aspects of the anti-Castro Cuban operations including direct contacts with military and government officials in Washington, D.C. The next item, dated December 1962: 12/2 Rented 35-ft. boat for expedition to Cuba with 12 men. “Sally”—Hemming purchased 55 gallon drum for fuel. 12/4 Hargraves and 12 American adventurers arrested by U.S. border patrol for violation of neutrality act. Preparatory raid on Cuba. Hemming arrested also—at dock at Marathon, FL. Report—arrest of Hemming and 12 men for attempting to illegally export arms (U.S. customs arrest). Later dismissed by U.S. District ET Judge, Miami, FL, because Justice failed to go ahead with prosecution. This illustrates Hemming’s continued anti-Castro activities and his association with Roy Hargraves. Note that although Hemming and twelve others were arrested for violations of the neutrality act and illegally exporting arms, it was dismissed by the U.S. Justice Department (then under Robert Kennedy) because “Justice failed to go ahead with prosecution.” This tends to support Hemming’s claim that he was operating under U.S. government approval. Now we have an item that commands close attention, dated January 1963: 1/20-22 Hemming & [Loran] Hall visit Dallas—Wallace Welch reporting—Hemming violently anti-Castro because wife in prison there. Accompanied them to [General] Walker’s home, talked in general terms about international situation. Walker advised against overt action—better to educate public. Hall apparently “hanger on” to Hemming. 1/23 Report—Hemming reluctantly went back to California [for his father’s funeral]. Hall and Hemming due to return 2/24. 1/23 Report—Hemming purchased [not clear] ammunition in Tampa [not clear] expect arrive in Miami. 1/24 Will office at 160 SW 16th Ave. (office of John Birch Society). This shows Hemming and Loran Hall visiting Dallas with “Wallace Welch reporting.” As Hemming had told me, Wallace Welch was one of his contacts in Dallas; Welch appears to be an FBI informant. Hemming was apparently being tracked very closely in every step he took. Here we have Hemming and Loran Hall visiting General Walker’s house. This fits with Hemming’s statements to me concerning his visit to Walker’s house at a later date in 1963. Also it shows the relationship of Hemming to Loran Hall, which, as we have noted, figures prominently in this story. During my interviews, Hemming was"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"consistently adamant that Loran Hall was instrumental in trying to “set him up” in the JFK assassination. Hemming’s whirlwind travels continue. In a March 8, 1963 entry: 3/8 Report—Hemming had been in Washington for 7 or 8 days previously returning this date or 3/7. While in Washington reportedly helped by Sterling Cottrell, Undersecretary of State for Cuban Affairs—and Marine Corps general stationed at White House. This is reinforced in a March 1963 entry: Report that Hemming in Washington, D.C., from approx Feb 6 to March 7 or 8—Allegedly visited a great number of people in State Department, Pentagon, i.e., Sterling Cottrell. Particularly friendly with Marine Corps general at White House. [572] Hemming heard plan to control movements of [not clear] go between local Latin American gov’ts. and U.S. Plan to have Mexican government photograph and fingerprint everyone going to and from Cuba. (Emphasis added) 3/20—Wallace Welch reports Hall and Hemming visit Dallas. Hemming called, saying he was returning from California where his father had died; needed a place to stay. Welch says he remained in Dallas 3/24 & 3/25 but didn’t know where he stayed. This indicates that Hemming knew in early 1963 that the Mexican government was going to photograph everyone going to and from Cuba. Recall in Chapter 19 that the Mexican federal police may have performed the operation for the CIA of photographing people entering and leaving the Cuban and Soviet consulates. It seems very significant that Hemming was in such high-level intelligence conversations that he was aware of this information which did not become available to researchers until well into the 1990s! It is interesting that in early 1963 Hemming was variously in Los Angeles with Loran Hall; in Dallas with Hall visiting General Walker on two occasions (January and March); and with top military brass in the White House and with other government officials. What makes this incongruous is the following entry, dated April 1963: Interpen down to about 6 members—difficult to get money—[Hemming] worked part time as gardener. 4/17—Information received that Hemming [is] part-time gardener—lives in Miami— till training at No Name Key—rarely visits camp—Hemming less interested in military expedition— ore interested in politics. (Emphasis added) What we see here is that despite the reports that Hemming was broke and hocking his rifle, he was doing all of this travel, managed to get to Dallas and Washington, D.C., talk to high officials, and then ended up back in Miami working as a gardener. Hemming now appears to be down on his luck. His Interpen group appears to be inactive. This is only one month after meeting with top brass in Washington, D.C., and Dallas. But two months later, things seem to have changed: 6/6—Information that Hemming visited Prio re: possible training camp with Hemming in charge. Now, about ten weeks later, as the JFK assassination in Dallas nears, we have the following notation dated July 3, 1963: 7/3—Hemming leaves Miami for Dallas to visit General Walker. Walker reportedly told him he wasn’t interested in participating in Cuban affairs. Hemming also conferred with Lester Logue of Logue & Patterson—geologists, oil man, rich."},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":" Logue has 6-8 man group interested in fighting communism but can’t participate with Hemming at that time—afraid of offending government officials. Said [not clear] his men are in U.S. Army Reserve. Will be going to Washington for briefing—will return, then can assist Logue in some way. (Emphasis added) An FBI contact report confirms in part the foregoing two paragraphs from Patricia Orr’s notes, but with a twist. The informant to the FBI was named as Dick Whatley, one of Hemming’s cohorts. The document reads: ...On 07-11-63 MM[-] advised that HEMMING left Miami on 7/3/63 arrived in Dallas on 7-4- 63 where he conferred with Gen. Edwin A. WALKER [who] would not back any specific cause as he wanted to remain free to fight Communism all over the United States. Following this meeting, HEMMING then met with Lester LOGUE, Geologist and Oil Man at the firm’s office, 628 [not clear] Building, Dallas, Texas. LOGUE told him that he had a (6-8) six to eight man group which is interested in fighting against Communism but that he, LOGUE, could not participate as he could [not afford] to offend U.S. Government officials. Logue further states that [he was] working with a Colonel and a Major in the U.S. Army Reserve, both of whom were due for future promotion, and that shortly they would be attending a Government Intelligence briefing in Washington, D.C. and that when they returned and briefed LOGUE [he would] then be in a position to help HEMMING in some way. LOGUE said that he would visit Miami, Florida in about 10 days and set-up an intelligence unit, send [the] men to handle the funds and also personnally [sic] see some people about donating boats to HEMMING’s Anti-Castro movement in Miami. In my second and third interviews with Hemming, he elaborated on what took place at the July 4, 1963 meeting at General Walker’s house and the subsequent meeting on July 5 at the Petroleum Club in Dallas, which is where he says he was offered a contract to assassinate President Kennedy. This will be reported in some detail later in this chapter. Another report, out of sequence but important: November 1961—Report that Hargraves associating with Rolando Masferrer Rojas; also active with Hemming. As noted in previous chapters, Masferrer has appeared in numerous accounts as a prime suspect in the Cuban connection to the JFK assassination and as a link to, if not a part of, the Mafia. These (and other documents) link Masferrer to the Hemming group through Hargraves, completing the circle back to the meetings in Dallas of Vidal and Hargraves with General Walker and Colonel William Bishop in which assassination of JFK was discussed. We now have a series of notations as the Patricia Orr summary nears the end. November 11[1963]— Vidal reportedly just returned from Dallas where he visited Walker; now interested in moving to Guatemala or Nicaragua. There about 5 days. Bad financial situation. From Nov. 1963 to March ’64—Hargraves and Vidal closely associated. Helped Vidal obtain arms, ammunition, a boat. Hargraves stopped by U.S. customs agents; Vidal infiltrated Cuba— captured and executed. November [1963]—Hemming furnished the Miami office with information in November 1963 which resulted in location and apprehension of a bureau UFAP subject. December 17 [1963]—Vidal says he is loosely associated with Roy Emory Hargraves. Says U.S. stands in way of his operations. Said U.S. supported Manuel Ray Rivero & Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, who also get preferential treatment by government.... right-wing groups not helped.... In spring or summer ... meetings for Cuban Committee for Liberation—Carlos Prio took over"},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"association. Vidal refuses to be represented by Prio; does not back Artime. (Emphasis added) January 1964—1/5 Dickey Chapell, Edward Collins, Roy Hargraves on boat that sunk off Miami. Vidal came to rescue. Would be mission planned by Hemming although he wouldn’t participate. April 1964— Vidal and Hargraves close from Nov. ’63 to April ’64. In April Vidal infiltrated Cuba —was captured and executed. (Emphasis added) We see in the above notations more confirmation of General Escalante’s statement of Vidal’s trip to Dallas in early November 1963. Then Vidal being in bad financial condition and his interest in moving to Guatemala or Nicaragua (perhaps anticipating leaving the U.S. after the assassination?) We also see Vidal and Hargraves being closely associated between November 1963 and March 1964. (This will have even more importance as the story develops.) Recall that, according to Colonel William Bishop, Roy Hargraves and Vidal visited right-wing businessmen and retired military officers in Dallas in 1963, during which the assassination of JFK was discussed. We also see Hemming seeming to be an FBI informant. And General Walker seems to be an FBI informant, as well as Hemming’s contact in Dallas, Wallace Welch. Note that Vidal has now concluded that the U.S. government is “standing in the way” of his operations to free Cuba. Vidal says that the U.S. is supporting Artime, Menoyo, and Prio, and not helping “right-wing groups.” This fits with the generally accepted theory that it was the right-wing (radical anti-Castro) faction of the Cuban exiles that became disillusioned with the Kennedys when they started cracking down on their operations and taking control of the anti-Castro movement, shutting down various radical Cuban activities that the Kennedys could not control. And we see Felipe Vidal Santiago, the heroic Cuban freedom fighter, rescuing his comrades and going on dangerous raids into Cuba, then being captured by Castro’s forces and executed in April 1964, as was also reported by General Fabian Escalante at the 1995 Nassau Conference. Of considerable interest are nine pages of FBI documents dated February 21, 1967, and first released from the National Archives in 1993, all concerning Roy Hargraves under the subject heading “JFK, Suspect” [573] The documents contain Hargraves’ biographical information and prison record earlier noted, plus more detail: From November, 1963, through March, 1964, HARGRAVES was closely associated with, and worked for, FELIPE VIDAL SANTIAGO, a Cuban revolutionist in Miami. HARGRAVES helped VIDAL to obtain arms, ammunition, and a boat. He transported the boat and military equipment between Miami and the Florida Keys. When HARGRAVES was stopped by United States Customs Agents, VIDAL clandestinely left the United States and infiltrated Cuba. VIDAL was captured and executed by a firing squad in Cuba in April, 1964. (Emphasis added) Note that Hargraves was closely associated with Vidal and worked for him. Another FBI document really caught my attention: On January 10, 1967, William Blanton Acker, 302 W. Magnolia, Auburn, Alabama, student, Auburn University, advised he had just finished reading article regarding assassination of President Kennedy in January 14 issue of Saturday Evening Post and wished to furnish the following information. In 1963 he was in Miami, Florida, employed at the Royal Castle, Number Two, Flagler and Second, and met one Art Silva. Silva at that time was living with one Phyllis (Last Name Unknown) at a small hotel across the street from Royal Castle Number Two. They later moved to an apartment in a court near LaJune Road and Eighth Street which was behind a fruit stand. One of their neighbors"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"in the court (consisting of about ten units) was one Roy (Last Name Unknown) who was living with some woman, name unrecalled, in the court next door to Art. Roy, according to Art, had several telescopic sight rifles, grenades, mortars, dynamite, etc., in his room. Also Roy had made a trip to Dallas, Texas, in late 1963 and was reported by Art to have Secret Service credentials. Roy was also associated with various Cuban resistance movements and was an ex-Marine. Acker notes that instant article he read says a policeman stopped a man in Dallas who showed Secret Service credentials. Acker says at a Christmas party in 1963 he was arguing with Roy and almost came to blows as Roy blamed former President Kennedy personally for the death of one of his close friends who was in the invasion at the Bay of Pigs. Acker says that late in 1963 he met Art [Silva] in an open air sandwich shop in Miami to have a beer and Art talked of his next door neighbor Roy and said Roy was working with the Cubans and would help Acker get in with the Movement if he wanted to help out in winning Cuba back from Castro. Art also said, “Somebody is going to die. Somebody who hasn’t hurt anybody. He doesn’t know it but he is going to die.” Acker says he asked Art, “Who?” and Art said he couldn’t say. Art also said “Roy is in something big, the biggest thing this country has very [sic] seen.” Acker says that he thought Art was talking about a robbery or something of that nature as he suspected Art as being mixed up with various underworld characters. At this time, Acker believes it was the assassination of President Kennedy after reading the article in the Post of January 14. (Emphasis added) I asked Hemming about this document in a telephone conversation on April 11, 1993. He confirmed that the “Roy” was Roy Hargraves but said, in effect, without further comment, that the document did not tell the whole truth. How did the FBI deal with this extremely important evidence? In their usual way. They found someone to give Hargraves an alibi and declared that Acker had a “diseased mind.” They then sealed the file so that it would not see the light of day. In an FBI report dated February 6, 1967: [574] ...In view of the fact that this investigation is predicated upon information furnished by WILLIAM BLANTON ACKER, JR., an individual with a diseased mind and also because a reliable source advised that ROY EMORY HARGRAVES was in Miami from November, 1963, to March, 1964, engaged in Cuban activities, no further action is being taken at Miami, UACB. The portrayal of Acker as having a “diseased mind” was in another FBI report dated January 11, 1967. [575] The document described Acker, age 45, as a veteran of World War II who had served in North Africa, Italy, France, Germany, and Austria, and had been admitted to a veterans’ hospital in Tennessee for a mental condition. (Why not, after those campaigns?) He was then discharged and advised by his doctor to go to Miami and get a new start in life, as he had separated from his wife. The same document described Acker’s source, Art Silva, as “probably a transvestite.” Here we have the suppression of evidence possibly at the heart of the crime. The evidence is trashed in superficial, flimsy reports with no questioning of Roy Hargraves. Obviously, Hoover wanted this evidence killed, using one of the tools in his bag of tricks: Have some government psychiatrist declare the person to be mentally ill. (In describing Acker as having a diseased mind and Silva as a transvestite, the description seems to be of Hoover himself. How ironic!) Another FBI document, dated July 18, 1967, is an FBI report about Jim Garrison’s trial in which Roy Hargraves is reported as having met David Ferrie. This was in an interview at Garrison’s office of Michael W. LaBorde, son of Larry LaBorde. After identifying a photo of Roy Hargraves, Michael LaBorde said that he had been told by a Pete (last name unknown), a hotdog vendor who worked in the French Quarter in New Orleans, that “Roy had called David Ferrie a week, two weeks, or a couple of days before the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963,” but Pete didn’t know what the conversation"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"was about. (One must ignore this, I imagine.) Following is a recap of the evidence concerning Roy Hargraves in this chapter and the previous chapter: 1. Colonel William Bishop said that he, Vidal, and Hargraves met with General Edwin Walker and two others in or about April 1963, and in this meeting assassination of JFK was discussed. Hemming says that he himself was at meetings with Walker, Willoughby, and others, but not in the same meetings. He said that he introduced Vidal to Walker. 2. Before his execution in Cuba on about April 1964, Vidal told General Escalante that he went to Dallas in early November 1963 and met with wealthy Texas businessmen at the Petroleum Club. This is confirmed by an HSCA document showing Vidal in Dallas November 6 to 11. Independently of this, Colonel Bishop told Gary Shaw of a similar trip by Vidal to Dallas, but in April 1963. Hemming independently told Dick Russell of a trip to Dallas by Vidal, but in the week before the assassination. And we see above that Hargraves was with Vidal on an April trip in which assassination was discussed. 3. According to FBI documents (which the FBI disparaged), Hargraves could also have been with Vidal on the trip the week before the assassination. Witness William Blanton Acker, Jr., said that Hargraves was living in one of a group of cottages in Miami, Florida, in 1963. Acker quoted Art Silva, saying that Hargraves had telescopic-sight rifles in his cottage. In a discussion with Acker about Hargraves, Silva said that something big was going to happen in Dallas—somebody was going to die: “Roy is in something big, the biggest thing the country has ever seen.... Hargraves made a trip to Dallas in late 1963. He had Secret Service credentials.” In an argument with Acker at a Christmas party in 1963, Hargraves blamed President Kennedy personally for the death of one of his personal friends who was killed at the Bay of Pigs. Acker and Hargraves almost came to blows. 4. Hargraves and Vidal were closely associated with Rolando Masferrer, who has been closely linked to the JFK assassination and, according to Colonel William Bishop, received $500,000 from Jimmy Hoffa for a contract to assassinate President Kennedy. Masferrer at one time was training assassination squads in the Florida Keys. 5. Vidal was linked to the staged shooting at General Walker by virtue of the 1957 black-and- white Chevrolet at Walker’s house at the time of the shooting. Reinforcing this is that Colonel William Bishop said that he had driven Vidal to Dallas in that same make and model of car in April 1963. Hemming told me that Vidal borrowed this car on occasion from one of his relatives. He also told me that he suspected that “Hargraves was involved in this incident.” 6. Hargraves was part of Hemming’s Interpen group and involved with Hemming in numerous operations. He was considered to be Hemming’s number-one action man. Considering all of the foregoing about Hargraves, it seems to entangle him and Felipe Vidal Santiago in the Kennedy assassination in a big way. Their exact roles remain unclear. Another FBI document of great interest, dated April 18, 1975, and released by the National Archives on June 14, 1995, provides evidence that links Lawrence Howard to Oswald. As noted several times, Lawrence Howard was in Hemming’s Interpen group. [576] This document was about statements by a witness, Richard Monroe Margeson: To: Director, FBI From: Buffalo Assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, November 22, 1963, Dallas, Texas"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":" On April 18, 1975 Sheriff Allen L. Capwell (NA) Wyoming County, N.Y., personally appeared at the Buffalo office of the FBI and related the following info which he had obtained from Richard Monroe Margeson, DOB June 16, 1927, Rochester, N.Y., residing Webster Road, Wyoming County, N.Y., on April 14, 1975 whom Capwell has personally known for past five years. Capwell has no reason to believe Margeson is not stable. Margeson while living in Los Angeles, California in 1962 met one Lawrence Howard, Jr., 6 ft., 300 lbs., of Mexican decent [sic]. Howard was engaged in collecting funds to support the anti- Castro forces. Howard went to Florida Key in 1962 for six months for purpose of training troops to invade Cuba and thereafter in late 1962 returned to Los Angeles accompanied by Rudy Hernandez, Mexican, in his 20s, 5’2\", heavy build and un-sub [unknown subject] AKA “Slim,” no other name known, white male, 5’6\", also in his 20s. Slim and Rudy resided at Olive Hotel, Olive Street, Los Angeles. Howard’s specific address unknown but lived in East or Northeast Los Angeles. All were employed by a Jack Casey, not further described, painting and refurbishing the old Union Temple bldg. located behind the Los Angeles Greyhound Bus station. This building reportedly housed the Marquade (ph) Printing Shop in the basement, which at that time was engaged in printing the original draft of Richard M. Nixon’s book after he lost the presidential election. Through these individuals, Margeson met a man called “Tex” who arrived from New Orleans in late 1962 or early 1963. Tex reportedly was a hit man and described as white male, late 20s, 5’6\" to 5’9\", slender build, 135 pounds, with former military service and a rotten disposition. Margeson said Tex visited Margeson’s house on Trigg St. in East Los Angeles and furnished his name as Harvey Lee. Tex left Los Angeles destination unknown, after about two weeks. Following President Kennedy’s assassination and pictures of Lee Harvey Oswald appeared in news media, Margeson realized that Tex and Oswald were identical. Margeson said Howard was later subpoenaed by former District Attorney Garrison, New Orleans, Louisiana during course of Garrison’s investigation of this matter. Margeson decided to come forth after viewing a recent TV documentary on the Warren Commission investigations wherein it was depicted Oswald was in Russia while in fact Oswald was in California. This caused Margeson to believe that a conspiracy could possibly have existed in that Oswald may not have acted alone. Buffalo indices contain nothing identifiable with Margeson and Howard. Bureau is requested to assess the above info and furnish Buffalo with pertinent info to assist Buffalo with interview of Margeson in event Bureau so desires. (Emphasis added) An attachment to the above document corrected a misunderstanding that Margeson had concerning dates: Margeson thought that Oswald was still in Russia in late 1962 or early 1963 when the incident occurred with him in Los Angeles. But Oswald had returned from Russia in June 1962; therefore, it could have been Oswald, using the name Harvey Lee, in Los Angeles. Another document, originating from Army Intelligence dated June 19, 1970, 111th MI Group (III), about 60% of which is blacked out, provides evidence to link Lawrence Howard, William Seymour, and possibly Loran Hall and/or Hemming, all members of Interpen, to meeting Oswald in Dallas on their way to Florida in 1963: Source mentioned as an aside that during the build-up of 1963, a number of volunteer civilians was making their way across the US into Florida. It was during this time that three individuals from California became know within his separate “clic.” Source supplied the names as follows:"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"[Deleted] probably located in California, possibly El Monte [Lawrence Howard?] [Deleted] presently located in Tucson, Arizona [William Seymour?] [Two lines deleted] According to [deleted], both [deleted] met with Lee Harvey Oswald in Texas while enroute to Florida prior to the John Kennedy assassination.

AGENT’S NOTES: Source was completely cooperative during the interview and provided names, addresses, and telephone numbers from a small address book in his possession.

Sirhan; Burton was in the employ of Jim Garrison, not Hemming; the North Hollywood telephone listing was for Dick Hathcock’s detective agency where Payne worked. Hemming then denied to me that he met Oswald in Dallas with Hall. A CIA document released from the National Archives on March 3, 1995, brings William Harvey into the LaBorde story. This document was apparently triggered by an article in the Denver Post quoting LaBorde making derogatory remarks about the CIA. The document was signed by Harvey and dated June 29, 1962. 1.

This document could either be genuine, or false to show LaBorde being purged when in fact he was being distanced from the CIA in preparation for a future operation involving him. *** When Hemming and I settled down for our discussions on Friday afternoon in my home in San Diego, it was apparent that he was a troubled man who wanted to get many things off his chest. One personal moment occurred on Sunday afternoon in my upstairs office. At my request, Hemming had brought photographs of himself for inclusion in my book. As I sat at my desk looking at the photographs, I was struck by what a handsome, all-American specimen he was when he was in the Marine Corps and afterward when he was running a parachutist school in Florida. (See photos at beginning of chapter.) I thought of the parallels of Hemming, Oswald, and Nagell. All three had been patriotic young Americans who joined the armed services to serve their country. All three were dedicated and courageous, seeking adventure. All three were inducted into intelligence—they became spies—and later became sucked into the JFK assassination quagmire and used. They were trained to violate the law; to become criminals; to murder, lie, and cheat as part of their patriotic duty. Then, when the intelligence agencies were through with them, they were written off—tossed on the human scrap heap and, in Oswald’s case, murdered. I expressed these sentiments to Hemming as I looked at his photos. Then, without warning, tears started welling in my eyes as I said, “What a tragedy—what a waste! And for what?” Hemming, sitting across from me, observed this without expression. But the next morning at breakfast (we had stayed up until 1:30 a.m. the night before in a wild discussion of the JFK assassination and Hemming’s role), Hemming came down from the upstairs bedroom, sat down across from me, and immediately said, “I want to apologize for being so rough on you. I promise you I will never do that again, ever.” Then Hemming lowered his face onto his arms on the breakfast table and started to sob, “Kennedy was our last chance. He was all we had; our last hope.” His anguish went on for I don’t know how long —a minute or a half minute perhaps. My wife was in the kitchen and I waved her to leave the scene, which she quickly did. Hemming then said, “I’ve decided that I’m going to have you tell my story. You’ll have some sympathy for me. And I’ll tell my son that he can change his name if he wants.” This all came as a shock to me, totally unanticipated. But what was Hemming telling me? He continued in metaphor, “You know, when one gets on the train in a conspiracy and then gets off the train, one still is guilty of treason in the eyes of the law.” He was obviously referring to himself. I listened without asking questions. Hemming had told me earlier that he was going up to Pomona to meet his brothers and their families. (Two of his brothers practice law in Pomona.) He said they would be saying to him, “My god, Gerry, what are you going to do to the family now that will embarrass us?” I found myself replying, “Gerry, you listen to your brothers—you do what they say. Don’t tell me anything that you or they will later regret.” He left that morning, headed to Pomona, driving my Jeep. He returned Thursday evening and I drove him to the San Diego airport. I didn’t ask any more questions of importance; we spoke only in generalities. As I left him at the airport, I told him, “This has certainly been a memorable weekend.” He looked at me understandingly, without saying anything. That night, and in the days following, I was severely shaken by my long encounter with Hemming. I had the surreal feeling that I had been with either one of President Kennedy’s assassins or one of the prime players that were caught up in the plot. But doubts tore at me. The degree of his involvement would remain to be seen. Probably the most important information that Hemming gave to me over that weekend was on Sunday afternoon. I asked him again to go over the details of the contracts that he had been offered in New Orleans and Dallas to assassinate President Kennedy. As he talked, I made notes which I later converted to a list that I mailed to him for his review and comments. It turned out that we went over this list in our"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"first interview in Fort Lauderdale, in which Hemming made some changes in detail. (Please keep in mind that the FBI and CIA documents confirm—for items 1, 2, and 3 below— that Hemming was in Dallas and New Orleans and in contact with these people on the dates or periods stated. The only exception is de Mohrenschildt, who is not mentioned in the documents. Here is the result of the final edit: 1. In March—April 1962 Gerald Patrick Hemming was approached by Guy Banister to assassinate John Kennedy. Hemming said that he turned him down, saying, “Are you fucking crazy!” This meeting took place at Luis Rabel’s home in Metairie, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans. Present at the home but not privy to the offer by Banister to Hemming were Frank Bartes, Luis Rabel’s son-in-law, and Larry LaBorde. Also present was Howard K. Davis, whom Hemming thinks may have overheard the proposal. Hemming said it appeared to him that Larry LaBorde was working for Guy Banister at the time. This offer took place after Banister took Hemming aside by the fireplace out of earshot. 2. On July 4, 1963 Hemming and Howard K. Davis met with General Walker at his home in Dallas. They first met in a park, after which Hemming and Davis, without Walker, went to Wally Welch’s office to arrange lodging for the night. Hemming and Davis then went to Walker’s home and talked with him until about 5:00 a.m. There was no JFK talk at this meeting. Discussion was about who the Cubans were, who to deal with, etc. It was at this meeting that Walker left the window curtains open, which Hemming had mentioned in our first interview. 3. The next day, July 5, 1963, Hemming and Howard K. Davis had lunch at the Texas Club in Dallas with George de Mohrenschildt, Lester Logue, and others. Hemming and Davis then went with Logue to the Petroleum Club that afternoon and met with a group in a large conference room. There were several clusters of people and two large, long tables in this room; and at one end of the room Hemming and Davis were approached by one man; four others were within hearing distance. The man made a proposal to Hemming to assassinate JFK. Nelson Bunker Hunt was in the room but at the other end from the man who made the proposal. Hemming declined this proposal, saying, “You shouldn’t be talking to me directly about this.” Hemming would not identify the man who made the offer. 4. On November 18, 1963, Vidal left for Dallas from Miami; he was driven there. He returned by plane on the evening of November 22, getting into Miami at nighttime. (Hemming told Gaeton Fonzi and me at the meeting in Fort Lauderdale that the man who took Vidal to Dallas on November 18, 1963 was Vidal’s case officer. This implies that Colonel William Bishop might have been Vidal’s case officer.) 5. Vidal did not have a driver’s license, thus explaining why he did not drive. (He could drive, however, according to Hemming.) This fits with General Escalante’s statement that Vidal told the Cubans he was driven by Colonel Bishop from Miami to Dallas in early November, 1963, where he met with wealthy Texans. All of the above items are consistent with the statements of Colonel William Bishop and the documents that Hemming gave to me. Recall that Colonel Bishop spoke of meetings in Dallas with Vidal, General Walker, and others, in which assassination of JFK was discussed. Other meetings included General Charles Willoughby, then the employee of H. L. Hunt. The importance of this chain of evidence cannot be overemphasized. For the first time we have direct evidence that strongly tends to implicate the Dallas right wing in the JFK assassination. It also implicates Guy Banister in New Orleans. It is tied together by independent statements of General Fabian Escalante, Colonel William Bishop, FBI and CIA documents, and the statements of Hemming. Recall once more that Hemming had told Dick Russell in 1992 about Vidal going to Dallas in the week before the assassination"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"and meeting with wealthy Texans. Hemming made this statement before Escalante’s statement in Nassau, and not knowing of Colonel Bishop’s statements to Gary Shaw. All of this must certainly be considered a major breakthrough in the JFK assassination mystery. When we get to the first interview in Fort Lauderdale, we will go into more detail on the above five items to illustrate Hemming’s intricacy and specificity in making sure that I got this evidence correctly as he had stated it. A question that remains is whether Hemming did, in fact, accept the contract offers to kill Kennedy, after initially turning them down—as he had described tradecraft practice. Hemming denies that he accepted either of the contracts. But we must consider that either, or both, or part of these contracts could have later been consummated with Hemming indirectly through cutouts. Another important disclosure in this interview concerned David Sanchez Morales. Hemming told Fonzi and me that he had met Morales once in a coffee shop in Little Havana. He said that in this encounter Morales was with the infamous “Carlos,” first written about in Fonzi’s book The Last Investigation. (Carlos is a pseudonym for a person whom Fonzi was investigating as having known Oswald, having high-level CIA protection, and as a key figure in the JFK assassination, whereupon the HSCA was prematurely shut down and Fonzi was instructed to stay away from Carlos.) [577] When Hemming encountered Morales, he didn’t know who he was and got into an argument with him. Hemming called Morales a “Cuban snitch” and a “beaner.” When Morales became angry, saying “You must have a pretty big piece to be talking that way,” Hemming threatened to kill him, saying, “I have a gun here that will blow a hole clear through you.” Present at this scene was Manolo Reboso, member of CIA’s Operation 40, [578] later to become vice mayor of Miami. Hemming said that Reboso intervened and told him that he was way out of line. According to Hemming, this incident was his only contact with Morales (later Hemming told me he ran into Morales before this incident, and even could have been involved indirectly in Morales’ operations). Recall that Hemming was seemingly unaware of Morales’s relationship with Bill Harvey and Johnny Rosselli. “Carlos” having been with Hemming, David Morales, and Reboso at this incident gains more importance when we consider other, later linkages between Hemming and Carlos. Hemming was in partnership with Carlos in a weapons export group named Parabellum Corporation in Miami. This is revealed in a letter on Parabellum letterhead that Hemming gave to me, dated April 26, 1972, to the Office of Munitions Control, Department of State, Washington D.C., requesting a permit to export certain arms. The letter, with an attached application form, shows the resignation of Carlos from the corporation, along with the resignation of Rolando Pedro Masferrer, nephew of Rolando Masferrer (Rojas), the man who allegedly received $500,000 from Jimmy Hoffa as payment to assassinate President Kennedy. Hemming was noted in the application as being vice president and operations director of Parabellum Corporation. I questioned Hemming about this in a telephone conversation in May 1997, and he confirmed that he was in fact in partnership with Carlos and Rolando “Rolandito” Pedro Masferrer at that time in 1972. But he said that Carlos had gone to Powder Springs, Georgia, to handle that end of the business in Mitchell WerBell’s manufacturing facility—the “farm.” Recall that WerBell’s specialty was assassination weapons, including his area of expertise, gun silencers. Hemming told me several times, “If you want to get to the bottom of the JFK assassination, look at WerBell.” Gordon Winslow, researcher in Miami, told me that Lucien Conein (Black Luigi) was also with Carlos at WerBell’s operation in Georgia. Conein was with the OSS in 1941 in France and fought with the Corsican Brotherhood. Later in his career he was a high official in the Drug Enforcement Administration. (Hemming claims that he himself was an FBI/DEA task force agent in the late 1970s.) It"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"was Conein who personally gave the green light to go ahead with the coup against President Ngo Dinh Diem on November 2, 1963, in which Diem and his brother were murdered. [579] CIA documents show that Carlos was at one time a high official in Brigade 2506, the embittered anti- Castro Cubans who survived the Bay of Pigs debacle. Carlos, along with Hemming and Roy Hargraves, managed to insert himself into Jim Garrison’s investigation of the JFK assassination. Carlos has the reputation of being a cold-blooded assassin who would kill you if you went after him. Hemming warned me of this, and he also warned A. J. Weberman. My belief is that caution is the better part of valor, so why should I spread Carlos’ real name around? Dozens of researchers know who he is. The associations of Carlos extended to “intimate links” [580] with Nazar Haro, the chief of the Mexican government’s police (intelligence) force, who, as earlier noted, was deeply corrupted in drug trafficking and other criminal activities with Sam Giancana and his electronic specialist and triggerman, Richard Cain. I asked Hemming about Carlos’ association with Haro, and he confirmed that it was true. Hemming’s often reported association with Rolando Masferrer Rojas has added significance when we consider that General Escalante named Masferrer as being involved with David Sanchez Morales in 1959-60 to provoke an uprising in Cuba (after Castro took over). Completing the circle, Richard Case Nagell told Dick Russell that two of his assignments by the Soviets when he was a double agent was to kill Masferrer and Oswald, because the Soviets suspected that the two were plotting to assassinate President Kennedy. The Soviets wanted it stopped, presumably fearing that the plot was to precipitate a war with Cuba, which would entangle them. (Nagell said that he couldn’t bring himself to kill anybody.) As we examine Hemming’s seemingly endless linkages with virtually every suspect in the JFK assassination, it is not surprising that he told me he seldom went to sleep at night with confidence that he would wake up in the morning. First Interview in Fort Lauderdale, Florida Seeing that I needed help to deal with Gerald Patrick Hemming, I called Fonzi and proposed that I retain him as a consultant for the meeting with Hemming in Fort Lauderdale. After some hesitation, Fonzi agreed, and I called Hemming to set up the meeting. The three of us met in a suite at the Marriott Hotel North. The discussions with Hemming lasted two days, October 30-31, 1996. I stayed on a third day to go over the material with Fonzi. My major objectives in this meeting were first, to review with Hemming the accuracy of the list of five major points just described. (As noted, the list is the final product of our discussions in Fort Lauderdale.) And second, to question Hemming regarding the Marita Lorenz story of the car caravan from Miami to Dallas in November, 1963 (described in Chapter 26). What follows is a condensed, edited version of the conversations, with the profanity deleted as much as possible without changing meaning: [581] Fonzi: Did you ever talk to Marita about all that which came out, about the cars going to Dallas? Hemming: Only through Weberman. Weberman put a lot of that in there. He has a fondness of helping people with total recall. What would she remember? I think one time in [Marcos Perez Jimenez’] living room when we were on Pine Tree Drive, I asked for extra sugar"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"for coffee. So [sarcastically] we must have been doing a lot of plotting and scheming with her [Marita]. We don’t allow females in the room when we’re doing business. They get jealous; they sell you out. They save your life by snitching out your colleagues. They get back at you with a vengeance. When are you going to find a female in there for very long? Twyman: Do you want to here deny you were in that caravan going to Dallas? Hemming: I tried to stop the caravan from going to Dallas. Twyman: She’s still writing in her book about a guy named Gerry with her in the caravan. So you weren’t in the caravan, that’s final? Hemming: It would be kind of hard if I’m sitting with Bill Baggs in his office—you know, Miami time. Twyman: At the time that the caravan took place? Hemming: Yes. Being at the airport on November 18th I thought that Felipe was going in the caravan when he left for Dallas Monday night. Hargraves told me he was flying out there. Twyman: Monday night was what date? Hemming: The 18th. Twyman: The 18th. Felipe left for Dallas? Hemming: I figured this Sturgis is going right behind Loran Hall. He’s going to see Lester Logue, Bob Morris, and the whole crew, that he’s not even supposed to know about. I mean, without even hearing from these people, this guy’s showing up on their doorstep. I said [to Felipe], I’ll give you two guesses. You’re not even in any of my address books! So how do you think he found out about you? ‘Cause he’s working for the FBI or something. Did I introduce you to him? What’s our agreement? If anybody even set up a meeting with me and comes back solo, everything is off. I’m telling them, stick their money up their ass. Fonzi: Sturgis went to Dallas? Hemming: Yeah, and I figured it was to burn my contacts, which is what Hall had been doing all year. Twyman: You didn’t know it was to kill Kennedy? Hemming: No, I didn’t know what it was for and to this day I don’t know what it is. I never asked him! I didn’t...I give a rat’s ass. This guy couldn’t shoot himself in the foot! This guy was a total waste of time. Had none of the tradecraft skills, knew none of the language, couldn’t remember when he took a shit last. He called me over whenever he interviews, used me as his memory bank for interviews time and again. Twyman: Was Orlando Bosch in that caravan, or do you know? Hemming: I doubt it. Twyman: What about the Novo [Novis] brothers? Hemming: They were teenagers then. They might not have even been born then. That’s what gives it up. Twyman: Pedro Diaz Lanz? Hemming: Yeah, he went."},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":" Twyman: So it would be him and Sturgis.... Hemming: Sturgis, Pedro Diaz Lanz, his brother Marcos Diaz Lanz (which I never told Weberman or anybody else). So you’re the first to hear that Marcos Diaz Lanz went along with them. Twyman: And you think Marita was in the caravan with them? Hemming: No. Guess who was paying for the caravan? —Perez Jimenez. Twyman: Could this caravan to Dallas have been some kind of a diversion story? Hemming: I believed at the time they were going to mess with my contacts. I have heard nothing, seen anything, or even asked Sturgis or anybody what it was about. Because I could give a shit, it’s meaningless to me. To think that Sturgis, other than as a patsy— somebody that you’d throw away, some Oswald-type asshole... that somebody would actually use this guy Sturgis for something is unbelievable. Twyman: Okay. Let’s go to my letter of October 11. I listed five items. What I want to do now is read them off and get your approval to put them—these five items—in my book. And you correct me if I am incorrect. [Reading] In March-April 1962 Gerald P. Hemming and Larry LaBorde were approached by Guy Banister to assassinate John Kennedy. Hemming says that he turned him down, saying “Are you crazy?” This meeting took place at Luis Rabel’s house with Rabel’s son-in-law, Frank Bartes... Hemming: No, totally wrong. Twyman: So what’s wrong then? Hemming: The whole thing. LaBorde worked for Banister. Okay? So it’s not Banister making an offer to me and LaBorde. LaBorde has engineered the meeting. I got nothing to do with Frank Bartes, who used to run the railroads in Cuba. Twyman: Okay, go ahead. Hemming: Banister doesn’t approach LaBorde or Davis. Banister takes me aside by the fireplace, out of the hearing of Bartes, Rabel, his gringo son-in-law, Howard Davis, and LaBorde. You know, ’cause he’s watching. And they’re busy talking bullshit and whatever. It’s usually the case. People break up. And me and Davis had one thing. We never stood together when we were dealing with people. He takes one element, I take the other. Then we compare stories later on. Fonzi: You say Davis was there? Hemming: Yes. Twyman: But it was you, alone, that Guy Banister approached? Hemming: Davis overheard it, yeah. Twyman: Davis overheard it? Hemming: Yes. Now I can sit and it would take me awhile and work myself back into almost the language that he used. I didn’t like the looks of some of this. I’d seen him with Bill Harvey in Miami at Agustin Capo’s house, one of Aureliano Sanchez Arrango’s bad-ass commanders. Capo, the guy that hid out Orlando Bosch in Costa Rica at his gold mine. This is a Cuban terrorist, but he’s an engineer. Okay? This is where the plot originated to kill Kissinger in San Jose, Costa Rica. Okay? Well, I’d stayed at that gold mine in ’79 when I was doing some operations down there. That’s where you hear all these interesting things. Now Capo was the guy who dealt with Bill Harvey and a number of"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"people and dealt with Banister in Miami. Because some weapons and equipment were needed off of some ships in storage. And they looked like thugs, but they wore suits, you know. I figured initially that these guys are mob people, it’s got to be mob people. It took a while to find out who they are. The thing was “we’ll go pull these weapons off of these landing ships and store it, and we got armored cars, et cetera.” They go to where the stuff is mothballed, cut their way in, put it in an armored car, and off they go. Nobody will stop an armored car. They were thugs, mobsters. [582] Twyman: So Frank Bartes wasn’t even there at that time, in that house? Hemming: He was standing six feet away from me across the living room. Twyman: Oh, he was there. Hemming: Luis Rabel, his American son-in-law, [and] Frank Bartes, Larry LaBorde, Howard Davis, and Banister. Twyman: Okay, with Rabel’s son-in-law and Frank Bartes. Hemming: Yes. Talking to Davis. Twyman: And LaBorde was there too, right? Hemming: Yes. Twyman: And also Davis was there? Hemming: Well, LaBorde started to move with Banister over to talk to me, and Banister waved him off. And that told me right away, who’s running who, that it was a setup deal. I wanted to discuss an offer with him basically, is what the guy is saying, let’s step over here. Twyman: It was clearly to kill Kennedy? The offer. Hemming: There were no cliches, no religious bullshit. Twyman: It was direct? Hemming: Yes. Kennedy’s got to pay for it. It’s time for him to pay for it. Twyman: That was March-April 1962? Hemming: Yes. Twyman: I think we have that one clear. Now, Item two: [Reading] On July 4, 1963, Hemming and Howard K. Davis met General Walker with Lester Logue in Dallas. Hemming: No. That was Walker by himself. Logue wouldn’t go near Walker. Twyman: So you and Davis met General Walker in Dallas. Hemming: At a park where Walker was giving a speech. Twyman: You first met in a park, then went to Walker’s house, and talked with him until 5:00 a.m. Hemming: No, Walker went home. We went to Wally Welch’s office to arrange for a place to stay that night. I told you that yesterday. Wally Welch’s office. A travel agency, or employment agency. What was it? Something...Space-Age Careers. W. Welch, Sturgis’s buddy. Twyman: ...to arrange lodging, then you went to Walker’s house. That’s both you and Davis went to Walker’s house. And talked with him until about 5:00 a.m. Hemming: You see, Welch had been there one time and had bad-mouthed faggots. So he wasn’t"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"welcome there. He’d been drinking; this was weeks before. Twyman: Was this when you were there and some of Walker’s gay friends... ? Hemming: They were coming down the stairway. And Welch ran his mouth off. Twyman: That was before this meeting. Hemming: Yes. Probably February 1963, during the return trip from Los Angeles with Loran Hall. Twyman: That was right after the shooting attempt on Walker? Hemming: No! The shooting is April 1963! Twyman: Well, you told me that after the shooting, you were in Walker’s house and he left the curtains drawn.... Hemming: Yes, we’re just getting there. Twyman: It was at this meeting that that occurred? Hemming: Yes. July the 4th. Until 5:00 in the morning of July the 5th. The meeting started the evening of July 4th, approximately 6:00 pm. Past midnight, windows open, talking all kinds of shit with Walker. We’ve got our back to the window and the drapes are open. So we figured it was a setup deal, the shooting. There’s the [bullet] hole. I could point at the hole. Fonzi: It was still there? Hemming: Yes. Twyman: There was no JFK talk...? Hemming: I’m sitting right in the line of fire! For hours. Afraid to go take a piss or he would try to follow me. Twyman: I have here that there was no JFK talk at this meeting. Hemming: Yes! That’s correct. Twyman: The discussion was about Cubans—who the Cubans were, who to deal with, etc. Hemming: Because there had been a list, that came out in the press [ The Miami Herald and The Washington Post in February 1963], of who the new Cuban leadership was, who were being recognized by the White House, in February. Well, Walker had since been to Miami, had dealt with a number of people. Not behind my back, but without any coordination from us. You see, we had figured we wouldn’t have Walker in direct contact with any Cubans at all since this racial shit at Old Miss in September the year before...a few months before. Cubans were extremely sensitive to this racial slur shit. Twyman: Okay. Go on to item 3. The next day, July 5, 1963, Hemming and Howard Davis had lunch at the Texas Club in Dallas with Lester Logue. Is that correct? And George de Mohrenschildt stopped by the table to chat. [583] Hemming: And others. Twyman: What’s that? And others. Okay. Hemming: Okay, let me give you the table arrangement. It’s a table half this size. The maitre ’d always is this Cuban, that they want to hear me talk Spanish and raise his morale because he gets these $100 tips and shit and rarely is a Cuban allowed in this establishment. So this guy, he really gets his jollies every time I come by and we talk Cuban shit. He’s a Veciana fan. It’s just Logue, Davis, me—okay? At other tables, other"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"people. I won’t have these fucks sit at my table and dirty my god-damned shoes. I don’t give a fuck if they’re generals, or colonels, or dick-suckers. I won’t have them at my god-damned table. Fonzi: So it’s just you, Davis, and Logue at this separate table. Hemming: Yes. I don’t give a shit how much money we’re getting from these people. Hey, you know when you can sit at my table? After you’ve gone out the door with me on a Cuban drop zone, when we jump into Cuba. Then you can sit at my table. Twyman: Okay. Then you went to the Petroleum Club that afternoon. Did you go with Logue and de Mohrenschildt and Davis? Hemming: Logue was the only one there at the Petroleum Club that we knew or had ever seen before. Twyman: You went with Logue, and Davis was there, to the Petroleum Club that afternoon, and met with a group in a large conference room. Hemming: Same thing we had done at the Texas Club. Once you’re up from the table you go to the conference room, talk to people. Twyman: There were several clusters of people in this room... Hemming: Two large, long tables. Twyman: Two large, long tables. Hemming: We sat at the end of the long table, entrance door to the right, over at the other side. We deliberately walked to the opposite side of the room before we even shook hands. Want to shake hands? Come on over, sucker. They’re hard to deal with, them right-wing Americans, John Birchers, and all. Good war. Get a dime out of their ass. I got more from the god-damned Socialists and Jews. Twyman: [Reading] And on one end of the room Hemming and Davis were approached by five men with a proposal to assassinate JFK. Is that correct? Hemming: There were three standing, within hearing, that appeared to be participating in the statements. Twyman: And one man made the statement? Hemming: Yes. This is after some serious conversation. I mean he just didn’t blurt it out. We’re discussing operational aspects, [584] and budgeting, what things would cost, and it took a long time to do it. And towards the end of the conversation, finalizing budgetary considerations and equipment purchases and proprietary corporations and all the shit that’s our business, the cocksucker blurts that shit out. He looked around before he did it. And the people were in agreement with him. He says “Why are we using this money that’s on the table?” And I told them, don’t open no money and attache cases with money around me. I’ll deck your ass. But he was pointing “Why should we be using this money when it would be better yet to take out Fidel’s boss?” Twyman: Were you sitting at the end of the table or standing up? Hemming: We were standing up, discussing shit. Paperwork was on the table. Twyman: Now was this a statement of “why use this money when we can take out ...?” Hemming: Why use this money for these operational aspects when we can go to the heart of the problem and take out Fidel’s boss with the money."},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":" Twyman: Fidel’s boss being...? Hemming: [Loudly] ‘Cause we’d already told them we’re not going to take Fidel out for the money! Twyman: Did they say Kennedy, or did they say Fidel’s boss? Hemming: We’re having a brief. They said, Fidel’s boss. And everybody chuckled. We’ve already covered these things having to do with Fidel Castro and his brother and the whole thing. Are you opening that subject again? No, we’re talking about “who’s Fidel’s boss.” Tell, pray tell. Twyman: So there was this... Hemming: “Jerk FK in the White House.” Twyman: They didn’t actually use the word, though? Hemming: “Jerk FK in the White House.” Twyman: They called him “Jerk FK”? Hemming: Yes. Oh, a little bit harsher followed that: “Traitorous son-of-a bitch that sold you people out at the Bay of Pigs.” Twyman: So it was a direct reference to Kennedy without any ambiguity at all? Hemming: The god-damned asshole. To have money on the table and all that operational shit laying there and to raise that subject! Good thing we weren’t armed! Because he would have tasted the wrong end of a 45. I’d have taken all his teeth out. [585] Twyman: Okay. Now, Nelson Bunker Hunt was in the room but at the other end? Hemming: [Seeming to avoid my question] What was my response? Twyman: What was your response? Hemming: What does it say there? Twyman: [Reading] “You shouldn’t be talking to me about this.” Hemming: Yes...“ directly about this.” Indicating that, “Hey, don’t dirty me up so somebody comes after me because I know too much. Don’t be discussing plans that down the road something happens.” Because I’ll come for you first, you know. You didn’t hang a target on me. You hung a target on yourself. Better hope JFK lives a long life, because if he has an accident you’re going first because you tried to hang a target on my ass. Twyman: So you interpreted this, if I am hearing you correctly, either as a serious offer to do this or as the.... Hemming: Dead serious. Dead serious. These are shifters from the Fidel shit from two hours before. All this domino, house of cards falling apart if you take out Fidel. I said it will get worse if the Soviets take over, asshole. We started this conversation in ’62 before the missile crisis, with these kind of people. And here we were back again a year later talking ourselves blue. They had supported me with heavy bucks.... Twyman: To take out Fidel? Hemming: No, to support Tony Cuesta and Felipe and the rest of the operational people. That’s how Alpha 66 was founded! I mean tons of god-damned money. Like, “Hey, did you hand me the money?” Am I a Cuban citizen? I don’t owe you a thing. I made that clear to those people. Did I ever take a dime? You know. I don’t even owe you an explanation. You assisted some Freedom Fighters. You know? And now a year later you’re coming"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"back with this same horseshit you brought up a year ago. This Fidel crap. Now this same JFK crap. I don’t want to hear that shit! Twyman: So you were extremely emphatic in turning them down? Hemming: Yes. Twyman: No ifs, ands, or buts? Hemming: Well, let’s say that I was breathing on the top of his head real quick when I stood up. Twyman: Now, I have here that Bunker Hunt was in the room but at the other end of the room. Hemming: Yes. Twyman: Had you met Bunker Hunt previously? Hemming: Yes, through Bob Morris. Twyman: We talked about that yesterday, about when you were in his office previously. Okay, now I’ve got item 4. [Reading] In the week before November 22, 1963, Felipe Vidal Santiago met with wealthy Texans in Dallas. Hemming: He left the evening of the 18th of November. Four days before the assassination. Twyman: Left for Dallas? Hemming: Yes. Twyman: Felipe left for Dallas, evening of November 18. Fonzi: Was he at the [Miami] airport? Hemming: No. [wryly] He didn’t like the smell of that airport thing. Twyman: You mentioned that you think he flew to Dallas? Hemming: I presumed that he did. I didn’t find out until years later that he hadn’t. Twyman: ...that he’d been driven there? Hemming: Right. Twyman: How did you find that out? Hemming: Shit, I don’t keep track of the sources anymore. Twyman: Okay, but you found out that he had been driven there. Hemming: Yes. Twyman: Okay. Let’s get to this last item. Fonzi: Did Vidal, as far as you know, go to Dallas with Sturgis? Hemming: Never asked him. Fonzi: So you don’t know? Hemming: Never asked him. Can you imagine the scenario? [Hemming is now talking about another operation after the JFK assassination.] You know, the most important thing in your life is here. You’re going on an operation right now, that’s what you’re together for, it’s not a coffee klatch. And you’re together, getting the boat fueled up, and then you say, “Hey, let’s talk about what you did last week or last month.” What are you, a nut or something? We could be dead in a few hours. We didn’t sit around and talk shop. Twyman: You never asked Vidal what happened in Dallas? "},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"Hemming: No. It’s not done. I was pissed, okay. And I pressed only to this point: I let him know, “Don’t ever talk to my money people behind my back, even if they invite you out there, or we will cut your ass off.” That was the primary reason. I didn’t want them cocksuckers making offers to him that they’d made to us! F onzi: Who are you talking about? You told this to Sturgis or Vidal? Hemming: Vidal. I didn’t view it with Sturgis. If I needed a dog’s butt I’d call Sturgis. The guy’s a snitch. You know, why do I need Sturgis? We’d done rode off his ass back in ’61 and told him to stay the fuck away. He keeps popping up like a turd that won’t flush. Twyman: When you heard that JFK was killed on November 22, you must have thought... Hemming: I was waiting for the trucks to pull up out in front and nail my ass. Twyman: You must have thought... “Oh, shit....” Hemming: Not about Sturgis. Twyman: I meant about Vidal. You knew he’d left for Dallas. Hemming: No, no. He was already back. Twyman: He was back from Dallas? Hemming: He was already back at about 5:30 pm, sunset in Miami. I mean when I went over to make phone calls and shit, no, uppermost in my mind? Fucking Loran Hall! Psychotic son-of-a-bitch.... Twyman: When did Vidal, to your knowledge, leave Dallas to come back to Miami? Hemming: That afternoon. Fonzi: He was back in Miami that Friday afternoon? Hemming: Yes, flew back. Twyman: I’m trying to say, could he have been in Dallas at the time of the shooting? Vidal? Hemming: Well, it was nighttime when he came back to Miami. Now, what do I think occurred? “The money-grubbing mother-fucker had him standing there when the thing went down.” Okay? You probably can’t even imagine the scenario. Okay? You’re in an office, rich Texans, and there’s about 10 people in the room. Okay? [in falsetto voice:] “...you know what just happened!” Five minutes later, you’re talking to the boss of the team. Where’s the money? Maybe he don’t even know what he’s saying. That’s how it works. Twyman: So he could have been just set up? Hemming: [Loudly] Yes! Yes. Usually killed!—who said it was going to happen. It just happened. This is the guy who runs the team. Payoff. Twyman: In your ear. Hemming: Yes. That’s how it goes down. Twyman: You lure somebody that you want to set up, into the scene? Hemming: What if the moneybags find out that he’s a patsy? Did you have something to do with the assassination? Fuck no. You’re a klutz. Okay? The professional doesn’t work that way, in a room with other people. Blackmailers do, extortionists do. So these assholes pay up. And years later they might find out they paid the wrong people. Twyman: Now you’re not inferring that Vidal...."},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":" Hemming: No. I’m saying that’s how it goes. And, if it had worked, Vidal wouldn’t tell you. My son’s named after him. If I heard that from Vidal I wouldn’t tell you anyway! But that’s how those assholes work. That’s why I spent a considerable amount of time proving who didn’t do it, and who had been extorted, so they could take severe action against their blackmailers. I was hoping I was wrong a couple of times...[laughs] that they’d actually done it....[the blackmailers, not Felipe] Twyman: Are you talking about money that had been contributed to the general cause? Hemming: ...by people who knew where the money was going and what it was for.... Twyman: And so all these guys... Hemming: ...have some people around to do it. Twyman: So let’s take Pawley as an example. He put up some money... Hemming: And I told him not to! Twyman: And he thought it was to be used to kill Kennedy. Hemming: Yeah [shouting] no, no, he... Twyman: You see we’ve got to get it straight! Don’t get mad at me! I’m trying to get it straight. Hemming: It is too bad these guys didn’t use the money for what they got the money for. They went and killed Kennedy with it. Twyman: Okay. That’s what I thought you said. Hemming: Pawley doesn’t ever work that way. Prio the same thing. He paid through the nose. Fonzi: Who do you think killed Pawley? Hemming: Same cop [hit man] that killed Prio. And they knew it was coming. They knew it was time. They knew in advance, you know. Twyman: Why was Pawley killed? Hemming: Because they were told. It was time. Twyman: Yes, but why was it time? Hemming: Well, whoever decided it was time. Twyman: Usually there’s some reason.... Hemming: [Sarcastically].... write more books. When you’re in the business, when somebody tells you it’s time, it’s time. Accept it. What do you think—there’s an appellate court or something? [586] Twyman: Gerry, would you recommend that I just take out this stuff about the cop, same cop killed Pawley killed Prio? Hemming: It’s known in the community. Twyman: So you don’t mind me keeping it in there? Hemming: No. But Pawley is not a plotter against Kennedy’s life. Twyman: That’s an important thing to say, because a lot of people think he was. [587] Hemming: This is a guy who deals with the DCI, okay? A former ambassador. And the ultimate occurred. The thing you fear the most. Your people went out and did some shit. The people you financed went out and did some shit they weren’t supposed to do."},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":" Twyman: [Reading] Item 5, “Vidal did not know how to drive a car.” Hemming: He probably knew how, but he didn’t want to take the driver’s test. He just didn’t drive. Twyman: Okay, General Fabian Escalante said that Vidal told the Cubans when he was captured that Colonel William Bishop had picked him up in Miami and driven him to Dallas in November 1963 where he met with wealthy Texans. Now that apparently happened in the early part of the month. [Hemming says this was Morris (Maurice) Bishop, but, as noted earlier, Colonel William Bishop said that he himself also used that pseudonym.] Hemming: When I went to D.C., that happened when I went to D.C., in February-March 1963. Felipe had gone to Dallas to get support to save Elbow Cay P.O.W.s. Now when he went there on November 18th, maybe it was the same guy [Colonel Bishop]. I don’t know. I was worried. I told him, “Stay away from Sturgis.” He said, “No, it’s not Sturgis. It’s my case officer.” I said “Okay, but stay away from Sturgis. He’s going to Dallas to burn our financial contacts. You might get arrested there. It might be a setup deal.” Twyman: You said he was going to Dallas to see his case officer? Hemming: [Shouting] No, no, no! It wasn’t Sturgis taking him to Dallas. It was his case officer taking him to Dallas! Twyman: Okay. That’s what I wanted to get at. His case officer was going to pick him up and take him to Dallas. Hemming: No, he [Vidal] just said “Take me to Dallas.” I knew about the caravan. I said, “Don’t go if Sturgis is driving out there, okay? Roy has told you. Don’t go near Sturgis or you’re through dealing. No money, no nothing. If you think you can go to our people directly in Texas, for money, with Sturgis, you are off the god-damned dole!” Twyman: But to me it’s interesting, at least, that Vidal referred to the man who was going to take him to Dallas as his case officer. Hemming: We had seen him meeting with his case officer at his house and just turned around and walked out back to the car. We don’t mix with those assholes. Twyman: Could Colonel William Bishop have been his case officer? Hemming: Not likely. I didn’t give a shit. I wasn’t even interested in even knowing the guy! Some chair-born son-of-a-bitch that belongs down in Cuba fighting, sitting in Miami, dealing with snitches that were betraying their own country! Like narco snitches. So the intelligence business is. You’re dealing with snitches who are going to betray their own religion and their own country. What is your religion—democracy? What kind of shit work is that? Get paid for it, get to make a career out of that horror shit. Might as well work for the DEA. At this point in the interview I was reasonably satisfied that my first and second major objectives in going to Fort Lauderdale had been accomplished. Hemming took a law book out of his briefcase and had me turn to the section that included the federal statutes regarding treason. He said that I should buy a copy of the book inasmuch as the title of my book is Bloody Treason. The federal statute that he pointed out defined treason in a variety of forms, one of which is participation in a discussion of a plot to assassinate any officer of the United States government. I surmised from this that Hemming felt that he might be guilty of treason by simply being present in discussions about killing Kennedy."},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"When Hemming was in San Diego he had mentioned this statute to me after he had made his intriguing statement about “getting off the train,” indicating that he felt that he was guilty of treason for becoming involved in the Kennedy assassination and then bailing out somewhere along the way before its culmination. I hesitated to bring up the subject in front of Fonzi because I felt that it might inhibit Hemming from telling me more. So during a break, when Hemming and I were alone on the patio balcony, I asked him what he meant by “getting off the train.” I said, “Did you mean simply that by merely sitting in on the offers to kill Kennedy, and having turned them down, and failing to report or try to stop it, that you are guilty of treason in the eyes of the law?” He said, “Yes.” I had the distinct feeling that Hemming had decided after leaving San Diego to tell me no more. I had come all the way to Fort Lauderdale and was getting nothing new. It was later in the day when Hemming revealed that Felipe Vidal had gone to Dallas on November 18 and returned on the night of the 22nd. This was very important. It put Vidal in Dallas at the time of the assassination. It showed a chain of evidence, not just of the Texas right wing making an offer to have President Kennedy assassinated, but also a follow-through to have Vidal in Dallas with his CIA handler, Colonel Bishop, at the time of the murder. Moreover, Colonel Bishop had attended meetings with the Texas right wing and Vidal in the weeks preceding the assassination. Also, Vidal had expressed bitterness toward the U.S. and was making plans to leave the U.S. for Guatemala at the time of the assassination. I thought that perhaps Hemming was at least giving to me that important information, realizing that he had promised me something for the expense and trouble of the trip. But I still felt that he had decided to close the door on revelations of any deeper activity on his part in the Kennedy assassination. After all, I had advised him not to tell me anything that went against his brother’s advice. What did I expect? I was satisfied concerning the intense dialogue about the two different offers of contracts to Hemming to assassinate John Kennedy made by Guy Banister in New Orleans and wealthy Texans in Dallas. In particular, I felt that Hemming came off as being extremely truthful in his detailed and pointed correction of the items in the five-point statement that I had sent him to review. He was very specific, very certain, and very detailed in his criticism of what I had written from my notes in San Diego. If he had made it up as he went along, he was a world-class actor and had missed his calling. For myself, I believed him about the contract offers, and his and Vidal’s trips to Dallas. The credibility of his statements in context was, of course, reinforced by the previous statements of Colonel William Bishop and General Fabian Escalante. A. J. Weberman’s Allegations In the Fort Lauderdale interview, I decided to put the “$64,000 question” to Hemming—to ask him, point blank, if he had anything to do with killing Kennedy. Here is the way I put it: Twyman: Can I state in my book that when these offers to assassinate Kennedy were made to you—you never accepted them, you never followed up on them and you had nothing to do with killing Kennedy? Hemming: Exactly. Twyman: Okay. Hemming: I sure as hell wouldn’t be living in this country now if I had. A few minutes later I asked Hemming this: "},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"Twyman: Did you have anything to do at all with handling Oswald in Mexico City? [Hesitation, without response from Hemming. I pleaded...] The answer is “No,” right? Hemming then answered by saying that the last time he saw Oswald was a brief encounter at a motel in Miami on December 6, 1962. Not much of an answer, I thought. After meeting with Hemming again in Dallas and then returning to California, I contacted Weberman in mid-December by telephone, the first time that I had ever talked with him. I caught him at work and he was in a hurry. He quickly summarized, in eight flat statements, his conclusions about Hemming. What follows is my discussion of Weberman’s conclusions, combined with subsequent telephone conversations with Hemming in which I asked him about them. These telephone conversations took place on December 23, 1996, January 10, 1997, and January 18, 1997. In an attempt to make a coherent story out of all this, I will use the vehicle of Weberman’s eight allegations and interweave this with Hemming’s responses, plus information from past interviews with Hemming, Weberman’s database, government documents, and add my own comments. Here is Weberman’s list (in bold italics), followed by Hemming’s responses, along with my comments: 1. Hemming knew Oswald in the Marine Corps; introduced Oswald to Angleton: Hemming responded “Not likely.” Here I would agree with Weberman. Note that in my first interview with Hemming he intimated that he had introduced Oswald to Angleton, although not saying so directly. This is, of course, enormously important, if true. In Weberman’s database he concludes that Angleton sent Oswald to Russia, after Hemming had introduced him to Oswald, with only Angleton’s closest confidants in CIA’s counter- intelligence knowing about it; i.e., the CIA hierarchy was totally ignorant of Oswald’s trip to Russia. This explains much about the mystery, including the lack of documentation in the CIA’s files about Oswald. (In a later marginal notation, Hemming wrote “[You are] Correct about Jim [Angleton] sending Oswald to U.S.S.R.” As to introducing Oswald to Angleton, he wrote “An unknown snitch punk?!” Also, if Hemming is correct that Oswald was “dangled” to a Soviet-Japanese spy ring, then Angleton probably already knew of Oswald, and may have sent Oswald to the Cuban Consulate to contact Hemming to get help in infiltrating Oswald into Cuba, thus explaining Hemming’s efforts to give Oswald the assistance that he says he did.) 2. Hemming set up Oswald at Dealey Plaza—induced him to bring the gun into the Depository by paying him double for it: Hemming chuckled. Then he said, “What I told him, I said, how about citing to some authority instead of citing to CIA documents and then putting your own story in there and not even going according to the text of the document. He has no answers. It’s pure fantasy.” I agree with Hemming here. Weberman doesn’t seem to have any evidence of this, other than intuitive inferences. 3. Hemming set up the fake shooting at General Walker’s, actually fired the shot himself. Hemming said, “Well, what’s his cite to authority?” He then added, “There is one possibility—I told him there’s a possibility that Hargraves knew something about that. But Weberman doesn’t want to hear. I can spend hours going over material and data and say, this is it—this is the basic information. He just wants to go off on tangents and speculate to this, speculate to that, and it’s just meaningless to me. It’s like science fiction to me. Now where do the ideas come from? Because it doesn’t come from logic. Nothing of what he says can be traced back to any form of logic, any legal theory, anything that a prosecutor or historian would do. And that’s why it’s very problematic. He just goes off on tangents.” Nowhere in Weberman’s vast database had I found anything to directly support this allegation. (Hemming later told me that Weberman actually meant Hargraves instead of Hemming, because he was afraid of retaliation from Hargraves if he used his name.) 4. Hemming flew Oswald around Texas in the Odio incident: Again, Hemming said, “Not likely.”"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"I then responded, “Now, you mentioned new documents coming out that might say that.” (Earlier in this conversation Hemming had told me about “new documents.”) Hemming responded, “No, one or two have already been released...but these are speculations...and what interests me most is the documentation that I know exists that they leave out, that would give some credence, actually would give more credence to the theory, but they leave the good stuff out. Because it points in other directions, too.” As before, nowhere in Weberman’s database did I find documents to substantiate this allegation. Also, in a later telephone conversation with Weberman, he admitted that he didn’t have concrete evidence to support his allegation that Hemming flew Oswald around Louisiana and Texas, but Weberman indicated that the circumstantial evidence supported his statements. 5. Weberman doesn’t know if Hemming was at Dealey Plaza or in Dallas on November 22—but he mentioned the big man with the gun being seen in Dallas: This question never did get adequately answered by Hemming because of an apparent confusion in understanding between him and Weberman. They had discussed this subject the very same day of my phone call. This has to do with a Secret Service document that I had received from Anna Marie in December, 1996, and had sent to Hemming. Weberman had the wording in his database, but he did not have the actual document. The document is quite interesting: JOHN STEVENS RUTTER LAWRENCE, born May 21, 1940 at Oak Park, Illinois, advised he resides at 709 Devonshire Street, Richardson, Texas, and is employed at the Lone Star Gas Company, Research and Development Department. He advised that at about 11:45 AM, November 22, 1963, he was walking north on Akard Street from Commerce to Main with a friend, PHILIP BEN HATHAWAY, a fellow employee, and two other fellow employees, JOHN H. WITHERS and ALAN D. LEWIS. His attention was called, by HATHAWAY, to a man walking in the opposite direction on the same side of the street, whom HATHAWAY said was carrying a rifle. He looked at the man pointed out by HATHAWAY and saw that the man was about 6 ’ 5\" tall, and weight about 250 pounds or more. He appeared to be a professional football player type and very muscular. He had dirty blond hair [588] and wore it in a short crewcut. This man was in his 30’s and was wearing a light colored business suit and white business shirt. LAWRENCE said he believes he could identify this man if he saw him again. on: 11/22/63 of: Dallas, Texas File # DL 89-43 [?] By Special Agent: WALLACE R. HEITMAN/rmb Date dictated: 11/23/63 At the bottom of the document, someone had hand-written: HEMMINGS? At this point in Hemming’s and my telephone conversation, Weberman had only heard about this document and had been talking with Hemming about it. Apparently, Hemming had thought that John Stevens Rutter Lawrence was the Jack Lawrence that had worked at the Lincoln-Mercury agency, and that the men walking with Lawrence were employees of that agency. Obviously, Hemming was mistaken. (Hemming later noted when he reviewed a draft of this chapter, “We’ll see about that!”). Nonetheless, the document could be very important. It gives a dead-ringer description of Hemming in 1963 except that he is apparently clean-shaven and has cut his hair. When I asked Hemming about this description, he said that this man was his “doppelgänger,” German for double or look-alike. (Recall that Hemming has consistently claimed that he was “set up” in the JFK assassination.) I wondered if it could have been Hemming, and that he had gotten back to Miami from Dallas in time to create a semblance of an alibi. I asked Hemming to once again tell me about his alibi. (In our meeting in San Diego he had said that"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"he had heard about the assassination on the radio in Miami and had gotten a ride with someone close to the Kennedys and gone over to the Miami News and talked to the editor Bill Baggs about it. He now added that newsman Hal Hendrix [589] was present when he met with Baggs, along with [names withheld by author], all three whom Hemming said were CIA assets.) I now asked Hemming what time he met with Baggs. After hesitating, he responded that he had met with him about 2:00 to 2:30 p.m. Miami time. The lone man with the rifle was seen at 11:45 a.m. Dallas time, which was 12:45 p.m. Miami time. This would be one and one-half hours, after the sighting of the man in Dallas, for Hemming to have gone to an airport in Dallas and been flown by supersonic jet from Dallas to Miami and gotten to the Miami News . I discussed the possibility of this with a friend who is an ex-marine fighter pilot and a seasoned pilot for a major airline. He has flown many types of jets. He got out his flight planning charts and a compass and scaled off the distance from Miami to Dallas. He said that with even a Korean War-vintage jet fighter it would have been easily feasible to make the flight from Dallas to Miami in less than one hour, flying at high altitude where the speed is greatly increased compared to sea level. Counting time to travel to and from airports it would have been barely feasible for Hemming to have returned to Miami to make the meeting with Bill Baggs. This assumes that he had a jet fighter available to him for the trip. But then, Hemming was only roughly estimating the time he says he was at Bagg’s office. Maybe it was 3:30 p.m. instead of 2:30 p.m. Or even later. Who knows? (Hemming later noted that he estimated the flight could have been made in 1.8 hours in a TF100 Supersabre at 35,000 to 40,000 feet altitude at mach .9 and with pylon tanks.) We must realize that there is no documentation known to be available that substantiates Hemming’s alibi. Hemming did tell me that Baggs wrote a memorandum about Hemming’s presence at the Miami News on November 22, and sent it to (of all people) Bobby Kennedy. (Bill Baggs was Bobby Kennedy’s pipeline to and from the Miami Cuban exile community. Recall the CIA document describing the meeting in Miami on behalf of the White House in which Hemming, Hargraves, and Baggs were present, among others. It does indeed seem that Hemming had some sort of relationship, even if indirectly, with the White House and the Kennedys.) Hemming added that after meeting with Baggs, he had gone over to Little Joe Garman’s house to talk with him and others about things. [Little Joe (Joseph Cavendish Garman) was one of Hemming’s Interpen group.] I asked Hemming if he saw Felipe Vidal that evening and Hemming, hesitating, strangely responded, “I don’t think so.” This seemed very curious inasmuch as Vidal had just returned from a trip to Dallas that Hemming had warned him against. And President Kennedy had just been assassinated. One would think that Hemming would be able to clearly answer whether or not his close friend Vidal was there at Little Joe’s on that historic evening of November 22, 1963. (Hemming provided an answer to this later in Fort Lauderdale, presently to be discussed.) Another thing to keep in mind is that at the meeting in Fort Lauderdale, Hemming at length went into how easy it was to fake an alibi. Fonzi and I questioned him on this, and he said, in effect, “Who’s going to check it? Particularly if you’re in a remote place.” He also started to say, “Who’s going to check it if you have the F...” and then he stopped his sentence. 6. Hemming was brought into U.S. intelligence through his uncle, Art Simpson (his uncle in California), who knew all of the big guys [I didn’t get their names clear from Weberman]: Hemming responded, “Well, that was one of the factors. I went out on my own and ran into situations, and was introduced to Frank Wisner, and then later, through my uncle, to Angleton. But that had nothing to do with ’U.S. intelligence’ per se.” Hemming had gone over this with me several times in previous interviews. It seems beyond question that he was brought into the Marine Corps with the intention that, after looking him over for a period of"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"years, he would be moved into U.S. intelligence work. Hemming described the amazing degree of freedom he had while in the Marine Corps. He described “accidentally inviting himself” to go on U.S. training flights from the airbase in Olathe, Kansas. At the Fort Lauderdale meeting I suggested to Hemming that he had been brought into U.S. intelligence without him even knowing it had happened. He said, “That’s the way it works.” 7. Hemming practiced shooting with Oswald in Dallas, collected shells to plant in the School Book Depository building: Hemming said, “That’s Weberman’s story of this big, bearded guy at the Sports Drome shooting range, and all that kind of crap. I’ve got a beard now, all of a sudden.” Weberman cites the Warren Commission describing a big man with a reddish beard shooting with Oswald at the rifle range. (Hemming did not have a “reddish beard,” but he could have dyed his hair or beard. Hemming had once remarked to me about hair dying if needed on operations.) 8. Hemming tried to get Oswald into Cuba, but the Cubans wouldn’t take him: I said to Hemming, “You’ve told me that whole story, where Oswald was trying to get into Cuba, and that all you did was give him some papers and let him go with that.” Hemming responded, “That would keep him out of trouble and get him in to make his spiel, but not to guarantee his employment.” There is little conflict here between Weberman, myself, and Hemming. One thing has puzzled me, however, about Hemming’s encounter with Oswald in Monterey Park, California: What would have motivated Hemming to travel forty-five miles to the Marine Base in Santa Ana and finagle his way in to talk with Oswald, unless he had instructions from someone to do this? [590] Hemming did tell me that he provided Oswald with the know-how and paperwork to get into Cuba, but he has never said that anyone instructed him to do it. [591] Was he instructed to do this by CIA’s Angleton, whom Hemming had called concerning Oswald’s appearances at the Cuban Consulate and Oswald’s wanting to defect to Cuba? Was this the way that Angleton learned about Oswald and decided to send him on a mole hunt to Russia? Supporting the idea that Angleton sent Oswald to the Soviet Union is John Newman’s recent book, Oswald and the CIA, in which Newman shows a pattern of CIA documents that lead to an Angleton counter-intelligence operation in Russia using Oswald. [592] Analysis of Hemming’s Guilt or Innocence To approach the analysis of the evidence concerning Hemming’s degree of involvement in the JFK assassination plot, I decided to develop scenarios varying from the most extreme involvement of Hemming that I could imagine, to the least involvement; then develop scenarios between these extremes. After that, I would eliminate the extremes if they were beyond common sense, then work from both ends of the spectrum of scenarios to narrow down to the fewest that were reasonably plausible based on the evidence. The most extensive involvement I could imagine was this: Hemming saw a business opportunity in 1961 or 1962—a need among powerful, wealthy people to have JFK assassinated—and he personally planned and promoted the assassination, sold the idea to his financial sponsors, raised the necessary capital, and personally managed the Dealey Plaza operation, with his Interpen group doing the setting-up of Oswald and the actual shooting of Kennedy. The least extreme scenario, Hemming’s lowest degree of involvement that I could imagine, was that Hemming had nothing at all to do with the assassination and that everything he had told me was a fabrication and a con job to make himself famous and get a book publishing contract after I had published"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"my book. The reasoning that I used to rule out the worst extreme was that, for Hemming to have conceived of the assassination, masterminded it, promoted it, and carried it out, and kept it secret for thirty-four years was just too much for a wild, twenty-six-year-old renegade ex-Marine and his renegade, rag-tag group. Possibly Hemming was brilliant enough to do the planning, but I could not imagine any monied group being willing to take the risk of being involved with him and supplying the cover-up by U.S. government officials and the Dallas police, the logistical maneuverings of the parade route that were required, the recruiting of the French Corsicans, et cetera. I ruled out the extreme of Hemming’s least involvement in the plot because I believed Hemming in that he, at the least, did receive and turn down the contract offers in New Orleans and Dallas, and that he knew that Kennedy might be killed but said nothing about it. Hemming displayed too much remorse to me, and gave too much specific testimony, in repeated questioning by me and Fonzi over many days, for me to believe that he was making that all up. And I believed Hemming about Vidal’s trip to Dallas on November 18, 1963, returning on the evening of the assassination, because Hemming had told that story, essentially, to Dick Russell in 1992, and it had been corroborated by General Escalante, although with a date at an earlier part of the month (November 11), and also by Colonel William Bishop. Moreover, I believed Hemming’s corroboration of Colonel William Bishop’s story of Hargraves’ and Vidal’s visit to General Walker in the spring of 1963 in which the assassination was discussed. By looking at the totality of all of these documents and corroborated statements, and even the uncorroborated statements, we see a very persuasive body of evidence that points to Hemming’s Interpen group as being deeply involved in the Kennedy assassination. The question is, was Hemming himself involved in all of this, or, as he claims, had some of the key people in his group left him to become involved in the assassination on their own? To try to make some sense of this, I narrowed the information and evidence down to three plausible scenarios [593] to fill the gap between the two extremes: Scenario #1— Hemming told me the truth about all of the key issues: That is, he was offered a contract to kill Kennedy by a right-wing group in Dallas and another right-wing group in New Orleans, and turned them both down, but some of his men and associates, Vidal and Hargraves, went ahead anyway, leaving Hemming out of it. Vidal and Hargraves were in Dallas at the time of the assassination ( Note: being there does not in itself prove they were involved); Vidal and possibly Hargraves participated in the General Walker incident. All of this is reinforced by the documents that Hemming left with me. Scenario #2— Hemming told me part of the truth: That is, he did turn down the contract offers, but later accepted one of them, or both, through a cutout, received money in advance, started the ball rolling in maneuvering Oswald around New Orleans, Texas, and Mexico City, setting him up; but when the crunch came, Hemming’s better and wiser instincts took over and he bailed out, leaving the actual shooting of President Kennedy to others. In this scenario, Hemming also might have become suspicious that he himself was being set up as a fall guy, but Vidal and some of the Interpen group (perhaps Hargraves) went ahead anyway, ignoring Hemming’s advice. This is in line with Hemming’s many statements to me that he had become suspicious that he was being set up. Scenario #3— Hemming accepted one or both of the contracts, but his role was later modified by his sponsors so that he would be responsible for only one compartment: that is, handling Oswald and setting him up. In this scenario, Hemming carried his role to completion with his Interpen group, including Vidal and Hargraves, but only Vidal and Hargraves went to Dallas at the time of the assassination. In this scenario it seems plausible to me that the major plotters may have deliberately excluded Hemming from going to Dallas and participating because they felt he was too wild, reckless, or"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"unreliable. Based on the way Hemming described his behavior toward the New Orleans and Texas people who made the contract offers, and toward David Sanchez Morales, I can believe that they may have made the decision to keep Hemming in the plot in a limited role (if for nothing more than to implicate him so that he would keep his mouth shut), but to use his men for other roles, including the main event. This scenario does not preclude Hemming and his men having been considered as potential fall guys to be eliminated if ever things came apart. After all, Hemming and Howard K. Davis were ostensibly on Castro’s side—they both had volunteered to help Castro in the revolution and could have been painted as Communist agents, as Oswald was painted. Also, Vidal was a Cuban who easily could have been portrayed as a Castro spy, who had doubled to the United States and acted as Castro’s man to direct the shooting in Dealey Plaza. In all three scenarios, it was not necessary that Hemming be in Dallas on the day of the assassination, or even in the days preceding. (This was his modus operandi: plan, raise money, set up missions, dispatch his people and remotely control them, coming to the rescue if needed.) In all three scenarios, Hemming and his crew were primarily motivated by patriotism (however tragic and misguided) and a need for adventure, fame, and noble purpose. Like many others, they were caught up in the anti-Communist movement of the extreme right wing of that era, and felt that they were working for the best interests of the United States, sanctioned by their superiors. I thought back on our wild conversation in San Diego. On Saturday night, about midnight, we were expressing our views on who it was that killed President Kennedy and the way he was killed. I persisted with my feelings that the extreme right wing either was behind the assassination or a major part of it. Hemming suddenly yelled out, with pain, “The Patriots did it! The Patriots did it!” Hemming himself, of course, was an ultimate patriot in 1963. (Hemming later tried to explain to me what he meant by “Patriots”: The rich fat-cat patriots, “like the Rocky Flats people.”) Thus far my investigation of the anti-Castro Cubans and Hemming had borne results. I now had substantial evidence, if not courtroom proof, of complicity of the Dallas right wing and the CIA (Colonel William Bishop, Felipe Vidal, and possibly Roy Hargraves) in the plot to assassinate President Kennedy. Moreover, I had direct linkages among Vidal, Hargraves, and Masferrer. And direct linkages among Colonel William Bishop, Larry LaBorde, and Hemming to the CIA’s William Harvey and his ZR/RIFLE program; and linkages to John Martino, to Mafia leaders, and Jimmy Hoffa. A definitive structure of the plot at the operational and planning levels was taking form. In this, Rolando Masferrer and his associations with Hemming, Vidal, Hargraves, Jimmy Hoffa, and organized crime loomed importantly. And Hemming’s associates Loran Hall, Lawrence Howard, and William Seymour were an important part of the picture, at least insofar as their relationship with Oswald. As to Hemming’s specific involvement, a modified scenario somewhere between scenarios 2 and 3 seemed to be the most accurate description, with Hemming having a key role in framing Oswald that he had not yet revealed to me. I wanted to leave the Hemming story at this juncture. My publishing date had long since been missed. I felt that there was too much important information in the book to delay getting it out to the public. But I couldn’t let the Hemming story go. I decided to go to Fort Lauderdale one more time for another marathon session with Hemming and Fonzi. While on the East Coast I would go to New York City and meet A. J. Weberman for the first time to see if he had more to say about Hemming than was in his massive data base. A. J. Weberman had only two hours in which he could meet with me in New York City. We met in my hotel room in the Marriott Marquis on April 26, 1997. Weberman confirmed everything that he had told me on the telephone, and more. He said he has now changed his mind about Hemming not being in the Marita Lorenz/Frank Sturgis car caravan to Dallas; he now believes that Hemming was in the caravan,"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"and moreover, Hemming’s story of the November 18 incident at the Miami airport is a fabrication, a cover story to hide the fact that he was in the caravan. He also said that although most of what Hemming has told him over the years is true, Hemming embellishes his stories and is beginning to recant on some of them. But Weberman is still in touch with Hemming. He said that he had befriended him and helped him financially over the years. Only recently, Hemming sent him a copy of the document that I had sent to Hemming about a Hemming look-alike carrying a rifle in Dallas on the day of the assassination. One significant point came out in my discussions with Weberman when I was telling him about Colonel William Bishop and Felipe Vidal. I mentioned that Colonel Bishop had told Gary Shaw that the pseudonym “Maurice Bishop” was a composite of Colonel Bishop himself, E. Howard Hunt, and David Atlee Phillips—all three had used that pseudonym on occasion. Weberman remembered that, a few years ago, Hemming had told him the same story. This seemed to indicate that Colonel Bishop’s and Hemming’s stories on that point had merit; and it made sense in that often several CIA agents would use the same pseudonym when it applied to the same purpose (WI/ROGUE I, II, III, for example). Another item that came up with Weberman is that I mentioned to him that he had written in his book Coup D’Etat in America that Hemming had “admitted knowing Oswald and helping to set him up.” [594] Amusingly, Weberman had forgotten that he had written this! But when I showed it to him, he said, “Well, I wrote it, so he must have said it.” Weberman admitted that he had put his theory together about Hemming from circumstantial evidence and intuition. He said that everywhere you look in the JFK assassination evidence you find Hemming. And he mentioned the large number of members of Hemming’s Interpen group who were linked to the assassination. I agreed with Weberman on all of this, but still couldn’t bring myself to reach such absolutely positive conclusions as had Weberman. (Perhaps Weberman is an intuitive genius.) Second Interview in Fort Lauderdale In Fort Lauderdale, Fonzi, Hemming, and I met in the Ocean Hacienda Inn for two days, April 28 and 29, 1997. We had a frustrating, exhausting, but revealing discussion in the marathon sessions. One of the most important points was Hemming’s admission, earlier noted, that his Interpen member Ronald Ponce De Leon was the “young, good-looking Cuban kid” who John Martino had told his wife was involved in the Kennedy assassination. Accumulative with this was something Fonzi brought up about the 1995 conference with Cuban intelligence in Nassau. Fonzi reminded me that General Escalante had told our group that when the Cubans captured Tony Cuesta (earlier noted as an active radical anti-Castro Cuban closely associated with Vidal), Cuesta had told Escalante that a Cuban exile by the name of Herminio Diaz was involved in the JFK assassination. Fonzi said that Diaz was a Trafficante hit man. When Fonzi related this, Hemming immediately said “Herminio lived with me in Miami!” Tony Cuesta was eventually released by the Cubans and returned to Florida, incapacitated by a missing leg and virtually blind. [595] When I returned to California, Fonzi mailed to me an article printed by the Cuban National Preparatory Committee for XI World Festival of Youth and Students: ...Revolutionary forces surprised them and a battle ensued in which artillery pieces began to fire on the enemy transport that had brought them. Consequently, Antonio Cuesta Valle [Tony Cuesta], chief of the infiltration group and Eugenio Enrique Saldivar, both residents of Miami, were arrested and seriously wounded. Agents Armando Romero Martinez and Sandallo"},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":" Heminio Diaz Garcia were killed while attempting to invade our territory. They were involved in smuggling in weapons to assassinate Commander Fidel Castro. Herminio Diaz was a known gangster linked to Mafia types such as Santos Trafficante, with whom he had shared the same table at the Riviera Hotel in Havana in 1959. The CIA admitted to the Senate Committee that it had used Santos Trafficante and other underworld figures in the assassination attempts on Castro. However, the Agency has made numerous attempts to demonstrate that those plans in which the Mafia and Trafficante were involved, never went beyond the planning stage. False! Herminio Diaz, a Mafia type hired by Trafficante and recruited by him to work in the CIA, carried this plan to the stage of execution when he landed in Cuban territory with powerful arms to try to kill Fidel Castro. (Emphasis added) And so we have the growing list of Hemming’s associates, with substantial evidence indicating their involvement in the assassination or its periphery. The list includes Roy Hargraves, Felipe Vidal, Loran Hall, William Seymour, Lawrence Howard, Ronald Ponce De Leon, John Martino, Frank Sturgis, and Fonzi’s “Carlos.” In addition we have Larry LaBorde and the New Orleans Jack Lawrence, who Hemming claims were involved, and both were associated with him. And Hemming says he knew Oswald and was involved with him in assisting him in trying to infiltrate Cuba. Yet Hemming himself claimed innocence to me of everything except being given offers to kill Kennedy, which he turned down. When we met in Fort Lauderdale, I showed Hemming the passage in Weberman’s book in which Hemming had told him about helping set up Oswald. He studied it carefully, and handed the book back to me without comment. This follows a general pattern of Hemming’s not denying unequivocally any of the accusations that Weberman has made about him, leaving the degree of his involvement an open question. Before I left for Fort Lauderdale for the second interview, Hemming had made an astounding statement to me on the telephone. It was apparently triggered by his review of an earlier draft of my chapter about him, in which I had written that I could not imagine monied people giving a wild, young, rag-tag group like Interpen a contract to kill the president of the United States. Hemming said that I should realize that Interpen was modeled after U.S. Special Forces “A” teams. He said Interpen was assembled in part from former Green Berets. When in Fort Lauderdale, he handed me an annotated copy of my chapter with the following written in the margin: Basic training of Special Forces “operations” (Green Berets) requires extreme knowledge of all forms of “unconventional war-fare.”—I successfully completed those offered by the U.S. Marine Corps Institute, M.B., Quantico, VA... The first things Hemming showed Fonzi and me at Ford Lauderdale were photographs of handsome, clean-cut Green Berets. He displayed them proudly, as if to say, “This is the kind of people that were in Interpen.” I said, “Your telling me that Interpen was composed of Green Berets puts a whole new light on things. Are you saying that the image of Interpen members begging on the street, living in flop houses, and being in general a bunch of bums, was a cover story for the fact that you were from former U.S. Special Forces?” Hemming nodded in agreement, but did not go further, except to say that they were one of several quasi-“A” teams that had been created. Hemming was noncommittal when I suggested that the U.S. military or CIA supplied Interpen with finances. (This could have been accomplished through William Pawley. Researchers have assumed that Pawley was using his own money to finance the Cuban exile movements, but he could have been a conduit for CIA money.) This became even more fascinating when I returned home and studied Hemming’s notes further: "},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"Interpen created as Inter-American Penetration Force by Jim Angleton while I was still in Cuba! (Special Forces “A” Teams). (Emphasis in original) Angleton had created Interpen!? Hemming qualified his statement that Interpen was partially staffed with ex-Green Berets, saying that they brought in ex-GIs and less qualified people to perform duties such as building campfires or maintaining the bush camps. The more we learn about James Angleton, the more it seems that he was in some way central to the JFK assassination plot. Consider this: 1. Angleton was very close to J. Edgar Hoover, according to CIA’s John Scelso. He had a direct line to him. Also, Hoover had a direct line to H. L. Hunt, as you may recall. 2. Angleton was with William Harvey in counter-intelligence at the beginning of the CIA. They had been reported as rivals. But Harvey has long been suspected of having been planted as a mole in the CIA by J. Edgar Hoover. Hemming says that this is true; Harvey reported back to Hoover. 3. According to Hemming, Angleton acted as his handler and formed Interpen teams in 1960 as quasi-“A” teams, drawing on former U.S. Special Forces. 4. According to John Scelso, Angleton took over the JFK assassination investigation, forcing Scelso out of the picture. 5. According to Anthony Summers, quoting Gordon Novel (electronics expert linked to the CIA), Angleton was one of those, along with the Mafia, who had compromising photographs of J. Edgar Hoover in a homosexual act with Clyde Tolson. 6. The literature is replete with accounts of Angleton’s paranoia about Communist moles in the CIA. And Angleton was very much inclined, at least by the appearance of his actions, to be in sympathy with the right-wing clique in the military and the CIA. 7. There is growing evidence that Angleton sent Oswald to Russia. 8. Angleton himself has been accused by a fellow CIA officer, Clare Petty, of being a Soviet mole. Petty had made an exhaustive, highly praised investigation of Angleton over a period of years. William Colby fired Angleton from the CIA when Colby was appointed as director, because he felt that Angleton had almost destroyed the CIA in his mole hunts. Angleton never found a mole. Curiously, he overlooked British double agent Kim Philby, who was very close to Angleton and ultimately was found to be a Soviet mole by William Harvey. The question is: was Angleton really trying to find moles, or was his fanaticism about moles a cover for being a mole himself? 9. According to John Scelso, Angleton became involved with the Mafia. Scelso said that Angleton protected them. As he was dying, Angleton softly told his wife, “I’ve made so many mistakes.” What can be concluded about Angleton? Probably nothing yet, except that Angleton seemed to know everything. The final chapter of the Angleton mystery may someday be written. Where will he fit in the picture? The number of scenarios that can be created around Angleton are endless. He has even been accused of being a mole for Israel. Angleton did have the Israel desk at CIA, and Israel’s Mossad has been linked to Meyer Lansky, who, along with Trafficante, had lost millions in Cuba when Castro took over. One can imagine almost anything about Angleton. For myself, however, I will stay with a more mundane theory: President Kennedy was killed by a few of his political enemies in the U.S. (civilian and military), in partnership with the Mafia, with the blessings of Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover."},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"Hemming’s statement that Interpen was one of several quasi-“A” teams created by Angleton reminded me of what Colonel Fletcher Prouty had told me: The U.S. government had created several special assassination teams having world-wide applications; and powerful civilian forces (the elusive High Cabal) had direct access to these teams for their own purposes, bypassing the entire U.S. defense and intelligence apparatus, including Allen Dulles himself, and the Joint Chiefs. (Perhaps through someone like William Pawley.) At the end of the second day in Fort Lauderdale, we were waiting for Hemming’s daughter Delores to bring his notes on my chapter. Finally, at about 5:00 pm, not only did his daughter arrive, but also his wife Patti. This was a surprise to me, to say the least. After being introduced and while I was packing my briefcase, Hemming said to his wife, “Patti, tell Noel where we were when we got the news on that day.” Mrs. Hemming spoke with obvious sincerity, “Gerry and I were at our home on Just Island. We were listening to the radio commentary about the motorcade when I heard about firecrackers going off. I said that this was bad for someone to be doing that. Then we heard that Kennedy had been shot. Right away we went over to Alan Kennedy’s house, about one or two hundred yards away, to watch television—we didn’t have a television set. After watching for awhile, Gerry went on with Alan to somewhere, but I don’t know where.” Hemming then said to her, “Tell him about November 18.” She said, “Gerry went to the airport in Miami on November 18 with Little Joe after calling Steve Wilson. They left from Little Joe’s house. Little Joe had a weapon. Later, Little Joe told me he was close enough to Kennedy that day to kill him, and he would have killed him if he weren’t the president.” She added that she and Gerry were with “the guys” at Little Joe’s house that evening. I then asked her where Gerry was between November 18 and 22. She at first hesitated, but after some prodding from Gerry, she went through a reconstruction of events that I didn’t understand, and concluded that Gerry must have been in Miami during that time. Then she went back to November 22, remembering that Little Joe was so happy that Kennedy had been killed that he was “dancing in the street” with yells of delight. She said that this upset her, and she called him on it. Gerry then said to her, “When we came back from Little Joe’s on November 22, do you remember that we went by Felipe’s house and the lights were on, about 5:30 in the evening?” She seemed to hesitate on that, but nodded. Gerry said, “As I remember, I went into Felipe’s house alone for a few minutes to say hello to him.” She didn’t say anything to that. She then brought up the subject of Ed Collins. She said, “I remember that I overheard Collins once saying that he had a gun and he was going to go kill Gerry.” At this point my briefcase was packed, so I borrowed a pen from Delores and wrote down a list of notes from which I later composed the above conversation. I read back the notes to Mrs. Hemming to be certain that I had understood what she had said. She concurred that I had. Fonzi and I then left to return to my hotel, where my wife was waiting. On the way, Fonzi said, “When you meet the family, you become much more sympathetic, don’t you?” I replied, “You better believe it!” As I reflected back over the many months, I remembered something that at the time seemed very significant, but, incredibly, had been lost in the clutter of my mind (Anna Marie reminded me of it). When Hemming was handing out documents to me on that Sunday in San Diego, he gave me a copy of his application to the CIA, which had been left in the CIA files with no action taken. He said that this was “just a formality so that the CIA could claim they had no association with me.” Hemming called my attention to one item in the CIA application, under “references”: KLEINS—227 W. Washington St., Chicago, Illinois Hemming said, “What do you make of that?” I said, “It reminds me of the Kleins’ sporting goods store where Oswald purchased the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.” Hemming said, “That’s right, I worked for"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"Kleins for a short period in the late ’50s. At the time, this bit of evidence was overwhelmed by everything else he was telling me. But later Anna Marie admonished me, “Come on now, isn’t that a coincidence! Here is Hemming, knowing Oswald, and just happening to have once worked at Kleins.” I agreed. It was a very big coincidence. Hemming had told me that he had available to him blank identification cards for the Air Force and Navy. I thought of the witness who said that Hargraves had false Secret Service credentials before he went to Dallas in late 1963. Then I thought of Oswald’s false identification card in the name of “A. J. Hidell.” And Hemming giving me a short course on how to forge identification cards. This was all too much. Before setting up the meeting in Fort Lauderdale, I had asked Hemming to try to arrange for Roy Hargraves to participate for four hours. (I had no way of locating Hargraves. He was on the move, according to Hemming.) Hemming said that Hargraves was due in Miami, and had previously received requests for interviews with Weberman but couldn’t reach an agreement on a price. This was the first time that anyone had requested money from me for an interview. After much agonizing, I decided to offer Hargraves $500 for four hours, with the condition that all he had to do was review what I had written about him, and give his comments, yes or no. He would not be asked to add any new material unless he wanted to do so. Hemming told me before I left San Diego that he would pass this message on to Hargraves. But Hargraves never showed up. Hemming said that he had left the message, and it was up to Hargraves, and he wasn’t going to pursue him. Key Points in Chapters 27 and 28 1. The most compelling evidence of all are the nine people who predicted the assassination, in particular how Eugene B. Dinkin and Joseph Milteer described in advance the basic concept and composition of the plot. By examining the backgrounds of these nine people and John Martino, we see a skeletal outline of the complete plot. 2. Richard Case Nagell has been proven a very truthful witness in virtually everything he said. The people who have attempted to discredit him over the years should take second thought. His story has been corroborated in various parts by Colonel William Bishop, Robert Morrow, Gerald Patrick Hemming, General Fabian Escalante, and by all other evidence and information that I have been able to accumulate. Recall that Nagell was adamant that the FBI was behind the Kennedy assassination, and that it was a domestic plot. 3. Robert Morrow’s story has been proven to be correct in many respects. Morrow seems to have been involved in a different group of Cuban exiles (Mario Garcia Kohly’s group) than that which was ultimately active in the assassination. Morrow himself has quoted Kohly as denying to his deathbed that he was involved in the plot, and that seems to be supported by the facts. There are still loose ends as to how Morrow’s story of Eladio del Valle overlaps into the Hemming/Interpen story. 4. The Marita Lorenz story of the car caravan to Dallas remains a conundrum. Her story has serious flaws. It boils down to her word against Hemming’s, or neither telling the full truth. Some of the story may be disinformation put out by the CIA. 5. Following the leads given by Cuban General Fabian Escalante concerning Felipe Vidal, Colonel William Bishop, and Herminio Diaz, we have for the first time evidence of the Texas right wing plotting to kill President Kennedy, working with a CIA colonel (William Bishop),"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"retired Army generals (Walker and Willoughby), anti-Castro Cubans, and Hemmings’ No Name Key assassination team and his associates. 6. The John Martino story and his confession are of utmost importance, particularly when the material in this chapter is added. They link together the Mafia, Cuban exile Felipe Vidal Santiago, Gerald Patrick Hemming, his man Ronald Ponce De Leon, and William Pawley into a cohesive picture of a vital phase of the JFK assassination. 7. Hemming’s Interpen group and his other associates, with or without him, seem to have played important roles in the operational-execution phase of the plot, if not in the actual killing. Hemming’s claim that he lost control of his people and they went ahead without him is not totally implausible. According to Hemming, he found himself after the JFK assassination amidst some of the people who he thought were involved, but no one was talking to anybody about anything. As Hemming said to me, “It’s just not done.” Only time may tell us the full truth, if ever. But we are getting very close to understanding the broad structure of the master plot. Hemming’s Interpen group and their associates could well have performed ancillary functions, such as handling Oswald, providing diversionary and backup shooters, getaway cars and aircraft, spotters, et cetera. We must realize that assassination of the president of the United States in a crossfire operation requires more than two people. As noted in Chapter 15, Mafia hits sometimes employed up to twenty people in the total operation. Researchers generally estimate somewhere around ten people were required, just at Dealey Plaza, to staff the operation. These people had to come from somewhere. They didn’t materialize from Mars. And where would the master plotters go to recruit them? Except for the primary shooters, it is unlikely that foreigners would be brought in, unless they had a good command of the English language and could blend in as Americans. Most likely, based on the evidence presented, it would seem that Hemming’s Interpen group and their English-speaking associates, along with a few Cuban exiles, would be prime candidates to make up the team that was necessary in both Dealey Plaza and Mexico City for performance of the ancillary functions. Although the available evidence does not prove this beyond a reasonable doubt, it is the best scenario that I have seen, and could well pass a preponderance of evidence test before a jury, in my opinion. 8. The operational-execution phase of the plot was carried out with less sophisticated planning than I originally hypothesized. In many ways, it was an amateurish, botched job. Only by having extremely powerful sponsors with the capacity to cover up the crime for decades did the plot succeed, and everybody go free. When I first suggested to Hemming that the Dealey Plaza and Mexico City operations in the plot were amateurish, he seemed startled, even offended. But months later, Hemming himself was saying that it was an amateurish job in Dealey Plaza, that “it looked like a Frank Sturgis operation.” 9. None of the above precludes Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover from having been informed in advance that President Kennedy would be assassinated when he came to Dallas; nor are the French Corsican/OAS assassination teams, recruited by the Mafia (or William Harvey or the Texas right wing), excluded as the primary shooters. *** In the course of my conversations with Hemming over the months, there were several areas that he brought out that require further investigation beyond the scope of my time now available. One is the Jack Lawrence story, earlier discussed in outline. It could be critical. This is now being researched by Sheldon Inkol in Toronto, Canada. Another is the story of the Nash Rambler that picked up two men fleeing the Texas School Book"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"Depository immediately after the assassination, noted in Chapter 3. Hemming suspects that this automobile was owned by his associate and Interpen member Howard K. Davis, but had been seized by the Mexican police when Davis had loaned the car to Dick Whatley and Bob Willis, who were arrested in Mexico in 1962 in a gun-running operation to Guatemala. They were held in jail for six months and then set free through Hemming’s efforts in obtaining assistance from General Edwin Walker. Hemming said he suspects that this car showed up on November 22 at Dealey Plaza. Richard Bartholomew in Pfleurgerville, Texas, is doing research on this subject. I put Hemming in touch with him and they are exchanging information. *** Epilogue On June 13, 1997, I received a package of 778 pages of documents concerning Hemming from the Assassination Records Review Board that I had been waiting for. Some of them were very important. First, Patricia Orr’s notes, on which I based a large part of this chapter, were included in final typewritten form, verifying their validity as official documents. Second, in this document [596] was an item that almost certainly verified that Hemming had been telling me the truth about Vidal being in Dallas on November 22: CONFIDENTIAL: Felipe Vidal Santiago reportedly visits Dallas without permission of INS: 11/21 Vidal reportedly still trying to raise money If Vidal left Miami by auto on the evening of November 18, he would be arriving in Dallas by November 21 (it was a two- or three-day drive in those days). Apparently, Vidal was required by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to notify them when leaving Miami. The trip to Dallas by auto, combined with Vidal not notifying the INS, looked like an attempt to keep the trip secret. Vidal’s return to Dallas by plane on November 22 (arriving at his home in Miami by 5:30 p.m. Miami time, as Hemming told me) would very likely have been by private or military jet to have been accomplished within the four hours from the time of the assassination, considering time to and from airports on both ends. I talked to Hemming about this by telephone on June 15, 1997, and he explained that Vidal was on partial parole at the time; thus his need to notify the INS. Hemming agreed that the return flight by private plane was an indication of a secret trip. But he disagreed that leaving Miami without INS permission was an indication of secrecy—Vidal did that all the time. Another document [597] of even more interest was an HSCA outside contact report, dated 1/10/78: Mike Epstein of the Senate Intelligence Committee called to re lay information that he had received from Jerry Treanor, attorney in Washington, DC, for Jorge Antonio Zimeri-Safie, a Cuban wanted for extradition to Guatemala on a murder charge. Epstein said Treanor had told him that Zimeri had information pertinent to the Kennedy assassination. I called Treanor at his law office and he told me the following: He said his client has known Gerry Patrick Hemming for several years, perhaps since 1971. Hemming told Zimeri that he met Oswald in Atsugi, Japan, when they were both stationed there with the United States Marines. Hemming also reportedly told Zimeri in bragadaccio [ sic ] manner that he, Hemming, had been part of the third back-up team in the Kennedy assassination and was in a building somewhere behind the TSBD at the time of the shooting. Treanor said the information was first revealed to a Washington, D.C. homicide detective who questioned Zimeri regarding the Orlando Letelier case. Treanor said this predated the allegations made publicly by Marita Lorenz in September 1976. "},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"Treanor also had other information about Hemming. He said that he had learned from an “unimpeachable source” that Hemming had served with the U.S. Marines from April 1954 until October 1958 and in the United States Navy & Navy Reserve from October 1963 until October 1969. Our records indicate Hemming only served in the Marines during the same period of time Treanor claims. We have no record that Hemming was in the Navy at any time. Treanor also know other details of Hemming’s Marine Corps training including his experience as a link trainer instructor and aircraft instructor. He said he had learned from DEA that Hemming was presently involved in an operation whereby heroin is smuggled into the country by parachuting into the Miami area at night with heroin from Columbia; also that Hemming is involved with Medivac, a mercenary outfit that uses paratroopers and other Special Forces trained men to parachute into isolated emergency areas, such as those hit by hurricane or floods, to help the locals in Central or South American countries... (Emphasis added) What interested me here is Hemming’s reportedly telling that he had been part of a third back-up team and in a building somewhere behind the School Book Depository at the time of the shooting. This reminded me of repeated conversations in San Diego with Hemming about the origin of the shots. Hemming was adamant, seeming to be absolutely certain, almost as if he had been there, that some of the shots came from the Dal-Tex building on the fourth floor—the offices of Abraham Zapruder. (The Dal- Tex building is where Mafioso Jim Braden had been at the time of the shooting, before he was picked up by the Dallas Police as he was leaving the building, and then let go.) In our telephone conversation on June 15, I asked Hemming about this. After some hesitation, he said that Jorge Zimeri had been told this story by John Martino to protect him (Hemming) from being murdered in Guatemala by Zimeri, with whom Hemming was involved in a plot to overthrow the government of Guatemala. The idea, Hemming explained, was that if Zimeri believed that Hemming had been part of the JFK assassination, he would fear he would create such a ruckus in the U.S. that he wouldn’t get away with it. (Although the idea of Hemming in a plot to overthrow Guatemala may seem fanciful, it is true—a long story, complicated, beyond the scope of this book, but supported by government documents.) What Hemming didn’t explain was why the document made no mention of John Martino. Also, note that Hemming could have been part of the third back-up team, but still have been in Miami on November 22. In a later telephone conversation on July 12, 1997, Hemming denied that he had ever made such a statement to Zimeri. As to Hemming having been in the U.S. Navy from October 1963 to October 1969, he explained to me that this was probably something Angleton did for him—that Angleton had promised him he “would take care of him”—presumably for retirement pay. I asked, “Does this mean Naval Intelligence?” He responded weakly, “Yes.” He apparently didn’t want to talk about this. I was tired, so I didn’t press it further. A document of considerable interest in the package was a four-page summary [598] of a deposition of Hemming taken on March 21, 1978 by the HSCA. One item read: Hemming met Jack Ruby, in September or October, 1959, at William Morgan’s house in Cuba. Ruby sold inferior jeeps in the Cuban Air force, and Hemming had a few choice words about them. They were filmed [in Morgan’s house] by Clete Roberts on Channel 13 in Los Angeles. This was disturbing to me because I had asked Hemming in San Diego if he had known Jack Ruby, and he replied that he had not. Now I was learning that, under oath, he had testified that he met Ruby in 1959. Perhaps I didn’t ask the right question. I asked Hemming about this in the telephone conversation and, sure enough, he immediately said, “You didn’t ask me if I met Ruby, you asked me if I knew him.” Foiled again! In the telephone conversation, Hemming admitted to another item in the summary that quoted him"},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"saying he had met Jack Ruby briefly at the Carousel Club for about sixty seconds in 1963. He said that he had been introduced to Ruby by Wally Welch; “...we were having a couple of beers, [Howard K.] Davis was with me, and he was sitting there banging on some bongos or something and he came over...and said that he was brought over by Wally Welch. He introduced us to him...” Another entry in the deposition summary: Upon leaving Cuba in September, 1960, he stayed in Mexico City for two weeks and had contact with Silvia Duran. The following notation was in a memorandum [599] to Jim Garrison from Steven J. Burton, one of his investigators, dated May 8, 1969, re: Interview with Gerald Patrick Hemming, 2668 Hoyt Ave., El Monte, Calif., in the company of Lawrence Howard. PATRICK said that he recalls that a pilot named BILL BURCHETTE flew him, FRANK BARTES, LUIS RABEL, RICARDO DAVIS, and others to the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain to scout the area for a possible training camp. He said that BURCHETTE knew BARTES well and lived at that time in Metairie. As you know, a man named BILL BURCHETTE was evidently closely associated with EDGAR EUGENE BRADLEY”S apparent activity at Van Nuys Airport... Edgar Eugene Bradley was one of Jim Garrison’s prime suspects whom he tried to extradite (unsuccessfully) from California. Governor Ronald Reagan denied the request. Garrison has been highly criticized for this. His critics say that Garrison had mistaken Eugene Bradley for Eugene Hale Brading, A.K.A. Jim Braden, Mafioso. Curiously, Braden also went by the name Harry Eugene Bradley. The real Eugene Bradley was a right-wing extremist in Los Angeles. In an interview [600] with Lawrence Howard by Steven Burton, Howard said that he once met Gene Bradley at a house where a paramilitary organization held meetings and prepared ammunition. Howard said that Mr. Bradley “believed in action,” was “a doer and not a talker.” Jim Braden has also been reported as associated with radical right-wing groups in Los Angeles. I asked Hemming about this flight with Burchette, and his response was, “What year was it?” I told him I would have to refer to the document to get the year, and the conversation then shifted to another subject. In a later telephone conversation, Hemming told me that this flight did occur, but passengers on the flight were Howard K. Davis, Larry LaBorde, and himself. He said that it was a Civil Air Patrol four- passenger plane. In Burton’s interview with Hemming was another item: PATRICK said that he had met CLINT MURCHISON, GORDON McLENDON, and NELSON HUNT at various meetings in Dallas. The purpose of these meetings was to raise funds for raids into Cuba. Often at these meetings, there was talk of killing KENNEDY, but he can recall no specific instance where MURCHISON, McLENDON, or HUNT participated in this talk. Hemming had never told me about meeting Clint Murchison or Gordon McLendon in Dallas, but he had mentioned meeting with Nelson Bunker Hunt. I asked him about this in the telephone conversation, and he responded, “Well, these were the people who were standing around in the July 5, 1963 meeting at the Petroleum Club. I’m not asking their names or what have you. A number of these people who were running their mouths off to us, I guess McLendon was there. He seemed familiar to me, and I ran into him some time later.” I asked, “What about Murchison?” He responded, “Yes, he probably was at the July 5th meeting.” I replied, “I know you’ve been reluctant to name any of the people who were in that meeting.” He said, “In most cases, I didn’t want to know who they were.” I said, “I can see why you wouldn’t.” He replied, “They weren’t volunteering their names.” I asked, “But you can’t say for sure that Murchison and"},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"McLendon were at the meeting in the Petroleum Club with you?” He answered, “I wouldn’t be surprised if they were there. From running into him [McLendon] at a later date, he seemed familiar and he might have even made reference to Lester Logue or someone else at the meeting.” Another notation in the Burton memorandum: PATRICK also advised that ED COLLINS and ENRIQUE MOLINA (a Castro Spy) were in Dallas during November, 1963. Recall that Ed Collins is the one whom Weberman accused Hemming of murdering, and it was Ed Collins that Mrs. Hemming told me had threatened to murder her husband. The Burton memorandum ended with this: No doubt, PATRICK did not provide anything near the total of information known by him. His knowledge of anti-Castro activities in the early 1960s is extensive, to say the least. His contacts in Miami, New Orleans, Dallas, and to a lesser extent, Los Angeles, are considerable. His instant recollection of names and places is admirable. But it was obvious that he was determined not to help the investigation in any way. He would constantly begin a long description of some raid or preparations that I had not asked about and that was obviously irrelevant. As [Lawrence] HOWARD had warned me, I only got that information that PATRICK was willing to give me. In short, I don’t trust him and am in no way convinced that he did not work for the CIA. Hemming hadn’t changed much by 1997. Another memorandum [601] to Garrison from his investigator Steven Burton, dated August 8, 1968, re: meeting with Lawrence Howard: HOWARD then disclosed, after requesting that the tape recorder be stopped, that RORKE, HEMMING, WILSON, and/or DAVIS were in Mexico “at the same time someone else was.” It was obvious while questioning him further that he was referring to OSWALD’S trip in late September, 1963 although he was uncertain of the time. He further said that RORKE’S plane crashed in Mexico in 1963 and identified RORKE as a free-lance writer with both Castro ties and anti-Castro ties... I asked Hemming about this, and he replied, “No, I don’t think so. Our first trip to Mexico was a search for Alexander Rorke, which would have been in the latter part of October or the first week in November.” This reminded me of A. J. Weberman’s accusation that Hemming had been the one who handled Oswald in Mexico City, which Hemming had ducked answering when I questioned him about it in an earlier interview. Another item noted that Hemming testified that he was approached by the mob in the Fontainbleu Hotel to kill Castro. I asked Hemming about this, and he said, “That was in 1961. June of 1961, I think it was.” One last note. In a memorandum [602] from Gaeton Fonzi to Robert Tanenbaum dated June 5, 1977, quoting A. J. Weberman, who had just spent about ten hours talking with Hemming: Hemming, says Weberman, has over 400 pages of documents he obtained from the FBI, CIA, and Secret Service under the Freedom of Information Act. Among them are applications by Hemming for the CIA and documents which show Hemming did work as a contract agent. His FBI case officer, when he was working for the Bureau, was James O’Connor, who, says Hemming, is now in San Diego. Fonzi had never mentioned this to me. I asked Hemming about it, and he said, “That was in 1961.” I"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"replied, “So that’s why you were a so-called informant, right? What did you do for the FBI?” Hemming said, “O’Connor handled KGB agents, Castro agents, and he was inquiring into who was dealing with Raul Castro, getting spare parts for Cuba right up to, before, and after the Bay of Pigs.” This reminded me of Oswald, who almost certainly was an FBI informant. It made me wonder about Hemming’s claim that Hoover was trying to set him (Hemming) up, if he had been an FBI recruit. And I thought it could explain the FBI’s not going after him with all the evidence they had against him in the JFK assassination. Perhaps their number-one rule of “not embarrassing the Bureau” was in full effect, or Hoover simply didn’t know that Hemming and Oswald were FBI informants. In reviewing all of the documents in the package, it was apparent that Hemming had been telling his story, in general, going back to 1967, about right wingers in Texas and New Orleans suggesting that JFK be killed and seeking someone to do it, but not nearly in as much detail as he told me and Fonzi. I had thought months earlier after interviewing Hemming that he was a master of obfuscation and cover stories. I wondered if he were not applying the strategy that “the best defense is a good offense.” How else to explain his bold entrance, with Hargraves, into Jim Garrison’s office in 1967 to “help him in the case”? Fonzi’s “Carlos,” an undoubted CIA agent, had done the same thing and has been suspected of injecting himself into the Garrison case as a “consultant” with the objective of undermining Garrison’s investigation. Of the 95 documents I requested from the ARRB, many were not available, having been referred to other agencies. Also, Hemming’s deposition was not in the package, just the summary. One document referred to eleven volumes on Hemming. There is apparently much, much more to be learned about Hemming. The more documents I get and the more I talk with Hemming, the more I become convinced that he was involved more deeply in the JFK assassination than he is willing to admit. *** In telephone conversations on July 6 and 7, 1997, reconfirmed on July 21, 1997, Hemming opened up a new Pandora’s box. He told me that he had inadvertently helped in the planning of Oswald’s trip to Mexico City, but he claimed innocence of knowing that the planning involved Oswald. He said that, under instructions from Angleton, he provided know-how to Alexander Rorke [603] as to methods of inserting an agent into Cuba. He said that Rorke, along with pilot Geoffrey Sullivan, left Florida in a light, twin- engine, five-passenger Beechcraft airplane. They flew to New Orleans and picked up Oswald, then flew him to Austin for the Selective Service meeting, then to Dallas for the Odio incident, then to Harlinger, Texas, for plane refueling, then on to Mirada, Mexico, where Oswald stayed while someone else was posing as him in Mexico City. The Oswald impersonator attempted to obtain a visa for Oswald to get into Cuba from Mirada. Hemming said the operation in Mexico City was bungled by Winston Scott; Oswald, unable to enter Cuba, was returned to Dallas. Hemming said Oswald was never in Mexico City and the appearance of trips to and from there was fabricated. This is another subject that requires more research before conclusions can be reached. However, a document (NARA 180-0068-10492), about the search party for Rorke and Sullivan, headed by Hemming in a DC-3, does show that the timing of the Rorke flight and its layover in Mirada is consistent with Oswald’s trip to Mexico City and Hemming’s story. If true, this implicates Angleton in Oswald’s trip to Mexico City, and the framing of Oswald in the Odio visit! It is another example of Hemming seeming to be in the plot but claiming innocence of direct involvement. This could be Hemming’s cover story for having told Weberman in a confessional moment that he helped set up Oswald; or it could be a valid explanation of that statement. My final conclusions about Hemming are in Chapter 32, “Author’s Conclusions.”"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"PART 5: CONSPIRACY AND COVER-UP IN WASHINGTON, D.C."},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"Cassius: For who so firm that cannot be seduced? William Shakespeare Julius Caesar 29 THE SECRET SERVICE It staggers the mind even to contemplate that the entire Secret Service contingency in Dallas and high officials of the Secret Service in Washington, D.C., were involved in an orchestrated conspiracy to kill the president. And what would have been the motive for the Secret Service to participate in the conspiracy? Plausible scenarios to enable us to grapple with these questions are, first, any participation from the Secret Service may have involved only a few key agents with limited knowledge of the plot who manipulated other agents; and, second, those key agents could have been susceptible to bribery. After all, the potential for bribery of government employees is enormous, particularly those who are close to the seats of power and are witness to its frequent hypocrisy and sham. Many of these people are of modest means, draw a meager salary, and are subject to being servants to the personal whims of the powerful. It is small wonder that some of them might be tempted by the promise of protection from prosecution and large sums of money in untraceable bills. In this regard, it seems reasonable to assume that there were a few key people in the Secret Service who could have been approached by others in the conspiracy and brought into it through the persuasion of bribery. [604] These people were well aware of John Kennedy’s flagrant philandering and probably knew much more about him that could have led to disdain for him. There are stories of John Kennedy using the Secret Service to arrange for his liaisons with women—inside and outside the White House—and of using agents to do menial chores, act as “go-fers” and “lookouts,” and perform other demeaning tasks. [605] It is worth remembering that until Kennedy came along, the Secret Service was protecting Dwight Eisenhower and before that Harry Truman and before that Franklin D. Roosevelt. All of these men, even with their individual transgressions, were paragons of virtue who commanded great personal respect compared to the reckless Jack Kennedy. In addition to the possibility of bribery combined with loss of respect, there is some evidence of conflict between the Secret Service and Kennedy. In his book The Third Alternative, Vincent M. Palamara wrote that Secret Service agent Abraham Bolden (to be discussed later) told him that he had heard “there was some conflict between Kennedy and the White House Detail, that he was trying to scale them back.” [606] Palamara wrote that, “Most importantly, JFK retired/fired the top five Secret Service/Treasury Department officials [including the chief of the Secret Service, U. E. Baughman], coinciding with the dismissal of the top three CIA officials.” [607] Suffice it to say, there appear to have been enough motives for us to consider that at least key individuals of the Secret Service could have been brought into one compartment of the plot. But having said that, we still need substantial evidence of the Secret Service’s complicity in the JFK assassination before reaching such conclusions. Much of this evidence has been reported in previous chapters in this book, the most salient of which I will outline briefly in the paragraphs that follow, along with new material. First, we will examine the evidence of the selection of the fatal motorcade route. Did the Secret Service play a vital role in that decision? The final decision to have the motorcade pass by the Texas School Book Depository building was not made until November 18, 1963, only four days before the assassination. [608] Jerry Bruno, JFK’s advance man for the Dallas trip, wrote in his book The Advance Man that he had considerable conflict with John"},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"Connally [609] concerning the location of a luncheon speech that Kennedy was to give on November 22. Two locations were considered, one at the Dallas Trade Mart and the other at the Women’s Building auditorium at the state fairgrounds. Connally wanted the Dallas Trade Mart; this route would take the motorcade by the School Book Depository building after making a 110° turn, thereby unavoidably slowing the speed of the motorcade down to a crawl and placing it in a perfect location for assassination by crossfire (see Exhibit 28-2). The other option, the Women’s Building site preferred by Bruno, would have taken the motorcade two blocks further away from the School Book Depository building. The motorcade would proceed at a much faster rate of speed. Bruno wrote that “it would have been almost impossible for a sniper to hit him from the Depository.” [610] Bruno disagreed with Connally and protested to the Secret Service in Washington, D.C., advising them that security be used as the reason not to go to the Trade Mart; but Connally prevailed, traveling directly to the White House over Bruno’s head, adamantly insisting on the Trade Mart site. A “bitter feud” ensued, but on November 18 JFK’s man Ken O’Donnell called Bruno and said, “We’re going to let Dallas go, Jerry....We’re going to let Connally have the Trade Mart site.” [611] The die was now cast. Kennedy would be passing through Dealey Plaza down Elm Street at a very slow speed, in a perfect spot to conceal assassins at several possible locations—in surrounding tall buildings and behind fences, walls, and shrubs along Elm Street."},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"Exhibit 29-1.

This option was considered and rejected by the Secret Service. Another option that would have avoided Elm Street would have been to proceed straight down Main Street and beyond Dealey Plaza, thereby reaching the Trade Mart on Industrial Boulevard. This option was rejected because the area around Industrial Boulevard was “filled with winos and broken pavement....” (HSCA Vol. XI, p. 522) The X indicates the approximate location of the fatal shot. It is perhaps significant to note that both the School Book Depository Building and the Trade Mart were under the control of the conservative wing of the Democratic Party in Dallas. The Depository was owned by wealthy Texas oil man David Howard Bird. [612] The Trade Mart was controlled by the conservative Dallas Citizens’ Council, described as an oligarchy that ran the city. [613] Moreover, John Connally was LBJ’s man in Dallas and was beholden to H. L. Hunt for financial favors. [614] As earlier noted, LBJ was part of the big-money conservative faction of the Democratic Party of Dallas and had been supported heavily by H. L. Hunt in his election bid for the Democratic nomination against John Kennedy. With the motorcade passing slowly through Dealey Plaza, conditions would be perfect for the assassination (see Exhibit 28-2). Only by concerted pressure from John Connally did the Trade Mart get selected for the luncheon, making it possible to have the motorcade pass through the crossfire ambush. Would Connally have set himself up in a crossfire at Dealey Plaza? Certainly not. Could Connally have been deceived into doing it? Plausibly, yes. Who could have deceived Connally? Most likely, it would reasonably seem, Lyndon Johnson. I want to make it clear that I have not seriously considered that John Connally was a conscious part of the plot. There are several reasons for this: First, Connally would not likely have been so stupid as to allow himself to be used to set up the death trap if he were a knowing part of the plot; the finger of accusation inevitably would have pointed directly to him, and he certainly would have known that. Second, he was most stalwart in contending over the years, until his death, that he was hit by a second bullet, which undermined the Warren Commission’s thesis of one gunman. Lastly, it would not seem"},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"reasonable that a well-planned plot would have a key high official in its conspiratorial group aggressively arranging a parade route that was so patently perfect for an assassination. In fact, having Connally arrange the parade route and then having him in the line of fire would serve as a means to divert suspicion away from the right-wing plotters in Dallas; the ploy being, would they expose one of their own to such danger? [615] (As noted earlier, a similar ploy may have been used by the right wing in a staged assassination attempt on General Walker by Oswald.) Another reason to suspect that the selection of the Trade Mart for the luncheon site was part of a plot was that it would be a backup assassination site to Dealey Plaza if that plan had to be aborted for some reason. Evidence supporting the reasoning that the Trade Mart was a back-up site is that John Adrian O’Hare (a.k.a. Colonel William Bishop, a professional sniper assigned to the CIA from Army intelligence) was stationed at the Trade Mart on November 22. (See Chapter 27.) Also, the Trade Mart was a difficult building in which to protect the president due to its architecture, having a large number of entrances and exits and multiple catwalks above the floor, whereas the Women’s Auditorium was a single-floor building with only two entrances at either end. [616] The Trade Mart would have been a very good spot for an assassin to conceal himself and escape afterwards. The final step fell into place on November 18 when Ken O’Donnell yielded to Connally. This occurred after Oswald had accepted his job at the School Book Depository on October 15 with the strangely aggressive help of Ruth Paine, who was advised by a friend that there was a job opening there. It has always been a mystery as to the peculiar coincidence of Oswald getting a job at the School Book Depository in a time convenient for the assassination. Researchers over the years have tried to break down the Ruth Paine story, but to no avail. She had mentioned to her friend, Mrs. Lennie May Randall, that Oswald was looking for a job, and Mrs. Randall had told her that she had heard from her brother, Wesley Frazier, that there was an opening at the Book Depository. Ruth Paine then called the Book Depository and talked with Roy Truly, the superintendent. He confirmed that there was an opening and Oswald was hired the next day. This was all apparently a pure coincidence, but researchers are still looking for clues pertaining to the Paines and their associates to see if somehow this could have been arranged as part of the plot. But I would suggest that if this were a coincidence, it has a plausible explanation: The plot that killed Kennedy was designed to be very pragmatic. We have discussed in previous chapters that there were plots to kill Kennedy in Miami, Chicago, and Los Angeles that did not materialize for one reason or another. Similarly, the plot in Dallas could have been planned for several locations depending on how everything came together. In this scenario, Oswald would be maneuvered to any of the assassination sites found necessary—the Trade Mart as an example. After October 15, when Oswald took his job at the School Book Depository, the plotters must have been delighted because now all they had to do was have John Connally (unaware that there was an assassination plot) insist on the Trade Mart site for the luncheon and the motorcade could then be scheduled to pass into the perfect location at a slow speed through Dealey Plaza. Another possibility to consider is that the Trade Mart could have been the original choice for the assassination site, and when Oswald took the job at the Book Depository the plotters saw their opportunity and changed the plan to have Kennedy killed in Dealey Plaza—better not to attract attention to the Dallas Citizens’ Council who controlled the Trade Mart. But in any case, we must conclude from the foregoing evidence that it does not appear that the Secret Service was the primary instrument for arranging the fatal motorcade route. It was John Connally, likely under the persuasion of the plotters. This does not imply, however, that key persons in the Secret Service were not aware of the importance of the motorcade route to the plot. In point of fact, they did go along with it without serious resistance, later using the excuse that they had yielded to the politicians in the selection of the route. The crimes of the Secret Service were crimes of omission; their role was not to do"},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"certain critical things. As Colonel Fletcher Prouty wrote, all that is needed to get a president assassinated is to compromise the Secret Service—get them to let down their guard—and someone, fanatic or conspirator, will come forth to do the deed. From the day that John Kennedy was murdered, it has been widely accepted that the performance of the Secret Service was unbelievably lax, before and after the shooting. The most basic rules of presidential protection were violated. No effort was made to guard against rifle fire from tall buildings. No effort was made to see that windows were closed in tall buildings along the parade route, even at Dealey Plaza where the president would be most vulnerable. Moreover, no effort was made to secure the area behind the picket fence and wall on the grassy knoll. No effort was made to check that area or station a Secret Service agent or a Dallas policeman there. We know from the sworn testimony of Lee Bowers, a railroad switchman who was in the railroad control house behind the Texas School Book Depository building (and who could clearly view the area behind the picket fence), that there was a great deal of activity going on, with strange cars coming in and out and strange people behind the fence. A single Secret Service agent located there could have prevented the assassination. But there were none, only some people who had bogus Secret Service identifications. As discussed in Chapters 11 and 12, the failure of the Secret Service agents, with the one exception of agent Clint Hill, to respond at all when the first round of gunfire occurred defies explanation other than in sinister terms. According to the Zapruder film, six to seven seconds elapsed after the first sound of gunfire before the presidential limousine sped up. And for that entire time all of the agents’ feet were glued to the running boards of the cars behind the presidential limousine, with the one exception of Agent Hill. The first duty of a Secret Service agent is to protect the president by shielding him (using the agent’s body) at the instant of hearing gunfire. But Special Agent Kellerman sat on the passenger side of the presidential limousine looking straight ahead as if transfixed until after the fatal shot. He made no effort to vault over the back of the seat to shield either John Connally or the president or their wives as was his duty. The fact that the limousine slowed almost to a halt at the point of the fatal shot similarly defies credible explanation. And the fact that Secret Service agent William Greer told the Warren Commission that he was not looking at the president at the time of the fatal shot (Zapruder frames clearly show that he was) leads one to suspect that the Secret Service was aware that Kennedy was scheduled to be shot and that it deliberately cooperated in placing him in a deadly crossfire. The question becomes not whether certain key persons in the Secret Service consciously led John Kennedy into a death trap, but rather, how was the total contingency assigned to protect him in Dallas brought into letting this happen? One explanation has been offered by writer Vincent Palamara. He postulates that a “security stripping test” was put into effect during the Dallas trip. Palamara bases this on statements by Secret Service Chief Rowley that studies were under way before the assassination about presidential security protection. In this scenario, many of the agents may have been led to believe that there was going to be a staged, fake assassination attempt, possibly as part of a covert operation to precipitate an invasion of Cuba, and that they were not to respond. This is in line with other theories by serious researchers that the entire disinformation phase of the plot was based on informing participants that there would be a fake assassination attempt on Kennedy when he went to Dallas. This scenario was mentioned to Gary Shaw by Colonel William Bishop. It does make some sense to explain how so many people could have been involved in the disinformation phase of the plot. It also could explain why Oswald was willing to be manipulated. But even if this scenario is true, there would still probably have to be one or two in the Secret Service who would be aware of the real plot and have the power to get all the other agents to keep their mouths shut. It seems entirely plausible that once the"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"assassination had taken place, the Secret Service agents who were in the presidential protection contingency realized immediately that their agency had been set up and became very frightened for their careers and of the powerful forces that were behind the plot. And, they all did keep their mouths shut, at least enough to keep it from the news media. Interviews with agents by various researchers over the years, however, indicate that many of the Secret Service agents did not believe there was a lone assassin, and were very troubled by what had happened. In that regard, both Special Agent Kellerman and Chief Rowley immediately commented after the shooting that it was a conspiracy. At one point in my studies this confused me because I thought that if they were that candid about believing it was conspiracy it was an indication that they were not involved in it. But after studying the Mexico City evidence, the Zapruder film, the testimonies of eyewitnesses, and thinking much more about the disinformation phase (for which it was obviously not planned that the shooting would appear to be the act of one person), it occurred to me that it would not be unreasonable to explain Kellerman’s and Rowley’s statements about a conspiracy as being no more than a continuation of the original intention of the plot—that it was supposed to look like a conspiracy involving Communists. Only after Oswald was captured and other things went wrong did the leaders of the plot decide pragmatically to switch to the lone-gunman story. This, as we know, gave the plotters grave problems because the evidence clearly showed more than one gunman. Added to the foregoing evidence of Secret Service complicity is their failure to send to their Dallas office information obtained on November 12, 1963 from Miami police informant William Somersett in a recording of a conversation between Somersett and Joseph Milteer, indicating that a plot was underway to assassinate the president with a high-powered rifle from a tall building. This information was sent to other Secret Service field offices but not to the Dallas office . [617] Additionally, according to Secret Service agent Abraham Bolden, [618] the Chicago Secret Service office received a teletype from the FBI shortly before Kennedy’s November 2 visit to Chicago warning that an assassination attempt would be carried out in that city by a four-man Cuban hit squad armed with high-powered rifles. Bolden said that the entire office was involved in this, but that it was kept top secret. [619] Kennedy’s trip to Chicago was canceled, but, again, that information was not transmitted to the Dallas office. After Kennedy’s death, Bolden discovered that the information about the Chicago threat was being kept from the Warren Commission, and he made a trip to Washington to tell them what he knew. But before he could tell his story, he was taken back to Chicago where he was charged with discussing a bribe with two counterfeiters, was brought to trial and convicted—even after one of the two counterfeiters admitted perjury. Bolden was sentenced to a prison term. The Secret Service admitted that the Chicago threat occurred but refused to clarify the matter. Bolden was subsequently released from prison. He claims that he was framed by the Secret Service and convicted in order to silence him regarding the Kennedy threat. [620] The HSCA concluded in its report: The fact was, however, that two threats to assassinate President Kennedy with high-powered rifles, both of which occurred in early November 1963, were not relayed to the Dallas region. [621] When the HSCA became involved in the investigation, it decided to take a closer look at Secret Service files to see if they contained what could have been recognized as significant threats in connection with the Dallas trip. The committee discovered that the 1963 Protective Research Section files had since been summarized and computerized, and the original files then destroyed . [622] "},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"The foregoing body of circumstantial evidence casts suspicion on, at the least, James Rowley (chief of the Secret Service) and Robert Bouck (head of the Protective Research Section). How can one rationally accept that these omissions and inactions were due to an oversight or incompetence? The Secret Service was not a large government bureaucracy. It was a small, tightly controlled group with only one hundred people in its Washington, D.C., contingency, and only about thirty of them worked directly on presidential protection. The primary assignment of the Secret Service is the protection of the president. How could this explicit, explosive information of an impending plot to kill the president, central to the Secret Service duties, have been overlooked? How could the complete failure to protect the president or to implement the most rudimentary procedures be reasonably attributable to laxity or incompetence? Several witnesses at the scene of the assassination reported encountering unexplained civilians who had Secret Service identification or Treasury Department identification. The HSCA took a quick look at this: After the assassination, several witnesses stated they had seen or encountered Secret Service agents behind the stockade fence situated on the grassy knoll area and in the Texas School Book Depository. Other witnesses reported Secret Service agents leaving the motorcade and running to various locations in Dealey Plaza. Warren Commission critics have alleged that these Secret Service agents either participated in the assassination itself or were involved in a cover-up of the evidence. [623] The problem with this information about other Secret Service agents in Dealey Plaza is that, according to the Warren Commission, they were not supposed to be there. The Commission clearly stated that there were no Secret Service agents at Dealey Plaza other than in the motorcade, and that those agents stayed in their places after the shooting (except for Clint Hill, who climbed on the back of the president’s limousine). The HSCA investigated this: Committee interviews or depositions with 11 of the 16 agents who were on duty with the motorcade and with their supervisors produced evidence that only one agent had left the motorcade at any time prior to the arrival at Parkland Hospital. This agent, Thomas “Lem” Johns, had been riding in Vice President Johnson’s follow-up car. In an attempt to reach Johnson’s limousine, he had left the car at the sound of shots and was momentarily on his own in Dealey Plaza, though he was picked up almost immediately and taken to Parkland Hospital. In every instance, therefore, the committee was able to establish the movement and the activities of Secret Service agents. Except for Dallas Agent-in-Charge Sorrels, who helped police search the Texas School Book Depository, no agent was in the vicinity of the stockade fence or inside the book depository on the day of the assassination. [624] (Emphasis added) Curiously, the HSCA attempted to explain this by stating that “ none of the witnesses interviewed by the committee were able to provide further corroboration concerning their original statements.” The committee’s explanation diminished considerably when its report continued with the following: One witness who did not base his Secret Service agent identification merely upon observing a plainclothesman in the presence of uniformed police officers was Dallas police officer Joseph M. Smith. Smith, who had been riding as a motorcycle escort in the motorcade, ran up the grassy knoll immediately after the shooting occurred. He testified to the Warren Commission that at that time he encountered a man who stated that he was a Secret Service agent and offered supporting credentials. Smith indicated that he did not examine these credentials closely, and he then proceeded to search"},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"the area unsuccessfully for suspicious individuals. [625] The HSCA report proceeded to reveal even further evidence of false Secret Service agents at Dealey Plaza who were military intelligence personnel but later had vanished from the records: The committee did obtain evidence that military intelligence personnel may have identified themselves as Secret Service agents or that they might have been misidentified as such. Robert E. Jones, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who in 1963 was commanding officer of the military intelligence region that encompassed Texas, told the committee that from 8 to 12 military intelligence personnel in plainclothes were assigned to Dallas to provide supplemental security for the President’s visit. He indicated that these agents had identification credentials and, if questioned, would most likely have stated that they were on detail to the Secret Service. The Committee sought to identify these agents so that they could be questioned. The Department of Defense, however, reported that a search of its files showed “no records...indicating any Department of Defense Protective Services in Dallas.” The committee was unable to resolve the contradiction. [626] Here we have possible suppression of evidence by Army intelligence, which we have seen became a habit with them, and the possible involvement of Army intelligence personnel in the assassination. Recall from Chapter 23 Colonel Fletcher Prouty’s reporting that the 112th Military Intelligence Division was told to “stand down” that day rather than report for duty in Dallas, over the protests of the unit commander. Now, in Dealey Plaza, we have indications of Army intelligence involvement in the form of bogus Secret Service agents. Another witness who encountered unexplained personnel flashing badges was Jean Hill, a school teacher in Dallas, who witnessed the Kennedy assassination from a position almost directly opposite the grassy knoll on Elm Street. She has told her story many times. She said she saw a muzzle flash, a puff of smoke, and a shadowy figure barely visible above the wooden picket fence at the top of the grassy knoll, “in the very act of murdering the president of the United States.” [627] She said that immediately after the shooting she saw a man in a brown coat running from the west end of the School Book Depository building toward the picket fence where he disappeared. She said she then ran toward the picket fence and when she got behind it she saw a uniformed policeman who seemed to be guarding something. She noticed what looked like a rifle in the policeman’s hand. Confused, she turned around and encountered a man in plain clothes who flashed a badge, taking a firm grip on her shoulder. She said she told the man she had to catch the man who was running away. “You’re not going anywhere,” the man snapped. “You’re coming with me. We want to talk to you.” “Leave me alone,” she howled, now on the verge of tears. “Don’t you understand? I’ve got to go catch this man. They’re getting away.” For one brief moment, she managed to break free. But before she could take more than two or three running steps, she was restrained by a second plainclothesman, whose grip on her other shoulder was even stronger than the first’s. “You’d better be still if you know what’s good for you,” he warned, as she slumped helplessly between them. Unceremoniously, the second man jammed his hand into her coat pocket and deftly withdrew the handful of still-damp Polaroid prints she had deposited there a few minutes before. “What are you doing?” Jean demanded. “Those are my pictures! Just who do you think you are?”"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"“We know who we are,” the man said roughly, shoving the pictures into his own jacket pocket. “The question is, who are you ? That’s what we’re going to find out, so just start walking and keep smiling—just like we were all real good friends. Otherwise, you’re in big trouble.” Jean Hill never saw the pictures again. She never found the man with the gun either, but she can close her eyes today and see him with the same distressing clarity as she could see him then. [628] Jean Hill testified before the Warren Commission on March 24, 1964 in lengthy testimony in which she told of seeing the man in the brown coat running away but she did not tell of seeing the muzzle flash or seeing the policeman with the rifle. Also, in her testimony, she said that she was embarrassed because before her testimony she had told others that she had seen a dog sitting between Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy in the limousine. She said she found out after she had made this statement that it couldn’t have been true because there was no dog there. She postulated that possibly she had seen a bunch of flowers instead of a dog. She was widely discredited for this. [629] Despite her disbelievers, Jean Hill has generally been considered to be a credible witness over the years. In person, Hill appears to be a very bright person and still teaches school in Dallas. To further illustrate the circuitous reporting of the HSCA, there is more testimony about Secret Service agents who shouldn’t have been at Dealey Plaza. Dallas policeman D. V. Harkness testified to the Warren Commission: Mr. Belin: Then you went around to the back of the building? Mr. Harkness: Yes, sir. Mr. Belin: Was anyone around in the back when you got there? Mr. Harkness: There was [ sic ] some Secret Service agents there. I didn’t get them identified. They told me they were Secret Service Agents. W.C. Vol. VI, p. 312 (Emphasis added) This testimony from a Dallas policeman! He must have been embarrassed that he didn’t ask them for their identification. This sounds like honest testimony. In addition, there was the testimony of Seymour Weitzman, Deputy Constable, Dallas County: Mr. Ball: What did you do then? Mr. Weitzman: I immediately ran toward the President’s car. Of course it was speeding away and somebody said the shots or the firecrackers, whatever it was at that time, we still didn’t know the President was shot, came from the wall. I immediately scaled that wall. Mr. Ball: What is the location of that wall? Mr. Weitzman: It would be between the railroad overpass and I can’t remember the name of that little street that runs off Elm; it’s cater-corner—the section there between the—what do you call it— the monument section? Mr. Ball: That’s where Elm actually dead ends? Mr. Weitzman: Yes, sir; I scaled the wall and, apparently, my hands rubbed steam pipes. I burned them. Mr. Ball: Did you go into the railroad yards? Mr. Weitzman: Yes, sir. Mr. Ball: What did you notice in the railroad yards? Mr. Weitzman: We noticed numerous kinds of footprints that did not make sense because they were going different directions. Mr. Ball: Were there other people there beside you? Mr. Weitzman: Yes, sir; other officers, Secret Service as well. W.C. Vol. VII, pp. 106-107"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"The foregoing is evidence from multiple witnesses that bogus Secret Service men were at Dealey Plaza. And it strongly suggests that the men may have been Army intelligence agents. Where did the bogus Secret Service agents get their identification badges? Were they provided by the Secret Service? Even if not, it is difficult to believe that the Secret Service would not have known of their presence. It seems inescapable that the Secret Service deliberately left the area behind the picket fence open for the shooters. To illustrate the improbability of an innocent explanation of the Secret Service’s performance, let us list the incredible string of coincidences that had to take place before Kennedy could be shot in Dealey Plaza and the crime blamed on Oswald: (1) It just happened that Oswald got his job in the Texas School Book Depository on October 15, arranged for by others. (2) It just happened that the Trade Mart site for the luncheon was selected on November 18 against the adamant recommendations of advance man Jerry Bruno. (3) It just happened that the parade route took the 110° turn in front of the School Book Depository Building when a route straight down Main Street would have avoided the perfect opportunity for crossfire and still have taken the motorcade to the Trade Mart. (4) It just happened that there was no effort made whatsoever to station security agents on the tall buildings around Dealey Plaza, or to see to it that all windows were closed, or to station an agent behind the shrubs and walls in Dealey Plaza. (5) It just happened that there were no Secret Service agents on the rear portion of the limousine to shield the president. (6) It just happened that there were no motorcycle escorts on either side of the limousine to shield the president. (7) It just happened that not one of the agents reacted to shield the president after the first shot rang out. (Clint Hill reacted to protect Jacqueline Kennedy.) (8) It just happened that reports and evidence of two different plots to kill the president were not transmitted to the Dallas field office by the Secret Service even though that information was transmitted to other field offices. (9) It just happened that the limousine slowed down to almost a complete halt in the perfect position for the shot from the grassy knoll and remained there until the fatal shot, while Secret Service agent Greer watched the back of the president’s head get blown out. Only then did the limousine speed up. On its face, without a statistical calculation, it is ridiculously improbable that all of this is coincidental. The involvement of the Secret Service in the assassination is a central piece of the puzzle. It continues to remain a murky area. But even so, the evidence concerning the Secret Service supports the conclusion of a conspiracy involving persons in the federal government planning the assassination before the fact . Indeed, it makes sense that the first thought of any conspiratorial group would be to neutralize the protection of the president. In the Kennedy case, the evidence shows a complex plan involving a sophisticated group who hired professional assassins. If we could discover who it was that compromised the Secret Service and who was giving them their orders, many other pieces of the puzzle would quite probably fall into place. One clue is that Chief Rowley, according to Vincent Palamara, was a good friend of J. Edgar Hoover, who was his former boss. [630] [631] It is perhaps not coincidental that other key suspects in the assassination"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"were former FBI employees—namely William Harvey and Guy Banister. As asked previously, could Harvey have been an FBI mole in the CIA? Could Guy Banister still have been working for Hoover under cover in his private detective agency in New Orleans? There has been much speculation on the subject of J. Edgar Hoover’s using infiltration agents in other government departments and private groups. After all, Hoover had a pathological need to know everything and control everything, as shall now be discussed. "},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"What is most disturbing to me is that two agencies of the government—the CIA and FBI—that were supposed to be loyal and faithful to us, deliberately misled us. Warren Commission Counsel Judge Burton Griffin in 1977 30 J. EDGAR HOOVER William W. Turner, former ten-year FBI man, wrote: The assassination of President Kennedy brought out the Hoover-Johnson team at its precision best. As Congress cranked up to investigate the momentous crime, Johnson took over with the announcement that he was forming his own blue-ribbon commission of inquiry and had asked the FBI to investigate. Less than three weeks after the assassination, far too little time to cover all the ground, Hoover handed the president a confidential summary report that concluded there was not a conspiracy. Simultaneously...he leaked the report’s contents to the press. Thus was the public inculcated with the “no conspiracy” theory, and the Warren Commission was handed it as a fait accompli. [632] Members of the Warren Commission were very upset about this. They had been placed in a position of having to proceed against the nation’s most prestigious and feared law-enforcement organization, in public, if they were to disagree with Hoover’s “findings.” Even after Hoover’s death in 1972, the stonewalling by the FBI and the Department of Justice continued. After completing its inquiry report in 1978, the HSCA recommended that the Justice Department should continue the investigation. It refused. All the Justice Department did was hire consultants to attempt to undermine the acoustical evidence developed in the investigation whereby the HSCA had concluded there were at least two gunmen. The Justice Department did nothing more except, a few years later (about 1984), write an unsigned and undated letter to the House of Representatives submitting the results of its rebuttal to the acoustical evidence and declaring the case closed because there was no evidence of a conspiracy (contrary to the conclusions of the HSCA). As recently as 1992, the Justice Department continued to stonewall, issuing an eight-page, single-spaced letter to the House of Representatives citing executive privilege as the basis for not opening all the Kennedy assassination files to the public. As noted earlier, it is now known with certainty that Hoover’s FBI knew about the Joseph Milteer tape predicting Kennedy’s murder [633] and failed to inform Kennedy that there were two very serious plans underway to assassinate him. Hoover did inform the Secret Service, which bureaucratically was his duty. But then the Secret Service failed to inform Kennedy, and also failed to inform its Dallas office of the threats. After the assassination, the FBI did not pass along the information about Milteer to the Warren Commission until two weeks before its work was to be concluded, when as a practical matter it was too late to be used effectively and still meet the deadline for getting the finished report to Lyndon Johnson. [634] Even more damning against Hoover is the fact that the FBI did nothing to pursue the Milteer matter after the assassination except to interview him on November 27, 1963, whereupon he denied involvement. This interview had the effect of tipping off Milteer that Somersett was informing on him, thus destroying Somersett’s ability to get additional information from Milteer. [635] What the FBI should have done, of course, was to have Somersett wired and once again engage Milteer to record what else could be obtained from him."},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"Adding to this, the FBI never told the Commission that it had received another message concerning a threat against Kennedy told to another of its informants, José Aleman, by Santo Trafficante in a private conversation that took place sometime in September 1962. Aleman stated that Trafficante told him President Kennedy was “going to be hit.” This information was not passed on by Hoover’s FBI to either President Kennedy or the Secret Service before the assassination and, later, the Warren Commission was not informed at all. [636] This explosive evidence, tying the assassination directly to a Mafioso chieftain in Miami, was kept secret by Hoover. In fact, J. Edgar Hoover systematically kept from the Warren Commission any significant information or evidence whatsoever that the Mafia could have been involved in the assassination conspiracy. This evidence was concealed despite the fact that Hoover and the FBI clearly knew there were major connections between Carlos Marcello, David Ferrie, Lee Harvey Oswald, and the assassination. For example, the FBI failed to inform the Warren Commission that FBI informant Eugene De Lapara had told the FBI about Marcello associate Ben Tregle’s foreknowledge of the assassination (Tregle had stated that “there is a price on the president’s head and other members of the Kennedy family. Someone will kill Kennedy when he comes to the south”), even though FBI reports showed that De Lapara had furnished reliable information to the FBI in the past. [637] Within five days after the assassination there was a team of FBI agents in New Orleans that uncovered all of the foregoing evidence of a Mafia connection in a conspiracy to assassinate the president; this team was in a position to crack the case wide open if it had only pursued the evidence. Then, suddenly, on December 18, 1963, all FBI investigations ceased. No mention of David Ferrie or Carlos Marcello was made to the Warren Commission in its supplemental report of January 13, 1964. [638] Another egregious example of proof that Hoover’s FBI engaged in suppression of potentially important evidence involves information received from FBI informant Gene Sumner. Sumner was a respected FBI informant who later became mayor of Darien, Georgia. On November 26, 1963, only four days after the assassination, Sumner informed the FBI that in March or April 1963 he saw someone resembling Lee Harvey Oswald accepting a payment from Joseph Poretto, the owner of the Town and Country Restaurant in New Orleans. The Town and Country Restaurant was a known hangout for hoodlums and was owned in part by Carlos Marcello and managed by Poretto, who had a criminal record. When Sumner was shown a photograph of Oswald, he reiterated his original allegation. He asserted that the photograph resembled the individual he saw accepting the payment in New Orleans. The FBI did not inform the Warren Commission of this obviously critical connection of Oswald to Carlos Marcello. This was all documented in a series of teletypes from the FBI’s Savannah and New Orleans offices. What we have here is a star witness, Gene Sumner, who may have seen the accused murderer of the president receiving money from the mob, yet the FBI failed to inform the Warren Commission about this significant transaction! The FBI had this evidence in its possession and did not act on it, or even reveal it. [639] Added to these major items of evidence are Hoover’s even more incriminating actions relevant to the assassination that have been discussed and documented throughout this book: The FBI was in possession of the Zapruder film and the Nix film when they were altered. This occurred within a few days after the assassination. It follows inescapably that the FBI altered these films themselves or cooperated with others to have it done. Newly released photographs from the National Archives clearly and convincingly add final proof that the FBI knowingly received and concealed evidence in the form of photographs and documents"},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"showing only two empty shell casings on the sixth floor of the School Book Depository Building, and that they then provided the Warren Commission with falsified documents showing three empty shell casings. The FBI cooperated with the Dallas police in falsely pinning the murder of officer J. D. Tippit solely on Oswald, when ballistic and testimonial evidence showed overwhelmingly that at least two people and two guns were involved. J. Edgar Hoover knew very soon after the assassination that separate shots had hit John Connally and Kennedy, therefore there had to be a conspiracy. Hoover’s knowledge of this fact was revealed in tapes of a conversation between Hoover and Lyndon Johnson on November 29, 1963. Hoover did not inform the Warren Commission of his knowledge. The FBI cooperated with the CIA to suppress evidence of an Oswald impersonator in Mexico City, although tapes of a conversation between Hoover and Johnson reveal that Hoover knew there was an Oswald impersonator there. The FBI systematically concealed from the Warren Commission any evidence of value that would implicate right-wing extremist H. L. Hunt in the assassination. On the contrary, the first thing the FBI did was get Hunt out of Dallas to a hotel in Washington, D.C. The Warren Commission Report is virtually devoid of anything on H. L. Hunt because Hoover did not provide them with any of the material leading to Hunt that he had in his possession. Why leave H. L. Hunt out of the investigation? It would seem to be for one reason only: H. L. Hunt was the number-one suspect whose investigation would have exposed the Texas right wing’s involvement in the JFK plot and led to Hoover himself. The FBI concealed the record of John Elrod’s arrest on November 22, 1963, thereby concealing the gun-running operation in Dallas involving John Thomas Masen, militant Cuban exiles, the Minutemen, and Jack Ruby. This evidence would have led directly to H. L. Hunt and General Edwin Walker, friends of J. Edgar Hoover. The FBI did not reveal information in its possession shortly after the assassination about the French OAS terrorist Jean Souetre being in the Dallas-Fort Worth area on November 22, 1963, until forced to do so after notification from French intelligence. On November 22, 1963, the FBI had in its possession numerous documents that would have provided the basis for the indictment of Gerry Patrick Hemming and his Interpen crew for the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Hemming himself admits this. The FBI suppressed these documents and the evidence, or information, was never presented to the Warren Commission. If this information had been made available, it would have revealed meetings between the Dallas right wing and Hemming’s Interpen associates, and Hemming. It would have led directly to General Edwin Walker and H.L. Hunt, and other Texas oil men. Based on investigations by the Justice Department after Hoover’s death, Hoover had received financial favors from organized crime in the form of racetrack tips, information on fixed races, and hundreds of thousands of dollars of free rent for his annual vacations in La Jolla, through Clint Murchison, partner of organized crime in business ventures. Hoover also had received “safe” oil deals [640] through Clint Murchison. *** Of all the major participants in the assassination, Hoover stands out singularly as one person lacking redeeming human qualities. Lyndon Johnson had redeeming human qualities, even the mobsters had likable qualities, but not J. Edgar Hoover. I searched the literature and found nothing good about his character except that he was devoted to his mother and Clyde Tolson and loved his dog. If there was something likable about him I haven’t found it. Even setting aside the Kennedy assassinations and the Martin Luther King assassination, the judgment of history is complete and irrefutable: Hoover was"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"thoroughly despicable; he was a tyrant, a sadist, and a criminal. He was capable of anything. Hoover was sixty-nine years old at the time of John Kennedy’s assassination. He died of “a hypertensive condition” on May 2, 1972 at the age of seventy-seven, nine years after the assassination. [641] He died in his bed at home in an upper-class neighborhood in Washington. Hoover had been head of the FBI for forty-six years—the only director since its inception. No president had been able to remove him. Hoover never married. He lived with his mother until her death, at which time he was forty-six years of age. Except on rare occasions, he did not date a member of the opposite sex. Many people in Washington, D.C., believed that Hoover was a closet homosexual. This, if true, would leave him even more subject to blackmail and to a total loss of power if his secret were revealed to the general public. Rumors were so prevalent and consistent that it became widely accepted as fact. One basis for this suspicion was that he and his assistant director, Clyde Tolson, were inseparable intimates who saw each other seven days a week and took month long vacations together in La Jolla every year, where they shared a bungalow. When in Washington, they dined together every Sunday night at Hoover’s home and every Monday night at Tolson’s apartment. In 1993, when a major story on PBS television Frontline was aired, these rumors took on a reality supported by witnesses. The television program was based on the book Official and Confidential by Anthony Summers. Summers spent five years writing the book and interviewed over 850 people. The revelations were sensational: Summers interviewed witnesses who personally observed Hoover in homosexual encounters with young men; witnesses who observed Hoover dressed as a woman; and a witness who had seen a photograph that was in the possession of the Mafia and the CIA showing Hoover in a homosexual act. [642] Cartha DeLoach, a retired FBI official and one of Hoover’s principal agents involved in wiretapping and spreading of salacious material on Martin Luther King, Jr., appeared on Larry King Live on February 12, 1993 in a face-off with Anthony Summers. As might be expected, DeLoach called Summers’ book slime and garbage and vigorously defended Hoover’s sexual status. But the evidence is extremely convincing that Hoover was, in fact, a homosexual. I had been somewhat reluctant to believe this, having been advised by one of my psychoanalyst consultants that Hoover could have been just an example of sexual repression, and that his relationship with Clyde Tolson could have been asexual. However, in my discussions with people who should know, I could not find one person who did not take it for granted that Hoover was a homosexual. But even if Hoover were not a homosexual and transvestite, it can be said without fear of exaggeration that he was pathologically preoccupied with the subject of sex. In his basement den he had nude pornographic paintings of Eleanor Roosevelt that were genitally explicit which he showed male friends and politicians when they visited his home. [643] In his back yard, walled in with a ten-foot-high fence, were nude statues of young men. When Hoover wanted to get something on his enemies, he almost invariably looked for a sex angle. The irrevocable harm he did to people, illegally using U.S. government funds and exploiting his agents, bears telling in some detail because it reveals the depths of his depravity. Let’s begin with what he did to Martin Luther King, Jr., and his wife, Coretta: Hoover was a rabid racist and for years sought to discredit King. Hoover and the FBI had taped bedroom activities involving King and a variety of women. Hoover sought to have this information leaked through various newspapers and magazines, but no one would touch it. When it was officially announced that King had been given the Nobel Peace Prize, Hoover became enraged and the bureau went into serious action. He sent transcriptions of the King tapes to the White House in the form of a thirteen-page printed booklet which ended up going to various department heads, including the secretary of state. Then the idea emerged in the FBI to send this material directly to Mrs. King. An anonymous letter was composed and a package was"},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"delivered to King’s office in Atlanta at a time when they knew he would be away and the package would be opened by Mrs. King. The package included the most salacious portions of the tapes. The accompanying letter, sent sometime in mid November 1964, was composed in an effort, however ridiculous, to get Mr. King to commit suicide. This is what the letter said, with the sexual contents deleted: King, look into your heart. You know you are a complete fraud and a greater liability to all of us Negroes... You are no clergyman and you know it. I repeat you are a colossal fraud and an evil, vicious one at that....But you are done. Your “honorary” degrees, your Nobel Prize (what a grim farce) and other awards will not save you, King, I repeat you are done.... King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is. You have just 34 days in which to do (this exact number has been selected for a specific reason, it has definite practical significance). You are done. There is but one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy, abnormal fraudulent self is bared to the nation. [644] What we see here is the head of the nation’s police force attempting to wreck a man’s marriage or induce him to suicide using intimate material obtained from wiretaps by his federal agents—the workings of a deformed mind. The obsessive hatred that Hoover had for Martin Luther King, Jr., is almost beyond understanding, let alone description. A recent book, Orders to Kill by William F. Pepper, reports an astounding interchange between Hoover and H. L. Hunt that, according to Hunt’s top aide John Curington, took place in 1967 concerning King. Curington revealed to Pepper that a much closer relationship between Hoover and Hunt existed than had heretofore been known—that their relationship went back to the 1950s when they were poker-playing friends who shared right-wing views. In April 1994, Pepper interviewed Curington (recall that it was John Curington whom H. L. Hunt had sent to the Dallas jail to check out the status of Oswald’s protection the night before he was shot by Ruby). During Pepper’s thirteen-hour interview, Curington told him that J. Edgar Hoover had informed H. L. Hunt that the only way to stop King was to “completely silence him”—the “final solution” as Pepper described it. Curington was present at various meetings between the two men when Martin Luther King was discussed. Usually Hoover came to the old man’s hotel room. While the two men shared a dislike for Dr. King, Hoover’s animosity was more passionate and obsessive, more personal. Hoover regularly provided Hunt with a considerable amount of documentation and material to be used as ammunition against Dr. King in the oil baron’s extreme right-wing, daily nationally syndicated Life Line radio broadcasts. King was a favorite and a regular target of Life Line venom, and Hoover provided the poison. Curington recalled one meeting in Chicago between Hunt and Hoover, which to the best of his recollection was held around the time of the American Medical Association national convention in the year that Milford Rouse was elected president (upon checking I learned that that convention was held in June 1967). At that meeting in Hunt’s hotel room, he recalled Hunt telling Hoover that he could finish King by constantly attacking him on his daily radio broadcasts. Hoover replied that it would not work. He said the only way to stop King would be to “completely silence” him. After King’s murder, Hunt acknowledged to Curington that Hoover had won that argument. He also said that the old man had a private telephone that he kept in his desk drawer. The phone was in the name of a dead man, John McKinley. It was on this phone that he would receive and occasionally place phone calls about sensitive matters. Very few people had the McKinley phone number. Hoover was one and he would call only on this phone... [645] (Emphasis added)"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"Pepper continued: ...Other political allies of Hunt, and the beneficiaries of his largess, across the nation, included John Connally in Texas and Senator James Eastland of Mississippi, who headed the right-wing Senate Internal Security Subcommittee. Curington said that all these people received payoffs or unrecorded contributions from Hunt, delivered in a variety of ways. Connally or Eastland, for example, might sell cattle to Hunt, who would vastly overpay them. He said that a Louisiana state official was the conduit for cash payments to Jimmy Hoffa and the Teamsters Union, whose assistance was bought for the purpose of dealing with labor problems at any of the Hunt operations. In one instance, Hoffa actually pulled the union out of a Hunt operation in Muncie, Indiana. The Teamsters connections were often used to beat up or kill people who created problems at any of the Hunt operations. Curington also said that H. L. Hunt’s daily liaison with President Lyndon Johnson on political matters was former FBI agent Booth Mooney, who was personally close to the president. Mooney not only delivered communications back and forth between Johnson and Hunt but also wrote over half of the Life Line broadcast tracts, including many of those attacking Dr. King. [646] Emphasis added) I have avoided getting into the Martin Luther King, Jr., assassination in this book except briefly where I felt compelled to bring certain aspects into the context of the JFK assassination. I have not been a student of the King assassination, [647] but the evidence of Hoover’s involvement is very compelling. Pepper, a barrister from England, has long been an attorney for James Earl Ray and spent many years researching and writing his book. Pepper’s book presents convincing evidence and documentation that the King assassination was a joint effort of the FBI and Army intelligence with cooperation from the Memphis police. It presents a frightening picture of the extensive use of Army intelligence throughout the United States, in that period of history, for surveillance of U.S. citizens suspected of being “subversives.” As Pepper describes the King assassination, I see it as almost a mirror image of the JFK assassination—that is, a patsy (James Earl Ray), a planted rifle, military intelligence involvement, and the Mafia in the form of Carlos Marcello in New Orleans."},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":" FBI Chief Hoover (right) and his aide, Clyde Tolson (left), in 1942.

Photo Source: UPI/Corbis-Bettmann"},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"An important aspect of Pepper’s interview with John Curington is the close relationship between H. L. Hunt and Hoover that Curington revealed. Let us pause again to reflect on the powerful trio of J. Edgar Hoover, Lyndon B. Johnson, and H. L. Hunt, all of whom had ample motives to want John Kennedy dead. What’s more, they had the power and the money [648] to make it happen and cover it up. Just think of H. L. Hunt’s organization, which included retired Army intelligence General Charles Willoughby (another man “capable of anything”) and his worldwide right-wing anti-Communist apparatus. Think of Hunt’s own paramilitary groups and his connections to the Minutemen and their splinter groups of even more extreme persuasion. Think of H. L. Hunt’s control of the city of Dallas and his linkages with organized crime in Dallas and elsewhere. Then think of J. Edgar Hoover and his secret files and his having been compromised by organized crime, and Hoover’s vast organization of agents, wire-tappers, expert snipers, crime laboratories, and photographic laboratories. Think of Lyndon Johnson, who would become president upon Kennedy’s assassination, and who had the power and political cunning to manipulate Congress, the Supreme Court, the Executive Branch, and the military. Think of Lyndon Johnson’s documented history of utter ruthlessness to seize power using any means necessary—legal or illegal. Has any other such combination of political and financial power and evil ever existed in three people in U.S. history? And all three of these men hated John F. Kennedy, were pathologically extreme personalities, were driven by obsessive needs for power, and wanted Kennedy gone. Getting back to Hoover’s obsession with protecting his image, we have another example that occurred when he learned that a magazine publisher was considering an exposé of the FBI and Hoover. Hoover obtained and selectively distributed compromising photographs showing the publisher’s wife engaged in fellatio with her black chauffeur while parked in Washington’s Rock Creek Park. The identity of the woman was very clear and her name could be identified through the car’s distinctive license plates. The publisher quickly capitulated and sent his personal representative to the FBI to beg Hoover, through Hoover’s representative, Louis Nichols (head of the bureau’s publicity division), to back off. The photos were never published and the article was never written. But never again was there any criticism in the publisher’s magazine concerning Hoover or the FBI. [649] Hoover’s hatred of Eleanor Roosevelt undoubtedly came in part from her having accused him of creating an American gestapo after she learned that the FBI was investigating some of her personal aides: “This type of investigation seems to me to smack too much of the Gestapo methods,” she wrote to Hoover. [650] Unfortunately, this episode did not remain confidential, and the bureau chief was humiliated by the stories being bandied about the capital. Once Franklin Roosevelt was dead, Hoover went to work on attacking his new “enemy,” Eleanor, by leaking outlandish stories about her alleged love affairs with various men and women. Hoover’s use of scurrilous material and lies to smear anyone who crossed him continued unabated. Another victim was Representative Cornelius E. Gallagher, Democrat from New Jersey. In April 1972, Congressman Gallagher gave the following speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives: Mr. Speaker, this is corruption at its worst and its central figure is J. Edgar Hoover. It is he whose unchecked reign of absolute power has intimidated this Congress to the extent that a serious question has not been asked about his management of the FBI for 10 years—maybe longer. He has become the American Beria, destroying those who threaten his empire, frightening those who should question his authority, and terrorizing those who dissent from his ancient and anachronistic view of the world. [651] This speech relates back to an episode some years earlier when Congressman Gallagher was pushing"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"for an investigation in Congress of illegal wiretapping and invasion of privacy by the FBI’s computer technology. Hoover, knowing the congressman’s interest in this matter, had maneuvered to involve him in bureaucratic infighting that would embarrass former Attorney General Robert Kennedy, who had authorized the installation of FBI wiretaps. But Gallagher declined to get involved. Roy Cohn, Hoover’s lackey, told Gallagher, “Mr. Hoover wants to give you a big buildup.... If you’re a friend, anything you need you get. But if you’re not a friend, and you don’t cooperate, that means you’re an enemy.” [652] After Gallagher refused to cooperate, his life was never the same. In 1967 a mysterious burglary at Gallagher’s house involved theft only of documents; police told the congressman it was “an FBI job.” [653] In August 1968 Hoover planted a story with Life magazine that Gallagher had connections with organized crime. Hoover then leaked a story around town that a minor mob figure had died of a seizure while making love to the congressman’s wife. Gallagher went on the attack and threatened Hoover with a speech he planned to make on the congressional floor which he previewed to Cohn: “It has been called to my attention that the Director of the FBI and the Deputy Director of the FBI have been living as man and wife for some 28 years at the public’s expense; as a member of Congress we have an oversight duty and that oversight is to make sure that the funds which go to the FBI are properly spent....” [654] The threat of attack apparently worked, because the scurrilous material was never published and the spreading of the rumor about Gallagher’s wife stopped. The congressman never carried out his threat to make the speech, but the rumors about his wife were never fully cleared. But before Hoover was through, Gallagher was obliged to plead guilty to one count of tax evasion and was sentenced to two years in jail. Hoover’s FBI had destroyed the congressman’s credibility and his political future even before he rose to give the speech which accused Hoover of being the American Beria. In 1986, when Roy Cohn was dying of complications from AIDS, he signed a statement which affirmed that Gallagher’s statements concerning the entire slander episode were truthful. [655] Another episode occurred following the Kennedy assassination when a certain writer was becoming famous for his book which criticized the findings of the Warren Commission. At the time, Hoover was investigating authors of several books that were critical of the Warren Commission Report. Hoover obtained photographs of this author with some prostitutes in an apparent sado-masochistic session in which one of the prostitutes was sticking pins into the head of the author’s erect penis. This material was sent to Lyndon Johnson and several Warren Commission members who jokingly thereafter referred to the author as “Pinhead.” [656] (This story was recently confirmed to me by a Washington, D.C., lawyer who had seen the photograph.) As noted earlier, Hoover’s destruction of anyone who crossed him, or anyone whom he perceived as a political enemy, extended beyond the sex realm into the “Communist smear,” which reached its zenith during the reign of Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon. Hoover was the source of McCarthy’s material, which McCarthy waved in front of TV cameras, smearing anyone he could identify as being a pro- Communist or Communist sympathizer, irrespective of the facts and the truth; and Hoover provided Nixon with his Communist smear material which eventually catapulted him to the presidency. Only recently I came across information that Hoover also supplied similar hate and fear material to H. L. Hunt and General Charles Willoughby. Hunt and Willoughby fed McCarthy with similar material. This paranoid flame, fanned by Hoover, McCarthy, Nixon, H. L. Hunt, and Willoughby, was still alive in 1963 when John Kennedy was assassinated. [657] Hoover looked upon Kennedy as a soft-headed liberal dilettante who was selling out to the"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"Communists and who was an adulterer and a playboy. Kennedy thus came under the double-headed attack of being soft on communism and having loose morals. Ironically, Hoover was a crusader against adultery and homosexuality. The extent of Hoover’s abuse of his power and position—his illegal use of public funds for his personal life and his use of the public treasury to blackmail major public figures in the United States—is so extensive and so widely documented that it would take hundreds of pages to cover it in its hideous detail. He even investigated the sex life of actor Rock Hudson when there was no reason at all to believe that Rock Hudson was a menace to this country. (This was part of an amazing, bizarre directive by Hoover for the [658] FBI to identify every single homosexual in the United States!) Hoover’s secret files on government officials, celebrities, and powerful people were widely known to exist among knowledgeable circles in Washington, many from having been subjected to the brunt of them. His files on the personal matters of powerful people were sequestered in one of his eight offices in his personal suite in the FBI building. The story of the files after Hoover’s death is fascinating. When Hoover died, a shock wave went through the FBI and Washington concerning the secret files. [659] To the present day, it is not known what happened to them. Hoover’s secretary of thirty-six years, Helen Gandy, claims she destroyed only those files that were related to his personal business and personal matters and then turned all other files over to Attorney General Edward Levi. Three years later, after hearing that the official/confidential files still existed and that Attorney General Levi had possession of them, William Sullivan—one of Hoover’s right-hand men in the FBI— told writer David Wise: “Yeah, but he didn’t locate the gold.” John Mohr [another top FBI official] had removed the real gold, Sullivan maintained, which consisted of some “very mysterious files...documents that were in Hoover’s office, very sensitive and explosive files, containing political information, derogatory information on key figures in the country.” Presumably Sullivan was referring to Hoover’s Personal File, though he told a House investigator that trying to understand the difference between the various files, was a “bucket of worms.” [660] There has been considerable research and investigation into the number of files involved and what eventually happened to them. Indications are that up to thirty-five file cabinets were trucked to Hoover’s home from the FBI headquarters in the weeks after Hoover’s death for disposal by Helen Gandy. There is also reason to believe that the most secret files were removed from Hoover’s home in Washington, D.C., and taken to the Blue Ridge Club near Harper’s Ferry, West Virginia, where John Mohr, an FBI official, and his cronies held poker parties. When Senate investigators decided to inspect the club, it burned down the night before their scheduled visit. The fire was blamed by arson investigators on a nine-year-old boy. But in the months after Hoover’s death, “neighbors had noticed various people loading boxes into vehicles in the alley behind the Hoover/Tolson residence. One they identified as James Crawford [an FBI employee], another as John Mohr. One neighbor recalled a third person, who he said bore a striking resemblance to James Angleton....Angleton occasionally played poker with Mohr and his group at the Blue Ridge Club.” [661] Mohr denied under oath that he took any of the files from Hoover’s 30th Street residence, but he made one exception. He did state that he had removed “several boxes of spoiled wine.” When Angleton was questioned on this subject by Curt Gentry in a 1978 telephone interview, he would neither confirm nor deny having picked up any of the files. When asked if, as rumored, Hoover’s derogatory files on William “Wild Bill” Donovan had been exchanged for the CIA’s investigative files on J. Edgar Hoover’s alleged homosexuality,"},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"Angleton laughed and said, “First, you have to find out if they’re missing.” It was an interesting clue, if Angleton meant it as that, because most of Hoover’s files on Donovan are missing. Only a few hundred pages remain of what must have been thousands, and they do not include most of the derogatory material that aides say Hoover amassed on his longtime nemesis. “I’ll tell you one thing,” Angleton added with a chuckle, “and this is the last thing I’ll tell you. I didn’t haul away any spoiled wine.” [662] (Emphasis added) Some believe that Hoover’s most secret files still exist somewhere and are being used as tools of power. William Sullivan, Hoover’s assistant director, gave an example when he implied that the files on Senator Sam Ervin kept him from inquiring too deeply into the FBI’s role during the Watergate hearings. [663] The evidence is overwhelming that J. Edgar Hoover illegally participated in a massive effort to pin the crime of President Kennedy’s assassination on a lone assassin and to conceal the involvement of the Mafia and the Dallas police in the conspiracy. From what we see, should we seriously consider that Hoover did all of this out of personal quirks and that he was not part of the master conspiracy? It is true beyond a reasonable doubt that Hoover was an accessory to the crime of assassinating the president of the United States, before and after the fact, and should have been sent to prison. He knew the assassination was going to happen and did nothing to stop it. He knew that there was a conspiracy and did everything in his power to conceal it, including tampering with and destruction of evidence. Why should we not also conclude that Hoover was part of the plot? Does not a thorough study of Hoover’s psychopathic, evil character, and his history of deliberate, extreme, self-serving and ruthless actions, and his motive of survival (both political and personal), make it logical that he would have been an active agent in the plot? Put another way, would it not be the height of simple-minded naiveté to believe otherwise? Hoover hated Robert Kennedy, had utter disrespect for John Kennedy, and was on his way out of his cherished position as director of the FBI and knew it. A reasonable question arises: Although Hoover had considerable evidence of John Kennedy’s womanizing, would he ever have been able to use it? Once Kennedy was reelected in 1964, Hoover faced the very likely prospect of being dismissed before the end of Kennedy’s second term. Robert Kennedy would have seen to that. Both Robert and John had put up with Hoover long enough. They undoubtedly knew of Hoover’s homosexuality and knew that they had this over his head, and that it would keep Hoover’s mouth shut about Kennedy’s womanizing. Hoover therefore had powerful personal motivations to see Kennedy gone. It seems very plausible, even inescapable, that Hoover realized that if he were removed as the head of the FBI he would lose his power to conceal his own personal secrets and would be finished. His reputation would be irreparably shattered. Hoover also knew that the financial favors he had received from the Mafia over the years would ultimately be exposed if Robert Kennedy were left to his maniacal drive to put Jimmy Hoffa and Mafia chieftains in prison. Also, perhaps most critical of all, the plotters logically would not have proceeded with the assassination of the president of the United States had they not been confident that Hoover’s response would be thoroughly protective of their role as perpetrators. The plotters did not have to take that risk. And, as is apparent in analysis of Hoover’s actions, his response was indeed quick and decisive: within twenty-four hours, he had pinned the crime on Oswald and forthwith was on his way to shut down the investigation when he knew, as his taped conversations with Lyndon Johnson reveal, that separate shots struck Connally and Kennedy and therefore there had to have been a conspiracy. Why on earth would the Mafia not have brought Hoover into the plot? They had him fully compromised, if for no other reason than the free bungalow in La Jolla used by Hoover and Tolson over the years, and the race track fixes that Frank Costello had arranged for Hoover. Of this there is no question. And it is very compelling to me that Anthony Summers is right about Hoover, that the Mafia and"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"the CIA had a photograph of Hoover and Tolson in a homosexual act. Why would they not have had this photograph? Hoover and Tolson stayed in the same bungalow in La Jolla every year; a bungalow provided by Clint Murchison, who was a business partner of Jimmy Hoffa and the Mafia. It would have been a simple matter for the Mafia to get such a photograph. All they had to do was hire a private detective to take care of it for them. The Mafia would have been crazy not to get such a photograph. It was their standard practice to compromise law-enforcement officials and politicians. Think of it: The mob, having an opportunity in their lap for years to totally compromise the chief law-enforcement officer of the United States, and not take advantage of it? I have concluded that the evidence clearly and convincingly shows that Hoover was a part of the plot to murder John F. Kennedy almost from the beginning—a plot designed, of course, with ultimate care to provide Hoover with perfect, plausible deniability. Perhaps he didn’t know the complete details of the plot, but, again, that is an integral part of plausible deniability. At an absolute minimum, I believe that Hoover knew that John Kennedy was going to be assassinated and was aware of the general outline of the plot. It would not surprise me at all to learn someday that Hoover was in the master plan up to his eyeballs, the archfiend behind it. Those who would like to exonerate Hoover from being part of the plot and participating in the cover- up solely to protect his image are, of course, free to do so; but I for one would not bet one dollar on it. We will now proceed to a study of perhaps the most complex and Machiavellian political character in American history: Lyndon Baines Johnson. In this study, we shall consider the possibility that the cover-up in Washington was for legitimate, “national security purposes.” I shall argue that such a notion has no reasonable merit."},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"After years of meeting first-rate minds in and out of universities, I am sure I have never met a more intelligent person than Lyndon Johnson—intelligent in terms of sheer IQ, a clear, swift, penetrating mind, with an abundance of its own type of imagination and subtleties. Eric F. Goldman, The Tragedy of Lyndon Johnson (Special consultant to President Lyndon B. Johnson from December 1963 until September 1966) 31 LYNDON J OHNSON Reasons for suspecting that Lyndon Johnson was part of the conspiracy begin with the fact that Johnson stood to gain the most from the death of President Kennedy. In his self-published manuscript The Case Against Lyndon B. Johnson , the late Joachim Joesten had this to say: Since Roman jurisprudence, two thousand years ago, a basic maxim of criminal investigation has been CUI BONO? Who gains? Who stands to benefit from the crime? That question has not been asked by the Dallas police. It has not been asked by District Attorney Wade. It has not been asked by the FBI. It is not being asked by the Warren Commission, for all one knows at this time. [664] Joesten went on to say that never bothering to ask that all-important question alone stamped the Warren Commission’s seemingly painstaking investigation as a fraud. He said that the touchstone of honest intent in any inquest is first to ask the question: Who had the most to gain? Find the person who stands to benefit the most from any given crime and you have found the most likely suspect. I would put it another way: Find the person who stands to lose everything if the crime is not committed and you have found the most likely suspect. Now, of course, cui bono? is not enough by itself to establish guilt. But in the case of Lyndon Johnson there is much more. First, we must take into account that Johnson was deeply involved in the planning and knew the details of Kennedy’s trip to Dallas. Second, as noted earlier, Johnson’s long-time relationship with H. L. Hunt and J. Edgar Hoover formed the most powerful and ruthless combination in U.S. history. All three wanted Kennedy removed from office. Add to this the fact that Johnson was in a position—through his connections with the Secret Service, Texas Governor John Connally, and officials in Dallas—to control the parade route that took the motorcade slowly past the Texas School Book Depository Building into a perfect setting for assassination by crossfire. This was simply a matter of insuring that the site for the luncheon speech was the Trade Mart, which provided an excuse for the motorcade to go down Elm Street into an ideal crossfire setting, passing by Oswald’s workplace. Through H. L. Hunt and powerful right- wing Democrats in Dallas and with a little help from the Secret Service, the arrangements could have been made. In fact, we might ask, “How else?” Also, of no small consequence, Johnson despised Kennedy and apart from that had a personal obsession, bordering on the pathological, to become president of the United States. [665] In criminal investigations, if a person actively attempts to cover up a crime and is a prime suspect in terms of motive, means, and opportunity, it is considered tantamount to proof of guilt. Since Johnson had the motive and, above all others, the means and opportunity, it follows that the first place to look is the evidence concerning his cover-up actions immediately after Kennedy was assassinated. In so doing, we can keep in mind that Johnson did not have Hoover’s reason to cover up. Unlike Hoover, no one would have blamed Johnson’s incompetence for the president’s death."},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"Lyndon Johnson’s Role in the Cover-Up Within twelve hours after Kennedy’s murder, all available evidence at the crime scene pertaining to the case—including the murder weapon, Kennedy’s clothing, a blood-stained and bullet-punctured limousine, the magic bullet, and the Zapruder film—were seized and either sent to Washington or placed under the complete control of the Secret Service and the FBI. Within seventy-two hours, the limousine was shipped to Cincinnati where it was completely re-built—clearly a destruction of material evidence. This was all done through someone who had the power to issue sweeping orders and to have them obeyed without question. Records show that Lyndon Johnson’s aide, Cliff Carter, was giving such orders, and that when people refused to obey them Johnson would make personal telephone calls with follow-up demands. This type of commandeering of evidence was a violation of the laws of Texas and was a federal crime. By federal and state law, JFK’s autopsy should have been performed in Dallas, and the case should have been prosecuted and tried in the state of Texas. (Incredibly, in 1963 it was not a federal crime to assassinate the president of the United States.) The unprecedented seizure of evidence could perhaps be benignly explained by Lyndon Johnson’s deep suspicion that the conspiracy originated in Texas and therefore he had to seize all the evidence to get it out of the hands of the culprits. But a more sinister and believable explanation is that the evidence was seized so that it could be totally under the control of Lyndon Johnson and he could be certain that there would not be a real investigation. A good example of how the case was influenced involves Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade, who would have been in charge of the investigation and prosecution in Dallas had he not been stopped on the orders of Lyndon Johnson. On November 23, 1963 the Dallas Morning News carried a story quoting Wade as saying that preliminary reports indicated more than one person was involved in the shooting. “This is the most dastardly act I’ve ever heard about,” Wade said. “Everyone who participated in this crime—any-one who helped plan it or furnished a weapon, knowing the purpose for which it was intended—is guilty of murder under Texas law. They should all go to the electric chair.” [666] But Wade’s story changed after he received a telephone call from Johnson’s aide, Cliff Carter. Years later Wade recalled why: Cliff Carter, President Johnson’s aide, called me three times from the White House that Friday night. He said that President Johnson felt any word of a conspiracy—some plot by foreign nations— to kill President Kennedy would shake our nation to its foundation. President Johnson was worried about some conspiracy on the part of the Russians. Oswald had all sorts of connections and affections toward Castro’s Cuba. It might be possible to prove a conspiracy with Cuba. But it would be very hard to prove a conspiracy with Russia. Washington’s word to me was that it would hurt foreign relations if I alleged a conspiracy—whether I could prove it or not. I would just charge Oswald with plain murder and go for the death penalty. So, I went down to the Police Department at City Hall to see Captain Fritz—to make sure the Dallas police didn’t involve any foreign country in the assassination. [667] Gary Shaw wrote about a personal call made by Johnson to the Dallas police to shut down the investigation: The day after the Zapruder film of the assassination had been shown on national television for the first time (March 1975), retired police captain Will Fritz and a small circle of old political cronies and businessmen were conversing over lunch when the discussion turned to the TV presentation of"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"the Zapruder film and the renewed interest in the JFK murder. Fritz began to reminisce about his role in the events of that terrible weekend. Fritz told his friends that as Chief of the Homicide Division, he had been steadily and thoroughly investigating the President’s murder, despite interference and opposition from Federal authorities; he received several phone calls between Lee Oswald’s Friday afternoon arrest and Saturday afternoon, November 23, urging him to cease the investigation because, “You have your man.” The captain though, continued to conduct the investigation until late Saturday, when he received a person-to-person telephone call from the new President. As Fritz put it to his circle of friends, “But when the President of the United States called me and ordered the investigation stopped, what could I do?” [668] (Emphasis added) Gary Shaw noted that more research should be done to confirm the above. I wrote to Mary Ferrell and asked for her help. She responded by giving me two names of retired Dallas police officers to call. One was Frank B. Harrell and the other was Jim Leavelle. I called Harrell first. He was very cooperative. He remembered the lunch and confirmed that Captain Fritz had told that story, that Lyndon Johnson had called and ordered Captain Fritz to pull off questioning Oswald. Harrell said that if Captain Fritz had been allowed to keep Oswald, “he would have gotten that information”—that Captain Fritz was “a master of interrogation.” Harrell said that Fritz was “pulled off because he was getting too close.” He said that in “a couple of more hours he’d have broken Oswald, but they pulled Oswald out.” [669] Next I called Jim Leavelle. He said that he didn’t remember being at that lunch, but that he had attended luncheons with Fritz and other officers and that subject hadn’t come up. Leavelle then added: Now I did ask him one time—I say think I asked him—he was not one to volunteer a lot of information. So he doesn’t sit around and volunteer that. So I asked him one time, I can’t remember just about how I put it to him, just he and I were sitting in the office one day talking about something else and this came up. And I asked him if Hoover called him, I believe. And I kind of intimated that whether anybody else had called him in that connection and he just kind of shook his head and he said, “Well, I did talk to Hoover.” He never indicated to me for sure that—he didn’t tell me outright —that the president had called him. But I feel like that he did, but I have no way of proving that; I don’t have any personal knowledge that he did. The only thing I asked him was if he’d talked to Hoover. Of course he had talked to Hoover before. They were...well, while they weren’t friends, they were acquaintances... . [670] Leavelle said that Frank Harrell and Captain Fritz did get together once in awhile, but as to what Fritz may have said to Frank he had no way of knowing. Leavelle remembered that when Chief Curry told Captain Fritz that the FBI was going to take over, “the captain put up quite a bit of argument”; that he “fought furiously about it,” but the chief said, “Cap, this is a direct order. Turn everything over to the Bureau.” Leavelle said he was in the office when that happened. [671] One should take serious note of the foregoing evidence of Johnson, now the President of the United States, directly interfering in the investigation with the clearly expressed purpose of shutting it down—to the point of calling Captain Fritz to halt the interrogation of Oswald. For what reason would Johnson do a thing so dangerous to his remaining in presidential power if this act of cover-up should be discovered? It would surely be an impeachable offense. Its implication as to Johnson’s involvement in the assassination conspiracy scarcely requires explanation. Lyndon Johnson also got directly in the act when he made an astonishing call from Washington, D.C., to Parkland Hospital and asked to talk with one of the doctors working on Oswald after he had been shot. Dr. Charles A. Crenshaw, in his book Conspiracy of Silence, wrote:"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":" ...As I was turning around, a nurse tapped me on the shoulder and asked if I would take a telephone call in the supervisor’s office. She had chosen me to take the call because I was the head of Surgical “B,” the team that began the operation. I agreed to answer the call and left the operating room. When I entered the office, the receiver was lying on the desk. “This is Dr. Crenshaw, may I help you?” “This is President Lyndon B. Johnson,” the voice thundered. “Dr. Crenshaw, how is the accused assassin?” I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. The very first thought that I had was, how did he know when to call? “Mr. President, he’s holding his own at the moment,” I reported. “Would you mind taking a message to the operating surgeon?” he asked in a manner that sounded more like an order. “Dr. Shires is very busy right now, but I will convey your message.” “Dr. Crenshaw, I want a deathbed confession from the accused assassin. There’s a man in the operating room who will take the statement. I will expect full cooperation in this matter,” he said firmly . [672] Crenshaw said, “Yes sir,” and hung up the phone. Oswald died minutes later without saying a word to anybody. Dr. Crenshaw later reflected, “...why would the President of the United States personally call the operating room at Parkland Hospital and ask for a deathbed confession? That question still puzzles me. Why wouldn’t someone with the Dallas police or the FBI make that request? Then, more questions followed, inquiries that had frightening, inconceivable answers.” [673] It is indeed strange that Johnson should be making such a call personally. It seems that he must have been extremely anxious and in a state of desperation about something. An obvious explanation is not that he was genuinely trying to seek a confession from Oswald. After all, he had called the Dallas Police to stop the interrogation of Oswald, obviously to keep him from talking. So are we to believe that now Johnson suddenly wanted Oswald to tell all? It seems more likely that Johnson’s strange telephone call was to create an image of himself as a man who believed in Oswald’s guilt; an image that he, Johnson, believed that Oswald’s dying words would be that he, Oswald, had acted alone. Yet Oswald was unconscious. One would think that Johnson would have known that fact, if, as he said, he had a man there in the room who could have taken a confession. Common sense tells us that Johnson probably knew that there was little possibility of Oswald saying anything to anybody, and made the call to create history favorable to himself. On the other hand, Johnson could have been paranoid, fearful that if Oswald survived, or could say anything, he would provide evidence for a conspiracy, with some details. Perhaps Johnson’s anxiety became unbearable as he pondered the possibility, no matter how slight, that Oswald would regain consciousness and start talking, and Johnson wanted his man there to control the situation, who was privy to the information. So in his inimitable fashion, Johnson grabbed the telephone to call the emergency room at Parkland Hospital. Add to this the fact that Johnson lied to Jacqueline Kennedy when he told her that Robert Kennedy had suggested he take the oath of office in Dallas. Robert Kennedy was surprised when he heard this and said that he had made no such suggestion. Johnson lied again on this subject in his deposition to the Warren Commission when he stated that Robert Kennedy had asked him to take the oath immediately in Dallas. In fact, Robert Kennedy had said nothing of the kind. Johnson had proposed the idea on the telephone to Robert Kennedy, who was taken aback. He neither consented nor dissented to Johnson’s suggestion. He"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"agreed only to call Johnson back to answer his question “Who could swear me in?” [674] Johnson again lied in his Warren Commission affidavit when he said that Ken O’Donnell, Kennedy’s aide, had twice urged him to take the presidential plane back to Washington—because it had better communications equipment. Johnson said that “he consented, with the stipulation that he would wait there until Mrs. Kennedy and President Kennedy’s body were brought aboard the plane.” O’Donnell denied this, telling author William Manchester that he had no conversation regarding Air Force One , and adding that if the Kennedy party had known that Johnson was going on Air Force One they would have taken Air Force Two . O’Donnell declared Johnson’s version to be “absolutely, totally and unequivocally wrong.” He said Air Force Two was an exact duplicate of Air Force One in all respects. [675] Johnson’s insistence on taking the oath in Dallas and delaying the flight back to Washington raises the suspicion that he wanted to take control of Kennedy’s body, which was also placed on Air Force One . Also, by having the photo opportunity of standing beside Jacqueline Kennedy for the swearing-in ceremony, Johnson achieved an initial statement of succession in office that appeared, at least on the surface, to be in harmony with the Kennedy family. At the same time he would have effective control of the Kennedy party. Better to have them in his dominion than in another plane flying back to Washington where they could get their heads together and possibly start asking serious questions. One would think that it would be all-important for Johnson to get back to the White House and assume the complex duties of governing the nation in its time of shock, confusion, and grief. Johnson, however, held up the flight for over an hour and a half until Kennedy’s body was aboard Air Force One and Oswald had been captured; and, not insignificantly, Johnson had been formally sworn in—perhaps to eliminate any possibility of a revolt on the part of the Kennedy camp had they gotten organized and had they had an opportunity to confer with Robert Kennedy back in Washington before a formal swearing-in. There was no need whatsoever for Johnson to delay the flight and subject Jacqueline Kennedy to the agony of his presence in the formal succession. Legally, Johnson became president the instant that Kennedy was shot. Immediately after the assassination, Johnson ordered that the entire investigation be conducted by the FBI under the supervision of J. Edgar Hoover. [676] Furthermore, he ordered all other investigations by federal government or local government to be stopped. This placed Johnson in virtual control of the investigation through J. Edgar Hoover, who detested the Kennedys and had everything to gain by John Kennedy’s death, and everything to lose if Kennedy lived. One of Johnson’s first acts after the assassination was to float the idea of creating a Texas Commission consisting solely of Texans to investigate the assassination. When this created objections, Johnson backed off and formed the Warren Commission, appointing all the members himself under the guidance of J. Edgar Hoover. Johnson told members of Congress that the only purpose would be to “evaluate the report being prepared by J. Edgar Hoover.” [677] Thus, we have the commission investigating the crime but the evidence supplied to them completely under the control of Lyndon Johnson. How unbelievable, when Johnson should have been a prime suspect, by all standards and precedence in criminology. When Kennedy’s body was taken back to Washington [678] and when Jacqueline Kennedy selected Bethesda Naval Hospital for the performance of the autopsy, the Navy doctors who were assigned were not forensic pathologists. The doctor who was placed in charge, Dr. James Humes, had taken only one medical course in forensic pathology. Thus, by having a medical team who knew nothing or next to nothing about conducting autopsies and having this medical team consisting of government employees (military officers) who were under oath to do what they were told by their superiors, Johnson’s control of"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"the autopsy was, he must have thought, assured. When one considers: (1) the fact that the autopsy photographs were not shown to the doctors who performed the autopsy before their report was written; [679] (2) the fact that the autopsy photographs are in obvious contradiction to each other; (3) the fact that the autopsy photographs are in contradiction to the Zapruder films; (4) the evidence that the autopsy x-rays and the Zapruder film were forged; (5) the evidence that the autopsy photographs and x-rays are in total disagreement with the medical witnesses who were present at Parkland Hospital and the enlisted personnel who participated in the autopsy in Bethesda; (6) the evidence that surgery was performed on Kennedy’s head in some mysterious way before the autopsy started, and (7) the fact that the brain vanished, the conclusion seems inescapable to me that no one except the president of the United States, acting in concert with a few high military and government officials, could have caused these things to happen and to dovetail. Lyndon Johnson was no fool. He always had his finger in every pie and his nose in every tent. It defies common sense that all of this could have gone on without his knowing about it. Lyndon Johnson’s Strange and Venal Character In a court of law, evidence to establish proof of other crimes committed by the accused, if in context, or in a conspiracy, is considered admissible if it sheds light on the person’s capability and motive to commit the crime at issue. [680] In the case of Lyndon Johnson, there is an abundance of examples. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert A. Caro told the Atlantic Monthly : For years, men came into Lyndon Johnson’s office and handed him envelopes stuffed with cash. They didn’t stop coming even when the office in which he sat was the office of the Vice President of the United States. Fifty thousand dollars (in hundred-dollar bills in sealed envelopes) was what one lobbyist—for one oil company—testified that he brought to Johnson’s office during his term as Vice President. [681] (Emphasis in original) Jack Halfen, a Dallas gangster who had been involved in criminal exploits with “Pretty Boy” Floyd, Bonnie Parker, and Clyde Barrow, provided incriminating information against Johnson in conversations with U.S. Marshall J. Neal Matthews in 1956. Halfen revealed that his Mafia franchise network had given Johnson $500,000 in cash contributions over a ten-year period while Johnson was in the Senate. For that, Johnson used his considerable influence to kill anti-racket bills and thwart investigations of organized crime. Halfen substantiated his accusations against Johnson with a letter from Johnson to the Texas Board of Parole on Halfen’s behalf, with photographs showing Johnson and Halfen and other Texas politicians on a private hunting trip. [682] There is another sinister series of events that points to the possibility that Lyndon Johnson was capable of participating in a plot to murder. This involved a Texan named Billie Sol Estes, who along with Lyndon Johnson was being implicated in a major scandal— “the most gigantic swindle and scandal in the history of Texas,” as described by Johnson biographer J. Evetts Haley. [683] Among other things, the scandal involved Estes’ acquiring millions in federal cotton allotment payments on land which was under water or was actually owned by the government. Estes was also implicated in a scheme involving fraudulent borrowings on thousands of nonexistent fertilizer tanks—15,000 alleged tanks in one county alone— with chattel mortgages of more than $34 million in the several Texas counties involved, most of"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"which was fictitiously financed with false mortgage papers. The schemes blew sky high when a courageous surgeon, Dr. John Down, conducted an investigation on his own and, with an associate, purchased a newspaper, the Pecos Independent and Enterprise , to expose the scandal in a series of three articles. [684] The articles brought a Pulitzer Prize to Oscar Griffen, the editor of the newspaper. The Estes scandals were being investigated by Henry Marshall, a Department of Agriculture official who was interested in Estes’ connections with Lyndon Johnson. But before any official action could be taken, Marshall was shot dead and found in a remote section of his farm near Franklin, Texas. He had been shot five times in the stomach by a bolt-action, .22 caliber rifle that lay near the body. In what was common Texas justice at the time, a local justice of the peace ruled that Marshall’s death was a suicide— without the benefit of an autopsy. Later, after Marshall’s widow violently protested and after public complaints, Marshall’s body was exhumed. New tests showed that in addition to the five bullets to the stomach, Marshall had also received—before his death—a severe blow to his head and was asphyxiated with carbon monoxide. [685] Estes ultimately went to prison (although he was never charged with the murder of Marshall), and one year after his release from prison testified before a grand jury concerning the death of Marshall. In his testimony. Estes linked Vice President Johnson and two other men to the execution of Henry Marshall. This was reported in an article in the Dallas Times Herald on March 31, 1968 by staff writer William Barnett: Two years ago this month, convicted swindler Billie Sol Estes told a startling tale to a grand jury in rural Robertson County. The legendary con man claimed Lyndon B. Johnson, about to become vice president, had ordered the 1961 murder of U.S. Agriculture Department agent Henry H. Marshall. Estes said the future president was fearful Marshall, of Bryan, could link Johnson aide Clifton Carter—and thus Johnson —to Estes’ fraudulent activities. Testifying with immunity, Estes even named a hit man: Malcolm E. “Mac” Wallace, a former University of Texas at Austin student body president. Wallace had been convicted of murder with malice in the 1951 killing of Austin golf pro J. Doug Kinser. After hearing Estes, the grand jury changed the official cause of the death of Marshall—who had been found with five bullet shots to the side—from suicide to homicide but said there was no one alive to indict.... The article went on to say that, according to former LBJ assistant Horace Busby, the alleged assassin Malcolm Wallace once dated (in 1949 or 1950) LBJ’s younger sister, Josefa Johnson, who was getting a divorce; she had just been released from an alcoholic rehabilitation center and “she may have moved in with him or he moved in with her.” Lyndon Johnson’s biographer, J. Evetts Haley, wrote—without naming sources—that Malcolm Wallace had worked for LBJ before moving into the Department of Agriculture as an “economist.” But back in Austin, Kinser, the thirty-three-year-old golf professional, was going with Lyndon’s sister Josefa. In what was apparently a jealous rage, the thirty-year-old Wallace drove up to the Pitch and Putt golf course where Kinser worked and shot him dead. Wallace fled, was caught, and brought to trial. He was defended by attorney John Cofer, LBJ’s “ever ready and able lawyer in times of trouble.” The jury found Wallace guilty “of murder with malice aforethought” but, incredibly, “after one of the briefest and most perfunctory trials of a prominent murder case on record, even in Texas,” the jury decided on a penalty of only a five-year suspended sentence—for murder in the first degree. [686] According to the Dallas Times Herald article, the prosecuting attorney in the case was also an LBJ ally. The Austin Statesman"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"commented that this case was “marked from the start to finish by the unusual...and had left the people of Austin shocked and quizzical.” [687] The extreme nature of Lyndon Johnson’s obsession for power and his willingness to do anything to achieve it went back to his days at Southwest State Teachers College in San Marcos, Texas. In his meticulously researched book The Years of Lyndon Johnson, Robert A. Caro wrote that “While still an undergraduate...he [Johnson] arranged (through the president of the college) to have excised (literally cut out) from hundreds of copies of the college yearbook certain pages that gave clues to his years there (luckily, other copies escaped the scissors). [688] Issues of the college newspaper that chronicle certain crucial episodes in his college career are missing from the college library. A ruthless use thereafter of political power in San Marcos made faculty members and classmates reluctant to discuss those aspects of his career. And college is merely one example. In a sense, Lyndon Johnson not only attempted to create, and leave for history, his own legend, but to ensure that it could never be disproven.” [689] (Emphasis added) This bizarre image of Johnson as a young man, arranging to have pages cut out of his college yearbook to protect his reputation, strikes one as being highly apropos to what occurred in the Kennedy assassination—extraordinary, fantastic manipulations of people and evidence—all fitting a weird pattern of criminality that Johnson began to exhibit as a young man in college. Another example of Johnson’s pattern of peculiar behavior was described by President Kennedy’s secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, in her book Kennedy and Johnson . Lincoln wrote: Mr. Johnson, on the other hand, started out, from the very beginning, to spend as much time as he possibly could around the White House. There were two doors in my office that opened out on the colonnade that led to the South Lawn. Mr. Johnson chose to enter the West Wing through one of the doors of my office. Nearly every morning he would open that door, grunt and pause for a moment to look around to see what was going on. He would look into the President’s office to see if Mr. Kennedy was there, or pause to talk to people who came in and out of my office. If there was nothing to attract his attention, he would amble over to the other door and go out into the hall.... One morning he was a little late coming through the door and when he arrived Mr. Kennedy was standing near my desk. They exchanged greetings and Mr. Johnson proceeded on his way to the hall. After Mr. Johnson had gone, Mr. Kennedy turned to me and said, “Does he use this door very often?” “Every day,” I replied. “What is he doing in these offices?” Mr. Kennedy asked. I checked and learned that Mr. Johnson’s driver let him out near the sidewalk leading to the President’s office on the South Lawn. He would then walk up that sidewalk past the President’s office to the door of my office. From my office he went out into the hall which led to the reception room. It was in this room that the newspaper men gathered. It was only a short distance from that room to his office in the Executive Office Building across the street. By coming into my office, Mr. Johnson was creating the image of working closely with Mr. Kennedy at all times, especially if he was in the outer office when any of the Cabinet men or other officials came in. Also, when he came out into the reception room from the area of the President’s office the press would obviously get the same impression . [690] With these examples of Johnson’s Machiavellian nature, it becomes easier to believe that his holding Air Force One on the ground in Dallas until his image as president was broadcast to the world, with Jacqueline Kennedy’s tacit consent and approval, was not a spontaneous act, but rather was part of a carefully crafted plan."},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":" Stories of Lyndon Johnson’s viciousness and cruelty prevail among virtually all who knew him. This goes back to his college days at San Marcos, even high school. Episode after episode has been reported. In all instances this cruelty was directed at subordinates who were in Johnson’s thrall; or hapless, powerless victims. What’s more, Johnson was openly proud of his ability to “break” people. [691] He would deliberately set out to destroy a rival, or someone who threatened him, or simply an unfortunate person, just for the fun of it; and nothing would stop him, no act was too gross or inhuman, until he had succeeded in whipping his target into abject submission or humiliation. At the same time, Johnson would indulge in obsequious flattering and attentiveness to those who had power over him or could help him in his pursuit of power and control. Robert Caro describes Johnson’s pattern of ingratiating himself with those in power, attaching himself to them until he could rise above or succeed them. At San Marcos College he became the favorite of the college’s president, Cecil E. Evans, who was LBJ’s protector and promoter in campus politics, while at the same time Johnson was loathed and ridiculed by the student body. His list of mentors grew to include President Franklin D. Roosevelt, [692] who became another admirer and promoter of Johnson. People in power were spared the wrath and cruelty that Johnson heaped with incredible venom on those who were dependent on him for security or emotional needs. "},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"John F. Kennedy and his vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson . Johnson’s jealousy and contempt for John and Robert Kennedy were commonly known in 1963. In private, Johnson frequently referred to JFK as “Sonny Boy.” In the 1960 campaign for the Democratic nomination, Johnson described Kennedy to Peter Lisagor of the Chicago Daily News as a “little scrawny fellow with rickets.” “‘Have you ever seen his ankles?’ Johnson asked. ‘They’re about so round,’ and he traced a minute circle with his finger.” Johnson’s biographer, Doris Kearns Goodwin, wrote that Johnson described Kennedy to her in his latter years at the LBJ Ranch as “weak and pallid,” “a scrawny man with a bad back, a weak and indecisive politician, a nice man, a gentle man, but not a man’s man.” Johnson was offered the vice presidential nomination after he was defeated in his run for the presidency in the Democratic Convention in 1960. After Johnson first feigned reluctance to accept the vice presidential position and the Kennedys had second thoughts, Robert Kennedy tried to withdraw the offer, but LBJ reportedly begged and cried for it until Robert reluctantly gave in after a phone call to John Kennedy. Johnson told friends that “one president in four dies in office. I’m a gambling man.” By the fall of 1963, rumors were rife that Johnson would be dumped from the 1964 Democratic national ticket. In fact, on the day he left for Dallas President Kennedy told his secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, that Johnson would not be the vice president during Kennedy’s second term. Photo Source: UPI/Corbis-Bettmann Robert Caro wrote that Lyndon Johnson was alleged to have stolen the election for his first U.S. Senate seat in 1948, and had stolen his first election in college in 1930. [693] “He won another campus election by the use against a young woman of what his lieutenants called ‘blackmail.’ [694] And a score of political tricks on the same moral level earned him a reputation on campus as a man who was not ‘straight,’ not honest.” [695] Johnson became so deeply and widely mistrusted at college that he was nicknamed “Bull” (for “Bullshit”) Johnson. His fellow students believed not only that he lied to them, but that he “lied so incessantly that he was, in a widely used phrase, ‘the biggest liar on campus’—but also that some psychological element impelled him to lie, made him, in one classmate’s words, ‘a man who"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"just could not tell the truth.’” [696] This same description of Johnson would later be made by John Kennedy, who said that Johnson “just could not tell the truth.” Robert Kennedy confirmed this in an interview with historian Arthur Schlesinger, in which he said that President Kennedy told him on November 21, 1963—the night before the assassination—that Johnson was incapable of telling the truth. Robert Kennedy went on to say, “And my experience with him since then is that he lies all the time. I’m telling you, he just lies continuously, about everything. In every conversation I have with him, he lies. As I’ve said, he lies even when he doesn’t have to.” [697] Caro wrote that “the dark thread was still present after college. It would be present throughout his life....And by 1941, also the major patterns of his entire life are established and clear. In attaining this influence, he has displayed a genius for discerning a path to power, an utter ruthlessness in destroying obstacles in that path, and a seemingly bottomless capacity for deceit, deception and betrayal in moving along it....” [698] The pattern of Johnson’s predilection for corruption would continue into his presidency, as exemplified by the Bobby Baker affair. Baker was Lyndon Johnson’s secretary for eight years until he resigned on October 7, 1963 after grand-scale influence peddling was exposed and it became common knowledge that he was directing the operation of a high-class prostitution ring for the benefit of the politically powerful in Washington, D.C. It was partly because of this scandal that Johnson was expected to be dumped by President Kennedy from the second spot on the 1964 Democratic ticket. Bobby Baker’s corruption resulted in Baker ultimately being sent to prison on seven counts of tax evasion, theft, and fraud involving nearly $100,000 in political payoff money. The illegal transactions involved dealings with mobsters and teamsters in Texas, Nevada, the Caribbean, and Washington, D.C., where Baker functioned as the mob-teamster “man in Washington.” J. Evetts Haley wrote that Bobby Baker “dealt in everything”: ...brokerage on American beef to Haiti with Texas millionaires; big and questionable building promotions in Washington; business with notorious Las Vegas gamblers; and especially, lucrative friendships with the choicest call girls, sometimes thereby laying the groundwork for tolerance, if not for outright blackmail, of some of the Congressional stud-horses on Capitol Hill. Bobby Baker was in position, with influence to peddle, and he believed in peddling it at a profit. On a $19,600 job, he had in a relatively few years parlayed his influence into a two million dollar estate. Meanwhile, the calculating Kennedy brothers, the cold and ruthless Attorney General and the President, adept themselves at midnight maneuver, knew what was going on. They, their ivy leaguers and their Irish mafia, had never trusted Lyndon and had never been happy with the political shotgun wedding that had dictated his choice as running mate. Consequently they had so relegated the Vice- President to the wings that he had become a national television joke—the worst kind: “Lyndon Johnson? Who’s that?”— ”Where’s he?”....the evidence seems conclusive that the Kennedys had decided to ditch him as their running mate in the coming election—despite all the usual disclaimers to the contrary. The sharpest political observers in Washington were dead convinced of their design, to be effected probably in January. The Kennedys calculated the way in which to make him a thorough political liability, even beyond Democratic redemption, was to expose his close friend whom he had made Secretary to the Democratic Majority—this free-wheeling peddler of everything from favors for organized gamblers to the ardor of the fairest and youngest in public prostitution. [699] "},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"Were the Kennedys deliberately moving to expose Johnson’s scandal with Bobby Baker and thereby have a reason to move him from the 1964 ticket? In a press conference on November 14, 1963, President Kennedy was asked about the Bobby Baker scandal. He replied, “...Mr. Baker is now being investigated, and I think we will have a good deal more about Mr. Baker before we are through. Other people may be investigated as time goes on. We just try to do the best we can.” [700] Evelyn Lincoln wrote that the day President Kennedy left for Dallas they discussed the Bobby Baker case and the effects of the scandal on the campaign. Kennedy told her that he planned in his second term to “advocate changing some of the outmoded rules and regulations in the Congress, such as the seniority rule.” He said, “To do this I will need as a running mate in sixty-four a man who believes as I do.” [701] Lincoln wrote: I was fascinated by this conversation and wrote it down verbatim in my diary. I was extremely proud of the man with whom I was associated. I was also glad that I could be a part of the goals and ambitions he was striving for in the future. He had talked and I had just listened, but I did venture one question. We had not seen Mr. Johnson since he left for Texas in late October. Now I asked, “Who is your choice as a running-mate?” He looked straight ahead, and without hesitating he replied, “At this time I am thinking about Governor Terry Sanford of North Carolina. But it will not be Lyndon .” This news was not shocking to me. It had been my feeling for quite a while that Lyndon Johnson would not be the Vice-Presidential candidate in the next campaign. In fact, I had discussed this possibility with my husband and friends many times. [702] (Emphasis added) After the assassination, the newly ensconced President Johnson was still very worried about Bobby Baker, even though the day after he became president the organized crime section of the Justice Department stopped receiving information on Baker from Hoover’s FBI. The New York Times reported that “Department sources had complained that the FBI had ‘virtually pulled out of the effort’....” [703] Illustrating Johnson’s fear of revelation of the Bobby Baker scandal, David Scheim wrote: The hush on Baker may be explained by a conversation between Johnson and House Speaker John McCormack as reported in The Washington Payoff by ex-Washington lobbyist Robert Winter- Berger. On February 4, 1964, Winter-Berger was discussing public relations with McCormack in McCormack’s Washington office. President Johnson then barged in and began ranting hysterically, Winter-Berger reported, oblivious to the lobbyist’s presence. During his long tirade, Johnson said: John, that son of a bitch [Bobby Baker] is going to ruin me. If that cocksucker talks, I’m gonna land in jail....I practically raised that motherfucker, and now he’s gonna make me the first President of the United States to spend the last days of his life behind bars. When Johnson finally noticed Winter-Berger’s presence, McCormack explained that the visiting lobbyist was a close friend of Nat Voloshen, who was a Mob fixer of enormous influence. Johnson then became enthusiastic, exclaiming, “Nat can get to Bobby. They’re friends. Have Nat get to Bobby.” When Winter-Berger volunteered that he had an appointment with Voloshen the next day, Johnson told Winter-Berger: Tell Nat that I want him to get in touch with Bobby Baker as soon as possible—tomorrow if he can. Tell Nat to tell Bobby that I will give him a million dollars if he takes this rap. Bobby must not talk. I’ll see to it that he gets a million-dollar settlement. Given a subsequent scandal involving intercessions for Mobsters from McCormack’s office at"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"Voloshen’s behest, the recounted tirade would hardly have been exceptional in that office... . [704] Johnson seems to have believed that even as president of the United States he would have been sent to the penitentiary had his role in the scandal been uncovered. Imagine how he must have felt before the assassination when he was only the vice president and was about to be dropped from the ticket. It certainly appears that he considered his very survival to be at stake unless the Bobby Baker scandal was squelched. In 1967 Joachim Joesten wrote: “The Baker scandal, then, is truly the hidden key to the assassination or, to be more exact, to its timing. For the roots of the drama undoubtedly go back to the 1960 Convention, as I have already set forth, what the Baker affair did was to crystallize the more or less vague plans to eliminate Kennedy which had already been in existence. The murder of a president is hazardous business under the best of circumstance. It takes an element of urgency to put such a plan into effect. The threat of complete exposure which faced Johnson in the Baker scandal provided that final impulse. He now was forced by the instinct of self-preservation to give the go-ahead signal to the plotters who had long been waiting for the right opportunity.” [705] (Emphasis added) It is interesting to note that Joesten, a European writer unencumbered by our American innocence, could so quickly see the truth of the assassination and the sham of its cover-up by United States authorities. Counter Arguments In light of the damning activities of Lyndon Johnson immediately following the assassination, we should ask ourselves if there is possibly some explanation for Johnson’s actions, other than that he was part of the conspiracy from beginning to end. So let us look at several possible levels of involvement or scenarios in the conspiracy that could explain Johnson’s behavior after the assassination. First, we can examine the hypothesis that Johnson did not know about the assassination in advance. To do this, we have to arbitrarily, without any reason to do so, set aside Madeleine Brown’s incriminating statement concerning Johnson’s advanced knowledge of the plot and his description of the plotters—that is, U.S. intelligence and Texas oil men. We then could conceivably explain his behavior as a fearful reaction that the American people could not deal with the truth; that there were real possibilities of foreign conspirators (such as the Soviet Union or Cuba) that could lead to a nuclear war; and that Johnson, in his presidential role, should embark on a cover-up to support the lone-assassin hoax. In search of an answer to this question, I arranged to have dinner with retired Navy Admiral Taswell Shepard in Washington, D.C. Shepard had been one of John Kennedy’s top military aides at the time of the assassination; he was one of the first persons to brief Johnson when he returned from Dallas on November 22, 1963. I had written to the admiral in preparation for the interview and asked him several questions, one of which was whether or not there was a palpable sense of fear in the White House of an imminent nuclear war because of the assassination. The admiral told me, “One thing I can say for certain —when Johnson came back that night, there was no sense of an imminent nuclear war.” He went on to say, “The reason that I can say this is that I know what that feeling is like. I was with Kennedy for the whole Cuban missile crisis.” Admiral Shepard, who was in a position to know, also told me that, contrary to any accounts, Kennedy had always treated Lyndon Johnson very well and with respect. When I questioned the admiral about the autopsy and casket switch, he knew nothing of any decoy ambulance or casket switches. He said that Admiral Burkley was the one to talk to about the autopsy; but Burkley was"},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":"dead. (He also later wrote to me and said that he could not believe that anyone in government had anything to do with the death of the president.) The admiral’s comments are important. If there were no real sense of concern about war with the Soviet Union, why was Johnson using that as a reason for many of his actions in orchestrating the cover- up? The evidence in this book shows that Johnson knew very well that the Soviets were not involved [706] and that he should have seen through the obviously false evidence of Cuban involvement. In fact, on November 30, 1963 we know he was informed by John McCone, head of the CIA, that its investigation had shown that the evidence in Mexico City of Cuban involvement was false . (See Chapter 19.) Also, as noted earlier, recently released HSCA testimony of CIA’s high-ranking officer John Scelso reveals that his initial report within two days after the assassination informed Richard Helms that Cuba and the Soviet Union were not involved in the assassination, and that Helms forwarded the report to President Johnson. Scelso had also informed CIA top officials, in a report with copies to the White House directed to McGeorge Bundy, that an Army cryptographer, Private Eugene B. Dinkin, had revealed his advanced knowledge of a plot to kill President Kennedy that involved the military and right wing, and that the plot would be blamed on a “Communist or Negro.” (See Chapter 23.) This demolishes any argument that Johnson’s actions in the cover-up were sincerely to prevent nuclear war. It is therefore virtually certain that Johnson used the war scare for his own sinister reasons to manipulate the Dallas police, Chief Justice Earl Warren, the Congress, government employees, and military personnel, for the purpose of orchestrating the cover-up. Manchester, Joesten, et al., cite Johnson’s early talk of a worldwide conspiracy and possible war with the Soviets. Manchester wrote that Earl Warren first refused and then accepted the assignment to head the presidential commission. Warren said: I saw McGeorge Bundy first. He took me in, and the President told me how serious the situation was. He said there had been wild rumors, and that there was the international situation to think of. He said he had just talked to Dean Rusk, who was concerned, and he also mentioned the head of the Atomic Energy Commission, who had told him how many millions of people would be killed in an atomic war. The only way to dispel these rumors, he said, was to have an independent and responsible commission, and that there was no one to head it except the highest judicial officer in the country. I told him how I felt. He said that if the public became aroused against Castro and Khrushchev there might be war. “You’ve been in uniform before,” he said, “and if I asked you, you would put on the uniform again for your country.” I said, “Of course.” “This is more important than that,” he said. “If you’re putting it like that,” I said, “I can’t say no .” [707]"},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"Johnson and Hoover had a close personal relationship over the years when they reigned supreme in their roles in Washington, D.C.

In a conversation with Senator Richard Russell on November 29, 1963 at 8:55 p.m., Johnson informed Russell that he had announced the formation of the commission and Russell would be a member. This was before Russell had agreed to become a member. Because of its sweeping significance, and the rare opportunity it provides to obtain insight by Johnson’s own words, major portions of the transcript are included here verbatim from the dictabelt [emphasis and footnotes added].

Johnson: Of this Special Commission. [709] Russell: Oh, you have already? Johnson: Yes...may I read it to you....The President announced that he is appointing a Special Commission to study and report upon all the facts and circumstances relating to the assassination of the late President John F. Kennedy and the subsequent violent death of the man charged with the assassination. The President stated that the Majority and Minority leadership of the Senate and the House had been consulted with respect to the proposed Special Commission....The members of the Special Commission are: Chief Earl Warren, Chairman; Senator Richard Russell, Georgia; Senator John Sherman Cooper, Kentucky; Rep. Hale Boggs, Louisiana; Rep. Gerald Ford, Michigan; Honorable Allen Dulles, Washington; Honorable John J. McCloy, New York. The President stated the Special Commission is to be instructed to evaluate all available information concerning the subject inquiry. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, pursuant to an earlier directive of the President is making complete investigations of the facts. An inquiry is scheduled by the Texas Court of Inquiry convened by the Attorney General of Texas under Texas law. The Special Commission will have before it all the evidence uncovered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and all the information available to any agencies of the Federal Government. The Attorney General of Texas has also offered his cooperation. All Federal agencies and offices are being directed to furnish services in cooperation to the Special Commission. The Commission will also be empowered to conduct any further investigation as deemed desirable. The President is instructing the Special Commission to satisfy itself that the truth is known as far as it can be discovered and to report its findings and conclusions to him to the American people and to the world.

Russell: Goodnight. This transcript is amazing. It confirms the following: (a) Johnson’s extraordinary ability to persuade politicians and officials in Washington to do his bidding, no matter how repugnant to them; and the weakness of seemingly strong and important men to be browbeaten and manipulated by Johnson. [718] (b) That Earl Warren had a bad reputation (according to some people). (c) Johnson’s use of the nuclear war scare when in fact he himself did not believe it. (d) Johnson’s revelation that the only purpose of the commission was to evaluate the Hoover report, which placed Johnson in control of the results via Hoover. (e) The use of the “Mexico City incident,” alluding to Oswald’s trip to Mexico City, which as earlier discussed was set up by the conspirators for the very purpose that Johnson is now using on Russell. And the White House had already received information from the CIA that discounted it. The CIA had informed the White House that the Soviets and Cuba were not involved. (f) Johnson’s crude and insensitive pleasure in telling how Earl Warren cried and broke down under Johnson’s brow-beating—typical of Johnson’s renowned grossness and disregard for the dignity of others. These transcripts tell a remarkable story of a man who appeared to know exactly what he had planned to do and went into action immediately on the night of the assassination, calling dozens of influential people throughout the United States to sweet-talk them and appeal to their vanity and their need to be connected to the seat of power. It seems as though Johnson had cleverly thought through every contingency related to how he would take over the government and cover up the crime. And it clearly, in my opinion, shows his use of the false nuclear war scare to orchestrate the cover-up. It seems reasonable to ask how all of this could have gone on so swiftly and smoothly if Johnson had not been brought into the conspiracy before the fact. And, again, it should be emphasized that the elaborate forgery and manipulation of the evidence, on a grand scale, is without plausible explanation other than for sinister purposes related to Lyndon Johnson’s culpability. We shall now examine another counter-argument that might seem plausible, but on scrutiny falls apart for the same reasons as above. It goes like this: Johnson did not know about the assassination in advance, but immediately after the shooting he was contacted by the conspirators (say the Texas High Cabal) and told, suddenly, that he would have to cover up the crime because things had gone wrong. This makes some sense because the right-wing Texas interests had Johnson in their pockets due to his corruption. Johnson was deeply beholden to the extreme right wing, H. L. Hunt as a prime example. But, again, this scenario is of dubious believability because of the intricacy of the steps to be taken in the cover-up that would have required advanced planning, and because of Johnson’s steady performance immediately after the assassination, which bordered on the eerie. He was totally calm and composed, at least on the surface and in public. While almost everyone else was in disarray, Johnson appeared to be in complete control of himself and seemed to know exactly what he was doing. If he suddenly had been confronted by others to conduct the cover-up, it would seem likely it would have thrown him into a state of confusion. There was no evidence of disarray or confusion. Also, as mentioned before, it does not make sense that a group of conspirators would assassinate the president and depend on the vice president to react and behave appropriately if he had not been warned in advance of what was going to happen. The"},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"conspirators would certainly have known that they would be heavily dependent on him for the success of the cover-up and would therefore have insisted that he be in the plot from the beginning. This leads to a scenario that I believe makes the most sense. It is that Johnson knew about the assassination in advance but was not involved in its original conception. As noted earlier, the allegation that Johnson had foreknowledge is supported by his mistress of twenty years, Madeleine Brown, [719] who has stated on national television (at least twice) that Johnson implied to her that the assassination was going to take place. The night before it happened, he said to her, “After tomorrow the ———Kennedys would never embarrass me again.” She also said that he told her after the assassination that U.S. intelligence people and right-wing oil men were behind it. In this scenario, Johnson could have been exempt from initial planning of the conspiracy, but was told about it before the event and told what he was to do in the cover-up. In other words, he could have been persuaded, before the fact, by the Texas right wing because of the incriminating evidence they had on him concerning other crimes. And, as earlier noted, Johnson could have been strongly influenced by the threat of the Bobby Baker and Billie Sol Estes cases that were unfolding. And, of course, there is Johnson’s obsession to become president of the United States; this would be his last and only chance— and his golden opportunity. It seems very plausible that Johnson would have been too fearful to resist the blackmail, and, after knowing about the plot, his crafty, brilliant mind went to work with gusto to plan what he would do to fulfill his role. And we must also consider that blackmail was not even necessary—that only a suggestion by the “Texas High Cabal” was all that was needed to bring him aboard. Two things are clear: Johnson’s motive to orchestrate the cover-up was not for patriotic reasons, and Johnson was not out of the loop. Johnson’s cover-up actions began within one and one-half hours of the fatal shot at Kennedy, when Kennedy’s body was removed from the casket on Air Force One at Love Field in Dallas. How could this have occurred without Johnson knowing about it? This, combined with Johnson’s motive, means, and opportunity— and taking into account Johnson’s history of venality and his history of deviousness and political jujitsu—all fit together to make it highly conceivable that Johnson was involved in the conspiracy, probably very deeply, but at the very least knew about it in advance . Perhaps more evidence will be forthcoming that will fill in some of the gaps in comprehending Johnson’s role in the assassination. Although some researchers believe that Johnson was the mastermind of the assassination, I am not inclined to believe it. I am inclined to believe that the assassination grew out of a general revolt among Kennedy’s enemies and that Johnson was brought in as a necessary part of the plot. Only by grasping the totality of the man Johnson as an extremely complex person capable of horrendously ruthless, self-serving, and despicable behavior—compulsively driven by his obsession for control, power, and renown—can one appreciate how central and pivotal he was as part of the conspiracy to assassinate the president. The assassination enabled Johnson to become president and save himself from political oblivion and disgrace. Lyndon Johnson Viewed as Tragic Character in History Lyndon Johnson’s presidency became a tragedy. By the time Johnson left office, the reverence of the American people for the presidency was shattered, undermined by his lies and duplicity. The Vietnam war was drastically escalated under Johnson (following a limited escalation by Kennedy) to became one"},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"of the darkest stains on the history of the United States. Over 58,000 U.S. soldiers were killed and over 500,000 wounded. Several millions of Southeast Asians ultimately were killed. The faith of the American people in their government has not recovered fully to the present day. Robert Caro wrote, “The presidency, thirty-sixth in the history of the republic, of Lyndon Baines Johnson was a watershed presidency, one of the great divides in American history, in the evolution not only of the country’s policies both foreign and domestic, but also of its image in the eyes of the world and in its own eyes....” [720] Recognizing that Lyndon Johnson was part of the conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy is something that I have come to reluctantly. Only in the course of writing this book has the realization fully penetrated. When I interviewed Robert McNamara in Washington, D.C., in 1994, I asked him whether or not he believed that Johnson was part of a conspiracy. He said it was impossible for him to believe that Johnson was behind a plot to kill Kennedy. When I asked him if he thought it possible for Johnson to have known about the plot in advance, he paused awhile and then said, “Yes, it’s possible, but I still don’t endorse the idea.” Lyndon Johnson will live in infamy for all of history for his role in Vietnam [721] and the suspicion that he plotted to assassinate his president, John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Is this indictment deserved? I think so. The reader must be his or her own judge and jury. I believe that it can be said with certainty that Johnson deserves this dark place in history most especially because of his role in the cover-up of the Kennedy assassination. If he were innocent, or hadn’t been so corrupted, he would have gone after the killers. Did he do everything in his power to bring the total forces of the government to investigate every lead; root out every possibility; settle, once and for all, the question of conspiracy? He did nothing of the kind. He did quite the opposite. He did all in his power to pin the crime on one man while at the same time, by his own words, he “suspected” a conspiracy. [722] For what other reason would he have orchestrated the cover-up so thoroughly—not just by his establishing a commission to whitewash the crime—but by his own direct actions? The foregoing has shown the bad side of Lyndon Johnson. Was there a good side? There is no doubt that after he became president Johnson set out to create a liberal revolution in the United States. He was a major force in the enactment of civil rights legislation. Using his enormous energies, manipulative powers, and legislative prowess, he pushed through Medicare and Medicaid to provide health care for the aged and poor; he pushed through the Head Start program for underprivileged children—which has been a major success; he articulated affirmative action rights and used the presidency as a pulpit to dramatize the blight of poverty in contrast to unprecedented wealth; he created the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts; and he pushed through a massive housing bill and consumer protection laws. But even Johnson’s admirers, those who worked with him closely over the years during his presidency, considered him to be an extremely complex and crude person. Joseph Califano, who was Johnson’s administrative assistant during his entire five years as president, wrote: The Lyndon Johnson I worked with was brave and brutal, compassionate and cruel, incredibly intelligent and infuriatingly insensitive, with a shrewd and uncanny instinct for the jugular of his allies and adversaries. He could be altruistic and petty, caring and crude, generous and petulant, bluntly honest and calculatingly devious all within the same few minutes. He had a marvelous, if often crude, sense of humor. Once he made up his mind, his determination to succeed usually ran over or around whoever and whatever got in his way. He used his prodigious energy—which produced second, third, and fourth winds, as others, allies and adversaries alike, slumped in exhaustion—to mount a social revolution and to control everyone and everything around him. He"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"gave new meaning to the word Machiavellian, as he gave new hope to the disadvantaged . [723] Could it be that Lyndon Johnson, after having participated in the assassination of his president, was driven by his conscience to remake the United States for the sake of the poor and disadvantaged? We shall never know. [724] This complex mixture of good and evil, of good deeds following evil doings, is one of the great paradoxes of human existence. We see it all about us. While pursuing the legal research for this book, I came across a court case that struck me as being not only pertinent to the murderers of John Kennedy but also poetry of an almost Shakespearian quality. It is a pleading by Daniel Webster before the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in 1830 concerning a trial in which Webster was using hearsay evidence of a remarkable kind. It bears reading to shed light on Lyndon Johnson’s torment after the assassination. [John Francis Knapp was tried in 1830 for the murder of one Joseph White. The prosecution, headed by Daniel Webster, claimed that Knapp aided and abetted one Crowninshield, who actually struck the fatal blows. It was therefore crucial to the prosecution to show Crowninshield’s guilt— even though Crowninshield himself had committed suicide before the trial. In his closing argument, Daniel Webster discussed the probative value of the suicide on the issue of Crowninshield’s guilt. Webster first describes the murder, then goes on:] He has done the murder—no eye has seen him, no ear has heard him. The secret is his own, and it is safe! Ah! Gentlemen, that was a dreadful mistake. Such a secret can be safe nowhere. The whole creation of God has neither nook nor corner, where the guilty can bestow it, and say it is safe. Not to speak of that eye which glances through all disguises, and beholds everything, as in the splendor of noon, such secrets of guilt are never safe from detection, even by men. True it is, generally speaking, that “murder will out.” True it is, that Providence hath so ordained, and doth so govern things, that those who break the great law of heaven, by shedding man’s blood, seldom succeed in avoiding discovery. Especially, in a case exciting so much attention as this, discovery must come, and will come, sooner or later. A thousand eyes turn at once to explore every man, every thing, every circumstance, connected with the time and place; a thousand ears catch every whisper; a thousand excited minds intensely dwell on the scene, shedding all their light, and ready to kindle the slightest circumstance into a blaze of discovery. Meantime the guilty soul cannot keep its own secret. It is false to itself; or rather it feels an irresistible impulse of conscience to be true to itself. It labors under its guilty possession, and knows not what to do with it. The human heart was not made for the residence of such an inhabitant. It finds itself preyed on by a torment which it does not acknowledge to God nor man. A vulture is devouring it, and it can ask no sympathy or assistance, either from heaven or earth. The secret which the murderer possesses soon comes to possess him; and, like the evil spirits of which we read, it overcomes him, and leads him whithersoever it will. He feels it beating at his heart, rising to his throat, and demanding disclosure. He thinks the whole world sees it in his face, reads it in his eyes, and almost hears its workings in the very silence of his thoughts. It has become his master. It betrays his discretion, it breaks down his courage, it conquers his prudence. When suspicions, from without, begin to embarrass him, and the net of circumstance to entangle him, the fatal secret struggles with still greater violence to burst forth. It must be confessed, it will be confessed; there is no refuge from confession but suicide, and suicide is confession.

Johnson was afraid of being alone at night and always wanted someone near him before he went to sleep; he would ask aides to sit outside his room until he could go to sleep. On January 22, 1973 Johnson died as he was taking an afternoon rest at his Texas ranch. His heart gave out just as he was picking up the phone to call the ranch switchboard for help from the Secret Service. He was alone. [726] He died at the young age of sixty-four, appearing to be a broken old man with hippie-like long white hair, four years after he voluntarily left the presidency without seeking a second term. Doris Kearns Goodwin was persuaded by Johnson to write his memoirs with him in the final months of his life at the LBJ Ranch. She was in contact with him until two days before his death. But Goodwin wrote that Johnson could never concentrate his attention on the memoirs. In her book Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream, she wrote of Johnson’s mental deterioration near the end of his term as president and after he withdrew from the 1968 presidential race and returned to his ranch. She wrote, “Johnson became a hermit. He granted only one interview, attended a few public meetings, and rarely left the ranch.” [727] She wrote that Johnson was in “extreme despair,” and would comment, “They’ll get me anyhow, no matter how hard I try...” [728] He talked obsessively of conspiracy—those out to get him—the news media, the Harvard eastern establishment, etc. He had once expressed to her, after he became president, feelings that his authority had been wrongfully acquired and would be taken away when its illegitimacy was discovered. [729] Doris Goodwin interpreted this as largely having to do with his having become president only because of the assassination of Kennedy, and remorse about the Vietnam war. But I suggest that it may have been his remorse about having participated in murder, and in particular, the assassination of his president. Doris Goodwin only hinted once any possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy. She quoted literary critic Irving Howe describing the national mood. [730] Two assassinations, each ghastly in its own right, and each uncovering still another side of our social pathology; callousness, maybe planned negligence on the part of the Dallas police; fourth- grade children in the South cheering the news that a “nigger loving” President had been murdered; subversion of the processes of law enforcement to the demands of television...it is all too much. (Emphasis added) Nowhere in Doris Goodwin’s book was Billie Sol Estes mentioned. Nowhere was Cliff Carter mentioned. Bobby Baker was mentioned on only one page, with nothing about his scandals and crimes and their connection to Johnson. Nor was H. L. Hunt mentioned, nor, amazingly, J. Edgar Hoover. This is not to downgrade Goodwin’s well-written and excellent book. She was attempting to look at the human and psychological side of Johnson based on her close relationship with him as a White House aide and while working with him at the LBJ Ranch. I presume that she felt that if she delved deeply into the possibility of his involvement in the JFK assassination conspiracy, it would have derailed the entire book. The same can possibly be said of all of Johnson’s major biographers—Robert Caro (thus far in his first two volumes; a third volume is supposed to be forthcoming); Robert Dalleck; even J. Evetts Haley, who hated LBJ with a passion. These authors did not look into the abyss; or it they did, they soon looked away. Doris Goodwin, in a recent television interview, commented that Johnson had tried to will his own death in his latter years at the LBJ Ranch.

Johnson had told several people during and after his term in office that he believed John Kennedy had been murdered by a conspiracy. He implicated the CIA at one time and the CIA and Cubans at another. He never mentioned the Mafia. And, astonishingly, Johnson even mused that John Kennedy was assassinated as “God’s retribution” for his participation in the assassinations of Trujillo and President Diem! This was reported in an interview of Robert Kennedy by historian John Bartlow Martin: Kennedy: ...Lyndon Johnson said to Pierre Salinger that he wasn’t sure but that the assassination of President Kennedy didn’t take place in retribution for his participation in the assassinations of Trujillo and President Diem. Martin: Did he mean divine retribution? Or was he suggesting conspiracy? Kennedy: No, divine retribution. He said that. Then he went on and said that, when he was growing up, somebody he knew—who had misbehaved—was on a sled or something, ran into a tree, hit his head, and became cross-eyed. He said that was God’s retribution for people who were bad. So you should be careful of cross-eyed people because God put his mark on them. And that this might very well be God’s retribution to President Kennedy for his participation in the assassination of these two people. [731] (Emphasis added) Were Johnson’s self-serving statements an attempt to relieve his guilt or protect himself in history? If so, it would not have been the first time that he sought to design his own image in history contrary to the truth. But I still struggle with this question: How, despite the fact that Lyndon Johnson’s basic survival [732] as a politician was at stake, and that he might have had to go to prison because of the Bobby Baker or Billie Sol Estes scandals, could he have done what it appears he did—that is, become the first elected official in the history of the United States who conspired to assassinate his president? If this is true, and I believe that the evidence shows that it is, Johnson’s story is an extraordinary American tragedy. *** As this book went to press, I received from author John Davis a copy of a letter by Evelyn Lincoln, President Kennedy’s secretary for twelve years before he was assassinated, and then the Kennedy family’s representative at the National Archives. The letter, dated October 7, 1994, was addressed to Richard Duncan, a school teacher at Northside Middle School in Roanoke, Virginia. [733] Dear Richard: It was a pleasure to receive your kind letter concerning your desire to obtain my assessment of President Kennedy’s administration and assassination to pass along to your students. I am sending along to you an article which was written by Muriel Pressman for the “Lady’s Circle” October 1964, and was recently reprinted in a current issue of that magazine, which will give you an insight into my impression of the man. As for [ sic ] the assassination is concerned it is my belief that there was a conspiracy because there were those that disliked him and felt the only way to get rid of him was to assassinate him. These five conspirators, in my opinion, were Lyndon B. Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover, the Mafia, the CIA and the Cubans in Florida. The House Intelligence Committee investigation, also, came to the conclusion that there was a conspiracy. My very best wishes to you and your students.

It was a backlash against the Kennedy brothers for what they were intent on accomplishing. The seeds of the plot to kill John Kennedy began to grow because he and his brother were determined to seize control of the power structure in the United States. This objective included the destruction of organized crime. President Kennedy was also determined to assert his constitutional power as president to control the military and the CIA. These people had been allowed to operate with little presidential control since the end of World War II. Also, President Kennedy had reached a decision to drop Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover from government roles. Because of their corrupt and bizarre backgrounds, which would have been exposed, this would have been a personal catastrophe for both Johnson and Hoover. But the Kennedys tragically underestimated the reaction and power of those whom they threatened. The Mafia joined forces with a few Kennedy haters from the CIA, radical anti-Castro Cuban exiles, and others in the extreme right wing, both civilian and military. A plan was formulated to assassinate the president. The plan included tactics to make it appear that the assassination was the work of a deranged Communist linked to Fidel Castro or the Soviet Union. Hoover and Johnson were brought into the plot. Their role was to prevent a serious investigation of the crime. The resulting combination of forces became unstoppable because Johnson and Hoover controlled the law itself. The assassination accomplished several purposes for the conspirators: First, those who were being directly threatened by the Kennedys were saved from imprisonment or disgrace; second, the political power center of the United States shifted from the liberal Northeast to the conservative Southwest; and third, the nation’s anti-Communist paranoia was accommodated. *** There was no government agency or civilian organization behind the plot; only individuals . The combination of J. Edgar Hoover, H. L. Hunt, and Lyndon Johnson—all in the plot—had the blackmail, the money, and the political power to see to it that the crime would never be seriously investigated. The FBI investigation was a sham. Although the plot seemingly involved a large number of people, most were on the fringes and did not know what they were involved in. Many were deceived into believing that they were in anti-Castro operations. Very likely hundreds of powerful people were glad to see it happen; some even expected it. But only three or four key people needed to know the full nature of the plot. Even Johnson and Hoover did not need to know the details—just their roles in a cover-up if required of them. By the use of cut-outs the money providers did not need to know who did the job and the assassins didn’t need to know the source of the money. Those who set up Oswald didn’t need to know for what purpose. The shooters from the School Book Depository didn’t need to know about the shooters from the grassy knoll. The assassination was a mystery even to some of those who financed it and almost certainly to those who did the shooting. It was not possible for the plotters to keep their plans secret. It was leaking like a sieve; time had run out. Action had to be taken in Dallas despite the fact that Dallas right wingers would be the first suspects. Earlier plans to assassinate Kennedy in Miami, Chicago, and Los Angeles had fallen through. Kennedy had to be killed in Dallas. With all of the leaks, it was bound to be picked up by the Kennedy family or the news media unless Johnson and Hoover took over the government very soon and permitted ruthless"},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"silencing, by murder if necessary, of those who were talking to set an example of what would happen to others. The conspirators were already guilty of treason, having met and conspired to kill the president. So the detailed logistics of the shooting had to be finalized within the last few weeks before the fatal event, perhaps explaining some of the things that went wrong. Solid evidence shows that no fewer than nine people told others, before November 22, 1963, that Kennedy would be assassinated. These were: Joseph Milteer, Homer Eschevarria, Rose Cheramie, Richard Case Nagell, Eugene Dinkin, one of the visitors to Silvia Odio, Jimmy Hoffa, Santo Trafficante, and Carlos Marcello. This evidence was not acted upon because all of it went through J. Edgar Hoover or the Secret Service, who either buried it or failed to take action to protect the president when he went to Dallas. Eugene Dinkin predicted that it would be in November 1963, would be a right-wing/U.S. military plot, and that it would be blamed on a communist or a “Negro.” That is exactly what happened. The assassination was a right-wing plot, did occur in November 1963, did include individuals in CIA/military intelligence, and there was fabricated evidence of a meeting in the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City, in which it was falsely reported that Castro’s Cubans handed to Oswald and a “Negro,” $6,500 to assassinate President Kennedy. And Joseph Milteer predicted that it would be a plot by the “patriots,” would be blamed on the Communists, would be by rifle fire from a tall building, and someone would be picked up to throw the public off the track. That also is what happened. The prime scientific evidence tying the conspiracy to government officials in Washington is the alteration of the Zapruder film and the alteration of the autopsy x-rays. These and other forgeries were done on a massive scale. There is no way that all of these actions could have been accomplished without the active involvement of the Secret Service, the FBI, and government officials—going all the way to Lyndon Johnson. Other crucial evidence that ties the crime to high officials involves (1) the incredible vanishing brain; and (2) the theft of Kennedy’s body followed by surgery on the head to remove ballistic evidence of a second gunman. This is the most difficult evidence for many to accept. Nevertheless, the evidence of the switching of Kennedy’s body from the bronze ceremonial casket to a shipping casket; the evidence that the body was delivered secretly to the rear of Bethesda Naval Hospital; and the evidence that photographs of the brain in the National Archives are not of Kennedy’s brain, leave no other tenable conclusion. A trial by an impartial and discerning jury, in my opinion, would have found this evidence to meet reasonable doubt standards. It is virtually inconceivable that Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover would have orchestrated or permitted these frantic, dangerous, last-minute criminal actions in the cover-up unless they themselves were part of the master conspiracy. Extensive evidence leads to the inescapable conclusion that a combination of U.S. government intelligence operatives, radical Cuban exiles, and Texas right-wing extremists played a major role in the assassination. The Texas right-wing extremists included H. L. Hunt, retired General Edwin Walker, and retired General Charles Willoughby. These men (or their surrogates) met at different times with CIA assassination specialist Colonel William Bishop. The meetings began in early 1963 and continued to November 1963. Attending at least one of the meetings with Walker and Bishop were Cuban exile Felipe Vidal Santiago, who was a CIA agent, and Roy Hargraves. During this meeting the assassination of John F. Kennedy was discussed. Hargraves was a member of Gerald Patrick Hemming’s paramilitary group, Interpen, in Florida, which was sponsored by U.S. intelligence. Vidal was a close associate of Hemming. Vidal and Hargraves were closely linked to Cuban exile leader Rolando Masferrer, who was closely linked to Jimmy Hoffa and the Mafia. According to Colonel Bishop, Masferrer was handed $500,000 of Hoffa money for the purpose of killing John F. Kennedy. This payment took place seventeen days before"},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"the assassination. Despite the fact that there is a large body of evidence virtually encircling Gerald Patrick Hemming, indicating his deep involvement in the assassination, he has denied his direct participation. But the evidence against him is substantial. He was closely associated with Felipe Vidal, Roy Hargraves, and at least three others, all of whom were to various degrees entwined in the plot at an operational level. Hemming was also closely associated with John Martino, who confessed to his involvement in the assassination before his death to news reporter John Cummings, and also confessed to his (Martino’s) wife. Hemming has admitted that he once lived in a safe house for a short time with Herminio Diaz, who, according to Cuban exile leader Tony Cuesta, was involved in the assassination. In addition, Hemming’s man, Ronald Ponce de Leon, according to Hemming, was involved with John Martino in the assassination. In extensive taped interviews, Hemming told me that he was offered a contract by Guy Banister in New Orleans in June, 1962, to kill Kennedy. He said he turned it down. He also said that he was again offered a contract to kill Kennedy by wealthy Texans and retired military men in the Dallas Petroleum Club in July 1963. He said he also turned that down. Hemming claims that he lost control of his Interpen group and that some of them, and his other associates, went to Dallas on November 22, 1963, against his advice, while he stayed in Miami. The story on Hemming is incomplete. In any event, it is apparent that some of his associates, if not Hemming himself, played ancillary roles in the assassination. A full release by the government of all documents pertaining to Hemming will likely reveal the extent of this involvement. (See Appendix B for a list of documents concerning Hemming, many of which have not been released.) In addition, there is substantial evidence, including statements from Colonel Bishop and Hemming, that Felipe Vidal was involved with Oswald in the staged shooting at General Edwin Walker in April 1963. Colonel Bishop stated in a taped interview with writer Gary Shaw (when Bishop knew that he was going to die) that he picked up Vidal in Miami in April 1963 and drove him to Dallas. Also, according to Hemming (the date confirmed in an HSCA document), Vidal was picked up in Miami by his CIA case officer and driven to Dallas four days before the assassination, and returned by plane to Miami on the evening of November 22, 1963. According to General Escalante, Vidal told Cuban intelligence in a taped interview shortly before he was executed in April 1964 that he had been picked up in Miami in early November 1963 by Colonel Bishop and driven to Dallas, where he met with wealthy Texans in the Petroleum Club. This trip was confirmed by HSCA documents. Thus we have independently corroborated evidence of three separate trips wherein Vidal was picked up in Miami by a CIA assassination specialist and driven to Dallas, and met with Texas oil men and a retired military officer, General Walker. And during some of these meetings with Walker, General Willoughby was present. One of the paradoxes of the Kennedy assassination is that the plotters and sponsors at the top of the conspiracy are more accurately identifiable than the shooters and helpers at Dealey Plaza. The reason for this is that the men at the top—Johnson, Hoover, H. L. Hunt, Mafia chieftains—were required to personally intervene in the cover-up when things went wrong. This is seen in (1) Johnson’s hands-on suppression of the investigation in Dallas and the manipulation of the autopsy; (2) the necessity of Mafia minion Jack Ruby being ordered to kill Oswald; (3) Hoover’s participation in the alteration of the Zapruder film, and his outrageous suppression and manipulation of all of the evidence; and (4) H. L. Hunt’s purchase on November 22 or 23 of a first copy of the Zapruder film and his inquiries as to the security of Oswald in the Dallas jail the night before Oswald was shot. And, of course, only this unique combination of conspirators had the cumulative power to make the assassination happen and orchestrate the cover-up. The shooters and the men at Dealey Plaza were, in effect, only ciphers—hired guns. However, piecing all the evidence together, it can reasonably be concluded that there were probably three"},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"assassination teams in Dallas on November 22. Based on the preponderance of the evidence, the first team was staffed in part by CIA/MI rogues and their associates in the Cuban exile community, and was stationed in the Texas School Book Depository and in at least one other building at Dealey Plaza. This team performed the functions of firing diversionary shots from the School Book Depository; acting as a third back-up team; providing get-away cars and airplanes; setting up Oswald, and disposing of him after the assassination. But Oswald slipped away, later was captured, and had to be shot by Jack Ruby on the orders of the Mafia. A second team of assassins was behind the picket fence on the grassy knoll. Extensive statements of French assassin Christian David, supported by a witness considered to be reliable, and also supported by corroborative circumstances, indicates that this team was recruited by Mafia chieftain Santo Trafficante, Jr. through the Guerini family in Marseilles, France. This team was composed of French Mafia Corsicans led by Lucien Sarti, who performed the final, fatal shooting. Christian David may have been part of this team. A third team, French OAS terrorists, was in Dallas at the time of the shooting. It was a backup team in case the Dealey Plaza operation had to be aborted. It also served the purpose of providing false leads if it were not otherwise utilized. One of these terrorists, Jean Souetre, met with CIA’s E. Howard Hunt in Madrid and with General Edwin Walker in Dallas in the spring of 1963. He also met in New Orleans with anti-Castro Cubans in an assassination training camp during that same period. This operation was headquartered in Guy Banister’s office in New Orleans, which was frequented by Oswald. This was during the same time span that the meetings between Vidal, Hargraves, Colonel Bishop, and the Texas right-wing leaders occurred. H. L. Hunt and General Willoughby were leaders in a worldwide, extreme right-wing network linked with the John Birch Society and the Minutemen in the United States, and therefore also had access to the European assassins. H. L. Hunt, with Willoughby, sponsored even more radical spin-off groups from the Minutemen, and terrorist groups in Europe, including the French OAS that was linked to CIA-front corporation Permindex in Italy. A CIA document shows that Jean Souetre, or someone using his name, was in Dallas on the day of the assassination, and left Dallas or Fort Worth 48 hours after the assassination. Others who were either in the plot or on the fringes also belonged to extreme right-wing organizations: Guy Banister and David Ferrie were members of the Minutemen; Clay Shaw was active in right-wing activities and was on the board of directors of Permindex. Both Ferrie and Shaw were CIA agents. Key people in the Secret Service were brought into the plot. Their role was one of omission—to minimize the protection of the president during his Dallas trip and to participate passively in the cover- up. The Warren Commission was not part of the conspiracy, but its members either went along with the cover-up or were duped by Johnson and Hoover. Although Oswald might have been part of the plot (wittingly or unwittingly), he was a fall guy. He was set up by the conspirators, who knew that he had CIA and FBI connections, and that the hierarchy of these agencies instinctively would contain the investigation to cover themselves. The preponderance of available evidence (we do not have all the evidence) is not sufficient to implicate the CIA, directed from the top, in master-planning the crime or ordering its execution. However, the evidence does indicate that some of its midranking officers were involved in the assassination. These officers included William K. Harvey, David Atlee Phillips, and David Sanchez Morales. Both Harvey and Morales had become very closely associated with Mafioso Johnny Rosselli, who was assigned to the CIA in the plots to kill Fidel Castro."},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"The cumulative evidence that Harvey, Morales, and Phillips were a trio who planned and oversaw the assassination is very persuasive. Harvey’s notes on assassinations are an exact blueprint of the JFK assassination—including the use of French Corsicans as the shooters, and the use of disinformation schemes to blame the Communists. Harvey detested Robert Kennedy for having removed him from his power base in the CIA. Harvey had become personal friends with Mafia leaders, and, according to a recently released HSCA document, was suspected by high-ranking CIA officer John Scelso of being the one who murdered Sam Giancana. By the time of the assassination, Harvey’s mental condition had deteriorated badly, and he was close to being a broken man with nothing to lose. David Phillips hated John Kennedy and had long been involved with David Morales in CIA assassination operations in South and Central America to overthrow governments. Phillips was the master of disinformation, and worked closely with Harvey and Morales in the plots to murder Castro. Phillips was CIA’s monitor of activities in the CIA-financed Cuban exile organizations DRE and Alpha 66—both linked to 30 November—and all three were Cuban exile groups that are prime suspects in the assassination. Phillips offered bribes through Cuban exile Antonio Veciana to get his cousins in the Cuban consulate to say that Oswald had been there in late September/early October 1963. Phillips had met with Oswald in Dallas in late August/early September 1963. David Morales told his close friends in Arizona of his assassination operations for the CIA in South America. Morales was enraged at President Kennedy for the Bay of Pigs failure. And, in a drunken diatribe, he implicitly admitted involvement in the assassination to his friends in Arizona when he said, “We took care of that son of a bitch, didn’t we?” Morales was involved with another prime suspect in the assassination, Rolando Masferrer, in attempts to overthrow the Castro government in the late 1950s. David Morales is the most likely candidate for managing the operations in Dallas. The key Mafia leaders in the plot were Carlos Marcello, Santo Trafficante Jr., Sam Giancana, Johnny Rosselli, and their partner, Jimmy Hoffa. Their primary roles were (1) recruit the French Corsican assassins, (2) distribute the money obtained from Jimmy Hoffa, and (3) provide some of the staffing at Dealey Plaza. The primary roles of the powerful Dallas right wing were (1) control Dallas officials, (2) bring Johnson and Hoover into the plot, and (3) provide additional money. The extreme right wing considered the eastern power structure, both Republicans and Democrats, to be no better than Communists selling out the nation to a one-world government through the United Nations. By participating in the murder of President Kennedy and replacing him with Lyndon Johnson, the extreme right wing in the Southeastern and Western United States struck a mortal blow to the reign of power of the Northeastern establishment that had been largely in control of government from the inception of the nation. There is no evidence of a single arch fiend behind the plot. It was an evil idea that hatched at a lower level; then grew to where it was given the go-ahead by the ultimate sponsors at a high level. The weight of the evidence indicates that the concept of the plot was designed by CIA’s mentally unstable William Harvey, working with the fascist-racist-paranoid General Charles Willoughby. Both had experience with the Mafia in assassination plots of political leaders. And Willoughby was on the payroll of H. L. Hunt, who had a private telephone line direct to J. Edgar Hoover. Harvey could have coordinated his planning with Willoughby through Colonel William Bishop in Dallas, who was part of Harvey’s ZR/RIFLE assassination program. Evidence of an elaborate scheme taking place in Mexico City in late September-early October 1963 shows that CIA operatives, probably working with individuals from Mexico’s national police (DFS) and Nicaraguan intelligence, laid down a scripted ruse wherein Oswald was portrayed as a Communist recruited by Cuban intelligence to assassinate Kennedy. The plan was intended to precipitate an invasion of Cuba by falsely setting up Castro as a sponsor of the assassination. The plan was quickly abandoned when Oswald was captured and the plot began to unravel, thereby"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"threatening exposure of the master conspirators. The lone-assassin myth was hastily substituted in its place. This proved to be impossible to sustain because it was transparently false. The only way that the plotters went scot-free was through the prodigious efforts of Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover, assisted in the cover-up by CIA ex-director Allen Dulles and CIA counter-intelligence chief James Angleton. The roles of Oswald, Clay Shaw, Guy Banister, and David Ferrie in New Orleans began as a counter-intelligence scheme by the FBI and/or the CIA under the direction of David Atlee Phillips, to discredit the Fair Play for Cuba Committee; but along the way this scheme was converted to a cover story for the assassination. There is no evidence yet available that links the Joint Chiefs of Staff or any of its members to the plot or the cover-up. There is no evidence yet available that the military industrial complex or a world-wide high cabal were the originators of the plot. *** The assassination of John Kennedy was a phenomenon spawned out of a complex of people and circumstances, unique in U.S. history, in which Kennedy’s enemies joined together in a spontaneous swell of personal fear, paranoia, and jealousy generated by the Kennedy brothers’ precipitous actions; and by the Kennedys’ aura of invincibility, arrogance, and elitism. The enemies of the Kennedys came to obsessively loathe them and to believe that the only way to protect themselves and stop the Kennedy dynasty was by assassination. Many of Kennedy’s ideological enemies genuinely (but mistakenly) believed that the Kennedys were going to destroy the nation with their perceived ineptitude, weakness, appeasement of communism, dismantling the military-industrial complex, and liberal policies concerning race. The Kennedys may have helped bring on the assassination by their own duplicity, hardball politics, and reckless, self-serving behavior, which was perceived as jeopardizing national security. Their behavior provided a rationalization for the plotters to get rid of the Kennedys “for the good of the country.” Nonetheless, the Kennedys’ larger goals for the nation were admirable and their faults were mild compared to those of the conspirators. It can be persuasively argued that if the Kennedys had succeeded in ridding the nation of organized crime, dumping Lyndon Johnson, taming the extremists, stopping the cold war, and retiring J. Edgar Hoover, the United States would not have the legacy of gigantic problems that we have today. The “power elite” in the United States, consisting of the liberal and conservative establishment, were willing to look the other way because of their own economic interests. No one wanted the crisis that would have erupted had the truth been revealed at the time of the assassination. It would very likely have had a devastating impact on political stability and economic interests. The truth would have shattered the nation, possibly with an irreparable constitutional breakdown. For these reasons there was a perfect atmosphere for a cover-up. The news media and intelligencia were willing to go along with established authority, as was their accustomed role at that time. Denial of the full truth persists to this day: many members of the government, the major news media, and prominent historians still are unwilling to admit that they were taken in by Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover. A vital lesson to be learned is that the structure of the United States government could not cope with an assassination that simultaneously involved: (a) a corrupt, ruthless, manipulative vice president who wanted desperately to become"},{"pageNumber":621,"pageContent":"president; (b) a corrupt, ruthless, all-powerful director of the FBI who had compromising files on many of the leaders of the nation; (c) a power elite that was willing to look the other way; (d) a hapless congress that rolled over to the control of Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover; (e) a sycophantic news media willing to be manipulated by federal authorities; (f) the unprecedented ascent of power by organized crime because of a corrupted director of the FBI; and (g) the personal secrets of John and Robert Kennedy that an investigation would have exposed, thus compelling the Kennedy family to yield to the cover-up in their fear, shock, and grief. These elements combined to make the assassination feasible. Fortunately, most do not exist today. Over the years, corrections have been made in the government and the news media: Congress is a more vigilant watchdog; the news media is far more diversified and critical of power, thus making it more difficult to contain a major scandal. Today we do not have a monster heading the FBI with a lock on government officials by blackmail, or a vice president with the criminal genius of Lyndon Johnson. Manipulation of the public through fear of communism is gone. The concentrated power of organized crime has greatly diminished. The militant right wing, although still active, does not have the alliances with powerful politicians and wealthy industrialists that it had in 1963. And new presidents are not taking on all of the evils of the world at one seating. But troublesome questions remain: Would Congress have the courage to assert its constitutional power to deal with an assassination by a military-political junta killing both the president and vice president simultaneously? Could the nation drift again into the grip of evil extremists? Is the present rise of militant extremism—and the demonizing of the president—a shadow of an eerie repetition of 1963? The assassination of John F. Kennedy can properly be described as an immense national disgrace that revealed the incapacity of our Congress to confront and expose a coup d’état within the executive branch. The harm done to the nation, although not irreparable, has been enormous. November 22, 1963 marked the beginning of a decline in the fundamental strength of our economy, the beginning of an inexorable erosion of law and order, and a diminution of our sense of pride and confidence as a nation. The Kennedy assassination was the consequence of a national disorder of venality, deception, and hatred that had infected the nation long before 1963. It does seem now, however, that our nation is healing and regaining strength as we approach the new century. Remarkably, we seem to have survived. Our nation’s recovery from the disaster is a tribute to the resiliency and adaptability of the American people. But, if there is another coup d’état, God help us. Only by the U.S. Government somehow exposing the full and undiluted truth of the assassination, and then building into the law and the Constitution permanent safeguards against usurpation of constitutional power by murder and cover-up within the government, can we have any comfort that another coup d’état will not occur. This will require a great effort by our most honorable and wisest constitutional/governmental scholars, supported by the president, the Congress, and the Supreme Court. The task will be daunting, but a determined, long-term effort should be made.

Look at the development [pointing to the complex of tall buildings]. The Trade Mart was the only thing out that way other than hospitals. We had two smokestacks. I don’t know what happened to them. But all this massive stuff was nonexistent. It’s like I told you. Jesse Kellam [manager of the Johnson-owned Austin television station KTBC] told me that Jack Puterbaugh...have you ever heard the name? He was in the Agricultural Department with Billie Sol Estes with Orville Freeman. Jesse told me that Puterbaugh came into town and changed the motorcade route. You see, I have no way of knowing; I’m just telling you what was told to me. Earlier I told you they could have turned on Elm Street rather than Main Street; they would then have a direct route, right down Elm Street, could hit the freeway over here [pointing] and be at the Trade Mart. But they came down Main Street and made that turn, you could tell it was an ambush, a total ambush. Twyman: A perfect crossfire position. All angles. There were bushes (there still are, hidden over there; and also behind the picket fence), and shots could have been fired from the Dal-Tex Building and the County Records Building. M. Brown: When you think of where the shooters were, you can easily see now....Did you read the book, Texas Connection ? I know the guy that wrote it . Twyman: Yes, Zirbel. M. Brown: I was trying to think of it this morning. Zirbel. Twyman: And I’ve also done a lot of reading on Billie Sol Estes, and you’ve got a big piece in your book [735] on him. You know it’s so disturbing, this recent thing that’s come out about all these people that Billie Sol claims Lyndon had killed. I thought, oh, no! I don’t even want to see this, because it’s so fantastic, so far out."},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":" M. Brown: Well, Clint Peoples [736] was a dear friend of mine. I called Clint on a Friday. He was in his early eighties. I said, Clint, a friend of mine and I are working on this movie. (Of course, it never materialized.) I said we would like to put you on a camcorder, interview you, and talk about things that we know. This was Friday. I told him I would see him next Friday... he was a big tease. I said, “I’ll tell you what I’ll do, Clint. I’ll buy your lunch and you can be a kept man.” So anyway, on Tuesday, I turned the television on and he had been in an accident and died. And I’m telling you, the cold chills went all over me. Twyman: What year was this? M. Brown: Oh, gosh, things run together. This is ’96. I would like to believe that it was about ’92 or ’93. ...Well, what lay people don’t know is that our government basically made a turnover in 1963. Twyman: Yes, it was a coup d’etat. M. Brown: The lay people, they have no idea. Twyman: A lot of people don’t want to believe it. It’s just too disturbing to them. I noticed Hunt being a bigamist. But didn’t he have three wives at the same time? M. Brown: He sure did. The first wife died. Twyman: But at one time there were actually three living at the same time? He made his own set of rules. M. Brown: It’s just like the day that I got out of my car, and we parked in the same parking lot. And if you saw him you’d never be able to identify him as a rich man. He drove jalopy cars. Anyway, it was several days before the assassination. He said, “C’mere honey, I’ve got something for you. You’ve seen that Wanted for Treason poster? He had a whole stack of them. And he said, “I want to give you one.” Well at that time I was young, I was naive, and I looked and said, “Hey! You can’t do the president that way!” I said, “My God, you’ll get in trouble!” He said, “Not me . I’m the richest man in the world, and no one will touch me.” They didn’t. They haven’t. Twyman: Did you know Bunker Hunt? Did you ever suspect him? M. Brown: A lot of people have asked me, and I said, well, H. L. Hunt ran his own show. I feel like it was his choice, his solution. You see, in 1960, in the Kennedy-Johnson campaign, I was told that H. L. Hunt and Joe Kennedy met in California and stayed behind closed doors a day or two. Lots of money was exchanged. The old man Kennedy was with the Mafia. You know that—Joe Kennedy? So they made a pact that John Kennedy would go on the ballot and Lyndon would take the second position. And Hunt told him, “You may win this battle, but we will win the war.” Joe Kennedy later had a stroke. He went out of commission completely. As for H. L. Hunt, what was happening? President Kennedy was fixing for a lot of people, costing a lot of money here in Texas. Money, and power, and oil. They didn’t want anyone to have a part of it. So Hunt told Lyndon, who they manipulated—he was manipulated all the time he was in Washington, I mean totally manipulated—that he had to do something. By the same token Lyndon Johnson was in deep trouble—Billie Sol Estes, Bobby Baker—so there wasn’t much choice at the time but to eradicate Kennedy. And then it all stopped. Everything stopped. Twyman: The investigation, yes. J. Edgar Hoover was in deep trouble too. M. Brown: Yes. Kennedy was trying to force him out of office. But it all stopped. You know, if you have any imagination or intelligence, it’s easy to see what happened. Twyman: I guess you know that H. L. Hunt had connections all over the world, capabilities. He"},{"pageNumber":624,"pageContent":"could make almost anything happen that he wanted to. Did you ever hear much talk about that? M. Brown: Oh, yes. We knew he was the king of the roost. There was no question. And Clint Murchison and, of course, Sid Richardson [had died before the assassination]. Those three men, they were the controllers. It’s sad, but it’s true. Twyman: And all three of them, including LBJ, had very close ties to Hoover. M. Brown: Oh, yes. You see, Clint Murchison...his family was wealthy. They owned things. But when he married, he married a woman out of Tyler, Texas. I’d like to believe her last name was White, but it’s been so long. And the White family was close to President Taft, and J. Edgar Hoover at the time he was starting in, all of them. And this is where Clint Murchison met the big speaker of Texas [Sam Rayburn]. And we had Roosevelt, and Roosevelt used to come to Texas all the time. I don’t know that he hunted, per se, but they would drive him around and they would hunt. They loved to hunt big. But they had the connections of Roosevelt. And then we had the Great Depression, you remember the Great Depression? Jesse Jones from Houston wrote the program or whatever it was to get our country out of the Great Depression. I don’t know whether you know it, but it’s Texas history. He owned the Houston Chronicle and the Lamar Hotel. He was rich. But again these people intertwined. They were wealthy, powerful, and together. Twyman: I am developing the idea that the Texas right wingers down here began to hate the Eastern establishment. That was the Eastern High Cabal (let’s call it that) that ran things. Guys that went to Harvard, Yale. People at the CIA and the State Department. And big oil. The big old oil, Standard Oil, and those. And then out here you have these wildcatters and renegades in Texas who became personally very wealthy. And they formed an antipathy toward this Eastern bunch. Now this may have occurred after Roosevelt. It probably started coming on after Roosevelt. But one of my theories is that in killing Kennedy they accomplished many things. They accomplished, first of all, striking a mortal blow to that Eastern establishment.... [And I meant to add, the CIA liberal factions that included Allen Dulles.] M. Brown: It kept Lyndon Johnson from being indicted. Twyman: It kept him from being indicted; and it kept Hoover in power. And it reversed the trend that Kennedy was bringing on about getting out of Vietnam, disarmament, making peace with the Soviets. And they basically started running the country not from New York and Harvard and Yale but from down here—Texas. The University of Texas instead of Harvard. M. Brown: Right. Twyman: And then, not only that, they were able, by utilizing their friends in the CIA (we’ll call them rogue friends there, extreme anti-Communist types), to box in the CIA to where Allen Dulles and that group couldn’t do a thing after the assassination. This is my general theory that I’m developing. But I did notice in your book that you mention the party at Clint Murchison’s home, the night before the assassination, with John J. McCloy at that party. But he was part of the Eastern establishment. M. Brown: He [McCloy] also put the money deals together for Murchison and Hunt, I mean the financials. He put those plans together. Twyman: So he played both sides. M. Brown: Yep. Twyman: Eastern and Western. M. Brown: I’ve been asking about him because I was one of the first, I guess, to say that John McCloy was close to these people. "},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"Twyman: Yes, I never made that connection. But now that you mention it, I think I have read about it. Did you know General Willoughby? Charles Willoughby? M. Brown: I met him. He was with General MacArthur. Is that him? Twyman: Yes, he was General MacArthur’s chief of intelligence. He presumably worked for Hunt. M. Brown: Yes he did. Twyman: He was a bad character. M. Brown: I think they all were bad. I do. I really do. Maybe they didn’t intend to be bad. They were kind of like on a carousel and they couldn’t get off . Twyman: That’s a good way to put it. And they thought they were absolutely right. M. Brown: Right. See, I did not know until Connie started interviewing me and everything. But my first thought, Fred Florence, of Republican National Bank, he was a White Russian, in charge of the White Russian community. It just blew my mind. Twyman: Was he an immigrant? M. Brown: Well, I think they said he was born here in Texas but it was his family who were immigrants. Twyman: There was a community of White Russians here. And they were very anti-Communist. Now who’s to say they were wrong? In their minds they were right. And Willoughby was really an extreme anti-Communist. You knew of General Walker, of course? M. Brown: Yes. I thought he was strange. Twyman: Well, he was, and he was gay, you know. I didn’t know that until a year ago. Did you know that? M. Brown: I had heard that. Was that what messed him up in the military? Twyman: Yes, and he started distributing John Birch Society literature, and Bobby Kennedy got him out of it—ran him off. But I didn’t realize that he was very much a homosexual. And what about Sid Richardson being homosexual? M. Brown: Let me tell you. Sid Richardson and the senator who served on the Warren Commission. What was his name, Russell?...never had married. They would all get together and go down here to Matagorda Bay off the coast of Texas, have parties. There you go. In those years they were closet people to the public. Twyman: Yes, and Hoover? M. Brown: And Hoover. Yes, he’d come down. Twyman: I heard Gordon McClendon, too. But I don’t think H. L. Hunt, nor Lyndon. M. Brown: Oh, no [laughs].... No. Maybe for the fine and country boy...no. I don’t think so. Twyman: I wanted to ask you, when Lyndon made this statement to you to the effect that after tomorrow the Kennedys are not going to embarrass me anymore, humiliate me anymore. Tell me about that, when it happened, and where it happened. M. Brown: Well, we were at the party out there at Clint Murchison’s. And I certainly was not expecting him to be there. No one had said Lyndon would be there, okay?"},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":" Twyman: Oh, you didn’t know that Lyndon was going to be there? M. Brown: Not at the party. And it was kind of late. Of course he had to come from Houston. But that’s an easy thing. Even in 1963 you can get to Houston in an hour by flying. But when he came in, a pin could have dropped and you’d have heard it. I mean it startled the people. And immediately they went all behind closed doors. And they weren’t in there long. And I didn’t know whether I should leave; the party was almost breaking up. You know it’s a strange feeling. And when Lyndon came out he was ruddy, mad, angered—you could see it. And I thought he was going to kiss me on the cheek or something. But he didn’t do that. This is when he said they would never embarrass him again, that was on Thursday night [November 21, 1963]. Twyman: The night before the assassination. Now, was that the party when McCloy and Nixon were there, and Hoover? M. Brown: Yes. Twyman: Any military people? M. Brown: Some that I probably didn’t know. The thing being that all of them came into Texas on Tuesday for a big Pepsi Cola convention. And then Clint’s secretary called and said drop by, we’ll have a hell of a time. High living and everything. I really thought, because Clint adored Hoover, or Edgar they called him in those days, I thought it was a party. “Hey, we’re glad you’re here.” You know. That sort of thing. It was a strange place. It really was. Lyndon came in on Tuesday. He met Kennedy in San Antonio on Wednesday. And they went to Houston on Thursday. And this happened Thursday. Twyman: This was Clint Murchison’s new, big home? M. Brown: It was an awful, big, big place. Twyman: Now when Lyndon had this outburst, after the assassination, when you challenged him, tell me about that. M. Brown: Well, everyone in Dallas—it was general gossip in the business group—that Lyndon was responsible. And having such warm feelings for him, I thought, “God, how could he be involved?” I didn’t want to believe it. So I said, “Now Lyndon, you’ve got to tell me. You’ve got to talk to me. Are you —were you—involved with Kennedy’s death?” And when I asked him that—anger—he would explode at the drop of a hat. He screamed and hollered, and I was really frightened because he had told me many years before that you don’t see, hear, or repeat anything. And I thought I’ve really made a bad mistake. But finally he said, “You know the people that I know,” talking about the oil people and intelligence. “They did it.” And when he said that he went into the bathroom and he almost knocked the hinges off the door. He was strong, you know. I’ll tell you, the cold chills went up and down my spine. I didn’t know what to believe. The people I knew were responsible. Well, anyway, needless to say, I was so ill I was sick to my stomach over all of it. Twyman: One account I read of this was that this was at a New Year’s Eve party. M. Brown: Yes. At the Driskill Hotel. But it wasn’t at a party. He and I were alone in his suite there at the Driskill. There were parties going on. But I met him in his suite at the Driskill Hotel. I was so glad to see him, because it was the first time that I had seen him since he became president. But all these other things were all down in my heart, you know, all that stuff.... Twyman: Now, about this letter that Billie Sol Estes’ lawyer [737] wrote naming all these people [that Lyndon had ordered to be murdered].... That is the most incredible thing I could possibly imagine! I don’t even want to have it in my book. No one will believe it."},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":" M. Brown: It’s true. Pick up the phone and call Caddy [Billie Sol Estes’ attorney, Douglas Caddy]. Twyman: Call Caddy? M. Brown: Call him. He’ll talk to you. The first time I saw him or heard about this, I thought it doesn’t exist...in my mind. I had to find out.... And, again, I promise you, if things got in Lyndon Johnson’s way, or if something he didn’t believe in, he didn’t have a problem of getting rid of it at all. Twyman: You know the deeper I dig into this whole thing the more incredible it gets. It’s beyond.... M. Brown: ...the human mind. Twyman: Yes. Now I find it really difficult to believe that this Malcolm Wallace did the shooting at Dealey Plaza. M. Brown: Oh, I don’t. Oh, no! It’s easy to if you know Malcolm. See, I met Wallace way back. This John Kinser he killed? Are you familiar with that story? Twyman: Yes, the golf pro. M. Brown: Golf pro. He taught me almost everything I know about golf. Twyman: Do you play golf? M. Brown: I did. I don’t any more. This Mac Wallace, he was an activist, okay? And I’ve seen him shoot at skeet and trap. Years ago I used to be real outgoing. I was at the Dallas gun club about three days before the assassination. And I said, “Hi, Mac, what’cha doing out here? Are you doin’ a little practicing?” You know. And the minute all of this happened, my mind went to him immediately. Twyman: I’d think that if it were a military intelligence or CIA operation they wouldn’t have anybody near there doing shooting who could be linked right into Lyndon Johnson. They’d want to provide Lyndon with complete deniability. But, of course, maybe this whole thing is a lot simpler than one thinks. But there’s all this evidence of military intelligence. Mexico City, the Oswald impersonators, the Walker shooting attempt—all of these things are described. They speak to a covert action, military, or CIA type. That’s the reason why I’d think they wouldn’t have Wallace there unless they wanted to.... [I meant to add, link LBJ inextricably into the plot as part of an agreement.] M. Brown: You see, Wallace was an agricultural department man. Puterbaugh was an agricultural man. Billie Sol Estes, an agricultural man. You put all these ingredients together—you have to know who these people are and the position they played, to understand. Now I do think probably there were two plots. I think the military definitely was there. I really do. But then Lyndon Johnson had his own little team. Twyman: Really? M. Brown: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You see, Mac Wallace met with an untimely death down in Houston, Texas. Are you familiar with that? It was a Texas murder. Ran off the road. And the thing that really got to me—of course, Mac Wallace and Billie Sol were very close together—the car was picked up and sent to Houston and mashed (you know, torn up) without any investigation. Billie Sol was the first to know. Billie Sol calls me and he said, “Hey, did you hear about old Mac?” I said no, what about him? “He got wasted.” Twyman: Do you ever wonder why you’re still around? M. Brown: Well, there have been things in my life. After I first went public, something happened"},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"to me. I was going across the toll way here in Dallas, and the exhaust system of my car was blown completely off. I still just shudder. Twyman: And how was it blown off? M. Brown: It was a pipe bomb to the exhaust system. And so when they investigated, they said you are a lucky, lucky girl. And boy I knew. Twyman: Is that in the Dallas police records? M. Brown: I don’t know. But that doesn’t mean anything was ever documented. My maid that I had for ten years disappeared. I went down to the police department; in those years a black didn’t mean anything in Dallas. Not worth the paper it was written on. But I still worry about her. You know, what did happen to her? Billie Sol just said, “Mac Wallace did her first—and you’re not very smart.” And when he said that, I thought, well, how dumb can I be? And really—maybe my ego—I would like to think that I was something to Lyndon. That really down deep in his heart he had some kind of feelings for me. And that may be another reason I survived. I may be a real naive woman, but I would like to believe that. I know the last time I saw him, and we talked. He said at that time if things had been different, if he hadn’t been a political figure, you know, things would have been different. But he would never go public about Steven [Madeleine’s son by Lyndon]. Twyman: What about Jack Ruby? M. Brown: Knew him well. Real well. Anyone that worked downtown Dallas—from the police department down to the Carousel Club—knew Jack Ruby. Because if they didn’t, I’m here to tell you they’re lying. He walked up and down Commerce every day. And if he didn’t know you on the street (I still have my Carousel card), he’d jump up and say, “Hey, Clancy,” he’d say; I mean he’d look him over. “If you come down to the Carousel Club, the drinks are on me.” So when Henry Wade said he didn’t know Jack Ruby, and some of the others, I say they’re lying. Twyman: Suddenly no one in town knew him. M. Brown: Everyone knew Jack.... Twyman: Did you ever know of or hear if LBJ had any connections to Oswald? M. Brown: No. But Jack Ruby was with Lee Harvey Oswald. Twyman: In what way? M. Brown: Well, I saw Lee Harvey Oswald in the Carousel Club. Take in mind there wasn’t a lot of entertainment in Dallas. And so it wouldn’t be any trouble to go down to Jack’s, buy some drinks, smoke a Camel, play cards, or anything. And the entertainment was pretty good.... Twyman: My book can put your story in context. I’m interviewing Gerry Patrick Hemming, and he’s got an incredible story. He told me that he’d come out here to Dallas, talked with the Hunts, and was later offered a contract to kill Kennedy. He had a group of guerrilla warfare people down in No Name Key, Florida, training assassination squads. M. Brown: Now that happened. Hunt used to laugh about it. He said if I don’t have enough money to get what I want, I’ve got a squad that can take care of it. Twyman: He said that? M. Brown: Oh, yes. He sure did. This guy was unbelievable.... Twyman: Have you read the book Texas Rich by Harry Hurt III? You should read that. M. Brown: Is it good?"},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":" Twyman: It’s a very authoritative book. A little book. He talks about Hunt’s gambling. Hunt was an expert gambler. M. Brown: I’m telling you this happened. We’d sat here and we’d all had a deck of cards. That sucker could almost tell you verbatim what you had. He had some kind of sense. Twyman: You’re confirming some of what’s in Texas Rich. Hurt wrote that Hunt could just spread out cards, fold them up, and he could tell you every card that was there. A very bright guy. M. Brown: I’m going to tell you, we were told immediately, of course, all of us thought it had something to do with this, in our minds—that he had gone on a sabbatical to Mexico right after the assassination. When in fact he went to be with Lyndon. I think they were in Washington. He was gone three weeks. He came back the cockiest person you ever saw in your life. The oil depletion problem was over, and he had won the war . He was one character. I miss him. But I was so afraid. I was maybe paranoid then. I would wait to make sure he wasn’t on the street. Or if I went first to the parking lot I practically ran to my car to keep from seeing him. I was afraid. He wouldn’t tip. He wouldn’t do anything. I mean where it cost him money. I always wanted my car, so I tipped the guy. But they’d see me and, boy, here my car would come. One day he said, “Is it 'cause you’re a girl, that you get your car first?” I said, well that’s brownie points. Twyman: You might have said, “Also I tip.” Did you ever hear anything about General LeMay...Curtis LeMay? M. Brown: Not really. Twyman: Let me think of some more names. A man named Jack Crichton? M. Brown: Yes, I heard of him. This John Birch Society is going strong here in town. And I have a friend who is a member of it. Twyman: Is it still going strong? M. Brown: Oh, yes. The John Birchers. I forgot when they meet. I think they meet on a Tuesday.... I told Dick Russell when he called me, I said I can still see the old man picking up the phone and calling Jack Ruby. If you wanted to waste someone in Dallas, all you had to do if you knew the right people— $100 get him wasted, $50 get the hell beat out of him, whatever. And I can still see the old man calling Jack, saying we don’t want that man down there in the city jail. And that’s what happened to Lee Harvey Oswald. Jack thought he’d rake in the money. He stood in with the police department. He thought that they would never arrest him. I know about Jack; but it backfired. The day, I think it was a couple weeks prior to the time the map was published about the motorcade, we were at Jack Ruby’s [Carousel Club] and we were playing cards. And he waltzed over to the table and said, “Hey, guys.” You know, I liked him. So he pulled out a piece of paper and he said, “Do you know what this is?” And I glanced up and said what is it? He said, “It’s a map”—he called JFK an ugly name—“of when he comes to Dallas.” Twyman: Ruby didn’t like Kennedy then? M. Brown: No one did. I said, “Oh, Jack, we know you know everything going on in Dallas.” But it hit me. Why did he have something that was pretty sacred information, to me, about the president’s route? Twyman: Do you remember how many days this was before the parade route was made public?"},{"pageNumber":630,"pageContent":" M. Brown: It seemed like it was maybe two weeks. Twyman: It was made public in the paper, I think, only four days before the assassination. M. Brown: Yes, it later came out. But Jack Ruby had it. I know. We always talked about my business. He knew all about me, my acquaintances, and everything. I said, “Jack Ruby has a map of when Kennedy comes to Dallas?” Later I told my son about the map and he said, “Mother, Kennedy doesn’t want to come to Dallas.” I didn’t watch the news a lot then. And I said, “What makes you think that?” And he said, “You know this is not a good place right now.” He said, “Oh, mother, it’s ugly.” He was not quite thirteen. And I said, “Well, I hope everything is going to be all right.” But seeing Jack Ruby hold that map, it left a mark in my mind. Twyman: This Department of Agriculture thing you talked about strikes a bell. I interviewed Gerry Patrick Hemming and he said that some of the people that ran the JFK assassination were out of the Department of Agriculture. Now isn’t that a coincidence? After what you have told me? That Hemming also named one of the people from there. And I thought what’s the Department of Agriculture doing with this kind of capability to set up an assassination team and murder the president? But now you tell me there was Malcolm Wallace and a lot of other people in the Department of Agriculture who seem to have been involved. M. Brown: All of them. Twyman: The Department of Agriculture was in jeopardy too? M. Brown: Oh, big time. Yeah. Yeah. The thing is, Henry Marshall was a good man. And he had intended to go public with his information. He never had the opportunity. I’ll tell you something that in one way I’m proud of. Talks about Henry Marshall’s death. Bill Bank, the attorney that represented the Marshall family in getting this overturned, the suicide to murder, went to school with my son that died. He went to Texas A&M with Steven and he helped overturn the case from suicide to murder. Bill sure did. Twyman: I’ve got that story, I think, pretty clear. But I’m really in doubt about introducing this long list of murders ordered by LBJ. For one thing I want to finish my book. And I’d have to do so much more work to put that in. M. Brown: I think it should be. Oh, yes, I think so. I think the public needs to know every one of these details, I do. Twyman: Do you think Billie Sol would talk with me? M. Brown: He might. Do you have his phone? Twyman: I have his phone number, yes. M. Brown: He’ll talk to you. If you have that number in Brady, he’ll probably answer the phone and call me. Twyman: Supposedly there is some evidence to back this up? M. Brown: He says so. Twyman: Let me go on down my list. Okay, you having been, as you say, LBJ’s “sideline,” and this guy, Ragsdale, was the intermediary. M. Brown: Yes, he was the attorney that took care of all the legal things. And he and Cliff Carter grew up in Smithville, Texas, together. But I know that the Ragsdale family in Smithville and the Carter family were big names. Twyman: We understand that. M. Brown: Yes. And Clint Murchison and Sid Richardson are buried close together. Isn’t that"},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"strange? Twyman: Now I’ve read that there’s really no doubt, for most people who know anything about it, that you and LBJ actually were close? Is there a documentation trail on that? M. Brown: The only thing is I had the letter that was left that I met with Jesse Kellam in Houston and Jerome Ragsdale. Jerome Ragsdale wrote it to assure me that my funds would continue to take care of Steven. Twyman: Have they continued? M. Brown: No, they were stopped in ’75. And I’ve always thought that Jesse Kellam and Ragsdale went to splitting the money. I felt like I got shafted. Twyman: So LBJ died in ’73. M. Brown: ’73. Twyman: So two years later the money stopped. M. Brown: Jesse said, well you know how this probate court stuff is. And it’s going to take some time to get things worked out. What was I to do? Twyman: Of course, there must be hundreds of witnesses who saw the two of you [Madeleine and Lyndon] together over the years. M. Brown: Oh, yes. And then, I think Kellam died maybe in the fall. And then Jerome. They got real close together. Well, when we went to the Murchison Bank Building to get all the legal documents that I had put in the safe deposit box, it had been drilled from the wall. There was no sign of a safe deposit box. I think I may still have the key, I don’t know.... Twyman: Really? M. Brown: What does that tell you of power? They can do anything they want to do. Twyman: That’s why they fight for it so hard, isn’t it? M. Brown: Yes. Kill. It’s sad but it’s true. Twyman: [continuing list of names] Currington M. Brown: John Currington. Well, he was HL’s right-hand man. Twyman: You knew him? M. Brown: Oh, yes. Sure do. I knew Paul Rothermal. You knew Paul Rothermal? Twyman: I’ve quoted him from Dick Russell. M. Brown: Paul had bypass surgery. I haven’t talked to him.... He and Johnny Currington will tell you practically right up front that H. L. Hunt’s money paid for Kennedy’s assassination. That’s why when John told me about Martin Luther King, I said, “John, give me a break.” I guess I hate to believe these people. And he pulled out those checks, and my eyes almost fell out of my head. He had a suitcase full of documents and checks. Twyman: Yes, you have some samples of them in your book. Currington says those went to some secret escrow account? M. Brown: That’s how he did it.

Twyman: Have you read William Pepper’s new book? M. Brown: No, I haven’t. Twyman: He interviewed Currington, and Currington talks about Hunt and Hoover meeting, I think it’s in Chicago. And Hoover tells Hunt, “Well, this Martin Luther King, we’ve got to have a final solution, or to that effect.” M. Brown: I believe that. Twyman: And H. L. said, “Look, I think I can get rid of him just through my Life Line program.” And Hoover said, “No, we’ve got to have a complete solution.” About six weeks later it’s over. M. Brown: I’m going way back. I don’t recall the year. But Jesse Jackson and Martin Luther King, they were going to try to speak at SMU.... Twyman: Jesse Jackson? M.

Of course, when I went into those hotels, my name wasn’t used. It was either Jesse Kellam or Jerome Ragsdale. You know, they didn’t leave tracks. Twyman: I remember seeing a picture of Lyndon shortly before he died. His hair had gotten long like a hippy and gray. He just looked awful. M. Brown: He did. Twyman: He was still a young man, you know. M. Brown: Well, he was only sixty-three or sixty-four. He died when he had just turned sixty-four. His birthday is August the 27th. Twyman: But he had the heart problems before. M. Brown: Oh, yes. He had a bad, bad heart attack in ’68. Twyman: I’ve written about him as a tragedy as a person.

She called a week later and said that it was correct, except for two spellings of names which she corrected. I regret that I must end this book without further investigation of the Billie Sol Estes allegations, or the Department of Agriculture (DOA) connection. A thorough investigation of these areas might prove to be very fruitful in getting to the bottom of the complete story. I didn’t call Douglas Caddy or Billie Sol Estes. I was afraid of opening up another Pandora’s box. If proven to be true, particularly the part about Malcolm Wallace being one of the shooters at Dealey Plaza, it would implicate Lyndon Johnson more deeply into the assassination than I can place him with the material and time now at my disposal. But I don’t think that it would change my conclusions as to the structure of the plot. It would just move Lyndon Johnson further into the inner group, and perhaps enhance Gerry Patrick Hemming’s contention that Larry LaBorde and the DOA were involved. Hemming told me that the DOA was a repository for CIA agents, which makes sense to me. The DOA—a perfect cover for secret agents—had people all over the world doing agricultural and weather studies and the like. And Billie Sol Estes, Malcolm Wallace, and Henry Marshall were DOA. That subject is for one more book.

The problem that the Dallas police had was that the third empty casing had an inward dent in its mouth which made it questionable evidence of having fired a bullet projectile. Thus the Dallas police (their story goes) set aside the dented casing for further study; and the photographs showing only two empty cartridges were given to the FBI. This was later explained that the dented casing was held back “to be used for comparison tests.” A problem arose within a few days. When the Zapruder film was examined by the FBI, along with selected other forensic evidence, it became obvious there had to have been at least three shots fired; therefore, the Commission had to find three—not two; and not four either—empty shell casings, to make their case of a lone assassin, which, by this time had solidified into Oswald acting alone. It was thus decided to ignore the initial FBI exhibits and other documents showing only two empty casings and, instead, show all three as valid evidence of shots fired from the sniper’s nest. My purported mistake, actually an omission, was to ignore the dented casing in the belief that it was not valid evidence of a shot fired. And, at least initially, so did the FBI, the Dallas Police, and many others. Another criticism of Bloody Treason about the shell casing subject was my analysis of the photos showing cartridge cases on the sixth floor. My critics said I should have questioned the quality of the photos (instead of just using the term “appears to be.”) Admittedly, some details in the photos are questionable, although it seems quite obvious that at least one has been doctored. The best evidence , which I did cite, was two separate handwritten reports stating only two empty casings, signed by FBI agents J. Doyle Williams and Charles T. Brown, Jr. And, it should be noted, there is much belief on the part of serious researchers (including me) that all of the evidence against Oswald was planted. The accumulated evidence shows last minute scrambling in the FBI and the Warren Commission about the dented casing problem. The problem would not even begin to go away until the HSCA investigation, fourteen years later, in which test firings were conducted with the alleged Oswald rifle to see if the dent could have been caused by bolt action ejection of the cartridges in rapid firing. The results of these tests were reported in HSCA Volume 1, pages 452-458, to the effect that, one out of four test firings, with violent bolt action ejections of casings, produced a similar dent in one of them. Therefore, there was a possibility that the dented casing could have been authentic evidence of a third shot by Oswald. Reasonable doubt? You bet. In a jury trial, the judge could well have dismissed this out of hand. But, setting aside my considerable skepticism about the validity of the HSCA test (conducted by Washington D.C. Police Department) what does this do to my analysis in Bloody Treason ? Not much, I would say. First , the scrambling by the FBI, by the Warren Commission, and by President Johnson, to prove their case, reinforces the main thrust of my analysis, which is their willingness to meddle with and stretch, to extreme, the facts. Second , to this day there is solid evidence that there were six (or more) shots fired that struck Kennedy, Connally and other objects in Dealey Plaza that day. And there is a mountain of other forensic evidence to prove conspiracy. We really don’t need the empty cartridge evidence, although"},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"it is of value. Moreover, after reviewing all of the above, I believe that what I wrote on this subject presented the best evidence and the best conclusions. The Warren Commission report depended upon Arlen Specter’s ludicrous argument for a Single Bullet that caused JFK’s wounds and Connally’s wounds. This canard, I contend, helped them to suppress other forensic evidence to the contrary. A travesty of justice was thereby perpetrated. There is much more nuance and detail on this subject.

Before using this it should be checked against the tapes, where there is much more detail. [2009 Update: It should be noted that Roy Hargraves and Robert Hemming would occasionally step out of the meeting to call Gerry Hemming who presumably was in Florida, obviously trying to control the interview.] Roy now admits that he went from Miami to Dallas with Vidal on November 18, 1963 and returned to Miami on the afternoon/evening of November 22. They flew by private jet both ways. There were others, unnamed with them on the plane. Roy would not reveal who provided the plane. Roy would not say what he did in Dallas, or who he met there. Roy said that he did not shoot JFK, didn’t even know that JFK was to be in Dallas. [2009 Update:I couldn’t believe him—that he didn’t know JFK was in Dallas.] Roy also would not reveal where he stayed while in Dallas. Note: (Cliff Schoedl remembers Roy saying he stayed in a safe house. We need to check this.) At the end of the meeting when we were looking at photos of Dealey Plaza from Groden’s book of photos, Roy reiterated that Vidal was the man on Elm Street with the walkie talkie. I asked Roy if he was speculating on this. He said no, he was not speculating. He said compare Roy’s photo to the Saturday Evening Post photos. He explained that Vidal did not know what was coming down and was following specific instructions to do exactly specific things, thus explaining Vidal’s arms being raised up. [In the second meeting, Roy tried to recant that this man was Vidal. I suspect that this was Gerry at work in the telephone calls trying to control the interview.] Of great importance, Roy said it was Colonel William Bishop who ordered Vidal to come to Dallas at that time and that it was under Vidal’s instructions that Roy come along. Roy said that Colonel Bishop was Vidal’s case officer who gave him (and consequently Roy) the “green light” on all their raids in Cuba. Roy would not say who else were at meetings with Colonel Bishop, General Walker, Roy and Vidal, or who they met when they were in Dallas starting November 18, except to say that they were very"},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"dangerous people and no way will he reveal their names. (However, we still have Colonel Bishop’s statements to Gary Shaw implicating General Walker, the Hunt family and Willoughby in those meetings.) Roy showed us pictures of himself and others over the years. Robert will get copies for me. Roy said he had been at Grace Ranch near Tucson and that it was Joe Bonano’s ranch (RE: Chauncey Holt discussion). Roy strongly signaled that he was CIA/Mafia, same as Chauncey Holt. In discussions about General Walker shooting, Roy said Walker arranged it to make him look like a hero. Roy said Oswald had nothing to do with it. He blurted that he and Gerry Hemming were arguing over who would take the shot. Roy said later that if he met the torturer General Escalante he would kill him on the spot for what he did to Vidal.

[I had pressed Roy hard on this based on the remarkable similarity of Roy with Frenchy in photos.] Roy said that the photo in Bloody Treason of O’Hare was Colonel Bishop, no doubt about it. Said he “didn’t know who the other photo (on the top) was.” Roy is soon to be getting a spinal operation. (It could be very dangerous per Robert). [Note: Roy died shortly after the spinal operation]. Roy said “Black Dog Man” was there to signal the bomber (to blow up the car on the other side of the underpass.) Roy said he bombed Luis Balbuena’s house to give him a warning. This is a shift from before when he denied even knowing Balbuena. Roy said Gerry drove the getaway car in the LA Operation Chaos bombings for LAPD counter- intelligence unit. Howard K. Davis is now in Miami; Roy said I should talk with him. [He said that the green Nash Rambler had a lot of secrets.] When I asked Roy if I might get Ed Kolby to tell me if he and Ed Collins were on the plane to Dallas on November 18, he hesitatingly said they might.

Roy emphatically said it was not Ponce. Roy mentioned Dick Whatley, Bobbie Willis, and Jim Lewis as important figures to investigate. (See letter from Robert Hemming).

Wrone who believes in a conspiracy and, in fact, writes that a coup de’ etat took place. He writes, at length, that the Z-Film is authentic but he does not address, or even list or show Zapruder frames 302-303 and 316-317, which are shown and analyzed at length in Bloody Treason . And, he does not discuss or mention the part of my work about the Z-Film that was authenticated in consultations with the late Dr. Rod Ryan, a PhD in motion picture film technology, and academy award winner in that category. My work was also authenticated by Hollywood motion picture film technician, Leon Carrere, and Wrone doesn’t mention him. It gets worse. Wrone does not discuss or even mention Dr. David Mantik’s work about the alteration of the autopsy X-rays. And, he does not even mention Dr. John Costella’s work on the Z-Film or even list him in the index, although Wrone had access to this material at the time he wrote his book. It is not difficult for me to have sympathy with an author who has based a career on the authenticity of a piece of key evidence in an historical crime only to find in later years that he was mistaken. It is very hard to admit such a devastating mistake. And only human to go into denial and on the attack against the revealer of the mistake. One should guard against such instinctive responses. Let Mr. Wrone write a paper about frame 302-303 and 316-317, and about Dr. Mantik’s work, and Dr. Costella’s work, using scientific analysis to refute our conclusions and then let us all debate the subject. Until then, I won’t go further except to say that the remainder of his book, although worthy in some respects, is trivial or without consequence in his criticisms of others. "},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"APPENDIX F—The Z-Film at NPIC (National Photo Interpretation Center, a division of CIA) in Washington, D.C. As I was wrapping up the galleys of Bloody Treason in 1997, I didn’t know that an ARRB Senior Analyst by the name of Douglas P. Horne, with three other ARRB staff, was interviewing a retired NPIC manager, Homer McMahon about the Zapruder film. McMahon was the head of the NPIC color lab in 1963. He had an amazing story to tell to Doug Horne and his team: One or two days after the assassination, and before the John Kennedy funeral, a man who claimed to be a U.S. Secret Service agent by the name of Bill Smith arrived at NPIC and delivered to McMahon an amateur movie film of the assassination, the same type of film and specification as that in Zapruder’s camera—a double 8 Kodachrome II film (16mm width) unsplit. Bill Smith requested that 5” x 7” blow up prints be made of selected frames. This meeting and others are described in detail in reports about interviews with Hunter and McMahon, reproduced in the book Murder in Dealey Plaza . [738] All told, in the months of June, July and August, 1997, there were four meetings and two telephone call reports conducted by ARRB staff, all including Doug Horne, always accompanied by ARRB staff. In brief, McMahon said that he produced the required 5” x 7” prints (between 20 and 40 of them) some of which were mounted by others on briefing boards at NPIC and delivered first to John McCone at CIA and then to Lyndon Johnson at the White House. McMahon described the work as “an all night job” and said they were instructed by Bill Smith that this was top secret, and not to tell anyone, even their supervisor, about what they did. An important part of this story is that Bill Smith guided McMahon to select frames that would show three shots from behind from the Schoolbook Depository, which was what they wanted to see. He explained himself, “ You can’t fight City hall.” All but one of the foregoing statements by McMahon were confirmed by Ben Hunter (McMahon’s assistant who was present at the incident) in a separate interview of him by Doug Horne and ARRB staff. The one exception was a statement by McMahon who said that, in his opinion, President Kennedy was shot 6 to 8 times from three different locations, but that this was ultimately ignored. Most researchers of the autopsy and the Zapruder film have concluded that there were four shots that hit Kennedy, plus one to three that hit Connally—making a total of five to seven shots that hit occupants in the limousine. We must remember that this interview of McMahon was from his memory, thirty four years after the event. The important points here are that (a) he remembers seeing more than three shots that hit JFK, and even more important, (b) from three different directions, and (c) Bill Smith restricted NPIC to selecting only three shots from one direction. Further confirmation of both McMahon’s and Hunter’s stories was in a series of undated handwritten and typewritten notes in which some of the notes were identified by both of them as their handwriting. These notes were mostly a timing analysis of three shots at two shutter speeds (18 and 16 frames per second), in one case compared to that in Life Magazine . Apparently, NPIC was working on some of this after their initial overnight work before the funeral. The fact that a briefing board was delivered to LBJ is confirmed by Gus Russo in his book, Live by the Sword , from his interview of NPIC top photo analyst Dino Brugioni [739] on January 27, 1998. The night after the murder, the Secret Service brought over to the CIA a copy of an 8mm home"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"movie taken of the murder, the “Zapruder film.” Now, in another part of the CIA’s headquarters, the National Photographic Interpretation Center, the Agency’s top photo analyst, Dino Brugioni, watched in horror as the top of the president’s head exploded in a shower of crimson. Brugioni recently recalled: There were six or seven of us at the meeting. We were asked to time it, which was difficult because the camera was spring-loaded. We also developed still frames, which we enlarged and mounted on a large board which [Director] McCone took over to President Johnson... One more very important part of McMahon’s and Hunter’s story was that Bill Smith, when he arrived at NPIC, told them that he had just come down from Eastman Kodak in Rochester NY, where they had developed the film, and that he had obtained the film in Dallas in undeveloped condition from “the man who exposed the film.” When I first read this material I was a bit confused of the exact time line, specifically, how did Bill Smith get an undeveloped film in Dallas (witnesses in Dallas said that all three reversal copies and the original were developed in Dallas at Eastman Kodak there), fly to Kodak in Rochester, N.Y., have the film developed there, and get down to NPIC in Washington by either Saturday, November 23, or Sunday, November 24 (as the case may be) before the funeral and leave it with McMahon for enlarged photos? I decided to go to my time line in Exhibit 12-2A of Bloody Treason: November 22, 1963 12:30 pm: Abraham Zapruder films assassination; returns to his office in state of shock. About 2:00 pm: Secret Service agent Forrest Sorrels meets with Zapruder and requests copies of film. Source: W.C. Vol. VII, p. 352, testimony of Sorrels. No mention of Jamison Film. 12:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., approx.: Dallas police arrive at Zapruder’s office with shotguns. Zapruder refuses to give film to police; insists on government representative. Forrest Sorrels arrives at Zapruder’s office. Four film positives developed at Eastman Kodak after three reversal duplicates developed at Jamison Film Company, using Kodachrome II camera stock furnished to Jamison by Eastman Kodak (emphasis added). Source: Interview of Schwartz by Richard Bartholomew and Noel Twyman, 11/21/94 in Dallas; interview [telecom] with Bruce Jamison 12/26/94. [2009 Update: This I now see as confusing as originally written above. Actually, a total of four positives were developed at Eastman Kodak in Dallas, the first positive from the camera original, after which three positives were developed from the three reversal duplicates made by Jamison from the camera original positive.] About 10:00 pm: Zapruder and Schwartz deliver one copy of the film to Secret Service office in Dallas with understanding that it was to be sent immediately to FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., by courier jet plane. Source: Interview of Schwartz, by Richard Bartholomew and Noel Twyman, in Dallas 11/21/94 ; also Richard B. Stolley in Esquire, 11/1/73, cited by Shackelford. We now might reasonably ask if the U.S. secret service agent Bill Smith was really from the secret service, or, was he an FBI person with a pseudonym taking the film to the NPIC lab? I had written in Bloody Treason , the following: An analysis of the chain of possession of the film shows that in all probability it was in the FBI’s possession when it was altered, while at the same time the Nix film was altered. There is a slight possibility that the Zapruder film could have been altered overnight in Dallas by other conspirators, but even in that unlikely event the altered film would have had to have been substituted for the copy that was sent by special plane and arrived in FBI headquarters early on Saturday morning. Therefore the FBI would have had knowledge of the altered film. There is no scenario that does not implicate the FBI in the film alteration. The obvious problem with the Bill Smith story is that the copy of the original film had already been"},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"developed by Eastman Kodak in Dallas, not Rochester. This leads to support of those who suspect there were two films taken of the assassination. There is much to reinforce this idea in work by Dr. John Costella, Jack White, and others. [740] There are other explanations of the “undeveloped” film that Bill Smith obtained from “the man who had exposed the film.” We should ask who exactly was that man? The most direct answer is Abraham Zapruder himself, instead of a second cameraman. If this is taken as truth, it brings a disturbing complication about Mr. Zapruder. For example, was this the copy that H.L. Hunt’s man, Paul Rothermel, claimed he procured for a substantial sum of money on November 22, 1963? [741] And if so, where did the undeveloped copy come from? One possible answer is that Jamison Film ran one extra reversal duplicate copy, i.e., four instead of three, and it was kept secret for obvious reasons, that is, H. L. Hunt and Zapruder did not want it to be known. Remember that H.L. Hunt and his wife caught a plane under assumed names to Washington, D.C., maybe as early as the afternoon of November 22, or possibly as late as November 24; it’s not exactly clear [742] . The ostensible reason for Hunt fleeing to Washington D.C. was a curious request of the FBI for his safety or, as Hunt said, was it to “be there to help Lyndon?” If for the moment we assume that the copy that Bill Smith took to Eastman Kodak in Rochester was an undeveloped reversal duplicate from Zapruder’s camera (not from a second camera) it is disquieting to me because I detected not a whiff of deception from Erwin Schwartz or Bruce Jamison when I interviewed them. If Mr. Zapruder had requested a secret extra reversal duplicate copy, it seems Jamison would have known. Moreover, all eyewitnesses have stated that Jamison made only three reversal duplicates. Nonetheless, there is irony here. We have the most likely geniuses representing the political power and wealth behind the plot—three of them—LBJ, H.L. Hunt, and J. Edgar Hoover, within a few days after the assassination, together in Washington, D.C. with a secret first copy of the Zapruder film that showed in high color fidelity the president being murdered by multiple shots from front and back, being secretly developed or analyzed by the highest qualified photographic experts in the world, namely CIA’s NPIC and Kodak’s Hawkeyeworks. You’ve got to give these three diabolical geniuses credit for smarts and competence, aside from the fact that they were, arguably, certifiable mad men. They must have seen that, without alteration of the film, the horrible and criminal secrets of all of them would be exposed to the world, and that they had to quickly order the fabrication of a new film or they would all be ruined or much worse, executed. But the decision to alter the film would be an inevitable, natural step inasmuch as the horrific acts of altering of the president’s body (and his X-rays) had already been done. The wheels had come off the perfect plot. Jack Ruby had been ordered to silence the incorrigible patsy , Lee Harvey Oswald, before he spilled the beans to the world. Two last big holes now had to be plugged: First, create a new Zapruder film; and, second, create a commission to cover up all critical legal evidence, i.e., the Warren Commission. As desperate as it was, LBJ, Hoover (with his secret files) and H.L. Hunt were up to the task. It would all be done in the name of preventing World War III—national security—which has now become the standard rationale for covering up dirty national secrets for survival of our nation. We must keep faith in our institutions. So it goes. What can be made about all of this with some degree of certainty? Whom can we believe? Or, was everybody telling the truth? What can we believe? Two things seem very certain: (a) The NPIC lab was at least involved in the beginning analysis of the alteration of the Zapruder film, by selecting out frames showing only three shots from behind, and (b) LBJ and Hoover knew about it because the order to do the selection of frames came from the White House or maybe the FBI. Both (a) and (b) are true regardless of the excursion to Eastman Kodak in Rochester, and whether or not there were two films involved. This helps answer the big question: What did LBJ"},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"(and Hoover) know and when did they know it? This evidence shows that LBJ and Hoover knew about their need for Z-film alterations within about 72 hours of the murder of the president. Keep in mind the telephone conversation between LBJ and Hoover on November 29, 1963 in which Hoover reported his findings that separate shots hit Kennedy and Connally, and Kennedy was hit twice, [743] and that there were three shots total (just as ordered by Bill Smith). All of these recorded telephone conversations of LBJ very likely were part of a deliberate creation of a cover story, and any incriminating conversations between LBJ, Hoover and H.L. Hunt very likely were on direct private wires. For linkages of H.L. Hunt to virtually all of the “persons of interest,” go to Bloody Treason Exhibit 20-2, The French Connection Diagram [744] , and Chapter 24 about H.L. Hunt. And above all let’s not forget Hoover’s direct line to the exotic James Angleton who was very close to Hoover and CIA’s Bill Harvey. [745] (Some believe that Angleton was part of the direct plot.) Until I see more evidence it seems that he, at least, made a terrible mistake in using Oswald in a covert CIA counter-intelligence scheme that backfired. Search on Angleton or read chapter 28 for what I wrote about Angleton and Gerry Hemming. Exactly where the final 8mm version of the altered Zapruder film was fabricated remains unknown by me at this writing. Could it have been at NPIC, or, as David Lifton has suggested, a Hollywood studio; or a film lab in Chicago? We do have from Dr. Ryan that the last step of the process was not done at NPIC because they didn’t have the K-II equipment in 1963 [746] . The super secret Kodak Hawkeyeworks in Rochester could have done it all based on the selection of critical frames by NPIC, and after instructed as to the required results. But we don’t know for sure. Noel Twyman, 2009"},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"APPENDIX G – Author’s Cursory Review of Douglas P. Horne’s Book, “ Inside the Assassination Records Review Board” Mr. Horne was Chief Analyst for Military Research at ARRB. When I was writing Appendix F, I tried to telephone Doug Horne because I felt he had obtained more information, particularly about the involvement of Kodak’s Hawkeyeworks in the Z-Film alteration. But Horne was not receiving calls because of his total effort in getting his manuscript finished. In the interim, I had read what Horne had written in Murder in Dealey Plaza and The Great Zapruder Film Hoax . Later yet I had read Dick Russell’s latest book, On the Trail of the JFK Assassins, and was surprised to find that he had interviewed Horne about the medical evidence and Z-Film alterations. With this material, in late November 2009, I felt reasonably confident that I had interpreted Horne’s work accurately and was right on-the-money with my Appendix F and was ready to publish my E-Book. But I was debating if I should wait for Horne’s Magnum Opus because there was more material to come. Fortunately, in early December 2009 Horne’s book (in five volumes) became available on Amazon.com. I immediately ordered all five volumes and awaited delivery by UPS. Horne’s work proved to be a monumental 1800-page blockbuster, dealing mainly with the medical evidence and the Z-Film. I was pleased to find that he corroborates virtually everything I wrote in Bloody Treason on these subjects and more—about the autopsy, about the Zapruder film; and about David Morales and William Harvey. Based on extensive U.S. government documents Horne corroborated my basic allegations (that were based on Lifton) about the autopsy which I had summarized in my original publication: ...the thrust of these allegations is that the conspirators literally stole the body of President Kennedy from Air Force One, took it to a secret location where they enlarged the bullet exit wound in the lower rear of the skull to make the wound extend to the top and right side of skull, and crudely excised a major portion of the brain to remove incriminating bullet fragments. By performing these operations, they obscured the direction from which the fatal head shot occurred. They then delivered the body to the morgue at the rear of Bethesda Naval Hospital. While all of this was being done, they deceived the public and virtually everyone in government to conceal the momentous crime that had been committed . All of these allegations of horror proved to be true in detail. The “secret location” in which the body was altered, according to Horne, was in the morgue at Bethesda Naval Hospital; and the JFK body alterations were performed by Navy Doctors Humes and Boswell. Horne’s work differs from David Lifton in that major respect. Lifton will write about the differences in his forthcoming book Final Charade . He believes that the primary body alterations were performed before the body was delivered to the morgue at Bethesda, and does not believe that Commander Humes (or Boswell) altered the body. But, Horne readily acknowledges Lifton’s work as being the foundation of the medical evidence, and he is very generous in his praise of him. "},{"pageNumber":650,"pageContent":"As to the Zapruder film, Doug Horne makes it very clear that he now believes that the Z-Film was in fact altered by the conspirators to conceal the truth about what happened at Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963. Writing about ex-Kodak employee Roland Zavada’s report for the ARRB, Horne states: “But since I began to study his report in detail in May of 1999, I have modified my position and now firmly suspect the extant film in the National Archives is a forgery, created from the true original in a sophisticated CIA photo lab at the Kodak main industrial plant in Rochester, New York. That’s right: I just said that I believe that the presumed ‘original’ of the Zapruder film in the National Archives today was not exposed inside Abe Zapruder’s Bell and Howell movie camera, but rather was created in a photo lab run for the CIA by Kodak , at its main industrial site and corporate headquarters, in Rochester, New York (using Abe Zapruder’s camera-original film, of course, as the baseline)...” Horne Volume IV, p 1187. Horne writes that he began his investigation believing that the Z-Film probably was authentic, but as the evidence of alteration grew, he changed his mind. One of Horne’s departures from what I had written in Bloody Treason is that he makes a case that the Z-Film was altered, in part, to conceal the involvement of the U.S. Secret Service in the conspiracy, such as the driver (William Greer) deliberately slowing down the car, if not stopping the vehicle entirely, during the shooting. He also raises the possibility that the driver turned around and shot the President. Although I was aware of this long-standing allegation, I never came to that conclusion. I want to see more evidence. The main item I was looking for in Horne’s book was what he had to say about Kodak’s Hawkeye plant in Rochester: Were they the ones who altered the Z-Film? Horne’s answer is an unequivocal yes . He wrote of his strongly held belief that Kodak’s Hawkeye plant performed the final alteration of the Z- Film. I had suspected this to be true (even if there was a second camera at Dealey Plaza) but had backed away from the thought because I didn’t think I had enough solid material on which to base such an opinion. It made sense, but there were other possibilities of alteration such as, maybe it was done in the hands of Life Magazine in Chicago assisted by George W. Colburn Laboratories there. Or maybe minimal alterations were done overnight in Dallas or even in Hollywood, and the altered films returned to Zapruder before Saturday morning. Or maybe a combination of these elements did it in steps to keep up with public releases by Life Magazine and the Warren Commission. As I was about to set aside the question until I had read more of Horne’s book, I received an E-mail from David Lifton in which he wrote that he had closely read Horne’s chapter about the Z-Film, for the fifth or sixth time, and he now wanted to say, from the onset, that he did not agree with it as to the ‘when and where’ of the Z-Film alteration. But David Lifton told me that he believes it is entirely possible the film went to Hawkeye, only after it was altered (i.e., after a new “master” was created). I agree with that except to say I can see that the simplest, most straight-forward way for LBJ to have accomplished the Z-film alteration was to have it all done at the government’s top secret contractor, Hawkeyeworks, and maneuvered so that CIA Director John McCone (JFK’s appointee) saw only frames selected by LBJ, showing only shots from the rear. After all, this was a palace coup, a fait accompli , wasn’t it? At this point in time I had only hastily read through Horne’s Z-Film chapter. This was now the second disagreement on specifics between Lifton and Horne. I had a decision to"},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"make: Was I going to get into their constructive dialectic, which could take weeks to resolve and require much more research and analysis? The details of the time-line of handling of the Z-Film in Dallas, Chicago, Rochester, and Washington D.C. gets very complicated when all documents and testimonies are studied. Combine this with the fact of two separate covert operations, secret from each other, on the weekend of November 23 and 24, 1963, between White House (Secret Service) people and NPIC (CIA) in Washington D.C., and it really gets complicated when we consider it is based on memories of old men, 34 years after the fact, and perhaps bogus Secret Service Agents. Or, was I going to complete my JFK E-Book with what evidence I already had, that is: 1) Settled Evidence of JFK body alteration 2) Settled Evidence of JFK X-Ray alteration 3) Settled Evidence of Z-Film alteration 4) Settled Evidence that LBJ was in-the-loop of Z-Film alteration and Hoover must have known about it—he was the first one on record to have received a copy, other than Zapruder himself. There is much more that can be added to the list of settled evidence. By that term I mean evidence that has been proved true so many times that there’s no longer room for serious argument. Let the flat-earthers remain in denial. I decided that what I now had was enough for me, and that I would not pursue the fascinating detail further. But I did go through a sould search: Was I running out of the courage to look further into the horror? That is what the JFK assassination is – a horror story. Nonetheless, I decided I would leave that to the younger researchers who were still relentlessly working on the details of the mystery of the ages. As William Shakespeare wrote, conscious does make cowards of us all . What we now see in the JFK assassination is a breakdown of the U.S. Constitution—a failure of the separation and balance of powers. It was and will be a fearful disturbance to patriotic U.S. citizens. The haunting question: Could, or will, it happen again? It seems to me that it is now in the year 2010 in a beginning process, fueled by ideologues, racists, war hawks, and national security paranoiacs. I was happy to see that Doug Horne had cited my interview with Dr. Rod Ryan about the Z-Film. Horne wrote that it was ‘case closed’ regarding hand-painting of the mysterious blobs around JFK’s head —therefore proof of alteration—Horne having gotten corroboration from two other Hollywood film experts. I was also happy to see that Horne had joined in my belief that David Sanchez Morales was very likely the man from CIA who directly managed the assassination, along with CIA’s Bill Harvey as a master planner. Horne didn’t mince words. Horne’s assessment of Barr McClellan’s book Blood, Money and Power: How LBJ Killed JFK , was very close to my interpretation except that Horne was a bit stronger than I, and he went into more detail than I about Mac Wallace’s fingerprints. Here is my evaluation of McClellan’s book: This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to learn more about the JFK assassination. But it does have its share of serious faults and pitfalls, and the outline of the conspiracy he describes is much too simple. However, if its key aspects prove to be accurate, it is very important. McClellan wrote of Lyndon Johnson’s near death confession to his lawyer Don Thomas in which LBJ said, in effect, that “I had to do it; I had no choice; that damned Bobbie [Robert Kennedy] was"},{"pageNumber":652,"pageContent":"closing in on me, stirring everything, surrounding me. I was about to be killed and had to shoot back.” In other words, survival instinct made LBJ do it. McClellan readily states, understandably, that he doesn’t have tapes or documents to back this up. And, I would add, such probably never existed—after all, high level criminals and traitors are not known for leaving paper or magnetic trails. McClellan also wrote that LBJ’s hit-man, Mac Wallace, along with Oswald, were the gunmen on the sixth floor, and a third gunman recruited by Wallace was shooting from the grassy knoll area. He presents evidence of Mac Wallace’s fingerprints on cardboard boxes on the sixth floor, and includes evidence that Wallace was a convicted murderer; and did other murders ordered by LBJ in Texas. This has been reported and written about extensively by others and is, by and large, convincing. The fingerprint evidence is backed up by a private fingerprint analyst and a key fingerprint expert at Interpol in Europe. McClellan was a partner in the Austin, Texas law firm that handled LBJ’s legal work and other matters over his entire political career. The name of the firm in 1960 was Clark, Mathews, Thomas, Harris & Denius . The head of the firm was LBJ’s long time friend Edward Aubrey Clark, who according to McClellan, was the man who took care of LBJ’s crimes including assassination of President Kennedy. Don Thomas was another close friend of LBJ and was a partner in the firm. McClellan joined the firm in 1966 and was there for about ten years before leaving. He became a full partner in 1972. He writes that it was common talk among the lawyers in the firm that LBJ was behind the killing of JFK. He put together the story about the near death confession from specific discussions with Don Thomas and other lawyers in the firm, including associate attorney John Coates. This material, in its full context, deserves careful reading in McClellan’s book, keeping in mind that its most important parts are hearsay, or even double hearsay, from a “death bed” confession but admissible in a court of law, in some cases, when it is part of other strong circumstantial evidence. [See Chapter 9, Questions of Evidence.] I am inclined to believe it because it fits into all the other evidence, and my sense is that Barr McClellan is being very honest about this terrible subject, particularly regarding his private conversations with the other lawyers in the firm. A fault I do find in McClellan’s book is that he leaves out important evidence that could explain the larger plot. He writes essentially nothing about the New Orleans evidence (Bannister, Ferrie, Oswald, Clay Shaw, the CIA) the military, the mafia, the French connection, William Harvey and ZR/Rifle, David Morales, anti-Castro Cubans, Angleton, and Oswald in Mexico City. I can see how a combination of these elements could have been joined into the conspiracy after the word was out that LBJ would be behind it. It concerns me that McClellan, in confining the plot to LBJ and Texas big oil, tends to let other main culprits off the hook and, paradoxically, LBJ becomes a sort of scapegoat, albeit an evil and deserving one. As the years go by and more is developed about this huge rupture in American history that occurred on that fateful day it becomes clear that it went beyond the assassination of John F. Kennedy. I’m speaking here of the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and what it tells us about the psyche of our nation, or will tell us, if the complete, ugly truth forces its way out of our minds-in-denial. There are more possibilities to be addressed, such as, was it really Clark and LBJ who started the plot, or was Clark acting on behalf of a plot by others, sponsored by J. Edgar Hoover, H. L. Hunt, and Clint Murchison, (who, in turn, joined with the mob and Bill Harvey), to get LBJ’s approval before it all went ahead to the tragic end? There was only one substantial criticism of Bloody Treason I have found so far in Horne’s book. He"},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"wrote, in effect, that I was incorrect in stating that J. Edgar Hoover was the one behind the alteration of the Z-Film. Horne wondered if, in light of what he has written, I would change my mind. My answer is, “ yes, but .” The but being that I had focused on Hoover as the most likely guilty party, mainly because the documented information at the time showed that he was the first to get a first-copy of the Z-Film, sent to him by the Secret Service by special courier on the night (or afternoon) of November 22; this is reported in my time-line in Bloody Treason (and seemingly confirmed by Cartha DeLoach in his book) but now, challenged by Horne, based in part on Richard Trask’s book National Nightmare on Six Feet of Film, which, I agree, makes a strong case that the FBI didn’t get the film until 5:20 pm on November 23, about 18 hours later than DeLoach stated. My mistake in writing was that I was not careful enough to make it very clear that Hoover was my number one suspect at the time because he had the motive, the means (the power), and the opportunity to direct others to do the alteration. I still say that what I wrote in Bloody Treason —that Hoover had to know early-on about Z-Film alterations and therefore was complicit from the beginning in the conspiracy to alter the film—because, at the very least, the altered film had to be switched with the FBI’s first copy. Horne addresses this in his book. However, in light of Horne’s release of the McMahon/Hunter/Brugioni/NPIC material, I want him to know I have changed my mind because, for the first time thanks to Horne, we have convincing evidence that LBJ was in-the-loop and most likely the one who ordered the Z-Film alteration; but, with at least J. Edgar Hoover’s knowledge . Doug Horne concludes that “...the National Security State killed President Kennedy...” I can’t argue much with him on that, but it could not have happened without bringing Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover into the plot before the fact , if they were not themselves the master planners, along with H. L. Hunt, General Charles Willoughby, CIA’s Bill Harvey, James Angleton, and the French Connection—but this isn’t the National Security State—at least as I think of the term—a question of semantics, perhaps? Maybe it’s what the National Security State could sink to if given the necessary evil people in the right positions, and in the right circumstances. Quoted below is a vital paragraph in Horne’s book where he summarizes his conclusion regarding Mafia in the conspiracy: “My own conclusion is that the evidence does not preclude (to borrow a favorite phrase of the HSCA’s final report) the use of organized crime hit men as the actual people who pulled some of the triggers in Dealey Plaza. But this is a far cry from claiming that the assassination was a simple Mob hit, from start to finish. The destruction of key evidence by the Federal government (autopsy photos and x-rays, the Harper fragment, and the limousine’s interior and windshield, for example); and the introduction of tainted evidence by the Federal government (altered skull x-rays, fraudulent brain photographs, dishonest photographs of the President’s head wounds, planted bullets, a substituted windshield, a rewritten autopsy report, and an altered Zapruder film)—together are the strongest indicators that JFK’s assassination was not a simple “Mob hit.” Furthermore, the rapidity with which these criminal actions occurred (particularly the alteration of wounds on the body, the planting of bullets, and the alteration of the Zapruder film) is the surest indicator that the government was not simply covering up a Mob hit to hide the CIA’s use of the Mafia in the attempted assassination of Castro. If the coverup was a benign one, then the government would first have had to establish that the Mob did it in the first place, and that would have taken weeks, even it [if] that were the case. But the President’s wounds were altered the day of his death; bullets were planted the day of his death; and the Zapruder film was altered during the weekend following his death. The timing of these actions—and the actors who performed them—are the surest indicators that it was the national security state that killed President Kennedy, not the national syndicate of Organized Crime."},{"pageNumber":654,"pageContent":"Finally, the identification of Oswald’s handler as David Atlee Phillips, and the confession of David Sanchez Morales, both prove that the JFK assassination was not a simple Mob killing. Rather, it was an assassination by the state, in which the state set up the patsy; organized the operational plan for the assassination; and gave the orders to carry out the crime.” I agree with Horne on all of this and so stated in Bloody Treason , but maybe not as succinctly and not using the term National Security State . Horne’s book seems to be similar to that in Oliver Stone’s movie, JFK ; that is, assassination of the President by the military industrial complex. Mine is more like assassination by mortally threatened political enemies joined by ideologues, militarists, and men with criminal minds. We may never know for sure who initiated the plot, or if it went together all at once, as I described in the first publication of Bloody Treason . What came first, the hen or the egg? In closing, I believe that virtually all of my basic conclusions about the JFK assassination have been proven to be sound. Thank you Douglas P. Horne for your heroic work.

The scope is just too vast. So I set forth very early to obtain cooperation from other authors whose work I admired and from researchers in the field who had accumulated experience over the many years since the assassination. I was not disappointed in my quest for help. In fact, the relationships with these people would prove to be among the most rewarding aspects of my endeavor. Cooperation was forthcoming from virtually everyone I approached. This ranged from private citizens whose technical and professional skills I sought, to actual witnesses to the assassination, or in the periphery and aftermath. And, surprisingly, I found cooperation from retired government officials who were close to John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. It is impossible for me to express who helped the most. I will begin with one closest to home, living here in San Diego, and go from there. Robert Livingston, M.D., medical scientist and expert on the structure and function of the brain, provided many hours of consultation and advice. David Mantik, M.D., physicist and radiation oncologist then at Eisenhower Memorial Hospital who had access to the autopsy materials in the National Archives, taught me the rudiments of x-ray technology, and shared with me the scientific evidence of conspiracy that he developed concerning Kennedy’s x-rays. And Louis Kartsonis, M.D., who also had access to the autopsy materials and provided guidance in the early stages of my investigation. [2009 Update: Dr. Mantik has continued to be of great help in advising me in this E-Book edition with considerable guidance as to relevant new material.] I want to thank David Lifton, author of Best Evidence . He provided help in understanding his work and gave constructive criticism on how to write a book of this kind. I hold his pioneer work to be the largest single contribution to the solution of the John F. Kennedy murder mystery. In addition, David Lifton helped me extensively in my analysis of the Zapruder film; he inspired me to give it highest priority when he lectured at a conference in Dallas; he shared his hard-gotten copy of the film with me; he gave me counsel and criticism on my initial proof of the forgery, himself having noticed Secret Service Agent Greer’s excessively rapid movement in the limousine near the time of the fatal head shot. I also thank Dr. James Fetzer, McKnight Professor at the University of Minnesota, who I later learned had observed Greer’s impossibly rapid head turn and noted it in a memorandum. Professor Fetzer provided me with much encouragement in my research. I thank Dick Russell, author of The Man Who Knew Too Much , who helped me understand why I should believe the story of Richard Case Nagell. Russell’s book stands out to me as the single most comprehensive non-scientific compilation of new evidence yet published. And Anthony Summers, whose works on the Kennedy assassination and J. Edgar Hoover have been most valuable. And Paul Hoch, an invaluable critic of evidence, who has tried to keep me on the straight and narrow path. Anna Marie Kuhns-Walko, a dedicated genius at finding documents in the National Archives, provided me with thousands of selected pages of newly released documents and assisted me in reducing that material to a manageable level. Mary Ferrell generously gave her time and encouragement and shared her vast knowledge of the Kennedy assassination. Mary is a rare and colorful person, unique in American history, and, in my judgment, deserving of the highest honors for her relentless pursuit of evidence concerning the Kennedy assassination over the past thirty-four years. I thank my patient and generous sister, Patricia Baumgartner, who worked many evenings and weekends typing manuscripts [and did the same in converting and updating this E-Book edition]. And Deborah Stockton and Lee Ann Hubbard, who provided their publishing and editing skills in the final"},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":"stages to make this book a reality. A special word of thanks to David Swift, screenwriter, producer, and director, who encouraged me not to give up. He devoted many hours trying to help me find a publisher, and he introduced me to motion picture editor Leon Carrere, from whom I learned about techniques of movie film editing. I also thank George Kendall, who taught me about film editing machines and who introduced me to Peter Silverman, who introduced me to Dr. Rod Ryan, who taught me about film development technology. I thank my good friend Vice Admiral Robert Baldwin, who introduced me to retired naval officers who had direct experience with naval intelligence. A special acknowledgment is extended to the retired government officials, military officers, and private citizens who granted me interviews. Their hours of discussions with me shed much-needed light on the circumstances and state of knowledge surrounding the Kennedy assassination within the government in 1963 and to the present day. My thanks to the hundreds of writers and researchers who have never given up in their efforts to reveal the terrible nature of the crime and its implications for the future of the United States of America. This book is only a continuation of their sacrifices and labor over the past thirty years. Special among these were veteran researchers Robert Dorff, who gave so much time and effort that I have lost account of it; Gary Shaw, author of Cover-Up , who provided his advice and his wonderful notes on his interviews with Colonel William Bishop; and Gaeton Fonzi, staff member of the House Select Committee on Assassinations and author of The Last Investigation , whose advice and counsel in the last two years was indispensable. And what can I say to express my thanks to Charles Marler? He volunteered to conduct independent tests and analysis concerning my proof of the missing frames in the Zapruder film. He worked many hours and weekends at his expense and freely provided me with the results of his tests which confirmed my original experiments. Those who helped me gave freely of themselves, demonstrating the need of large numbers of American people to get to the truth of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. But, in the end, the conclusion and judgments that I have reached are my own, and are not attributable to nor endorsed by any of those who helped me along the way."},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":" END NOTES [1] Murder in Dealey Plaza , edited by James H. Fetzer, pp 219-298 [2] www.assassinationscience.com /johncostella/jfk [3] A suggestion to the reader: It is not necessary to start at the beginning and read chapter by chapter all the way through the book. Some readers may wish to skip around as their energy level and interests vary. Much detail is provided. I suggest, however, that Part 1 be read completely before skipping to other chapters. Looking at all of the photographs first and reading their captions will be useful to become acquainted with the major characters (see Index of Photographs). [4] This is a method I learned as a systems engineer and businessman solving large, complex problems in the materials processing, electric power, and aerospace industries. When approaching a problem, it is best to look first at the obvious; the broad picture; the tips of the icebergs, from which a tentative solution can be derived; then to proceed in depth. [5] This description of the practices of the CIA and military intelligence is a composite taken from works by Marrs, Mangold, Blum, Prados, McCoy, Brugioni, Russell, Marks, and Marchetti, and documents from the National Archives. The CIA mind-control programs have been thoroughly exposed and documented in the Church Committee Report. (See Bibliography and Notes.) The CIA penetration of news media is summarized in Namebase Newsline, Journalism and the CIA, April-June 1997, citing a wide range of sources. [6] For simplicity, I use the term “Mafia” and “organized crime” interchangeably, although there is a distinction. “Mafia” generally means the Sicilian arm of organized crime—sometimes also referred to as “Cosa Nostra.” “Organized crime” includes both the Mafia and its affiliates such as Meyer Lansky (“the Jewish Mafia”) and Jimmy Hoffa of the Teamsters Union. Evidence of CIA involvement with the Mafia is included in Chapters 20 and 21. [7] See Chapter 4 for a discussion of evidence that Marilyn Monroe was murdered, and its ramifications. [8] See Chapter 31 for evidence of Lyndon Johnson’s corruption. [9] See Chapter 15 for more on Robert Kennedy’s crusade against organized crime [10] Letter from Burt W. Griffin to Mrs. Martin J. Parker, dated July 30, 1976: “I am personally shocked and feel betrayed that such ‘cover-up’ activities have occurred. I still believe that the Commission, with the possible exception of Allen Dulles, did not participate in any cover-up, but that it was the work of others. I am certain that none of the staff people with whom I worked closely knew of any cover-up activities.” "},{"pageNumber":663,"pageContent":"[11] The statements in this chapter are a composite of information taken primarily from the Warren Commission Report, plus a variety of other sources that will be cited in the chapters that follow. [12] According to a Time/CNN Poll, only 13% believed the Warren Commission. Polls taken over the years from 1964 to 1990 showed a steady decline in the faith of the American people in their government: from 80% in 1964 (just after the Kennedy assassination) to 20% in 1990. A CBS poll reported by Dan Rather on May 30, 1996 for the CBS Evening News showed that 89% of the American people did not believe that Oswald acted alone. [13] The reader is reminded that in constructing an hypothesis, one is allowed to speculate, if done rationally. [14] Abraham H. Maslow, Motivation and Personality [15] Abraham H.

Also, who had the most to gain by Marilyn Monroe’s death? The Kennedy brothers, above all others; if incriminating diaries and tapes about them could be confiscated and kept from public view.

[30] The reader is advised to keep in mind that this is my initial hypothesis, not necessarily my conclusion. [31] The term used by the CIA is “false sponsor”; that is, creating false information or planting evidence to direct the blame to an innocent, yet plausible, person or group. See Chapters 20 and 21. [32] Please read Chapter 31 for much more on Lyndon Johnson. [33] Please read Chapter 9, Questions of Evidence , for a discussion of the legal concept of “best evidence” as related to scientific concepts. [34] The possibility of an “induced cover-up” by the CIA or FBI will be considered as the book progresses. That is, fear of exposure of their dark secrets if the crime were to be solved could conceivably have induced the CIA or FBI to cooperate in the cover-up. [35] Col. Oleg Nechiporenko, former KGB intelligence officer, wrote about conspiracies: “The presence of several people, concluding a secret agreement of joint activities, creates the need for a ruling structure to lead these activities and to control the implementation of its responsibilities.” Passport to Assassination, p. 142. (Emphasis added) [36] Author’s Note: The U.S. did not promise never to invade Cuba under any circumstances (Garthoff, p. 127), but for the purpose of this semi-fictional chapter I am taking a hypothetical point of view of the conspirators; and it remains a controversy whether or not the missiles were actually removed. But it is certain that the U.S. never insisted on on-site inspection to absolutely verify their removal; Castro refused, and JFK did not press the matter (Garthoff, Reflections on the Cuban Missile Crisis, p. 123). [37] Author’s Note: Again, this may not have been exactly what ultimately happened. Shortly before Robert Kennedy was assassinated, he had stated that only by becoming president would he be able to determine the truth about his brother’s assassination. Perhaps the plotters underestimated Robert Kennedy’s resolve, and were forced to kill him later when it became apparent that he would very likely become president. The assassination of Robert Kennedy will not be included in the scope of this book, although the full knowledge of what happened there, as well as the assassination of Martin Luther King, holds promise of finally rounding out the complete story. [38] Author’s Note: This was confirmed on November 22, 1993, when President Clinton, a most intelligent and informed president, stated on national television that he believed Oswald acted alone. This, thirty years after his idol, John Kennedy, was murdered in Dallas. President Clinton apparently had too many other problems on his platter than to deal with the past. Also, he had just visited with the Kennedys at Martha’s Vineyard while on vacation. Was the subject of the government’s position on the assassination discussed? Did President Clinton defer to the Kennedys’ need to bury the matter? [39] In the fall of 1993 (after I had written this chapter), a new book was published entitled Passport to Assassination by Col. Oleg M. Nechiporenko in which he outlined his fundamental analysis of the nature and structure of conspiracies. Nechiporenko was an officer in the Russian equivalent of the CIA (the KGB) and was stationed in Mexico City when Oswald went there in September 1963. Nechiporenko wrote that the main attributes indicating conspiracy are the agreement of several people and secrecy. He"},{"pageNumber":665,"pageContent":"states that, “Clearly, secrecy sets a critical limit to the participants; if it is exceeded, it becomes practically impossible to maintain a conspiracy” (p. 141). He says a conspiracy can be conditionally classified on the number of participants in two categories: maximum number equals a large conspiracy, minimum number a small conspiracy. He says these principles are universal and are followed by the intelligence services, the Mafia, and any criminal organization. Nechiporenko outlines the basic structure of a conspiracy: setting up the task; financial arrangements; organizers-directors; professionals in operational or criminal activity; security of information; determining the place and time; completion of the big conspiracy; selection and leadership of the managers; common scenario of the big conspiracy (the plan). He then goes on to outline that the managers of the conspiracy would be specialists in various fields of knowledge: determination of the “battle field” (in our case, Dealey Plaza); firming up the plan; preparing the resources; selection of the executors; selection of the cover-up leaders. He says that the executioners would be professional killers, both primary and reserve. He also writes that the cover-up and support group would consist of specialists in other areas which would be: realization of diversionary tactics, including the creation of a patsy; getting the executioners to the “battle field”; their evacuation or liquidation upon completion; insuring the scapegoats’ discovery or liquidation (pp. 142-143). He says at first glance this model may appear to be too large or overly bureaucratic but that its structure makes a great deal of sense. “Any bureaucracy always strives to minimize responsibility for its own mistakes while carrying out its basic functions” (p. 143). He says the structure of the Mafia provides an example of this principle along with intelligence services’ operational work, which is based on the same principles. Upon reading this analysis written by a KGB colonel who shared an office with Kostikov, a KGB officer in the “Liquid Affairs” branch (assassinations), I noted that my hypothetical master plan seemed to include all these elements. I re-read this chapter and found that indeed it did; it also included an item that Nechiporenko had omitted: a plan to control the political repercussions in the aftermath of the murder and takeover. Perhaps the colonel did not see that element as necessary in Russia, where brutal military repression would be taken for granted. I reflected that, of any people, the Russians would have the greatest insight into the nature of conspiracies, particularly conspiracies to assassinate their leaders. Russia’s history of assassinating leaders perhaps exceeds that of any other nation in modern history. [40] The term “shadow of a doubt” is not a legal term and is often misused. [41] In numerous cases in recent years, the term “moral certainty” has been eliminated from the definition of reasonable doubt. [42] This definition by Justice Kennedy was given on March 17, 1994 in the “Trial of Hamlet,” a mock trial on C-Span television on December 25, 1994. [43] I say “virtually” because there is a smattering of superficial evidence of other shots (such as a bullet found 500 yards from the scene) that has not been included here. Also, evidence of shots from the scientific acoustical analysis, although supporting a conclusion of more than one gunman, is not included here because of its controversial, maybe doubtful, validity. [44] Gaeton Fonzi writes about the CIA’s capability for developing and delivering exotic weapons of assassination (Fonzi, The Last Investigation, p. 68). Also, see Exhibit 10-3 concerning sabot bullets. [45] A detailed analysis of John and Nellie Connally’s testimonies is included in the Zapruder frame"},{"pageNumber":666,"pageContent":"analysis (in color section). [46] The autopsy pathologists also did not dissect the throat wound to see where it went, despite being informed by telephone before the autopsy (as a suggestion) to do so by the chief of the U.S. Neurobiological Laboratory at the time, Dr. Robert Livingston. (Letter to author, July 7, 1994.) [47] See Appendix C for discussion about controversy regarding this subject. [48] Mary Ferrell is renowned as an authority and collector of JFK assassination documents. Most serious authors go to her for advice and documents. She resides in Dallas, Texas. Her documents were used by the HSCA as a prime source in its investigation. [49] The nature of Kennedy’s wounds will be examined thoroughly in the chapters immediately following. [50] The Mexico City evidence will be discussed in Chapter 19 [51] In its zeal to discredit assassination conspiracy theories, the Journal of the American Medical Association attacked the book Conspiracy of Silence by Gary Shaw and Dr. Charles Crenshaw, who was present at the Parkland Hospital emergency room when President Kennedy arrived there after the assassination. Unfortunately for the JAMA, its attack was based on false information and poor research. Dr. Crenshaw and Shaw sued the JAMA and were awarded a large financial settlement. The JAMA was required by the court to print an article retracting its statements about Dr. Crenshaw and to publish an apology. [52] These experts will be discussed later in this chapter. [53] Bruce Jamison told me that the three copies were made using the contact printing process, and that all of the information from the original would be exactly duplicated on the copies, including edge images and film stock symbols. Unless unique optical and film editing techniques were used, the only way in which the original would differ from the copies would be in the film stock I.D. printings on the film edge: the copies would almost certainly have two sets of I.D. printings—the original printings and the printings of the camera stock used to make the reversal duplicates. This undoubtedly gave the forgers grave problems in preserving the original printing. Dr. David Mantik is researching this aspect. His work is scheduled to be published in 1997 in a new book, Assassination Science: Experts Speak Out on the Death of JFK, ed. James H. Fetzer. [54] Erwin Schwartz disagrees with Stolley here. In a 11/21/94 interview, Schwartz said he personally delivered the original to Stolley at the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas on either November 26 or 27. Stolley may have been given a copy on November 23 and then the original on November 26 or 27, although Schwartz does not remember Stolley getting a copy on November 23. [55] Not shown in the September 1964 issue were frames missing while the limousine was behind the freeway sign, explained as an inadvertent break in the film while handling by Life lab technicians. [56] In my interview, Erwin Schwartz was under the impression that negative copies were made at Jamison Film, but in a later telephone conversation with Bruce Jamison (partner in the firm in 1963), I learned that three “reversal dupes” were made on Kodachrome II camera stock furnished by Eastman Kodak in Dallas; from these, positive prints were developed later in the day at Eastman Kodak in Dallas."},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":" [57] In 1995 the book Hoover’s FBI (1995) by Cartha “Deke” DeLoach, J. Edgar Hoover’s number- three man, was published. DeLoach made a very curious statement when he wrote about first seeing the Zapruder film. He said that he had viewed the Zapruder film in FBI headquarters “on television” at 3 a.m. on November 23, 1963. This would be on Saturday morning, the day after the assassination. This statement is certainly not true because the Zapruder film was not shown on television until years later. It seems very unlikely that the film could have arrived at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., and been converted to a television tape in such a short period of time. It seems much more likely that DeLoach was watching a projection on a screen of a copy of the actual film. Another curiosity is that DeLoach wrote of the “...jerky image of John Kennedy pitching suddenly forward...” (pp. 138-139). The Zapruder film that we have all seen shows unmistakably the president’s head and body being thrust suddenly backward. DeLoach either has a very faulty memory or saw the original, unaltered film which could, indeed, have shown JFK being pitched forward only to have those frames deleted later in the film alteration. This reporting of JFK being pitched forward was also made by Dan Rather of CBS who saw what was in all probability the original film on Saturday morning, November 23, 1963 in Zapruder’s office in Dallas. Moreover, Life magazine originally reported that JFK fell forward. But, when challenged, they changed their story to that of a backward movement. We may very well be seeing here something important in the timing of when the film was altered—namely, while in the hands of the FBI in Washington, D.C. [58] This was reported in Gentleman Spy by Peter Grose, who wrote: “From all surviving evidence, it can be judged that Allen’s relationship with Luce was surely more than platonic but less intense than the affairs of his younger days, for instance with Wally Toscanini Castelbarco. His supportive wife had long since found her caring place in his diffuse life, but Allen ever enjoyed the company of hearty, opinionated women who talked tough. It may be worth noting that Clare Luce’s husband, Henry Luce of Time Inc., was finding much interest at this time in a relationship with Allen’s former mistress, Mary Bancroft.” ( Gentleman Spy , p. 430N) [59] I would later find out that more than an optical printer would be required to reduce the 35mm film back down to 8mm on Kodachrome II film stock. [60] How suspicious that Oswald, an avowed Communist, traitor, and “promoter” of pro-Castro literature, and who was being watched by the FBI, would be employed in top-secret photographic work for the U.S. government. [61] Photographic expertise for extensive alteration of film was available also in government at the FBI labs and the National Photographic Interpretation Center in Washington, D.C. [62] Schwartz had told us in the interview that once the film print was made, he, Zapruder, and a few employees of Eastman Kodak viewed the film there on the spot. At that viewing, the 16mm film had not been split. Stolley said, “you could see only one half on one side.” [63] The “challengers” I can now report were author Harrison Livingstone and two researchers working with him, Martin Shackelford and Daryll Weatherly. Harrison Livingstone published his new book, Killing Kennedy: And the Hoax of the Century, in the spring of 1995. I was not happy with what he had written. Marler and I had both hoped that when we advised him that he and his group were looking at the wrong frames he would back off and leave the rapid head/body turn subject alone until I could publish. But he did not do so. He wrote about degrees of head turn in frames 302-303 and 316-317 with which Marler, Dr. Mantik, and I did not agree. Livingstone acknowledged that we may have been looking"},{"pageNumber":668,"pageContent":"at different frames than he. Unfortunately, he did not include photos of the actual frames that he was looking at for his reader to study. Also, Livingstone apparently was not aware (I never talked with him) that my study was based on the maximum achievable rate of angular velocity, not on a missing frame count exhibited by Greer’s head and body in 302, 303 and 316, 317 compared to our tests with athletes. This is unfortunate because both David Lifton and Marler had presented my work based on missing frame counts. Later I decided that the angular velocity was the only way to analyze it because frame counts are very deceiving— head and body turns start with miniscule frame counts and build up in degrees as the turn accelerates. I now regret that I agreed to let David Lifton present what we call the “rapid head turn” before I had finished my work and was ready to publish. This led to Marler’s articles and now, finally, my book, which was published only after extensive study and consultation with experts. I wish that Livingstone had held off until I could finish my work and publish, but he was unwilling to do so. Perhaps after he reads this book he will agree with my work. I also want to correct Harrison Livingstone in his statement on page 172 of his book Killing Kennedy that seems to imply that Dr. Mantik endorses his analysis. I talked with Dr. Mantik about this after I had seen that Livingstone had made that statement, and Dr. Mantik told me that he, indeed, agreed with the estimates of angles I am reporting here. [64] Conveniently not mentioned by Gerald Posner is a point made by Dr. Roger McCarthy, president of Failure Analysis, Inc., in a mock trial held by the American Bar Association in San Francisco in the summer of 1992. Dr. McCarthy stated, “...there is a latency delay of 200 milliseconds between the time that a message is delivered by either traumatic shock to the spine or by your mind to a muscle before you can get movement...” He went on to state that Kennedy would not have been hit any later than frame 221, at a minimum, and therefore Kennedy and Connally were hit by separate bullets. [65] Posner describes Thorburn’s Position: “Named after the English physician who discovered it over a hundred years ago, it refers to spinal injury that forces the victim’s arms to jerk up into a fixed position, almost parallel with the chin, the hands gathered near the chin and the elbows pushed out to the sides” (Posner, Case Closed, p. 328). [66] Josiah Thompson, Six Seconds in Dallas. [67] Presented by Sherry Pool Gutierrez, CSCSA, at COPA meeting in Washington, D.C., October 21, 1995. [68] Summary and documentation of witnesses who saw the limousine come to a complete stop or slow down is in Vince Palamara, “47 Witnesses, Delay on Elm St.,” Third Decade , Vol. 8, #2-3 (Jan.- Mar., 1992), p. 55. Of the twenty-one witnesses who said they saw the limousine stop completely, six were Dallas policemen. Also, see text in Chapter 12. [69] These allegations are derived primarily from David Lifton’s monumental and pioneer book Best Evidence . Lifton’s work is essential to understanding the evidence concerning the autopsy. It is perhaps the most important discovery in the JFK assassination. I made a point of getting to know David Lifton early when I started working on this book. We spent many long hours together discussing and debating the evidence. He has been indispensable. We have had strong disagreements and misunderstandings. But after getting to know David Lifton very well, I observed that he is a man of intellectual integrity and would not write of anything that he did not believe to be true, and only after exhaustive analysis. This, however, is not to say that he has always been right. Lifton himself has written that he proceeded a little too rapidly in the early days of his research when he was very young. Some critics still go back to Lifton’s early writings and try to discredit him. But none, in my view, has been able to discredit the main thrust of his"},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"work in Best Evidence. His work has been very controversial, compelling many to deny it. It took a gigantic, prolonged effort on my part to overcome my instinct to reject Lifton’s conclusions about the medical evidence. But, finally, with the exceptions that are noted in the text, I concluded that Lifton’s discoveries rank at the very top of the list. The specific wording of the above allegations, however, is my own; at this point they are only allegations, which do not necessarily agree with Lifton. [70] David Lifton, Best Evidence: Disguise and Deception in the Assassination of John F. Kennedy, p. 600, 674; also my disussion with Aubrey Rike in November 1992. Also, Charles A. Crenshaw, M.D., JFK: Conspiracy of Silence, p. 110. Dr. Crenshaw confirms that the body was “wrapped in two white sheets” before it was placed in the coffin at Parkland Hospital. [71] A small wound of entry in the head, within the hairline in the right temple, could have been overlooked, although two of the doctors did state that they noticed a small wound in the left temple which certainly was not there. Some researchers reason that these doctors may simply have confused right with left, not uncommon when referring to locations on a body. [72] David Lifton has documented that, at the time of the swearing-in ceremony, all of Kennedy’s aides and Jacqueline Kennedy were in a forward compartment of Air Force One, thus leaving the coffin unattended for a few minutes. The coffin could have been opened at that time and the body hidden somewhere on Air Force One ; a most likely spot was in a cargo hatch directly below where the coffin was placed. Craig Roberts in his book Kill Zone (pp. 75-77) has proposed this possibility. He discovered through research of the design of Air Force One that there is a large cargo compartment, accessible by a trap door, underneath the carpeting in front of where the coffin was placed. It would have been a simple matter to open the coffin, remove the body, and drop the body into the lower compartment where it would later be removed from the aircraft in a body bag, through a bottom cargo door—either in Dallas and flown separately back to Washington, or after Air Force One landed at Andrews Air Force Base in Washington. See Exhibit 13-4. [73] Dennis David retired from the Navy as a Lt. Commander. He first told of the two ambulances and two caskets to the Washington News Sun, reported in its article on May 1, 1975. He was first interviewed in depth by David Lifton in 1979 (Lifton, pp. 620-621) and appeared on KRON television in San Francisco in 1988, relating the same story he told Lifton: Dennis David stated that he witnessed the arrival of the first ambulance at the rear of Bethesda Hospital. He said it was a black Cadillac ambulance as opposed to a gray Navy ambulance. He said that Dr. Boswell and Dr. Humes were present, plus the chief of the Army medical departments, and the chief of the Air Force medical departments. He said that Boswell knew there were two caskets. David said the casket came in through the “back gate” from the east entrance off Jones Bridge Road at approximately 6:45 p.m. Accompanying the casket were six or seven civilians whom he assumed were Secret Service people. He also said there were two civilians in white smocks, one driving the hearse and the other in the front seat. David witnessed the casket being taken off the hearse and seven or eight men carrying the casket into the morgue. He said it obviously wasn’t just an empty casket, because it appeared much heavier than that, and he could see the strain on the men who carried it. When Lifton asked David what the casket looked like, David said, “It was a gray metal casket. Just a gray, fairly plain, gray plain metal casket.” When Lifton asked him if it was a polished bronze casket, David replied, “No, it wasn’t. It was a gray metal casket I saw” (Lifton, pp. 571-585). (Emphasis added) [74] Jerrol Custer first told his story for public disclosure to David Lifton. Custer was one of the first Bethesda personnel to see Kennedy’s body. Lifton wrote: Custer told me the President’s wound was"},{"pageNumber":670,"pageContent":"enormous—“I could put both of my hands in the wound. Okay?” and that he believed he had been shot from the front... (Lifton, p. 619). He said that he exposed the x-ray film and returned to the morgue, x-rays showing that the rear of the President’s head was blown off. Custer then went on to say that after he had taken the x-rays, he left the morgue, and as he was walking through the main foyer he saw Jacqueline Kennedy coming in through the main entrance. He said that he already had taken the x-rays. He said, “Oh, definitely. This was even the second or third trip.” Custer said that he saw Jacqueline from a distance of ten or fifteen yards. “I saw her, because she stuck out like a sore thumb.” He continued to the hallway and took an elevator upstairs to get his films processed (Lifton, pp. 620-621). “Here was the strongest evidence that the President’s body was at Bethesda before Jacqueline got there. She entered the hospital no later than seven o’clock. Outside the hospital door stood the Navy ambulance, with the Dallas casket. Yet Custer already had in his hands x-rays of President Kennedy’s body” (Lifton, p. 621). Jerrol Custer related this same story on KRON-TV in San Francisco in 1988, along with Paul O’Connor, Dennis David, and Aubrey Rike, who also related their stories as stated in this book. [75] The “ambulance chase” is a very complex story, possibly involving two Navy ambulances. It is related in detail in Lifton’s Best Evidence, pp. 402-405 and pp. 408-412, quoting interviews with James Felder and Hubert Clark, both members of the casket team. [76] O’Connor’s visual estimate of the amount of brain remaining (25%) in the skull was independently confirmed three years after this interview in an optical density analysis of the autopsy x- rays by radiation oncologist Dr. David Mantik! (See Chapter 14.) [77] Lifton, Best Evidence, pp. 609-610 [78] Lifton, Best Evidence, p. 630 [79] Lifton, Best Evidence, p. 701 [80] O’Connor’s testimony to the HSCA, released in 1994, tells of the hearse being at the rear of the hospital and relates Jerrol Custer’s remarks to him about seeing Mrs. Kennedy in the lobby afterwards, but it does not state directly that there was a decoy ambulance at the front. To my knowledge, there are no government documents of Dennis David’s or Jerrol Custer’s statements. [81] In November 1995 I obtained a copy of the tape of the Lipsey interview and listened to it carefully. Lipsey did, in fact, talk of the decoy ambulance at the front of the hospital with Jacqueline Kennedy, just as the HSCA had written. Also, in the interview, Lipsey said several times that while he was watching the autopsy he was absolutely and unequivocally certain that Kennedy had been shot three times. He described three distinctly separate wounds: the large wound on the head, a small wound in the “upper neck,” and another small wound in the “lower neck.” He was very specific that there were three separate wounds. This, of course, nullifies the Warren Commission’s theory that Kennedy was hit by only two shots which is absolutely necessary for their hypothesis. Lipsey did not seem to realize the import of his statement, however. Later in the interview, Lipsey questioned the HSCA interviewer about conspiracy, referring to Jack Ruby’s shooting of Oswald. Lipsey said, “...there’s something rotten in Denmark....” [82] This is comparable to a murder where the corpse is found dumped along the highway with a knife in the back, with the suspect’s fingerprints on the knife. One does not have to prove in which alley the stabbing took place."},{"pageNumber":671,"pageContent":" [83] The National Archives has released negatives of the autopsy x-rays; positive prints are included in Chapter 14. [84] Dr. Robert Livingston explained to me how cerebellar tissue is distinguished from other tissues of the brain. (Refer to Figure 13-8.) “The cerebellum is readily distinguished from cerebral cortical tissue because it has a surface of narrow parallel grooves, closely spaced at one or two millimeter intervals, whereas cerebral cortical tissue is relatively smooth. The cerebral convolutions, moreover, are broad, measured by several millimeters to a few centimeters in width.” Dr. Livingston is a recently retired Professor of Neuroscience who taught nervous system structure and function in medical schools at Stanford, Yale, Harvard, UCLA, and UCSD. He completed medical training and a residency in Internal Medicine at Stanford, and conducted advanced neuroscience research at the Universities of Geneva, Zurich, Collége de France, Oxford, Göteborg, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He founded and directed the hospital for wounded Okinawans and Japanese prisoners of war during the battle for Okinawa, served on NASA’s First Life Sciences Committee, was Scientific Director (concurrently) for the National Institute for Mental Health and the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness, and was the first National Scholar at the National Library of Medicine. [85] Dr. William Kemp Clark is a neurosurgeon—an expert in brain anatomy and therefore of its appearance in an opened skull. [86] The fact that the brain was severely mutilated is supported in a document that Anna Marie obtained from the National Archives. It is an HSCA memo of an interview (by Colleen Boland) of the autopsy physician J. Thornton Boswell on August 16, 1977. Present at the interview were Jim Kelly and Andrew Purdy of the HSCA. The interview quotes Dr. Boswell as saying, “ Boswell believes that the brain was so torn up it would not have shown a tract. ” [ Author’s note: Could this have been the brain that Curtis Jenkins was handed?] It also quotes Dr. Boswell saying that “JFK’s brain was kept in a chrome bucket in Captain Stover’s closet at Bethesda Naval Hospital, unguarded for days after the autopsy.” Another recently released document completes the circle. In an HSCA interview in 1977, C. H. Bowers, who was present at the autopsy and who also examined sections of the brain, wrote in his notes (handwritten copy): “2 December 1963—we received sections of brain from A63-272. These were processed and sent to CDR Humes’ office. I noted while cutting the tissue there is a definite picture of the way the missile passed. A pencil effect, i.e., push a pencil through a piece of paper and note the results. ” This is in contradiction with the observation of Dr. Boswell but is in substantial agreement with the drawing of the photograph of the brain in Exhibit 13-8. Why the contradiction? One obvious answer is that Dr. Boswell was observing JFK’s brain and C. H. Bowers was observing sections from a substitute brain. (Emphasis added) [87] Crenshaw, JFK: Conspiracy of Silence, p. 86 [88] Excerpt from a transcript of Dr. Livingston’s presentation, which he provided to me. [89] The dates and events concerning the autopsy materials are found in HSCA Volume VII, pp. 23-27 and NARA 10087-1042, September 6, 1977. [90] Murder in Dealey Plaza, p. 299"},{"pageNumber":672,"pageContent":" [91] Sibert’s memory seems to have modified over the years, a common occurrence of some witnesses. In 1966, three years after his and O’Neill’s report, he told David Lifton that “I’d swear on a stack of bibles that the doctors said there was surgery” ( Fourth Decade, Sept. 1994, p. 33). Twelve years later, in 1978, Sibert would elaborate on this statement, in an interview with the HSCA. “In reference to the head wound, I was present when the piece of missing bone was brought in during the course of the autopsy. This piece had reportedly been found in the limousine in which the President was riding. This piece of bone was x-rayed and doctors determined it had evidence of metal particles. When the body was first observed on the autopsy table, it was thought by the doctors that surgery had possibly been performed in the head area and such was reflected in my notes made at the time. However, this was determined not to be correct following detailed inspection and when the piece of bone found in the limousine was brought to the autopsy room during the latter stages of the autopsy.” If we accept Sibert’s HSCA interview as his best reconstruction of what happened, then the “surgery on the head” statement in his initial report would be discounted. However, why did not Sibert put this important item in his initial report? And why was Dr. Humes still puzzled about surgery on the head the next day when he phoned Dr. Perry? These questions, combined with all of the other evidence that the brain was either completely or partially removed by the conspirators, leads me to give credence to the original FBI report, and not to a rationalization twelve years later. [92] W.C. Vol. VI, p.6 [93] Lifton, p. 316 [94] Walter Cronkite, the nation’s icon of wisdom and balance, dwelled on this and other issues in a PBS Nova documentary that first aired in 1988, followed by every year since. I have viewed that program many times and concluded that I will not try to deal with its errors and distortions except for one item. In the Nova documentary, four of the Dallas hospital doctors, acting as consultants for Nova, were brought to Washington, D.C., to view the autopsy pictures and x-rays in the National Archives. These doctors were Dulany, Jenkins, Peters, and McClelland. For the first time they saw the photographs and x- rays. All of them earlier had said that when they observed Kennedy’s body at Parkland Hospital they saw a large wound in the rear of his head. Nova permitted them to enter the viewing room for the photos and x- rays, each for about one-half hour. When they emerged from the room they said they had seen no evidence that the wounds had been altered. We should keep in mind that this was twenty-five years after their first testimonies. How can we explain this? One answer is from Dr. McClelland, who later stated that the program was a setup. He restated his consistent past statements that the photographs did not agree with what he saw—a large hole in the back of the head. As for Drs. Dulany, Jenkins, and Peters, years earlier they had all clearly stated that there was a large hole in the back of the head. Perhaps they were intimidated or confused by seeing the autopsy photos in total for the first time in 1988. In any event, their earlier testimonies are inherently more credible than later vague statements under pressure. We must remember that for the doctors to accept that the autopsy photos were not what they had seen at Parkland Hospital, and so announce on national television, would have been tantamount to accusing the government of involvement in a cover-up of the conspiracy. It is understandable that some may not have wished to place themselves in such a storm of controversy. The Nova program, from beginning to end, despite Walter Cronkite’s good intentions, is flawed with faulty reasoning and incomplete evidence. Cronkite, in his attempt to be balanced, makes the mistake of presenting the evidence for conspiracy in a greatly simplified form, then presenting remotely possible"},{"pageNumber":673,"pageContent":"doubts that can always be raised for any evidence, no matter how powerful it is. Cronkite then concludes, one by one, for each item, that there isn’t proof of conspiracy “beyond a shadow of a doubt”—an impossibility for any evidence, as legal scholars and trial attorneys know only too well. Oh, how Walter Cronkite plays into the hands of those who have a need to deny the truth! He studied the JFK assassination perhaps harder and longer than any other network newsperson. I wonder if he realizes how much good he could have accomplished for our nation, if only he had come down strongly on what, in my judgment of his intelligence and reasoning power, he must have genuinely, deeply suspected—that a very sinister conspiracy assassinated his president. [95] Dr. Livingston has considerable experience in bullet wounds, having cared for hundreds of bullet and shrapnel wounds in his service in the U.S. Naval Medical Corps during the battle of Okinawa in World War II. [96] Autopsy report, p. 3., and Warren Commission Exhibit 387; also Warren Commission Exhibit 397, Dr. Humes’ handwritten notes concerning his telephone conversation on November 23, 1963 with Dr. Malcolm Perry, in which Perry describes a puncture wound in the anterior (front of) neck; Humes wrote that Dr. Perry said that he incised the puncture wound for a tracheotomy. [97] Dr. Mantik was chairman of the Cancer Committee at Eisenhower Hospital (a rotating chair) and practices in the Peter Lake Center of Eisenhower Hospital in Rancho Mirage. As a practicing radiation oncologist, he is engaged daily as a practitioner of x-ray techniques and technology to examine cancer patients for life-and-death diagnoses. In this practice, he became intimately familiar with the practical application of the science of optical densitometry for interpreting x-rays and, more specifically, for detecting and measuring the dimensions and physical characteristics of tumors in patients. This combination of practical experience and academic training, along with the fact that Dr. Mantik has a Ph.D. in physics (in addition to his degrees in medicine), uniquely qualifies him to speak about the x-rays of John F. Kennedy and the autopsy following his murder. Moreover, Dr. Mantik has the courage and love of country to challenge the orthodoxy, while still working in the establishment mainstream. [98] The use of optical densitometry for measurement of the dimensions, mass, and density of objects (such as tumors, tissues, and bone) in x-ray films has been developed over the years to an empirical science, with a large body of information available in the medical literature to facilitate reasonably precise calculations and interpretations. [99] A typical skull thickness varies from about 1/4 inch to about 1/2 inch; therefore, I will use 3/8 inch as an average. [100] A typical male skull measures 5 inches by 7 inches in a horizontal cross-section. I will use an average of 6 inches for simplification. [101] The HSCA appointed a panel of experts who concluded that the autopsy x-rays (and photographs) are all authentic. That conclusion boggles the mind in light of the evidence presented in this chapter. It should be noted that none of the experts on the panel made optical densitometer measurements of the x-rays, as did Dr. David Mantik. [102] In June 1995, after a visit to the National Archives, Dr. Mantik encountered a stumbling block in his concept of x-ray composite forgeries, which led him to temporarily believe that it was not possible to forge x-ray film using composites, due to the impossibility (he then thought) of achieving more than an"},{"pageNumber":674,"pageContent":"optical density of 2.0 in the composite x-ray, whereas the optical density in the Kennedy x-rays approached 4.0 in area F and in the background. In an interim memorandum, and then in a presentation at the COPA Conference in Washington, D.C., in October 1994, he presented these issues—an unusual display of candor, openness, and honesty to say the least! But with technical information he received from Eastman Kodak Company, he then went back to his laboratory and found that it was indeed possible to make a composite forgery of an x-ray and achieve the optical densities that he had measured in the Kennedy x-rays. (I will not go into the technical details here, as it is beyond the scope of this book.) Dr. Mantik presented this update at the COPA Conference in Washington, D.C., on October 21, 1995, but unfortunately not everyone has since gotten the word. Hopefully, this footnote will help set the matter straight until Dr. Mantik publishes his work. (As a full-time, practicing physician, Dr. Mantik does have limitations on the amount of time he can spend on this subject.) [103] The blow-out in the back of the head would not show in the side view in the Zapruder film if only two or three frames were removed to delete that event. But a blow-out in the side of the head is another matter, because removal of a large number of frames (enough to remove the entire view of the side of the head) would have been required, impossible to conceal. [104] One remote possibility that has been offered to challenge this conclusion is that the bone under the scalp might have separated from it, as a result of a frontal bullet wound, in such a way that a disruption in the external appearance of the hair and scalp was not discernible in the Zapruder film. I find this notion to be extremely implausible, to say the least. [105] The mean transmission measured in area P by Dr. Mantik was 23.7%, whereas that measured in area F was 0.020%, a ratio of 1130:1. This compares to an average ratio of area P to F of 1.37:1 in nine coroner’s cases that Dr. Mantik studied. [106] According to an entry in the attorney general’s calendar on May 7, 1962, Robert Kennedy probably learned of the Mafia connection in a meeting with Richard Helms on that date. He then met with J. Edgar Hoover on May 9, 1962, and Hoover prepared a memorandum recounting what was said at the May 7 meeting. On May 11, Robert Kennedy asked Sheffield Edwards to prepare a memorandum (dated May 14, 1962) relating what had transpired in the May 7 meeting. Edwards prepared the memorandum with the assistance of Lawrence Houston. Houston later testified that Kennedy was upset that the CIA had used Giancana. Houston recalled that Kennedy had said in very specific terms that “if we were going to get involved with Mafia personnel again he wanted to be informed first.” Houston said that he did not remember Kennedy commenting about the operation itself.

At the time of his arrest, he confessed to killing JFK, but later recanted. He is now in a federal penitentiary and is not talking. He strongly resembles photographs of a tramp arrested and released at Dealey Plaza. [154] There is considerable doubt about the reliability of the story involving White, Tippit, and Sturgis as the gunmen [155] According to one of my psychoanalytical advisers, it is true that even gangsters (some gangsters) can have a conscience, particularly if it involves country or family, thus violating their code of honor [156] An irony is that confessions are discredited if they fit too neatly into already public information. Presumably, if all the details are public, no confession could ever be believed without irrefutable scientific evidence. [157] Frank Ragano and Selwyn Raab, Mob Lawyer, pp. 324, 325 [158] Before his testimony, Aleman expressed fear of retaliation from Trafficante for his statements. He ludicrously hedged at one point, saying that Trafficante may have meant that Kennedy was going to be “hit by a lot of Republican votes.” Also, Aleman testified that the conversation must have occurred in June 1963; the consensus of the Committee was September 1962.

Summers said he is convinced that Ragano’s story about Trafficante is not true. Ragano said in his book that he met with Trafficante on March 13, 1987. Yet Trafficante’s widow, two daughters, and several neighbors say the meeting with Ragano never happened, based on their recollection that Santo had not visited Tampa since the Christmas holidays. Ragano later said that he was telling the truth and that he has three witnesses to prove it. The final story on this incident will perhaps remain in doubt because of Summer’s article, but is it reasonable doubt? Was Ragano correct in his statements of Santo’s confessions and simply got the date wrong? Shall we believe Trafficante’s lawyer, and accept the opinion of Robert Blakey, chief counsel of the HSCA, or shall we believe Santo’s wife, children, and neighbors? In any case, even if we discount Ragano’s story of the alleged Trafficante confession completely, there remains powerful evidence that Trafficante knew of the assassination plot beforehand, that he had ample motive, and was involved with Jimmy Hoffa and Carlos Marcello in planning the death of John F. Kennedy.

Also, read Operation Zapata, the report prepared by a committee chaired by General Maxwell Taylor for John Kennedy to assess the reasons for the Bay of Pigs failure. [172] Another man who was enraged by Kennedy’s handling of the Bay of Pigs was David Sanchez Morales, the CIA’s top executive action (assassination) man, who was flying above the operation, seeing his Cuban comrades being slaughtered on the beach. Morales would later become a prime suspect as the man who directed the field operation in the JFK assassination. More on that in later chapters.

An unanswered question: Who financed Oswald? Was it the U.S. or was it the Soviets? Or was it someone else? [197] One of Oswald’s favorite stories was “ I Led Three Lives ,” about a double agent. At the age of sixteen, he studied Marxism and wrote a letter avowing that he was a Marxist. [198] Peter Dale Scott has recently suggested that Oswald could have been in Russia on a mission related to a very elaborate mole hunt in which Oswald was used as a repository of false identifications in CIA files that would reveal a Soviet mole in the CIA (the “bent card trick”). [199] This trip is viewed with suspicion: There was no scheduled airline flight from England to Helsinki that would have permitted Oswald to arrive in Helsinki by midnight on October 9. Only by private or military aircraft could he have made that flight (Fonzi, pp. 31-32). [200] We should keep in mind that Hoover may have been part of an orchestrated disinformation scheme fed to the Warren Commission to connect Oswald ominously to the Soviets. [201] The Dallas Morning News reported on July 9, 1976 and March 17, 1977 that General Walker was arrested in Dallas on two different occasions for “public lewdness.” Police reports allege that Walker followed undercover policemen into a public restroom and made physical advances to the officers on both occasions. .

LEGAT is a code for FBI representatives at the U.S. embassy in Mexico City. [242] Author’s Note: Yuri Gagarin appeared in Mexico City on October 11, 1963 (Nechiporenko, p. 84). [243] Elena Garro never appeared, despite a date scheduled. [244] Author’s Note: In a later CIA cable from CIA’s John Scelso in Mexico City, dated November 28, 1963 (to a list including McGeorge Bundy in the White House), Alvarado identified the pretty girl as Luisa Calderon (CIA Record number 104-10015-10442). The fact that the White House was aware of the Alvarado story is significant. Also, McGeorge Bundy was close to Robert Kennedy. I have noticed on other CIA documents that McGeorge Bundy was on the distribution list. This includes the original cable traffic concerning keeping the Duran interrogation secret from the American people. At that time, Bundy was reporting directly to Lyndon Johnson. All of this is documented evidence that Lyndon Johnson was getting up-to-date information on the Mexico City evidence and that, apparently, the CIA was not concealing anything from him. One might also presume that Bundy was keeping Robert Kennedy informed. (See Epilogue at the end of this chapter for recent important document concerning John Scelso) [245] Author’s Note: When questioned by the FBI, the U.S. embassy said that it had no knowledge or records of these telephone calls by Alvarado. [246] Author’s Note: The words “respond to suggestion” and “psychiatric treatment” remind one of hypnosis and mind-control methods employed by the CIA in that era. [247] HSCA, Mark A. Allen, Summary of Research in National Archives and files of Bernard Fensterwald on November 12, 1975 [248] I talked with Gaeton Fonzi about this. He said that the Nicaraguan secret service was under the control of the CIA at the time. [249] It should be noted that this was over the strong objections of Thomas Mann, U.S. ambassador to Mexico. Ambassador Mann pointed out the detail in the Alvarado story, stating that it was very believable. Ultimately, Washington prevailed, and the evidence was suppressed.

[250] Station’s Double Agents have not had meetings with the Soviets since the assassination. [251] Church Committee Report, pp. 182, 183, citing Inspector Generals’s Report p. 37 [252] J. Edgar Hoover began to learn about the CIA/Mafia connections very soon; he had placed wiretaps on Sam Giancana and his associates. In a memorandum dated October 18, 1960 sent to Allan Dulles, Hoover wrote: “According to the source, during recent conversation with several friends, Giancana stated that Fidel Castro was to be done away with very shortly. When doubt was expressed regarding this statement Giancana reportedly assured those present that Castro’s assassination would occur in November. Moreover, he allegedly indicated that he had already met with the assassin-to-be on three occasions, the last meeting taking place on a boat docked at the Fontainbleau Hotel, Miami Beach, Florida. Reportedly, Giancana claimed that everything has been perfected for the killing of Castro and that the ‘assassin’ had arranged with a girl, not further described, to drop a ‘pill’ in some drink or food of Castro’s.” Within seven months after this memo, Hoover knew of the mob’s arrangement with the CIA and the plots against Castro. On May 22, 1961, Hoover sent a memorandum to Robert Kennedy which stated: “Colonel [Sheffield] Edwards advised that in connection with CIA’s operation against Castro he personally contacted Robert Maheu...for the purpose of using Maheu as a cutout in contacts with Sam Giancana.... Giancana gave every indication of cooperating through Maheu in attempting to accomplish several clandestine efforts in Cuba....” (Church Committee Report, pp. 328-330) The significance of this in the JFK assassination is that Hoover knew very early about CIA dirty business with the Mafia. In a previous chapter, I wrote that Hoover knew about Oswald and CIA connections while Oswald was in Russia; thus Hoover would have seen the opportunity to set up Oswald and the CIA in a plot to kill Kennedy. Hoover’s knowledge of the CIA/Mafia plots would have emboldened him even more because he would have known that the CIA would be forced to keep quiet and cover up the president’s assassination for fear of exposure of their “black operations.” (The compulsion of the CIA to immediately go into a cover-up mode is evidenced to this day. In 1995, the CIA made major efforts to cover up the relatively innocuous fact [compared to the JFK assassination] that they had a paid agent in Guatemala who had assassinated an American citizen.) [253] Inspector General’s Report, p. 131 [254] The CIA later participated in a successful coup in Chile: Salvador Allende was assassinated (on September 11, 1973). Allende was replaced by General Augusto Pinochet, the head of a military junta (Corn, Blond Ghost, pp. 264-265) [255] Church Committee Report, p. 182 [256] Charles Siragusa was with the FBN (Federal Bureau of Narcotics) at that time. It has been reported that Siragusa served in FBN in Europe, under deep cover, posing as a European criminal (Scott, Deep Politics and the Death of JFK, p. 352). Siragusa was also involved in the CIA’s mind-control programs. Scott speculates that Siragusa himself may have been QJ/WIN! This speculation is perhaps reinforced in typewritten notes found in the National Archives (document labeled 3480) which states: “Siragusa, Assistant Deputy Narcotics Commissioner, as source on Corsicans and Sicilians; query him whether District #2 (N.Y., N.J. and New England) has West Indian colored contacts suitable for our purposes. ”From this, it does seem possible, if not convincing, that Siragusa could have been recruited as"},{"pageNumber":685,"pageContent":"QJ/WIN, remained in the FBN, and handled an assignment by the CIA for recruiting assassins. An additional item is found in investigative journalist Steve Rivele’s notes on an interview with Roger Ardhouin, a radio correspondent in New York: Ardhouin told Rivele that he knew a Bureau of Narcotics’ agent in Marseilles in the early 1960s who was supposedly a CIA agent as well, charged with recruiting gangsters for the CIA. The agent’s name was Paul Higdon. Ardhouin said that Higdon recruited from the Guerini mob for the CIA. Is Higdon another suspect for QJ/WIN? Or was Higdon working with Siragusa who was QJ/WIN? [257] AARC—CIA document #632-796 for FOIA review June 1976 [258] The FBI claimed that it did not contact Alderson until March 1964, presumably after receiving the information from the French. Yet, if Alderson is correct, the FBI knew, on its own, about Souetre very soon after the assassination and attempted to conceal it. Researchers believe there is no reason not to believe Alderson, who had no reason to lie about the matter. This leads to the suspicion that the FBI never would have left a paper trail of its prior knowledge of Souetre had it not been forced to do so by the formal notification from the French. This is another example of the FBI covering up vital evidence. It should be noted that none of this evidence was made available by Hoover to the Warren Commission, although the FBI clearly had it in its possession before the completion of the Warren Report.

Anthony Summers wrote: For those who wish to see no further progress in the Kennedy case, a much-trumpeted British television program, produced in November 1988 by Central T.V., was a welcome event. Among its many follies, the program named as Gunman Two and Gunman Three two men whose names had come up during Rivele’s discussions with David, but who David had since specifically said were innocent. In the wake of the television program, one of the men produced a plausible alibi for November 22, and Rivele’s exclusive story suddenly appeared—however unjustifiably—to have been exploded. Rivele’s French publishers backed off, and no American publisher had been found as this book went to press. Rivele himself, disgusted with the Central T.V. fiasco, weary from years of non-stop investigation, turned to other work. (Summers, Conspiracy , p. 526). Assassination researchers who were eager to see Rivele’s work discredited seized upon this to throw out Christian David’s entire story as a pack of lies to get himself out of prison. But I urge the reader to suspend judgment until this segment is completed, and reasons to believe David’s story are evaluated. [271] Author’s Note : The picking up of the assassins on the Texas border by the Chicago Mafia was also reported in the Sam and Chuck Giancana book Double Cross . See Chapter 15 [272] Author’s Note: Possible corroboration of David’s statement here is found in the Church Committee Report (p. 46). The CIA Station Officer at Leopoldville in the Congo sent the following cable: “QJ/WIN who resides same hotel as WI/ROGUE reported *** WI/ROGUE smelled as though he in Intel business. Station denied any infor on WI/ROGUE. 14 Dec QJ/WIN reported WI/ROGUE had offered him three hundred dollars per month to participate in Intel net and be member ‘execution squad.’ When QJ/WIN said he not interested, WI/ROGUE added there would be bonuses for special jobs. Under QJ/WIN questioning, WI/ROGUE later said he working for [American] service. *** In discussing local contacts, WI/ROGUE mentioned QJ/WIN but did not admit to having tried recruit him. When [Station Officer] tried learn whether WI/ROGUE had made approach latter claimed had taken no steps. [Station Officer] was unable contradict, as did not wish reveal QJ/WIN connection [with CIA].” (CIA Cable, Leopoldville to Director, 12/17/60) This suggests that Christian David was WI/ROGUE; also that he contacted QJ/WIN in Leopoldville, whom he had not yet met, on December 17, 1960. In any event, David was knowledgeable of the CIA operation to kill Lumumba in the Congo. [273] Author’s Note : This could be significant. Both QJ/WIN and WI/ROGUE were in the Congo in 1963. Although this implies that perhaps Lucien Sarti was QJ/WIN, it seems very unlikely since Sarti was too young. Of course, David, Sarti, and QJ/WIN could all have been in the Congo assigned to the Lumumba assassination, as well as later becoming involved in the Kennedy assassination. [274] Author’s Note : Christian David’s description of the gunshots fits the evidence if the back wound was an entry wound at the base of the neck, resulting in an exit wound in the throat. However this would have required a very low position (street level) for the gunman in the rear, and still does not seem to adequately fit the location of the bullet holes in Kennedy’s jacket and shirt, which were six inches below the collar line. We should keep in mind that we do not, to this day, understand Kennedy’s wounds because of forgery of films and alteration of autopsy results. Therefore, David’s statements could be valid. On the other hand, David could have constructed his own Dealey Plaza scenario from books available in 1986.

The Soviets knew about it before “the first spade had been put in the ground,” having been kept current on the project by George Blake, a Soviet mole in British intelligence. The Soviets had transmitted only innocuous information over the cables (Nechiporenko, pp. 5-6) [286] It is not clear that Harvey had gone to Italy before June 1963. The Inspector General’s Report states that when Harvey met Rosselli in Washington in June 1963, he had by then closed his home in preparation for leaving the country. It is possible, however, that Harvey had gone to Rome, returned to Washington to close his home, and then gone back to Rome. ( Inspector General’s Report p. 53) [287] Anthony Summers, Conspiracy, p. 529 [288] Anthony Summers, Conspiracy , pp. iii-iv [289] JM/WAVE had 400 CIA case officers.

Ted Shackley was chief of station, Ray Cline was deputy to Shackley, David Morales was chief of operations. David Atlee Phillips was assigned part-time to JM/WAVE (his specialty was disinformation—communications and coup d’etats) [290] Gaeton Fonzi, The Last Investigation, p. 422 [291] It was also interesting that Ayers wrote that, after John Kennedy was assassinated and Lyndon Johnson became president, all efforts to assist Ayers’ group ceased. Perhaps Vietnam was LBJ’s priority, or he simply wouldn’t continue anything that Robert Kennedy had been pursuing as a priority. This again raises the question of whether the prime motive for the assassination was to trigger an invasion of Cuba; or whether the Cuban/Mexico City set-up was a false trail to lead investigators away from the real conspirators, whose motive was to get rid of the Kennedys and preserve their own power and freedom. [292] Rosselli, along with others, concocted a scheme wherein a cohort, hidden in a space above the card room at the Friars Club, looked through a peephole drilled in the ceiling. The cohort would relay radio messages to others at the card table who had radio receivers strapped to their stomachs. When the scam was uncovered, Rosselli was indicted, convicted, and sentenced to five years in the federal penitentiary at McNeil Island. He served from February 22, 1971 to October 5, 1973. It was on July 18, 1976 that Rosselli had finally talked too much about the JFK assassination and was dismembered and disposed of in an oil drum in the Florida waterways. (Rappleye and Becker, All American Mafioso, pp. 287-291, 315) [293] Another connection to the Friars Club later occurred to me: Richard Case Nagell had mentioned to Dick Russell that he had once met Johnny Rosselli at the Friars Club. Nagell is the CIA agent in The Man Who Knew Too Much , Russell’s book. Nagell was very much involved in the JFK assassination. I later learned from a close relative of Nagell that Nagell had met with Sam Giancana and Jimmy Hoffa in New York (see Chapter 26). [294] This biographical and character sketch of Morales is my synthesis of salient items from a variety of sources: Gaeton Fonzi, The Last Investigation ; David Corn, Blond Ghost : Ted Shackley and the CIA’s Crusades ; Charles Rappleye and Ed Becker, All American Mafioso: The Johnny Rosselli Story ; Bradley Ayers, The War That Never Was ; also, my own interviews, and Bob Dorff’s interviews, with Robert Walton and Ruben Carbajal; and my discussions with Wayne Smith. [295] Fonzi, The Last Investigation, p. 379 (from government records); also statement of an anonymous retired colonel “Charles Crest” interviewed by Bob Dorff (Dorff’s notes 3/19/93). Crest told Dorff he was in Vietnam with Morales in 1964, in the Phoenix Program. Crest also said that he had first met Morales in the Belgian Congo in 1960-1961. This potentially links Morales to WI/ROGUE, QJ/WIN, Christian David, and Lucien Sarti! [296] David Corn, Blond Ghost : Ted Shackley and the CIA’s Crusades, p. 85 [297] In his affidavit (11-3-89), Ayers provided this description of Morales: David Morales, at the time I knew him, was about 6’23, portly and reflecting a heavy drinking habit. He was foul tempered, suspicious of all but a few staff members and extremely protective of his turf as Operations Chief. There was constant friction between Bob Wall and Morales but Morales held sway with Shackley and dominated the entire operational agenda at the Station."},{"pageNumber":689,"pageContent":" I have vague recollection of David Morales being away from the Miami Station for extended periods (2 to 7 days) when Bob Wall would serve as the (acting) Chief of Operations. Then, his “absence” would often be explained by someone in the section or by a secretary as “Dave is in Mexico.” It is my opinion that Morales’ frequent absence was a source of conflict between Wall and Morales. Further, Morales was often demonstrably irritated with changes to planned JMWAVE covert/paramilitary operations that were handed down by CIA headquarters at Langley or by orders from the Special Group that seemed to be micro-managing the secret war against Castro. [298] According to Rappleye and Becker in American Mafioso , Rosselli worked on Castro assassinations under Harvey and Morales until February 1963. It was two to four months after this that Bradley Ayers saw Harvey, Morales, and Rosselli together in the Florida Keys. [299] This was probably Edwin Wilson, the renegade CIA man recently released from prison for selling arms to Libya [300] According to researcher Bob Dorff, Robert Walton first revealed this story in 1989 or 1990 to Bradley Ayers. The story was not published until Fonzi’s book was published in 1994 [301] If Walton is correct on this date, the “leader” would have been General Rene Schneider, who was assassinated in 1970. Nixon authorized the $10,000,000 in 1970 to “prevent Allende’s ascension to office.” General Schneider was assassinated in 1970, shortly after the $10,000,000 was authorized; Allende was assassinated in 1973. (Church Committee, pp. 228-246. Also see Chapter 20.) [302] Ruben Carbajal told Bob Dorff (and he later told me) that he believes unequivocally that the CIA killed Morales. It should be noted, however, that Carbajal did say that Morales had received a diagnosis of a minor enlarged heart at one time in his life, but there had never been any overt symptoms. [303] When Robert Walton reviewed this transcript, he requested that I note that his experience with Morales as related to the JFK assassination occurred when he was a business partner of Morales, not when he was Morales’ attorney. Therefore Walton did not feel that he was violating any attorney/client relationship in telling this story. [304] Nixon’s authorization of $10 million was reported in the Church Committee Report (p. 288): The following day, September 16, Director Helms called a meeting at the CIA to discuss the Chilean situation. At this meeting, he related to his colleagues his understanding of the President’s instructions: The Director told the group that President Nixon had decided that an Allende regime in Chile was unacceptable to the United States. The President asked the Agency to prevent Allende from coming to power or to unseat him. The President authorized $10,000,000 for this purpose, if needed. Further, the Agency is to carry out this mission without coordination with the Departments of State or Defense. (Memorandum/Genesis of the Project, 9/16/70) [305] Summers, Conspiracy, p. 594n (source note #313) [306] Peter Noyes, Legacy of Doubt , pp. 157-160 [307] Charles Rappleye and Ed Becker, All American Mafioso: The Johnny Rosselli Story, p. 245 [308] This has to do with the Tupamaros, an urban guerilla organization active in Uruguay in the 1960s and early ’70s. Formed in 1963, they began robbing banks to aid the poor, but later resorted to"},{"pageNumber":690,"pageContent":"terrorism in an effort to overthrow the government and set up a Marxist state. In 1972 the Uruguayan government declared “internal war” against the organization, and by the end of 1973 the organization had essentially been crushed (Microsoft Encarta, 1994). The timing (197273) is consistent with Morales’s alleged involvement in South America in the Salvador Allende assassination (1973) and the earlier assassination of Che Guevara (1967). [309] Asuncion is the capitol of Paraguay. [310] Bob Dorff recently told me that Morales’s gravestone shows him as a sergeant [311] My limited knowledge of right-wing extremist organizations in 1963 had an eerie replay in 1995 when two right-wing extremists were arrested for bombing the federal office building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 men, women, and children. Within two days after the bombing, the FBI had picked up a young man who was connected with a right-wing extremist group called the Michigan Militia. To my surprise, that militia was one of 300 or so groups, with names like White Aryan Resistance, The Order of Aryan Nations, The Arizona Patriots, and (still) The Minutemen. The Los Angeles Times reported that these organizations had “sprung up over the last decade.” But these types of right-wing extremist organizations had not just “sprung up”; they had been in existence since before 1963, perhaps becoming dormant in the interim. While seemingly new, their origins were in the Ku Klux Klan and Nazi-like movements. For the most part their themes were similar to what they were in 1963: hatred of federal government; violent opposition to gun control laws; paranoid fear of external forces taking over the United States; Christian fundamentalist hate rhetoric against President Clinton (similar to that against President Kennedy in 1963); weekend military exercises; white supremacy, and anti-semitism. Many of their recruits were ex-military officers and enlisted men. The extremists had aligned themselves with numerous members of Congress in 1995, as in 1963. (To a lesser extent in 1995.) But new targets of the extremists in 1995 were the FBI and federal law enforcement in general. They were admirers of J. Edgar Hoover in 1963. Similar to 1963, some of the religious right wing and right-wing extremist radio talk shows fanned the flames of paranoia in continuous diatribes against President Clinton. As was the case with John Kennedy, President Clinton was demonized. In the months preceding the Oklahoma City bombing, fanatics had made two attacks on the presidency, one in the form of a small plane diving into the White House; and the other in the form of an extremist who opened fire with an assault rifle on the White House from Pennsylvania Avenue. Another disturbed man had climbed over the White House fence with an unloaded pistol and was shot and wounded. Another man was shot and killed when he brandished a knife in front of the White House. [312] Ruth and Michael Paine have been considered liberals by many researchers, although there are some who believe that they worked for a government agency, possibly the CIA. [313] In a conversation with Dick Russell, General Walker denied that this incident occurred; but the fact remains that the newspaper had called him all the way from Germany the morning after the assassination and did print the story before anyone could have known that Oswald was a suspect in the Walker shooting. [314] I should add that if ever extremism was justified, it was in the case of the people in the anti- Castro movement in Florida. After all, Castro had seized their businesses—fruits of their lifetime labor— forcing them into exile and imprisoning their families. "},{"pageNumber":691,"pageContent":"[315] L.

Fletcher Prouty, JFK: The CIA, Vietnam, and the Plot to Assassinate John F. Kennedy, p. xxxiii. [322] General Charles Willoughby will be discussed in later chapters. He was an extreme right-wing general in charge of military intelligence for General Douglas MacArthur in the Pacific theatre during the Korean War, and was a rival of the CIA. After retirement, Willoughby became closely associated with oil billionaire H. L. Hunt. (Cumings, pp. 105, 123) [323] Murchison had received large loans from Hoffa’s Teamsters Union, thus indirectly connecting him to the Mafia. And Murchison had direct financial ties to mobsters Vito Genovese and Carlos Marcello and was linked to the Bobby Baker scandal. (Summers, Official and Confidential , p. 233) [324] Newman wrote in his book that Lyndon Johnson had provided the CIA with “back channels” (information) about John Kennedy’s personal escapades and the “true” status of the Vietnam war, information Kennedy did not have. [325] The participants in the Honolulu conference included Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, CIA Director John McCone, NSC Advisor McGeorge Bundy, Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Under Secretary of State George Ball, Vietnam Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Maxwell Taylor, General Paul Harkins, and Admiral Harry Felt. The purpose of the conference was to conduct a major assessment of the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, and to prepare recommendations to the president for a continuing program. McGeorge Bundy prepared a directive— NSAM 273—which ultimately was approved by Lyndon Johnson. In his book JFK and Vietnam, John Newman contends that NSAM 273 was changed to reflect a more aggressive, escalating posture in the conduct of the war than did the first draft of that memorandum prepared by McGeorge Bundy immediately after the conference. (Newman, JFK and Vietnam, p. 430; also P. D. Scott, Deep Politics , pp. 24-28.) One of the more extreme speculations ( not by Newman or Scott) about the Kennedy assassination has been that the Honolulu conference itself was part of a master plot to send the key members of Kennedy’s administration out of the country while he was assassinated. This hypothesis included the notion that with"},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"these people out of the country, the stage would be set for a complete coup and takeover of the government by the U.S. military if things went so wrong that it would be needed. From the research I have done, this appears to be utter speculation, without merit. It should be noted that Robert McNamara had returned to Washington, D.C., by the time of the assassination. [326] In his book In Retrospect , McNamara expanded on this issue: ....National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 273 incorporated the president’s directives into policy. It made clear that Johnson’s policy remained the same as Kennedy’s: “to assist the people and Government of South Vietnam to win their contest against the externally directed and supported Communist conspiracy” through training support and without the application of overt U.S. military force. But Johnson also approved planning for covert action against North Vietnam by CIA-supported South Vietnamese forces. First raised at the November 20, 1963, Honolulu conference, this proposal later became known as Operation Plan 34A. McNamara, pp. 102-103 (Emphasis added) It thus seems that NSAM 273 was changed to “escalate” the war, but not necessarily in a sinister way . Rather, it was a final product of the November 20 Honolulu conference, the results of which were never reported to Kennedy because he was killed two days before anyone who had attended the conference could speak with him. There is no way to know whether Kennedy would have approved the change, but we do know that Johnson did. Insofar as Johnson escalating the war, McNamara wrote: Johnson felt more certain than President Kennedy that the loss of South Vietnam had a higher cost than would the direct application of U.S. military force, and it was this view that shaped him and his policy decisions for the next five years. He failed to perceive the fundamentally political nature of the war.... ...President Johnson made clear to Lodge on November 24 that he wanted to win the war,and that, at least in the short run, he wanted priority given to military operations over “so-called” social reforms. He felt the United States had spent too much time and energy trying to shape other countries in its own image. Win the war! That was his message. McNamara, p. 102 (Emphasis added) An important historical issue is at stake here. From McNamara’s perspective, Johnson continued Kennedy’s policies, albeit with a greater emphasis on winning the war. But seemingly, from my interpretation of the perspectives of Newman and Prouty, the changes in NSAM 273 could have been a deliberate, manipulative action to escalate the war. I may be Pollyanna-ish here, but I am inclined to believe a non-sinister version, i.e., any changes made in NSAM 273 were only a final distillation or consensus of the Honolulu conference, although they did recommend, in fact, stronger covert action. We should also keep in mind that there were hawk and dove factions in the Kennedy administration, and that with Johnson now at the helm, the hawks would prevail. One more point: Even if McNamara and the doves had persuaded Kennedy to adopt the policy of early withdrawal from Vietnam, we cannot be certain that Kennedy was committed deeply to it. And, of course, early withdrawal from Vietnam made good politics for the upcoming election. [327] This issue requires clarification: According to the report prepared by a board of inquiry headed by General Maxwell Taylor for President Kennedy (later published in the book Operation Zapata ), only one air strike was withheld. This was a second air strike requested by the CIA to destroy three remaining Cuban fighter planes that had not been taken out in a first planned air strike that had been designed so it would not appear to be conducted by U.S. forces. Upon the urgings of the State Department, Kennedy (and McNamara) refused to approve the second strike because it would have revealed U.S. involvement. It was McGeorge Bundy who relayed this refusal to the military and the CIA. (Some writers, Fletcher Prouty included, have speculated that Bundy deliberately told the CIA a"},{"pageNumber":693,"pageContent":"fabricated story that JFK had disapproved the air stikes. According to McNamara, this would be patently untrue, because JFK and he had, in fact, disapproved the air strikes.) In Operation Zapata, Bundy wrote a letter to Maxwell Taylor stating that he (Bundy) had given the order refusing the air strike, but Bundy was ambiguous in his letter as to whether he received the decision from Kennedy. As described in my interview with McNamara, he clarified this important point . Also, Bundy wrote that the importance of the three fighter planes was never relayed to Kennedy by the CIA or the military, and that he (Bundy) had offered to have the military and the CIA speak directly to President Kennedy to try to change his mind, but they declined to do so. ( Operation Zapata , pp. 36-39, 178-180; also Prouty, JFK, pp. 130-132, 157-158) [328] The cutoff of supplies was explained in Operation Zapata (p. 36). The supply ships were sunk by the Cuban fighter planes that had not been taken out because of Kennedy’s refusal to allow the air strikes.

It shows that there was a follow-up meeting in which the subject was again reviewed. General Johnson, who made the presentation, then confirmed to Kennedy that even if the U.S. attacked the USSR first (in 1963), the loss to the U.S. would be unacceptable to political leaders. However, General Johnson did state that he was convinced from his report that you could resort to nuclear weapons in a limited situation without it expanding into all-out nuclear war. Although much of the summary of the meeting is deleted in the document, it is apparent that it had been decided that an opportunity for a first nuclear strike had passed, even in the eyes of the generals.

The group being held included: “Miró Cardona, with a son on the beachhead; Tony Varona, with a son, two brothers and two nephews; Antonio Maceo, with a son; Manuel Ray; Justo Carrillo; and Carlos Hevia.” Schlesinger wrote nothing of plans to eliminate them.

Report Vol. VIII, pp. 241, 242, 243 [554] Hemming told me that as a youth he wanted to get into U.S. Special Forces (later the Green Berets). He said this was in part his reason for joining Castro’s forces—to get experience. He infiltrated Cuba as an arms smuggler, bringing weapons that he had purportedly “stolen” from the U.S. Naval Academy armory. I suspect that this was set up for him by U.S. intelligence. Hemming also told me that he parachuted into Cuba during the 1961-1965 anti-Castro operations. [555] Hemming told me this story was inaccurate. One sporting goods store was burglarized twice to get their weapons. He said he posed for a photo wearing a Nazi Youth uniform only once as part of a plan to establish his cover as a right-wing youth for future use. (This was similar to Oswald’s perhaps posing as a Marxist as a teenager by reading Karl Marx.) [556] I suspect that this was another Hemming “cover” for CIA-sanctioned operations [557] When Hemming was arrested at Florida’s Lantana Airport in a drug-laden Beechcraft Bonanza, the police seized 728 pounds of marijuana and 177 pounds of methaqualone, or Quaaludes ( Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel, February 9, 1962)."},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":" [558] The transcripts of these interviews and notes (except the final draft) were given to Hemming for his comments prior to publication. He had told me in San Diego that not everything in the San Diego interview was from first-hand experience; some of it had been arrived at over the years in his own private investigations. The direct experience will generally be obvious. I have condensed and edited the transcripts to what you see here. [559] Lawrence (Laric or Larry) LaBorde figures prominently in the JFK assassination, according to Hemming, who describes LaBorde as a “plug-ugly cold blooded assassin.” A CIA document dated June 11, 1962 states that KUBARK (CIA) had used LaBorde in CIA operations since early 1961. The document states that LaBorde had formerly been employed by the Department of Agriculture (DOA) in Mexico from 1947 to 1949 as a small boat operator. Later, LaBorde acted as captain or chief engineer of a motor vessel called M/V Tejana III in CIA’s JM/WAVE operations against Cuba. During or after the end of this period, LaBorde became associated with the Cuban Revolutionary Council—Sergio Arcacha Smith’s operation officed in the same building in New Orleans with Guy Banister and Oswald. A. J. Weberman claims that Hemming murdered Larry LaBorde in 1981. I asked Hemming about this and he denied it, telling me “I would have liked to.” Another CIA document describes LaBorde as indiscreet, addicted to alcohol, of unsavory reputation. LaBorde is described as having become embittered with the CIA, at various times “berating the agency.” At the time of the JFK assassination, LaBorde was 52 years old [560] In later discussions (in Fort Lauderdale) I tried to clarify this statement. I told Hemming that it read as if he had accepted the offer to kill JFK. I asked him if he was certain that he wanted that impression to be conveyed. Hemming responded, somewhat upset, that he meant this to be a general statement regarding “tradecraft methods,” not that he had accepted the contract. [561] I later remembered that John Martino’s wife Florence had told Anthony Summers that her husband said, “Flo, do you remember that good-looking [Cuban] kid that was sitting on the couch? He was involved...He was one of them.” (Anthony Summers, Vanity Fair, December 1994, p. 112.) I wondered, who would that “good-looking kid” be? When I questioned Hemming on this in our last meeting in Fort Lauderdale, he said it was Ronald Ponce de Leon, one of the members of his Interpen group! (See photo in Chapter 28) More later on this. [562] Hemming and two of his associates (Roy Hargraves and Howard K. Davis) were hired as consultants by Oliver Stone for the movie JFK. Hemming told me that his role in the movie was one of the men on the sixth floor of the School Book Depository Building. This struck me as the ultimate irony. One must admit that Oliver Stone goes to great lengths to get realism in his movies, despite the criticism that has been heaped upon him. [563] Here we have an indication that Angleton may have found out about Oswald through Hemming. Author A. J. Weberman speculates that Angleton, on his own, sent Oswald to the Soviet Union, without anyone in the CIA outside of his counter-intelligence group knowing about it. As chief mole-hunter for the CIA, Angleton was chartered to be on his own. No one in the CIA had the power to control him, except possibly Allen Dulles, if even Dulles. Hemming says, however, that Oswald had earlier been successfully “dangled” to a Japanese-Soviet spy ring and later was one of four men sent to Russia to take blame for the shoot-down of the U.S. U-2 plane on May 1, 1960. [564] An FBI report dated January 8, 1963 described Hemming and his Interpen group in unflattering"},{"pageNumber":707,"pageContent":"terms: ...HEMMING received considerable newspaper publicity which caused adventurers from all over the United States to come and join his organization. Most of these adventurers and mercenaries later became police problems and a number of them have been arrested for vagrancy, larceny, bad checks, and other minor offenses. Members of HEMMING’s group usually stay in flophouses, eat at the Salvation Army and other relief organizations, beg money and food from Cuban refugees, and at times, form military training camps. Membership in INTERPEN seldom consists of over twenty individuals. However, the turnover is high, because the members soon become dissatisfied with the organization’s inactivity and leadership. During the past two years, HEMMING has visited the majority of the Cuban refugee leaders in Miami and has offered his group’s services, and requested money contributions. However, Cuban refugee leaders are reluctant to participate in any action with HEMMING. At times, HEMMING has attempted to launch military invasions of Cuba, and on December 4, 1962, he and twelve others, who were attempting to launch a military invasion of Cuba from Marathon, Florida, were arrested by United States Customs Agents. [Deleted} advised that although HEMMING claims to be anti-Communist, he is amoral, being for or against Communism depending on how it personally affects him; he is capable of anything, and is motivated by a dream of future economic and political advantage and power in Latin America.... (Emphasis added) Hemming later told me that by this time, J. Edgar Hoover had targeted him because of Hemmings’ involvement in obtaining the compromising photographs of Hoover. [565] Howard K. Davis was Hemming’s most trusted associate, perhaps his equal or senior partner. Hemming described Davis in comradely, affectionate terms, calling him “Davey.” Davis, a decorated ex- Army Airborne Ranger, was a pilot flying arms to Raul Castro during the Cuban revolution and later became a pilot for an airline on the East Coast of the U.S. Davis was 33 years old at the time of the Kennedy assassination. Gary Shaw, who met Davis, describes him as quite different from Hemming in that Davis is very quiet. According to Fonzi’s notes in an HSCA document that Hemming gave me, Howard Davis was Interpen’s contact man with the Mafia. Davis also was coordinator with New York financier Theodore Racoosin in the Pawley-Bayo affair. Racoosin was well connected to the White House.

According to an article in the New York Times, November 3, 1996, she was then forty-two years old, and married to Ronald O. Perelman, the Revlon billionaire; she is a strikingly beautiful woman and an active socialite in New York, Palm Beach, and Washington, D.C., and is close to President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton at the White House. [570] Hemming expressed strong feelings to me that Larry LaBorde was involved in the JFK"},{"pageNumber":708,"pageContent":"assassination. When Hemming had come upon the information about Jack Lawrence a few years before, he put two and two together and assumed that the Jack Lawrence in Dallas was the same person as the Jack Lawrence in New Orleans. This had significance in that it would have been a direct link to Hemming and LaBorde in New Orleans. This led Hemming to believe that it was part of an attempt to frame him in the Kennedy assassination. To check into this, I contacted Sheldon Inkol in Toronto, Canada, who had done considerable research on the Jack Lawrence in Dallas. Inkol believes that the Jack Lawrence in New Orleans is a different person from the one in Dallas. He bases his conclusion largely on a physical description of the New Orleans Jack Lawrence that Hemming telephoned to him in 1994, compared to the known description of the Dallas Jack Lawrence, and records showing them as having different birthplaces and birth dates. Inkol also came to believe that the Dallas Jack Lawrence had nothing (wittingly) to do with the Kennedy assassination. Inkol agrees with me that there are many disturbing questions concerning the events and people at the Downtown Lincoln-Mercury Agency in Dallas. After spending several weeks off and on researching this subject, I reluctantly decided to shelve it, at least temporarily, as another curious and very suspicious set of coincidences that should be given in-depth study. [571] Sheldon Inkol, Third Decade, Vol. 7, #5, July 1991, p.3 [572] In our first meeting in Fort Lauderdale, Hemming handed me a four-page document that he had prepared for me which explains his trip to Washington D.C. in February/March 1963. It was in part to launch an all-out effort to rescue eight of his men who had been illegally captured by Cuban security forces off of “Elbow Cay,” which was “within the sovereign territory of the British Bahama Island.” While in Washington D.C., Hemming met with General Ted Clifton at the White House, Sterling Cottrell at the State Department, and General Victor J. Krulak, U.S.M.C. and special assistant to the Secretary of Defense. Hemming wrote: “I informed Angleton (via secure line) of my plan to raise both national and international outrage to save the kidnapped commandos and he agreed, but insisted on a certain pattern so that the ’dye in the water’ could be traced back by his CI people! Therefore, duplicate & triplicate calls were made from other phones on a limited basis so that Angleton’s crew could analyze the tabs and traces to see where U.S. Gov’t officers might [have] acquired their intelligence via the Cubans without reporting them as assets, or worse, mole conduits!” Hemming’s “call list” on “moderate secure phones” included Theodore Racoosin, N.Y.C.; Lester Logue, Dallas, TX; D. G. Lewis, L.A.; Major General Edwin Walker, Dallas, TX. Hemming described the foregoing as “primary cover” for another purpose which was “JFK trip to Costa Rica briefing & Mexico Transit to Cuba problems ” (My emphasis). Don’t tell me that Hemming wasn’t a U.S. intelligence agent!

In a telephone conversation with Hemming in July 1997, he told me that he did not know where Hargraves was during the week of November 22, 1963, but Hargraves was repairing a boat with him at Christmas, 1963. [575] FBI No. 62-109060-4450 dated February 6, 1967 [576] NARA 124-10175-10295; FBI document no. 62-109060-7189 [577] Fonzi wrote “...Al Gonzales [HSCA staffer] and I had been deliberately stopped short in"},{"pageNumber":709,"pageContent":"developing a vital piece of information...an investigative coup...that was crushed by forces involved that went to the heart of Bob Blakey’s and the HSCA arrangement with the CIA.” Fonzi’s source began with a Miami jail inmate, Rolando Otero, who led them to another source, a Florida State prison inmate code- named Ten-One (by Fonzi), who had told Otero that Oswald was sent to Russia as a CIA agent and the decision had been made to kill Kennedy before Oswald returned from Russia. Ten-One said that Carlos was in contact with Oswald and was posing as a photographer at Dealey Plaza on November 22nd. Important here is that Ten-One had a close linkage with Mitchell WerBell, the arms dealer whom Hemming and Carlos jointly represented. It was through WerBell, Fonzi wrote, that Ten-One met Carlos. An interesting linkage is that Otero said he understood from Carlos that most of the final planning and coordination took place in the Dallas YMCA building. (Fonzi, pp. 232237) This is where Oswald stayed for one night, and Jack Lawrence, Lawrence Howard, and Loran Hall were staying at various times in late 1963. (Memo, William C. Boxley, Jim Garrison, September 15, 1967, quoting Mike Acoca of Life magazine as to Hall and Howard.) Howard denied he stayed there, saying Loran Hall must have used his name.

May 26, 1997 [580] Peter Dale Scott, Deep Politics, p. 105 [581] I have deleted parts of the profanity. My feeling is that in extended conversations profanity distorts meaning more than it conveys meaning. Also, Hemming had expressed to me his disappointment that A. J. Weberman had included all of the profanity in his web site on the Internet. Moreover, explicit recording, in writing, of profanity conveys a much harsher impression of a person than is justified. After all, many of our presidents, including JFK, used extreme profanity in private conversations. Use of profanity does not necessarily mean that the person is a liar or unreliable. However, in cases in which I thought the profanity was necessary to convey Hemming’s feelings and attitudes, it has not been deleted. [582] Hemming later confirmed that this was the reported incident concerning Bill Harvey/Johnny Rosselli in which these two were personally handling the transfer of weapons. [583] According to State Department documents, de Mohrenschildt and his wife were living in Haiti at the time of the assassination. They arrived there on June 2, 1963. He told State Department officials that he left Dallas on April 19, 1963, traveled to New York and Philadelphia, and then returned to Dallas for “two days” to make preparations for the final trip to Haiti. But he did not leave Dallas until late May 1963. He was ostensibly in Haiti on a geological survey for oil, but, according to one witness, could have been on a CIA or MI undercover mission, contemplating the overthrow of Duvalier’s regime. De Mohrenschildt was dealing with Haiti’s Duvalier in the sale of boats, weapons, and two T-28 fighter planes from Dallas that were reportedly flown to Haiti illegally. He also was reported to have had $200,000 or $250,000 deposited in his bank account in Port-au-Prince shortly after the JFK assassination. (HSCA Vol. XII, pp. 54-62.) It is entirely possible that he could have been flown to Dallas and been at the Texas Club on July 5, 1963. De Mohrenschildt has demonstrated himself to be an obfuscator in many aspects of his statements about his role with Oswald and the JFK assassination. Whom shall we believe? Him or Hemming? De Mohrenschildt was a friend of Lyndon Johnson and corresponded with him after the JFK assassination. (Russell, pp. 271, 272, citing LBJ Library.) "},{"pageNumber":710,"pageContent":"[584] Hemming later clarified this, saying that the Texans were initially offering financial support for a raid which could rally American citizens to support “freedom fighters in Cuba” and a “hit on Fidel,” which Hemming opposed because he preferred infiltration runs. [585] Hemming clarified this later: He wrote, “I was extremely leery of ’agents-provocateurs’ inside right-wing groups who would attempt to set us up to commit federal/state felonies.” This made some sense to me in that it was a practice of the FBI at that time to infiltrate radical organizations with the intent of making them even more radical by provoking their tendency for violence. An example of this is the FBI’s penetration of the Ku Klux Klan, supposedly to break it up, but in reality to spur it toward even more violence. (Halpern, Berman, Borosage, Marwich, The Lawless State, pp. 125-126.) It is not beyond reason to me to imagine that a government agency in that era, such as the FBI, would conceive of an agent provocateur to infiltrate the John Birch Society, for example, and incite some of their more impassioned members to promote a plot to kill JFK, and to set up Hemming’s group as a fallback false flag. However, I’m not proposing that that is what happened. It is equally plausible to me that this is Hemming’s cover story. [586] Hemming explained this in a note: “Threats to the family—if he doesn’t go— they all go! ” [587] Based on this exchange, I later surmised that Pawley was killed because he knew too much and might, to relieve his conscience, talk. He was in his eighties at the time he died. [588] Hemming had told me in San Diego that his hair had become bleached by constant exposure to the sun in his paramilitary training exercises. [589] Hal Hendrix was the newsman who strangely knew all about Oswald—knew he had defected to Russia, returned to the U.S., etc.—early in the afternoon of November 22, 1963, when newsman Seth Kantor talked with him from Dallas. Was Hemming Hendrix’ source? Hemming said no. Hendrix also knew about the coup that ousted the pro-Kennedy Bosch, of the Dominican Republic, twenty-four hours before it happened. (Summers, Conspiracy pp. 104-105; also Kantor, The Ruby Cover-Up and CD 1133.) [590] Hemming noted the following in his review of this chapter: “I was bunking at the operations dormitory, control tower, M.C.A.S. El Toro at this time—back in uniform (illegally)—passed through the main gate at El Toro saying I was picking up pizzas, then picked up by USMC sergeant in U.S.N. gray Chevy pickup truck and driven to Rider pickup area outside M.C.A.A.F. (LTA) Santa Ana (Tustin) and covered up my ’out-of-uniform’ utilities (fatigues) with a raincoat and removed ’cover ’ (hat). Oswald wasn’t fooled though! ’You back at El Toro again!?’ ” [591] Hemming noted: “I had to distract LHO from believing that I had any intent of returning to Cuba, except if ordered to Gitmo for duty, which is not ’going to Cuba’ as Gitmo ’backed down’! LHO also blundered in asking how much I ’shipped over for ’—4 or 6 years? (reinlisted in U.S.M.C.) which indicated he not only knew I was ex-USMC (at consulate) but based at El Toro previously and to be back in utilities I must have reenlisted. I avoided any talk of the Marine Corps at all!” [592] John Newman, Oswald and the CIA, pp. 421, 422 [593] These scenarios are, of course, an effort to discretely break down the range of possibilities. In reality, they would overlap and there would be more nuances; and there would be one scenario that"},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"describes exactly what happened, which we may never know with certainty.

Note: See Appendix B for a list of 95 documents about Hemming in the National Archives. At the time of the cut-off point in publishing the first edition of Bloody Treason, many of these were “referred to other agencies,” pending release to the public. [603] Alexander Rorke had CIA and FBI connections. He was the son-in-law of Sherman Billingsley, owner of the Stork Club in New York and friend of J. Edgar Hoover, who frequented the club along with Mafia chief Frank Costello (Costello was rumored to have been the actual owner of the club). After the Rorke flight left Mirada, it landed in Cozumel, Mexico, then disappeared and has never been seen or heard from since. [604] The suspicion that the Secret Service was bribed is not a figment of my imagination; the thought also occurred to Robert Kennedy. William Turner, former FBI agent under J. Edgar Hoover, wrote, “Bobby Kennedy instinctively believed that there was more to his brother’s assassination than Lee Harvey Oswald. But he was not in a position to turn the Justice Department loose to try to discover who was responsible. He was now a lame-duck attorney general, hated both by Hoover and Johnson. Bobby did the next-best thing: He instructed Daniel P. Moynihan, then Assistant Secretary of Labor and a charter member of the Kennedy inner circle, to secretly investigate the possibility that Bobby’s arch-enemy Jimmy Hoffa was behind the plot. (Kennedy thought that Hoffa might have bribed the Secret Service.) Moynihan assembled a small team of trusted Justice Department agents to discreetly carry out the inquiry, but in the end he was forced to report that no evidence of Hoffa’s complicity could be found. However, his inquiry did conclude that Secret Service protection of John Kennedy in Dallas had been derelict, if not corrupt.” (Hinckle and Turner, Deadly Secrets: The CIA-Mafia War Against Castro and the Assassination of JFK, p. 259.

It was firm, he kept insisting; it was his state, and if the President didn’t like it, he could stay home. That really made me feel good. “I just want to tell you one thing, Governor,” I said. “He’s the President. I’m here to get everybody’s recommendations, and I’ll forward them to the White House. But they’ll decide.” With that, Connally jumped up from the table, grabbed a phone, and said, “Get me the White House.” Then we all waited. “Get me Kenny O’Donnell.” Then he started talking about the entire schedule: here’s what’s going to happen in Houston, here’s what we’ll do in San Antonio. Then we wait. “Fine, fine, I’ll get back to you,” Connally said. And he came back to the table and started in, saying, “This is what we want him to do.” Bruno & Greenfield, The Advance Man, pp. 88-89 (Emphasis added) [610] Jerry Bruno and Jeff Greenfield, The Advance Man p. 90 [611] Jerry Bruno and Jeff Greenfield, The Advance Man p. 92; also see HSCA Report, pp. 182-183 [612] David Howard Bird was a member of the board of directors of Jack Crichton’s firm, Dorchester Gas Producing (Richard Bartholomew, “Possible Discovery of an Automobile Used in the JFK Conspiracy,” Proceedings of the Second Research Conference of the Third Decade, June 18-20, 1993). Crichton, reserve Army intelligence, was one of the first persons to interview Marina Oswald and had met with H. L. Hunt shortly after the assassination (see Chapter 23) [613] Darwin Payne, Dallas: An Illustrated History. The Dallas Citizens’ Council, described as an oligarchy, was founded in 1937. Its membership was uniquely limited to heads of companies in Dallas. Doctors, lawyers, and professional people were not eligible for membership. It sponsored JFK’s trip to Dallas. [614] William F. Pepper, Orders to Kill: The Truth Behind the Murder of Martin Luther King, pp. 351-352 [615] It was not planned that Connally would ride with JFK. On the morning of November 22, Kennedy angrily ordered aide Lawrence O’Brien: “I don’t care if you have to throw Yarborough into the car with Lyndon. But get him in there.” (Reston, Jr., Lone Star, p. 270) But even if Connally had been in the same car with LBJ, the same ploy could apply. In an interview with Johnson on April 15, 1975, he remarked to journalist Marianne Means, “Some people even think I directed it [the assassination]....it’s a lucky thing I was there in the motorcade and could have gotten it too.” ( Marianne Means Washington, April 18, 1975) [616] James Reston, Jr., The Lone Star, p. 257 [617] HSCA Report, p. 233 [618] Bolden was the first black member of the Secret Service White House Detail.

V. Harkness which reinforces Jean Hill), or without discussing innocent explanations for flaws in the testimony. After I had written this account of Jean Hill and decided to include her story despite its ambiguities, a very satisfying moment occurred at a November 1993 symposium in Dallas. Researcher Wallace Milam made a presentation which drew a standing ovation from the audience. He had discovered that in fact there was a dog! Hill’s statement about a dog turned out to be indisputably true. Milam presented a photograph and a film of a small, stuffed toy dog in Jacqueline Kennedy’s arms that had been handed to her by a little girl along the parade route. This, after Jean Hill had been pilloried and discredited for thirty years by anti-conspiracy zealots like Gerald Posner. One of the “flaws” that Posner had jumped on in his book was her statement about the dog. With this discovery by Milam, Hill was vindicated and her testimony made much more credible. [630] For a remarkable investigation of the Secret Service’s role in the JFK assassination, read The Third Alternative, a self-published book by Vincent Palamara, a native of Pittsburgh, PA. At the time he wrote his manuscript in 1992, Palamara was twenty-seven years old with a degree in sociology/psychology from Duquesne University. Astonishingly, he had been totally immersed in the Kennedy assassination since he was twelve years old. Palamara succeeded in getting numerous interviews with key retired agents who were with the Secret Service at the time of the assassination. His work on his book encompassed a five-year period. Also, one interview by Palamara was with advance man Marty Underwood, who worked on the planning of JFK’s Texas tour (only his stops at Houston and Austin). Following are excerpts from that interview that stand out to me: In an exclusive interview conducted on 10/9/92, the author [Palamara] obtained the following new"},{"pageNumber":714,"pageContent":"information: Underwood became “an honorary Secret Service agent” and served under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. While with LBJ, he became the “aide in charge of the Secret Service.” The advance man confirmed to this author [Palamara] that JFK did not restrict agents from riding in the Presidential limousine... ...Underwood stated that the CIA, the FBI, and the mafia “knew (JFK) was going to be hit” on 11/22/63—this information came from his direct contacts with CIA officer Win Scott, the Mexico City Station Chief during Oswald’s visit to that region! In addition, Underwood stated that, eighteen hours before Kennedy’s murder, “we were getting all sorts of rumors that the President was going to be assassinated in Dallas; there were no if’s, and’s, or but’s about it.” When Underwood told JFK about these disturbing reports, the President merely said, “Marty, you worry about me too much” (indeed, JFK told San Antonio Congressman Henry Gonzalez on 11/21/63: “The Secret Service told me that they have taken care of everything. There’s nothing to worry about”). The reason why Underwood opened up to me [Palamara] is best expressed by him: “Everyone who had anything to do with Dallas in any way—Kenny O’Donnell, the Secret Service —they’re practically all dead now. I just think people should know the truth.” However, as of this date [1992], only a few of the agents have passed on (including Greer and Kellerman).

In 1963 the persecution of gays in the United States had probably reached its zenith. Even today it would probably be impossible for the head of the FBI to be revealed as gay and retain his or her position.

John Mitchell, who had left the post of Attorney General in order to run Nixon’s re- election campaign, had the same worry. His orders that morning, Haldeman noted at the time, were to hunt down “the skeletons.” It was decided not to announce Edgar’s death publicly until eleven o’clock. Gordon Liddy, Nixon’s dirty-tricks specialist, thought it was vital to find the skeletons. As an FBI veteran, he had once worked with some of Edgar’s most sensitive political files. “I called the White"},{"pageNumber":716,"pageContent":"House at once,” Liddy recalled. “I said, ‘You’ve got to get those files. They are a source of enormous power. You don’t have much time. There’s going to be a race on. Get those files.’ ” A group of fifteen to eighteen agents was sent to ransack Hoover’s house, where it was suspected that the most explosive files were kept, but someone may have gotten there before them, perhaps some of Hoover’s top aides or even the CIA. Two neighbors recalled in 1992 that, some time that morning, they had seen two men carrying a large object wrapped in a quilt out the kitchen door. They put it in a station wagon and drove away.

Apparently it was not resisted by the Kennedy party; in fact, the family reportedly was adamant that the body not remain in Texas. But many researchers believe that Johnson was behind this decision, taking into account the necessity that the conspirators be in control of the autopsy, because their initial plan had gone awry (Oswald had been captured) and the plan was now shifted from a Communist conspiracy to a lone gunman. And it would have been very difficult—even with a crooked coroner in Texas—for the incredibly complex, illegal, and unprecedented manipulations in the autopsy (to conceal the evidence of a second gunman) to have been done at Dallas Parkland Hospital, so close to the team of doctors and nurses who saw an entry wound in the throat and an exit wound in the back of the head. Much better for Johnson that the autopsy be under military control, performed by military doctors dutifully taking orders.

In fact, they were carefully planned...the product of meticulous calculation.... Robert Dallek, Lone Star Rising , pp. 474-475 [709] Johnson’s preemptive announcement was made two days before Congress was to take up action to follow up on a proposal by Congressman Charles Goodell to form a joint Congressional Committee to conduct an investigation of the assassination. Had the Congress gone ahead with determination, the conspiracy would probably have been uncovered, history may have been radically changed, and possibly millions of lives spared that were lost in the Vietnam war and its aftermath. [710] Hoover released the results of his report to the press before he sent it to the Warren Commission—a fait accompli—much to the dismay of the Warren Commission staff in that they were put in the position of having to go up against J. Edgar Hoover in public—a personally very dangerous thing.

But Johnson is still using the Mexico City fabrications to achieve his purpose. [717] Presumably Robert Kennedy. [718] Senator Russell later had grave misgivings about the conduct of the Warren Commission and considered resigning from it. In the end, however, he went along reluctantly with the final report.

[720] Caro, Means of Ascent: The Years of Lyndon Johnson, p. xxvi [721] Robert Dallek wrote: A November 1988 Louis Harris poll on presidential performance from Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan consistently ranked Johnson near or at the bottom of eleven categories. Asked which of these Presidents made people feel proudest of being an American, most inspired confidence in the White House, and could be trusted most in a crisis, respondents consistently put LBJ last along side of Gerald Ford and behind Richard Nixon. Who will history view as the best among"},{"pageNumber":720,"pageContent":"these Presidents? Only 1 percent chose Johnson. The President best able to get things done? Three percent said Johnson, 1 percent more than said Jimmy Carter and 2 percent more than said Ford. And the President setting the highest moral standards? JFK, Reagan, and Carter, in that order, led the list. Johnson stood alone in last place, chosen by only 1 percent of the sample. Even Richard Nixon fared better with 2 percent of the vote. [Emphasis added] One biographer and historian [Stephen B. Oates] has puzzled over the popular appeal of this negative portrait of LBJ. “Maybe Johnson has become so hated in our time that Americans want him reduced to caricature, want him presented as...[someone] who deceived us with his promise of the Great Society, who took away our idealism and our humanity in the flames of Vietnam. Maybe Johnson has become a scapegoat for our collective guilt over the war, and all our woes and shattered dreams that followed.” [Italics in original] Robert Dallek, Lone Star Rising, pp. 3-4; also citing Harris Poll 1988, #97, Nov. 20, 1988; material in quotes from Stephen B.

This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to learn more about the JFK assassination. But it does have its share of serious faults and pitfalls, and the outline of the conspiracy he describes is much too simple. However, if its key aspects prove to be accurate, it is very important. McClellan wrote of Lyndon Johnson’s near death confession to his lawyer Don Thomas in which LBJ said, in effect, that “I had to do it; I had no choice; that damned Bobbie [Robert Kennedy] was closing in on me, stirring everything, surrounding me. I was about to be killed and had to shoot back.” In other words, survival instinct made LBJ do it. McClellan readily states, understandably, that he doesn’t have"},{"pageNumber":721,"pageContent":"tapes or documents to back this up. And, I would add, such probably never existed—after all, high level criminals and traitors are not known for leaving paper or magnetic trails. McClellan also wrote that LBJ’s hit-man, Mac Wallace, along with Oswald, were the gunmen on the sixth floor, and a third gunman recruited by Wallace was shooting from the grassy knoll area. He presents evidence of Mac Wallace’s fingerprints on cardboard boxes on the sixth floor, and includes evidence that Wallace was a convicted murderer; and did other murders ordered by LBJ in Texas. This has been reported and written about extensively by others and is, by and large, convincing. The fingerprint evidence is backed up by a private fingerprint analyst and a key fingerprint expert at Interpol in Europe. McClellan was a partner in the Austin, Texas law firm that handled LBJ’s legal work and other matters over his entire political career. The name of the firm in 1960 was Clark, Mathews, Thomas, Harris & Denius . The head of the firm was LBJ’s long time friend Edward Aubrey Clark, who according to McClellan, was the man who took care of LBJ’s crimes including assassination of President Kennedy. Don Thomas was another close friend of LBJ and was a partner in the firm. McClellan joined the firm in 1966 and was there for about ten years before leaving. He became a full partner in 1972. He writes that it was common talk among the lawyers in the firm that LBJ was behind the killing of JFK. He put together the story about the near death confession from specific discussions with Don Thomas and other lawyers in the firm, including associate attorney John Coates. This material, in its full context, deserves careful reading in McClellan’s book, keeping in mind that it’s most important parts are hearsay, or even double hearsay, from a “death bed” confession but admissible in a court of law, in some cases, when it is part of other strong circumstantial evidence. [See Chapter 9, Questions of Evidence.] I am inclined to believe it because it fits into all the other evidence, and my sense is that Barr McClellan is being very honest about this terrible subject, particularly regarding his private conversations with the other lawyers in the firm. A fault I do find in McClellan’s book is that he leaves out important evidence that could explain the larger plot. He writes essentially nothing about the New Orleans evidence (Bannister, Ferrie, Oswald, Clay Shaw, the CIA) the military, the mafia, the French connection, William Harvey and ZR/Rifle, David Morales, anti-Castro Cubans, Angleton, and Oswald in Mexico City. I can see how a combination of these elements could have been joined into the conspiracy after the word was out that LBJ would be behind it. It concerns me that McClellan, in confining the plot to LBJ and Texas big oil, tends to let other main culprits off the hook and, paradoxically, LBJ becomes a sort of scapegoat, albeit an evil and deserving one. As the years go by and more is developed about this huge rupture in American history that occurred on that fateful day it becomes clear that it went beyond the assassination of John F. Kennedy. I’m speaking here of the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and what it tells us about the psyche of our nation, or will tell us, if the complete, ugly truth forces its way out of our minds in denial. There are more possibilities to be addressed, such as, was it really Clark and LBJ who started the plot, or was Clark acting on behalf of a plot by others, sponsored by J. Edgar Hoover, H. L. Hunt, and Clint Murchison, who, in turn, joined with the mob and Bill Harvey, to get LBJ’s approval before it all went ahead to the tragic end? [733] The letter by Evelyn Lincoln was provided to me by author John Davis. To determine its authenticity, an attempt was made by Bob Clark of KPSI Radio in Palm Springs, California, to contact Richard Duncan at the Northside Middle School, but he had left there. The school gave Clark a telephone number to reach him, but it had been disconnected. However, the authenticity was buttressed by author Anthony Summers, who wrote to Bob Dorff: “Thanks for the Evelyn Lincoln. It did not surprise, since La Lincoln told me this and more, back in the eighties....”"},{"pageNumber":722,"pageContent":" [734] These conclusions, my opinions, are greatly simplified; for details of proof, the text must be studied with diligence.
