This great image, whose splendor was excellent, stood before you; and its form was awesome. This imageís head was of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and his thighs of bronze, its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. You watched while a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces. Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed together, and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.î ñ Daniel 2: 31-35 I. Introduction According to the official version of history, during the Second World War the German National Socialists carried out a mass murder against the Jewish population that was unparalleled in its monstrousness and its sys- tematic ruthlessness. Many millions of Jews, we are told, were taken from German-ruled lands and packed off to ëextermination campsí in the Polish territories and there killed, mostly in gas chambers but some in gas vans. We are also told the Germans massacred an immense number of Jews behind the eastern front. The total number of victims of gassing or shooting as well as of those who died from disease, exhaustion, hunger or other cause supposedly runs to five or six million. This claimed unique genocide is usually labeled with the word ëHolo- caustí, which comes from the Greek word Û λ o καυστ Û s for ì entirely burned î, and which has spread throughout and beyond the Anglo-Saxon language domain since the release of the US motion picture of the same name in 1979. The version of the fate of the Jews during the Second World War just summarized can be found in all the dictionaries and history books of the Western world. It is taken as axiomatic in any public discussion on the ëHolocaustí. Deviation from this version is discouraged. Dissenting voices are stilled by a powerful media censorship and in many European states they are suppressed with police-state terror tactics."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY In the last few decades a vast literature on the ëHolocaustí has appeared, but there is general agreement that there is one work which can be regarded as the standard work on the subject: Raul Hilbergís The Destruc- tion of the European Jews . Born in Vienna in 1926, the Jew Hilberg emigrated to the United States with his parents in 1939. In 1944 he joined the American Army. In 1948 he began to study the question of the destiny of the Jews under the National Socialist regime. In the years 1951/52 he worked in the Federal Documentation Center at Alexandria, Virginia, where his job was to evalu- ate captured German documents. In 1952 he was awarded a Masterís degree in Political Science, and in 1955 the Doctorís degree in Law. As is the case with most other authors who have dealt with the ëHolocaustí, he is not a his- torian by profession. However, for many years at the University of Vermont, in addition to International Relations and US Foreign Policy he has taught on the history of the Jews during the Second World War. 1 The Destruction of the European Jews first appeared in 1961 and was reprinted unchanged in 1967 and 1979. In 1985, a ì revised and definitive î edition with a few changes followed. Amazingly, the complete work was not published in German until 1982, and then only by a small publisher (Olle and Wolter in Berlin). It was called Die Vernichtung der europ‰ischen Juden . We will use the three-volume edition published May 1997 by Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag in Frankfurt, based on the ì definitive î English version of 1985. 2 Hilbergís study on the ëHolocaustí claims to be the unrivalled best and most exhaustive work of its kind. This is made unmistakably clear in the introduction to the German edition of the work: ìIf the phrase ëstandard workí has any meaning at all, Hilbergís famous comprehensive history of the Holocaust must be considered as such. [...] The theme of this work is the malefactors, the plan, the method of oper- ation and the operation itself. With the ëcoolness and precisioní which char- acterizes the great historians (S ̧ddeutsche Zeitung) Hilberg traces the involvement and participation of the ruling elites in the government, in industry and the armed forces in the destruction of the Jews. The functional dedication of the ordinary bureaucrat, railway man, policeman and soldier to the work of annihilation will also be traced. A type of criminal steps for- ward (who will be named) who will never stand before a judge after 1945: 1 For Hilbergís biography see the Introduction to the German edition of Hilbergís work, ( Die Vernichtung der europ‰ischen Juden , Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, Frankfurt 1997), and also Barbara Kulaszka (ed.)

They have recorded the proof of their deadly handiworkówith characteristic thoroughnessóa hun- dred thousand times overówith official stationery and seals. The present comprehensive history of the Holocaust is ësource mate- rial for specialists, analysis for theoreticians and a history book without parallel for the general public.í (Sunday Times).î That Hilbergís work is the result of an immense and devoted labor is recognized even by Revisionists, those who dispute the current version of the fate of the Jews in the Third Reich. For the Frenchman Prof. Robert Faurisson, one of the most prominent Revisionists, Hilberg stands ì high above Poliakov, Wellers, Klarsfeld and others like them .î 3 Because of Hil- bergís dominant position in orthodox ëHolocaustí literature the Revisionists have had to confront his work again and again. The first such confrontation was in 1964, three years after the appearance of the first edition of The Destruction of the European Jews . At that time, the Frenchman Paul Rassinier, a former Resistance fighter, ex-prisoner of the NS concentration camps Buchenwald and Dora, and the founder of Revisionism, made a full attack on Hilberg. In his book Le Drame des Juifs EuropÈens , Rassinier made a thorough study of Hilbergís statistics on Jewish population losses during the Second World War. He rejected the latterís conclusion that the number of Jewish victims should be set at 5.1 million; he said Hilberg could only have arrived at this number by a gross manipulation of his data. According to Rassinier, and based on Hilbergís data, the real number of Jewish NS victims was less than one million. 4 Revisionist research has not stood still in the more than 35 years since the appearance of Rassinierís critique of Hilberg. However, there has never been a comprehensive analysis of the methods Hilberg applied nor a critical appraisal of his conclusions. The purpose of the present work is to remedy that lack. Our investigation will concentrate on the following points: 3 Robert Faurisson, ì Mon expÈrience du rÈvisionnisme î, in: Annales d'Histoire RÈvisionniste , Nr. 8, Spring 1990; quoted from Robert Faurisson, ...crits rÈvisionnistes (1974-1998) , 4 volumes, privately published 1999, p. 954 (v.

General Remarks Three points are noteworthy on a first reading of Hilbergís work: 1. Consistent Ignoring of Opposing Theses Whoever undertook to read Hilbergís standard work without further knowledge of the problems in the study of the ëHolocaustí would never sus- pect that the version of events offered there is in dispute. Hilberg does not utter the least suggestion that there is a school of researchers who dispute not only the existence of a policy of extermination of the Jews in the Third Reich but also the existence of ë extermination campsí and homicidal gas chambers. Other advocates of the orthodox version of the ëHolocaustí at least mention the existence of such deviant ideas, usually only to malign them without studying them. 5 Hilberg, however, pretends he has never heard anything of the Revisionists. He pretends he has never heard of the studies of such respected and serious scholars as Arthur Butz, Wilhelm St‰glich or Robert Faurisson. Hilberg does not make mention of a single Revisionist book or a single Revisionist journal, and he does not even peripherally discuss any Revisionist objection to the annihilation thesis. When Hilberg published the first edition of The Destruction of the European Jews in 1961, he could perhaps have justified ignoring view- points which threw doubt on the accepted version of the fate of Jews in the Third Reich; the few Revisionist works of the time were fairly modest. 6 In 1985 such a position was no longer tenable. (It is worth noting that Revi- sionist research has made great progress since that year while the propo- 5 In the introduction to the collection Nationalsozialistische Massentˆtungen durch Giftgas (Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, Frankfurt 1986), edited by Eugen Kogon, Hermann Langbein, Adalbert R ̧ckerl and others, the editors thunder against the ìapologists for Nazi theory and practiceî who ìdenyî the events of the past, from which in any case the reader can see that there are some who dispute the accepted version of the ëHolocaustí. Of course, neither authors nor titles are named. 6 One example is Paul Rassinierís remarkable book Le Mensonge díUlysse , which had appeared as early as 1950 (reprinted by La Vieille Taupe, Paris 1980; online: http://aaargh.vho.org/fran/ archRassi/prmu/prmu.html). However, this is a report of personal experienceónecessarily colored by subjective impressionsóand not a work of scholarly rigor."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY nents of the extermination thesis have been marching in place and, with the sole exception of Jean-Claude Pressac, have nothing new to offer.) Because ignoring or suppressing counter-arguments is a telltale sign of unscholarly method, considerable doubt must be cast on the credibility of Hilbergís scholarship. 2. No Photos, No Description of the Homicidal Gas Chambers and Gas Vans Hilbergís gigantic three-volume work, running to 1,351 pages, con- tains exactly three photographs, namely those on the title pages of the three volumes. ( Destruction of the European Jews , hereafter called DEJ , runs to 1,232 pages; there are no photographs.) In the text itself there is not one photograph, which must be considered unusual for so extensive a work. Likewise, he offers his reader no description of a gas chamber or a gas van, although this would seem to be important in view of the novelty and the monstrousness of the use of such killing machines. There is no illustration or sketch which might give inquisitive readeres insight into how these grue- some instruments of murder allegedly functioned. Hilbergís aversion to encounter the physical reality of the concentra- tion camps and the so-called ëextermination campsí can also be seen in the fact that he has never personally undertaken an investigation at the locations of the camps. Before 1985, this man who had begun his studies on the ëHolocaustí back in 1948 had spent exactly one day in Treblinka and another half day in Auschwitz I and Auschwitz-Birkenauó and in all three cases this was only to participate in memorial ceremonies . He has never visited any of the other concentration camps at any time. 7 This has a very odd appearance. In contrast to Hilberg, Revisionists such as Dietlieb Fel- derer, Robert Faurisson, Carlo Mattogno, Germar Rudolf and the writer of these lines, and also the non-Revisionist Jean-Claude Pressac, have made thorough examinations of the buildings where the witnesses say the mass murders took place and have studied the applicable construction drawings. Such on-site research is absolutely necessary for solving this controversy. 3. Discrepancy Between the Title and the Contents of the Work There is no doubt that the larger part of the material Hilberg presents rests on reliable sources. This applies particularly to the four hundred pages 7 Hilbergís statement under cross-examination by defense attorney Douglas Christie in the first Z ̧ndel trial in Toronto in 1985, cited in Barbara Kulaszka, op. cit.

G ENERAL R EMARKS in which he describes the persecution of the Jews ( Judenverfolgung ), the anti-Jewish laws and measures taken by Germany and her allies. However, the work is not entitled The Persecution of the European Jews ( Die Verfol- gung der europ‰ischen Juden ), but The Destruction of the European Jews ( Die Vernichtung der europ‰ischen Juden ), and his title is not suitable for the work taken as a whole. Someone who has struggled through the 283 pages of the first volume has not yet encountered the subject for which Hil- berg has named his work. The first 123 pages of the second volume, namely pages 287 to 410 ( DEJ , v. 1, pages 271-390), are devoted to the ì Mobile Killing Operations î; this concerns the mass killings behind the eastern front. No fewer than 515 pages (pp. 411 to 926; DEJ , v. 2, pages 391-860) deal with the deportations of Jews from areas controlled by Germany or her allies. With respect to the deportations, the facts are largely undisputed. That which makes the ëHolocaustí so spectacular and bestial in the popular imagination, namely the industrialized slaughter in extermination camps, first shows its face on page 927; this is the beginning of the chapter on ì Killing Center Operations î ( DEJ , v. 3, pages 861-990). Yet the reader must persevere for another hundred pages until the subject finally comes around to the ì Killing Operations î; in the previous five subchapters ì Ori- gins î, ì Organisation, Personnel and Maintenance î, ì Labor Utilization î, ì Medical Experiments î and finally ì Confiscations î in the ì Annihilation Centers î were discussed. Remarkably, the subchapter ì Killing Operations î is only nineteen (!!!) pages long ( DEJ : 18); on page 1046 ( DEJ , p. 979), the subject has already moved on to ì Liquidation of the Killing Centers and the End of the Destruction Process î. The third volume of 290 pages is devoted entirely to ì Conse- quences î, ì Reflections î, ì Aftereffects î and ì Further Developments î before the Appendix closes the work; the latter contains Hilbergís data on Jewish population losses.

In the third volume, only the population statistics are appli- cable to our subject. Already at this point it can be seen that the Hilberg work does not contain what the title promises. Of course, this makes the work of the critic easier in that it permits him to concentrate on a relatively small part of this large work and dispense with the rest with a few comments."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15 III. Remarks on the First Volume Hilberg introduces the first chapter of his work (ì Precedents î) with the following words: 8 ìThe German destruction of the European Jews was a tour de force; the Jewish collapse under the German assault was a manifestation of fail- ure. Both of these phenomena were the final product of an earlier age. Anti-Jewish politicies and actions did not have their beginning in 1933. For many centuries, and in many countries, the Jews had been victims of destructive action.î (p. 11; DEJ , p. 5) There are additional remarks on ëanti-Semitismí in European history. Hilberg regards the ì Nazi destruction process î as the ì culmination of a cyclical trend .î In the beginning, there were attempts to convert the Jews; since they for the most part did not want to convert, expulsion was then tried, and lastly, the third, most radical method followed, the physical exter- mination of the Jews (pp. 14f.; DEJ , p. 8). Hilberg summarizes his theory by means of creative declarations: ìThe missionaries of Christianity had said in effect: You have no right to live among us as Jews. The secular rulers who followed had pro- claimed: You have no right to live among us. The German Nazis at last decreed: You have no right to live.î (p. 15; DEJ , p. 9) Hilberg declares that it was in Germany that enmity to the Jews reached its most extreme pitch was no accident, since it was part of a long tradition in Germany. In his time, Martin Luther had been a bitter opponent of the Jews, as his essay Von den Juden und ihren L ̧gen shows (On the Jews and Their Lies, published in 1543; Hilberg pp. 22ff.; DEJ , p. 15). From Luther Hilberg goes on to the German anti-Semites of the 19th Cen- tury and to the Jew-hating idealogy of National Socialism. Next he com- ments on the Jewish reaction to undergoing recurring persecutions: Jews reacted to these always with ì alleviation and compliance î (p. 34; DEJ , p. 27). In the Third Reich this became their doom: 8 To reduce the number of footnotes, whenever I cite Hilberg, the page number of the updated German version is given in parentheses. Page numbers of the English original are tagged with DEJ ."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY ìWhen the Nazis took over in 1933, the old Jewish reaction pattern set in again, but this time the results were catastrophic. The German bureau- cracy was not slowed by Jewish pleading; it was not stopped by Jewish indispensablility. Without regard to cost, the bureaucratic machine, operat- ing with accelerating speed and ever-widening destructive effect, proceded to annihilate the European Jews. The Jewish community, unable to switch to resistance, increased its cooperation with the tempo of the German mea- sures, thus hastening its own destruction. We see, therefore, that both perpetrators and victims drew upon their age-old experience in dealing with each other. The Germans did it with suc- cess. the Jews did it with disaster.î (p. 35; DEJ , p. 28) As we see, at the beginning of his large work, Hilberg provides his- torical, psychological and philosophical observations on the history leading to the extermination of the Jewsó for which he has at this point provided no proof, but which he assumes to be axiomatic . In effect, he harnesses the wagon before the horse. The proper scholarly method would have been to clarify the facts before going on to philosophize over what brought them about. After the second chapter (ì Antecedents î) in which the anti-Jewish measures undertaken after the seizure of power of the NSDAP are described, Hilberg turns to ì The Structure of Destruction î (pp. 56ff.; DEJ , pp. 51ff.). As components of the ì Destruction Process î he includes: ñ The definition of the concept ëJewí by the National Socialists (pp. 69-84; DEJ , pp. 63-80) and the prohibition on the mixing of Ary- ans and Jews; ñ The dispossession of Jews (pp. 85-163; DEJ , pp. 81-154); ñ The concentration of Jews in designated dwelling quarters, mainly ghettos, which first affected Jews living in the area of the prewar Reich and in the Protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia and sub- sequently affected Jews from the Polish territories conquered in 1939. In this chapter Hilberg relies almost exclusively on solid and accessi- ble sources, so the facts he describes here are mostly not disputable. This part of the work constitutes a useful documentation of the step-by-step dis- franchisement of the Jews under NS rule. However, there is a swindle as to names going on here that is somewhat offensive. Discrimination, disposses- sion and ghettoization of a minority are not components of an ì annihilation policy î.

R EMARKS ON THE F IRST V OLUME even more in Israeli occupied territoriesóthey were by no means annihi- lated . Hilberg is creating a deliberate confusion of ideas. This is not the only example of dishonesty that we encounter in the first volume. On pp. 221f. ( DEJ , p. 212), in connection with the removal of German Jews to the East, Hilberg writes: ìIn October 1941, mass deportations began in the Reich. They did not end until the destruction process was over. The object of these move- ments was not emigration but the destruction of the Jews. As yet, however, there were no killing centers in which the victims could be gassed to death, and so it was decided that, pending the construction of death camps, the Jews were to be dumped into ghettos of the incorporated territories and the occupied Soviet areas further east. The target in the incorporated territories was the ghetto of £ Ûd º .î Hilberg still owes his readers a proof for this assertion. While the entire process of the removal of German Jews to the East can be docu- mented up one side and down the otheróand Hilberg mostly relies on Ger- man original documents in his numerous footnotesóhe does not cite any document as source for the above assertion, nor even any witness testimony. The passage just cited is one of the first clear examples of a dishonest tactic that Hilberg employs frequently in the second volume: He embeds undocumented assertions (or assertions supported only by questionable wit- ness testimony) on annihilation of Jews among properly documented state- ments on persecution of Jews or deportation of Jews and may have hoped that the reader will not catch him. In the case above the illogic of his asser- tion can be grasped with both hands, especially when regarded in context. On pages 215-225 ( DEJ , 205-214), Hilberg describes the logistical and organizational difficulties caused by the improvised mass removals of Ger- man Jews to the West Polish territories incorporated in the Reich in 1939 and to the Generalgouvernement and how furiously the local NS authorities repelled these removals. For example, Werner Ventzki, Chief Mayor of the city of £ Ûd º , renamed Litzmannstadt, protested vehemently against the plan Reichsf ̧hrer SS Heinrich Himmler was considering in September 1941 to deport 20,000 Jews and 5,000 gypsies to the £ Ûd º ghetto, from which they were to be shipped further East the following year. Ventzki insisted that the arrival of 25,000 more persons in the ghetto, which was already full to over- flowing, would raise the density of occupation to seven persons per room, that the new arrivals would have to be lodged in factories, which would dis- rupt production, that people would starve and that it would be impossible to prevent epidemics (pp. 222f.; DEJ , pp. 212f.). Nevertheless, the removal went forward."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY If the purpose of the deportations was ì not emigration but the destruction of the Jews î, as Hilberg asserts, the National Socialist policy of removal of the Jews to the East before the completion of the ëdeath campsí becomes senseless. According to Hilbergís book, the two first ëdeath campsí, Che ≥ mno and Be ≥ø ec, became operational in December 1941 and in March 1942, respectively (p. 956; DEJ , p. 893). In that case, I ask: why would the Germans send massive numbers of Jews into the ghettos starting in October 1941 to wait for the ëdeath campsí to become operational, instead of holding off on the deportations for three or four months to save themselves the organizational headaches and the chaos in the ghettos? Hil- berg does not bother to discuss obvious questions of this sort. Nevertheless, the first volume of The Destruction of the European Jews represents a well-researched documentation on the destiny of the Jews in the Third Reich from 1933 to 1941. People may disagree as to the inter- pretation of the factsóbut we are interested only in the facts themselves, and, unlike Hilberg, we refrain from random philosophizing. It is an abuse for Hilberg to classify the measures taken by the NS regime during this period as ì annihilation policy îóthey clearly do not fall under that heading."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19 IV. The Lack of Documents on Annihilation Policy and its Consequences for the Orthodox Historians 1. ì No Documents Have Survived î That no one has ever found a written order for the physical extermi- nation of the Jews originating with Adolf Hitler or any other leading NS politician is agreed upon by historians of all orientations. LÈon Poliakov, one of the most prominent proponents of the orthodox picture of the ëHolo- caustí, stated unequivocally: 9 ìThe archives of the Third Reich and the depositions and accounts of its leaders make possible a reconstruction, down to the last detail, of the ori- gin and development of the plans for aggression, the military campaigns, and the whole array of procedures by which the Nazis intended to reshape the world to their liking. Only the campaign to exterminate the Jews, as regards its conception as well as many other essential aspects, remains shrouded in darkness. Inferences, psychological considerations, and third- or fourth-hand reports enable us to reconstruct its development with consid- erable accuracy. Certain details, however, must remain forever unknown. The three or four people chiefly involved in the actual drawing up of the plan for total extermination are dead and no documents have survived, per- haps none ever existed.î Nothing needs to be changed in this statement. At a congress of histo- rians held in Stuttgart in 1984 covering ì The Murder of the Jews in the Sec- ond World War î, the participants reached agreement on only one point, namely that a written order for the annihilation had never been found. 10 This circumstance has caused historical researchers headaches for a long time. A gigantic operation such as the deportation of several millions of Jews into ëextermination campsí and their murder there necessarily pre- supposes an organization which must have involved the participation of thousands upon thousands of persons, and such a thing does not happen 9 LÈon Poliakov, Harvest of Hate , Holocaust Library, New York 1979, p. 108. 10 Eberhard J‰ckel and J ̧rgen Rohwer (eds.), Der Mord an den Juden im Zweiten Weltkrieg , Deutsche Verlagsanstalt, Stuttgart 1985, p. 186."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY without written ordersóespecially not in such a bureacratically organized state as the Third Reich was. The National Socialists mostly did not destroy their documents as the war came to an end; rather, these fell in huge amounts into the hands of the victors. In his well-known book Rise and Fall of the Third Reich , 11 William L. Shirer describes how this resulted in: ì [Ö] the capture of most of the confidential archives of the German government and all its branches, including those of the Foreign Office, the Army, the Navy, the National Socialist Party and Heinrich Himmlerís secret police. Never before, I believe, has such a vast treasure fallen into the hands of contemporary historians. [Ö] The swift collapse of the Third Reich in spring of 1945 resulted in the surrender not only of a vast bulk of its secret papers but of other priceless material such as private diaries, highly secret speeches, conference reports and correspondence, and even transcripts of telephone conversations of the NS leaders tapped by a special office set up by Hermann Goering in the Air Ministry. [Ö] 485 tons of records of the German Foreign Office, captured by the U.S. First Army in various castles and mines in the Harz Mountains just as they were about to be burned on orders from Berlin [Ö] Hundreds of thousands of captured documents were hurriedly assembled at Nuremberg as evidence in the trial of the major war criminals.î In view of this mountain of NS documents, the lack of any documen- tary proof for a policy of annihilation of the Jews is painfully embarrassing for the proponents of the official picture of the ëHolocaustí. The argument that at least in the ëextermination campsí the incriminating papers were destroyed in time is useless, especially since 1991: In that year the Soviets made available to Western researchers the documents of the Central Con- struction Office in Auschwitz captured by the Red Army in 1945. The Cen- tral Construction Office was an organization that was responsible for the construction of the crematoriesóthe crematories which supposedly con- tained the gas chambers for the mass killing of Jews. There are no less than 88,000 pages of documents. 12 They do not contain any evidence for the con- struction of homicidal gas chambers. If there had been, the Communists would have announced it to the world triumphantly in 1945. The complete lack of documentary evidence for a policy of annihila- tion of the Jews as well as for the construction of gas chambers for killing purposes has led to a split in the ranks of the orthodox historians, meaning those who uphold the theory of the deliberate and systematic annihilation of 11 William L.

T HE L ACK OF D OCUMENTS AND ITS C ONSEQUENCES the Jews, between Intentionalists and Functionalists. In what follows we will compare the two orientations. 2. Intentionalists and Functionalists At a colloquium on ì Nazi Germany and the Genocide of the Jews î held at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1982, US historian Christopher Browning summarized the difference of opinion between Intentionalists and Function- alists with respect to the genesis of the policy of annihilation of the Jews as follows: 13 ìIn recent years the interpretations of National Socialism have polarized more and more into two groups that Tim Mason has aptly called ëIntentionalistsí and ëFunctionalistsí. The former explain the development of Nazi Germany as a result of Hitlerís intentions, which came out of a coherent and logical ideology and were realized due to an all-powerful totalitarian dictatorship. The ëFunctionalistsí point out the anarchistic character of the Nazi state, its internal rivalries and the chaotic process of decision-making, which constantly led to improvisation and radicalization [Ö] These two modes of exposition of history are useful for the analysis of the strongly divergent meanings that people attribute to the Jewish policy of the Nazis in general and to the Final Solution in particular. On the one hand, Lucy Dawidowicz, a radical Intentionalist, upholds the viewpoint that already in 1919 Hitler had decided to exterminate European Jews. And not only that: He knew at what point in time his murderous plan would be real- ized. The Second World War was at the same time the means and opportu- nity to put his ëwar against the Jewsí into effect. While he waited for the anticipated moment for the realization of his ëgreat planí, naturally he toler- ated a senseless and meaningless pluralism in the Jewish policies of the sub- ordinate ranks of state and party. Against the radical Intentionalism of Lucy Dawidowicz, which emphasizes the intentions and ëgreat planí of Hitler, the Ultrafunctionalism of Martin Broszat constitutes a diametrically opposed view of the role of the F ̧hrer, especially with respect to the decision on the Final Solution. It is Broszatís position that Hitler never took a definitive decision nor issued a general order for the Final Solution. The annihilation program developed in stages in conjunction with a series of isolated massacres at the end of 1941 and in 1942. These locally limited mass murders were improvised answers to an impossible situation that had developed as a result of two factors: First the ideological and political pressure for the creation of a ëJew-freeí Europe that stemmed from Hitler and then the military reverses on the east- 13 Christopher Browning, ì La dÈcision concernant la solution finale î, in: Colloque de líEcole des Hautes Etudes en sciences sociales, LíAllemagne nazie et le gÈnocide juif , Gallimard-Le Seuil, Paris 1985, pp. 191f."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY ern front that led to stoppages in railway traffic and caused the buffer zones into which the Jews were to be removed to disappear. Once the annihilation program was in progress, it gradually institutionalized itself until it was noticed that it offered the simplest solution logistically and became a pro- gram universally applied and single-mindedly pursued. From this stand- point, Hitler was a catalyst but not a decision-maker. For Lucy Dawidowicz the Final Solution was thought out twenty years before it was put into practice; For Martin Broszat the idea developed from practiceósporadic murders of groups of Jews led to the idea to kill all Jews systematically.î The constructions described by Browning of Lucy Dawidowicz and Martin Broszat as extreme representatives of the Intentionalists and the Functionalists are both equally untenable. First as to the theory propounded by Lucy Dawidowicz that the exter- mination of the Jews was the ì great plan î of Hitler long before his acces- sion to power. If this were so, Hitler would never have pursued for years on end a single-minded demand for Jewish emigration. It is undisputed that NS policy during the six years of peace that the Third Reich enjoyed was directed at motivating as many Jews as possible to emigrate. To achieve this aim, as is well known, the National Socialists worked closely with Zionist forces, who were interested in the settlement of as many Jews as possible in Palestine. 14 However, the number of Jews who were willing to risk an uncertain future in the Orient was limited. Raul Hilberg has described in detail how intensively the National Socialists pushed Jewish emigration. He relates how the National Socialists exerted themselves to persuade ten thousand Polish Jews who still lived in Germany in 1938 (!) to return to Poland and how the latter refused to take back its Jewish fellow citizens (p. 413; DEJ , p. 394). One should take note that after five years of Hitlerís rule ten thousand Polish Jews preferred con- ditions in the anti-Semitic Third Reich to those of their native Poland! At the time of Hitlerís accession to power 520,000 Jews lived in Ger- many. Due to emigration and an excess of deaths over births, by 1938 their number had dwindled to 350,000, but the Anschluss with Austria brought an additional 190,000 Austrian Jews (p. 412; DEJ , p. 394). In response, on 26th August 1938 Reichskommissar B ̧rckelóhe had administrative responsibility for the reunion of Austria and the Reichóset up a ì Central Office for Jewish Emigration î. B ̧rckelís method was soon followed throughout the Reich. On 24th January 1939 Gˆring ordered the founding 14 On National Socialist-Zionist cooperation see, for example, Edwin Black, The Transfer Agreement , New York-London 1994; Francis Nicosia, Hitler und der Zionismus , Druffel Verlag, Leoni 1989."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23 IV.

Therefore the NS lead- ers turned their attention to the Madagascar Plan. On this subject Raul Hil- berg comments: ìThe Madagascar Project was designed to take care of millions of Jews. The authors of the plan wanted to empty the Reich-Protektorate area and all of occupied Poland of their Jewish population. [Ö] But the Madagascar Plan did not materialize. It hinged on the con- clusion of a peace treaty with France, and such a treaty depended on an end of hostilities with England. [Ö] Even as it faded, the project was to be mentioned one more time, dur- ing early February 1941, in Hitlerís headquarters. On that occasion, the partyís labor chief, Ley, brought up the Jewish question and Hitler, answer- ing at length, pointed out that the war was going to accelerate the solution of this problem but that he was also encountering additional difficulties. Originally he had been in a position to address himself at most to the Jews of Germany, but now the goal had to be the elimination of Jewish influence in the entire Axis power sphere [Ö] He was going to approach the French about Madagascar. When Bormann asked how the Jews could be trans- ported there in the middle of the war, Hitler replied that one would have to consider that. He would be willing to make available the entire German fleet for this purpose, but he did not wish to expose his crews to the torpedoes of enemy submarines.î (pp. 416f.; DEJ , pp. 397f.) Had Hitler, as Lucy Dawidowicz and other Intentionalists claim, planned for the extermination of the Jews and even foreseen that this goal could be achieved in the framework of a world war, he would never have made any efforts to encourage Jewish emigration and would have blocked any such efforts especially after the war had begun. There would never have been anything like a Madagascar Plan sponsored by the NS leadership. Emigrated Jews are not subject to extermination. The opposing theory, that of the radical Functionalists around Broszat, stands in irreconcilable contradiction with the claims of the adher- ents of the theory of Jewish annihilation and also with other claims of the Functionalists themselves. As Browning summarized in his presentation at the 1982 Paris Collo- quium, Broszat believes that local massacres of Jews led to the plan to kill"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY all Jews; thus the idea developed from the practical situation itself. The mil- itary reverses on the eastern front had caused the buffer zones to disappear in which it was intended to remove the Jews. This contradicts the view held by the orthodox historians that the mass murders behind the eastern front began in earnest immediately after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The largest of the claimed mass shootings, that of Babi Yar near Kiev, supposedly happened on 29th September 1941, at a time when the Wehrmacht had suffered no significant reverses. All Jews in Kiev the Ger- mans could get their hands on, in total more than 33,000, were supposedly shot in Babi Yar. In the following months tens of thousands more Jewish victims allegedly followed them. 15 One cannot exclude that there were shootings of Jews shortly after the beginning of the German-Soviet War, and we will discuss this question in the next chapter. For the most part they were reprisals for attacks of parti- sans against German troops. (The ì Commissar Order î for the shooting of Jewish-Bolshevist commissars is not pertinent here, because it deals with the killing of individual persons identified by function and not the indis- criminate slaughter of civilians because of their ëraceí.) A monstrous blood- bath like that claimed for Babi Yar could never have happened without the permission of the highest authority. No local commander would have dared to undertake a measure fraught with such heavy consequences without assurance of support from higher authority. Thus, the alleged murder of all Jews remaining in Kiev after the Germans entered would only be conceiv- able as a component of a planned extermination policy. Also, if the Babi Yar story is true, such a policy must have already existed by the end of Septem- ber 1941. Let us pursue this argument further. Che ≥ mno (Kulmhof in German) is supposed to have been opened as the first ëextermination campí in December 1941 (Hilberg, p. 956; DEJ , p. 893). If Hilberg is right, the order to build it must have been issued some time before, because a camp does not spring up overnight. Now it is not possible that some random local Ger- man authorities decided on their own account to build an extermination camp. But here also, the existence of an order from higher authority is an absolute precondition. This implies the bankruptcy of Broszatís Functionalist theory, in which the Holocaust comes about as the result of the first German reverses 15 For the official description of Babi Yar see E.R.

In his presentation at the Paris Colloquium, Christopher Browning added the following to his description of the theories of Lucy Dawidowicz and Martin Broszat: 16 ìBetween these two extreme poles there are a number of positions occupying interpretive middle ground. Eberhard J‰ckel believes the idea for the killing of the Jews came to Hitler some time around 1924. Karl Dietrich Bracher emphasizes Hitlerís threatening declarations at the end of the ë30ís and believes his intentions were already settled. Andreas Hillgruber and Klaus Hildebrand maintain that ideological factors were controlling, but do not propose any firm date. Others, and not Functionalists only, believe the decisive point was in 1941; LÈon Poliakov thinks that the beginning of 1941 is the most probable point, while Robert Kempner and Helmut Krausnick hold the opinion that Hitler made the decision in the Spring, while prepara- tions for the invasion of Russia were under way. [Ö] Uwe Dietrich Adam inclines to the idea that the decision was taken in the Fall, at a time when the military offensive had stalled and the ëterritorial solutioní through mass expulsion to Russia became impossible. Finally, Sebastian Haffner, who is certainly no Functionalist, defends the date of the beginning of December, when the first foreboding of a military defeat drove Hitler to strive for an irrevocable victory over the Jews.î These observations expose with harsh clarity the chronological trav- esties by the orthodox ëHolocaustí historians, which reduce them to idle, conspiratorial speculations in cuckoo land. All the proposed dates lack any serious foundation, in that there is not one with any documentary support. Instead of indulging in useless speculation as to a point in time when the annihilation of the Jews was decided upon, these academics would have done better to study the question first, whether such a thing ever existed. This cardinal question was prudently avoided at the Paris historiansí con- gress as well as at the Stuttgart historiansí congress held two years later. At the latter as well, the question of the date when the fateful decision was made was tortured to death. The congress participants came no nearer an answer then than two years before in Paris. It is notable that none of the researchers named by Browning held to the old fairy tale that the decision for the annihilation of the Jews was taken at the Wannsee Conference in Berlin on 20th January 1942. In 1992 the Israeli ëHolocaustí expert Yehuda Bauer derided this tough old myth as a ì silly story .î 17 16 Christopher Browning, op. cit.

Was There the Ominous Hitler Order or Not? On the cardinal question, whether Hitler ever gave an express order for the physical extinction of the Jews present in his area of control, Hilberg gives different answers in the first and in the revised edition of his work. In the first edition published in 1961 he asserted that there had been two suc- cessive Hitler orders to this effect, the first regarding the killing of Russian Jews and the second regarding the annihilation of all other Jews living under German rule. He gave no documentary proof for these orders. We quote the relevant passage: 18 ìHow was the killing phase brought about? Basically, we are dealing with two of Hitlerís decisions. One order was given in the spring of 1941, during the planning of the invasion of the USSR; it provided that small units of the SS and Police be dispatched to Soviet territory, where they were to move from town to town to kill all Jewish inhabitants on the spot. This method may be called the ëmobile killing operationsí. Shortly after the mobile operations had begun in the occupied Soviet territories, Hitler handed down his second order. That decision doomed the rest of European Jewry.î In the second and ì definitive î edition which appeared in 1985, on which the German translation we use was based, both of these phantom orders disappear without a trace. Christopher Browning, to his credit, remarked on this in an article written in 1986: 19 ìIn the new edition, all references in the text to a Hitler decision or Hitler order for the ëFinal Solutioní [which Browning understands to mean physical extermination] have been systematically excised.î This is a devastating blow to Hilbergís credibility! Of course, Hilberg still assumes that Hitler had initiated the annihilation of the Jews. In 1985, he wrote: ìFor years, the administrative machine had taken its initiatives and engaged in its forays one step at a time. In the course of that evolution, a direction had been charted and a pattern had been established. By the mid- dle of 1941, the dividing line had been reached, and beyond it lay a field of unprecedented actions unhindered by the limits of the past. More and more of the participants were on the verge of realizing the nature of what could happen now. Salient in this crystallization was the role of Adolf Hitler him- 18 Raul Hilberg, The Destruction of the European Jews , Quadrangle Books, Chicago 1967, p. 177.

Behind these turgid passages hides the presupposition that Hitler per- sonally commanded the annihilation of the Jews. One could therefore describe Hilberg as a ëmoderate Intentionalistí. The informant upon whom he relies is Adolf Eichmann. The latter wrote in his memoirs that at the turn of the year 1941/1942 Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the RSHA, told him that the F ̧hrer had decreed the physical destruction of the Jews. 20 Hilberg says this in footnote 30 on pp. 420f. ( DEJ , p. 402), and continues: ìDuring his interrogation by Israeli police in Jerusalem, he [Eich- mann] suggested more plausibly that Hitlerís order had come two or three months after the June 22 German assault on the USSR. [Ö] Chronology and circumstances point to a Hitler decision before the summer ended.î That such a crucial statement could be relegated to a footnote gives some inkling of Hilbergís helpless perplexity! Hilberg now relies on a sug- gestion(!) from Eichmann, who himself relied on alleged hearsay evidence! At the Stuttgart Congress in 1984 Hilberg again opined that Hitler had given the decision for the extermination of the Jewsónaturally, only verbally!óin Summer 1941. 21 The date given by Hilberg is after February 1941, when the Madagascar Plan was seriously considered for the last time, but before the claimed massacre of Babi Yar and the alleged beginning of operations of the ëextermination campí Che ≥ mno. By so doing, Hilberg avoided the radical impossibilities on which the theories of Lucy Dawidow- icz and Martin Broszat were so weakly founded. Just as little as Dawidowicz, Broszat and all other Intentionalist and Functionalist ëHolocaustí historians, Hilberg cannot produce even a single document to support his hypothesis. Moreover, he contradicts himself in that he repeatedly conjures up an ì annihilation policy î, an ì annihilation process î and ì annihilation machinery î before the beginning of the Ger- man-Soviet war. In connection with the last deliberations by Hitler on the Madagascar Plan that happened in February 1941, he writes: ìWhile Hitler was thinking, the machinery of destruction was perme- ated with a feeling of uncertainty. In the Generalgouvernement, where ghet- toization was viewed as a transitional measure, the unsightly Jewish quarters with their impoverished crowds were trying the patience of local German officials. These irritations and frustrations were expressed in monthly reports by the late summer of 1940.

Elementary, my dear Watson! b. ì No Special Agency ... No Special Budget î An annihilation policy necessarily presupposes a mechanism for its execution, and this mechanism must needs be held in the hands of a central authority invested with the requisite powers. But no, Hilberg says there was no such thing; already in the first volume he has written: ìIn the final analysis, the destruction of the Jews was not so much a product of laws and commands as it was a matter of spirit, of shared com- prehension, of consonance and synchronization. Who shared in this undertaking? What kind of machinery was used for these tasks? The machine of destruction was an aggregateóno one agency was charged with the whole operation. [Ö] No special agency was created and no special budget was devised to destroy the Jews of Europe. Each organization was to play a specific role in the process, and each was to find the means to carry out its task.î (pp. 58, 66; DEJ , pp. 55, 62) Picture that: a project for a mammoth undertakingócomplicated by the conditions of waróincluding the construction of ëextermination campsí and the deportation of millions of persons from every which country into the campsóand this all should be done without a responsible central authority, a special office or a special budget! Raul Hilberg took part in the Paris Historianís Congress in 1982; the subject of his presentation was ì The Bureaucracy of the Final Solution î. Hilberg revealed what would have been necessary to carry out the annihila- tion of the Jews, namely, 1) railroads, 2) police, and especially 3) dedicated bureaucrats. 22 How sophisticated! When a state has decided to deport millions of persons from every which country by train to death factories and then to kill them there, it would in fact need railroads to carry the trains, it would cer- tainly need policemen to guard the condemned ones, and its bureaucrats 22 Hilbergís paper is included in LíAllemagne nazie et le gÈnocide juif , op. cit.

One does not have to be a professor at the University of Vermont to understand this nor to have written the standard work on the ëHolocaustí. The banalities hawked by Hilberg do not in any way replace the missing proof of an extermination policy. c. The Myth of the Code Language Lacking documentary proof for a German policy of annihilation of the Jews, Hilberg resorts to a dodge, one that has enjoyed great popularity among orthodox ëHolocaustí scholars for a long time and whose origin can be traced back to the Nuremberg Trials. The Italian researcher Carlo Mat- togno characterizes it as follows: 23 ìThe Nuremberg inquisitors invented [Ö] this roundabout method of speaking, which consisted in reading into any particular document that which one wanted it to say. This method is the basis for theóarbitrary and unfoundedóassumption that the high NS authorities used a form of code language even in their most secret documents, which the Nuremberg inquis- itors naturally claimed they had the key to. This was the reason for the sys- tematic twisting of the meaning of otherwise quite innocent documents for the purpose of supporting the extermination theory.î Here is an example. Along with the Wannsee Conference, at which Hitlerís decision to annihilate the Jews was to be disclosed to an at first small circle of NS bureaucratsóthis is Hilbergís version of the purpose of this conferenceósupposedly, ìGradually the news of the ëFinal Solutioní seeped through the ranks of the bureaucracy. The knowledge did not come to all officials at once. How much a man knew depended on his proximity to the destructive operations and on his insight into the nature of the destruction process. Seldom, how- ever, was comphrehension recorded on paper. When the bureaucrats had to deal with deportation matters, they kept referring to a ëJewish migrationí. In official correspondence the Jews were still ëwanderingí. They were ëevacu- atedí ( evakuiert ) and ëresettledí ( umgesiedelt, ausgesiedelt ). They ëwan- dered off í ( wanderten ab ) and ëdisappearedí ( verschwanden ). These terms were not the product of naÔvetÈ, but convenient tools of psychological repression.î (p. 425; DEJ , p. 406) That expressions such as ì resettle î ( aussiedeln ), ì evacuate î ( evaku- ieren ) and so forth can only be code language for ëkillí is, of course, nothing but an allegation. Moreover, even Hilberg had to admit that even after the supposed Hitler decision to exterminate the Jews, many Jews were removed to the occupied territories in the East, which one may certainly describe as 23 Carlo Mattogno, La soluzione finale. Problemi e polemiche , Edizioni di Ar, Padua 1991, pp. 64f."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY ëresettlementí ( Aussiedlung ). For example, he relates the deportation of German Jews to Riga and Minsk (p. 369; DEJ , p. 352). Germanyís worsen- ing circumstances in the war made the continuance of this policy impossi- ble. If the authorities had wanted to kill these German Jews, there could have been no good reason to haul them off to Latvia and White Russia in the always urgently needed trains instead of killing them in Germany itself or sending them to one of the ëextermination campsí even then (November 1941) supposedly being built in Poland. It hardly needs to be mentioned that for Hilberg the term ì final solu- tion î ( Endlˆsung ) stands as a synonym for ëexterminationí ( Ausrottung ). For example, this is the sense in which he interprets Gˆringís well-known letter to Heydrich on 31st July 1942, frequently quoted in the literature on the subject, in which the former orders the latter to submit, ì in the near future an overall plan of the organizational, functional and material mea- sures to be taken in preparing for the implementation of the aspired final solution of the Jewish question î. 24 Hilberg adds, Heydrich now held ì the reins of the destruction process in his hands î (p. 420; DEJ , p. 401). Gˆringís expression, that Heydrich should ì undertake, by emigration or evacuation, a solution of the Jewish question as advantageous as possible under the conditions at the time î, Hilberg interprets the same way as his predecessors from Poliakov to Reitlinger as code language for physical annihilation. No serious historian who wrote on an era other than the Third Reich and the Second World War would be permitted to distort the state- ments of his original sources so capriciously. That the National Socialists took ì final solution of the Jewish ques- tion î ( Endlˆsung der Judenfrage ) to mean the expulsion ( Ausweisung ) or removal ( Abschiebung ) of all Jews from Europe, can be shown by a number of documents. For example, Franz Rademacher, official in charge of Jewish affairs in the Germany Section of the Foreign Office on 10th February 1942, and thus at a time when according to Hilberg the mass murder was allegedly in full swing, and Be ≥ø ec, following Che ≥ mno, was close to opening as the second extermination camp, wrote a letter to a Herr Bielfeld of the Foreign Ministry in which he stated that the F ̧hrer had decided that ì the Jews should be removed not to Madagascar, but to the East î, and added, ì Mada- gascar will no longer be needed for the final solution î. 25 Not even the Giant Raul Hilberg has dared to claim that the Germans planned to gas the Jews in 24 PS-710. 25 NG-5770."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31 IV. T HE L ACK OF D OCUMENTS AND ITS C ONSEQUENCES the jungles of Madagascar. And why does Hilberg omit such major pieces of documentary evidence? d. Hitler Quotation as ëProofí for the Mass Murder As do other proponents of the orthodox picture of the ëHolocaustí, Hilberg interprets statements by Adolf Hitler in which he threatens the Jews with ì annihilation î ( Vernichtung ) or ì extermination î ( Ausrottung ) as proof that such a thing really happened. He quotes (on p. 425; DEJ , p. 407) a Hit- ler speech of 30th September 1942 in which the Reichschancellor stated as follows: 26 ìIn my Reichstag speech of September 1, 1939, I have spoken of two things: first, that now that the war has been forced upon us, no array of weapons and no passage of time will will bring us to defeat, and second, that if Jewry should plot another world war to exterminate [ zur Ausrottung ] the Aryan peoples of Europe, it would not be the Aryan peoples which would be exterminated, [ ausgerottet ] but Jewry. [Ö] At one time, the Jews of Ger- many laughed about my prophecies. I do not know whether they are still laughing or whether they have already lost all desire to laugh. But right now I can only repeat: they will stop laughing everywhere, and I shall be right also in that prophecy.î It needs to be noted that a warlike way of speaking was characteristic of the National Socialists, who before coming to power had to prevail against their adversaries on the extreme left in countless clashes in meeting rooms and streets. It should also be remembered that wild threats against an enemy in wartime are common. But the important point is a semantic one. In present usage, ausrotten means only ëto physically liquidateí, but for- merly the wordówhose etymology is ëuprootíóhad a broader meaning. Thus in Mein Kampf Adolf Hitler wrote the following on conditions in the Danube Monarchy before the First World War: 27 ìImmense were the burdens which the German people were expected to bear, inconceivable their sacrifices in taxes and blood, and yet anyone who was not totally blind was bound to recognize that all this would be in vain. What pained us most was the fact that this entire system was morally whitewashed by the alliance with Germany, with the result that the slow extermination [ Ausrottung ] of Germandom in the old monarchy was in a certain sense sanctioned by Germany itself.î Now Hitler certainly did not mean to say that old Kaiser Franz Josef planned to gas or shoot all the German Austrians, but rather that they ran the 26 Vˆlkischer Beobachter , 30th September 1942. 27 Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf , Franz Eher Verlag, Munich 1933, pp. 13f."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY danger of losing their power to the Slavs. Ausrotten clearly possessed the meaning ëdeprive of power, rob of influence.í The reader should also remember that on 1st September 1939 Hitler criticized the Jews for wanting to let loose a world war for the ì elimination of the Aryan peoples î ( Ausrottung der arischen Vˆlker ). It cannot be seri- ously contended that he meant to say the Jews intended the eradication of the entire population of Europe root and branch. Here again ìAusrottungî means ësubjectioní or ëdeprivation of powerí. This meaning applies to all such endlessly distorted Hitler quotations in the ëHolocaustí literature. e. Two Insoluble Problems As do all other radical or moderate Intentionalists, Hilberg faces two insuperable problems which he simply ignores: 1. If the National Socialists had decided at any time on the physical liquidation of Jews present in their area of control, from that time forward there would be no documents which spoke of deployment of Jewish labor. However, such documents exist in large numbers. We will quote from a few of them later in discussing the deportations. 28 The following problem is even more insoluble for the Intentionalists: 2. If there had been a systematic policy of annihilation of the Jews there would have been effectively no Jews left in the territories in the con- trol of the Third Reich. Every Jew the Germans could have gotten their hands on would have been killed and the few survivors would have had to ascribe their survival to ëchanceí or ëmiracleí. In reality, the majority of the Jewish population in the countries occupied by the Third Reich avoided any deportation. It is well-known that from France only slightly more than 20% of the Jews were deported, most of whom were foreigners and lacked proper identification. Jews with French passports were mostly left alone. The same applies to those with Belgian passports. Under any extermination policy there would have been effectively none who returned and we would not have on hand the uncounted ëtestimonies of Holocaust survivorsí that now fill whole libraries. 29 28 Cf. chapter VI.2. 29 According to Israeli sources, there were some 1,000,000 ëHolocaust survivorsí still alive in 1998, which equals some 4-5 million ësurvivorsí in 1945!

That there were even ëwildí shootings, which is to say, shootings that were done not as a reaction to attacks by par- tisans, can hardly be excluded. It is also not disputed that many Jewish- Communist commissars were killed because of Hitlerís 1941 ì Commissar Order ,î which was only reluctantly applied by German officers in the East and which was abrogated in early 1942. In addition, thousands of Jews were killed in pogroms initiated by the native populations following the German invasion. After they had been freed from the Bolshevist yoke, Latvians, Lithuanians, Ukrainians and others took revenge on Jews because the Red terror machinery had been led mainly by Jews, and this retribution unfortu- nately fell also on Jews who had had nothing to do with the Communist crimes. 37 The orthodox historians are telling us that the Germans carried out an actual war of extermination against the Jews.

In what follows we will crit- ically examine the arguments Raul Hilberg has made in support of this the- sis. First, however, we need to summarize what Hilberg says happened to Soviet Jews in the German-occupied territories. 2. Hilbergís Version of German Jewish Policy in the Occupied Soviet Territories Raul Hilberg states that the mass murders of Soviet Jews began in August 1941; he writes: ìAt first the kommandos undertook no mass shootings nor made vic- tims of whole families. They had not yet become habituated to routine kill- 35 Of 531 leading personalities in the Soviet Union in 1920, 447 were Jews, cf. Juri K. Begunov, Tajnye Sily w istorii Rossij , Isdatelstvo Imeni A.S. Syborina, St. Petersburg 1996. 36 Die Enzyklop‰die des Holocaust (ed. by Eberhard J‰ckel, Peter Longerich and Julius H. Schoeps, Argon Verlag, Berlin 1993) contains this comment: ì The partisan groups [in the USSR] often formed spontaneously. Many units consisted largely of Jewish fighters .î (p. 1348). 37 All six main architects of the Communist slave camp system were Jews (Alexander Solschenizyn, Der Archipel Gulag , Scherz Verlag, Bern 1974, photographic section). 38 Stuttgart 1981."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"37 V. T HE M ASSACRES ON THE E ASTERN F RONT ing. Because of the influence of centuries-old traditions they did not consider their orders as all-encompassing. They took the word ëJewí to mean men only. The mass killings started only in August 1941.î (p. 307; DEJ , na) The ì Kommandos î belonged to the four Einsatzgruppen , which had been formed before the war and were intended to secure German rear areas, meaning they were to fight partisans operating behind the lines. According to Hilberg, they had two further responsibilities. Referring to an affidavit made after the war by Otto Ohlendorf, leader of Einsatzgruppe D , 39 he writes: ìAccording to Ohlendorf, the commanders of the Einsatzgruppen were briefed by Himmler personally. They were informed that an important part of their task was the elimination (Beseitigung) of Jewsówomen, men and childrenóand of Communist functionaries. 26 î (p. 303; DEJ , p. 290) Also, Hilberg says, the Einsatzgruppen were to comb the POW camps for persons they should shoot. Heydrich had ordered the sorting out of all ì professional revolutionaries î, Red Army political officers, ì fanatical Communists î and ì all Jews î, and the Einsatzgruppen did the major part of this work (p. 351; DEJ , p. 335). The four Einsatzgruppen numbered 3,000 men altogether, including a few noncombatants, such as interpreters and radio operators (pp. 302f.; DEJ , p. 289). The first ì killing sweep î, which began in August 1941, lasted until December of the same year, but before it was over a second killing sweep had already begunóin the falló, whose purpose was the seizure and liqui- dation of Jews who had been overlooked. In addition to the Einsatzgruppen , Gestapo members from Tilsit, Ein- satzkommandos from the Generalgouvernement and improvised Komman- dos of the Higher SS and Police Leaders cooperated in the second killing sweep. (p. 312; DEJ , p. 298). The mass shootings followed the same pattern, apart from minor vari- ations: Jews would be taken from the cities where most of them lived to pits lying on the outskirts of the citiesósome of which already existed, the rest of which were dug for the purposeóand murdered there. Frequently there were five or six layers of bodies in the pits before they were covered over with earth. (pp. 333f.; DEJ , p. 318f.). Because the shootings often caused stressful misgivings for the shooters, Hilberg tells us the Germans instituted the use of gas vans as 39 PS-3710."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"38 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY another instrument of murder starting in December 1941, when each Ein- satzgruppe was allotted two or three of them. Jews were killed in the gas vans with exhaust gas fed inside (pp. 349f.; DEJ , na). Here are the victim counts Hilberg gives for several cities: ñ 33,000 victims in Kiev; ñ 10,600 victims in Riga (this Einsatzkommando numbered only 21 men!); ñ 23,600 victims in Kamenets-Podolsk; ñ 15,000 victims in Dnepropetrovsk (p. 311; DEJ , p. 298); ñ 15,000 victims in Rovno (p. 312; DEJ , p. 298); ñ 10,000 victims in Simferopol (p. 391; DEJ , p. 373). Hilberg charges large-scale massacres of Jews not only to the Ger- mans, but also to the Rumanians, who he claims slaughtered 19,000 Jews in a single day, 23rd October 1941 (p. 321; DEJ , p. 306). Although the second killing sweep allegedly got under way a full three months before the first had ended, Hilberg says that there was an ì intermediary stage î, that of ghettoization. Its purposes were twofold. Referring to a (supposed) report of Einsatzgruppe C , he writes: ìAll Einsatzgruppen commanders, with the possible exception of the relentless Dr. Stahlecker, [the leader of Einsatzgruppe A] realized that the Jews could not be killed in a single sweep. In one report there is even a note of despair over the Jewish refugees who were drifting back into the cities from which they had fled. [...] Whenever the Einsatzgruppe had left a town, it returned to find more Jews than had already been killed there. 2 î (p. 358; DEJ , p. 342) The essence of the ghettos, Hilberg believes, was to: ìprevent the dispersal of the victims and to facilitate their future sei- zure for shootings.î (p. 366; DEJ , p. 349) The second purpose motivating ghettoization was the economic utili- zation of Jews: ìWhereas the mobile killing units were interested only in concentrat- ing the Jews to facilitate the second sweep, the military and civilian admin- istrations decided to exploit the situation while it lasted. Hence economic measures, in the form of labor utilization and property confiscations, became an important aspect of the intermediary stage.î (p. 372; DEJ , p. 355) ìThe army needed Jewish workers in its repair shops and Jewish clerks in its offices. 60 The armament plants under ëtrusteeshipí continued to be dependent upon Jewish labor. 61 In the Volhynian sector of the Generalko- mmissariat Volhynia-Podolia, the labor force in armament plants was 90 percent Jewish throughout 1941 and 1942. 62 î (p. 376; DEJ , p. 359)"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"39 V. T HE M ASSACRES ON THE E ASTERN F RONT Although the ghettoization policy as an ì intermediary stage î occurred between the first killing sweepócompleted by December 1941ó and the second sweep beginning in September 1941, ìWhen the civil administration took over part of the occupied terri- tory in July and August of 1941, the mobile killing units had already com- pleted a large part of the ghettoization process. Einsatzgruppe A prided itself that, upon transfer of jurisdiction, it had already made preparations for the incarceration in ghettos of all Jewish communities (excepting only Vilna). 9 î (p. 361; DEJ , pp. 344f.) The ghettos of Riga and Minsk were also designated for the reception of deported German Jews. But since the available space did not suffice for both the local Jews and the German Jews together, in Riga between the 29th November and the 9th December 1941 the National Socialists shot 27,800 Jews in two sweeps (after they had already butchered 10,600 there earlier). ì Space had now been created for transports from Germany inside the ghetto itself .î (p. 370; DEJ , p. 353). Yet the German Jews in the Riga quarter and in the nearby work camps were reduced to a handful of survivors in the months and years following their deportation at the end of 1941, due to the depredations of unchecked epidemics (p. 371; DEJ , p. 353). This caused the Germans much harm economically, because: ìIn the Riga region, where the German Jews were to be ëquartered only for a transitory stay ( nur vor ̧bergehend hier untergebracht )í, and where many of the deportees were ëcripples, war invalids, and people over seventy years of age ( Kr ̧ppel, Kriegsinvaliden und ̧ber 70 Jahre alte Leute )í 65 , a widespread demand for Jewish laborers became manifest all the same. On one occasion a Gebietskommissar employee complained that sol- diers, shouting in the presence of more than 1,000 Jews, had simply seized the labor in defiance of regulations. 66 By 1943 the remaining thousands of German and Latvian Jewish laborers were divided among a large number of employers: SS, army, navy, air force, railroads and firms. 67 î (p. 377; DEJ , pp. 359f.) From the transports reaching Minsk from Germany and the Protector- ate of Bohemia and Moravia, 5,000 Jews were shot on the 25th and 29th November (p. 371; DEJ , p. 353). Around the middle of 1943, Heinrich Himmler decided to liquidate the entire ghetto system; the ghettos would be converted into concentration camps. This conversion was completed smoothly in Latvia, but in Lithuania it was accompanied by extensive killing operations (p. 407; DEJ , p. 388). Hilberg reports: ìBy August and September 1943, the Vilna ghetto was dissolved. Most of its inmates were sent to Estonia and Latvia, where they were sub- jected to attrition and shootings, and from where the remainder was subse-"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"40 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY quently routed to the Stutthof concentration camp. Other thousands were transported to the Lublin death camp, and still others were rounded up and shot.î (p. 405; DEJ , p. 385) Jews in the Minsk ghetto were removed to Poland (p. 407; DEJ , p. 388). All told, according to Hilberg, 1.35 million Jews perished in the Soviet territories taken by the Germans. Of these, more than two thirds were murdered by the Einsatzgruppen ; the rest were killed by troops of the Higher SS and Police Leaders, of the Wehrmacht and the Rumanians, fell in partisan warfare or died due to privations in the camps and ghettos and in the open fields and woods (pp. 409f.; DEJ , p. 390). A further 1.5 million Soviet Jews escaped German rule through flight (p. 305; DEJ , p. 291). Since, of the five million Jews living in the USSR before 22nd June 1941, four million were inhabitants of zones which at times came under German control, under these conditions over one million Jews must have survived in the area ruled by the Germans (pp. 304f.; DEJ , p. 291). Now, this is Hilbergís description of what happened to the Jews in the Soviet territories overrun by the Germans. Before we take a look at the sources on which the exalted ëHolocaustí historian founds his assertions, let us pursue the question whether the picture he draws appears believable or not, using good common sense. 3. On the Likelihood of Hilbergís Description Anyone endowed with the power of logical thought who analyzes Hilbergís description of German Jewish policy in the occupied Soviet terri- tories as summarized above will inescapably come to the conclusion that it cannot hold up, and consequently it must rest on unreliable sources. Let us list some of the more gross absurdities which spring into view: a. The Claimed Numbers of Victims of the Einsatzgruppen The claimed numbers of victims of the Einsatzgruppen are impossi- bly large. The largest of the four, Einsatzgruppe A , had 990 members. If we subtract from this the 172 vehicle drivers, 3 women employees, 51 inter- preters, 3 teletypewriter operators and 8 radio operators, there are about 750 combatants left to use for the mass killings (p. 303; DEJ , p. 289). Up to 15th October 1941, Einsatzgruppe A supposedly killed 125,000 Jews (p. 309; DEJ , p. 289). Considering the fact that the mass murders first began in August (p. 307; DEJ , na), the overwhelming majority of the 125,000 vic- tims, let us say 120,000, must have been killed in a period of ten weeks."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"41 V. T HE M ASSACRES ON THE E ASTERN F RONT Since the Jews certainly cannot have gone to their deaths willingly, they must have been tracked down and driven together in the cities, where there certainly would have been escape attempts and resistance. Also there would have been the difficulty of moving the condemnees to the outskirts of the city, where most of the pits undoubtedly would have had to have been newly dug. Besides carrying out the massacres, the Einsatzgruppen were required to comb the POW camps for commissars, fanatical Communists and Jews. This would have been an immense task, because, up to the end of 1941, no less than 3,350,000 Red Army members had fallen into German hands (p. 351; DEJ , p. 334). Even when one considers that only a part of them had been captured by the middle of October, that the Einsatzgruppen did not have to do all the work, only ì the major part î of it, and that there were four Einsatzgruppen , under these conditions, during the ten weeks from the beginning of August until the middle of October Einsatzgruppe A must have searched through hundreds of thousands of POWs for the persons to be liquidatedóin addition to shooting 120,000 Jews and fighting parti- sans! One example is sufficient. In view of Hilbergís strong tendency to exaggerate, we will not go into the astronomical number of victims Hilberg attributes to the other Einsatzgruppen . b. The Refugees Drifting back into the Cities It is pure flim-flam to say that ì the Jewish refugees [...] were drifting back into the cities from which they had fled î, which meant that whenever the Einsatzgruppe had left a town, it returned to find more Jews than had already been killed there (p. 358; DEJ , p. 342). If it is really true that signif- icant numbers of Jews returned to the cities captured by the Germans, is this not an infallible indication that the Germans did not massacre the Jews, since word of such a thing would have spread like wildfire. Killing opera- tions of this magnitude are not easy to hide, especially when they suppos- edly took place near a city, as in the case of Babi Yar. c. The Purpose and the Course of the Ghettoization What Hilberg has written on the subject of ghettoization, its time frame and purpose, defies all logic. We recapitulate: ñ The ghettoization occurred between the first killing sweep (termi- nating at the end of December 1941) and the second (beginning in September 1941), which means it must have been carried out in the last four months of 1941."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"42 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY ñ In July and August, the Einsatzgruppen had already ì completed a large part î of the ghettoization process. ñ The purpose of the ghettoization was partly to facilitate the later seizure of the Jews to shoot them, since ì the Jews could not be killed in a single sweep î. ñ The ghettos also allowed Jewish labor forces to be exploited. This is all a hopeless confusion. Either in the East the Germans car- ried on an extermination policy with respect to the Jewsódictated by ideo- logical fanaticismó or they pursued a policy of ghettoizationódriven by security considerations as well as economic considerations. The two simply cannot be combined. That ghettoization would not exclude the killing of certain categories of Jews (commissars, partisans, hostages and so on) nor would it exclude spontaneous massacres ordered by local commanders, is another question. Hilbergís argument which he uses to explain the ghettoization, that so many Jews drifted back into the cities captured by the Germans that they could not be killed in a single sweep, is pure nonsense. Why not, when in the first of two massacres in Riga 10,600 Jews could be murdered by 21 men? Furthermore, if the ghettoization took place sometime between the fall and the end of 1941, the Einsatzgruppen can hardly have already ì com- pleted a large part î of it as early as July and August! We move on. In summer 1943, Himmler ordered the conversion of the ghettos to concentration camps (why exactly, when their purpose in the first place had been to facilitate shooting the Jews?). In Latvia this hap- pened smoothly, but in Lithuania it required use of force. Were the Lithua- nian Jews shot then? Partially yes, Hilberg believes, but not right where they were found, but ratherÖ in Latvia and Estonia ! Why not in Lithuania itself? The survivors from Latvia and Estonia were sent to SobibÛr in East Poland, a place Hilberg says was an ëextermination campí used only for gassing Jews, so that the purpose of sending them there can only have been to kill them. Why these Lithuanian Jews would not have been killed in Latvia and Estonia, instead of once more having valuable transport space and food thrown away on them, remains a mystery. And how did some of these Lithuanian Jews sent to Latvia and Estonia end up in the camp at Stutthof , lying east of Danzig, which Hilberg says was not a extermination camp? 40 Let us move on to the German and Czech Jews, who were removed to Riga und Minsk at the end of 1941. If, as Hilberg says, the Hitler order for the physical annihilation of Jewry had been given long before, the purpose of these measures can only"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"43 V. T HE M ASSACRES ON THE E ASTERN F RONT have been the killing of the deportees. (We repeat here the question raised before, why the Germans would not have just killed them on the spot, or at least have waited another month until the opening of the first ëextermination campí at Che ≥ mno.) In fact, says Hilberg, 5,000 of the Jews from the Reich and the Protectorate who reached Minsk were killed immediately on arrival. The rest of them were later sent backward to Poland , although whether to be killed or to work there, Hilberg does not say. In Riga, many of the unfor- tunate people died, too, but not by shooting, but because of raging epidem- ics. This meant a significant economic loss to the Germans, since the survivors performed valuable work for the ì SS, army, navy, air force, rail- way service and manufacturing concerns î. Wouldnít the Germans had done better, if they had not murdered the 27,800 Latvian Jews who were alleg- edly shot to make room for the German Jews, not to mention the 10,600 already killed by the 21 men? ì It was dark and the moon shone brightly as a speeding motor car slowly turned around the straight corner. Within were seated standing peo- ple, silently sunk in conversation ...î This is the beginning of a well-known German non-sense nursery rhyme. Hilbergís rendition of German policy on the Jews in the conquered Soviet territories sounds exactly like it. 4. No Valid Evidence for the Claimed Approximately 1.2 Million Murdered Jews Behind the Eastern Front In the beginning of 1943 the Germans found a mass grave containing 4,000 victims at Katyn in White Russia. They soon discovered that the vic- tims had been some of the Polish officers and soldiers who had been taken prisoner by the Soviets in 1939. A quickly convened international expert commission confirmed this evaluation. The National Socialists used this grisly discovery for an immense and very successful anti-Bolshevist propa- ganda campaign. In Nuremberg, the Soviets succeeded in putting the guilt on the Germans, but no one in Poland or the West really believed them. It was not until Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 that Moscow confessed that these Polish fighters had been shot by Stalinís thugsóalong with more than 10,000 others buried in other locations. 41 40 Even today in Poland, it is asserted that there were gassings of persons in Stutthof; the visitor is shown a disinfestation chamber opposite the crematory as the crime site. Yet Western historians have mostly kept away from this subject. Hilberg never mentions gassings of persons in Stutthof, which shows that he does not regard that camp as an ëextermination campí; cf. on this J ̧rgen Graf, Carlo Mattogno, Concentration Camp Stutthof , Theses & Dissertations Press, Capshaw, AL, 2001. 41 On the Katyn massacre see, for example, Allen Paul, Katyn, The Untold Story of Stalinís Polish Massacre , Charles Scribnerís Sons, New York 2 1991."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"44 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY Raul Hilbergís version is that, of the original 4 million Jews in the German occupied territories of the USSR, approximately 1.35 millions died, and only a small number of them in ghettos, camps or in the partisan war; most of them were murdered. If we take ì most of them î to mean an even 1.2 million, this means that the Germans in the USSR killed almost three hundred times as many Jews as the Soviets had killed Polish fighters at Katyn. Undoubtedly, the Communists would not have let slip this unique opportunity to repay their adversary the shame of Katyn with interest and compounded interest! Undoubtedly, as the Germans had done previously, the Soviets would have flown in international expert commissions such as the International Committee of the Red Cross. Undoubtedly, at the Nurem- berg trials they would have shown films of the exhumation of hundreds of thousands of murdered Jews! Nothing of the sort happened. Raul Hilberg explains why: ìIn June 1942, Himmler ordered the commander of Sonderkom- mando 4a, Standartenf ̧hrer Paul Blobel, ëto erase the traces of Ein- satzgruppen executions in the Eastí. Blobel formed a special Kommando with the code designation 1005 . The Kommando had the task of digging up graves and burning bodies. Blobel traveled all over the occupied territories, looking for graves and conferring with Security Police officials. Once he took a visitor from the RSHA [Reichssicherheitshauptamt] (Hartl) for a ride and, like a guide showing historical places to a tourist, pointed to the mass graves near Kiev, where his own men had killed 34,000 Jews. 93 From the beginning, however, Blobel had to contend with problems. [...] When the Russians overran the occupied territories, Blobel had fulfilled only part of his task. 96 î (pp. 408f.; DEJ , p. 389) As his source for these statements, Hilberg gives not a document from the period itself, but instead Blobelís affidavit made for one of the Nuremberg successor trials. 42 If Blobel could accomplish ì only part î of his task, then the Soviets must have found numerous unopened mass graves. The reason they did not fully exploit this discovery is unclear. Let us assume that ì only part î means that Blobel was able to open and incinerate the corpses in half the graves, i.e., 600,000 corpses. As fuel, we are told, he chose not wood, which would have been easy to come by in those heavily wooded areas, but gasoline! If one were to pour gasoline on a corpse lying in the open and set it on fire, most of the gasoline would seep into the ground. To prevent this one would have to lay the cadaver in a con- tainerósuch as a metal tub; in this case, one would need about 16 gallons 42 NO-3947."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"45 V. T HE M ASSACRES ON THE E ASTERN F RONT per incineration. 43 The gasoline loss would also be less if one lay the corpse on a pile of wood. Under the unrealistic assumption that Blobel and his people were in possession of the equipment necessary to at least partially prevent the costly gasoline from seeping away, for the incineration of 600,000 corpses they would have needed (600,000 ◊ 16 =) 9,600,000 gallons of gasolineóand this at a time when the scarcity of fuel for airplanes, armored vehicles and trucks was causing the Germans severe difficulties! With open air incineration using gasoline, bones remain behind, and usually not only splinters, but large pieces of shoulder and pelvic bones. Teeth cannot be destroyed this way at all. Also, a corpse leaves behind ashes, amounting to about 5% of body weight. 44 If, for example, Blobel and his men had wanted to dispose without a trace of the 27,800 Jews Hilberg says were murdered in Riga at the end of 1941, they would have had to do the following: ñ They would have had to remove (27,800 ◊ 30 =) 834,000 teeth (we assume that each Jew was missing two teeth, on average). ñ They would have had to remove millions of bones. ñ They would have had to scatter (27,800 ◊ 2.5 =) 69,500 kilograms of ashes (we assume that each murdered person weighed 50 kg on average, since there would have been many children among them). With a total of 600,000 corpses to dispose of without a trace, the numbers above increase by a factor of more than twenty. How Blobel and his Kommando accomplished this remains a mystery, especially since the murder sites lay in numerous, widely-dispersed localities. Hilberg never touches on fundamental questions of this kind; he apparently does not even recognize that they pose a problem. As a ì paper historian ,î 45 who avoided any on-site research and forensic investigations, he lives far from the physical reality of things in his world of records and books. Along with the mass shootings, the Germans are supposed to have killed people in mobile gas vans. As has already been mentioned in our Introduction, Hilberg does not show asingle picture of these gas vans. Even the well-known volume Nationalsozialistische Massentˆtungen durch Gift- 43 Arnulf Neumaier, ì The Treblinka Holocaust î; in: Ernst Gauss (ed.), op. cit.

This is our final result: Hilberg makes no attempt to provide material evidence for the murder of some 1.2 million Jews behind the eastern front. 5. Hilbergís Documentary Evidence The sources Hilberg cites as proof for murder of the Jews behind the eastern front fall into two broad categories: documents and witness state- ments (the latter includes also confessions of perpetrators, since the perpe- trator is by definition a witness). We turn first to the documentary evidence. Most of it concerns the so- called ì Operational Reports î ( Ereignismeldungen ) of the Einsatzgruppen , which fall into the time frame June 1941 through May 1942. These are sup- posedly daily reports of the Einsatzgruppe commanders to Heinrich Him- mler. Numerous massacres are described in these reports, sometimes with five digit numbers of victims. The Soviets supposedly found these docu- ments in the offices of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt in Berlin. The fact that the Germans would let such incriminating material fall into the hands of their enemies must arouse some surprise. If Germans could bring about the incineration without a trace of several millions of corpses in the ëextermination campsí and behind the eastern front, they would certainly have been able to incinerate a few stacks of paper! Thus, a suspicion of forgery is justified here, right from the start. There are also more technical grounds to dispute the genuineness of the documents, which the American researcher Prof. Arthur R. Butz summarizes as follows: 47 ìBesides telling of regular anti-partisan activities, the reports tell of individual actions of mass executions of Jews, with numbers of victims usu- ally running in the thousands. It is indicated, in most cases, that many cop- ies, sometimes as many as a hundred, were distributed. [Apparently the Germans were intent on letting the rest of the world know as soon as possi- ble about the butchery behind the eastern front!] They are mimeographed and signatures are most rare and, when they occur, appear on non-incrimi- nating pages. Document NO-3159, for example, has a signature, R.R. Strauch, but only on a covering page giving the locations of various units of the Einsatzgruppen. There is also NO-1128, allegedly from Himmler to Hit- 46 Eugen Kogon, Hermann Langbein, Adalbert R ̧ckerl (eds.), op. cit. (note 5). The gas vans are discussed on pages 89 through 146. 47 Arthur Butz, The Hoax of the Twentieth Century , Institute for Historical Review, Newport Beach, Calif. 1976, p. 198."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"47 V. T HE M ASSACRES ON THE E ASTERN F RONT ler reporting, among other things, the execution of 363,211 Russian Jews in August-November 1942. This claim occurs on page 4 of NO-1128, while ini- tials said to be Himmlerís occur on the irrelevant page 1. Moreover, Him- mlerís initials were easy to forge: three vertical lines with a horizontal line drawn through them.î The case of Babi Yar provides an irrefutable proof of the falseness of these Operational Reports. There, on 29th September 1941, shortly after entry into Kiev, as revenge for the operations of the resistance movement which had taken the lives of many members of the Wehrmacht and civilians, the Germans are supposed to have shot 33,000 Jews. The massacre was reported in Operational Report Nr. 106 of 7th October 1941, 48 in which the number of killed was given with German precision: There were exactly 33,711. The total number of Jews present in Kiev at the time was given by this report as 300,000. Many more Jews were killed in Babi Yar in the following weeks and months, according to ëHolocaustí writers. Researchers such as Udo Walendy 49 and Herbert Tiedemann 50 have compiled a long list of inconsistencies which undermine the reality of this supposed mass murder; here are a few of the more important: ñ The claimed total numbers of victims diverge wildly and some- times reach up to 300,000. ñ In 1931, approximately 850,000 persons lived in Kiev, of which 140,000 were Jews. 51 After the German invasion of 22nd June 1941, a massive evacuation of the civilian population took place, so that when the Germans arrived, only a little more than 300,000 Jewish and non-Jewish inhabitants remained. 52 ñ In view of the potential danger to the Jews in a German occupa- tion, the Jewish share of the evacuation must certainly not have been less than average, so that in September 1941 the German army could hardly have encountered more than 45,000 Jews.

The definitive proof that the massacre at Babi Yar never took place is given by the German air-reconnaissance photographs of the area, which the specialist John Ball has studied. 53 In September 1943, shortly before the Red Army retook Kiev, the Germans supposedly exhumed and incinerated the bodies, finishing on the 29th September. An air-reconnaissance photo- graph of 26th September shows that the ravine of Babi Yar was free of any human activity at that time. No groups of people, no vehicles, no piles of firewood, no fire and no smoke are evident. Neither the topography nor the vegetationó except for the natural growth of the treesóhad changed as compared to 1941. That unmasks the mass shooting at Babi Yar as a propaganda lie, and the fact that it surfaces in an Operational Report means that any reports of the Einsatzgruppen must be considered suspect in advance and subject to a careful expert analysis. No other claimed German massacre behind the eastern front was exploited to the extent of that at Babi Yar. The main ëproofí for this massa- cre is one of the Operational Reports. How credible, then, are other mass murders, likewise ëprovení by Operational Reports? Of course it is possibleóeven likelyóthat genuine reports of the Einsatzgruppen fell into the hands of the Soviets. If it did happen, the real reports could have served as examples for forgeries in which either the numbers of victims of real massacres was enlarged or massacres which never happened were invented. 53 John C.

The only documentary proof he cites for their existence is the letter supposedly written by SS-Untersturmf ̧hrer Becker to SS-Obersturmf ̧hrer Walter Rauff on 16th May 1942. 54 Ingrid Weckert has pointed out that this document is probably a forg- ery. 55 On the basis of a comprehensive study of all the evidence in existence pertaining to this subject, Pierre Marais has demonstrated that goods trucks mentioned therein could not have served as ì gas vans î. For one thing, the original specifications of the manufacturer of these goods trucks show that the cargo space was only 1.50 m high (4ft 11in). 56 The technical ineptness of the gas van story comes from the fact that these murder vehicles were supposed to have been Saurer 5 tonners (p. 349; DEJ , na). All Saurer vehicles were powered with Diesel engines, but the exhaust gases of Diesel engines are poorly suited to killing due to their high oxygen and very low CO content. The same Saurer firm which manufac- tured those vans who are most likely mislabeled as ì gas vans ,î also pro- duced massive numbers of goods vehicles fueled by generator gas. This gas was generated by burning moist wood and coke with a restricted amount of oxygen. Since this fule replaces gasoline, it was used by the hundreds of thousands in Germany during the Second World War. Generator gas has a CO content of up to 35%, which is quickly fatal. Thus, in contrary to Diesel exhaust gases, these gas generators themselves would have been ideal mur- der instruments. But there is no report on their use for mass killing. 57 6.

Other accusations which the Soviet prose- cutors made against Germany at Nuremberg have been long forgotten and apparently sprang from more twisted minds than the soap fairy tale. For example, the Soviets accused the National Socialists of having murdered 840,000 Russian POWs in concentration camp Sachsenhausen by means of pedal-driven skull smashing machines. 60 The Western Allies did not lag behind the Soviets in their clumsy hor- ror propaganda. Thus at the Nuremberg trial US prosecutor Robert Jackson denounced the Germans to former German armaments minister Albert Speer for having blown up 20,000 Jews with an atom bomb at Auschwitz. 61 The number of dead at Dachau was for years posted on a signboard on the grounds of the former concentration camp as 238,000, while the actual number was approximately 30,000, of which it is now undisputed that at least half died in the last four months of the war when the transport system had collapsed and epidemics spread unchecked. 62 Also at Nuremberg the Anglo-Americans paid obeisance to the lies about gas chamber murders in Dachau, Buchenwald and other western camps. For example, British chief prosecutor Sir Hartley Shawcross asserted there that the Germans had ì conducted [murder] like some mass production industry in the gas chambers and the ovens of Auschwitz, Dachau, Treblinka, Buchenwald, Mauthausen, Maidanek, and Oranien- burg .î. 63 These things so embarass present-day ëHolocaustí historians that they prefer not to denounce them as terrible lies, in most cases they do not even dare to mention them. An interesting collection of nonsense accusations thrown around at the Nuremberg trial has been assembled by Carlos Porter and Vincent Reyn- ouard. 64 All these invented German atrocities were confirmed by ëeye-witness reportsí and ëperpetrator confessionsí whose value is difficult to assess. The same applies to the numerous witness statements about massacres behind the eastern front, a substantial proportion of which were furnished for the Nuremberg trial or its successor trials. One example is the aforementioned affidavit of Paul Blobel on his activities hehind the eastern front.

At the same time, according to another affidavit, that of an RSHA man named Hartl, ì like a guide showing historical places to a tourist, [Blobel] pointed to the mass graves near Kiev, where his own men had killed 34,000 Jews î. 65 Since this massacre near Kiev (Babi Yar) cannot have taken place, the affi- davit is necessarily fraudulent. The victorious powers did not lack the means to compel such witness testimony. In 1948 a US delegation led by judges Gordon Simpson and Edward van Roden determined that the Americans had regularly resorted to torture to procure confessions. 66 In other cases the accused were persuaded to incriminate themselves or their fellow accused by promises of acquittal or light punishment. Wilhelm Hˆttl is a notable example. 67 If the ëdemo- craticí Americans resorted to such methods, it is hardly likely that the Sovi- ets were any more honorable in their methods. This is the nature of the ëeye-witness reportsí and ëperpetrator con- fessionsí that Raul Hilberg adduces as evidence for the genocide against the Soviet Jews. What follows is a quotation from one such witness statement, which we give as a drastic demonstration of what the world-famous ëHolo- caustí Giant foists upon his readers. The passage in question is given on pages 347 and 348 ( DEJ , pages 332 and 333); Hilbergís source is an article that appeared in the German language US Jewish newspaper Aufbau (New York) on 23rd August 1946, which was based on a statement attributed to SS-Obergruppenf ̧hrer Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski. Hilberg does not tell the reader when and where the confession was supposedly made. ìOnce, in mid-August 1941, Himmler himself visited Minsk. He asked Einsatzgruppe B Commander [Arthur] Nebe to shoot a batch of a hun- dred people, so that he could see what one of these ëliquidationsí really looked like. Nebe obliged. All except two of the victims were men. Himmler spotted in the group a youth of about twenty who had blue eyes and blond hair. Just before the firing was to begin, Himmler walked up to the doomed man and put a few questions to him. Are you a Jew? Ye s . Are both of your parents Jews? Ye s .

During every volley he looked to the ground. When the two women could not die, Himmler yelled to the police sergeant not to torture them. When the shooting was over, Himmler and a fellow spectator engaged in conversation. The other witness was Obergruppenf ̧hrer von dem Bach-Zelewski, the same man who was later delivered to a hospital. Von dem Bach addressed Himmler: Reichsf ̧hrer, those were only a hundred. What do you mean by that? Look at the eyes of the men in this Kommando, how deeply shaken they are! These men are finished for the rest of their lives. What kind of followers are we training here? Either neurotics or savages! Himmler was visibly moved and decided to make a speech to all who were assembled there. He pointed out that the Einsatzgruppe were called upon to fulfill a repulsive (widerliche) duty. He would not like it if Germans did such a thing gladly. But their conscience was in no way impaired, for they were soldiers who had to carry out every order unconditionally. He alone had responsibility before God and Hitler for everything that was hap- pening. [...] After the speech Himmler, Nebe, von dem Bach, and the chief of Him- mlerís Personal Staff, [Karl] Wolff, inspected an insane asylum. Himmler ordered Nebe to end the suffering of these people as soon as possible. At the same time, Himmler asked Nebe ëto turn over in his mindí various other kill- ing methods more humane than shooting. Nebe asked for permission to try out dynamite on the mentally ill people. Von dem Bach and Wolff protested that the sick people were not guinea pigs, but Himmler decided in favor of the attempt. Much later, Nebe confided to von dem Bach that the dynamite had been tried on the inmates with woeful results. 179 î Who would have ever thought it?

Hilbergís Invented ëShooting of Baltic Camp Inmatesí Concerning the deportation of Jews from the Baltic states to Reich German camps, Hilberg writes that the Baltic camps had been broken up a few months after May 1944: ìFrom August 1944 to January 1945, several thousand Jews were transported to concentration camps in the Reich. Many thousands of Baltic camp inmates were shot on the spot, just before the arrival of the Red Army. 90 î (p. 408; DEJ , p. 388)"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"53 V.

Naturally, as ëproofí of the shooting of Baltic-Jewish camp inmates, Hilberg offers no document, only a witness statement; that of a certain Jew Joseph Tenenbaum. 8. What Really Happened to the Jews in the Occupied Soviet Territories? In view of the catastrophic lack of documentation, under the present circumstances it is an impossible task to give the number of Soviet Jews killed by the Germans even approximately. The question is incomparably more difficult than, for example, the question of the alleged gassings of per- sons in Auschwitz. The latter supposedly took place in clearly identified structures described in construction drawings and partially still in existence today, whose suitability for the purpose of mass gassing of persons can be technically evaluated. However, with respect to theóreal and claimedó mass shootings behind the eastern front in places mostly unknown, it will not be possible to make an examination of the crime scene after a half cen- tury. Only archaelogical excavations could help us at this point, if only one knew where in the vastness of Russia one should dig. We believe that the successor states to the USSR are in possession of German documents which would clarify this aspect of the events behind the eastern front, but that the documents in question are not being made avail- able for political reasons. The question of Jewish population losses in the East cannot be settled until they can be examined. It is also possible that previously unknown air-reconnaissance photographs will be discovered that could shed light on the reality or lack of reality of massacres such as claimed for Babi Yar. Despite the mass shootings of Soviet Jews that did occur behind the eastern front, everything points to the conclusion that the Germans pursued a general policy of a physical concentration of Jews, and that from early on. One indication of this is a report of the commander of the 350th Infantry Regiment on 19th August 1941, containing this statement: 71 70 Krzysztof Dunin-W ± sowicz, ì Ø ydowscy Wi Íº niowie KL Stutthof î, in: Biu ≥ etyn Ø ydowskiego Instytutu Historycznego , Warsaw 1967, Nr. 63, p. 10."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"55 V.

The handy trick of accusing the author of the report of using of ì code language î will not work here, because in that case he would not have written of elimination of ì sus- picious elements î (which unquestionably means ëkillí). To distinguish between such suspicious elements and the rest of the Jews would have been useless in that case. The ghettoization policy that Hilberg describes extensively confirms this hypothesis. It responded to both security considerations (Jews concen- trated in ghettos can be policed more easily) and economic necessity: Hil- berg himself has emphasized how important the Jews housed in the Riga ghetto were to the Germans as for their manufacturing skills. The deportation of German and Czech Jews to Minsk and Riga was nothing other than an improvised and chaotic attempt to set in motion the ì final solution of the Jewish question î by removal to the East. This policy could not be pursued later because of military reverses to the Germans after 1943. The transports of Lithuanian and White Russian Jews to Latvia, Esto- nia and Poland only make sense if the Jews were taken to where there was housing and employment for them. Otherwise the transports would have had no logical purpose. That the population losses of the Jews were far less than those that Hilberg postulates follows from a comparison of Jewish population figures for several Soviet cities before and after the German occupation. In his book The Final Solution , which was considered the standard work prior to Hil- berg, the British-Jewish historian Gerald Reitlinger gives a few numbers for 1946: 72 Kiev: 100,000 Jews Dnepropetrovsk: 50,000 Jews Odessa: 80,000 Jews Vinnitsa: 14,000 Jews Reitlingerís source for these numbers is an article in the Yiddish lan- guage Soviet journal Ainikeit , the date of whose publication he does not give.

If the return ì had just begun î in 1946, as stated in the Soviet-Jewish journal cited by Reitlinger, a far greater proportion of the Jews of these cities had sur- vived than would be indicated by Hilbergís statistic (40% dead). We also point out that Hilbergís figure of 40% evacuated or fled is too low under the circumstances. In his detailed study The Dissolution of the Eastern Euro- pean Jewry , based almost entirely on Jewish and Allied data, Walter N. San- ning arrives at a figure of up to 80%, although it is true that some of his sources are dubious. For example, he quotes David Bergelson, the secretary of the Jewish Anti-fascist Committee, who stated in Moscow in 1942: 73 ì The evacuation saved a decisive majority of Jews of the Ukraine, White Russia, Lithuania, and Latvia. According to information from Vitebsk, Riga and other large centers which were conquered by the Fascists, there were few Jews there when the Germans arrived.î It is quite possible that Bergelson exaggerated the numbers of evacu- ated persons to put the services of the Soviets in saving the Jews in the best light. 74 The actual percentage of Jews who fled or were evacuated is proba- bly more than Hilbergís 40% and less than Sanningís 80%. Together with the observation that the return movement had just begun in 1946, the pre- war and post-war Jewish population figures for the above four cities contra- dict the assertion that Soviet Jews in the German occupied territories lost almost two fifths of their population through mass murder, ghettoization and concentration camps. The actual percentage was certainly far lower. 73 Gregor Aronson, Soviet Russia and The Jews , New York 1949, p. 18; cited by Walter N. Sanning, op. cit.

The Initial Situation Beginning in 1942, Jews from the German Reich and from states occupied or allied with it were sent in massive numbers to concentration camps and ghettos in Polish territory and lesser numbers were sent to con- centration camps in the Reich and camps and ghettos in the occupied Soviet territories. The numbers of those displaced is known very accurately for most of the states in question, thanks to the German deportation lists which have been preserved. From Serge Klarsfeldís research, for example, we know that barely 76,000 Jews were deported from France, 75 which corre- sponds to a fifth of the Jews living in France, most of them holding foreign passports. 76 For Belgium, the Netherlands and other west European states and for the German Reich, the numbers are also largely undisputed. For Hungary, the number of Jewish deportees is generally recognized to be 438,000, and is only questioned by a single reputable scholar, the American Professor Arthur Butz. 77 However, the deportations from Poland, the demo- graphic core area of European Jewry, are very incompletely documented 75 In his study Le MÈmorial de la DÈportation des Juifs de France (Beate and Serge Klarsfeld, Paris 1978) Klarsfeld states that the number of deported French Jews was 75,721. The margin of error cannot be more than 1-2%. 76 Thus most Jews who were French nationals were not affected. How does this coincide with the claimed policy of systematic extermination of the Jews? 77 In the chapter ì Hungarian Jews î of his book The Hoax of the Twentieth Century , op. cit. (note 47), Butz defends the theory that the Veesenmayer Dispatches, which have been used to prove that the number of deportees from Hungary was 438,000, are forgeries, and that the number of Jews deported from Hungary was in reality no more than 100,000. One piece of evidence he cites supporting this argument, among others, is a report of the ICRC on its activities in Hungary dating from 1948, in which there is no mention of mass deportations in the Spring and early Summer of 1944. Although we do not consider Butzí theory to be definitively disproven, we assume the generally recognized numbers of deportions are correct, since these are supported not only by the Veesenmayer Dispatches, but also by documents from neutral states dating from during the war. For a further discussion on the 1944 deportations of Hungarian Jews, see J ̧rgen Graf, ì What Happened to the Jews Who Were Deported to Auschwitz but Were Not Registered There? î, The Journal of Historical Review , 19(4) (2000), p. 4-18, and Arthur Butz, ì On the 1944 Deportations of Hungarian Jews î, The Journal of Historical Review , 19(4) (2000), p. 19-28."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"58 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY and the numbers given in the official historical writing are very question- able. Consequently, in the no less than 515 pages ( DEJ , 470 pages) that Hilberg devotes to the deportations in the second volume of his work, he moves on largely firm documentary ground with respect to the dates and destinations of the deportations as well as the number of those displaced, with the exception of the key country Poland. He turns first to the situation in that part of Europe where the National Socialists were able to carry out their Jewish policy at their discretion, namely, the Reich itself, the Protec- torate of Bohemia and Moravia and the Generalgouvernement and then to those countries where they had to pay more or less respect to domestic gov- ernments or at least administrations; Hungary is an example of the first, the Netherlands of the second. These 515 pages demonstrate clearly Hilbergís strategy of puffing up his work with quantities of useless details. He inundates his reader with an endless flood of information that has no bearing on the subject named in the title of his work, the ì destruction of the European Jews î. He tells us the Minister of Mines in the Croatian Pavelic regime was named Frkovic, that the Minister of Commerce in the Slovakian Tiso regime was Stano, that the Minister of Public Health in the Romanian Antonescu regime was Tomescu and other useless items. He spends no less than seven pages (pp. 428-435; DEJ , pp. 410-416) belabor- ing the ì administrative juggernaut î of the Reich railways in detail and bores his reader to tears with a pedantic enumeration of the state secretaries for the Reich railways in the Ministry of Commerce. In order to reach the desired number of pages he mixes in painstak- ingly collected anecdotes like the following: ìOn October 3, 1942, the Propaganda Division in Radom reported a disturbing incident that had resulted from the dispatch of a postcard. The Germans published a paper in Poland, the Krakauer Zeitung , for the local German population. The chief of the Radom branch of the paper had received from LwÛw a postcard that began (in German): ëI donít know Ger- man. You can translate everything from Polish into German.í The card then continued in Polish: You old whore and you old son of a whore Richard (In the German trans- lation: Alte Hurenmetze und du alter Hurenbock Richard ). A child has been born to you. May your child suffer throughout his life, as we Jews have suffered because of you. I wish you that from the bottom of my heart. This anonymous note actually disturbed its recipient and worried the propaganda experts. The Propaganda Division feared that it was the begin- ning of a flood of postcards, and the card was transmitted to the Security Police for tracing.î (p. 548; DEJ , p. 522)"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"59 VI. T HE D EPORTATIONS Obviously, passages like this make Hilbergís work thicker, but not better! 2. The Purpose of the Deportations: Labor Deployment versus Extermination As the war continued, the labor shortage in the German Reich and in the countries under its sway took more and more dramatic forms. An immense quantity of documents testify as to how desperately the National Socialists constantly sought to recruit new workers for their industriesó especially their war industries. The deployment of Jewish labor forces played a critical role here. In addition to the Jewish workers living in rela- tive freedomóinhabitants of the £ Ûd º ghetto, for example, who manufac- tured steel helmets for the Wehrmachtóhundreds of thousands of Jews were sent to concentration camps and labor camps as forced labor or were forced to work in the armaments industry. Since, as Hilberg says, the Germans pursued a policy of systematic extermination of the Jews, for him the deportations can logically have had only one purpose, to transport the deportees to this very extermination. Now there is considerable documentary evidence for shockingly high death rates in camps and ghettos caused by typhus and other epidemics and also by lack of nutrition, but none for a German goal of extermination and, in particular, none for the presence of ëextermination campsí in which Jews were mur- dered with gas. On the other hand, many documents demonstrate the deployment of Jews in the war economy. Here are a few examples: On 25th January 1942, five days after the Wannsee Conference, Heinrich Himmler wrote to the General Inspector of Concentration Camps, Richard Gl ̧cks: 78 ìArrange for the induction of 100,000 male Jews and up to 50,000 female Jews into the concentration camps. The concentration camps will be asked to perform great economic tasks in the next few weeks.

The mobilization of all prisoner labor forces, first for war purposes (armaments industries) and later for peacetime purposes now moves to the foreground. Necessary measures follow from this realization which require the gradual conversion of the concentration camps from their earlier one-sided political form to an organization conform- ing to the economic requirements.î On 21st August 1942, a month after Hilberg and other ëHolocaustí giants tell us Treblinka was put in operation as a fifth ëextermination campí, Martin Luther, Chief of the German Section of the Foreign Office, wrote in a memorandum: 81 ìThe fundamental principle of German Jewish policy after taking power consisted in furthering Jewish emigration by all possible means. The present war gives Germany the opportunity and the duty to resolve the Jew- ish question in Europe. [...] Based on the above-mentioned F ̧hrer instruc- tion [a Hitler decision taken in August 1940 to remove all Jews from Europe] the evacuation of Jews out of Germany was begun. It was advisable as soon as possible to get hold of the Jewish nationals of countries who had likewise taken measures with respect to the Jews. [...] The number of Jews removed to the East in this way did not suffice to meet the requirements for labor forces there.î This sets down point blank that the removal of Jews to the East was for the purpose of utilization of their labor power. The extremely high death rates in the camps, caused mostly by epi- demics, but also by poor nourishment and poor clothing, naturally detracted heavily from their economic usefulness. For this reason, on 28th December 1942 Gl ̧cks sent a general notice to all concentration camp commanders in which he held them personally responsible for the conservation of their pris- oner labor forces. He wrote: 82 ìThe senior camp medical doctors will use all the means at their dis- posal to insure that mortality rates in the several camps decrease substan- tially. [...] The camp medical doctors should supervise the nutrition of the prisoners more closely than before and submit proposals for improvements in conformance with the administrative measures of the camp commanders. 81 NG-2586. 82 NO-1523."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"61 VI. T HE D EPORTATIONS These should not only be put on paper, but should be regularly monitored by the camp medical doctors. [...] The Reichsf ̧hrer SS has ordered that mortal- ity absolutely must be reduced.î Himmler issued this order for the reduction of mortality at a time when, according to Hilberg and the other ëHolocaustí historians, six ëexter- mination campsí were running full blast, since gassing had supposedly begun two months before in Majdanek, the sixth ëdeath factoryí. It could hardly be more clearly shown how the annihilation theory however framed has no connection with the facts backed by documentation. In fact, the conditions in the camps improved markedly as a result of this directive and the mortality sank by almost 80% within eight months. 83 On 26th October 1943, at a time when Hilberg tells us 4.3 million Jews had already been exterminated and the extermination of 800,000 more was yet to come (p. 1300; DEJ , na), Oswald Pohl sent a general notice to the commanders of 19 concentration camps, in which he stated: 84 ìIn the framework of German armaments production, thanks to the improvement efforts that have been undertaken in the past 2 years, the con- centration camps have become of decisive importance in the war. From nothing we have built armaments works that are second to none. We now have to redouble our efforts to make sure that the production levels so far achieved are not only maintained, but further improved. That will be possible, as long as the works and factories remain intact, only by maintaining and even improving the labor capacity of the prisoners. In earlier years, given the reeducational policy of the time, it did not matter much whether or not a prisoner could perform useful work. Now, however, the labor capacity of the prisoners is important, and all measures of the commanders, director of the liaison service and medical doctors should be extended to maintaining the health and efficiency of the prisoners. Not from phony sympathy, but because we need them with their arms and their legs, because they must contribute to a great victory for the German people, we must take the well-being of the prisoners to heart. I want this to be the primary goal: no more than 10% of all prisoners should be unable to work due to sickness. All responsible persons should work together to achieve this goal. This will require: 1) proper and fitting nourishment, 2) proper and fitting clothing, 3) utilization of all natural health measures 4) avoidance of all effort not necessary for the performance of work, 5) performance bonuses.î 83 PS-1469. 84 Archiwum Muzeum Stutthof I-1b-8, p. 53."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"62 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY Just eight days later, on 3rd November 1943, Hilberg tells us, the Germans shot over 40,000 Jewish workers in Majdanek and two of its out- lying camps (p. 559; DEJ , p. 532 states they shot ì as many as 17,000 work- ers in a single operation î)! For 1944 also, we are in possession of a large number of documents which show the deployment ofómostly Jewishóprisoners in the arma- ments industry; on 11th May, for example, Adolf Hitler personally ordered the deployment of 200,000 Jews in the framework of the fighter construc- tion program. 85 A few days later, Hilberg and his consorts again tell us, the first death trains with Hungarian Jews were on their way to Birkenau. Fur- ther comment would be superfluous. Because of the large number of documents concerning the economic aspects of the deportations, it was not possible for Hilberg to simply skip the subject. He devotes 20 pages (pp. 550-570; DEJ , pp. 523-542) to the subject in connection with the deportation of Polish Jews and also provides several concrete examples of the utilization of Jewish labor. On p. 551 ( DEJ , pp. 524f.), for example, he writes: ìIn Upper Silesia tens of thousands of Jews had been drawn from ghettos into camps by the Organisation Schmelt, an agency in charge of labor impressment in the Silesian region. 139 Thousands were employed in the construction of war plants. They were indispensable enough to cause Obergruppenf ̧hrer Schmauser, the Higher SS and Police Leader of Upper Silesia, to write to Himmler in April 1942 that replacements for 6,500 Jews in major construction projects (Grossbauten) would hardly be available. 140 Several months later, when Krupp was planning to build a plant for the pro- duction of naval artillery at Markst‰dt, near Breslau, the firm discovered that the Organisation Todt (Speerís construction agency) was employing many Jews in projects nearby. With the ëcomplete approvalí of Vizeadmiral Fanger, Krupp suggested that these Jews stay on to erect the naval fac- tory. 141 In 1944 the Silesian Krupp plant was still employing thousands of these Jews. 142 î On p. 564 ( DEJ , p. 537) Hilberg provides a list of ì more important enterprises with Jewish labor forces î; there are 17 firms on the list. ( DEJ lists 16 firms) The absurdity of the idea that the Germans urgently in need of labor- ers had wantonly annihilated an immense number of exactly these laborers is uncommonly embarrassing for the defenders of the extermination theory. They regularly resort to the argument that only Jews unfit for work were gassed and that those fit for work were left alive.

T HE D EPORTATIONS tradicts the assertion of these same historians that the Germans indiscrimi- nately gassed all Jews irrespective of age or health in four to six extermination camps 86 and thereby destroyed many hundreds of thousands of potentially valuable laborers. If there had been an annihilation policy, there must have been some logic to it, but there is no recognizable logic to the policy that Hilberg and his consorts ascribe to the NS regime. In order to alleviate these screaming contradictions somewhat, Hil- berg invents internecine warfare within the NS leadership between the advocates of annihilation and its opponents. For example, on p. 552 ( DEJ , p. 525) he asserts: ìThe year 1942 was a time when the civil administration, the Ost- bahn, private firms under contract to the military commander or the Arma- ment Inspectorate, as well as the SS itself, were all making use of Jewish labor in various business ventures. Foremost among the offices [sic] attempting to check the flow of irreplaceable Jewish workers into the killing centers were the military commander, General Gienanth, and the armament inspector, Generalleutnant Schindler.î No source is given, because the attempt to curb the disappearance of irreplacable Jewish workers into the killing centers attributed to generals von Gienanth and Schindler is Hilbergís own invention . To prove that such an attempt had been madeónaturally, without bothering about documen- tary suppportóHilberg would first of all have had to produce evidence for the existence of the killing centers, and this he has still not done in 552 pages. 3. Hilbergís Invented Mass Shootings in Galicia On p. 521 ( DEJ , p. 496) the exalted high priest of the ëHolocaustí informs his readers as follows: ìIn Stanis ≥ awow [a town in Galicia] , about 10,000 Jews had been gathered at a cemetery and shot on October 12, 1941. Another shooting took place in March 1942, followed by a ghetto fire lasting for three weeks. A transport was sent to Be ≥ø ec in April, and more shooting operations were launched in the summer, in the course of which Jewish council members and Order Service men were hanged from lampposts. Large transports moved out to Be ≥ø ec in September and October [...] î Let us leave to one side the transports to Be ≥ø ec, the shooting in March 1942 and the Jews ì hanged from lampposts î, and content ourselves 86 In Treblinka, Be ≥ø ec, SobibÛr and Che ≥ mno supposedly only a handful of ì worker Jews î ( Arbeitsjuden ) needed for the operation of the killing areas were excepted from immediate death."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"64 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY with the first item of ëinformationí here, the shooting of not less than 10,000 Jews in the cemetery in Stanislavov on 12th October 1941. This number corresponds to the population of a small town. What evidence does Hilberg support himself with, what sources does he name as proof for the ten thou- sandfold murder in the cemetery? Simply and utterly none, not even a wit- ness statement. In other words: The story is a pure chimera. For the mass shooting of over 40,000 Jewish armaments workers that supposedly took place on 3rd November 1943 in Majdanek and its outlying camps Travniki and Poniatova, Hilberg at least gives us sources in the form of witness statements (p. 563; DEJ , p. 537). Italian researcher Carlo Mat- togno was the first to investigate rigorously this supposed massacreówhich has inexplicably entered the ëHolocaustí literature with the name ì harvest festival î ( Erntefest )óon a scientific basis and prove conclusively that it should be relegated to the realm of legend. 87 4. As Sheep to the Slaughter ... If it is true that millions of Jews were killed in killing factories set up for that purpose, it would not have been possible to keep this a secret. Hil- berg himself acknowledges this glaring fact. Concerning the ëextermination campsí Che ≥ mno, Treblinka and Be ≥ø ec, for example, he writes: ìPoland [...] was the home of all six killing centers and Polish trans- ports were moving in short hauls of not more than 200 miles in all direc- tions. Many eyes were fixed on those transports and followed them to their destinations. The deputy chief of the Polish Home Army [(a] London- directed underground force), General Tadeusz BÛr-Komorowski, reports that in the spring of 1942 he had complete information about the Kulmhof (Che ≥ mno) killing center in the Warthegau. [...] In July 1942 the Home Army collected reports from railroad workers that several hundred thousand Jews had disappeared in Treblinka without a trace. 39 [ 88 ] Sometimes the information spilling out of the camps was quite spe- cific. In the Lublin district the council chairman of the Zamo ∂Ê ghetto, Miec- zys ≥ aw Garfinkiel, was a recipient of such news. During the early spring of 1942 he heard that the Jews of Lublin were being transported in crowded 87 J ̧rgen Graf and Carlo Mattogno, KL Majdanek.

Treblinka was opened in July 1942, as he notes on p. 956; the exact date was the 23rd July. ( Enzyklop‰die des Holocaust , op. cit. (note 36), v. III, p. 1430). This means that, according to Hilbergís ërailway workersí, in this tiny camp within at most 8 days (23rd-31st July) hundreds of thousands of Jews ëdisappeared without a traceí!"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"65 VI. T HE D EPORTATIONS trains to Be ≥ø ec and that the empty cars were being returned after each trip for more victims. He was asked to obtain some additional facts and, after contacting the nearby Jewish communities of TomaszÛw and Be ≥ø ec, was given to understand that 10,000 to 12,000 Jews were arriving daily in a strongly guarded compound located on a special railroad spur and sur- rounded by barbed wire. The Jews were being killed there in a ëpuzzling mannerí. Garfinkiel, an attorney, did not give credence to these reports. After a few more days, two or three Jewish strangers who had escaped from Be ≥ø ec told him about gassings in barracks. Still he did not believe what he heard. On April 11, 1942, however, there was a major roundup in Zamo ∂Ê itself. Counting the remaining population of his ghetto, Garfinkiel calcu- lated a deficit of 3,150 persons. The next day, the thirteen-year-old son of one of the council functionaries (Wolsztayn) came back from the camp. They boy had seen the naked people and had heard an SS man make a speech to them. Hiding, still clothed, in a ditch, the young Wolsztayn had crawled out under the barbed wire with the secret of Be ≥ø ec. 40 î (pp. 517f.; DEJ , pp. 492f.) Like a wildfire the news of the mass gassings must have spread over all Poland in these circumstances, and from there out into the bordering countries! How did the Jews now threatened with annihilation react to this Jobís news? Raul Hilberg does not hide it from us: ìThroughout Poland the great bulk of the Jews presented themselves voluntarily at the collection points and boarded the trains for transport to killing centers. Like blood gushing out of an open wound, the exodus from the ghettos quickly drained the Polish Jewish community of its centuries-old life.î (p. 520; DEJ , p. 495) No, it is not complimentary, the testimony that Hilberg gives here about his ëraceí or his fellow Jews! The descriptions of Jewish attempts at flight or resistance that follow this passage in no way blot out the mon- strousness of the assertion that the great bulk of Jews voluntarily allowed themselves to be sent to the killing centers. Again in August 1944, when almost the whole of Polish Jewry had been exterminatedóas we are told by our ëHolocaustí popeóthe Jews of the ghetto of £ Ûd º boarded the trains to Auschwitz willingly and without resistance, because: ìIn fact, £ Ûd º had become the largest ghetto by default, [ 89 ] its 80,000 people struggling with a prison diet and a twelve-hour day for two more years. Then, in August 1944, announcements were posted in the ghetto under the heading ëVerlagerung des Ghettos (transshipment of the ghetto).í 89 The German-language edition states here that the growth was due to delays in deportation. But how can delays in deportation be explained when the ëextermination campí Che ≥ mno lay close by?"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"66 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY The Jews were ordered to present themselves for Verlagerung on penalty of death. 11 6 This time the Jews knew where [German chief of the ghetto adminis- tration office] Biebow wanted to send them, and something like a sitdown strike ensued in workshops I and II. These Jews had held out for so long that now, with the end of the war in sight, they were not willing to go to their deaths voluntarily. The Germans decided to proceed with propaganda war- fare. [...] Biebow [...] began to speak. [...] Biebow had always tried to do his best. He still wanted to do his bestónamely, ëto save your lives by moving this ghettoí. Right now, Ger- many was fighting with her last ounce of strength. Thousands of German workers were going to the front. These workers would have to be replaced. Siemens and Schuckert urgently needed workers, Union needed workers, the Cz Í stochowa munitions plants needed workers. [...] The trip, said Biebow, was going to take ten to sixteen hours. Food had already been loaded on the trains. Everybody could take along 40 pounds of luggage. Everyone was to hold on to his pots, pans, and utensils, because in Germany such things were given only to bombed-out people. So, common sense. If not, and then force were used, Biebow could not help anymore. 117 The Jewish workers of workshop areas I and II changed their minds. They surrendered. By the end of August the ghetto was empty except for a small cleanup Kommando. 118 The victims were shipped not to Germany, to work in plants, but to the killing center in Auschwitz, to be gassed to death. 11 9 î (p. 543; DEJ , pp. 517f.) Were they dumb as straw or pathetically cowardly, the Jews of £ Ûd º ? They were the former if they believed the promises of their (alleged) execu- tioners. They were the latter if they foresaw their destiny and nevertheless made no attempt to flee, or, if there were no chance for flight, at least to try to take as many of their executioners to death with them as they could. Like sheep they marched to the slaughter, we are told! The Hungarian Jews did exactly the same thing, also in 1944. Thus Hilberg: ìin Hungary the Jews had survived until the middle of 1944. They were killed in Hitlerís final year of power, in an Axis world that was already going down to defeat. [...] The Hungarian Jews were almost the only ones who had full warning and full knowledge of what was to come while their community was still unharmed. Finally, the Hungarian mass deportations are remarkable also because they could not be concealed from the outside; they were carried out openly in full view of the whole world.î (pp. 859f.; DEJ , p. 797) On this subject Hilberg quotes Dr. Rudolf Kastner, former co-presi- dent of the Hungarian Zionist Association, as follows:"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"67 VI.

We knew more than it was necessary about Auschwitz ...

On this meeting, Hilberg reports: ìDuring the meeting Eichmann performed one of the greatest shows of his career. In the words of the historian Levai, ëhe virtually hypnotized the Jewish Council and through that body, the whole of Hungarian Jewryí Eichmann began his speech by giving the assembled Jews the bad news. First, he said, the Jewish labor battalions would have to be increased. [ 90 ] However, he assured his listeners that the Jewish workers would be treated well and that they might even be permitted to return home at night. Second, a Judenrat would have to be formed with jurisdiction over all Jews in Hungary. The Judenrat would have to act as a channel for Ger- man orders, as a central financing and taxation agency, and as a central depository of information concerning Hungarian Jews. Third, the Judenrat would have to publish a newspaper that would contain all the German orders. [...] So much, said Eichmann, for the German requests. [...] The Jews were relieved. Now they knew what they had to do. Falling all over each other, they began to draw up plans for their Judenrat. [...] At the same time, the council addressed a manifesto to the Jewish population to maintain discipline and obey orders: On receiving orders from the Central Council it is the duty of every per- son to report at the place and time indicated. î (pp. 889f.; DEJ , pp. 824f.) Let us recapitulate: The Hungarian Jews had ì full knowledge of what was to come î; they had seen how the Jewish population groups had been ì disappearing one after the other from the map of Europe î; since 1942, they had ì a complete picture of what had been happening in the East with the Jews deported to Auschwitz and other extermination camps îóand what did the Jewish leaders do?

Between June 29 and October 28, 1944, Stutthof received over 50,000 Jews, who were sent from the Baltic area (Kaunas and Riga) and also from Auschwitz. 91 Some of the deportation lists can be inspected at the archive of the Stutthof memorial. 92 Of the Jews who came from Auschwitz, 11,464 were from £ Ûd º and 10,602 were from Hungary. 93 Also a consider- able number of the Jews transported to Stutthof from Riga and Kaunas were Hungarian. 92 It is clear that they had been sent to the Baltic area first when they were deported from Hungaryópossibly through the railway junction at Auschwitzóto be employed there on munitions projects, before the approach of the Red Army forced the Germans to retreat from the Baltic states and to evacuate the camps there. At that time Stutthof performed the function of a major distribution center for labor forces; theómostly femaleóJewish prisoners were appor- tioned among the various outlying camps, transferred to camps further south or employed as agricultural labor. 94 We have found that the transferees from Auschwitz to Stutthof con- stituted only a small proportion of the Hungarian Jews deported from £ Ûd º and Hungary. The disposition of the others is mostly still unclear; as the archives in the East are opened to research, the subject may be progres- sively better understood. On the other hand, every Jew that left Auschwitz alive is a powerful argument against the theory that the latter served as an annihilation center for European Jewry. The transfers also square with the countless documents that deal with the deployment of Jews as labor. This 91 On this see J ̧rgen Graf and Carlo Mattogno, op. cit.

The reason for the deportation of people from £ Ûd º and Hungarian Jews was apparently that which the German chief of the ghetto administra- tion office gave to the Jews of £ Ûd º and which Adolf Eichmann gave in his meeting with the Hungarian-Jewish community leaders. The Jews were to be drafted as workers. Those that could not be employed at Auschwitz and its outlying camps were transferred to Stutthofóor to other camps or arma- ments works. The Jews were aware of this. Had they known or even suspected that they faced cold-blooded murder they would not have boarded the trains to Auschwitz. Of course, they were not the miserable weaklings that Hilberg so disparagingly portrays. Foreseeing certain death, they would definitely have taken any chance at escape or taken to arms in despair.

The Killing Centers 1. The Initial Situation From p. 927 ( DEJ , p. 861) forward we confront the main theme of the ëHolocaustí, namely the supposed mass killing of Jews in killing centers specially constructed for that purpose, which Hilberg characterizes as fol- lows: ìThe most striking fact about the killing center operations is that, unlike the earlier phases of the destruction process, they were unprece- dented. Never before in history had people been killed on an assembly-line basis.î (p. 927; DEJ , p. 863) In this chapter the central problem that has caused Hilberg so much trouble from the beginning of his second volume, namely, the complete lack of documentary evidence for the presence of such centers, assumes gigantic proportions. Every ì assembly-line î in the world can be drawn, blueprinted, and photographedóexcept, it seems, Hilbergís. No documentary paperwork has survived from the four ëpure exter- mination campsí, Che ≥ mno, Be ≥ø ec, SobibÛr and Treblinka. The orthodox historians explain that this is because the Germans destroyed it in time. This certainly cannot be excludedóbut then, why did the Germans carelessly leave behind stacks of records in Auschwitz and Majdanek? The court his- torians of the Allies never consider a second possibility, namely, that the Soviets and the Polish Communists captured German records in the four other ëextermination campsí as well as in Auschwitz and Majdanek, but got rid of them or let them disappear into secret archives because they too bla- tantly contradicted the desired view of these camps. For Be ≥ø ec, Hilberg mentions journals of Fritz Reuter, the deputy director of the Population and Welfare Subdivision of the Interior Division in the Office of the Gouverneur of Lublin. According to these journals, Hans Hˆfle, an assistant of Odilo Globocnik, 95 stated that a camp for Jews was to be built in Be ≥ø ec, on the Eastern border of the Generalgouverne- ment; the Jews would cross the border and would never return to the Gener- algouvernement (pp. 940f.; DEJ , p. 878). SobibÛr and Treblinka, like Be ≥ø ec, lay in the extreme east of the Generalgouvernement. Remembering"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"72 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY that German documents repeatedly speak of ì resettlement of the Jews to the east î and that the occurrence of these resettlements is not denied even by the orthodox historians, 96 it is obvious that these camps might have been transit camps in which Jews were to be temporarily held pending transfer further east. Of course, Hilberg does not find such a hypothesis worthy of consideration. Since no wartime German documents have survived from these three campsóor from Che ≥ mno (Kulmhof), lying west of £ Ûd º óand there are no material remains except for some barracks foundations in Che ≥ mno, Hilberg is free to babble as much as he wants, supported by a few witness reports and also Adalbert R ̧ckerlís frequently referenced book Nationalsozialis- tische Vernichtungslager im Spiegel deutscher Strafprozesse , 97 which itself is almost exclusively based on witness testimony given in Federal German trials. Hilberg is less free to do so in the case of Auschwitz and Majdanek. For one thing, the structures identified as killing gas chambers have partly survived, so one can examine them with respect to their suitability for the use ascribed to them. For another thing, in this case we are in possession of a large number of wartime records, and these do not contain any indication of a policy of annihilation or of killing gas chambers, but do contain much evidence for the economic significance of these camps. In the subchapter ì Labor Utilization î (pp. 982-1000; DEJ , pp. 917- 935) Hilberg explores this topic in detail. On p. 985 ( DEJ , p. 921) he sum- marizes ì SS Industry in the Killing Centers î in a table, and on pp. 987-994 ( DEJ , pp. 922-931) he discusses the activities of I.G. Farben in Auschwitz. Here are some excerpts: ìSignificantly, the I.G.ís involvement in Auschwitz can be traced not to a desire to kill Jews or to work them to death but to a complicated manu- facturing problem: the expansion of synthetic rubber (Buna) production [in view of the lack of natural rubber required for tire manufacture and impor- tant for the war...] The Ludwigshafen plant did not suffice to bring production to the required level, and the planners consequently considered two alternatives: expansion of the H ̧ls plant from 40,000 tons to 60,000 tons or construction 95 SS-Brigadef ̧hrer Odilo Globocnik was a confidant of Himmlerís and from June 1941 the person in charge of the construction of SS and police support points in the ënew Eastern regioní.

[...] The investment in Auschwitz was initially over RM 500,000,000, ulti- mately over RM 700,000,000. 29 [...] About 170 contractors were put to work. 31 The plant was set up, roads were built, barracks were constructed for the inmates, barbed wire was strung for ëfactory pacificationí (Fabrik- einfriedung) , 32 and, after the town of Auschwitz was flooded with I.G. per- sonnel, two company villages were built. 33 To make sure that I.G. Auschwitz would have all the necessary building materials, Krauch patronizingly ordered that Buna enjoy first priority (Dringlichkeitsstufe I) until comple- tion. 34 Spreading out, I.G. Auschwitz acquired its coal base, the F ̧rsten- grube and the Janinagrube. Both mines were filled with Jewish inmates. 35 î (pp. 991ff.; DEJ , pp. 924f., 928f.) Thus, the town of Auschwitz, bordering the concentration camp, ì was flooded with I.G. personnel î, ì 170 contractors were put to work .î Does this mean that the National Socialists did everything they could to see to it that news of the industrialized killing in Auschwitz would spread over all Europe in no time? But the world was silent. The Vatican was silent, the International Red Cross was silent and even the Allied governments, who routinely accused the Germans of all kinds of atrocities, never mentioned Auschwitz. Remarkable, is it not? Although Hilberg generously concedes that the participation of I.G. Farben in Auschwitz ì can be traced not to a desire to kill Jews î, he claims ì the SS mentality had taken hold even of I.G. Farben directors î: ìOne day, two Buna inmates, Dr. Raymond van den Straaten and Dr. Fritz Lˆhner-Beda, were going about their work when a party of visiting I.G. Farben dignitaries passed by. One of the directors pointed to Dr. Lˆh- ner-Beda and said to his SS companion: ëThis Jewish swine could work a lit- 98 ì Technischer Ausschufl î (Technical Committee)."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"74 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY tle faster ( Diese Judensau kˆnnte auch rascher arbeiten ).í Another director then chanced the remark: ëIf they canít work, let them perish in the gas chamber ( Wenn die nicht mehr arbeiten kˆnne, sollen sie in der Gaskammer verrecken )í.î (p. 994; DEJ , p. 930) This episode, in which an unnamed I.G. director threatens Jews who work too slowly with the gas chamber, is ëprovení by an affidavit made by former Auschwitz inmate van den Straaten on 18th July 1947 for one of the Nuremberg successor trials. This example is characteristic: The existence of ì the gas chamber î 99 and the involvement of German industry in annihila- tion of the Jews is ëprovení by witness testimony given in an Allied trial. For the prosecutors and judges of defeated Germany, it was childís play to obtain such testimony. There was certainly no lack of former Jewish con- centration camp prisoners who burned for revenge on their former oppres- sors, and there was no lack of typewriters and stationery on which to write down their ëaffidavitsí. This is the way in which most of Hilbergís evidence for the ëHolocaustí came into existence. 2. Hilbergís Imaginary Number of Victims of the ëextermination campsí On p. 956 ( DEJ , pp. 893, 894) Hilberg provides an overview of ì The ëFinal Solutioní in the Death Camps î; he gives the following death counts: in Che ≥ mno: 100 150,000 Jews in Be ≥ø ec: 550,000 Jews in SobibÛr: 200,000 Jews in Treblinka: 750,000 Jews in Majdanek: 101 50,000 Jews in Auschwitz: 1,000,000 Jews T OTAL : 2,700,000 Jews Non-Jewish victims of these six camps Hilberg deems worthy only of a footnote (on p. 955; DEJ , p. 894) in which he assertsówithout a sourceó that in Auschwitz more than 250,000 non-Jews, mostly Poles, perished; in Che ≥ mno, Treblinka and Auschwitz he says tens of thousands of Gypsies were gassed, of course, without any evidence to support it.

In other words, the numbers are humbug snatched out of thin air which Hilberg has copied down from vari- ous other unnamed authors and partially ëcorrectedí after his own personal taste. 103 Robert Faurisson has rated Hilbergís work to be superior with respect to the amount of labor input, but with respect to its quality he calls it ì atro- cious î ( exÈcrable ). 104 In view of the shameless sleight-of-hand of the pope of the ëHolocaustí, who can pull 2.7 million Jews murdered in six camps out of his sleeve without an iota of evidence, we have to concur with Fauris- sonís opinion. The fact that the work of other ëHolocaustí scribblers, such as Lucy Dawidowicz, who comes up with a total of more than 5 million Jews exterminated in the same six camps, 105 is of even worse quality is no excuse for Hilberg. For Be ≥ø ec, SobibÛr, Treblinka and Che ≥ mno, without sources or material traces no rationally founded count of victims can be given. Even for Auschwitz, in 1985 Hilberg could not provide documentary evidence for his figure as he brought the ì definitive î edition of his work to press, since at that time the death registers had not yet been made available from the Soviet archives. (Study of these death registers and of other documents which have become available in the meantime shows that the number of Jews and non- Jews who died in Auschwitz should be placed at somewhere between 160,000 and 170,000. 106 ) For Majdanek, Hilberg could have found material with which to calculate an approximate number of victims (of Jews and non-Jews) had he taken the trouble to study the documents lying in the archive of the memorial at Majdanek. 107 102 Danuta Czech, ì Kalendarium der Ereignisse im Konzentrationslager Auschwitz-Birkenau î, in: Hefte von Auschwitz , v. 2-4, 6-8 (1959-1964).

Killing Weapons and Removal of Corpses in the ëextermination campsí, as Told by Hilberg a. The ëPure Extermination Campsí Be ≥ø ec, SobibÛr and Treblinka were apparently built by the Office of Buildings and Grounds of the SS-WVHA (which opened as Section C in March 1942). 108 Hilberg tells us, the sites ì were chosen with a view to seclu- sion and access to railroad lines î. An inspection of the locations of the former camps reveals that in the case of SobibÛr and Che ≥ mno, not dis- cussed here, one might talk of ì seclusion î; Be ≥ø ec and Treblinka were situ- ated only about a kilometer from towns of the same names, so that there would have been no possibility of keeping mass murder secret there. With respect to the gas chambers, Hilberg writes: ìInformation about the number and size of gas chambers in each camp rests not on documentation but on recollection of witnesses. There is agreement that the new chambers were larger than the old (the capacity for simultaneous gassings in Be ≥ø ec during the summer of 1942 was estimated at 1,500). Counts of gas chambers are given in the following ranges: Be ≥ø ec 3, then 6 SobibÛr 3, then 4, 5, or 6 Treblinka 3, then 6 or 10.î (footnote on p. 942; DEJ , p. 879) In Che ≥ mno, Hilberg says, Jews were killed in gas vans (p. 934; DEJ , p. 871). We have already said what has to be said about these mythical vehi- cles in connection with the events behind the eastern front, and there is no reason to add anything further. On the gases used and removal of corpses, Hilberg states as follows: ìThe gas first used at Be ≥ø ec was bottled, either the same prepara- tion of carbon monoxide that had been shipped to the euthanasia stations or possibly hydrogen cyanide. 39 î (p. 941; DEJ , p. 878) In a footnote on the same page, he elaborates: ìBottled gas (Flaschengas) is mentioned by Oberhauser (Obersturm- f ̧hrer at Be ≥ø ec). See text of his statement in R ̧ckerl, NS-Vernichtungslager , pp. 136-137. The court judgement in the Oberhauser case identifies the gas as cyanide (Zyklon B), Ibid. , p. 133.î Hilberg continues: 107 Approximately 42,500 people died in Majdanek. Cf. J ̧rgen Graf and Carlo Mattogno, op. cit. (note 87), pp. 71-79. The percentage of Jews among the dead cannot be determined exactly, but it must have been over 50%. If one subtracts from Hilbergís claimed 50,000 Jewish victims of this camp the 17,000 or 18,000 invented shooting victims of 3rd November 1943, the resulting number is not much greater than the actual one. 108 Wirtschaftsverwaltungshauptamt (Main Office of Economic Administration)."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"77 VII.

A German who briefly served at SobibÛr recalls a 200-horsepower, eight-cylinder engine of a captured Soviet tank, which released a mixture of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide into the gas chambers.î (p. 941; DEJ , p. 878) Here is how he says the corpses were removed: ìIn 1942 corpses were buried in mass graves in Kulmhof, the Gener- algouvernement camps, and Birkenau. Before long this mode of dealing with the dead gave rise to second thoughts. [...] Ministerialrat Dr. Linden, steril- ization expert in the Interior Ministry, on a visit to the Lublin district, is quoted by an SS man to have remarked that a future generation might not understand these matters. 98 The same consideration had prompted the Gestapo chief M ̧ller to order Standartenf ̧hrer Blobel, commander of Ein- satzkommando 4a, to destroy the mass graves in the eastern occupied terri- tories. 99 Blobel and his ëKommando 1005í also moved into Kulmhof to investigate what could be done with the graves there. He constructed funeral pyres and primitive ovens and even tried explosives. 100 [...] By 1942-1943 exhumations were in progress at all of the killing cen- ters. In Kulmhof Jewish work parties opened the mass graves and dragged the corpses into newly dug pits and into a primitive oven. 105 In Be ≥ø ec the process was begun in the late fall of 1942 within a firing area of the camp capable of destroying 2,000 bodies per day. A second, somewhat smaller fir- ing position was started a month later, and the two were used concurrently, day and night, until March 1943. 106 Excavators appeared in SobibÛr and Treblinka, where the corpses (moved by narrow-gauge railway in SobibÛr and dragged in Treblinka) were stacked and burned on firing grids built with old railway tracks. 107 î (p. 1045; DEJ , pp. 976f.) b. Majdanek Hilberg gives no facts for the number and location of the gas cham- bers in the camp at Lublin. The gassings of persons were supposedly done with carbon monoxide. 109 Hilberg cautiously reports the assertion found in the Polish literature that in Majdanek the murders were also done with Zyk- lon B (footnote on p. 943; DEJ , p. 880). He says nothing about the methods of removal of corpses; in view of the small number of victims here com- pared to the other ëextermination campsí, the question is of little impor- tance. 109 Polish historical writings claim the carbon monoxide was fed to the gas chambers from steel bottles.

Auschwitz-Birkenau A table on p. 946 ( DEJ , p. 884) contains Hilbergís information on the gas chambers in this camp: ñ One gas chamber in the crematory of the main camp (Auschwitz I); ñ Bunker I, a former farmhouse in Birkenau, which contained five small gas chambers; 110 ñ Bunker II, another former farmhouse in Birkenau; ñ One underground gas chamber each in Crematories II and III in Birkenau, which began operations in March and June 1943, re- spectively; ñ One above-ground gas chamber each in Crematories IV and V in Birkenau, which began operations in March and April 1943, re- spectively. The killing weapon in Auschwitz was supposedly Zyklon B; Hilberg says the choice of this gas was made personally by camp commandant Rudolf Hˆfl: ì [Hˆfl] decided after visiting Treblinka that the carbon monoxide method was not very ëefficientí. 55 Accordingly, he introduced in his camp a different type of gas: quick-working hydrogen cyanide (prussic acidócom- mercial name, Zyklon).î (p. 945; DEJ , p. 882) In Birkenau, the real ëextermination campí, the corpses of the gassing victims as well as the corpses of those who died a natural death were incin- erated in the four crematories which began operations starting March 1943 (pp. 947ff.; DEJ , p. 884). According to Hilberg, their theoretical daily capacity was over 4,000 (p. 1045; DEJ , p. 978). 111 In May and June 1944, Hilberg tells credulous reders, nearly 10,000 Jews were gassed every day, and in the second half of August even higher numbers were achieved. Since the capacity of the crematories was insufficient, the additional corpses were allegedly incinerated in pits (p. 1045f.; DEJ , p. 978). 110 Directly following the table in which Bunker I was said to have ì five small gas chambers î, Hilberg writes that ì the inner walls were removed î from the two farm houses! If the inner walls were removed, it is logical that the house could have contained only one gas chamber and not five. Naturally, this would have simplified the gassing process and enlarged the usable area. Hilberg overlooks the fact that the removal of the inner walls would probably have caused the house to collapse, because in farm houses like this one the inner walls were usually load bearing walls. 111 According to the document Hilberg refers toówhich we will discuss lateróa further 340 corpses per day could be cremated in Crematory I of the main camp."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"79 VII. T HE K ILLING C ENTERS d. The Holocaust Pope with the Healthy Stomach In any everyday murder trial an expert report is prepared on the weapon used to do the killing, be it a revolver or a knife, a hammer or an ax. In such a spectacular and inhuman crime as the claimed multiple million murders in ëextermination campsí one would expect to hear all the details about the weapon, meaning here not only the gas chambers but also the dif- ferent gases. Let us recapitulate what Hilberg has said: ñ For Treblinka and SobibÛr the witnesses cannot even agree as to the number of gas chambers. Hilberg swallows this toad without complaintóhe has got a healthy stomach. ñIn Be ≥ø ec bottled gas was used at first, which was either carbon monoxide or hydrogen cyanide; Adalbert R ̧ckerlís book on the Federal German NS trials says the latter was the case (ì The court judgement in the Oberhauser case identifies the gas as cyanide (Zyklon B) î). Also the killers changed killing weapons and turned to a diesel motor. ñ In Auschwitz Rudolf Hˆfl decided on Zyklon B, because in Tre- blinka he had noticed that the carbon monoxide method (meaning, use of a diesel motor which allegedly blew carbon monoxide into the gas chamber) was ì not very efficient î. In this case, why would one have given up Zyklon B and turned to a diesel motor in Be ≥ø ec? Hilberg swallows this toad also, without batting an eye. We continue: Zyklon B is not a ëbottled gasí; it is hydrogen cyanide adsorbed in a carrier substance (usually plaster of Paris)óoccasionally used even today with the name Cyanosil for controlling harmful insects and rodents. 112 The product came in cans. When the cans were opened, the gas began to vaporize; the higher the temperature, the quicker the vaporization. Hilbergís remarks on Zyklon B (pp. 948f.; DEJ , pp. 884) show that he knows this. In that he quotes a Federal German court decision to the effect that Zyklon B was a ëbottled gasí, he indirectly reveals that the Federal German court in question never took the trouble to determine what Zyklon B is by calling for an expert report on the murder weapon, in the course of a trial that concerned 550,000 to 600,000 murder victimsówhich speaks volumes as to the evi- dentiary value of such trials. We move on to Rudolf Hˆfl, the first commandant of Auschwitz. Hˆfl found the method of mass murder with diesel exhaust gases used in Tre- 112 On this cf. Wolfgang Lambrecht, ì Zyklon B ñ eine Erg‰nzung î, VffG , 1(1) (1997), pp. 2-5 (online: http://vho.org/VffG/1997/1/Lambrecht1.html)"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"80 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY blinka not efficient enough and decided to use Zyklon in Auschwitz. As source for this, Hilberg gives Hˆflí affidavit made on 5th April 1946. 113 Let us examine the chronology of events. On p. 946 ( DEJ , p. 884) Hilberg tells us the mass gassings began in Auschwitz I in ì early 1942 î and in Bunker 2 in Birkenau in ì spring 1942 î. Ten pages later, on p. 956 ( DEJ , p. 893), he gives July 1942 as the date on which Treblinka began operations. Thus, Hˆfl began gassing with Zyklon in early 1942 in Auschwitz I and in spring 1942 in Birkenau after he had convinced himself in July 1942, at the earliest, that the method used in Treblinka was not effective enough. Logi- cal, is it not? As to the removal of corpses in Be ≥ø ec between late Fall 1942 and March 1943, 550,000 corpses were allegedly incinerated under open sky . This method must have been unusually successful, because certainly no one has been able to find any human remains to speak of on the site of the former camp. Why was this efficient method of removal of corpses not adopted in Auschwitz, why was the firm Topf and Sons brought in to build crematories with good money? How useless the construction of the latter was, was shown in May, June and August 1944, when in Birkenau 10,000 or so corpses per day , in August even more, needed to be incinerated: The open pits dug there ì broke the bottleneck î (p. 1046; DEJ , p. 978). Since, as Hilberg tells us, the theoretical maximum capacity of the Birkenau cremato- ries was rated at a little more than 4,000 corpses per day, the remaining up to 6,000 corpses per day must have been incinerated in the pits. Why then the useless crematoriesóa couple more pits would have done as well? Hilbergís stomach is strong enough. He swallows one toad after another and never has a stomach ache. 4. Hilbergís Methodology: The Revaluation of all Values In the discipline of jurisprudence there is a generally recognized hier- archy of evidence. At the top of the hierarchy is physical evidence, the investigation of the material traces of a crime (corpse, murder weapon, bloodstains, fingerprints and so on); the next highest rank is documentary evidence and the lowest is testamentary evidence, of which a particular form of testamentary evidence, the testimony of interested partiesóthose directly affected by the event in questionóis considered particularly unreli- able. 114 113 PS-3868."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"81 VII. T HE K ILLING C ENTERS With Hilberg, the ordering is reversed: Testamentary evidence and especially the testimony of interested parties is highest in the hierarchy, fol- lowed by documentary evidence. Physical evidence he does not bother with. If a document contradicts a witnessí statement, Hilberg regularly decides for the latter, as long as it will help his annihilation theory. Every historical researcher with a reputation for worthwhile work knows that in a conflict between documents and witnesses the former must be chosen. Theóanti-RevisionistóFrench historian Jacques Baynac has remarked pointedly: 115 ìFor the scientific historian a witness statement does not represent real history. It is an object of history. A witness statement counts for little, many witnessesí statements count for no more, if there is no solid document to support them. One could say without much exaggeration, the principle of scientific historiography is, No paper(s), no proven facts.î Since Baynacís view is a generally held view in academic and judi- cial circles, these few sentences alone are enough to shatter to pieces Hil- bergís chapter on the ì Killing Center Operations î! A pregnant example of the reversal of the scientifically recognized hierarchy of forms of evidence can be seen in those passages in which Hil- berg discusses the disinfestation agent Zyklon B. This agent was employed in many campsóeven those not claimed to be extermination campsóto eradicate lice, which transmitted typhus. The sometimes terrifying high death counts in the concentration camps 116 were due primarily to this ram- paging disease. On p. 949 ( DEJ , p. 886) Hilberg writes: ìThe SS did not manufacture Zyklon, so the gas had to be procured from private firms. The enterprises that furnished it were part of the chemi- cal industry. They specialized in ëcombating of verminí (Sch‰dlingsbek‰mp- fung) by means of poison gases. Zyklon was one of eight products manufactured by these firms, 71 which undertook large-scale fumigations of buildings, barracks, and ships; disinfected [sic] clothes in specially con- structed gas chambers (Entlausungsanlagen) ; and deloused human beings, protected by gas masks. 72 In short, this industry used very powerful gases to exterminate rodents and insects in enclosed spaces.î 114 On the hierarchy of evidence see Manfred Kˆhler, ì The Value of Testimony and Confessions Concerning the Holocaust î, in: Ernst Gauss (ed.), op. cit.

Cf. the statistics in Jean-Claude Pressac, Les crÈmatoires díAuschwitz , CNRS, Paris 1993, p. 145. In Majdanek in August 1943 the death rate for men was 7.67% and for women 4.41%.

This does not hinder Hilberg from writing: ìThe amounts [of Zyklon B] required by Auschwitz were not large, but they were noticeable. Almost the whole Auschwitz supply was needed for the gassing of people; very little was used for fumigation. 85 î (pp. 952f.; DEJ , pp. 889f.) Hilbergís informant in this matter is the Rumanian Jew Charles Sigismund Bendel, a former Auschwitz prisoner to whom we will return. Interestingly, in 1989 Jean-Claude Pressac turned Hilbergís statement upside down when he wrote that 97 to 98% of the Zyklon was used for pest control, and only 2 to 3% was used to kill Jews. 119 That Hilberg gives more weight to the witnesses than to the docu- ments is in and of itself inexcusable, and the delinquency is magnified by the fact that in almost all cases it is a case of testimony of interested parties, who tend to be particularly unreliable: Most of the witnesses he quotes were former Jewish concentration camp inmates, from whom objectivity on the subject of the Germans and especially the SS could not be expected, and who were only too happy to give testimony in trials that would put those who had deprived them of their freedom on the gallows or at least in prison. But there is worse: Hilberg picks his witness statements so that they will support his predetermined dogma. By 1961, when he published his work for the first time, the currently accepted ëHolocaustí theory had already crystallized there: The mass murders were committed with gas in six extermination camps. One year before, Martin Broszat, then a researcher at the Institute for Contemporary History in Munich and later its director, had declared that there had been no gassing of humans in Dachau, Bergen- Belsen, Buchenwald and other camps in the west. 120 117 NO-9098. 118 NO-9912.

T HE K ILLING C ENTERS Hilberg holds fast to his prescribed view of the ëHolocaustí, and he does not think it worthwhile to mention the numerous unreliable witness statements describing gassings in just these camps in the west. 121 He also refuses to discuss the alleged gas chambers at Mauthausen and Stutthof, although the former are tenaciously defended in Austria and the latter in Poland to the present day. In other words, Hilberg thinks that all testimonies on these gas chambers are false, meaning that the witnesses are lying or are subject to hallucinations. Why then are the witness statements on gassings in the six ëextermination campsí a priori credible? Hilberg will not touch crucial questions like this one even fleetingly. If one were to put the witness testimony to mass murder of Jews com- ing from during and after the war under a magnifying glass, one would dis- cover that there have been descriptions of all kinds of methods of killing which later have been forgotten. In a book published in 1945 a Dr. Stefan Szende described how millions of Jews were killed by electricity in Be ≥ø ec: The victims were made to stand on a metal plate, this was lowered into an underground water cistern, then high-voltage current was fed through the water. At that point, ì the metal plate became a crematory casket, glowing hot, until all the corpses were burnt to ashes î. 122 Simon Wiesenthal also claimed that Jews had been killed by electricity in Be ≥ø ec, but he described the killing process quite differently from Szende: 123 ìCrowded together, driven on by the SS, Latvians and Ukrainians, the people ran through the open gate into the ëbathí. It could hold 500 peo- ple at a time. The floor of the ëbathing roomí was made of metal and there were showerheads in the ceiling. When the room was full, the SS switched the electricity, 5,000 volts, through the metal plate. At the same time the showerheads spurted water.

Since one footnote might mention two or more sources, some footnotes appear several times.

Hilberg names this work as a source forty-one times. 139 It illustrates better than anything else how all evidence for the ëHolocaustí rests on witness testimonyómostly given in trialsóand how Federal German justice has not bothered with physical evidence. For his part, R ̧ckerl cites the first edition of Hilbergís work copiously. One hand washes the other. 137 Numerous former Treblinka prisoners are quoted in Alexander Donatís The Death Camp Treblinka (Holocaust Library, New York 1979). 138 Latin for ëHilberg spokeí.

R UDOLF V RBA : Although the Slovakian Jew Vrba (originally Walter Rosenberg) is considered one of the main witnesses to the claimed extermination of the Jews in Auschwitz, Hilberg names him as a source only twice in the chapter on the ì Killing Center Operations î. 147 After he and his fellow countryman and Jew Alfred Wetzler succeeded in escaping from Auschwitz in April 1944, they wrote a report which was published with other such reports in November of that year as the ì War Refugee Board Report î, in which for the first time the stories of mass gassing with Zyklon B are spoken of. It can be ascertained from the report that Vrba and Wetzler never saw the crematories which contained the gas chambers because the map they drew does not in the least conform to the actual configuration of the crematories. They assert, for example, that the Leichenkeller (the alleged ëgas chamberí) of Krema II was at the same level as the oven room, but in fact it was underneath the lat- ter; also the number of ovens is wrong. 148 Vrba ëcorrectsí these errors in his 1964 ëfactual reportí I Cannot For- give , 149 which Hilberg cites; he phantasizes about a Himmler visit in Aus- chwitz in January 1943 during which the Birkenau crematory was inaugurated with the gassing of 3,000 Jews 150 (in the WRB Report he had given the number 8,000). Later, we will quote a passage from the descrip- tion of this gassing. In fact, the first crematory in Birkenau was opened in March 1943 (Hilberg, p. 946; DEJ , p. 884), and we know that Himmler vis- ited Auschwitz for the last time in July 1942. 151 During the first Z ̧ndel trial in Toronto (1985), Vrba made a terrible fool of himself as witness for the prosecution.

In Birkenau for the period between the beginning of May and the 26th July 1944 alone, she says 1,314,000 persons were exterminated. 155 As we have seen, Hilberg comes to a figure of 1.25 million victims for the whole period of existence of Aus- chwitz-Birkenau (counting both persons exterminated and natural deaths). Lengyel also resorts to the nonsense about the industrial utilization of human fat: 156 ìThe Nordic Supermen knew how to profit from everything. Immense casks were used to gather the human grease which had melted down at high temperatures. It was not surprising that the camp soap had such a peculiar odor.

Hilberg refers to this book eight times. 164 The Hungarian Jewess G. Sereny interviewed former Treblinka commandant Franz Stangl many times as he sat in a Fed- eral German prison, where, according to her book, he confirmed the mass murder in that camp. Shortly after their last conversation, Stangl died under mysterious circumstances. G. Serenyís work is completely worthless as a historical source because she does not provide any proof that Stangl actually made the statements attributed to him. She offers no tape recordings as evif- dence of the conversations, and she has not published any transcripts of her alleged interviews. Since a dead man cannot complain, Sereny can put into his mouth whatever she wants to. In addition, even if Stangl had confessed to mass gassings in Tre- blinka, this would have been no proof. He had appealed from his sentence to life in prison, and to dispute the crime laid to him would have been inter- preted as ëobdurate denialí, which would preclude a reduction in the sen- tence or a pardon from the start. On the other hand, those accused who confessed could hope for some slight mercy from Federal German justiceó as a reward for confirming the annihilation of the Jews. 165 K URT G ERSTEIN : Main witness to mass gassings in Be ≥ø ec, was used by Hilberg as a source six times. 166 SS sanitation officer Gerstein described these gassings in a confession given after the waróor, better put, in six confessions, since, as Frenchman Henri Roques has shown, there are no less than six versions 164 Hilbergís footnotes 109, 113, 122, 194f., 501, 503f.; Hilbergís DEJ footnotes 10 (p. 896), 19 (p. 898), 93 (p. 916), 7 (p. 979), 10 (p. 980). 165 On the mechanisms employed in the course of the Federal German NS trials, see Wilhelm St‰glich, Auschwitz.

He said that in Be ≥ø ec 700 to 800 Jews were stuffed into a gas chamber with a floor area of 25 m 2 , which is 28 to 32 persons per square meter. Of Auschwitz, which he never entered, he affirmed that millions of children were killed by holding cotton wads soaked with hydrogen cyanide under their noses. Hallucinations about 35 to 40 m (115 to 130 ft) high piles of clothes and shoes of murdered pris- oners top off this confession appropriately. 168 R UDOLF R EDER : Next to Gerstein, Reder is the only witness to gassings in Be ≥ø ec and author of a book published in Cracow in 1946 on his experiences in that camp. 169 Hilberg cites him as a source twice. 170 Although he was over 60 at the time he was interned and there were certainly younger Jews available, he was chosen for the labor kommando. He lived for months on end under ì merciless monsters who commit horrible cruelties with sadistic delight î and survived no less than 80 liquidation operations. One day the merciless monsters sent Reder and an SS man in a motor car on a shopping trip.

[...] The corpses were soaked in gasoline. This entailed considerable expense and the results were inadequate; the male corpses simply would not burn. Whenever an airplane was sighted overhead, all work was stopped, the corpses were covered with foliage as camouflage against aerial observa- tion. It was a terrifying sight, the most gruesome ever beheld by human eyes. When corpses of pregnant women were cremated, their bellies would burst open. The fetus would be exposed and could be seen burning inside the motherís womb. [...] The gangsters are standing near the ashes, shaking with satanic laughter. Their faces radiate a truly satanic satisfaction. They toasted the scene with brandy and with the choicest liquors, ate, caroused and had a great time warming themselves by the fire.î Wiernik, the only witness who claims to have participated in the annihilation operations directly for an extended period of time, can tell us amazing things about corpses that burn on their own: 176 ìIt turned out that bodies of women burned more easily than those of men. Accordingly, the bodies of women were used for kindling the fires.î Well, these are the major witnesses presented to a modern, intelligent world by a Giant of a Professor at the University of Vermont, and the tax payers may rightly wonder why he was retained for some thirty years to teach their impressionable children! b.

This one, a Slovakian Jew, spent three years in Auschwitz and belonged to the Sonderkommando that was assigned to crematory duty. In 1979, a full 34 years after the end of the war, with the help of ghost writer Helmut Freitag, he wrote a book titled Sonderbehandlung , 177 which Hilberg cites as a source no less than twenty times, 178 only six times less than star witness Number One, Rudolf Hˆfl.

T HE K ILLING C ENTERS On his first day at work M ̧ller is in the gas chamber in the main camp at Auschwitz I: ìA violent blow, accompanied by Stark yelling: ëGet a move on, Strip the stiffs!í galvanized me into action. Before me lay the corpse of a woman. With trembling hands and shaking all over I began to remove her stockings. [...] I longed for a moment of rest. I kept a watchful eye on Stark and waited for a chance to take a breather while he was not looking. My moment came when he went across to the cremation room. Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a half-open suit-case containing food. Pretending to be busy undressing a corpse with one hand, I ransacked the suit-case with the other. Keeping one eye on the door in case Stark returned suddenly I hastily grabbed a few triangles of cheese and a poppyseed cake. With my filthy, blood-stained fingers I broke off pieces of cake and devoured them raven- ously.î (M ̧ller, pp. 23f.; EA , p. 12) What M ̧ller describes here is a radical impossibility: He ate in a room polluted with hydrogen cyanide, which he could hardly have done with a gas mask on. Did the SS then make the crew of the Sonderkommando go into the gas chamber without gas masksó were they all somehow hydro- gen cyanide-proof? Obviously, in any hypothetical gassing of persons the victims should be made to undress beforehand; to have to take the clothes off the bodies would have complicated the procedure by adding hundreds of hours of tedious work and would have been an additional danger for the Sonderkom- mando , because hydrogen cyanide is poisonous on contact and can be absorbed by the skin. ìThe powers that be had allocated twenty minutes for the cremation of three corpses. [in one muffle] It was Starkís duty to see to it that this time was strictly adhered to.î (M ̧ller, p. 20; EA , p. 16) At the present day, the incineration of a corpse in the muffle of a modern crematory lasts nearly an hour on average. 179 That this applied as well to the crematories installed in the German concentration camps during wartime by the Topf firm, is shown by, among other things, the data for the Dutch transfer camp Westerbork, where the specified time period was strictly adhered to for every cremation. 180 If one were to cremate two corpses in one muffleówhich is not provided foróone would approxi- mately double the time needed, just as it takes approximately twice as long to burn a piece of wood weighing 2 kg in an oven than to burn a piece of 179 Verbal communication of Hans H‰feli, employee of the Basle crematorium, with the author, 10th February 1993. 180 On this, cf.

If it were even possible to fit three corpses into one muffle, the incineration period would last nearly three hours, about twelve times longer than the time given by M ̧ller. But no, ì the powers that be had allocated twenty minutes for the cremation of three corpses. It was Starkís duty to see to it that this time was strictly adhered to .î Apparently, at the command of the SS even the Laws of Thermodynamics could be suspended. M ̧llerís impression of the German medical doctors was not espe- cially favorable: ìFrom time to time SS doctors visited the crematorium, above all Hauptsturmf ̧hrer Kitt and Obersturmf ̧hrer Weber. During their visits it was just like working in a slaughterhouse. Like cattle dealers they felt the thighs and calves of men and women who were still alive and selected what they called the best pieces before the victims were executed. After their exe- cution the chosen bodies were laid on a table. The doctors proceeded to cut pieces of still warm flesh from thighs and calves and threw them into waiting receptacles. The muscles of those who had been shot were still working and contracting, making the bucket jump about.î (M ̧ller, p. 74; EA , p. 46) M ̧ller decided to kill himself and join the condemned in the gas chambers, but: ìSuddenly a few girls, naked and in the full bloom of youth, came up to me. They stood in front of me without a word, gazing at me deep in thought and shaking their heads uncomprehendingly. At last one of them plucked up courage and spoke to me: ëWe understand that you have chosen to die with us of your own free will, and we have come to tell you that we think your decision pointless: for it helps no one.í [...] Before I could make an answer to her spirited speech, the girls took hold of me and dragged me protesting to the door of the gas chamber. There they gave me a last push which made me land bang in the middle of the group of SS men.î (M ̧ller, pp. 179f.; EA , p. 113f.) Elsewhere, the Giant Professor Hilberg told his gullible readers that Jews were crowded into the gas chambers so tightly that children were thrown on top of their heads! But now, Hilberg presents eyewitness testi- mony alleging enough room for running and pushing the ëheroí. And what is worse: If the people in the chamber really knew what was about to hap- pen, how can one expect them to push M ̧ller out of an obviously open door, but not to try to escape themselves? In Summer 1944, when the Hungarian transports came to Birkenau, the Sonderkommando was kept busy: ì [...] the two pits were 40 to 50 meters long, about 8 meters wide and 2 meters deep. However, this particular place of torment was not yet ready for use by any means. Once the rough work was finished, there followed the realization of the refinements thought up by the arch-exterminatorís warped"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"97 VII. T HE K ILLING C ENTERS ingenuity. Together with his assistant, Eckardt, [Hauptscharf ̧hrer Otto Moll] climbed down into the pit and marked out a 25 centimeters by 30 cen- timeters wide strip, running lengthways down the middle from end to end. By digging a channel which sloped slightly to either side from the center point, it would be possible to catch the fat exuding from the corpses as they were burning in the pit, in two collecting pans at either end of the channel. [...] As the heap of bodies settled, no air was able to get in from outside. This meant that we stokers had constantly to pour petrol or wood alcohol on the burning corpses, in addition to human fat, large quantities of which had collected and was boiling in the two collecting pans on either side of the pit. The sizzling fat was scooped out with buckets on a long curved rod and poured all over the pit causing flames to leap up amid much crackling and hissing.î (M ̧ller, pp. 207f., 217f.; EA , pp. 130, 136) Hilberg snatches up this outlandish nonsense on p. 1046 ( DEJ , p. 978)! It is obvious that in the incineration of a corpse, the fat would be the first thing to burn; it would never run down into troughs. If it had done so, the first spark falling into it would have set it on fire. That the incinerations in the pits in Birkenau described by M ̧lleró and other witnessesócould not have occurred in the time period in question is shown by photographs from the Allied aerial reconnaissance collections, whose interpretation is due mostly to extensive work by John Ball. 181 On a photograph from May 31, 1944, there are small clouds of smoke rising behind Crematory V which could never have come from an incineration of the size described. In all other locations and in all other photographs noth- ing of the kind can be seen. 182 M ̧ller says SS-Hauptscharf ̧hrer Moll amused himself as follows: ìAnother unusual entertainment in which he would indulge every now and then was called swim-frog. The unfortunate victims were forced into one of the pools near the crematoria where they had to swim around croaking like frogs until they drowned from exhaustion.î (M ̧ller, p. 228; EA , p. 142) Well, this is Filip M ̧ller, Raul Hilbergís favorite Jewish witness, cited twenty times!óPerhaps Hilberg did not notice the following confes- sion on p. 271 ( EA , na) of M ̧llerís master work: ì [...] and I was not sure I had not dreamed the whole thing.î 181 John C.

Hilbergís Description of the Annihilation of the Jews in the Light of Technology and Toxicology The question, whether the things his witnesses describe are even pos- sible technically and natural scientifically, does not occupy a second of Hil- bergís time: What the witnesses said sounds right, and thatís good enough. For obvious reasons these questions have been raised only by Revision- ists. 183 We discuss them here first with respect to the ëpure extermination campsí and then for Auschwitz. a. Diesel Motors as a Killing Weapon Hilberg says that the murders were committed with diesel motors in Be ≥ø ec and Treblinka and that the Saurer trucks used for killing persons in Che ≥ mno were also equipped with diesel motors. Hilberg claims 1.45 mil- lion Jews were killed by this method (750,000 in Treblinka, 550,000 in Be ≥ø ec and 150,000 in Che ≥ mno). The suitability of diesel exhaust gas for purposes of mass murder has been addressed most thoroughly by German-American engineer Friedrich P. Berg, 57 whose analysis we summarize here briefly: While it is not in principle impossible to kill people with diesel exhaust gas, it is very difficult, since the latter contains very little poisonous carbon monoxide. While with a gasoline motor one can easily achieve a concentration of carbon monoxide of seven percent or more per cubic meter of air, with a diesel motor one cannot produce a concentration of carbon monoxide of even one percent. Experiments on animals have shown that it is impossible to kill the occupants of a diesel-fed gas chamber within the half hour claimed by the witnesses. 184 It would take at least three hours, and the motor would have to be run constantly under a heavy load. 185 In these circumstances, the fact that the motor might break down several times a day would also have to be taken into account. 186 This in turn means the motor 183 The only supporter of the theory of the annihilation of the Jews who has studied the technical aspects of the ëHolocaustí is Jean-Claude Pressac, but his analysis is technically unsound; on this cf.

T HE K ILLING C ENTERS would have to be overhauled frequentlyówhile the lines of the condemned lengthened outside the gas chamber. The relative innocuousness of diesel motor exhaust is well known. It was for this reason that only diesel motors were allowed in the tunnel being built between England and France. If the Germans actually succeeded in murdering millions of Jews in record time and in disposing of their corpses without a trace, they were technical geniusesóbut no technical genius would resort to a highly inefficient killing weapon. The gasoline motor which Hilberg says was installed in SobibÛr would have done better as a killing weapon. However, in 1991 the Enzyk- lop‰die des Holocaust stated that the killing weapon in SobibÛr was a diesel motor. Perhaps Hilberg and the Enzyklop‰die will soon drop both the gaso- line motor and the diesel motor and decide that the 200,000 to 250,000 mur- ders in SobibÛr were committed with ì a spirally, black substance dripping through holes in the ceiling î, as the persuasive Soviet-Jewish witness Alex- ander Pechersky stated in 1946. At that time, at least, ëmemoriesí were still fresh. b. Removal of Corpses in the ëPure Extermination Campsí: Case Study Be ≥ø ec A principle of criminology is: Without a body there has been no mur- der! This rule is held to except where it can be proven that a body has been completely obliterated. Where then, are the corpses of the 1.65 million per- sons gassed in the ëpure extermination campsí? Where are the remains of the gigantic open air incinerations? We are told that the 1.65 million dead were first buried in mass graves and later disinterred and incinerated. If these mass graves ever existed, the earth displacements caused by making them should still be dis- tinguishable. Especially, they should be easily identifiable with aerial pho- tography, due to altered topography and vegetation. Air photo expert John Ball has demonstrated how the aerial photography over Treblinka, Be ≥ø ec and SobibÛr in 1944 shows no trace of large-scale movements of earthó which compels one to the the conclusion that the gigantic mass graves for the interment of hundreds of thousands of corpses were never there. 187 Unlike Raul Hilberg, we have visited the sitesóbut for research, not for photo sessionsówhere the ëHolocaustí supposedly unfolded, including Be ≥ø ec. 188 The slightly sloping place on the grounds of the former camp 187 John C.

It is markedly higher than the site where the gas chamber supposedly stood. Apparently, the Germans arranged their mass murder operation such that they would have to haul 550,000 or more bodies uphill! Let us examine the technical preconditions for the claimed incinera- tion without a trace of 550,000 corpses in Be ≥ø ec. (With respect to the other ëextermination campsí the numbers should be modified in proportion to the claimed number of victims.) Hilberg says that between late Fall 1942 and March 1943, or, in other words, within four to five months at most, 550,000 corpses of gassed Jews were incinerated in at first one, and then two, incin- eration areas. Because of the frequent rain and snowfall at that time of year, we assume that the incinerations would have required 300 kg of wood per corpse, 189 meaning the total quantity of wood required would have been 165,000 tons. As has already been mentioned in chapter IV, open air incin- eration leaves behind human ashes amounting to approximately 5% of body weight. If we assume the latter was 50 kg, since if this was a mass murder there must have been many children among the victims, one body would leave behind 2.5 kg ashes; thus there would have been (550,000 ◊ 2.5 =) 1,375,000 kg or 1,375 metric tons of ashes. There also would have been wood ashes, whose quantity varies depending on the type of wood, but can- not be less than 3 kg per ton of wood, 190 so that in Be ≥ø ec there would have been at least 495 tons of it. All told, after the mass incinerations there would have been nearly 2,000 metric tons of ashes. In this there would have been countless bones and teeth. Where did the wood come from? How far from the camp did the inmates have to walk or be transported to cut this enormous amount of wood? How many inmates were required? How many tree cutting saws? Wedges? Wagons or trucks? Horses? Meals in the distant forests? How many guards to keep the inmates from escaping? Where was the wood stacked and aged and protected from the frequent rain or snow? Was it split into small mieces for quick burning? Small cuts are better for green wood to be used right away. How were the Germans able to dispose of the huge piles of ashes and the millions of pieces of bone and teeth? How could the 550,000 corpses have been incinerated in the open without the inhabitants of the town of Be ≥ø ec, one kilometer distant, noticing itóthe enormous 189 Arnulf Neumaier states, based on a newspaper report, that in India, where open air cremations are common even today, 306 kg are required, on average (ì The Treblinka Holocaust î, op. cit. (note 43), p. 490). In Poland in late Fall and Winter it would be even greater, but we will stay with 300 kg, so as not to be accused of exaggerating. 190 Ibid. , p. 371."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"101 VII. T HE K ILLING C ENTERS amount of black smoke and the smell of human flesh burning had to be quite noticeableóand reporting it to the resistance movement? The latter was kept closely informed of events occurring at the local level in Poland and provided the exile government in London with a ceaseless stream of reports on developments in the country. 191 They reported nothing about a huge fire at Be ≥ø ec burning for monthsówere their couriers blind? c. Zyklon B as a Killing Weapon For a hypothetical mass gassing of humans with the disinfestation agent Zyklon B, it should be kept in mind that at normal temperatures it takes two hours for the hydrogen cyanide to escape the carrier substance. This slow rate of evaporation of the product was intended by its developers. For one thing, it made it possible for the application crew to leave the disin- festation chamber safely after spreading out the poison. 192 For another, the slow emission of the gas meant that a high concentration of poison gas could be achieved for an extended period of time, even when the gassed space was not air-tight and leaked gas. In this way the gas could penetrate to the farthest corners of the gassed building and kill the parasites dwelling there. Therefore, even given the existence of an effective ventilation sys- tem, the ventilation of a hypothetical Zyklon B killing gas chamber could not have been done sooner than two hours after the Zyklon granules were poured out, and also the Sonderkommando would have had to wait a consid- erable time for the ventilation to complete before they could enter the cham- ber. This they could have done only when wearing gas masks. Also they would certainly have needed protective suits, because the clearing of rooms crammed full of corpses would be sweaty work, and dangerous because hydrogen cyanide is a contact poison which can be easily absorbed by moist skin. The witness statements stand in irreconcilable contradiction to these requirements. If several millions of people were murdered in Auschwitzó and such numbers were given in almost all of the witness statements cited by Hilberg from the immediate post-war period, even if he will not mention itóthe gassing must have been done quickly with high throughput. Let us look at what a few of Hilbergís witnesses say on this subject: 191 On this, see J. Graf and C. Mattogno, op. cit.

Two hours after they started, the whole operation is over, and Himmler can drive off to lunch! ñ Friedman says that the gas chambers could handle 4,000 to 5,000 victims per hour .

In contrast to the samples from the disinfestation chambers, they showed no significant concentrations of cyanide. d. The Practical Course of the Gassings in Crematories II and III in Birkenau, as Told by Hilberg Hilberg recapitulates the witness testimony briefly as follows: ìAn SS man [...] lifted the glass shutter over the lattice and emptied one can after another into the gas chamber. [...] Within fifteen minutes (sometimes five), everyone in the gas chamber was dead. The gas was now allowed to escape and after about half an hour, the door was opened. [...] The Jewish work parties (Sonderkommandos) , wear- ing gas masks, dragged out the bodies near the door to clear a path [...] î (pp. 1042f.; DEJ , pp. 975f.) On the size and holding capacity of the morgue cellars used as gas chambers he writes: ìThe Leichenkeller were very large (250 square yards) [200 m 2 ] , and 2,000 persons could be packed into each of them.î (p. 947; DEJ , p. 884) The impossibility of the gassing process as described by the wit- nesses can be seen by examining the accompanying illustration. 199 Analysis of air-reconnaissance photographs from 1944, study of the original con- struction plans of the SS Central Construction Office in Auschwitz and architectural investigation of the present structures proves that there were no holes in the roof of the supposed gas chamber during the war. This led Professor Robert Faurisson to compose his now famous four-word motto: No HolesóNo ëHolocaustí!

The Claimed Incineration of Sometimes 10,000 Corpses Daily in Birkenau Indeed, as Hilberg states on p. 946 ( DEJ , p. 884), the four cremato- ries in Birkenau put into operation from March 1943 possessed 46 firing chambers in all (15 each in Crematories II and III, 8 each in Crematories IV and V). The cremation of one corpse in a muffle takes, as has already been mentioned, on average one hour. Considering the fact that a coke-burning oven such as installed by the Topf firm in Birkenau cannot be operated con- tinuously twenty-four hours a day, day in and day outóit must be cleaned regularly, and it needs to cool off before being cleanedówe assume a twenty hour period of operation, and even that is probably too high. In that case the 46 muffles at Birkenau had a maximam daily capacity of 920 corpses per day; we round this off to 1,000, to allow for the presence of chil- drenís corpses. In view of these plain facts, the document cited by Hilberg on p. 1045 ( DEJ , p. 978), supposedly a letter dated 28th June 1943 from the Central Construction Office at Auschwitz, in which the daily throughput for Crema- tories II and III was put at 1,440 each and for Crematories IV and V at 768 each, is certainly a forgeryóprobably of Soviet origin. ( DEJ has a typo, giving as capacity of Crematories IV and V 268 each instead of 768.) 202 Even in the Third Reich, technically impossible things did not happen. Because the existence of the incineration pits reported by Filip M ̧ller and other witnesses is refuted by the air-reconnaissance photo- graphs, the incineration capacity claimed by Hilberg (10,000 corpses or more per day) is greater than the theoretical maximum possible by a factor of tenóand as a practical matter very much more, since we know from the investigations of Mattogno/Deana and Pressac that the crematories were noted for their frequent breakdowns, which would reduce their capacity drastically. The only possible scientific conclusion is that the supposed many hundred thousand-fold murder of Jews in spring and fall 1944 could not have happened, because cremations of this quantity was technically impos- sible. Bodies do not generally disappear all on their own, even in the Third Reich. 202 On this cf.

Hilbergís Statistics on Jewish Victims: Anatomy of Another Fraud 1. The ëThree Categories of Victimsí In his third volume, Hilberg discusses the Jewish population losses in the areas under German rule (pp. 1280-1300; DEJ , pp. 1199-1220). The rel- evant subchapter is entitled ì Statistics of Killed Jews î, although ëStatistics of Deaths of Jewsí would be more precise, because the statistics also include Jews who died in the camps and ghettos from epidemics, exhaustion and other causes. (In DEJ this subject is put in an appendix, entitled ì Statis- tics of Jewish Dead .î) Hilberg counts 5.1 million Jewish victims (p. 1300; DEJ , p. 1220) and misses the classical number six million by almost a mil- lion. On p. 1282 ( DEJ , p. 1202) he writes: ìAny assessment based on additions must reflect the origins and meanings of the numbers found in wartime documents. The large majority of these figures stems from an actual count of the victims. By and large, the numbers fall into three categories: deaths as a result of (1) privation, princi- pally hunger and disease in ghettos, (2) shootings, and (3) deportations to death camps.î That the victim counts Hilberg postulates ì reflect ... numbers found in wartime documents î, of which ì the large majorityÖ stems from an actual count î, is, as we have said several times, pure flummery. On p. 1299 ( DEJ , p. 1219) Hilberg identifies how victims in these three categories met their deaths. Here is his table in simplified form: Death camps: 2,700,000 dead or less Camps with low death counts, incl. labor and transit camps: 150,000 dead Romanian and Croatian camps: 150,000 dead or less Ghettos incl. Theresienstadt and privation outside ghettos: 800,000 dead or more Open-air shootings (USSR, Serbia and ì elsewhere î): 1,300,000 dead T OTAL APPROXIMATELY :  5,100,000   DEAD First, on the victims of open-air shootings; because of the insignifi- cant number of Serbian Jews we restrict ourselves to the Soviet Union."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"108 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY On pp. 409f. ( DEJ , p. 390) Hilberg has attributed shootings of more than 900,000 Soviet Jews to the Einsatzgruppen, and adds, these correspond to ì only about two-thirds of the total number of Jewish victims in mobile operations î. Therefore, 1.35 million Soviet Jews must have been killed. On p. 1300 ( DEJ , p. 1220) he gives a far smaller number; he counts the number of Jewish victims in the Soviet Union as ì over 700,000 î, of which ì up to 130,000 î were in Lithuania, 70,000 were in Latvia and ì over 1,000 î were in Estonia (in DEJ , 2,000); given these statistics, the number of Jews killed in the territories of the Soviet Union, including the Baltic area can hardly have exceeded 900,000. What accounts for the difference of 450,000 as com- pared to the earlier number? Possibly Hilberg has lumped in the Jews who fled from west to east in Poland following the partition of Poland in Fall 1939 who were overtaken and killed by the German army after 22nd June 1941 with the figure of 900,000 Soviet Jewish victims in the second set of statistics. If there were 450,000 of them, they should have been subtracted from the number of Pol- ish Jewish victims, but on p. 1300 ( DEJ , p. 1220) Hilberg says there were ì up to 3 million î of the latter. Since, as he tells us, there were 3.351 million Jews in Poland in August 1939, shortly before the German invasion (p. 1288; DEJ , na), there cannot have been 3 million of these annihilated in Poland itself and 450,000 in the USSR if the Germans had exterminated all of Polish Jewry without exception. So it is clear from the start that Hilberg is playing with marked cards. Hilberg says the number of Jews who died in the ëcommoní concen- tration camps Dachau, Buchenwald, Mauthausen and Stutthof and also in work and transit camps was 150,000, which is in the realm of possibility. 203 We can say nothing on the victim count of 150,000 ascribed to Romanian and Croatian camps because we have not studied these camps. There remain the 800,000 victims in the ghettos and those resulting from privation outside the ghettos. How in heavenís name does Hilberg arrive at this number? Most Polish Jews were supposedly fetched from the ghettos and transported to the ëextermination campsí and gassed there, and the Jews from the ghettos in the USSR were allegedly shot when the ghettos were broken up. Does Hilberg count these deaths twice? Apparently yes, because otherwise the desired final totals would never be reached! 203 In Poland there were hundreds of small work camps which were not considered outlying camps of the official concentration camps. An overview of these camps can be found in the work published by the G ≥ owna Komisja Badania Zbrodni Hitlerowskich w Polsce (Head Commission for the Investigation of Hitler Crimes in Poland) entitled Obozy Hitlerowskie na Ziemiach Polskich , Panstwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, Warsaw 1979."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"109 VIII.

Let us examine Hilbergs statistics for three critical countries. 2. Hungary In 1944 Hungarian Jews were indisputably visited with two great deportations. Between May and July most of the Jews living outside Budap- est were deported, mostly to Auschwitz. According to the dispatches of the German special ambassador in Budapest, Edmund Veesenmayer, the num- ber of deportees was 437,402. The operation was stopped on 7th July by Hungarian Regent Miklos Horthy and the Jews of Budapest were spared. In October, after the fall of Horthy and the seizure of power by Arrow Cross forces (Hungarian National Socialists) under Ferenc Szalasi, many thou- sand Hungarian Jews were driven to the borders of the Reich in forced marches to build fortifications against a Soviet invasion. Of the first deportations the Enzyklop‰die des Holocaust writes: 204 ìMost of the Hungarian Jews were gassed shortly after their arrival in Auschwitz-Birkenau.î Hilberg also asserts (on p. 1000; DEJ , p. 936) that ì the great bulk î of Hungarian deportees in 1944 ì were gassed in the Auschwitz killing center upon arrival î. On the other hand, in a table on p. 1300 ( DEJ , p. 1220) deal- ing with ì Deaths by Country î, he gives the total number of Hungarian-Jew- ish victims as ì over 180,000 î. Because this must include the deaths from the second deportation, carried out in October 1944, then, of the 437,000 displaced between May and July, clearly less than 180,000 met their deaths and thus many more than half survived the war. Thereby Hilberg undercuts his own assertion that ì the great bulk î was gassed. Where were people sent who did not die in Auschwitz? Hilberg mentions several thousand trans- ferred elsewhere (pp. 999f.; DEJ , na). What happened to the others? The readers are never told. Nor are they told where Hilberg has gotten his figure of 180,000 Hungarian-Jewish victims. Because the claimed mass annihilation in Birkenau cannot have taken place due to its radical technical impossibility, it is likely that the actual 204 v. III, p. 1467."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"110 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY population losses of Hungarian Jews did not exceed several tens of thou- sands. Auschwitz was probably a transit camp ( Durchgangslager ) for the Hungarian Jews who were not registered there. The proven transfers from Auschwitz to Stutthof 205 mesh with this description closely. 3. Poland Someone not familiar with the difficulties of population statistics might think that the demographic losses of Jews in Poland could be deter- mined by subtracting the number of Jews living there after the war from the number living there before the war. This is the method used in, among oth- ers, the collected work edited by the notorious Prof. Wolfgang Benz, Dimension des Vˆlkermords , 206 in which the concept of Jewish emigration does not appear. Hilberg concedes magnanimously that 15,000 Polish Jews emigrated ì to Palestine and other areas î during the war and that ì thou- sands î survived in the territories annexed by the Soviet Union or were deportated by the Soviets (p. 1293; DEJ , p. 1213). He says ì up to 3 million î Polish Jews died (p. 1300; DEJ , p. 1220), which is almost 90% of the (claimed) 3.351 million alive before the war. This three million number is a pure fantasy. For one thing, the start- ing number is too high, since the last Polish census before the war, accord- ing to which 3,113,033 Jews lived in Poland, took place in 1931 and, according to the Institute for Contemporary History in Munich, during the decade of the ë30s some 100,000 Jews a year emigrated from Poland. 207 After Poland was partitioned in Fall 1939 there was a massive flight of Jews out of the German half into the Soviet half. In his study The Dissolution , Sanning names numerous towns from which more than half the Jews had moved to the east. Although on 22nd June 1941 the Soviet occupied area of Poland came quickly under the control of the Wehrmacht, a large share of the Jews there fled with the Red Army and some had previously been deported further east by Stalinís willing executioners. According to a report in the United Press in February 1946, 800,000 Jews still lived in Poland. 208 The following facts should also be noted: ñ immediately after the end of the war numerous Polish Jews emi- grated to America, Palestine and other places; 205 Cf. chapter VI.5. 206 Published 1991 by R.

H ILBERG í S S TATISTICS ON J EWISH V ICTIMS : A NATOMY OF A F RAUD ñ most Polish Jews who had fled to the USSR stayed there; ñ many Polish Jews who remained in Poland after the war changed their names and were difficult to recognize as Jews. 209 We do not possess reliable figures for this problem, so it is not possi- ble to calculate Jewish population losses in Poland even approximately. In any case, of Hilbergís up to three million deaths, the imaginary gassing vic- tims should be subtracted (most of the 1.65 exterminated in the ëpure exter- mination campsí and a substantial number of those killed in Auschwitz were supposedly Polish Jews). The probable magnitude of Jewish losses in Poland is up to several hundred thousand and truly a tragedy. 4. The Soviet Union The census of 1939 showed 3.02 million Soviet Jews, but in 1940 the American Jewish Yearbook 210 reported that there were 5.5 million. This can only be explained if a large share of Polish, Baltic and Romanian Jewry were absorbed by the USSR. According to the census of 1959, 2.267 mil- lion Jews lived in Soviet lands. However, in the Soviet census every citizen could give the nationality that he thought he belonged to and large numbers of Soviet Jews had assimilated; the latter no longer regarded themselves as Jews, but as Russians, Ukrainians, and so on. In addition, a powerfully anti- Zionist mood was prevalent and an acknowledgement of being Jewish might have brought harassment with it. On 1st July 1990ólong after the beginning of emigration to Israel and to the USAóthe New York Post referred again to five million Soviet Jews. Because of this unholy chaos of numbers, it is clear that it is not pos- sible to come to a reliable estimate of the extent of Soviet-Jewish population losses in the Second World Waróquite apart from the fact that one also must take account of Jewish members of the Red Army fallen in battle as well as Jewish civilians who died of starvation in areas that were not Ger- man occupied, whose deaths were not due to German persecution measures and had nothing to do with the ëHolocaustí. 5. Summary Hilbergís figure of approximately 250,000 deaths of Jews in German concentration, work and transit campsóto be clearly distinguished from 209 On this, cf. for example, Jozef Pawlikowski, ì Einige Anmerkungen zu j ̧dischen Bevˆlkerungs- statistiken î, VffG , 2(1) (1998), pp. 36f.

Jews who died in Auschwitz and Majdanek of sickness, exhaus- tion and so on, should also be included in this number. Of the maximum 210,000 deaths incurred at these two camps, 211 some 60% were probably Jewish. This means that at most some 350,000 Jews could have met their deaths in German camps. The mass shootings in the Soviet Union, the mis- ery in the ghettos and the evacuation of the camps in the last months of the war could not have cost more than several hundred thousand Jewish lives. The final figure of Jewish population losses must be much less than one million. This estimate is confirmed by the investigations of Swedish researcher Carl Nordling. Based on the biographical data of the first 722 Jewish personalities listed in the Encyclopaedia Judaica in 1972 who lived in their European homelands when the war began, he determined that of these, 44% emigrated, 35% remained in their homelands but were spared deportations or internment, 8% were deported but survived and 13% died. 212 In his study based exclusively on Jewish and Allied statistics, W. Sanning comes to the conclusion that not more than 3.5 million Jews were subject to German power, meaning that that they lived in the German area of influence at the time when the ëHolocaustí was supposedly transpiring. 213 Let us assume that Sanningís number is too low and that the number of Jews living in the German area of control was 5 million. Let us also assume that Nordlingís statistics are not representative and that not 13%, but 20% of Jews died in the German area of control. In this case, the number of Jewish victims would run to one millionóonly a fifth of Hilbergís ëcalculatedí or invented number. Hilbergís methods can be quite clearly seen in his treatment of the demographically key country Poland. He ignores the massive emigration of Jews out of Poland before the war, downplays the mass flight of Polish Jews into the USSR in 1939, lets innumerable ëvictims of gassing in the extermi- nation campsí, die a second time as ëkilled in shootings behind the eastern frontí or ëperished in the ghettosí, does not bother to mention the many hun- dreds of thousands of Polish Jews who emigrated after the war and pays no attention to the fact that many Polish Jews were no longer recognized as such after 1945. One could not shift and chop statistics any more dishon- estly than our Giant has done! 211 Cf. notes 106 and 107 in chapter VII.2. 212 Revue díHistoire RÈvisionniste , 2 (1990), pp. 50-64 (http://vho.org/F/j/RHR/2/Nordling50-64.html). 213 W.

Conclusions During the Second World War the Jews in the countries of Europe controlled by Germany suffered massive persecutions and paid a high price in blood. In a labor over forty years, Raul Hilberg has assembled an immense number of documents on these events. Based on these documents, he could have written a work entitled The Persecution of the European Jews ( Die Verfolgung der europ‰ischen Juden ) that would have stood the test of time and earned him a name as a historian of the first rank. Raul Hilberg has spoiled his chance. He wanted to document not only the persecution of the European Jews, but also, and mainly, the destruction of same, by which he meant mainly the industrialized mass murder in chem- ical slaughterhouses. He had an agenda. There is no tangible physical evidence of any such industrialized mass murder, and in the mountains of documents that have been saved from the war years there is not the least indication to it. In order to ëproveí this mass murder, Hilberg has had to invert the long-standing hierarchy of evi- dence and make witness testimony take precedence over physical and docu- mentary evidence. Instead of the latter, we have the testimony of a Rudolf Hˆfl, who confessed to having visited in June 1941 the camp Treblinka, which opened in July 1942, of a Kurt Gerstein, who maintains that in Be ≥ø ec one could squeeze 32 persons into a square meter, of a Filip M ̧ller, who tells us that when corpses were incinerated the fat ran down in channels from which one could scoop it out with dippers. In 1982, Hilberg responded to the Revisionists who had reproached him with faulty methodology with the following argument: 219 ìThe critics cannot explain one very simple fact: What became of the people who were deported? The deportations were not kept secret. They were announced. Many millions of people were shipped to very specific places. Where are these people? They are certainly not hiding in China!î 219 Le Nouvel Observateur , 3rd-9th July 1982, pp. 70 ff."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"118 J ‹RGEN G RAF ∑ T HE G IANT W ITH F EET OF C LAY Indeed, where are these people? Hilberg is right that they are not hid- ing in China. Where they ended up is illustrated by an article on 24th November 1978 in the State Times (Baton Rouge, Louisiana, p. 8a): ìThe Steinbergs once flourished in a small Jewish village in Poland. That was before Hitlerís death camps. Now more than 200 far-flung survi- vors and descendants are gathered here to share a special four-day celebra- tion that began, appropriately, on Thanksgiving day. Relatives came Thursday from Canada, France, England, Argentina, Columbia, Israel and at least 13 cities across the United States. ëItís fabulousí, said Iris Krasnow of Chicago. ëThere are five generations hereófrom 3 months old to 85. Peo- ple are crying and having a wonderful time. Itís almost like a World War II refugee reunioní.î These are concrete examples of Hilbergís ëgassing victimsí! In a society which has chosen the lie as its leitmotif, Raul Hilberg is honored for his work. Yet his fame is built on sand, and he is a giant with feet of clay whose fall is only a question of time. A fair judgment of Hilbergís work was unwillingly made by himself. In a letter to Dr. Robert H. Countess, the responsible publisher of this book, Prof. Raul Hilberg wrote on June 21, 1988: ìSuperficiality is the major disease in the field of Holocaust studies.î When asked whether he once stated that there is no quality control in holocaust studies, he confirmed this in 2000: 220 ìThat is correct, especially at several U.S. elite universities.î And the University of Vermont, Hilbergís Alma Mater, is defintely one of them. Let us conclude with a passage from Robert Faurisson: 221 ìR. Hilbergís huge work is reminiscent of the erudite undertakings of bygone eras, when Christian, Jewish and Byzantine scholars competed with each other in the production of all kinds of literary or historical forgeries. Their knowledge excited admiration, but what they lacked was conscience. There is a striking similarity between R. Hilberg with his ëremarkable cab- balistic mentalityíóto borrow a phrase from A.R. Butzóand those Jews of Alexandria, who, Bernard Lazare tells us, ëexpended an extraordinary amount of labor to forge the very texts which they used to support them- selves in their fight for their causeí.î 220 Eva Schweitzer, ì R ̧cksicht auf die Verb ̧ndeten î, Berliner Zeitung , Sept. 4, 2000. 221 Robert Faurisson, ...crits rÈvisionnistes ... , op. cit.
