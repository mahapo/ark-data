Of course, it does raise the question of exactly what is \"taxable income\"... \"... 'income', as used in the statute should be given a meaning so as not to include everything that comes in\". United States Supreme Court, So. Pacific v. Lowe, 247 U.S. 330,(1918) \"Inclusio unius est exclusio alterius. The inclusion of one is the exclusion of another.

"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code It was not until the late 1990's, when the Internal Revenue Code was digitized (and thus made searchable) that it became possible to decipher its deliberately confusing and misleading construction. Only then could complete searches be done of all 3,413,780 or so words (not counting regulations!) for every incidence of \"liable\", \"imposed\", \"income\", \"employee\", and dozens of other key or misleading terms-- checking every reference, exception, definition and source. Only then could it be established that, as written, the laws behind the code and the taxes that they impose technically comply with the Constitution, just as all the ju dges have said over the years. But the same analysis also reveals that, as written, these laws don't apply to most of the receipts of most private citizens. Indeed, the two things are interdependent- the former couldn't be true unless the latter was also true. What you will learn as you read this book is that specific Constitutional limitations on th e federal government's power to tax do shape related law, and have generated a coherent Supreme Court doctrine which clearly and soundly answers the question of what is \"taxable income\". Both the statutes and the doctrine acknowledge the exemption of the vast majority of private-sector receipts from that taxing power's reach. However, you will also learn about a complex combination of craft, routine bureaucratic incoherence, and casual- and not-so-casual- corruption by virtue of which many people are led to inadvertently allow, and even participate in, the legal transformation of their untaxable earnings into \"taxable income\". Such people are tricked into voluntarily and utterly unnecessarily enabling the diversion of a river of wealth from their own hands, usually never to be seen again. Thanks to an unhappy coincidence of reiterations and amendments of the law, a series of complicated judicial rulings, and the passage of time and memories, the details of American"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Foreword tax law— and the principles upon which it is based- have come to be widely misunderstood. The opportunities presented by that reality have been seized upon, by those paid to maximize revenue flow to the government, to successfully construct an elaborate and deceptive tax scheme rooted in today's Internal Revenue Code. This scheme capitalizes on widespread public ignorance of general legal doctrine and rules of statutory construction. It practices a careful gauging of extraction levels to the tolerance limits of key demographic segments. It relies upon the concealment of the underlying actual-law-in-force behind the misleading words of the code, which is legally no more than 'evidence of the law', and not the law itself. Fundamental to the scheme is designing that code to be so dauntingly and profoundly confusing as to force the vast majority of those against whom it's directed to abandon even a pretense of personal comprehension. These targets are thus compelled to surrender their decision-making to the code's administrative bureaucracy or a professional class of fixers and go-betweens- the members of either of which are dependent on the scheme for their own earnings. Unsurprisingly, both assure any who ask that of course private-sector receipts are taxed under the law. If pressed, these experts will trot out carefully selected, out-of-context and ambiguous fragments of law calculated to convincingly suggest that what they claim must be in the law, somewhere. But somehow, they never manage to demonstrate exactly where. 'Cracking the Code' is going to provide that missing context, unravel the tangle of deceit and confusion, and make clear that not only is it not in there anywhere, what is in there is just the opposite. Plainly stated, the \"income\" tax scheme is an utterly corrupt and corrosive fraud feeding an ever-more insatiable appetite of a swollen cadre of politically astute private interests and their camp-followers by way of a deliberate campaign of"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code disinformation, intimidation and cunning. It facilitates almost incomprehensible harm to the well-being of all of the rest of us both by the nature and peripheral effects of its implementation, and by the practices and policies which the wealth it transfers make possible.

It is also my hope that the reader will agree th at in this instance, as is the case in so many others, looking after our own interest serves those of society as well. It was not, after all, for idle reasons that the founders imposed strict Constitutional limitations on the taxing power of the federal government. Nor was it merely to protect their own property. Such limitations are essential to meaningful security and the preservation of liberty. As John Adams said, \"The moment the idea is admitted into society that property is not as sacred as the laws of God, and there is not a force of law and public justice to protect it, anarchy and tyranny commence.\" ***** The reader will observe a predisposition of focus throughout this book on receipts from labor, either traded as an \"embedded\" worker (common-law employee) or as a \"free- lance\" worker (contractor); as oppo sed to receipts in the form of interest derived from capital, and the like. This is because such receipts from work represent far-and-away both the biggest pool of wealth and the biggest pool of citizens from which taxes are scammed away. Some will object to this stat istical assertion, having read a hundred times about how the \"wealthy\"- read coupon- clipping fat cats- pay a grossly disproportionate share of the tax burden, and one amounting to the lion's share of the total. These urban legends are reflective of the misunderstandings essential to the success of the tax scheme. While the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Foreword \"wealthy\"-- read persons who have produced considerable value for their neighbors, and have been paid a corresponding amount of money- do indeed pay a disproportionate share (as, if anything, their demand on the public expense is less than that of others), the aggregate percentage of the total tax extraction paid by households with annual receipts over $200,000 is less than one third of the total. A significant contributor to the erroneous assertions in this regard is a failure to understand that \"FICA contributions\" are nothing more than \"income\" taxes indistinguishable both legally and practically from any other, something which will be discussed in greater detail as we proceed. By themselves such \"contributions\", every penny of which is paid by workers, made up more than 34% of the total federal tax extraction in 2001 (source: OMB). However, those readers for wh om interest derived from capital, and similar receipts, are of paramount concern should note that every principle and point regarding the lawful nature of taxable \"income\" found herein also apply to that class of receipt- and will find them, and the information about the structure and nature of the tax laws, illuminating, invigorating and utilitarian.

In light of the obvious unconstitutionality of the \"income\" tax— as enforced against private citizens within the 50 states- the failure of the court to declare it so seemed an incontrovertible indictment. At the very least, respect for the rule of law demanded that the apparently incomprehensible statute be ruled void for vagueness, but for all the many years that this tax has been with us, it has been permitted to remain, largely unscathed. Last year, my faith was restored. Well, that's actually far too strong a statement— the court still has much to answer for, regarding the \"income\" tax and a good deal else. But as far as the Constitutionality of that tax as written is concerned, all is well, for the IRC passes Constitutional muster.

However, though coerced into producing the form in the typical fashion, I would not allow myself to be compelled to attest to what I knew to be untrue, and so always added to the perjury statement above the signature lines the words, \"except insofar as the term \"income\" is misused herein.\" This was a reference to the general and explicit presumptive characterization of all wages, salaries, and similar compensations as \"income\" on the forms and within the instructions. (In 1992 I provided a page length attachment to make this statement, then used the EZ version thereafter). I knew perfectly well that such things, insofar as they have to do with me, cannot be taxable \"inc ome\", at least not unless I, by endorsing such a characterization (or letting it stand unchallenged) made them so. For 9 years, even after becoming free of this judge's dictates, this was the course of things: I (and eventually my wife Doreen) would fill in the forms, add the disclaimer and send them in, and the IRS would keep a whole lot of money which had been withheld from my earnings during the previous year while paying no attention to my small (but legally significant) protest. After all, I had just had a taste, actually a pretty big helping, of the disdain which a federal district court judge (and numerous attorneys on both the prosecutorial and defense side of the bar) apparently had for Constitutional limitations on the taxing power, and arguments based upon those limitations were all I was equipped to make. I was familiar with the work of others, such as Lynn Johnsto n and Irwin Schiff, who had made VIII"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Introduction some limited study of the tax code itself, but even their arguments still ended with the \"It doesn't matter what the code says, you can't Constitutionally tax me\" conclusion, basically the same approach that I had taken with mine, which had no currency in the courts. (Indeed, until the Cheeks case was ruled on by the Supreme Court in 1991, trial court judges routinely suppressed arguments based upon the Constitutionality of the tax, and even in ruling that Cheek's arguments had to be permitted, the Supreme Court itself declared them to be frivolous). Without such argument s, fighting it out in court seemed doomed, or at least an impossibly long shot. All of us faced the conundrum that the portions of the code that we had seen were ambiguous at best, and at worst seemed written in defiance of the Constitution; furthermore, who knew what else was to be found within that maze of lawless nonsense that maybe wa s less ambiguous, and against our position? So, I bided my time, added my disclaimer, wrote my monographs, and continued to study the issue, more-or-less patiently. I intended to resume my more active disagreement with the government on this issue soon enough, but my two children had been born since the start of my last close encounter with a federal court, and I was willing to wait until I was really ready before going back onto the battlefield. But the bad guys wouldn't wait. In autumn of 2001, for some reason probably born in mindless, banal bureaucratic perversity (though perhaps in recognition of my little disclaimer's nascent legal threat), the agency suddenly informed my wife and me that, because of the disclaimer, it refused to accept our return for 2000. The IRS argued, in essence, that without the endorsement of its characterization of our receipts by an unqualified perjury statement, our return could not be considered as legally filed.

If not, we would be considered in default, our deductions and exemptions would not be honored, and interest and penalties would apply and grow. We had no intention of backing down on this point, and so I began an analysis of the Internal Revenue Code (and other relevant materials) far more intense, and infinitely more productive, than any in which I had ever engaged- thanks to the marvelous capabilities now afforded to such research by the technology of the information age. This time, I could leapfrog about checking every obscure section reference; search the entire multi-million word document in seconds for every instance of key words and phrases; and draw upon the huge volume of data on the subject posted on the internet by others similarly engaged. This time, I could actually have the grotesque sprawl of incoherence on my screen in my own home. This time, I actually read the damned thing. The end result of this research was the epiphany regarding the Constitutionality of the code and the behavior of the Supreme Court to which I referred earlier. You will all be happy to learn that the court has been right about the lawfulness of the code, and so have I; Doreen and I have been able to file our last couple of returns with no clarification needed. When you're through with this book, you'll understand how. 'Cracking the Code' is not going to be an easy read. For one thing, there is necessarily a great deal of legal language in the form of statutes and judicial rulings.

The process of overcoming a vast body of multi- dimensional mis-information makes a purely linear exposition of the truth fruitless, if not impossible, and 'Cracking the Code' is organized accordingly. This is not to say that a linear presentation of the taxing statutes cannot be made. The problem is that to understand the statutes, which are written within a framework of constraints typically assumed by the writer to be known by the reader, it is necessary to understand those constraints as well. Some of these constraints are inherent in the principles of jurisdiction; some arise from the rules of statutory construction; others are imposed by the specifications of the Constitution and still more have evolved with Supreme Court jurisprudence. As understanding-- or even just a sense- of each of these diverse but related elements becomes incorporated into the reader's overall frame of reference, others which had seemed mysterious will become clear.

Understanding the principles of the two different classes of taxes, and the jurisdictional issues with which they are connected, is not critical to understanding the tax laws- the words with which those laws are written clearly express their meanings and limitations. Nonetheless, I believe a comprehension of why those laws are written as they are will be beneficial to the reader.

Any tax laid on property or people, and thus unavoidable, is a direct tax. Under the Constitution, federal direct taxe s which affect citizens of the several states must be apportioned. Apportionment means the division of the total cost of a tax (such as a $10 per house tax X 100 houses = $1000) among the states proportionate to their percentage of the total national population, with the resulting amount being due from the state. The state is free to collect the money however it wishes. Because of this Constitutional requirement, once someone has come into ownership of money or other property, by fulfilling the terms of a contract, through inheritance, by way of a dividend distribution or however it has been done, that property can only be taxed by means of an apportioned tax. Capitations, or taxes on people, must also be apportioned. CAPITA TION: A poll tax; an imposition which is yearly laid on each person according to his estate and ability.

Indirect people are rated according to their rank by an invariable tariff; the lower orders of pe ople, according to what is supposed to be their fortune, by an assessment which varies from year to year.\" This is how Adam Smith, the Father of Economics, defines and describes \"capitations\" in Book V, CH. II, Art. IV of his seminal treatise on economics and taxation, The Wealth of Nations'. This book, published in 1776, instantly rocketed to the heights as the absolute authority on these subjects throughout the Western World. It remains the single most comprehensive resource on the meaning of the Constitutional term \"capitation\". Smith deplores capitations as inequitable, inflationary, counterproductive, and destructiv e of liberty. Importantly, he makes clear that any tax levied upon and/or measured by the exercise of a basic right- such as the right to life, liberty, the ownership of property, working, or engaging in trade-- is a capitation. Indeed, capitations are alternately known as (and get their name from) \"head taxes\", because they fall directly upon the head of the citizen. They must be paid by the citizen, and out of his own funds— simply because he is there, maintaining and exercising his natural powers. The framers of the Constitution were avid and serious students of Smith's enormously popular work. (During the turmoil of the revolutionary war years alone, Americans bought the equivalent of more than 233, 000 copies if proportioned to today's population. This is a solid testament to the esteem in which this substantial and serious work— 976 pages of densely- packed small type in my copy- was held.) Agreeing wholeheartedly with his recognition of the evils of unchecked capitations, they specifically pr ohibited such practices in Article 1 of the Constitution.

Indirect taxes generally take the form of a return to the state of a portion of the benefit conveyed by a special privilege, such as the revenue from trade across the national borders, or the salary or other revenue from a public office. Indirect taxes can also be attendant upon the purchase of a taxed, optional article, by which transaction the vendor becomes liable for a tax paid with the consumer's money. All federal tax within the 50 states must be either direct or indirect- therefore they must all be either apportioned or optional. Applying these principles, we can see that while a tax on shopping in general would be a capitation, or direct tax; a tax laid upon some par ticular thing for whic h one might or might not shop at one's discretion would be indirect, and thus not a capitation. Similarly, a tax upon being a postal inspector, for instance, to which no one has a right, is an indirect tax; while a tax upon being a graphic artist, to which anyone has a right, would be a capitation. A tax accompanying each transaction involving a taxable article that takes place in your store is an indirect tax, while a tax on having your store open for such transactions-- even if you might be able to recover it from customers on any particular day- would be a capitation. Black's Law Dictionary, 5th edition, puts it succinctly, defining a \"direct tax\" as: \"One which is demanded from the very persons who it is intended or desired should pay it. Indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the expectation and intention that he should indemnify himself at the expense of another\".

Wallace 57 F.2d 877, 880 \"Excises are taxes laid upon the manufacture, sale or consumption of commodities within the country, upon licenses to pursue certain occupations and upon corporate privileges; the requirement to pay such taxes involves the exercise of privilege. \"Flint vs. Stone Tracy Co. 220 U.S. 107 (1911). \"A tax upon the privilege of selling property at the exchange,... differs radically from a tax upon every sale made in any place.\" \"A sale at an exchange differs from a sale made at a man s private office or on his farm, or by a partnership, because, although the subject- matter of the sale may be the same in each case, there are at an exchange certain advantages, in the way of finding a market, obtaining a price, the saving of time, and in the security of payment, and other matters, which are more easily obtained there than at an office or a farm.\" Nicol v.

Indirect \" No other items may be excluded from gross income except (a) those items of income which are, under the Constitution, not taxable by the Federal Government...\" (26 CFR § 39.22(b)-l (1956)) The Supreme Court has expressed the character of this limitation several different ways, among them by unambiguously and repeatedly striking down as unconstitutional over the years a number of attempted tax structures the objects of which could not be proven to be related to any delegated power of congress. In its most explicit declaration in this regard, the court says: \"all that Congress would need to do, hereafter, in seeking to take over to its control any one of the great number of subjects of public interest, jurisdiction of which the states have never parted with, and which are reserved to them by the Tenth Amendment, would be to enact a detailed measure of complete regulation of the subject and enforce it by a so-called tax upon departures from it. To give such magic to the word 'tax' would be to break down all constitutional limitation of the powers of Congress and completely wipe out the sovereignty of the states\". Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co., 259 U.S. 20 (1922) Such rulings illuminate and enforce the requirement upon Congress to confine its taxing efforts to activities associated with the implementation of its delegated authority, such as the conduct of public offices. We have the benefit of two recent (though indirect) examples of the effect and meaning of this recognition of the jurisdictional limitations on federal taxes. In the cases of United States v. Lopez 514 U.S. 546 ( 1995) and Jones v. United States, 99-5739, (2000), the U.S. Supreme Court threw out federal laws restricting the possession of a gun within 1000 feet of a school; and punishing arson; respectively.

It did not, because it cannot. Focusing the principles of the lawful limitations upon federal taxation on the \"income\" tax which we are about to particularly explore, we can per ceive that unprivileged, outside- of-federal-geographical-jurisdiction work cannot be taxed indirectly by the federal government. As the U.S. Supreme Court says in Butcher Union Co. v. Crescent City Co., 111 U.S. 746 (1883): \"The right to follow any of the common occupations of life is an inalienable right,...\" and, \"It has been well said that 'the property which every man has in his own labor, as it is the original foundation of all other property, so it is the most sacred and inviolable. The patrimony of the poor man lies in the strength and dexterity of his own hands, and to hinder his employing this strength and dexterity in what manner he thinks proper, without injury to his neighbor, is a plain violation of this most sacred property.\", and in Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U.S. 1 (1915): \"Included in the right of personal liberty and the right of private property- partaking of the nature of each- is the right to make contracts for the acquisition of property.

So, in 1862, in the first artless and innocent iteration of an American \"income\" tax, an excise with provisions for withholding is laid upon the pay of government workers. At the same time, a separate, essentially voluntary excise is laid upon \"gains, profits, or income'' 'that might be derived from the pay (or other sources) of private-se ctor United States residents and government workers alike. By its explicit, separate, and otherwise unnecessary identification in section 86 of the remuneration (pay) of government workers as taxable— and taxed- this original enactment provides a rare, forthright statutory acknowledgement that the remuneration of private-sectors workers is not. After all, if \"gains, profits, or income derived from\" pay is the same thing as the pay itself, the pay of government workers identified in section 86 would be being taxed under section 90, and the relevant portion of section 86 would be nonsensically superfluous.

The similar exclusion of private-sector receipts of any other kind from the legal category of'taxab le' is not, unfortunately, as lucidly spelled out in this act other than in their sharing the Implications of the qualifier \"derived from\" but is satisfactorily clarified elsewhere, as we shall see. Subsequent acts changed the rate, and eventually added progressivity, but the imposition of the tax, and the specifications of- and exclusions from-- its object remain. (There is a persistent factoid of misinformation to the effect that this 1862 act was repealed in 1872. While it is true that certain portions of the earlier act were repealed or modified in the revenue act of December 24th, 1872, sections 86, 90, and 93, reproduced above, were not among them. Enforcement of the \"income\" duty was temporarily relaxed at that time, but it was never repealed.) In 1880, the act was tested in the Supreme Court in Springer v. United States, 102 U.S. 586 (1880), by an litigant- attorney as a direct tax upon him in seeking a portion of the proceeds from his federally licensed profession and interest on bonds that he held. The court unremarkably ruled against him in a brief opinion of interest only due to an observation that to treat a tax on \"incomes\" as direct- and therefore apportioned— would be inequitable because, \"Where the population [of a state] is large and the incomes are few and small, it would be intolerably oppressive\". If \"income\" is understood as meaning 'pay', or 'all that comes in', the court's observation is gibberish. It's possible that one of the welfare states of today might come to have a large population with few people making a living, but in 1880 there certainly was no such place. With its observation, the court was matter-of-factly confirming the distinction between \"incomes\" 15"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code and the common receipts of privat e-sector persons, just as had the 1862 act. In 1894, Congress re-enacted the \"income\" tax- combining certain elements of the original sections 86 and 90 to explicitly require the inclusion of \"the salary or other compensation paid to any person in the employment or service of the United States... in the calculation of [taxable] total gains, profits or income\" of that person; and again providing for withholding. The new act was promptly challenged in the Supreme Court, insofar as it attempted to characterize dividends paid by an investment fund as taxable \"gains, profit, or income\". Ruling on the question in Pollock v. Farmers Loan & Trust, 157 U.S. 429 and 158 U.S. 601 (1895), the court made two important declarations prior to its final ruling, the first of which being, \"The power to tax real and personal property and the income from both, there being an apportionment, is conceded: that such a tax is a direct tax in the meaning of the Constitution has not been, and, in our judgment, cannot be successfully denied:...\". The court is saying that a tax connected with receipts from property already acquired was indistinguishable in essence from a tax upon the property itself- without regard to any exercise of privilege in deriving such receipts- because the mere possession of the property is meaningless without deriving gain from it. In other words, even otherwise taxable \"income\" is untaxable if connected with personally owned property.

It merely ruled that the measurement of the tax by receipts derived from the use of personal property is unconstituti onal, because the property itself is untaxable: \"The tax imposed by sections 27 to 37, inclusive, of the act of 1894, so far as it falls on the income of real estate, and of personal property, being a direct tax, within the meaning of the constitution, and therefore unconstitutional and void, because not apportioned according to representation, all those sections, constituting one entire scheme of taxation, are necessarily invalid.\" Like all of the \"income\" tax acts over the years, the act of 1894 had coyly declined to spell out what qualifies as \"income\", other than the compens ation of federal workers. It instructed government offices and agencies to treat and report their payments as such, by means which we will examine later, but left to all others the task of recognizing when the law does and does not apply to them.

His suit established only that such dividends and their like could not be treated as \"income\" even if associated with a taxable activity. Nonetheless, the case was enormously significant. In large part, the 1894 act had had its sights set on the huge profits being made by investments in ventures such as railroads, declared by the Supreme Court during the 1880's to amount to federal instrumentalities. The ruling thus took the meat-and- potatoes of the \"income\" tax's potential to the federal treasury off the table-- there wasn't much left by which the tax on federal salary \"income\" could be supplemented. In response to the Pollock ruling, the Sixteenth Amendment- \"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration.\"— was declared ratified in 1913, promptly followed in October of the same year by a new revenue act. Almost immediately, the Supreme Court had occasion to address the new amendment, in Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co., 240 U.S. 1 (1916). The plaintiff in the case, Frank Brushaber, sought to defeat the taxation of dividends from his railroad investments under the new act. He cleverly suggested that the definition of \"income\" to which it and the amendment referred should be understood as having been expanded so as to encompass the objects of a capitation or other direct tax, yet without apportionment. His notion was to exploit the various Constitutional problems which would naturally arise from such a misunderstanding.

The court also repeats and reinforces its declaration from the Pollock ruling that such a tax can only be laid as an excise-- noting that the Article 1, Section 9 Constitutional prohibition on unapportioned direct taxes had not been repealed. \" We are of opinion, however, that the confusion is not inherent, but rather arises from the conclusion that the 16th Amendment provides for a hitherto unknown power of taxation; that is, a power to levy an income tax which, although direct, should not be subject to the regulation of apportionment applicable to all other direct taxes. And the far-reaching effect of this erroneous assumption will be made clear by generalizing the many contentions advanced in argument to support it...\" \"But it clearly results that the proposition and the contentions under it, if acceded to, would cause one provision of the Constitution to destroy another; that is, they would result in bringing the provisions of the Amendment exempting a direct tax from apportionment into irreconcilable conflict with the general requirement that all direct taxes be apportioned.\" The court points out that the amendment had in no way modified or expanded the meaning of the word \"income\" as lawfully used in a taxing statute. Nor had it changed the requirement that the application of any such statute must be confined to the forms and proper subjects of an excise- licensed or privileged activities. It simply provided that the constitutionality of such a tax could no longer be challenged by reference to untaxable property connected with any particular \"income\". Such a challenge, in other words, can only argue against the taxability of the activity to which the \"income\" tax is being applied.

(Nonetheless, the 1913 act deploys careful language acknowledging \"income exempt from taxation by the fundamental law [ the Constitution]'' This acknowledgement subsequently moved into the re gulations associated with the revenue laws after their codification in 1939: 26 CFR § 39.21-1 (1956): Meaning of net income, (a) The tax imposed by chapter 1 is upon income. Neither income exempted by statute or fundamental law, nor expenses incurred in connection therewith, other than interest, enter into the computation of net income as defined by section 21. and, 26 CFR § 39.22(b)-l: Exemption—Exclusions from gross income. Certain items of income specified in section 22(b) are exempt from tax and may be excluded from gross income. These items, however, are exempt only to the extent and in the amount specified. No other items may be excluded from gross income except (a) those items of income which are, under the Constitution, not taxable by the Federal Government; Today's regulations put it this way: 26 CFR § 1.61-1 (Current) Gross income, (a) General definition. Gross income means all income from whatever source derived, unless excluded by law . ) The Brushaber court also seizes the opportunity to reaffirm the core element of the \"income\" tax by pointing out that the only way to square the Sixteenth Amendment with Article 1, Sections 2 and 9 of the Constitution was through a fixed, customized definition of what had been a legal term and 21"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code was now a Constitutional term : \"income\". Because a tax on \"income\" is necessarily an excise, whatever is thus taxed as \"income\" MUST be confined to such things to which an excise can properly be applied.

In the same year as the Brushaber decision, the court acknowledges the concurrent jurisdictional limitation of the taxing power of Congress in Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co, 240 U.S. 103 (1916): \"Mark, of course, in saying this we are not here considering a tax... entirely beyond the scope of the taxing power of Congress, and where consequently no authority to impose a burden, either direct or indirect, exists.

In its ruling in So. Pacific v. Lowe, 247 U.S. 330, (1918), for instance, the court says, \"...

The revenue acts, after all, draw, and can draw, no distinction what ever between the meaning of \"income\" to a corporation and the meaning of \"income\" to a natural person: \"It is obvious that these decisions in principle rule the case at bar if the word \"income\" has the same meaning in the Income Tax Act of 1913 that it had in the Corporation Excise Tax Act of 1909, and that it has the same scope of meaning was in effect decided in Southern Pacific Co. v.

The key virtue of this exercise will be in illuminating why, among other reasons, under this particular settled doctrine of the court private-sector proceeds of work (in particular) cannot be taxed under an \"income\" tax. Let's begin with a simple mental exercise: Suppose that you were a shepherd who needed a new pair of shoes. You 25"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code take a sheep down to your neighbor the cobbler, who trades you a pair of shoes for your sheep. You're both happy, you with the shoes that you didn't have before, and your neighbor with a week or two's worth of dinner. Did either of you receive \"income\" (defined, for the purpose of this exercise, solely as profit)? Clearly not. The market value of your sheep was equaled by the market value of the shoes, and neither you nor the cobbler made a profit. Now, let's suppose that, rather than carrying your sheep to the cobbler's, you gave him an IOU which can be redeemed for one sheep (or traded to someone else for one s heep's worth of value in other goods, who will trade for it knowing that they can redeem it for a sheep, or trade it away themselves). Now you've got the shoes and the cobbler has a claim on a sheep or its equivalent value. Any profits (\"income\") now? Of course not. OK, how about this- instead of an IOU for one of your sheep, you give the cobbler the note you're holding from your other neighbor, the carpenter, for a day's worth of carpentry, (or its equivalent, as explained earlier), that you got last week in trade for one of your sheep. Any profit or \"income\" now? Still no. And how about that carpenter, who redeems his note by doing a day's worth of work for the cobbler. When the cobbler gives him the note, debt paid, has the carpenter received \"income\"? Clearly not. No one received any \"income\" in our example because by merely trading what they already possessed for it's equivalent value in someone else's property, none of our citizens increased their wealth, they simply converted pre- existing assets to a differen t form. Some would make the argument that our carpenter is an exception, saying that he didn't really trade anything, he simply was paid for his time- getting something for nothing. That argument implies that an individual doesn't own, as a resource, his or her time/labor, leaving one to wonder to whom they would propose that it does belong; it also presumes or implies that the time/labor available 26"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Supreme Court And The Meaning Of \"Income\" to the carpenter, as to all of us, is not an all too finite resource-- an absurdity not worthy of rebuttal. I will dismiss such arguments with the observations that the consumer of the carpenter's work did not acquire its benefits by magic; and the carpenter could have spent his days making shoes like the cobbler or raising sheep like the shepherd if he wished, or studying to improve his skills. There is no practical difference between any of these choices, they are all just ways of using ones time/labor, and the specialization in one or the other toward which individuals naturally gravitate as they discover where their talents and interests lie simply maximizes the benefit to the whole community. Besides, the very fact that someone would offer value in exchange for the carpenter's time/labor establishes it as a legitimate tradable good. Douglas Adams, in 'Life, the Universe and Everything' one of the books in his wonderful 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' series, de scribes a society that elected to make leaves legal tender, imagining that with this choice they would immediately all be rich, and without any effort! Eventually, they are forced to burn down all the tree s, in order to curb inflation... It is vitally important for the sake of clear thinking to understand that a//tradable goods of any kind, including sheep and shoes as well as work (and by extension the notes or tokens, sometimes called money, used to facilitate the trading process), represent a unit of time/labor. If goods could be acquired without an expenditure of time/labor, they would have no value. They might still be desira ble, as air is desirable, even necessary, but of no tradable value due to being attainable without any effort. For instance if gold, a tradable good long used as a form of money, were as common as sand and as easily acquired, we might still like to wear it as jewelry but we 27"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code would not use it as money, for it would not represent any meaningful unit of time/labor. It can be used as money only because acquiring it requires effort in the mining process, both in locating and extracting it, rendering it a tradable good with an inherent value. The same is true of our shepherd's sheep. If a sheep could be had by anybody, anytime, by simply stepping outside and grabbing one- without hunting for it or husbanding it-- sheep would have no value, and neither the cobbler nor the carpenter would offer their goods in trade for one. The value in these goods comes from the time/labor expenditure necessary to acquire them. All tradable goods consist of time/labor, either converted to a hard product through the picking of the apples, the raising of the sheep, the making of the shoes, etc.; rendered in its original form as service (which is to say, doing the same things for someone else); or as a combination of the two. As an example of that last form, which is the most common form of tradable good in our complex economy, let us examine the shoemaker, who trades 'x' for his materials, and then sells (trades) his shoes for 'x + y'?! Surely he has made a profit, and acquired \"income\"?! What the shoemaker has done is mixed his time/labor, which is one of his resources, with his raw materials, creating more value for the raw materials as they become refined into a product of a different kind, but only to the same degree as the cobbler's expenditure of his time and energy. If the cobbler attempted to sell his shoes for more than the value of the resources consumed in the produc tion process, his customers, who also can acquire leather and thread, and also have time and energy, could make them for themselves. If those customers were to make that choice, and fashion their own shoes, they could surely not be charged with having received \"income\" represented by some calculation of the increased value of the leather and thread; no more can the cobbler. 28"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The Supreme Court And The Meaning Of \"Income\" This is not to say that the cobbler does not enjoy a competitive advantage in evaluating his goods for the market; he can take advantage of his greater experience and superior efficiency in making his products, making his expenditure relatively less than that faced by his customers in contemplating whether to buy or make their own. But that same advantage is enjoyed by all specialists in the market, and thus does not change the dynamic of trading value for equal value, with gain to none, and in any case does not represent some magical confusion of resource or value not originating from (and belonging to), the cobbler. (That any producer may also bring special artistry to his or her work, adding value beyond that of the other resources consumed, is true as well, but does not conflict with the basic point). Theoretically, we all could make our own consumable products, spending our time hunting for materials, and sitting around fashioning the things we need, we would simply lose the greater efficiency of specialization which provides for less cost of time/labor in production. Choosing the advantages of specialization, and the necessary mechanism of trade to actualize its benefits, does not add to our inherent personal resources despite allowing us to acquire more and better goods than we could make or acquire were we to live as hermits. All of our players in this example are participants in a specialization based market economy, the same market economy in which you and I participate in every detail, rendered a little tricky to perceive by the use of different terms for key Ingredients, most notably IOUs (or notes) for money, and the references to work as a tradable good. The money that we use today in the United States is simp ly IOUs which, for convenience and efficiency, we have recently (about a hundred years ago) decided should be written by a central authority for the sake of uniformity. After all, goes the argument, transactions are often wide-ranging in the players they involve and the distances and layers of ownership and obligation that they navigate. That 29"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code centralization removes from money the personal IOU obligation of the original notes. Thus a dollar bill, for example, no longer has the name of the carpenter on it, identifying him as the origin of the note and his time/labor as the backing for the notes value, because the mark et's participants all understand that everyone's notes are tradabl e for everyone's goods, since everyone's tradable goods ultimately are of the same nature. It was only in the early 20 th century that the American economy began this experiment with centralized printing of money; prior to that time paper money consisted exclusively of banknotes issued by individual fi nancial institutions redeemable upon demand by the bank for a tradable good such as gold or silver, as well as drafts agains t personal accounts. Our Federal Reserve scrip of today will not be redeemed by the issuing institution, but is imbued with value by our general agreement as participants in the market to accept it as a trading medium. This distinction does not mitigate its nature as a token symbolizing time/labor. When you are paid dollars by one participating member of the market, you are receiving notes of obligation against the common pool of market wealth equal to your contribution to that pool, and redeemable in the form of any other equally valued portion of the pool. That pool is the aggregate of all the time/labor invested by the participants in that market. The true nature of money is an important issue for society for many reasons, but for our purposes here, it is because those benefiting from already confusing \"income\" tax laws try to further muddy the waters by focusing our attention on the acquisition of money- as though the tax were laid upon money, rather than on taxable (privileged) activities, the extent of which is measured by the money they produce. Such beneficiaries like very much to have the legal object of the \"income\" tax be a blurry moving target in the minds of their 30"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The Supreme Court And The Meaning Of \"Income\" victims, and they are delighted to borrow from the widespread confusion regarding the nature of money. Money, of course, being property, can only be taxed by a direct (therefore, apportioned) tax. Furthermore, it is important to keep in mind that the money itself, particularly our printed scrip form, has no inherent value at all-- its sole value is in its representation of, or ability to command redemption by, labor. You can't eat the money, you can only eat the product of labor for which the money can be traded. When you give someone money, you're actually giving them, at bottom, labor; when you receive money, you are receiving debt instruments representing labor owed to you. In a complex economy, the distance between currency and the foundational labor of acquiring, defending, coaxing yield— and eventually surplus- from the land; and the basic production of all the other things made possible by that fundamental formation of wealth is great indeed, but that labor remains the source of value of every dollar. To summarize all of this in a nutshell: remuneration for work literally IS labor; and the seizure (whether called a tax or anything else) of remuneration that is the result of simply working for a living amounts to slavery. There is no meaningful distinction that can be drawn between the taking of 25% of a worker's pay in taxes with which to purchase [his or his competitor's] products and services, and forcing that worker Into a government factory to produce those products and services for free 2 hours out of every 8-hour workday. That the latter would be grossly unconstitutional needs hardly be said; that the former also is should be clear as well. In light of the requirement that a lawfully taxable activity be measured by profit (without even concerning ourselves with the privilege requirement), it is equally clear that in neither case can \"Income\" be alleged. Just as it is impossible to characterize two 31"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code hours of labor in the government factory as profit, the two hours worth of work taken as money also fails the test. (For someone working for the taxing authority, of course, the \"tax\" would be nothing but a pay cut, and would represent a voluntarily accepted condition of \"employment\", all remuneration from which constitutes, by law, profit). This discussion of labor and money allows an only slightly tortured segue to another topic by virtue of the underlying wisdom awaiting discovery, as so often is the case, behind words long associated wi th those two subjects. In this case, it is our expression \"making money\" that reveals the truth about money's nature; for restated with more accuracy and clarity, what we mean by these words is \"creating wealth\", a true description of our behavior when we expend our labor- wealth being nothing more than the durable product of labor, whether that labor is devoted directly to physical production or improvement, or is in the form of services by which others are made able to so directly produce. The creation, of course, is the property of the creator; by which principle both our own wealth is secured to us, and that created by virtue of government privilege is made amenable to a government claim of an ownership interest. This same principle informs the nature of lawful government and its proper authority, and the laws that can be made under that authority; which we will briefly explore next. While a thoughtful and informed perspective on those subjects is not absolutely necessary to understand and apply the tax law as written, it is nonetheless very helpful in that endeavor-- and a virtue in any free and sovereign citizen. 32"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Regarding The Law And Its Virtues Regarding The Law And Its Virtues A society transforms itself into a state through the adoption of law. By the use of law, what had been more-or-less spontaneous interactions of conflict are regularized and formalized. This more reliably secures to each participant the benefits of predictability and stability (and that of a superior defensive capacity against individuals or organizations which might seek to subjugate them). Law provides these benefits by replacing the vagaries of custom and tradition with demonstrably authorized, wr itten, unambiguous and procedurally scrupulous rules governing the interactions of the participants, backed by the coo perative and coordinated actions of each such participant. When performing its legitimate purpose, the law is a great blessing to all. When carelessness or ignorance permit its application to illegitimate purposes, the enormous power of a coordinated and cooperative society becomes a potent tool for the satisfaction of private interests and the abuse of political targets, as well as the imposition of tyranny. It is possible to measure the character of that whic h claims status as law by its conformity to three essential principles: 1. Legitimacy of 33"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code authority; 2. Clarity of command; and 3. Conformity with established procedures of notice. Though once the very pinnacle of respect for legitimate rule of law (and the most richly rewarded beneficiary thereof), the United States has fallen deeply from that high ground. An analysis of the essential principl es of law will reveal how we have stumbled, and provide guidance as to how to once again find the right path. But first, Sovereignty Before discussing the characteri stics of law, which is the product of a state, it is necessary to briefly comment on sovereigns, who are the precursors to the state. A sovereign is a free-standing, independent agent, whose right to exist and act are inherent by nature. While much weird and degenerate philosophy has been fabricated over the centuries alleging social contracts, mystical fatherlands, divine right and the like, ad nauseum, the simple and incontrovertible facts are: • No human being can assert a claim of authority by right over any other human being; • All human agencies are merely subordinate constructs which can claim no authority beyond that of their creators; furthermore all agencies can assert nothing for themselves and assertions made on their behalf can have no demonstrable standing beyond that of the speaker or speakers, who are just other human beings; • No one can claim more or superior rights to those of any one else. Therefore, regardless of whether or not each of us really has a right to act freely, no one else has a right to interfere with our acting freely. So, we are all sovereign by default at least, if not by design. Our power-to-act is not dependent upon or answerable to any other person or any other person's creation. 34"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Regarding The Law And Its Virtues States, on the other hand, are not sovereign, except as to other states. This will be discussed in more detail below. On to the law... ***** 1. Legitimacy of Authority The starting point of any law is the authority of the legislators. A law can only issue from an agency to which those upon whom the law will act have delegated appropriate authority. Such authority can be broad or narrow, depending upon the wishes of the delegator, but is in all cases limited and explicit-- for the authority to withdraw, modify or define any delegation cannot itself be delegated. A delegation, after all, is an assignment, not a negotiation; furthermore, only that over which an individual has authority himself can be delegated to another. \"Authority\" means creatorship, or, because the attributes of the created are as designed by the creator, the rule of the created by the creator. (The root of the word is the Latin, \"auctor\" which means \"creator\". The principle which is addressed here doesn't rest on semantics, of course, but as is often the case, the etymology of the appropriate term can clear away cobwebs of confusion spun by its promiscuous misuse.) Being possessed of authority over their own decisions, individuals can delegate the making of such decisions to an agent, and can agree to adopt such decisions as their own and act accordingly. The quality of self-directed independence (sovereignty) however, is not under human authority and therefore cannot be delegated to the state. Thus, the state can have no standing or interest on behalf of which its spokesmen may properly dispute, redefine, qualify or interpret the terms of the delegation. The state is not a party to the deal and is, insofar as its own nature is concerned, voiceless. 35"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code It is, after all, the delegation itself which creates the state. The creation cannot partake of the decision by which it is created; that is, the state cannot authorize its own authority. Not only is such a lifting-oneself-up-by-one's-own-bootstraps impossible temporally, it is also impossible legally, for it would create a dysfunctional and irresolvable tension between competing authorities. The creation would argue with the creator, from equal standing, as to what authority has been granted it— the legal equivalent of two bodies occupying the same space at the same time. Further, even if the met aphysical impediments could be overcome, such a delegation could not be accomplished, for it would constitute an unmistakable act against the delegator's own interests, be evidence of an unsoundness of mind, and therefore be void. Basic logic and legal principle establish that one cannot competently or effectively choose to divest oneself of the power to delegate, or to be the sole determinant of the meaning and extent of delegations made, or otherwise compromise one's sovereignty. Simple natural law precludes the possibility as well-- as Samu el Adams, the Father of the American Revolution, points out, \"If men, through fear, fraud, or mistake, should in terms renounce or give up any natural right, the eternal law of reason and the grand end of society would absolutely vacate such renunciation. The right to freedom being the gift of Almigh ty God, it is not in the power of man to alienate this gift and voluntarily become a slave.\" Nor, of course, can one individual be bound by delegative choices made by another. Any individual has only the capacity to delegate his own deliberative and decision-making powers, not those of his neighbor. Although these points about the subordinate, voiceless nature of the state seem elementary upon examination, 36"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Regarding The Law And Its Virtues violations of the principle are now routine in America, in service to factions wishing to exercise illegitimate power for their own benefit at the expense of their neighbors. This is done through a corrupt and corrupting sophistry which twists legitimacy of authority and sovereignty into conveniences of the politically powerful. The process can be perceived by consideration of any victimless \"crime\". Because the relevant behavior involves no conflict in regard to which the participants might have an interest in the benefits of law, no credible or proper basis for a relevant delegation authorizing state involvement can be alleged. Also, of course, no victim with standing from which to seek suppressive redress can be called upon. Factions which wish to nonetheless assert power over their neighbors in regard to the disapproved behavior must overcome these infirmities. To do so, they posit a mysticism by which the aggregate mass of delegators, personified by the state, has, prest-o change-o!, acquired sovereignty-- and sovereignty of superior stature to that of any of it s individual parts. This magical sovereign claims standing as an aggrieved party where no real one can make a complaint, so as to legitimize calling upon itself for remediation from the \"offense\". Godlike, this sovereign exists at all times and in all places, available to be offended against whenever and wherever any vile perpetrator acts, and, being relieved of the necessity of proving personal injury, it admits to no meaningful limit as to the behavior within its reach. Thus the state creates its own authority to act at will, by self- proxy- where no authority to act by delegation exists. Which is to say, those in control of the state's power create- all on their own- new authority under which it will act, doing their will. Partaking of the fiction of the magic sovereign is the philosophically complementary proposition that each and every person within the state's reach can be presumed, whether they acknowledge it or not, to have entered into an unwritten 37"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code contract with it and owe it performance, which notion finds expression in the concepts of duty to the state and offenses of omission. Both are invoked heavily either directly or sub- textually in support of the \"income\" tax scheme that is our present focus, as well as for the justification of much other improper behavior by the state. Another pernicious consequence of this construct is the recent trend toward direct adoption of its principles by various factions, in a bizarre balkanization of the polity into a multitude of magic sovereigns. So-called \"hate crimes\", which amount to the criminalizing of behavior causing no demonstrable harm to any individual but offending the sensibilities of a sub-community of identity- according to its spokespeople- serve as examples. Whether the conduct being targeted (or demanded) through these legal and philosophical contortions is good or bad is not at all the point- the point is the ugliness of narrow political interests adopting the mantle of an imaginary authority backed by all the vast power delegated to the state, for any purpose whatever. 2. Clarity of Command A second essential element of proper law is clarity. Just as the delegation of authority must be explicit, so too must the product of the legislators to whom such delegations have been made. Clearly, no benefits over the soft and fuzzy admonitions of custom and tradition are extended by law which is ambiguous or subjective, or prone to constant interpretation and re- interpretation. Indeed, the entire purpose of law-making is to inform those to whom it applies precisely what is expected of them by others and how those others will formally react to any given behavior. Law which can only be applied with the assistance of interpretation is therefore improper and void- such law not only provides no usable notice of its requirements to those for whose 38"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Regarding The Law And Its Virtues Interests it is purportedly cra fted, but becomes necessarily the law of the interpreter rather than that of the delegatees. While an argument in defense of such free-form law has been advanced, to the effect that those delegatees are merely delegating authority in their turn, this proposition fails. Such delegatees do not have, and cannot delegate, such authority. Their only authority is what has been delegated to them, and they cannot be given the power of self-direction. This is not to say that a delegation could not include the command that under this or that circumstance, and regarding this or that particular, law-making authority will pass to this or that other organ of the state. A command of this sort could even refer to this complication with language such as, \"When such and such is the case, the legislature shall delegate law- making authority to the executive (or the judiciary)\", although it would be an example of poor construction. What is really being said, however (the awkward language notwithstanding), is that when the specified circumstances obtain, the delegators withdraw the delegation from the legislature and grant it to the executive (or whoever) instead. This principle is so elementary and fundamental that it needs no elaborate analysis. The law must mean what it says, and say what it means, or there is no purpose to it whatsoever. We do not establish a legislature, and delegate authority thereto, in order to, in the end, guess at meaning of its products or learn of their requirements and nuances only once charged with their violation and in jeopardy of life, liberty or property. Notably absent from our delegation of authority to the state is any providing that in cases in which the legislature should produce incomprehensible or even simply ambiguous \"law\", authority transfers to the judiciary under which that branch can \"interpret\" and \"clarify\" such flawed enactments. Judges are charged with the responsibility for overseeing the fair and proper enforcement of what the law IS, not of what it SHOULD be, or what they imagine the legislature must have 39"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code meant. That the judiciary is empowered to rule an enactment unconstitutional is not an exception to this truth; such a ruling is no more than a declaration that the enactment in question either fails to provide clarity of command; exceeds delegated authority; or violates the requirements of proper notice (which we shall examine shortly). No law is thus promulgated by those to whom such authority has not been delegated. Sophomoric late-night-dorm-room protestations to the contrary notwithstanding, to say what something isn't does not amount to saying what it is, (which principle applies equally to the saying of what the delegated authority- itself, by the way, also capable of insufficient clarity- isn't). Furthermore, the law must be expressed such that each participant can understand its requirements and nuances for themselves. No member of a society can properly be subject to the risks of being on the losing end of a conflict of interest with an interpreter, or be obliged to trade with an industry of translators in order to have explained what has been done with their own delegation of authority! The principle of rational self- interest precludes the legitimacy of such legislation, as much as does that of primary authority. That proper law is thus necessarily limited in both its scope and its depth is a facet of an elegant dynamic favoring the minimalist state. There will, of course, always be some members of a society who cannot (or will not) comprehend some laws crafted by the associated state. Such persons cannot be viewed as having given their consent for those laws. They must be viewed as outside such laws. To the degree that such laws address transgressions against other members of society, non- consentors can be subject to thei r restraint- the authority of self-defense thus exercised by those other members is unalienable and itself precedential to the state- but cooperation with requirements-to-act (all versions of which amount to acts in support of the state), cannot properly be expected of them. No 40"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Regarding The Law And Its Virtues one can be legitimately enslaved to the interests of others, however untidy such a prohibition may seem. The practical application of this is that, once again, the state must remain small and simple. Despite the obviousness of the principle of clarity of command, courtrooms across the United States are filled with defendants- rich and poor alike— being made to answer to a \"law\" which in many cases specif ically excludes them from its ambit, but is deliberately written so as to encourage misunderstanding of this fact. Even more victims are held to account for requirements allegedly to be found among the incomprehensible hundreds of thousands of words of which many \"laws\", crafted to serve po litical rather than societal purposes, are made— words which neither the judges, prosecutors, or defense attorneys could make even a credible pretense of having actually read. 3. Conformity to Established Procedures of Notice The third pillar of legal propriety concerns the means by which the requirements of the law are made known to those on whom they will have effect. The legal cliche that, \"Ignorance of the law is no excuse\" can be true enough, but only where proper law prevails. Ignorance of a law passed in secret, or ambiguously crafted, is a complete and perfect excuse. No one can be held to account for a law the existence, meaning, or authority of which is kept from them, or is otherwise unavailable. Thus it is an essential principle that a consistent and effective means of notice be established and deployed. As in all else regarding the law, ambiguity cannot be tolerated as to notice. A legitimate state will institute, and scrupulously abide by, explicit and well publicized rules for the construction, language, and dissemination of the law. (Indeed, no less than as regards clarity of meaning, a failure to do so 41"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code must be viewed as an attempt to create a favored class within the greater host of participants, equipped with knowledge to be ransomed to their fellows.) Laxness, even in the case of law related to the simplest and most common-sense behavior for which long and deeply established bodies of custom and tradition might exist, is unjustified and unacceptable. The necessity of rigid conformity to rules regarding form and notice is still more essential for statutes not enjoying such universal and instinctive embrace. The very pinnacle of the importance of this principle attends statutes purporting to require positive action, as opposed to restraint. Such requirements are not natural to human interaction, and, unlike those imposing restraint, they involve no other interactive member whose competing interests an actor's behavior directly affects and who could therefore play a role in the notice process. (Restraints on purely private individual behavior are not under consideration here; they are all illegitimate.) The associated complications are undesirable, and fertile ground for misunderstanding and the development of intricate-- and therefore error-prone- case law. Thus, it bears repeating: requirements of positive action under the law must be most scrupulously clear in authority, construction and notice. The importance of respect for this principle, particularly as regards the element of clarity, can be illust rated by a look at America today. The mechanisms of proper form and notice are diligently provided for in the Amer ican legal structure, including two key elements in the United States Code: Title 1, Chapter 2, Section 101- Enacting Clause: \"The enacting clause of all Acts of Congress shall be in the following form: \"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.'\" and, 42"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Regarding The Law And Its Virtues Title 5, Part 1, Chapter 5, Subchapter 2, Section 552- Public information; agency rules, opinions, orders, records, and proceedings: \"(a) Each agency shall make available to the public information as follows: (1)(D) substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized by law, and statements of general policy or interpretations of general applicability formulated and adopted by the agency;\" The US House of Representatives' Office of the Law Revision Counsel observes that of the 50 ti tles in the US Code, only 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 23, 28, 31, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 44, 46, and 49 have been enacted as positive law, leaving a 27 title majority both un-enacted, and often lacking published rules for significant sections. Nonetheless, federal workers issue forth from high-rise fortresses throughout the country every morning to browbeat fines, plea bargains and concessions from citizens based upon those 27 titles, which consist largely of congressional declarations and executive orders, rather than statutes with general applicability. (At best, mere portions of t hose titles are distorted reflections of older actual statutes). The fact is, those un-enacted titles are intermingled with the others, and within each type are intermingled in turn general statutes and the far more limited declarations and executive orders mentioned abov e, which only have application to federal entities or within feder al territorial jurisdiction. This intermingling makes distinguishing each from the other extremely difficult— effectively neutralizing the benefits of form and notice and leaving most Americans unable to challenge or resist illegitimate assertions of federal authority. The resultant passing of practical power from the citizenry to the state, by default rather than by consent, makes manifest the importance of respect for all the requirements of proper form and notice. 43"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code The chief object of the lawful state is to ensure domestic tranquility— the kind of tranquility which results from the countless conflicts of a free and energetic society having reliable access to an impartial system of resolution and remedy.

It is sheer, resting lightly upon all; and it is flexible, being constructed of values shared by the widest possible divergence of interests. It is as resilient as the laws of nature upon which it is based; and it is as beautiful as the aspirations of individual happiness cherished by each of those it protects.

If they say what they mean and mean what they say; are comprehensible without reliance on assumptions and inferences; and claim no authority not lawfully available, then they are lawful. If they do not mean what they say, or do not say what they mean, or claim authority not lawfully available, then they are unlawful, and void. \"The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute, though having the form and name of law, is in reality no law, but is wholly void and ineffective for any purpose, 44"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Regarding The Law And Its Virtues since its unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment...In legal contemplation, it is as inoperative as if it had never been passed...

As we proceed with that study, we can be guided by the example of the Supreme Court in the landmark Brushaber decision and approach the statutes and code in light of what they CAN say and do, in order to understand what they DO say and do. Remember that to the degree a statute is held to have meanings not clearly stated, it is unlawful-- both by violation of the requirements of proper notice and construction, and because the effect of such inferences (as typically manifested) would exceed lawful available authority.

Doubtless the language in the section excerpted above led some of those new to the subject to presume that it purported to tax the compensation received by persons not listed within the parentheses as well as those who are. Such persons probably took it upon themselves to assess as taxable their own exempt private-sector and unprivileged compensation, and sent in a c heck to the treasury. (Happily, any confusion was not incredibly widespread. In a 1941 report titled \"Collection at Source of the Individual Normal Income Tax\", the Treasury Department's Division of Tax Research noted that, \"For 1936, taxable income tax returns filed represented only 3.9% of the population.\", which percentage would have included all regular federal workers, PWA workers, license-holders, etc., along with any misled private persons.

That in estimating the gains, profits and income of any person there shall be included...aII other gains, profits, and income derived from any source whatever except that portion of the salary, compensation, or pay received for services in the civil, military, naval, or other se rvice of the United States, including Senators, Representatives, and Delegates in Congress, from which t he tax has been deducted\"... \"And provided further, That in cases where the salary or other compensation paid to any person in the employment or service of the United States shall not exceed the rate of four thousand dollars per annum, or shall be by fees, or uncertain or irregular in the amount or in the time during which the same shall have accrued or been earned, such salary or other compensation shall be included in estimating the annual gains, 48"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The Plot Thickens profits or income of the person to whom the same shall have been paid, and shall include that portion of any income or salary upon which a tax has not been paid by the employer, where the employer is required by law to pay on the excess over four thousand dollars; (Such withholding from the pay of government workers over four thousand dollars is provided for further on in the act). In this construction, again just as in the 1862 act, the \"gains, profits and income derived from any source\" by any person are to be included in estimating their total annual \"gains, profits and income\", but the compensation of federal workers is specifically identified as being itself included in the meaning of those words. The portion below $4000 is to be listed as \"income\" and self-assessed; that above $4000 is taxed at the source through withholding. The \"compensation\", etc., of private persons is clearly excluded by omission. Look again at the 1921 version: Gross Income Defined: Section 213. That for the purposes of this title (except as otherwise provided in section 233 [Gross Income Of Corporations Defined -PH]) the term gross income- (a) includes gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, and compensation for personal service (including in the case of the President of the United States, the judges of the Supreme and inferior courts of the United States, and all other officers and employees, whether elected or appointed, of the United States, Alaska, Hawaii, or any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, the compensation received as such)... or all gains, profits and income derived from any source whatever.\" The only difference between the two is the misleading (and otherwise pointless) deliberate mention of unspecified \"salaries, wages and compensation for personal service\" as 49"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code something from which \"gains, profits and income\" might be derived in the language of the 1921 act.

There is no difference in the meaning of the two sections. By 1928 Congress abandons even the rudimentary and convoluted- but still overt- acknowledgements in the earlier acts, leaving entirely to the reader's knowledge of the law the distinction between the privileged, taxable compensation for services of government workers and that of unprivileged private-sector workers. The distin ction still existed, of course- the nature of the tax, and its limitations, were unchanged- but there is no legal requirement to spell it out any more clearly.

Although the Classification Act of 1923 was repealed in 1949, its qualifying effect was incorporated into the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, which is nothing more than a representation of such statutes (as we will discuss thoroughly in a little while). This effect carried over into the IRC's of 1954 and 1986 Insofar as they merely restate re levant elements incorporated in the 1939 version. It is particularly important in the modern Section 61, 'Gross Income Defined', wherein \"compensation for services\"\\s listed as a specific \"item of income\" and its misleadingly ambiguous distinction from '\"income \"derived', seen in the 1921 version, is restored.

Utah, 221 U.S. 452, at 455, 466. I mentioned in the foreword to this book that for decades efforts to mis-apply the income tax to receipts connected with private-sector activities have capitalized upon the widespread presumption that despite no one ever seeing it, some portion of the law must explicitly impose the tax upon them. Any who have questioned this presumption have been treated by defenders of the scheme to a little maze of circular arguments revolving around the term \"includes\", of which we will see a great deal as we move forward into examination of the nuts- and-bolts of the \"income\" tax laws. The real essence of this effort is to wear down the questioner; it offers nothing but suggested implications about other parts of the law to answer that fatal central doubt, but it is the best the schemers can do. The principles discussed earlier in 'Regarding the Law and Its Virtues' should make addressing this nonsense unnecessary; however, it must be acknowledged that the construction of the relevant portions of the law combines sufficiently with a lifelong misinformation campaign regarding this subject to nurture a somewh at forgivable uncertainty in some. This is particularly true in light of the bellicose demeanor of those who benefit from that doubt- it is a natural human reaction to seize upon, and not examine too closely, an even marginally plausible justificati on for declining to confront a snarling, rabid animal such as the IRS. 55"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code Here is the dodge: The tax laws very studiously and deliberately deploy terms with unique, custom definitions, such as \"employee\", \"trade or business\" and \"United States\". That these terms mimic normal words is itself confusing, and would itself be sufficient to quiet many objectors, particularly those who never go so far as to discover their custom-definitions (which is to say, most). At this level, inquiry ceases when confronted with, for instance, \"The law says \"everyone engaged in a trade or business shall...\". Deeper inquiry, by which the custom meaning of key terms is revealed, is more prob lematic to the tax scheme, but those clarifying definitions have themselves an obfuscating element seized upon by its beneficiaries. Whether by craft or simple bureaucratic awkwardness, many of these definitions incorporate the term \"includes\", as in (26) Trade or business: The term \"trade or business\" includes the performance of the functions of a public office. At this level of inquiry the skeptical are encouraged to believe that by the provision of \"includes\" things not specifically named in the custom definition are incorporated within its meaning as well, by implication. Finally, in the face of a refusal to accept the imposition of law to \"implied\" subjects, the beneficiaries of the scheme roll out mirrors to supplement the smoke and direct the insistent doubter's attention to the custom definition of \"includes\" provided within the code (in section 7701(c)): \"Includes and including: The terms \"includes\" and \"including\" when used in a definition contained in this title shall not be deemed to exclude other things otherwise within the meaning of the term defined.\" This is the eight-hundred-pound gorilla of obfuscation available to the \"income\" tax sche mers. By presenting it within the context described, it is meant to suggest a sort of legal foundation for the imposition of the law by implication rather than specification. Really, as used, it's just an elaborate formulation of the age-old legal maxim, \"Because I said so!\" The intended misunderstanding of the section is that terms 56"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Law Means What It Says defined as \"xx includes... \"embrace all things commonly meant by the word being custom re-defined plus those things listed after \"includes\"-- but again, merely by implication. Happily, this effort to muddy the waters quickly fails under analysis. As we are about to delve into the morass of these mis-directions, it behooves us to undertake that exercise. (There may be some who will feel that I devote more attention to this one little word than seems reasonable. However, in light of the fact that all but a truly rarefied few private-sector persons have lost possession of at least 15% of their earnings each and every working year of their lives the diversion of which has been justified solely by a cunning misconstruction of this little wo rd, I respectfully disagree.) To start with, we must recognize that if a word is meant to be understood as having its common meaning, there is no need to define it at all. It is axiomatic that if a word is explicitly defined, it has a restricted meaning. If language such as, \"For purposes of this paragraph, the term \"Fruit\" includes apples, pears, and oranges, \"is used, it can only be understood as restricting the definition to those things listed, or no definition would be required; the word \"fruit\" would be understood to include apples, pears and oranges, as well as all other fruits. Second, note that the word \"common\"(or its equivalent) is left out of the definition of \"includes\" and \"including\", creating a sophomoric circular argument. The only \"other things otherwise within the meaning of the term defined\" are those that are the same as those used to provide the definition. In other words, the \"things\" used in the definition are what establish the class to which the \"other things\" must belong in order to be included under the doctrine of 7701(c), and, as the word is being deliberately defined, the common meaning of the word must be excluded. 57"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code To see what I mean, insert the word \"common\" as follows: \"The terms \"includes\" and \"inc luding\" when used in a definition contained in this title shall not be deemed to exclude other things otherwise with the common meaning of the term defined.\". Without it, the section is meaningless, but misleading, as intended; and furthermore, note that the statute says, \"...the meaning of the term defined. \", rather than the word defined. If Congress had meant (and been Constitutionally able) to embrace within its definitions the common meaning of the words being made into legal terms it would have written 7701(c) in that way: \"The terms \"includes\" and \"including\" when used in a definition contained in this title shall not be deemed to exclude other things otherwise within the common meaning of the word defined.\" The word isn't a term until the provided definition has been applied, at which point its common meaning has been stripped away. Properly understood, 7701(c) should be read, \"Includes and including: The terms \"includes\" and \"including\" when used in a definition contained in this title shall not be deemed to exclude other things otherwise within the meaning of the term as defined.\" Indeed, at one time there was a regulatory clarification of the 7701(c) definition of \"includes\" which clearly embraced these facts (unsurprisingly long since deleted and not replaced): 26 CFR 170.59- Meaning of Terms: The terms \"includes and including\" do not exclude things not enumerated which are in the same general class. The accuracy of these points is established by more than simple logic and the inadvertent forthrightness of a one- time bureaucrat (doubtless fired for his blunder). Ask yourself this: If \"Fruit\" is defined as, \"When used in this paragraph, the term \"Fruit\" includes turnips, carrots and broccoli.\" is it to be presumed that the term also means apples? How about if in the next paragraph one finds, \"For purposes of this paragraph the 58"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The Law Means What It Says term \"Fruit\" includes apples, turnips, carrots and broccoli.\" Should it be presumed that appl es was included by implication in the first definition and the writer was just lazy, or ran out of typewriter ribbon? Obviously not.

But he did not.) The United States Supreme Court put it this way: \"This fact only underscores our duty to refrain from reading a phrase into the statute when Congress has left it out. \" '[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another..., it is generally pres umed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.

These sections read as follows: • 3401(c) Employee For purposes of this chapter, the term \"employee\" includes an officer, employee, or elected official of the . United States, a State, or any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing.

Now, keeping in mind the declaration by the Supreme Court in Russello and our logical analysis, look at the following definitions in the U.S code which are not relied upon to mislead (at least not for the same purposes or in the same way as their counterparts which are the subjects of our discussion), and recognize that when Congress means to include the private- sector it clearly says so: Title 26 Subtitle C, Chapter 21, Subchapter C, Section 3121: (FICA Income Tax) (NOTE- application of this tax is based upon citizenship and residency, not on being an \"employee\" as such) Employee For purposes of this chapter, the term \"employee\" means - (1) any officer of a corporation; or (2) any individual who, under the usual common law rules applicable in determining the employer-employee relationship, has the status of an employee; and, Title 26, Subtitle D, Chapt er 38, Subchapter A, Sec. 4612.

Clearly, even if one were to be extraordinarily generous in an interpretation of 7701(c)'s definition of \"includes and including\" and treat its meaning as being the same as the old regulatory clarification to which I previously referred, (and which, by the way, is still in use in the regulations for Title 27, at 27 CFR 72.11): Meaning of Terms: The terms \"includes and including\" do not exclude things not enumerated which are in the same general class. the best that could be claimed in favor of the government's preferred characterization of our key terms is that \"employee\" in Section 3401 be understood to include other federal workers whose descriptions are not specifically listed (and \"employer\" the agencies for which they work); and that \"United States\" in 3121 be understood to include other federal territories and possessions similarly left off the enumerated list. Finally, though it is irrelevant to the logical analysis of section 7701(c) (and the other sections to which its definition applies)-- except insofar as to underscore its meaninglessness- saying that something shall not be deemed to be exc/uded does not mean that it must or should be deemed to be included, regardless of how it is defined or classified, or whether necessary referents are provided.

That it did not must be given proper significance. As the United States Supreme Court observed, \"The construction of a statut e by those charged with its execution should be followed unless there are compelling indications that it is wrong, especially when Congress has refused to alter the administrative construction, and such deference is particularly appropriate where an agency's interpretation involves issues of considerable public controversy and Congress has not acted to correct any misperception of its statutory objectives.\" 'CBS, INC. v FCC, 453 US 367 (1981) The existing language has been on the books for 64 years and Congress has revised the code a few hundred times during that period.

This proposition might have a little hang time if the relevant references were found in an addendum or supplement (and if it could be credibly asserted that anyone would otherwise have doubted that, for instance, the guy sorting mail at the Senate Office Building is an employee within the common meaning of the word), but not when they constitute the sole definition of the term.

The simple tawdry fact is that Congress wants to spend lots of your money, and even though it can't seize it from you legally, they are perfectly willing to set up a system by which you are led to believe that they can, and about which you will have great difficulty discovering the truth. Dwell on this a while and the nuances of the phrase 'voluntary compliance' will suddenly become clear. What it refers to is you \"voluntarily\" allowing yourself to be characterized as a recipient of public- sector privilege, and then complying with requirements that attach to that status. From about this point on, we're going to be reading a fair bit of the Internal Revenue Code. As we do, ask yourself, \"Why is it written like this?

It was mostly just a compilation of all revenue acts then in force. Any changes in the language of those earlier acts resulting from that compiling (which were myriad) were not enacted into law. Consequently, except where subsequent formal enactments have explicitly amended or otherwise modified language found therein, such language is subordinate to the older, original laws. This is very significant, because in constructing the code (and the revised code of 1954, and that of 1986) the best that can be said is that a game of post-office is being played, with each reiteration of the original and still dominant law becoming less accurate in its communication of that law. A less charitable view would imagine this process to be deliberate. The misleading disconnectedness from the actual requirements of the law becomes even more pronounced in the regulations associated with each code.

The \"definition of gross income\" section of the 1939 compilation was drawn from the 1938 act, and read as follows: Section 22(a): Gross income includes gains, profits, and income derived from salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service, of 69"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code whatever kind and in whatever form paid, or from professions, vocations, trades, businesses, commerce, or sales, or dealings in property, whether real or personal; also from interest, rent, individuals, securities, or the transaction of any business carried on for gains or profits, or gains or profits from any source whatever. Two months after the release of the code, the Public Salary Tax Act of 1939 was enacted — extending application of the \"income\" tax to the government workers of U.S. possessions and providing, among other things, for reciprocal taxation of federal, District of Columbia, and U.S. possessions government employees by each respective institution. The new act contained the following element: SECTION 1. Section 22 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to the definition of \"gross income\") is amended by inserting after the words \"compensation for personal service\" the following: (\"including personal service as an officer or employee of a State, or any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of the foregoing). (Needless to say, the federal government has no authority to subject officers and employees of the several union States to taxation by decree. In fact, such a thing is explicitly prohibited as a violation of sovereignty. The key to this puzzle is section 7701, at which we looked a bit in The Law Means What It Says'. There we find the sometimes startlingly contrary-to-common-usage definitions of many of the custom terms found throughout the code.

Those still unconvinced that everything they have previously been led to believe about the \"income\" tax is wrong should be very troubled by the Public Salary Tax Act. After all, if everybody's pay amounts to part of the \"gains profits, and income\" 'upon which tax must be paid, then that of \"an officer or employee of a State, or any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of the foregoing\" was already covered by earlier \"any person \"and \"...from whatever source derived\" language before they were added to the list by the act, making that part of it pointless... right?

Today's version of section 22(a) has dropped the explicit reference to the workers added in the Public Salary Tax Act as no longer needing to be restated, just as the 1928 and subsequent acts stopped mentioning federal officers and employees and District of Columbia workers: Sec. 61. - Gross income defined (a) General definition Except as otherwise provided in this subtitle, gross income means all income from whatever source derived, including (but not limited to) the following items: (1) Compensation for services, including fees, commissions, fringe benefits, and similar items; The doctrine is simple and standard in statutory construction: when an element of a statute has once been promulgated, it remains the law, whether spelled out in a future version or not, unless explicitly repealed. However, the distinction of the pay, in particular, of federal, D.C. and \"State\" government workers as being- unlike private-sector workers- of the character of \"gains, profits, and income\" is still exhibited clearly in the withholding provisions of the revenue law. Those provisions, having been rearranged, and amended per section 1 of the Public Salary Tax Act, reappeared in section 466 of the Revenue Act of 1942 in the form we know today, and then were relocated again in the IRC of 1954 to their present resting place in Subtitle C. 72"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Withholding The Truth Withholding The Truth By the time the Current Tax Payment Act of 1943 reiterated the withholding-from-pay provisions first spelled out in the Act of 1862 (and expanded their application to \"State\" workers, per the Public Salary Tax Act), the people writing these acts had become very accustomed to living large, and had a good handle on how their bread was being buttered. They had learned that ambiguities in the language of tax statutes combined productively (from their viewpoint) with a general weakness in legal literacy among the lay population. It had also not escaped their attention that the lawyers and other specialists upon whom most of that lay population, business owners included, relied for expertise were making good livings dishing it out solely due to the complexity of the code.

But even if \"trust accounts\" were really intended to be a formal part of the scheme, they were dropped early.

This language was added to the code after an appellate court ruled, in a suit brought by a stockholder trying to stop a railroad from paying the tax, that no group (current workers) could be taxed to provide benefits (trust account financing) to any other group (retirees). In the subsequent Supreme Court hearing, in which that issue and a challenge of the program's taxes as direct yet unapportioned were considered, the government declined to defend the \"trust account\" concept. Instead, it argued that the \"accounts\" were a fiction; and pointed out that the taxes were excises. (No effort was made to suggest that the 'direct tax' challenge was moot due to the Sixteenth Amendment- the gover nment knew better.)

Remember from the beginning of this section that the tax is imposed on the \"self-employment income\"... which term is later (in a whole different section of the law) defined as actually being the \"net earnings from self- employment\"... which term had been custom-defined itself earlier in the section as the \"gross income derived by an individual from any trade or business\".. which term is itself custom-defined a few hundred thousand words later in the code...

It is worthwhile, I think, to summarize the key points that we have covered so far regarding the nature of the tax: The Constitution prohibits capitations and other direct taxes without apportionment.

Objects proper to an \"income\" excise are privileges- which is to say, acti vities not of common right-- and even then only to the extent that such activities are profitable and properly fall under the taxing authority's jurisdiction. Consequently, the only lawful object of the \"income\" tax is activity for which one is pa id by the federal government; activity effectively connected with the performance of the functions of a public office, such as being an officer of a federal court; activity as a federal, federal instrumentality, or federally chartered \"State\" worker; or acti vity as a paid officer of a federal corporation, such as those on this not necessarily comprehensive list: • the Central Bank for Cooperatives, • the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, • the Federal Home Loan Banks, • the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, • the Federal Land Banks, • the National Credit Union Administration Central Liquidity Facility, • the Regional Banks for Cooperatives, • the Rural Telephone Bank, • the Financing Corporation; • the Resolution Trust Corporation; • the Resolution Funding Corporation; • the Commodity Credit Corporation; • the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, • the Export-Import Bank of the United States, • the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation; 88 "},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"• Federal Prison Industries, Inc.; • the Corporation for National and Community Service, • the Government National Mortgage Association; • the Overseas Private In vestment Corporation; • the Pennsylvania A venue Development Corporation; • the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation; • the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation; • the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Panama Canal Commission; and • the Alternative Agricultural Research and Commercialization Corporation.

(The convention is meaningless as far as how much tax is paid, but it contributes to the scheme by producing the appearance that the law lays a tax on the receipt of money). The total amount of \"income\" measured, by the way, is characterized as \"gross income\" within the revenue statutes.

What is left is that what I say about the law is true, and the apparent contradiction with the ways things are is the consequence of a conspiracy in defiance of that truth. Such a conspiracy might be imagined as one in which judges, prosecutors, bureaucrats, politicians and professionals- knowing the truth- simply act in blithe and blatant disregard of the law as written and ruled upon. They want the money and don't give a damn what the law says, and somehow nobody else knows or cares. This is the \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" scenario.

However, the two conmen, through sheer audacity and an exploitation of the human psychology, oblige each such officer to conclude, or at least presume, that the imaginary clothes which the pair claim to be sewing (while really just engaging in pantomime) are visible to every one but himself. The scheme is sublime. An expansive and eloquent sincerity in presenting the non-existent work for inspection is coupled with the assertion that only those unfit for high station could fail to see the wonderful new raiment-- precluding those who might be inclined to believe their own eyes from voicing, or even seriously entertaining, their doubts. Quite the contrary, in fact: each victim of the scam is seduced into personal participation, vociferously praising the magnificence of the work, so as to not be thought unfit, and encouraging their fellows to do the same while marginalizing the unenthusiastic. The cunning process instantly created a community of interest in the perpetuation- even the elaboration- of the illusion. So, the fantasy is spun and continues, not only unchallenged but ever- fed, until the Emperor himself, having been told over and over by all of his subordinates what wonderful work the conmen are doing (and, no less than any ot her, unwilling to raise doubts regarding his own fitness for office), effusively praises the invisible garments with which he is at last fitted, and marches naked into the public square to show off his new finery.

The inconvenience attendant upon scrupulous respect for the rights of our neighbor, including his right to his property and the fruits of his labor, is the price we pay for civilization. It may well be true that a certain amount of taxation is practically unavoidable. (It may well not be true either— but I am not seeking to make that case in this book). However, we are provided with Constitutional forms for the practice that are not only adequate to any legitimate national need, but are at the same time protective of the liberty which is, after all, the only reason for which the state and its taxing powers have been instituted. We have already discussed direct taxation under the Constitution, and why the Founders opposed them in principle and instituted hobbling safeguards by which to ensure against abuse. Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist #21, provides a useful little summary of the principles of the alternative provided, indirect taxes, for which only the rule of uniformity is necessary: \"Imposts, excises, and, in general, all duties upon articles of consumption, may be compared to a fluid, which will, in time, find its level with the means of paying them. The amount to be contributed by each citizen will in a degree be at his own option, and can be regulated by an attention to his resources. The rich may be extravagant, the poor can be frugal; and private oppression may always be avoided by a judicious selection of objects proper for such impositions. If inequalities should arise in some States from duties on particular objects, these will, in all probability, be counterbalanced by proportional inequalities in other States, from the duties on other objects.

Or, if inequalities should still exist, they would neither be so great in their degree, so uniform in their operation, nor so odious in their appearance, as those which would necessarily spring from quotas, upon any scale that can possibly be devised. It is a signal advantage of taxes on articles of consumption, that they contain in their own nature a security against excess. They prescribe their own limit; which cannot be exceeded without defeating the end proposed, that is, an extension of the revenue. When applied to this object, the saying is as just as it is witty, that, \"in political arithmetic, two and two do not always make four\". If duties are too high, they lessen the consumption; the collection is eluded; and the product to the treasury is not so great as when they are confined within proper and moderate bounds. This forms a complete barrier against any material oppression of the citizens by taxes of this class, and is itself a natural limitation of the power of imposing them.\" The uniformity rule, though previously argued as meaning \"If the sale of a widget carries a $10 tax in Idaho, then it must also carry a $10 tax in Vermont\", is better understood today. Modern scholarship— and simple clear-headedness— is revealing that the \"uniformity\" requirement is intended to ensure that the distribution of taxes, region by region, is as uniform as it could be made. In other words, it is to ensure that the federal government cannot impose a tax in connection with an item used only, or far more commonly, in any particular region which would thus bear a disproportionate share of the burden of maintaining the national government.

(The requirement of equal treatment under the law sees to the other kind of uniformity). Sadly, the virtue or purpose of this principle, which is intended for application to tariffs as well as internal indirect taxes, was disregarded during the mid 19 th century. The Northern States, which, being more populous, dominated Congress, saw to the enactment of tariffs protective of their well-established and politically active manufacturing interests. Southern States, whose econom ies were based on exports and who were importers of the tari ff-affected goods became wildly disproportionate net-tax-paying States compared to the North. By 1858, the South was paying 87% of the total tariff. This situation strongly influenced the decision by the South to secede, resulting in the War Between the States.

Such myths supplemented and gradually repl aced the massive violence of the original conquest by arms as the means of the collection from the subject population of tribute-- the original word for \"taxes\". This transformational process was a consequence of the conquerors and the subject population's blending together, with the outright master-slave relationship being softened somewhat by the development of traditions, ritual, etc. Now we have the situation in reverse, in which a tribute-claiming (or, at least, consuming) class is forming and detaching itself from the larger population, with barely a peep from citizens who wouldn't hesitate to throw a fit if the groc er tried to overcharge them by a nickel. 102"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Interlude It may yet be a bit early to start teaching your children how to curtsey and bow; but unless wealth-producers and those who love liberty assert themselves, in due course they'll need such skills.

Being unable to declare private-sector, unprivileged activities to be subject to the ta x, or to- itself- declare that a private-sector individual engaged in taxable activities, the government instead attempts to cause private-sector individuals to legally declare- for themselves- that payments with which they are associated involved taxable activities. This is accomplished by inducing such persons to erroneously, and sometimes criminally, issue affirmations about themselves and others- under oath and penalty of perjury- to the effect that their payments or receipts occurred as government workers, in connection with the performance of a public office, or while resident in an area under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government, such as the District of Columbia. 108"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"\"W\" Is For Weapon Although in this respect the scheme is constructively fraudulent, it is implemented with careful attention to not crossing the line beyond which explicit criminal culpability of the government and its actors arises.

At the same time, though the victims whose wealth is the target of the flim-flam are themselves tricked into enabling the processes brought to bear against them, the law as written imposes no requirement to do so. This is what is meant by \"voluntary compliance\" with the income tax- citizens under no obligation to do so voluntarily participate in, or leave unchal lenged, the processes by which their untaxable receipts are transformed into taxable benefits of privilege. \"Let me point this out now.

Now, here is the definition of a \"withholding agent\" and the titles of the sections to which that definition refers: Title 26, Section 7701 (16) Withholding agent The term \"withholding agent\" means any person required to deduct and withhold any tax under the provisions of section 1441, 1442, 1443, or 1461. Section 1441- Withholding of tax on nonresident aliens Section 1442- Withholding of tax on foreign corporations Section 1443- Foreign tax-exempt organizations Section 1461- Liability for withheld tax Section 1461 is the only place in Subtitle A of the IRC where anyone is 'made liable' for a tax, by the way-- here it is in its entirety: Sec. 1461. - Liability for withheld tax Every person required to deduct and withhold any tax under this chapter [Chapter 3 - Withholding of tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Corporations -PH] is hereby made liable for such tax and is hereby indemnified against the claims and demands of any person for the amount of any payments made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter So the only entities whose numbers are required to be included on anyone else's return (1099, etc.), and which therefore can be demanded, are three categories of foreign persons connected with a \"United States\" presence, \"trade or business\", or tax treaty; and one group of \"nonresident aliens\" electing*, by virtue of the provision in section 6013 (g) and (h), to be technically characteriz ed as \"resident aliens\", and 126"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"W-9's And Other Alien Notions therefore \"U.S. persons\". And, in all cases, only insofar as any of those entities have been paid 'income' by the filer, which is the starting point for the production of any information return. *The reason for the election is because the relevant law regarding nonresident aliens, primarily that enacted as sections 29 and 31 of the Revenue Act of 1894 and re-enacted as section 215(a) in the Revenue Act of 1928, provides that those so electing are entitled to the personal exemption available in the law for residents- if they produce a return as though a resident and identify all \"income\" whether from sources within or without the \"United States\". This protocol also limits the tax to the \"income\" from sources \"within the United States\". For the record, banks ARE required to REQUEST a number from people opening new accounts, under 31 CFR 103.34, but not for purposes of making a return; and they are considered in compliance with the all related requirements even if they don't get one, as long as they asked. Also for the record, they will usually make their request as, \"We are required to ask you to execute this instrument\", accurately enough. They generally won't inform their correspondent that he or she is not required to comply. The many other persons who routinely demand the execution of one of these instruments from contractors and investors haven't even that regulatory excuse- they have simply been misled to believe that they are 'required' just because they are paying someone money. However, as we have just determined, a number must only be furnished when requested by someone who is required to file a return-- which can only be in regard to a payment of \"income\", and then only when such a payment is made to a particular sort of person. A great deal would seem to be being asked of a payer.

On the other hand is the risk associat ed with the liability imposed by section 1461 if they make a bad call the other way. How is the payer to know that they are paying \"income\" (or, if you prefer, the \"taxable interest, dividend, and certain other payments\" identified in the form's Privacy Act notice)? Remember, the Supreme Court has unambiguously instructed us that \"income\" is not to be defined as \"all that comes in\"; and it's not defined at all in the code... Think back to the statutes and regulations establishing the requirements for the filings of returns which we examined in 'Crafting A Trade Or Business Plan...' and '\"W\" Is For Weapon' (there are a few others as well, all of precisely the same character). Recall that there is a common thread running through them: They adhere exclusively to payments made consequent to \"the performance of the functions of a public office \"(\"trade or business\") or of federal territorial or instrumentality origin. Now it makes sense. The requisite knowledge supporting the legitimate requester's assertions is that of their own status, involving no guesswork or risk- because the legitimate requester is an agent of the federal government. Only an agent of the federal government, or payer operating under the federal government's special jurisdiction, is required to file a return- and by virtue of the same qualification, payments made from such a source are \"income\", and are not challengeable by the payee.

Similarly, if one provides an identifying number which only need be supplied by someone about whom an information return must be filed, one is also adopting a particular legal status for onesel f and/or one's receipts-- a status that is quite rarified in its proper application, as we have just seen. In both cases, any related activities or receipts, all of which may actually be of a purely unprivileged (and thus untaxable) character, are legally colored as being taxable- either as the consequence of privilege or of jurisdictional infirmity. Establishing support for these presumptions is one of the main purposes behind the scheme's encouragement of private parties utterly unconnect ed with any \"trade or business\", and banks, to induce the submission of W-9's. I suspect that the primary reason for promoting the use of these forms, though, is simply to induce persons who haven't already done so to get numbers and thus announce themselves to the scheme; and to establish documentation that they are a \"U.S. person\". Once this is d one, a rationale is created for treating them as subject to the code, and, more importantly, such status will subsequently be used against those that THEY pay, in turn, as being beneficiaries of privilege. It will be relied upon in the future to justify treating the receipts and payments of both as \"income\". One who is not a \"U.S. person\", but is facing stubborn insistence that a W-9 be submitted, could, perhaps, consider complying— after replacing the relevant line with an accurate declaration, like: \"I am a Pennsy lvania citizen\" (or whatever is true); and adding language such as: \"I have submitted this instrument solely to declare my belief that payments made to the named entity are not subject to withholding.

But the better course is equally stubborn insistence on lawful treatment, informed by the certain knowledge that compliance as regards a W-9-- or any other legal instrument- cannot actually be required 'under any circumstances.

He owes no duty to the state or to his neighbors to divulge his business, or to open his doors to an investigation, so far as it may tend to criminate him. He owes no such duty to the state, since he receives nothing therefrom, beyond the protection of his life and property.

Understand clearly that this is the character of that last element of the penalty notice. It is making false claims of payments made to the listed person, not payments made on behalf of ' that person that are addressed here. In other words, this notice refers to the filing of a form by a company claiming to have paid \"wages as defined in 3401 or 3121\" or \"gains, profits or income\" in the course of a \"trade or business\" to a person when in fact they did not. A company making false claims regarding how much tax they withheld and paid to the IRS on behalf of someone answers to the government for the mistake by way of the other penalties listed above (and possibly for perjury as well).

This is not to say that the tax-collection engine is complacent, of course. Substantial and sophisticated measures are taken to support the errors of understanding which contribute to the process.

The most egregious and pernicious example of this is the Form 688-W Notice of Levy by which the agency seeks to co-opt a company into committing theft-by-conversion by sending it part of a workers pay in the absence of a court order to do so. This form not only repeatedly refers to its target as an \"employee\", inviting agreement by acquiescence, but it includes extended excerpts from Section 6331 of the IRC, concerning Levy and Distraint, on its back, allowing t hose excerpts to imply authority for the requested seizure. The careful observer will notice, however, that the excerpts start with subparagraph (b) of that section.

Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a levy shall extend only to property possessed and obligations existing at the time thereof.

As such a business might otherwise fear the legal consequences of unlawfully demanding the form as a condition for fulfilling the obligations of the contract into which it has entered with a worker, or be cognizant of the consequences of pretending to be a federal official (the only entity in connection with which a W-4 could be required), the law regarding the W-4 is equipped with what appears to be a \"safe harbor\" element.

Though perhaps a bit disingenuously, a worker could and would easily and credibly maintain, in the course of suing or prosecuting a business over what is no more or less than theft- by-conversion, that in addition to responding to the coercion and false claims of authority by which she was induced to execute the form, she at bottom complied because of the reasonable presumption that the W-4 would only become an active instrument if and when t he business's affairs contrived to cause her pay to be effectively connected with a taxable activity. That the business instead withheld from her private- sector, untaxable receipts is entirely its own responsibility.

The amounts withheld under its provisions are credited against any liability for \"income\" tax which might be found to exist under the provisions of subtitle A— in regard to which, as we know, remuneration for private-sector work is explicitly excluded.

Anyone currently working for others who has been forced or fooled into improperly submitting a W-4 might wish to withdraw the authority to withhold that the form represents, by filing an appropriately worded instrument with their personnel department, such as this: TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY TO WITHHOLD (Company's Name) is notified hereby that I, (Worker's Name) am declaring ended and withdrawn as of this date, (Today's Date) , any and all authorization and/or agreement for the withholding of any portion of compensation owed me for services rendered howsoever such authorization and/or agreement may have been conveyed, executed, or implied at any time.

Well, then, what is your Employer Identification Number (EIN)?\" If one hasn't been executed already, they will prod uce a Form SS-4, by which the naive new business customer can create a legal presumption that theirs is the sort of entity in need of such a number.

Now, disregarding the special groups previously examined and those in the alcohol, tobacco, or firearms businesses (for all of whom special statutory assignments of liability and requirements for returns apply), here is the general statutory requirement to make a return: Sec. 6012. - Persons required to make returns of income (a) General rule Returns with respect to income taxes under subtitle A shall be made by the following: (1) (A) Every individual ha ving for the taxable year gross income which equals or exceeds the exemption amount,...

This is all consistently expressed in the instructions for the Form SS-4 (Application for an Employer Identification Number): Do I Need an EIN? File Form SS-4 if the applicant entity does not already have an EIN but is required to show an EIN on any return, statement, or other document. For example, a sole proprietorship or self-employed farmer who establishes a qualified retirement plan, or is required to file excise, employment, alcohol, tobacco, or firearms returns, must have an EIN. A partnership, corporation, REMIC (real estate mortgage investment conduit), nonprofit organization (church, club, etc.), or farmers' cooperative must use an EIN for any tax-related purpose even if the entity does not have employees. (By now, every reader will have immediately noted that this instruction does not simply say, \"File Form SS-4 if your business does not already have an EIN.\") The application says in its required Privacy Act notice that: We ask for the information on this form to carry out the Internal Revenue laws of the United States.

The professionals won't, of course, acknowledge the quote marks around these terms. Nor will they explain that since both the form and the number are only intended for use by a government or \"effectively-connected\" \"income\" paying or receiving entity, a colorable basis for an IRS presumption that the new venture is such an entity is thereby generated. It must be said that the Form SS-4 is more benign than most such instruments, as a signature- to which penalties of perjury, as usual, attach- isn't actually demanded from most of those to whom such a form is presented. No one would know that by looking at the form itself, though, nor discover it without reading to the very last of six dense pages of bureaucratese in the form of detailed instructions available upon request. I will say with virtual certainty that almost everyone who fills out the form signs it under penalties of perjury, just as, I am confident, the IRS prefers. Even without a signature, of course, the very act of completing and submitting the form works against the submitter- both in its creation of the presumption noted earlier, and in serving as an announcement to the schemers of a new target in play. A bank or client compelling the submission of an SS-4 is, in that latter respect, akin to a Chamber of Commerce insisting that as a condition of membership, notice of the opening of one's new shop be sent to the gang of hoodlums running the protection racket in that particular district. However, I will point out that just as a worker pressured to execute a W-4 doesn't transform themselves into an \"employee\" and their pay into \"wages\", requesting an EIN doesn't make one an \"employer\", any more than buying a fishing license makes one a fisherman.

Nonetheless, and particular ly regarding demands for such filings, forms and submissions that DO require a signature, I will suggest that prudence di ctates leaving declarations of status to the party alleging an obligation. In other words, if the IRS, or anyone, says that some instrument must be executed on or by which is made a statement such as, \"I Am A U.S. person\", or \"[the named party] was paid $ _____ in wages (as defined in section 3401)\", etc., it is only sensible and proper for the responding party to send the asserting party the relevant information and let it fill out and sign the form. For instance, a business owner, at the end of the year, could send records of amounts paid to workers- carefully avoiding the use of any possibly misleading legal terms such as \"employee\", \"wages\", etc.- to the IRS along with blank \"Wage and Tax Statement\" forms and let the agency, as a good public servant, prepare and distribute them. Similarly, someone of whom a signed W-9 is being demanded could provide a copy of their birth certificate or business papers- along with an affidavit regarding the withholding question— and let whoever is making the demand fill out and execute the form. In light of the fact that such declarations are often dependent upon complex legal distinctions, and significant liabilities are attendant upon error, it is only appropriate that the insistent government experts make such determinations, with the lay party confining its participation in the process to challenging any such as might be made incorrectly. After all, if the respondent really IS an \"employer\", or whatever, its acknowledgment or denial of the fact is meaningless— it's true regardless of that party's attitude and with or without its signature. 160"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Feeding The Hand That Bites You Upon receiving a Form SS-4, the IRS will promptly and helpfully begin sending the new business Form 941's, (\"Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return\") and Form 8109's (Federal Tax Deposit Coupon) with which to fulfill the obligations attendant upon the status implied by the submission, and will express considerable umbrage if those properly executed forms (and the associated tax payments) don't show up in the agency's mailbox in a timely fashion. The service doesn't wait for cause before expressing itself. These forms arrive accompanied by a selection of regulatory language in a \"What If I'm Late Making A Payment?\"- type Q & A format, carefully calculated to nip-in-the-bud any questions about the legal applicabi lity of the whole program.

Like all such terms, it is created and used for very deliberate reasons (among which is not brevity or clarity). Internal Revenue Code, Section 7701(a)(14): Taxpayer: The term 'taxpayer' means any person subject to any internal revenue tax.

The custom legal term \"taxpayer\" is easily mistaken for this normal, common language homonym— indeed, as with most such terms within the \"income\" tax scheme, a determined effort is constantly underway to encourage exactly that mistake- but it is a grave and widely misleading error.

Employers Reinsurance Corp., 345 Mo. 650, 136 S.W. 2d 289, 302 Black's Law Dictionary, 5th edition. As we learn by examining the key element in the definition of \"taxpayer\", the term actually means, \"a person liable (obligated) for an internal revenue tax\" such as \"income\" taxes and certain other specific excises involving alcohol, tobacco, etc. Thus, despite paying fuel taxes, airport taxes, property taxes, alcohol taxes, tobacco taxes- in fact, hundreds of federal taxes (for all of which liability falls on the vendor)- the vast majority of adult American citizens are not \"taxpayers\", because they are not \"employers\", \"withholding agents\", recipients of \"income\" in more than the exemption amount, or other such specialized entities by virtue of which liability for an internal revenue tax might arise. Of course, the IRS sees and describes such citizens differently, perhaps in order to secure, through a lack of protest to the application of the term, more presumptive evidence regarding the status of intended targets. Also, of course, partly because the agency's only awar eness of any given person is through documents such as those we have discussed 164"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"About 1040's, And Claiming Refunds throughout this part of 'Cracking the Code', which, if accurate, would mean that they WERE a \"taxpayer\". Far and away the largest part of the tax law, and particularly the administrative portion at which we will be looking now, addresses and affects only those who are \"taxpayers\". But there are certain sections, and parts of sections, that are written with others in mind. These are often distinguishable solely by the qu iet substitution of 'person' or 'individual' etc., where \"taxpayer\" is otherwise typically used. Because such sections are almost seamlessly intermingled with preceding and succeeding sections which reference-- and exclusively apply to-- \"taxpayers\", it is easy to misunderstand and imagine that the 'persons' to which the odd portion refers are obliged or restricted by the \"taxpayer only\" portions, when this is not the case. We will be observing this distinction in key places as we now proceed. (An ongoing sensitivity to this nuance is also important. Any non-\"taxpayer\" implementing what we are about to discuss is likely to encounter stubborn IRS efforts to steer them into frustrating administrative procedures and requirements solely provided for, and appropriate to, \"taxpayers\". It is critical to know, in such circumstances, that any commands incorporating language such as, \"The taxpayer s hall...\" don't apply and are, in fact, virtually guaranteed to be counterproductive.) Since the beginning of the \"income\" tax, provision has been made by which an entity (an individual, company, etc.) can make a legal statement regarding its receipts- either to pro-actively announce otherwise unrecorded \"income\" or to address by confirmation, rebuttal or modification the declarations of others regarding those receipts.

The government is authorized to assess the taxes due on whatever that final \"income\" figure proves to be. Note that there is no practical downside to neglecting to make a return for anyone whose \"income\" is below the exemption amount-- in the worst case, an erroneous assertion to the contrary by the government is simply answered by a corrective return, and the matter is finished.

So, down through the years, one of the primary functions of a Form 1040 is unchanged: The making of a legally definitive statement as to amount of \"income\", either proactively or reactively, and either by or on behalf of, a citizen. The law still provides no authority by which the government is empowered to override the definitive assertion of a private, non- governmentally-connected citizen as to amount of \"income\" received. In such a case, after all, the government is only a potential beneficiary. It has no personal knowledge of the facts or other legal standing. Because of the structure of the scheme, it can have an active role as a biased intermediary in a dispute involving one party's erroneous documentary assertions regarding the \"income\" of another party.

No flurry of allegations is sufficiently large to make Joe's Auto Repair into the Department of Transportation. The government can contest the assertions of actual federal and \"State\" officers and \"employees\" though, because as the paymaster, the government itself has direct, personal knowledge of the facts-- it is itself one of the parties in the \"income\" transaction-- and it has standing as a contracting party.

Indeed, until the enac tment of the Current Tax Payment Act of 1943, the law made no particularly explicit provisions for dealing with the refund of amounts taken from persons for whom no tax liability existed. But with that act, doubtless in recognition of the fact that its easily misunderstood language could lead to withholding being improperly applied to non-government persons, Congress added the sections establishing penalties for fraudulent or erroneous W-2's at which we looked in 'Lies, Damned Lies, and W-2's', and amended the existing section relating to the credit for tax withheld on \"wages\" (section 35), into what are now sections 6401(b)(l) and (c), and 31(a)(l), of the IRC: Section 6401- Amounts treated as overpayments (b) Excessive credits (1) In general If the amount allowable as credits under subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 (relating to refundable credits) exceeds the tax imposed by subtitle A (reduced by the credits allowable under subparts A, B, D, and G of such part IV), the 174"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"About 1040's, And Claiming Refunds amount of such excess shall be considered an overpayment (c) Rule where no tax liability An amount paid as tax shall not be considered not to constitute an overpayment solely by reason of the fact that there was no tax liability in respect of which such amount was paid.

You can see that Congress was trying hard to make this simple. This section establishes that amounts withheld under the provisions of Chapter 24 (\"employment\" withholding) are claimable as overpayments- even when the amounts were withheld from someone with no associated tax liability, which is to say, a non-\"taxpayer\". 6401 also precludes the barring of amounts withheld as tax under Chapter 21 (FICA taxes) from being treated as overpayments. Obviously, anyone who has not received \"income\" and is being lawfully dealt with by payers will have no need to use a 1040 for the claim of a refund, as nothing will have been withheld in the first place.

Happily, in addition to the statutor y provisions for filing claims at which we have just looked, there are two convenient regulatory provisions which simplify the process of making such corrections. In the case of contractor payees, the chief evidentiary instrument to be corrected is the Form 1099. This typically would only need to be done proactively if money has been withheld in connection with the form, and a claim for refund is being made.

The name of the form sufficiently explains its purpose, which is also more-or-less expressed by the instructions on the back of the form: Purpose of Form - Form 4852 is completed by taxpayers or their representatives when their employer gives them an incorrect Form W-2 or an incorrect Form 1099- R. 177"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code This form is also used when the employer or payer does not give the taxpayer a Form W-2 or Form 1099-R.

The form is, as I noted ear lier, easy to complete, particularly when the erroneous W-2 which is being corrected is handy. Almost everything from the faulty form is simply transcribed to the corresponding spot on the 4852- the only items that change are the amounts of \"wages as defined in section 3401(a)\" and \"wages as defined in section 3121(a)\". Where line 8 asks how the amounts in item 7 were arrived at, that same original W-2 provides the answer, as in, \"records provided by the payer listed on line 5\". Line 9's question about efforts to obtain a corrected W-2 from the payer is answered with whatever is appropriate, which may well be \"none\".

No one in the IRS has any personal or direct knowledge regarding such matters. Another thing it will not do is just send the money, except to the lucky few. The agency will attempt to deny that a return was ever sent, either by simple declaration or by alleging a defect making the return unprocessable, and therefore will treat it as though never filed.

In service to this voracious monster, the courts, all the way up to the Supreme Court, have let stand uncorrected (and occasionally participated in) corrupt administrations of 'law' effectively gutting the Fourth Amendment protection against general warrants; the Fifth Amendment protections against being forced to provide evidence against oneself and of due process before a loss of property; and the Seventh Amendment guarantee of a jury trial in civil cases. Not the least of this class of offense has been the institutional characterization of punishments of ruinous proportion, in response to alleged \"crimes of omission\" in which the government claims to be the aggrieved party, as \"civil\" penalties— in order that Sixth Amendment protections of a trial by jury for the accused can be circumvented.

The original Articles of Confederation provided no power of taxation to the federal government, because such a power was perceived as dangerous to liberty, in part under the principle that the more distant the taxing power from the citizen, the less responsive it would be to his oversight and discipline. In reluctantly granting a taxing power in the reformed Constitution, specific limitations were placed upon the two forms permitted in order to ensure that the people would retain the ability to restrain a spendthrift congress and exercise their ultimate sovereignty. Specific limitations were also placed upon the objects for which taxes could be sought. As Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story observes in his 1833 Commentaries on the Constitution: § 904. Before proceeding to consider the nature and extent of the power conferred by this clause, and the reasons, on which it is founded, it seems necessary to settle the grammatical construc tion of the clause, and to ascertain its true reading. Do the words, \"to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises,\" constitute a distinct, substantial power; and the words, \"to pay debts and provide for the common defence, and general welfare of the United States,\" constitute another distinct and substantial power? Or are the latter words connected with the former, so as to constitute a qualification upon them? This has been a topic of political controversy; and has furnished abundant materials for popular declamation and alarm.

The former opinion has been maintained by some minds of great ingenuity, and liberality of views. The latter has been the generally received sense of the nation, and seems supported by reasoning at once solid and impregnable. The readi ng, therefore, which will be maintained in these commentaries, is that, which makes the latter words a qualification of the former; and this will be best illustrated by supplying the words, which are necessarily to be understood in this interpretation. They will then stand thus: \"The congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, in order to pay the debts, and to provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States; \" that is, for the purpose of paying the public debts, and providing for the common defence and general welfare of the United States. In this sense, congress has not an unlimited power of taxation; but it is limited to specific objects,--the payment of the public debts, and providing for the common defence and general welfare. A tax, therefore, laid by congress for neither of these objects, would be unconstitutional, as an excess of its legislative authority.

These elements work together, politically and practically, to discipline the state. The mechanism of Constitutional direct taxation requires- in the form of an individual, positive act of Congress and the executive- an identification of the subject of the tax, the purpose of the expenditure, and the specific amount proposed to be collected; while indirect taxes are for the mo st part avoidabl e at the will of the citizenry. From the birth of the nation until 1943 this disciplined system proved itself the goose that lays the golden eggs by nurturing the laissez-faire economy that not only stood on its own merits as the only truly moral system, but grew to become one of the greatest benefactors of humanity known to history. American freedom, unburdened as it was by an interfering and confiscatory government, unleashed a productive and innovative genius that uplifted the world. Since then, the antithesis of discipline has taken control. In effectively imposing, through corrupt and fraudulent administration, an unlimited, unapportioned direct tax on property, the \"income\" tax scheme has opened a spigot of money into the federal treasury, for no specific purposes, in no specific amount, and by a process all but unavoidable by the \"tax\" payer. The intended restraint is nullified, and the individual authority of any single citizen is drowned in an ocean of the commons, left with only the thin reed of one vote among 200 million with which to try to turn out the spendthrifts. Consequently, • The fraudulent \"income\" tax scheme is the mother of the activist state. While many programs partake of, and contribute to, the legal and philosophical corruption mentioned earlier, it is the easy money provided by the \"income tax scheme that feeds 192"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Why It Matters them all. Government in the United States spent more money (in inflation adjusted dollars) in 2001 alone than it did in the 114 years from 1787 to 1900 combined (Stephen Moore, Institute for Policy Innovation report #161, 2002). Not only was this money spent indiscriminately and with abandon, but most of the spending was actively harmful to the interests of those from whom it was taken. Without undertaking to assess particular programs, I will declare it axiomatic that as the amount of money available for government redistribution rises so too does the political servicing of special, narrow interests in defiance of, and therefore to the detriment of, the general market forces upon which we all rely for accurate, reliable information and a level playing field on which to compete. With government at all levels controlling through taxation about 50% of the American GDP (roughly 60% of which proportion is taken through the \"income\" tax scheme) such occasions are myriad. This is real \"supply-side\" economics. A incoming supply of money— with which constituents can be bribed, patronage financed, and power-bases expanded— creates a demand for programs by which it can be justified (and every \"program\" once established becomes a supply of justification, beneficiary constituents, and campaign cash). At one time, particularly during the first century of the nation's existence when Constitutional direct tax submissions addressed most federal revenue ne eds other than the extremely insignificant routine operational budget (financed mostly through tariffs), a special expenditure requirement led to the (usually temporary) establishment of a particular revenue stream. Since the successful im plementation of the \"income\" tax scheme during the emotional and distracted years of the second world war, the process has been reversed, with the existence of the revenue stream leading to the adoption of special expenditures and the maintenance of old ones whose raison d'etre has long passed. The federal revenue process has thus gone from being a budget to being a sort of a defined- 193"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code benefit plan, with benefit growth more-or-less matching the steady growth of the revenue stream. And it is steady, and inevitably so; the nature of the scheme ensures this. In times of economic contraction, the federal \"income\" tax revenue is protected by \"bracket creep\". This is the pushing of a given amount of wealth-production, such as a worker's annual output, into a higher \"tax\" bracket (seizure of a larger percentage of the wealth) as the number of dollars needed to represent (and compensate for) that output increases due to the inflation. The activating inflation (expansion of the money supply in excess of the rate of economic expansion) is an inevitable characteristic of contraction- and is itself a guarant or of the continuity of the federal revenue. Inflation, afte r all, is nothing more than the injection into the money supply of unaccounted for- in other words, free-- currency by way of government spending. As such, it represents an economic gain to the government exactly proportional to the devaluation of the public supply of currency. (It may, by the way, be more accurate to say that recession is an inevitable characteristic of inflation, rather than the other way around, but that is a subject for another book). During economic expansion, the scheme provides for a similar and even more aggressive growth phenomenon in the federal revenue process- because the revenue arising from a general tax on all economic activity (to which the scheme, in practice, amounts) automatically increases with growth in the economy. Every new business, every new worker, every new market and every productivity boost represents an increase in the scheme's \"tax base\". This is why the federal budget has held basically steady as a percent age of the economy since the dedicated implementation of the \"income\" tax scheme in the mid 1940's despite the relative explosion of personal wealth and general productivity improvements during the same period, both of which should have diminished the government share of the economy. 194"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Why It Matters In the real world, of course, the kid who cuts your grass doesn't get an automatic and proportional increase in his price per acre as your wealth increases; rather his price, in real dollars, stays about the same- and diminishes as a percentage of your increasing wealth. A legitimate, need-based (demand- driven) federal budget is subject to the same simple economic principles. Only in the looking- glass world of the \"income\" tax scheme can the federal revenue have become a cancerous organic component of the general economy, sharing the larger organism's growth rate in good times and exceeding it in bad. In the end, the only aspect of the current federal revenue process still re miniscent of budgeting is the occasional tax-rate (or object) fine-tuning which is undertaken to shift attention away from some particular boondoggle that has errantly caught the public eye. This is not actual budgeting, of course, it's just smoke-and-mirror politicking. Overall, the level of spending just continues to go nowhere but up, year after year. • The scheme, as fraudulently administered and defended, is inherently divisive. When control of 50% of the nation's wealth production is in play, the individual interests of everyone are also at stake; therefore, influencing that control becomes the natural imperative of all citizens with the requisite capacity of either wealth or numbers- and the shameful victimization of all those without. Thus, in asserting broad and inescapable claims, the \"income\" tax scheme induces in the community the arbitrary, degenerate and brutal \"war of all against all\" that darkened Thomas Hobbes's narrow, but celebrated, vision of human relations- and against which the Founders provided, through careful and deliberate limitations on the powers and purposes of their creations.

It was the Founders' superior understanding that any centralization of significant power simply institutionalizes and makes constant the abuse of some by others, producing steady- state oppression punctuated by per iodic struggles for supremacy in the all-or-nothing relationship. They also recognized that this was true not only of an autocracy or oligarchy but also of the alternative of an unrestricted democracy, which inevitably devolves into a self-eviscerating despotism as a majority learns that it can command power to its benefit at the inescapable expense of a victimized minority. As James Madison observed, \"Democracies have been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their death.\" Their deep comprehension of, and reverence for, the principles of sovereignty and natural law led these brilliant men unerringly to the true solution: The institutional acknowledgement that power originates in each individual citizen. This diffuse power- accompanied by a fluid civil mechanism with which it can be coordinated at need, but dependent on the voluntary, self-interested cooperation of its disparate elements-- uniquely minimizes the incentive for ruinous and bitter struggles for its control, provides sufficient security for participants, and ensures that abuse and oppression at its hands would be only isolated, occasional and brief.

The struggle to control this enormous power- against which no one is secure and which is inherently abusive and oppressive- has become the national pastime, incidentally corrupting even the simplest and most fundamental elements of the political process.

A great historical ignorance is necessary to permit the embrace, for example, of the government-promoted myth that in 1913 (when the 16th Amendment was passed) the ascendant and muscular populist movement fastened upon the country a tax reaching all economic transactions- including the recompense from long hours of labor received by the common workers of which it was predominantly composed. That such a thing would be proposed by any political majority is unlikel y at best; that it should have been done by this particularly class-conscious movement, nurtured as it was by a conviction that fat-cat robber-barons controlled the federal government— including the application of its taxing powers- is absurd.

That these myths, and others of the same ilk, are even in circulation, considering the clear words of the Constitution (not to mention the Supreme Court's frequently repeated declarations that, \"The provisions of the Sixteenth Amendment conferred no new power of taxation...\") is a testament to the abject failure, at the very least, of the government education industry for which we pay so much- if not its calculated subordination to the interests of the scheme's beneficiaries. All of the corruptions of law, morals, prudence and understanding essential to the \"income\" tax scheme can only hold sway over a population generally weak in both knowledge and wisdom. It is, therefore, in perfect harmony with the scheme that governments at all levels have complacently or complicitly allowed the public education industry to steadily devolve from its original mission of preparing sovereign citizens for the responsibilities of a dulthood into a combination of day-care, vocational training, and laboratory for unproven 'educational' fads. A recent report on the state of civics education in America today by the National C enter for Policy Analysis reflects this degeneration: \"According to a survey of top seniors at 55 colleges and universities by the Roper organization: 198"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Why It Matters • While nearly 100 percent could identify cartoon characters Beavis and Butthead and rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg, only 34 percent knew George Washington was the American general at the battle of Yorktown. • Only a third were able to identify the Constitution as establishing the division of powers in the U.S. government. • Eighty-one percent of those top students earned a D or F in response to basic historical questions. Only 25 states now require any civics education in public schools at all, and U.S. adults finished last in a nine- nation survey asking respondents to identify regions and countries on an unmarked map of the world. Fourteen percent couldn't even find the United States.\" Analyzing the 1998 National Assessment of Educational Proficiency, wakingbear.com observes that, \"The NAEP test showed that 35% of America s high school seniors didn't even have an understanding of civics that experts consider \"basic. \"Another 39% only scored at the basic level. Just 22% of seniors had a \"proficient\" understanding of how the American government works. And one in 25 scored at the \"advanced\" level. Results for the other grades tested - 4th and 8th - mirrored those of the high-school seniors, with less than one in four students scoring at or above the level deemed \"proficient\" And a closer look at high- school seniors' responses to individual questions often suggests they do not know why American government is set up the way it is. For example, just one in four seniors could come up with two ways the U.S. system of government prevents the exercise of \"absolute arbitrary "},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code power\" on the part of the government. Among the 14 possible answers were such ba sics as the Bill of Rights, an independent judiciary, civilian control of the military - and the right to vote. On a multiple-choice question asking the purpose of the Bill of Rights, one-third of high school seniors did not know that it was written to limit the power of the federal government. Not one in 10 seniors could identify two ways that a democracy benefits from the active participation of its citizens. Just over a third knew that the Supreme Court pointed to the Constitution's 14th Amendment when it began to overturn segregation laws. That shouldn't come as much of a surprise. Other surveys, both formal and informal, suggest that America's future voters and jurors simply do not know much about the country's founding. In a 1998 poll conducted by the National Constitution Center, not one in 50 American teenagers could identify James Madison as the father of the U.S. Constitution. Not even half could name the three branches of the federal government. And not one in ten could name the landmark Supreme Court case (Brown vs. Board of Education) that ended segregation in the public schools. And in an informal survey of Bay area teenagers, San Francisco Examiner reporter Emily Gurnon found that less than half of the 4 dozen teens she quizzed could name the country from which the U.S. won its independence. Gurnon asked what July 4th celebrated. One high-school graduate told her, \"It's like the freedom. Some war was fought and we won, so we got our freedom. \"From which country? That graduate didn't know. 200"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Why It Matters Another high school graduate also knew that July 4th celebrated Americas independence. From which country? \"I want to say Korea,\" he told Gurnon. How long ago did it take place? \"Like 50 years,\" he guessed.\" The rapid spread of government schooling during the 20 th century was, undoubtedly, innocently coincidental with the concurrent implementation of the \"income\" tax scheme. Similarly, the de-emphasis of history, logic, and meaningful \"civics\" in those schools over the last forty years probably serves, and is primarily responsive to, other interests. Although it would be too much to blame the uninterrupted decline of quality in public schools and their curricula on the scheme, still, that decline has unquestionably contributed to its success. Applying the principle of 'cui bono', it is reasonable to conclude that the governments which control the public schools have been operating under a powerful incentive to simply let them continue to fail. Thus, this pernicious fraud manages not only to darken our own minds and lives, but to blight those of our children as well. • Effectively presented as an involuntary requirement, the scheme corrupts our fundamental principle of equal treatment under the law with a progressive structure under which some citizens are able to force a benefit for themselves out of the pockets of their neighbors. This callous design, intended to maximize the protective political support for the scheme by invoking Shaw's principle that. \"A government which robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul\", engenders institutional endorsement of the proposition that a form of slavery is a fundamental element of social justice. (Where the tax lawfully applies, of course-- as an expected cost of voluntarily enjoying the benefit of federal privilege- unequal 701"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code treatment is no more unfair than is having to pay more for good seats at the show). This is a particularly noxious perversion, in that under this \"justice\" a heavier burden is extracted from some Americans precisely because they have already made a greater contribution to the common weal than others. After all, one earns one's unprivileged 'receipts solely by serving the interests of one's neighbors. Furthermore, contrary to the many false intellections marshaled to support this aspect of the scheme, the more such receipts that one's good service brings in, the less demand one places on, and the less benefit one has from the community resources-- making the progress ive structure of the tax even more obscene. The reality is that a successful wealth-producer has typically been more adamant and persistent than others in defying and surmounting the public infrastructure and its typically sclerotic defense of t he status quo. (The exception is those who have used government to their advantage; their gains, of course, are the lawful objects of the \"income\" tax as properly applied). As to public services, the well-to-do place far less demand on such expenses than others- they draw no public welfare, they are privately insu red, they live where the local services are equitably paid for out of (typically) high local tax rates. In other words, they pay their own way. The vigorous efforts of many in positions of authority and respect to seduce Americans into accepting the st anding of these truths on their heads, in order to ensure that the gravy-train of professional fees, bureaucratic power, and re -election will continue, is a national scandal.

It is among the key mechanisms making possible one of the greatest achievements in human history: The truly practical and, overall, harmonious organization of a large and widely dispersed society providing security, economic vitality, resources and room. Such an organization is naturally and necessarily dependent for its success and stability (not to m ention worth) upon scrupulous respect for property rights, along with the rule of law. By virtue of this towering achievement, the rights of Americans were well secured for many, many years, even as the nation rose to ever- greater general prosperity despite periodic wars, recessions, and social upheavals.

However restrained any system admitting of a forcible claim by others to the property or labor of their neighbor might be at a particular time, at its very best it must be hobbled by uncertainty and constant struggle. Inevitably, of course, such despotisms ultimately degenerate into naked slavery. After all, by what argument can the claim to more be denied when the claim to a little has been acknowledged? And is it not the nature of man to lower the bar steadily, once it has been let move at all? To say otherwise is to be naive or disingenuous, and flies in the face of all history. The \"income\" tax scheme and much of the juggernaut of government that it sustains manifestly stand as deep-rooted impediments to the fulfillment of our civic responsibility. It is fortunate, therefore, that however obscure and misunderstood they may have become, the actual statutes relating to taxation have remained consistent with, and respectful of, the wise and critical requirements laid down by the founders in the fundamental law. All that each of us need do is invoke the written law and claim the return of money improperly withheld; de-authorize improper withholdings for the future; rebut any erroneous assertions by others who have paid us; correct any improper assertions that we have made ourselves... and then abide the storm of protest, denial, resistance, intimidation, threats and perhaps inju stice which will follow.

As the volume of these filings rose in recent years, the deadly threat to the scheme represented by widespread knowledge of how to prepare an accurate return caught the attention of its administrator-beneficiaries. These \"public servants\" frantically initiated a dedicated effort to trip up such filers by capitalizing on the nuances, idiosyncrasies and quirks in the law which we have discussed throughout this book.

Because of constitutional questions duly arising the case is here on direct appeal from a decree sustaining a motion to dismiss because no ground for relief was stated. The right to prevent the corporation from returning and paying the tax was based upon many averments as to the repugnancy of the statute to the Constitution of the United States, of the peculiar relation of the corporation to the stockholders, and their particular interests resulting from many of the administrative provisions of the assailed act, of the confusion, wrong, and multiplicity [240 U.S. 1, 10] of suits and the absence of all means of redress which would result if the corporation paid the tax and complied with the act in other respects without protest, as it was alleged it was its intention to do. To put out of the way a question of jurisdiction we at once say that in view of these averments and the ruling in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & T. Co. 157 U.S. 429 , 39 L ed. 759, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 673, sustaining the right of a stockholder to sue to restrain a corporation under proper averments from voluntarily paying a tax charged to be unconstitutional on the ground that to permit such a suit did not violate the prohibitions of 3224, Revised Statutes (Comp. Stat. 1913, 5947), against enjoining the enforcement of taxes, we are of opinion that the contention here made that there was no jurisdiction of the cause, since to entertain it would violate the provisions of the Revised Statutes referred to, is without merit. Before coming to dispose of t he case on the merits, however, we observe that the defendant corporation having called the attention of the government to the pendency of the cause and the nature of the controversy and its unwillingness to voluntarily refuse to comply with the act assailed, the United States, as amicus curiae, has at bar been heard both orally and by brief for the purpose of sustaining the decree. 210"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Appendix Aside from averments as to citi zenship and residence, recitals as to the provisions of the statute, and statements as to the business of the corporation, contained in the first ten paragraphs of the bill, advanced to sustain jurisdiction, the bill alleged twenty-one constitutional objections specified in that number of paragraphs or subdivisions. As all the grounds assert a violation of the Constitution, it follows that, in a wide sense, they all charge a repugnancy of the statute to the 16th Amendment, under the more immediate sanction of which the statute was adopted. The various propositions are so intermingled as to cause it to be difficult to classify them. We ar e of opinion, however, [240 U.S. 1, 11] that the confusion is not inherent, but rather arises from the conclusion that the 16th Amendment provides for a hitherto unknown power of taxation; that is, a power to levy an income tax which, although direct, should not be subject to the regulation of apportionment applicable to all other direct taxes. And the far-reaching effect of th is erroneous assumption will be made clear by generalizing the many contentions advanced in argument to support it, as follows: (a) The Amendment authorizes only a particular character of direct tax without apportionment, and therefore if a tax is levied under its assumed authority which does not partake of the characteristics exacted by the Amendment, it is outside of the Amendment, and is void as a direct tax in the general constitutional sense because not apportioned, (b) As the Amendment authorizes a tax only upon incomes 'from whatever source derived,' the exclusion from taxation of some income of designated persons and classes is not authorized, and hence the constitutionality of the law must be tested by the general provisions of the Constitution as to taxation, and thus again the tax is void for want of apportionment, (c) As the right to tax 'incomes from whatever source derived' for which the Amendment provides must be considered as exacting intrinsic uniformity, therefore no tax comes under the authority of the Amendment not 21"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code conforming to such standard, and hence all the provisions of the assailed statute must once more be tested solely under the general and pre-existing provisions of the Constitution, causing the statute again to be void in the absence of apportionment, (d) As the power conferred by the Amendment is new and prospective, the attempt in the statute to make its provisions retroactively apply is void because, so far as the retroactive period is concerned, it is governed by the pre-existing constitutional requirement as to apportionment. But it clearly results that the proposition and the contentions [240 U.S. 1, 12] under it, if acceded to, would cause one provision of the Constitution to destroy another; that is, they would result in bringing the provisions of the Amendment exempting a direct tax from apportionment into irreconcilable conflict with the general requirement that all direct taxes be apportioned. Moreover, the tax authorized by the Amendment, being direct, would not come under the rule of uniformity applicable under the Constitution to other than direct taxes, and thus it would come to pass that the result of the Amendment would be to authorize a particular direct tax not subject either to apportionment or to the rule of geographical uniformity, thus giving power to impose a different tax in one state or states than was levied in another state or states. This result, instead of simplifying the situation and making clear the limitations on the taxing power, which obviously the Amendment must have been intended to accomplish, would create radical and destructive changes in our constitutional sy stem and multiply confusion. But let us by a demonstration of the error of the fundamental proposition as to the significance of the Amendment dispel the confusion necessarily arising from the arguments deduced from it. Before coming, however, to the text of the Amendment, to the end that its significance may be determined in the light of the previous legislative and judicial history of the subject with which the Amendment is concerned, and with a knowledge of the conditions which presumptively led up to its adoption, and 212"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Appendix hence of the purpose it was intended to accomplish, we make a brief statement on those subjects. That the authority conferred upon Congress by 8 of article 1 'to lay and collect taxes, duties, impo sts and excises' is exhaustive and embraces every conceivable power of taxation has never been questioned, or, if it has, has been so often authoritatively declared as to render it necessary only to state the doctrine. And it has also never [240 U.S. 1, 13] been questioned from the foundation, without stopping presently to determine under which of the separate headings the power was properly to be classed, that there was authority given, as the part was included in the whole, to lay and collect income taxes. Again, it has never moreover been questioned that the conceded complete and all- embracing taxing power was subject, so far as they were respectively applicable, to limitations resulting from the requirements of art. 1, 8, cl. 1, that 'all duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States,' and to the limitations of art I., 2, cl. 3, that 'direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states,' and of art 1, 9, cl. 4, that 'no capitation, or other direct, tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the census or enumeration hereinbefore directed to be taken.' In fact, the two great subdivisions embracing the complete and perfect delegation of the power to tax and the two correlated limitations as to such power were thus aptly stated by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & T. Co. 157 U. S. supra, at page 557: 'In the matter of taxation, the Constitution recognizes the two great classes of direct and indirect taxes, and lays down two rules by which their imposition must be governed, namely: The rule of apportionment as to direct taxes, and the rule of un iformity as to duties, imposts, and excises.' It is to be observed, however, as long ago pointed out in Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 541, 19 L ed. 482, 485, that the requirements of apportionment as to one of the great classes and of uniformity as to the other class were not so much a limitation upon the complete and all-embracing 213"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code authority to tax, but in their essence were simply regulations concerning the mode in which the plenary power was to be exerted. In the whole history of the government down to the time of the adoption of the 16th Amendment, leaving aside some conjectures expressed of the possibility of a tax lying intermediate between the two gr eat classes and embraced [240 U.S. 1, 14] by neither, no question has been anywhere made as to the correctness of these propositions. At the very beginning, however, there arose differences of opinion concerning the criteria to be applied in determining in which of the two great subdivisions a tax would fall. Without pausing to state at length the basis of these differences and the consequences which arose from them, as the whole subject was elaborately reviewed in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & T. Co. 157 U.S. 429 , 39 L ed. 759, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 673, 158 U.S. 601 , 39 L. ed. 1108, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 912, we make a condensed statement which is in substance taken from what was said in that case. Early the differences were manifested in pressing on the one hand and opposing on the other, the passage of an act levying a tax without apportionment on carriages 'for the conveyance of persons,' and when such a tax was enacted the question of its repugnancy to the Constitution soon came to this court for determination. Hylton v. United States, 3 Dall. 171, 1 L ed. 556. It was held that the tax came within the class of excises, duties, and imposts, and therefore did not require apportionment, and while this conclusion was agreed to by all the members of the court who took part in the decision of the case, there was not an exact coincidence in the reasoning by which the conclusion was sustai ned. Without stating the minor differences, it may be said with substantial accuracy that the divergent reasoning was this: On the one hand, that the tax was not in the class of direct taxes requiring apportionment, because it was not levied directly on property because of its ownership, but rather on its use, and was therefore an excise, duty, or impost; and on the other, that in any event the class of direct 214"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":" Appendix taxes included only taxes directly levied on real estate because of its ownership. Putting out of view the difference of reasoning which led to the concurrent conclusion in the Hylton Case, it is undoubted that it came to pass in legislative practice that the line of demarcation between the two great classes of direct taxes on the one hand and excises, duties, and [240 U.S. 1, 15] imposts on the other, which was exemplified by the ruling in that case, was accepted and acted upon. In the first place this is shown by the fact that wherever (and there were a number of cases of that kind) a tax was levied directly on real estate or slaves because of ownership, it was treated as coming within the direct class and apportionment was provided for, while no instance of apportionment as to any other kind of tax is afforded. Again the situation is aptly illustrated by the various acts taxing incomes derived from property of every kind and nature which were enacted beginning in 1861, and lasting during what may be termed the Civil War period. It is not disputable that these latter taxing laws were classed under the head of excises, duties, and im posts because it was assumed that they were of that character inasmuch as, although putting a tax burden on income of every kind, including that derived from property real or personal, they were not taxes directly on property because of its ownership. And this practical construction came in theory to be the accepted one, since it was adopted without dissent by the most eminent of the text writers. 1 Kent, Com. 254, 256; 1 Story, Const. 955; Cooley, Const.

Upon the lapsing of a considerable period after the repeal of the income tax laws referred to, in 1894 [28 Stat. at L. 509, chap. 349], an act was passed laying a tax on incomes from all classes of property and other sources of revenue which was not apportioned, and which therefore was of course assumed to come within the classification of excises, duties, and imposts '15"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code which were subject to the rule of uniformity, but not to the rule of apportionment. The constitution al validity of this law was challenged on the ground that it did not fall within the class of excises, duties, and imposts, [240 U.

Co. 157 U.S. 429 , 39 L. ed. 759, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 673, 158 U.S. 601, 39 L. ed. 1108, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 912. The court, fully recognizing in the passage which we have previous ly quoted the allembracing character of the two great classifications, including, on the one hand, direct taxes subject to apportionment, and on the other, excises, duties, and imposts subject to uniformity, held the law to be unconstitutional in substance for these reasons: Concluding that the classification of direct was adopted for the purpose of rendering it impossible to burden by taxation accumulations of property, real or personal, except subject to the regulation of apportionment, it was held that the duty existed to fix what was a direct tax in the constitutional sense so as to accomplish this purpose c ontemplated by the Constitution. (157 U.S. 581 .) Coming to consider the validity of the tax from this point of view, while not questioning at all that in common understanding it was direct merely on income and only indirect on property, it was held that, considering the substance of things, it was direct on property in a constitutional sense, since to burden an income by a tax was, from the point of substance, to burden the property from which the income was derived, and thus accomplish the very thing which the provision as to apportionment of direct taxes was adopted to prevent. As this conclusion but enforced a regulation as to the mode of exercising power under particular circumstances, it did not in any way dispute the all-embraci ng taxing authority possessed by Congress, including necessarily therein the power to impose income taxes if only they c onformed to the constitutional regulations which were applicable to them. Moreover, in 216"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Appendix addition, the conclusion reached in the Pollock Case did not in any degree involve holding that income taxes generically and necessarily came within the class [240 U.S. 1, 17] of direct taxes on property, but, on the contrary, recognized the fact that taxation on income was in its nature an excise entitled to be enforced as such unless and until it was concluded that to enforce it would amount to accomplishing the result which the requirement as to apportionment of direct taxation was adopted to prevent, in which case the duty would arise to disregard form and consider substance alone, and hence subject the tax to the regulation as to apportionment which otherwise as an excise would not apply to it. Nothing co uld serve to make this clearer than to recall that in the Pollock Case, in so far as the law taxed incomes from other classes of property than real estate and invested personal property, that is, income from 'professions, trades, employments, or vocations' ( 158 U.S. 637 ), its validity was recognized; indeed, it wa s expressly declared that no dispute was made upon that subject, and attention was called to the fact that taxes on such income had been sustained as excise taxes in the past. Id. p. 635. The whole law was, however, declared unconstitutional on the ground that to permit it to thus operate would relieve real estate and invested personal property from taxation and 'would leave the burden of the tax to be borne by professions, trades, employments, or vacations; and in that way what was intended as a tax on capital would remain, in substance, a tax on occupations and labor' (id. p. 637),-a result which, it was held, could not have been contemplated by Congress. This is the text of the Amendment: 'The Congress shall ha ve power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration.'

Indeed, in the light of the history which we have given and of the decision in the Pollock Case, and the ground upon which the ruling in that case was based, there is no escape from the conclusion that the Amendment was drawn for the purpose of doing away for the future with the principle upon which the Pollock Case was decided; that is, of determining whether a tax on income was direct not by a consideration of the burden placed on the taxed income upon which it directly operated, but by taking into view the burden which resulted on the property from which the income was derived, since in express terms the Amendment provides that income taxes, from whatever source the income may be derived, shall not be subject to the regulation of apportionment. From this in substance it indisputably arises, first, that all the contentions which we have previously noticed concerning the assumed limitations to be implied from the language of the Amendment as to the nature and character of the income taxes which it authorizes find no support in the text and are in irreconcilable conflict with the very purpose which the Amendment was adopted to accomplish. Second, that the contention that the Amendment treats a tax on income as a direct tax although it is relieved from apportionment and is necessarily therefore not subject to the rule of uniformity as such rule only applies to taxes which are not direct, thus destroying the two great classifications which have been recognized and enforced from the beginning, is also wholly without foundation since the command of the Amendment that all income taxes shall not be subject to apportionment by a consideration of the sources from which the taxed income may be derived [240 U.S. 1, 19] forbids the application to such 218"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":" Appendix taxes of the rule applied in the Pollock Case by which alone such taxes were removed from the great class of excises, duties, and imposts subject to the rule of uniformity, and were placed under the other or direct class. This must be unless it can be said that although the Constitution, as a result of the Amendment, in express terms excludes the criterion of source of income, that criterion yet remains for the purpose of destroying the classifications of the Constitution by taking an excise out of the class to which it belongs and transferring it to a class in which it cannot be placed consistently with the requirements of the Constitution. Indeed, from another point of view, the Amendment demonstrates that no such purpose was intended, and on the contrary shows that it was drawn with the object of maintaining the limitations of the Constitution and harmonizing their operation. We say this because it is to be observed that although from the date of the Hylton Case, because of statements made in the opinions in that case, it had come to be accepted that direct taxes in the constitutional sense were confined to taxes levied directly on real estate because of its ownership, the Amendment contains nothing repudiation or challenging the ruling in the Pollock Case that the word 'direct' had a broader significance, since it embraced also taxes levied directly on personal property because of its ownership, and therefore the Amendment at least impliedly makes such wider significance a part of the Constitu tion,-a condition which clearly demonstrates that the purpose was not to change the existing interpretation except to the extent necessary to accomplish the result intended; that is, the prevention of the resort to the sources from which a taxed income was derived in order to cause a direct tax on the income to be a direct tax on the source itself, and thereby to take an income tax out of the class of excises, duties, and imposts, and place it in the class of direct taxes. [240 U.S. 1, 20] We come, then, to ascertain the merits of the many contentions made in the light of the Constitution as it now stands; that is to say, including within its terms the 219"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code provisions of the 16th Amendment as correctly interpreted. We first dispose of two propositions assailing the validity of the statute on the one hand because of its repugnancy to the Constitution in other respects, and especially because its enactment was not authorized by the 16th Amendment. The statute was enacted October 3, 1913, and provided for a general yearly income tax from December to December of each year. Exceptionally, however, it fixed a first period embracing only the time from March 1, to December 31, 1913, and this limited retroactivity is assailed as repugnant to the due process clause of the 5th Amendment, and as inconsistent with the 16th Amendment itself. But the date of the retroactivity did not extend beyond the time when the Amendment was operative, and there can be no dispute that there was power by virtue of the Amendment during that period to levy the tax, without apportionment, and so far as the limitations of the Constitution in other respects are concerned, the contention is not open, since in Stockdale v. Atlantic Ins. Co. 20 Wall. 323, 331, 22 L. ed. 348, 351, in sustaining a provision in a prior income tax law which was assailed because of its retroactive character, it was said: The right of Congress to have imposed this tax by a new statute, although the measure of it was governed by the income of the past year, cannot be doubted; much less can it be doubted that it could impose such a tax on the income of the current year, though part of that year had elapsed when the statute was passed. The joint resolution of July 4th, 1864 [13 Stat. at L 417], imposed a tax of 5 per cent upon all income of the previous year, although one tax on it had already been paid, and no one doubted the validity of the tax or attempted to resist it.' [240 U.S. 1, 21] The statute provides that the tax should not apply to enumerated organizations or corporations, such as labor, agricultural or horticultural organizations, mutual savings 220"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":" Appendix banks, etc., and the argument is that as the Amendment authorized a tax on incomes 'from whatever source derived,' by implication it excluded the power to make these exemptions. But this is only a form of expressing the erroneous contention as to the meaning of the Amendment, which we have already disposed of. And so far as this alleged illegality is based on other provisions of the Constitution, the contention is also not open, since it was expressly considered and disposed of in Flint v. Stone Tracy Co. 220 U.S. 108, 173 , 55 S. L. ed. 389, 422, 31 Sup. Ct. Rep. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312 Without expressly stating all the other contentions, we summarize them to a degree adequate to enable us to typify and dispose of all of them. 1. The statute levies one tax called a normal tax on all incomes of individuals up to $20,000, and from that amount up, by gradations, a progressively increasing tax, called an additional tax, is imposed. No tax, however, is levied upon incomes of unmarried individuals amounting to $3, 000 or less, nor upon incomes of married persons amounting to $4,000 or less. The progressive tax and the exempted amounts, it is said, are based on wealth alone, and the tax is therefore repugnant to the due process clause of the 5th Amendment. 2. The act provides for collecting the tax at the source; that is, makes it the duty of corporations, etc., to retain and pay the sum of the tax on interest due on bonds and mortgages, unless the owner to whom the interest is payable gives a notice that he claims an exemption. This duty cast upon corporations, because of the cost to which they are subjected, is asserted to be repugnant to due process of law as a taking of their property without compensation, and we recapitulate various contentions as to discrimination against corporations and against individuals, [240 U.S. 1, 22] predicated on provisions of the act dealing with the subject. (a) Corporations indebted upon coupon and registered bonds are discriminated against, since corporations not so indebted are 221"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code relieved of any labor or expense involved in deducting and paying the taxes of individuals on the income derived from bonds. (b) Of the class of corporations indebted as above stated, the law further discriminates against those which have assumed the payment of taxes on their bonds, since although some or all of their bondholders may be exempt from taxation, the corporations have no means of ascertaining such fact, and it would therefore result that taxes would often be paid by such corporations when no taxes were owing by the individuals to the government. (c) The law discriminates against owners of corporate bonds in favor of individuals none of whose income is derived from such property, since bondholders are, during the interval between the deducting and the paying of the tax on their bonds, deprived of the use of the money so withheld. ( d ) Again, corporate bondholders are discriminated against because the law does not release them from payment of taxes on their bonds even after the taxes have been deducted by the corporation, and therefore if, after deduction, the corporation should fail, the bondholders would be compelled to pay the tax a second time. (e) Owners of bonds the taxes on which have been assumed by the corporation are discriminated against because the payment of the taxes by the corporation does not relieve the bondholders of their duty to include the income from such bonds in making a return of all income, the result being a double payment of the taxes, labor and expense in applying for a refund, and a deprivation of the use of the sum of the taxes during the interval which elapses before they are refunded. [240 U.S. 1, 23] 3. The provision limiting the amount of interest paid which may be deducted from gross income of corporations for the purpose of fixing the taxable income to interest on indebtedness not exceeding one half the sum of bonded indebtedness and paidup capital stock is also charged to be wanting in due 222"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":" Appendix process because discriminating between different classes of corporations and individuals. 4. It is urged that want of due process results from the provision allowing individuals to deduct from their gross income dividends paid them by corporatio ns whose incomes are taxed, and not giving such right of deduction to corporations. 5. Want of due process is also asserted to result from the fact that the act allows a deduction of $3,000 or $4,000 to those who pay the normal tax, that is, whose incomes are $20,000 or less, and does not allow the deduction to those whose incomes are greater than $20,000; that is, such persons are not allowed, for the purpose of the additional or progressive tax, a second right to deduct the $3,000 or $4,000 which they have already enjoyed. And a further violation of due process is based on the fact that for the purpose of the additional tax no second right to deduct dividends received from corporations is permitted. 6. In various forms of statement, want of due process, it is moreover insisted, arises from the provisions of the act allowing a deduction for the purpose of ascertaining the taxable income of stated amounts, on the ground that the provisions discriminate between married and single people, and discriminate between husbands and wives who are living together and those who are not. 7. Discrimination and want of due process result, it is said, from the fact that the owners of houses in which they live are not compelled to estimate the rental value in making up their incomes, while those who are living in rented houses and pay rent are not allowed, in making up their taxable income, to deduct rent which they have [240 U.S. 1, 24] paid, and that want of due process also results from the fact that although family expenses are not, as a rule, permitted to be deducted from gross, to arrive at taxable, income, farmers are permitted to omit from their income return certain products of the farm which are susceptible of use by them for sustaining their families during the year. 223"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Cracking the Code So far as these numerous and minute, not to say in many respects hypercritical, contentions are based upon an assumed violation of the uniformity clause, their want of legal merit is at once apparent, since it is settled that that clause exacts only a geographical uniformity, and there is not a semblance of ground in any of the propositions for assuming that a violation of such uniformity is complained of. Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U.S. 41, 44 L. ed. 969, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747; Patton v. Brady, 184 U.S. 608, 622 , 46 S. L. ed. 713, 720, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 493; Flint v.

So far as the due process clause of the 5th Amendment is relied upon, it suffices to say that there is no basis for such reliance, since it is equally well settled that such clause is not a limitation upon the taxing power conferred upon Congress by the Constitution; in other words, that the Constitution does not conflict with itself by conferring, upon the one hand, a taxing power, and taking the same power away, on the other, by the limitations of the due process cl ause. Treat v. White, 181 U.S. 264 , 45 L. ed. 853, 21 Sup. Ct. Rep. 611; Patton v. Brady, 184 U.S. 608 , 46 L. ed. 713, 22 Sup. Ct. Rep. 493; McCray v. United States, 195 U.S. 27, 61 , 49 S.

United States, 232 U.S. 261, 282 , 58 S. L. ed. 596, 605, 34 Sup. Ct. Rep. 421. And no change in the situation here would arise even if it be co nceded, as we think it must be, that this doctrine would have no application in a case where, although there was a seeming exer cise of the taxing power, the act complained of was so arbitrary as to constrain to the conclusion that it was not the exertion of taxation, but a confiscation of property; that is, a taking [240 U.S. 1, 25] of the same in violation of the 5th Amendment; or, what is 224"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":" Appendix equivalent thereto, was so wanting in basis for classification as to produce such a gross and patent inequality as to inevitably lead to the same conclusion. We say this because none of the propositions relied upon in the remotest degree present such questions. It is true that it is elaborately insisted that although there be no express constitutional provision prohibiting it, the progressive feature of the tax causes it to transcend the conception of all taxation and to be a mere arbitrary abuse of power which must be treated as wanting in due process. But the proposition disregards the fact that in the very early history of the government a progressive tax was imposed by Congress, and that such authority was exerted in some, if not all, of the various income taxes enacted prior to 1894 to which we have previously adverted. And over and above all this the contention but disregards the further fact that its absolute want of foundation in reason was plainly pointed out in Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U.S. 41, 44 L. ed. 969, 20 Sup. Ct. Rep. 747, and the right to urge it was necessarily foreclosed by the ruling in that case made. In this situation it is, of course, superfluous to say that arguments as to the expediency of levying such taxes, or of the economic mistake or wrong involved in their imposition, are beyond judicial cognizance. Besides this demonstration of the want of merit in the contention based upon the progressive feature of the tax, the error in the others is equally well established either by prior decisions or by the adequate bases for classification which are apparent on the face of the assailed provisions; that is, the distinction between individuals and corporations, the difference between various kinds of corporations, etc., etc. Ibid.; Flint v.

This is due, in part, to a lack of intimate familiarity with the relevant law of each of those 50 different jurisdictions; and, in part, in order to maintain a manageable scope to this book. Mostly, though, it is due to the fact that all of the State law at which I have looked in this respect is fundamentally and explicitly dependent upon the initial application of the federal law in its operation. In such cases, the union-State taxation of \"income\" involves the direct reliance by the State on whatever amount of \"income\" has been arrived at by the citizen through application of the relevant federal law. The States, in such cases, have no independent law regarding the determinatio n of that \"income\" amount. A typical structure for this regime will require the citizen to transfer the \"adjusted gross income\" figure from the appropriate line on his or her previously completed federal 1040 to the \"taxable income\" line on the State return. As a consequence, our examination herein of the federal law will, in many (if not al l) cases, amount to a sufficient analysis of union-State \"income\" tax law as well. I leave to each individual reader any necessa ry supplemental investigation of a particular State law, confident that any who have made it to this point in this book will find the task simple enough.
