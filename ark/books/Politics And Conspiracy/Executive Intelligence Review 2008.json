EI R From the Managing Editor L yndon LaRouche’s Feature on “That Doomed and Brutish Empire” is intended by the author as a pair with “On Monadology,” which ap - peared in EIR on Feb. 22. I can best introduce the second article, by quoting LaRouche’s introduction to the first: “At my present age of eighty-five,” he wrote, “I retain a happily vi - brant sense of what are, probably, the remaining productive years now ahead of me. However, I dare not ignore the prudence of saying now what it will be important that I would have said, while the opportunity still remains for me to do so. . . .” Matters of special importance, he continued, “such as my adoles - cent discovery of the meaning of Leibniz’s Monadology , must become shared, especially, by all those others among my associates generally, who have committed themselves to faithful promotion of that same kind of intended benefit for all present and future humanity.” This week’s sequel aims to break the chains of delusion that hold the people of the United Kingdom in thrall to the mindset of a Brutish Em - pire; but if they refuse to break, it is nonetheless necessary that the rest of us comprehend that Anglo-Dutch Liberalism has seized hold of our minds as well, and is drawing us toward a planetary new dark age. La - Rouche discusses this from the basic ontological standpoint: What is man? He also presents the crucial issues of scientific and economic practice, pointing to the solutions required to avert the global crisis which is even now upon us. Elsewhere in this issue, Helga Zepp-LaRouche and her collabora - tors point to the strategic threat posed by the march of fascism in both the United States and Europe—notably the EU’s Lisbon Treaty. There is resistance to it, which must grow quickly. In International , we report the Brutish Empire’s drive to spread war and chaos around the world, so that the London-based financier oligarchy can maintain its political power, as the financial crash proceeds. And in National , there is good news! Hillary Clinton’s success in the March 4 primaries opens new opportunities to derail the plan to install the fascist Michael Bloomberg in the White House; while the LaRouche Youth Movement’s organiz - ing for a Homeowners and Bank Protection Act has achieved new vic - tories. Next week, we’ll feature LaRouche’s March 12 webcast, which will be archived in video at www.larouchepac.com. Don’t miss it!

Thus, Britain’s only chance of surviving, not as an empire, but as a mere na - tion, would be to choose to accept the defeat of Shelburne’s imperial dreams, as it should have accepted this fate no later than the close of World War II: a defeat of its present imperial commitment to a suppression of the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. 1 Bertrand Russell wrote in 1953: “A s for public life, when I first became politically conscious, Gladstone and Disraeli still confronted each other amid Victorian solidities, the British empire appeared eternal, a threat to British naval power was unthinkable, the country was aristocratic, rich and growing richer. . . . For an old man, with such a background, it is dif - ficult to feel at home in a world of . . . American supremacy. ” 2 Bertrand Russell, the accomplice, and sometime rival of the avowed fascist H.G. Wells, \u0004 had spent his public life in furthering a British imperial commitment to 1. The February 176 \u0004 Peace of Paris had already established the British East India Company as a British- empire-in-fact. The late, evil Tony Blair government was not merely the author of the fraud used to launch the currently running Iraq War, but led the effort to crush the Peace of Westphalia out of existence. 2.

Now, Russell, like Wells, is dead, but their com - mon devotion to that wicked intention is very much alive, not only in the United Kingdom, but among all too many brazen influentials met among the nominal citizens of our own United States today. Worse, the current trend in thinking among London’s al - lies in that wicked intention, is as the wicked New York City Mayor Bloomberg and his accomplices have proposed, the “globalized,” neo-malthusian break-up of all of the world’s present nation-states, using a form of political society cast in the self-doomed model of medieval Venice’s organization of that Lombard League of city-based banking power which crashed in Europe’s Fourteenth Century. The latter, medieval system which crashed in the Fourteenth-Century, was the in - famous “new dark age” which began, like the threatened out - break of a “new dark age” today, when one of those Italian cities’ Lombard banks, Lucca’s House of Bardi, set off a chain-reaction, that great wave of doom, which plunged all of Europe into a “New Dark Age.” It was a catastrophe in which half the parishes of Europe vanished from the map, and the population shrank by about one-third during a short tector and friend of Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fas - cists. interval of a few decades. \u0018 In sharp contrast to those medieval models, over the course of President Franklin Roosevelt’s 19 \u0004\u0004 -19 \u00185 Presi - dency, the U.S.A. rose from a deep economic and moral de - pression, to become the most powerful economy and mili - tary power the world had known. Yet, still, despite that lesson from recent experience, a ruined British Empire, at the close of World War II, remained determined that, as both Win - ston Churchill and Bertrand Russell had vowed, Franklin Roosevelt’s victory would be - come no more than the tempo - rary triumph of our U.S.A. over the British Empire. The British imperialists aimed to bring about a ruin of U.S.A. world leadership, which the British empire intended should not last for much more than another full, post-war generation. If in only a certain degree, the Brit - ish were successful in bringing on their intended evil. So, through the complicity of President Harry Truman in furthering imperialist Churchill’s anti-FDR intentions, U.S. power began to slip away, as from the time of the 196 \u0004 assas - sination of a U.S. President, John F. Kennedy, and, beyond that, through the ruinous, decade-long U.S. war in Indo-China which that assassination made possible. Thus, from 1968- 1971 on, the U.S. economy and political system have been falling, more and more, into the hands of our avowed, old en - emy, that vengeful old imperialism of the Anglo-Dutch Lib - eral financier oligarchy, an oligarchy which is centered, at least officially so, in the City of London and the associated British monarchy. \u0018. The original form of what became known as modern fascism, called “cor - poratism,” was actually organized under Italy’s Benito Mussolini, organized by Venetian bankers such as British agent Volpi di Misurata, along the same lines as those of the Fourteenth-Century Lombard League. Typical of this model for today, is the present program of fascist banker Felix Rohatyn and the cabal organized around Mayor Bloomberg by the Rockefeller Founda - tion, together with the son of a Nazi, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is today’s Governor of California, and Governor Rendell of Pennsylvania. Behind this present revival of the old Venetian model of financier leagues of cities, is the same Felix Rohatyn who figured, together with George Shultz, in backing that Pinochet dictatorship of Chile which is also notorious for its role in that Nazi-mass-murder operation of the early 1970s known as “Operation Con - dor.” National Archives British imperialists, like Winston Churchill, shown here (right) at the 1943 Casablanca conference with President Franklin Roosevelt, “aimed to bring about, a ruin of U.S.A. world leadership which the British empire intended should not last for much more than another full, post-war generation,” LaRouche writes. “If in only a certain degree, the British were sucessful in bringing on their intended evil.”"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"6 Feature EIR March 1\u0018, 2008 Thus, to a large degree, beginning with President Tru - man’s ruinous policies, the British Empire has appeared to have succeeded, as if inch-by-inch, in its decades-long, post- 19\u0018\u0018 intention. So, as an Athens was misled toward virtual doom by its Sophists during the time of Pericles, the British empire has sought to employ the corrosive influence of a form of increasingly radical sophistry spread among our leading political and other relevant institutions, and also the population generally, as the means for bringing down the U.S. economy and U.S. political influence world-wide. 5 Yet, despite Truman’s globally crucial strategic accom - modations to the U.S.A.’s avowed imperialist enemies from old Europe, we remained a growing economy until about 1968, as the successful adoption of the manned Moon- Landing project attests. Up to about 1967-68, President Kennedy’s leadership had shown that, despite the system - atic undermining of our American tradition during the 19 \u00185- 1968 interval, the post-FDR design of the U.S. economic system itself had remained inherently strong in its potential for a morally driven, fresh recovery, but this option re - mained, if only until the eruption of a new phase of moral 5.

Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy and the tragic cultural-paradigm which was unleashed by the neo-fascist “left” called “the 68ers.” 6 In such cases of long waves of deca - dence, as such are to be recalled from the examples of the repeated attempts at assas - sination of France’s President Charles de Gaulle, the orchestrated scandal which oust - ed Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in Britain, and the assassination of President Kennedy, it is not the assassinations and kindred ousters of leading figures which are the roots of an ensured moral disaster; but, rather, as in the failure to properly punish Prime Minister Tony Blair, and also in the case of the current Bush Presidency’s crimi - nality, the worst disasters are fostered by post facto complicity of those leading cir - cles, such as Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s fascist Felix Rohatyn, which cover up the actual authorship of such mass murderous crimes, as in the launching of a new Iraq war through the outright, aggravated, official lying so lavishly condoned by the current U.S. Speaker of the House. When both official - dom and the general public consent to such after-the-fact complicity in such moral in - difference to great matters of truth, the political process of government and electorate alike become polluted, more by their own complicity after the fact, than by even the preced - ing, relevant terrible act itself. So, over the course of three subsequent, post-1968 U.S. Presidencies, Nixon, Ford, and Carter (1969-1981), the most essential policy elements of U.S. physical-economic strength were destroyed. The U.S.’s reliance on the Bretton Woods, fixed-exchange-rate, monetary system was shattered, treason - ously, under President Nixon; and, the essential elements of a sane and sound physical economy were shattered and smashed under the Carter Administration’s control by the wrecking ac - tions of an implicitly treasonous Trilateral Commission’s 1970s program of “controlled disintegration” of the U.S. economy.

A Sick World System Over the course of the recent three-and-a-half decades, I have, often, publicly addressed numerous aspects of the sub - ject of the presently accelerating, global threat to our deca - dent world civilization as a whole. This, I have identified, repeatedly, as a threat radiating chiefly from the influence of the Anglo-Dutch Liberal, neo-Venetian, Sarpian (i.e. Paolo Sarpi) system of finance-imperialism (otherwise known as the hoax of free trade). 9 Here, in what I write here and now, I put my earlier published treatments of those subjects on a nearby shelf, where they remain constantly available on the record, to be recalled when they are of needed relevance for some occasion of today and beyond. I impose this limitation on my subject here, so that I might now concentrate the readers’ attention narrowly, here, on the subject of the specific, systemic effects of that ultimately de - cisive aspect of the intellectual failure, in economics, by virtu - ally all among today’s official and other leading specialists in the shaping of our republic’s financial and economic policies. These are the policies whose effects include the current cases of both the U.S. Treasury Secretary and Chairman of the Fed - eral Reserve System, for example, failed officials whose re - cent spurts of hyper-inflationary madness show them as being demonstrably, pathetically incompetent in matters of national economy. What I have to report on those accounts, in this present location, is a matter of what are, presently, the rarely known, fundamental principles of a science of physical economy. This must also include the rare, but, nonetheless, essential subject of what I must also emphasize as the importance of a related expression of the same Classical Principle of Tragedy shown by the works of Aeschylus, Shakespeare, and Friedrich Schiller. Economic processes are not merely things which happen; they are chiefly the result of what the often errant will of people, either high or low in rank, have caused to happen. Thus, “the people factor” in economy reigns today, chiefly, as a principle of tragedy, a type of principle of which most of today’s existentialist and other philosophically reductionist types of supposed academic and other specialists in the sub - ject of drama, are, actually, pathetically ignorant. That is to say, that the subject of a true Classical tragedy, as tragedies by those whom I have just referenced as masters of the drama typify the case, is a society, such as the real-life society which was the setting of Friedrich Schiller’s Wallen - 8. As Shakespeare wrote in The Tragedy of Julius Caesar : “The fault, dear Brutus, lies not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings.” 9. Paolo Sarpi, the leading figure in the late Sixteenth-Century launching of that New Venetian party which founded modern European Liberalism, and from which Anglo-Dutch Liberal imperialism developed. stein Trilogy, for which that particular drama presents an ac - tual case of a society which was inherently doomed by its adherence to what virtually influential strata of the subject society regarded as the culture which they assumed it was their principled, if foolish commitment to defend. It was loy - alty to their foolish oaths which doomed them. The real-life Wallenstein, like that of Schiller’s Trilogy, came to realize that he must betray the evil Habsburg rulers; but, as playwright and historian Schiller emphasizes, Wallen - stein, both in real life, and in the drama, could not conceive of the needed remedy which lay only beyond the bounds of his perceived tradition. A tragic society, such as the real-life Europe of the actual Wallenstein’s wars, is doomed by what its ruling bodies of generally ruling opinion have come to accept as the limited as - sortments of those axiomatic-like principles, or even mere habits of conduct, which they have come to regard as a set of generally accepted customs. Shakespeare’s Hamlet is an ex - ample of such a type of society which is doomed by what it has either inherited, or recently adopted as the moral boundar - ies within which its ruling culture must roam, even if that means the fatal choice which Shakespeare’s Hamlet made. Thus, it was the character Hamlet’s limitation of his out - look to the confines of the culture of the people of Hamlet’s Denmark of that time, which, as Shakespeare demonstrated, was a culture already self-doomed by its own nature, at that time: a habituated impulse for self-inflicted doom from which Shakespeare’s Hamlet refused to break free, a doom which he embraced, thus, as the awful fate, the awful culture from which he refused to change. The wanted change in that soci - ety’s culture, was, so to speak, as in the fatal quality of the ultimately doomed in Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar , “Greek” to Hamlet. Such, precisely, has been the tragic failure menacing the continued existence of our U.S.A.—and the world at large— at the moment of the present U.S. pre-Presidential election- campaign. It is essential to recognize, in this way, that the root of the principal long-ranging failures of nations’ economic policies, is located in the same principle of systemic moral error identi - fied, as warnings, in the best examples of European Classical tragedy. Thus, for example, a competent practice of economics as physical science, shows that any society which has adopted “free trade” as a standard of public behavior, has thereby ad - opted all the inherent characteristics of a culture which is now doomed, so far, to be efficiently destroyed by no other re - quired means than by relevant, ingrained cultural habits of its own people. The distinguishing difference among such sun - dry varieties of such fools, is, essentially: all are ultimately like political cannibals at heart, but, some such fools are eaten sooner, and others later. In the present case of the British Em - pire today, all of Britain’s victims, the Americans and the Eu - ropeans, and Britain itself, would be consumed by their own"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"8 Feature EIR March 1\u0018, 2008 intentions more or less simultaneously—unless they make the needed changes from their presently habituated, prevailing habits in making their opinions. That is the type of the tragedy which grips the leading in - stitutions of government and popular opinion of a virtually doomed U.S.A. today. It also dooms, especially, the relevant predatory fellows who, like New York City’s avowedly fascist (i.e., “corporatist”) Mayor Bloomberg and filthy Felix “ppp” Rohatyn, are working to destroy our republic. These sundry varieties of fascist, or fascistic malefactors typify the same Anglo-Dutch Liberal cabal which put the dictators Mussolini and Hitler into power: which they did for the purpose of car - rying out the tragedy which was the way the post-war peace was ordered intentionally in the proceedings at post-World War I Versailles. That was the exact same kind of tragedy which has, now, been ripened to the point of revealing itself as having been the diabolically malicious intention of that crimi - nally insane policy authored by the Thatcher-Mitterrand, Maastricht decree. Maastricht was a “Versailles II” Treaty: the agreement which the wicked Mrs. Thatcher’s British Em - pire demanded, in her expressed intention to destroy the econ - omy of a reunited Germany. 10 That much said as preface; now, turn to the technical meat of the matter. 10. Beginning the Autumn of 1977, I began investigations intended to define scientific-technical and related political measures which might effectively reduce the continuing threat of a thermonuclear exchange among principal military powers, a threat which was significantly increased by the inaugura - tion of a U.S. Carter government assembled around National Security Advi - sor Zbigniew Brzezinski’s Trilateral Commission. I proposed such a policy as a plank of my U.S. Presidential pre-candidacy in the Summer of 1979. A team at a high level within the new Reagan Administration, provided supervision on behalf of that President, for my exploratory discussion of my proposed policy with the Soviet government. The President announced the policy in a March 2\u0004, 198 \u0004 five-minute segment of his live television broadcast. The So - viet General Secretary turned the offer down flat. His Soviet successor, Gor - bachev, grew very nasty, especially against me personally, over this matter. The fiercest aspect of the fraudulent legal and related Anglo-American ha - rassment against me personally, and against my associates, was launched in the immediate weeks following that broadcast. This is the heart of the con - tinuing “heat” around the name “LaRouche,” still to the present day. I warned in 198 \u0004, that the Soviet refusal to negotiate President Reagan’s offer meant that the Soviet system would collapse “in about five years.” A little more than five years later, in an October 12, 1988 broadcast from Berlin, I announced the impending months collapse of the economies of the Comecon, to begin within Poland. At that time I identified a constructive offer which the U.S.A. should extend to the Soviet government under those conditions. When we compare my alternative, presented thus on October 12,1988, with what Pres - ident George H.W. Bush and Prime Minister Thatcher did to Russia et al., there is no mystery as to why I was railroaded, by a fully transparent judicial hoax, into prison, that at approximately the exact-same moment George H.W. Bush was inaugurated. Beginning 1989, Germany, under the British imperial policy to become known as Maastricht today, is being given the same kind of treatment by Britain, that Britain had heaped on the Germany of the early 1920s. 1. Money Versus Value The potentially fatal intellectual and moral flaw in the thinking of the majority among the currently influential stra - tum of the U.S. population, has been its fanatical, monetarist’s obsession, its delusion, that money as such is an efficient mea - sure of economic value. So, looking more broadly, over the passage of longer times and wider places, the essential, potentially fatal error which standard financial accounting practice makes when it pretends to be the basis for shaping economic policies, is that accounting practice, like financial dogma generally, is essen - tially digital by definition, and is implicitly Cartesian; where - as, the principles of competent economic practice, which re - ject the delusions inhering in the accounting model, are not statistical, but are dynamic , and belong to a category of a spe - cific quality of non-statistical, dynamic, non-linear, “analog” functions. 11 A sane government’s monetary policy, such as that crafted under the leadership of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamil - ton, Henry C. Carey, and President Franklin Roosevelt, is what is recognized by terms such as “protectionist,” or “fair trade.” Government regulation must manage relative pricing within ranges which correspond to the physical effects of such regulatory policies. “Free trade” is an ironical form of consent imposed by the tyrant on the victim who is weak-willed, foolish, or, simply, vulnerable. A proper regulation of tariffs, credit, and pricing, is an absolute necessity for the health of an economy of a free people. “Free trade” is often a name for the looting of the un - protected. The essential conceptions of any competent view of mod - ern economy, which must inform the indicated matters of policy shaping by and among sovereign nations, are rooted in a rigorously crafted certainty of the existence of an abso - lute, categorical distinction of the human species from all lower forms of life. Therefore, the human standard of value can only be one which takes efficiently into account Gene - sis 1’s categorical distinction of man and woman from low - er forms of life. The notion of value must be in agreement with the significance of that power of human reason which enables man to change the ordering of developments, in - cluding increases in mankind’s potential relative popula - tion-density, within the universe which he inhabits. In fact, man accomplishes this needed quality of succes - 11. For an introduction to the principles which underlie a competent eco - nomic thinking, see my “On Monadology,” EIR , Feb. 22, 2008.

That distinction, between beast and human, is shown clearly only in those manifestations, such as the effect of sci - entific potential in effecting the increase of the potential rela - tive population-density of the human species , an increase which correlates with humanity’s specific distinctions of su - periority, as a species, over all other forms of life. This stan - dard must be emphasized as representing an absolute.

The Promethean ‘Model’ As I have repeatedly emphasized throughout my adoles - cent and adult life, that since the moment I rejected the a priori characteristics of the Euclidean geometry as, intrinsi - cally, a specifically Sophist form of systemic incompe - tence, 1\u0004 we must, therefore, then recognize, that the proper, absolute distinction of the human being from all other forms of life, is located in those specifically creative powers of the human intellect which were banned from human practice by the Olympian Zeus of Aeschylus’ Prometheus Bound . This specific Olympian quality of incompetence which I de - nounce here, is one which is typified by that ancient, medi - eval, and modern form of Sophistry, which has assumed a special form of expression in its modern role as the central role of Cartesian and similarly aprioristic methods, such as these are encountered in the prevalent forms of customary, axiomatic assumptions of the modern world’s widely ac - cepted teaching of what is called “science,” or, worse, the functionally psychotic, contemporary neo-malthusianism rampant among the so-called “environmentalists” of our “Baby Boomer” generation. There exist sundry, theological and other objections to the presentation of a “Promethean Model.” Competent science shows these objections to be either false axiomatically, or the 12. See Lyndon H.

I explain the crucial point of dis - tinction as follows. As I have emphasized in locations such as my Monadol - ogy , 15 the key to man’s origins and essential nature is stated, poetically, in Genesis 1. Mankind is set apart from the beasts by special powers which present man to us as in a certain likeness to the Creator of the universe. These are of the type of the powers which include what are known to competently educated minds as discoverable universal physical princi - ples. The modern precedent for the defining of such princi - ples, was Kepler’s uniquely original discovery of the princi - ples of universal gravitation. Unfortunately, the actual discovery of gravitation, by Kepler, is, presently, chiefly ei - 15.

That is especially so in a world which is dominated by the radical extremes of today’s morally corrupting influences of the present adult generations’ extremely decadent, “post-industrial” form of what is identified historically as Anglo-Dutch Liberalism. 16 The most convenient summation of the point just made here, is that view of the implications of the work of Bernhard Riemann adopted by the greatest among the Twentieth- Century scientists, such as Academician V.I. Vernadsky and Albert Einstein, who provided clarity for the use of any mind informed by the distinct meaning of the term “universal phys - ical principles.” These are principles as that term refers to what was understood by the ancient Pythagoreans, by Plato, and by Nicholas of Cusa, Johannes Kepler, and Gottfried Leibniz, which Riemann and such followers as these have provided. On the contrary side, actual knowledge of this Rieman - nian notion of universal physical principles, does not pres - ently exist in the practice among most of the present gen - eration of scientists, scientists whose capacities for clear thinking about such more profound matters have been vir - tually destroyed by the intended quality of influence of the radically reductionist dogmas of followers of the Ockham - ite irrationalist Paolo Sarpi and his empiricist, positivist, and existentialist followers, especially among the devo - tees of the relatively more depraved “post-industrial” ide - ologies of empiricism, positivism, and existentialism of today. Not only did the Philosophical Liberalism of Sarpi et al., prohibit the use of the notion of actual universal physical principles, under the prevalent rules for contemporary re - 16. For precision, the following definition of “Anglo-Dutch Liberalism” must be provided in the form of an extended footnote. The proper, precise meaning of the term “Liberalism,” as employed here, refers to the axiomat - ic-like change in Venetian dogma which occurred in the form of the action, by Paolo Sarpi, the putative founder of what is called the “New Venetian Party,” in adopting the irrationalist dogma of the medieval William of Ock - ham (Latinized: “Occam”). Sarpi’s essential argument was that the Aristote - lean baggage of the old Venetian system would not permit Venetian interests to adopt the improved measures of armed and related combat needed to de - feat the rising potentials which had been unleashed by the great reform launched as the 1\u0018\u00049 A.D. Council of Florence (i.e., of Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa, et al.), unless the New Venice party allowed a practice of innovation which would be intrinsically contrary to the inherent, pro-Aristotelean stag - nation of medieval feudalism. Sarpi’s rise to power coincided with his New Venetian Party’s shift of its economic base of strategic, supporting maritime economic power from the Adriatic to the natural maritime regions of the North Sea, Atlantic, and Baltic. Thus, a Sarpian “New Venetian” maritime power, was concentrated in the Netherlands and along other coastal regions of northern Europe, up to the point of William of Orange’s coup d’etat in England. The power of imperialism does not spring from the interior of political-economies, but from financier-oligarchical modes in maritime power.

This distinct power of mankind resides in the sovereign, miraculous capabilities of the individual human mind: what are efficiently identified as the “creative powers” of that mind, using the term “creative” as congruent with anti-entropy . Essentially, those “creative powers” are typified by the discovery of universal physical principles, as the Pythagore - ans and Plato recognized this, and as Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa launched the uniquely competent modes in modern, cre - ative (i.e., anti-entropic) European science and Classical art, through his re-discovery of the remedy (the notion of the “on - tologically infinitesimal”) for the crucial systemic error in Ar - chimedes’ claim to have defined the generation of the circle by quadrature. It was Kepler who gave those discoveries by Cusa their realization as universals of scientific thought, as expressed most clearly through Kepler’s unique two principal discoveries in astrophysics. 17 It was Albert Einstein, looking backwards, who recog - nized the significance of the role of Cusa’s and Kepler’s notion of the ontologically infinitesimal , by tracing the concept of a “finite, but unbounded universe” to roots in the work of Kepler, and by defining modern physical sci - ence in terms of the process of development of such a con - ception of the universe, as a whole, in those terms of refer - ence. It is that course of development, launched by the work of Cusa’s great follower Johannes Kepler, which is the im - plied bench-mark of reference for measuring value in mod - ern economy. The specific role of Vernadsky, relative to Einstein’s state - ment on the importance of Kepler’s work, is to be recognized in the way in which Vernadsky defined the physical-chemical universality of the biophysical phase-spaces of the Biosphere and Noösphere, respectively. His discovery on these accounts affords us a crucially important insight into the way in which the concept of the Kepler-Riemann universe seen by Einstein must be approached by us today. 18 As I have emphasized in my report of my experience with 17. Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr., “On Monadology,” Op. cit. 18.

Therefore, among Europe - an culture’s examples of scientific opposition to Sophistry, as in the tradition of the Pythagoreans and Plato, human knowl - edge, especially scientific knowledge, is premised chiefly upon conclusive demonstration of the fallacies inherent in be - lief in sense-certainty. For example, a former associate of mine, from more than a quarter-century past, called my attention then to the extant proof of Philo of Alexandria’s refutation of syllogistic Aris - totelean theological dogma, a proof entirely consistent with the astrophysics ( Sphaerics ) of the Pythagoreans. Briefly, the Sophist form of reductionist’s argument used by those Aris - toteleans, was that if the universe is perfect, then God Him - self could not have changed anything essential once the uni - verse had been set into motion as created: essentially, this was the model for the later Sophistry of the hoaxster Claudi - us Ptolemy. 19 The same principled fallacy persists today within the com - mon teaching of science, and in kindred precincts, as in the expressed, reductionist views, such as those of the modern Cartesians and their mimics, which, contrary to the famous principle of Heracleitus, and contrary to the case presented by Plato’s Parmenides , separate existence, ontologically, from motion. When that error is corrected, the error of separating the ontological notion of being from the motion of a process of qualitative self-development, the hero of mankind called Prometheus, in effect, is thus unbound, as Heracleitus’ fa - mous aphorism suggests. The result of recognizing this need - ed correction, is expressed as the concept of universal anti- entropy (contrary to the hoax of a so-called “second law of thermodynamics”) . This is the concept represented by Nich - olas of Cusa’s founding of all valid currents of modern Euro - pean science through his rejection of Archimedes’ notion of the quadrature of the circle; this is the concept underlying all valid claims to progress in not only the properly intended practice of modern science, but progress in realizing that in - tended role of man and woman in society which is implicit in Genesis 1. 19. Notably, both Copernicus and Tycho Brahe, who recognized a formal fallacy in Claudius Ptolemy’s hoax, failed to define a principled form of organization of regular action in the Solar System, where Kepler succeed - ed in discovering the principle of gravitation. The method employed by Kepler for his unique success is the same method of Sphaerics represented by the Pythagorean Archytas’ construction of the duplication of the cube, as Eratosthenes emphasized the significance for all science of that con - struction by Archytas. The same issue was posed implicitly by the success of Leibniz and Bernouilli, as contrasted with the frauds on the subject of the ontologically infinitesimal by de Moivre, D’Alembert, Euler, La - grange, et al. 2. Creativity As Universal Motion As I have emphasized in my recent, earlier report on the lesson to be taken from the Monadology , 20 the idea of a uni - versal physical principle, is the notion of not merely an ac - tive, but a universally acting principle , whose own actual ex - istence is external to sense-perception as such, but whose existence, expressed by effects, as being exactly such a uni - versal principle, is effectively demonstrable empirically (e.g., experimentally) through methods sometimes identified by professionals as “crucial experiments,” or better named either “unique” or “universal” experiments. The most impor - tant of the latter type of cases include the illustration given by Kepler’s presentation of universal gravitation; that is, not only as a principle as such, but as that principle entirely un - derlying that organization of the Solar System in a physical space-time which is beyond the controlling, direct reach of, for example, either the assumed visual or auditory fields. 21 The more exact method for definition of universal evidence, cohering with that of Kepler, is supplied as Riemann’s notion of “unique experiments.” As I have emphasized in that earlier report, if we limit the significance of the concept “universal” to a merely spa - tial quality of an instantaneous existence, as might be im - plied by the notion of a naively defined space-time such as that of a student’s Euclidean geometry, or, as Leonhard Eul - er erred in his ontologically fraudulent attack on Leibniz’s concept of “infinitesimal,” we could fail to come up to that level of Einstein’s famous defense of Johannes Kepler’s unique achievements respecting the founding of a practi - cally universal modality for modern experimental science thus far. 22 The crucial point here, is that the essence of all competent scientific thought, whether as physical science, or in the coun - terpoint of Johann Sebastian Bach, is located in motion, or, as conductor-composer Wilhelm Furtwängler stressed the same principle with extraordinary excellence in practice, a science of rubato 23 in the broader and deeper meaning of his manifest applications of the conception of the Pythagorean comma , as “between the notes.” Truth in science is not what is perceived; it is what is truthfully demonstrated to be a process of becom - ing, as Einstein echoed Heracleitus and Plato for physical sci - ence generally, as in his own defense of Kepler’s unique role in all competent modern science. 2\u0018 20.

The relevant act of a quality of de - fining experimental discovery, must be experienced as dem - onstrating a certain efficiency of a quality of existence, a qual - ity of existence demonstrated to be operating as if “from outside” the domain of mere deductive-inductive abstractions from ordinary sense-perceptions. Principles of Experiment Thus, no actually existing universal physical principle could ever be competently demonstrated by a design of ex - periment which pretends, as empiricism does, to locate what is actual within axiomatic ontological presumptions adduced from naive sense-perception, as Euclid and Descartes did, for example. Select the case of Cartesian method to illustrate this point. Cartesian analytic geometry proceeds from the assumed physical existence of a set of quasi-Euclidean, a-priori no - tions of space and time. This presumption of Descartes was demonstrated to lead, inevitably, to what Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated to have been an arbitrary absurdity; 25 this demonstration was the pivotal experimental evidence against the absurdity of Cartesian geometry, which was em - ployed by Leibniz to revive the experimental physical prin - ciple of dynamics ( dynamis ) from its ancient origin in the legacy of Pythagorean Sphaerics and Plato. Leibniz viewed this demonstration of a fundamental fallacy in all empiricist method (such as that of Descartes) as a demonstration which served as a kind of launching-pad for developing his (and Jean Bernouilli’s) work in showing the general physical im - plications of the related notion of Fermat’s principle of “least time.” The result was that Leibniz-Bernouilli concept of universal physical least-action, which is the original cru - cial proof, within modern science of the Riemann-Einstein tradition, of the need to dump the false axiomatic assump - tions of digital methods in favor of what are termed “analog” methods. 26 The fallacy inherent in all empiricist and related method, is an expression of the same essential Sophistry traced as a systemic error from Aristotle to Euclid, and from Aristotle and Euclid to Claudius Ptolemy’s hoax. In all of these and re - lated cases, it is assumed that the real universe is the universe of sense-certainty as misdefined by extension, for the very “becoming,” an achievement by him which is expressed as the underlying intention of all truly great Classical musical compositions since J.S. Bach. 25. Specimen Dynamicum , in Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz: Philosophical Papers, L.E. Loemker, trans. ed. (Dordrecht, Boston, London: Kluwer Aca - demic Publishers, 1976, second edition). 26. Cf.

What Leibniz represented in that refutation of Descartes et al., echoed the earlier discovery of the same quality of prop - er meaning of the term “truth,” as in the experience which, like Kepler’s discovery of the ontologically infinitesimal lo - cal action of gravitation, demonstrates the existence of an ef - ficient principle which is acting from beyond the domain of sense-perceptual notions as such. Kepler had demonstrated that we must not attempt to derive universal physical princi - ples from a naively aprioristic geometry, but must define physical geometry from the standpoint of relevant, crucial- experimental demonstrations of what the cognitive powers of our mind must discover to be the physical principles, contrary to sense-certainty, which define the physical geometry of ef - ficient space with regard for the implications of both the very large and very small. 28 A rigorous sense of the failures implicit in apparent lim - its of apparent sense-perceptual certainties, is a precondi - tion, as by continuing a Riemannian process of elimination, for defining the efficient existence of principles of action, such as universal gravitation as discovered by Kepler, which are operating from outside the repertoire of what might be explained as effects of explicitly sense-perceptible actualities. The paradoxes to which I have thus referred, should al - ready have become clearer to us, through experimental pene - tration into the evidence of experimental knowledge of the atomic and sub-atomic domains, at the one extreme, and as to the higher astrophysical scale, on the other. In these domains we can no longer rely on the simple evidence of our sense- perceptual apparatus; we require the design of instruments, instruments which, since they must remind us of the functions of our naturally supplied senses, and thus serve as surrogates for our sense-perceptual powers, warn us that a naive estima - tion of our given powers of sense-perception also suffers a tendency to promote erroneous, axiomatic, or axiomatic-like presumptions; this should, therefore, warn us against a popu - lar tendency for fallibility in the way we tend to think about defining our natural or synthetic perceptual experiences, re - spectively. So, now, proceed from those remarks, to treat some rele - vant higher considerations. Prototypes of what I had just stated, include the identi - fication of the specific form of dynamic distinction of the physical geometry of living chemistries from non-living ones, that in a way which defines a physical-chemical defi - nition of a principle of life per se operating from outside the 28. For example, only a kind of utter, ideologically driven incompetence, could have impelled the devotees of the wild-eyed Sophist Ernst Mach into attributing the apparent form of organization of visible objects in sense- perceptual space to the ontology of a sub-atomic, microphysical domain. functional capacities of what are otherwise experimentally known as the ordinary physical-chemical domain. Or, simi - larly, the efficiently practical proof of the uniqueness of hu - man creative powers, and their relevant physical geome - tries, as experimentally distinct, on principle, from anything extant among lower forms of life. These distinctions arise in experimental methods of investigation, but arise only through attention to the implications of the concept of the ontological specificity of the Leibniz infinitesimal, as op - posed to the explicitly fraudulent denial of the evidence of the ontologically infinitesimal by reductionist ideologues such as de Moivre, D’Alembert, Euler, Lagrange, Laplace, and Cauchy. 29 Therefore, it is of crucial importance that we recognize the fraudulent character of the typical arguments of followers of Sarpi’s dogma, such as Galileo, Descartes, de Moivre, Eul - er, Cauchy, Clausius, Grassmann, Helmholtz, et al., as typi - cally symptoms of the role of Ockham’s irrationalism when expressed, typically, for modern society in the form of em - piricism, positivism, contemporary monetarist ideology, and the radically deconstructionist methods of the existentialists. All of these bounding considerations which I have just summarized in the preceding paragraphs, come into focus in defining economy as implicitly defining a physical economy which is expressed as the function of a process of discovery of universal physical principles which is unique to specifically human practice . Thus, a science of physical economy, as I have defined this for what have been my uniquely successful methods for long-range economic forecasting, corresponds to the presently highest known standpoint of physical science in general. My Experience Conversely, the comprehension of the actual, physical principles of economy could not have been discovered in any different way than the way in which I developed my own orig - inal insights into the principles of economy, through the im - plications of my own, ostensibly spontaneous recognition of the inherent fraud of what was presented to me as a Euclidean geometry. The most essential pre-condition for scientific thinking, in this case of my experience and similar cases, pertains to the desire to avoid those conclusions respecting our knowledge of the universe, the which ignore that qualitative distinction be - tween human knowledge, on the one side, and the different kind of experience of the universe, on the other side, expressed by the species-reproductive modalities of lower forms of life. Therefore, the only competent premises for any branch of physical science , are those specific to the design based on ex - perience of mankind’s willful accomplishment of a willfully 29.

This is not limited to one’s own nation; the very principle of dynamics itself, shows that the failure to raise the level of potential relative population-density of any section of humanity, has a depressing effect on what would be otherwise the increase of the potential of those portions of humanity which are progressing, relatively, in other ways; real econom - ic processes are globally (i.e., universally) physically dynam - ic , not Cartesian.

Sumer, Women & History Humanity is the only living species which is capable of a willful mode of progressive ordering of the increase of its spe - cies’ potential relative population-density. Once we have ac - cepted the reality, that man and woman are distinguished cat - egorically from all other mammals by the potential creative ( anti-entropic ) intellectual powers specific to the human spe - cies alone, the subject of history is to be recognized as nothing other than the processes of evolution and devolutions of hu - man cultures’ combined scientific and Classical-cultural re - sponse to that Solar System setting from within which hu - manity is operating. From that point on, the subject of the action exerted by that historical process is located, for competent thinkers, as lying principally in the Noösphere, rather than the Bio - sphere. 1.) Life has never come from non-life . 2.) The distinction of human life is located in a principle which belongs to a do - main outside the domain of animal life. In the evolution of our planet, there are three presently known, categorical phases, the pre-biotic , the Biosphere , and the Noösphere . The charac - teristic direction of both our Solar System and the transforma - tion of our planet itself, has been the creation and the increase of the Biosphere, as typi - fied by the generation of a breathable atmosphere and of waters, relative to the non-living, and of the Noö - sphere, relative to the Bio - sphere. On those accounts, there is a relevant lesson for today to be learned, as an example, from inclusion of questions posed by one of the crucial case-studies of the known ancient his - tory of the physical econo - my in the west Asian part of the larger, Mediterannean- centered region within which European civiliza - tion arose. That is the ironi - cal case of the rise and fall of ancient Sumer and other expressions of the cunei - form culture, and the even more profoundly ironical lesson to be learned when we compare that case of ancient through medieval Mesopotamia with a pres - ent-day problem associated with the role which, unfortunate - ly, continues to be assigned, if only implicitly, to women gen - erally, in modern European cultures today. Ancient Sumer’s attributable origins were those of a mar - itime culture expressed in the region of the Indian Ocean, \u00040 one among the examples of the way in which one among the non-Semitic, dominant maritime cultures of the last great, millennial post-glacial melt period had functioned. That cul - ture is best known to us today in its manifestation as a cunei - form culture, a colonization typical of notable lower riparian regions upstream from the mouths of those major rivers which had been left running in the wake of the earlier portions of the great post-glacial melt. From notable archeological studies, amid the available evidence from the relatively earlier portions of this coloni - zation-process, we have the appearance, in this case, of what archeologists have defined as an ancient “bow-tenure system.” In this system’s more respectable phases of exis - tence, the farmers who maintained the irrigation system, and defended it against salination, among other threats, had a positive kind of symbiotic physical-economic relationship \u00040. The role of such Indian-Ocean-based cultural roots is a subject usually related to the radiated influence of Indian Ocean maritime cultural influ - ences. The see-saw pattern of riparian cultural developments and crises, as in the repetition of such patterns of decadence which followed the decline of the great Arab civilization of the Baghdad Caliphate of Harun al- Rashid, has continued throughout Europe, until today.

What appears to have been the original form of this ripar - ian system, underwent crises, crises leading toward the rise and fall of an Akkad which was partly an echo of the cunei - form culture of Sumer, and also continuing what became a subsequent underlying, see-saw pattern of riparian cultural developments and crises, past the rise and fall of the great Baghdad Caliphate of Charlemagne’s ally Haroun Al-Rashid and the latter’s successors. \u00041 There lies a pattern which re - mained evident to the eye of the witting traveler as I spent a couple of days moving by helicopter, up part of the Euphrates north of Baghdad, in April 1975. The essential feature of this pattern itself, had been the re - curring effects of a pattern of cultural degeneration from the equivalent of “bow tenure,” to the equivalent of hired “stoop labor,” to outright slavery, as in the repetition of such patterns of decadence which followed the decline of the great Arab civilization of the Baghdad Caliphate. That pattern, which has continued throughout Europe, still today, through the time of that infamous modern Sophist and organizer of African slav - ery in North America, John Locke, was first made clear for modern students of archeological history, by their considering the long-ranging pattern of the evidence assembled from such beginnings as archeological studies of Sumer. This provides us a demonstration of the otherwise typical effects of a peri - odical eliminating, or virtually eliminating of the role of the willfully creative powers of the individual human mind from the general cultural practice of the relevant society. The modern expression of the effort to suppress the rec - ognition of the creative powers of the human mind, is the so- called philosophical Liberalism introduced to modern Eu - rope by Paolo Sarpi, as his revival of the doctrine of the medieval irrationalism of William of Ockham, a form of modern irrationalism which emerged during the Seventeenth Century in such expressions as empiricism, positivism, and existentialism, all of these under the rubric of the form of ir - rationalism which came to be known as modern Anglo-Dutch Liberalism. Against the background which I have just identified in this present chapter thus far, I refer again, as earlier in this report, to the concept illustrated by Aeschylus’ Prometheus Trilogy , the surviving elements represented by the Prometheus Bound most notably. \u00041. Although Charlemagne received the imperial crown, he was not only an enemy of the Byzantine imperial system of that time, but his achievements were the target of both the Byzantine Empire and its Norman-Venetian suc - cessors through those deaths of the Staufer emperors which paved the way for what was to become the Fourteenth Century’s “New Dark Age.” Peace be - tween France and the Arab states of near Asia, was the mainstream of the dip - lomatic and related policies of Charlemagne and his notable successors through the death of Staufer emperor Frederick II. This was an underlying trend in anti-Norman policy of medieval and modern France, from Louis XI, until Napoleon Bonaparte’s regime reversed it. Women in Recent History Within the range of such historical studies of these and other roots of development of what emerged as European civ - ilization, when that evidence is compared with similar pat - terns in known history generally, we have the not-unrelated case of the long record of relegation of women, of even our own present-day society, to a second-rate intellectual devel - opment, that even in modern European culture, as in the case of the U.S.A. during the Twentieth Century and now: a matter forced to special attention now, at the moment of the presently ongoing U.S. Presidential campaign. The discussion becomes most interesting, and also most controversial, the moment we shift emphasis to a focus of at - tention on the subject of the often relatively degrading, as - signed role of women in what is termed “social work.” I emphasize, thus, the example of a certain kind of “will - ing intellectual slavery,” rooted in the forms of Sophistry as - sociated with the behavioral characteristics of modern radi - cally reductionist dogma and its habits, as found among avowed “feminists” and other “middle class” women in the globally extended European culture of today. I refer to the case in which women are ostensibly upgraded in their acces - sible relative social-status rank in the government of society, but achieve this gain under the frequently implicit condition, that the intellectual and moral condition of women generally, and the feminist of the relatively higher income brackets in particular, may enjoy certain benefits of social change, but usually gain virtually no net intellectual improvement in ac - tual cognitive potential, relative to that of comparably leading cases from earlier generations; rather, the recent trend has come to represent a factor of relative cultural decadence, as in the decline of culture in Europe and the Americas since, espe - cially, 1968. Thus, in the wake of the shift to post-industrial society, a shift against which President John F. Kennedy fought the last few years of his life, the shift into a post-industrial ideology of practice saw women rising in their relative participation in ex - ecutive roles, but also, therefore, sharing in an accelerating decline in the economic culture and general welfare and econ - omy of the nation as a whole. More and more women came to play a relatively more significant role of influence in the man - agement of what was, in net effect, an accelerating cultural degeneration of the society at large. This was, thus, a most ironical, relative advancement of more and more women of the upper through middle income-brackets to an executive role of participation in steering the economy presently toward Hell.

Through methods of acute cultural degeneration of European civilization as a whole (such as the spread of exis - tentialism), the standard of intellectual life in Europe and North America today, for both women and men, has fallen generally to what is relatively an abysmal level, relative to earlier times. Therefore, we must not confuse the issue of currently rela - tive social status, with that of absolute status. Sharing that poverty, or, the effects of the cognitive decadence which has become increasingly widespread in the Americas and Europe today, is not what should be intended as an advancement in “equality.” Rather, it is the distinctions of the human being from all the beasts, distinctions specific to the creative powers expressed by Leibniz’s notion of the ontological infinitesimal, which should be recognized as the absolute issue of political was introduced as a surrogate for the clinically authentic term “psychotomi - metic.” The promotion of this explicitly Luciferian cult was centered in the circles of the same Brigadier John Rawlings Rees of the British official psy - chological warfare organization featured in the establishment of the London Tavistock Clinic, the organization which sponsored the development and pro - motion of LSD. Marijuana of an increased psychedelic potency is included in this repertoire. life today; it is those qualities of the development and expression of the creative powers of the individual human mind, which distinguish man from beast, those creative powers of the human mind which do not exist among the beasts, which must be recognized as the existential quality of the “fighting issues” facing all humanity, still to - day. That case of the relative condi - tion of women, must be compared with the contradictory trends of re - cent decades in both the Americas and Europe. We witness the accel - erating rise of the incomes and in - fluence of our parasitical classes, such as the case of the parasite, New York Mayor Bloomberg, \u0004\u0004 which must be compared to the plummeting standard of living of the majority of our U.S.A. and western European populations since, not only, the early 1970s petroleum-price hoax which made the U.S. dollar a tool of the Euro - pean petro-dollar swindle, but, most notably, under the Y2000 col - lapse under Ayn Rand follower Alan Greenspan’s reign at the Federal Reserve System. Reliance on statistical trend-lines in economics, is intrin - sically incompetence, as the influence of such incompetence of official reporting over the U.S. decades since the assassina - tion of President John F. Kennedy has shown. Competent measurement in economy is not financial-statistical, but phys - ical; it is essentially a matter of physical measurements which must be made according to the principles of Leibnizian (i.e., Riemannian) dynamics , not neo-Cartesian statistical mumbo- jumbo. A pig has what some people might wish to consider “free will;” only human individuals share in common the specific potential creative powers of a Plato, a Nicholas of Cusa, a Dante Alighieri, a Kepler, a Leibniz, or a Beethoven. The rel - evant principle of dynamics is expressed both in terms of (Riemannian) potential relative population-density, and the specific rate of increase (or, decrease) of the characteristic rate of change in relative potential population-density for societies as wholes. \u0004\u0004 . Bloomberg’s identity as essentially a parasite is typified by his scheme for buying up government-created infrastructure at bargain prices, and then looting the public by charging usurious fees for the public’s use of that infra - structure.

Currently, the prevalent idea of a woman in management of a firm of any kind, is usually degraded to some form of the presumption, which might have been borrowed from the French sociologists of notoriously pro-existentialist leanings, such as the utterly decadent European Congress for Cultural Freedom, that the managerial post is intended to be a form of drawing upon the same quality of special, limiting capabili - ties of women for work which is comparable to the set of as - sumptions peculiar to the idea of “social work,” as “social work” is associated with the relevant characteristics of the ex - istentialist academic modalities typical of the types of “Lady- do-rightly” social-work doctrine during the childhood, ado - lescence, and adulthood of the generation born between 19 \u00185 and 1958: not making chairs, but merely re-arranging and decorating them. This is to be compared with a growing, tragi-comic ten - dency, largely by default, to promote men from other employ - ment, to the role of being “mothers” in almost all expressions short of child-bearing, with the consequent presumption that these new, “odd couple” types of “feminized” Don Juans will develop proficiency in “nagging.” As one excellent model of a modern woman I know puts it most aptly: “Intellectually impotent men bring out feelings of aggression in me!” Some women prefer, or even insist upon the type of intellectually impotent male upon which they will tend to chew as on the head of an old-fashioned lead- pencil, or they will be enraged by a male who refuses to coop - erate, submissively, in that intellectually degraded sort of pair-wise social relationship. However, in all of this, the crucial fact to be considered is the role of dynamics. The quality of life in a society is the quality defined by the conditions among all sectors of its pop - ulation. If men were well educated, and women not, the entire society will be dragged down, both physically and intellectu - ally, by the resulting nature of the interaction of men and women generally. If part of the society lives in cruel poverty, the entire culture is morally and otherwise degraded. This principle of dynamics applies not only to men and women, but to the intellectual interrelations among all parts of the culture, as to the relationship between rich and poor alike. That is the tragedy of oligarchical societies, even those maritime cultures which had been, until recently, the leading edge of cultural progress. As the case of examination of the United Kingdom today shows, an advantaged social class, like that of the British, is degraded into decadence by the ef - fects, upon itself, of its attempted oligarchical forms of tyranny practiced upon the intellectually and culturally stultified masses. Therefore, the Monadology Instances of that sort should direct our attention back to both the opening subject of this report, and of my preceding report on the Monadology : the function of individual creativ - ity in society, as I have defined creativity here. At the present moment, concentrate for a time on the role of true creativity in pair-wise and broader social relationships. Acknowledging the all too typical intellectual habits of our times in their own terms, you might be blinded by your own conceits, to the pat that you do not recognize the singular importance of that is - sue; but, after all, it is not the pain we suffer which is the most important of the practical issues we should face; but, rather, what should be crucial for us, is securing the means by which we may locate in ourselves the power to be freed from intoxi - cation with the assorted types of fears and fantasies which, combined, tend to shackle, and stupefy the minds of most of humanity, world-wide, today. Thus, in these terms of reference, the clinical, bench-mark case of ancient Sumer becomes a model benchmark-issue on which to moor our perspective on history’s unfolding devel - opment over millennia leading to the state of affairs of today. This leads our attention to the subject of creativity per se, not merely as a matter of individual potency, but, as the principal, determining point of reference for tracing the evolution, or devolution of the role of dynamic social relationships in shap - ing the course of that span of history up to the present time. That, in turn, guides us to insight into the self-inflicted, now onrushing destruction of the British empire today. The ultimate origin of all true progress in both the in - crease, and even the maintenance of the potential relative population-density of a society, depends upon the role of what are actually the anti-entropic, ontological characteris - tics of relative qualities of expression of potential individual human creative mental activity, that in the roles of both in - creasing the potential relative population-density in a cul - ture, and in resisting the entropy induced by a lack of the ben - eficial effects of such creativity. \u0004\u0018 In the attempt to overcome \u0004\u0018 .

The benefits of these forms of cre - ativity, which are rarely recognized in European culture today, are expressed, chiefly as either discoveries of universal physical principles, in the tradition of Cusa, Kepler, and Leibniz or, similarly, of the applicable implications of such discoveries, or in the form of Classical irony in Classical artistic composition. The standard which defines “progress” in cultural development, is, specifically , a manifest net increase in the potential relative population-density of a society as a whole: a term specific to the concep - tion of dynamics, especially Riemann dynamics . As I have frequently emphasized in my writings, and otherwise, on this and closely related issues of creativity, as dur - ing the past sixty years, the most charac - teristic issue to be treated in any examination of human cul - tures during the just-indicated or much earlier times, is the issue summarily posed by the great Aeschylus’ Prometheus Trilogy , the surviving fragment of that Trilogy, Prometheus Bound , most notably. That is the issue, the issue of that cre - ativity which is essentially the functional distinction of hu - man beings from beasts, a standard which is most typically represented by the conflict of Solon of Athens with that slave- system of Lycurgus’ Sparta which typifies the Delphic origins of the Gaea-Python-Apollo-Dionysus cult associated with the roots of ancient Greek Sophistry. The crucial fact of history implicit in these points which I have introduced in this present chapter thus far, is that there are two absolutely contradictory conceptions of the character - istics of the rise of modern European civilization since its roots in the relatively known history of the “Middle East/ Mediterranean” region. This is a contradiction whose known history can be traced efficiently since a point significantly ear - lier than the birth of what became a specifically European civ - ilization born about the time of an alliance of Egypt with the Etruscans and Ionians against the maritime power of Tyre, ap - proximately 700-600 B.C. This is shown by the examples of the implicitly known work of Thales and Heracleitus, and the echoes of their work in the development of the foundations of known physical sci - ence by the Pythagoreans and the network of Plato. Through that entire interval, since the time of Thales, there is a clear pattern of conflict between two diametrically opposed con - ceptions of the nature of the human species, an opposition which is aptly typified by the real-life historical implications of Aeschylus’ Prometheus Trilogy . This difference between two opposing conceptions of human nature, is the key to the understanding of the crucial issues determining all of the world’s history, now, and for the generations yet to come. The crucial issue underlying all of this, is the notion of the ontologically infinitesimal , a notion already implicit in the work of the Pythagoreans and Plato, which was revived as the basis for modern physical science by Nicholas of Cusa, \u00045 and expressed as the foun - dations of modern scientific progress in the work of Leon - ardo da Vinci, Johannes Kepler, Fermat, and Gottfried Leibniz, and, by Gauss, Riemann, Vernadsky, and Einstein. It is what I have identified as the systemically anti- reductionist physical principle of the ontological infinitesi - mal of the Leibniz-Bernouilli principle of universal physi - \u00045. I.e., the modern conception of the ontologically transfinite was intro - duced by Nicholas of Cusa’s correction of the erroneous assumption specific to Archimedes’ quadrature of the circle and parabola. The first systemic ex - perimental proof of this discovery by Cusa was provided by Johannes Kepler’s demonstration of the principle of “equal areas, equal times.” Kepler’s discovery is the foundation of the method employed by all compe - tent modern physical science, as by Fermat, Leibniz, Gauss, Riemann, Ver - nadsky, and Einstein contrary to the Sophist methods of the empiricists and their like. The Ukrainian-Russian scientist V.I. Vernadsky defined the Noösphere, the realm of cognition, as above and distinct from the Biosphere. “This quality, which distinguishes man fundamentally from beasts, is associated with the principle of specifically human discovery of true universal physical principles,” says LaRouche."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"22 Feature EIR March 1\u0018, 2008 cal least action. This latter is the same principle featured in my On Monadology . \u00046 4. The Monadology & You The ostensibly sociological issue which I have empha - sized in the preceding chapter, and in my earlier paper on Mo - nadology, poses questions of urgent importance for our pres - ently, increasingly calamitous times, social questions which we must refer, for answers, to the domain of Riemannian physical geometry. As I have stressed in locations published earlier, the physical-chemical evidence which was implicitly refer - enced by Academician V.I. Vernadsky in defining the Noö - sphere, locates the efficient expression of the distinction of man from beast in a principle which is necessarily distinct from, in the sense of being categorically “above,” the ele - mentary concept of life as a principle of the Biosphere. This quality which distinguishes man fundamentally from beasts, is associated with the principle of specifically human dis - covery of true universal physical principles, as this notion from the ancient Egyptian and Greek Classical times was re-introduced to modern European civilization by Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa, as in locations such as his founding of modern European science in works beginning with his De Docta Ignorantia . It is this same principle which is expressed by Johannes Kepler in Kepler’s uniquely original discovery of the univer - sal principle of gravitation, and which is at the center of Gott - fried Leibniz’s uniquely original discovery of the calculus of the ontologically infinitesimal . It is the same principle, which owes its more fulsome expression, chiefly, to the anti-Euclid - ean physical geometry of Bernhard Riemann’s 185 \u0018 habilita - tion dissertation. The central feature of the relevant argument which I pres - ent in this present report, depends upon Vernadsky’s proofs in the domain of physical chemistry, crucial proofs of the exis - tence of a principle of life which does not occur within non- living processes. This also demands, that we pin-point the in - dependent universal physical principle which distinguishes the human individual, ontologically, universally, absolutely, from all lower forms of living processes. The relevant argu - ment required for our purposes here and now, goes as fol - lows. There is no competent science of economy which does not rely upon these foregoing foundations of a competent science of economy. To understand the cultural crises which wrack and ruin today’s world as a whole, we must recognize that the notion of Sophistry, which is traceable in European civilization from such ancient sources as the Delphi Apollo-Dionysus \u00046. LaRouche, “On Mondadology,” Op. cit. cult, has been reincarnated essentially in the domination of the cultures of modern European society by the Anglo- Dutch Liberalism whose proximate origin is to be traced to the influence of the founder of the Neo-Venetian political party of Paolo Sarpi, a Liberalism whose influence produced that modern imperial form of Sophistry known as the neo- Venetian phenomena of Anglo-Dutch Liberalism, such as Cartesianism. Economy & Modern Imperialism From its February 176 \u0004 Peace of Paris, which was the occasion of the founding of the actual financial empire of Lord Shelburne’s British East India Company, still operat - ing, if under modified costuming, until today, the British Empire has been essentially a neo-Venetian (Sarpian) form of global maritime empire of a reformed Venetian financier- oligarchical system, a reform based on the revived irrational - ism of the medieval William of Ockham, which thus super - seded the failed Aristotelean doctrine of the old Roman imperial model of Byzantium and of the Crusaders’ medi - eval Venice. The installation of this philosophical standpoint of Anglo-Dutch Liberalism, has created an imperial boundary for development of modern society, a boundary within which it seeks to confine the prospects for continued human exis - tence in that mode. This British imperial boundary imposed upon humanity at large, has been challenged by the develop - ments in North America which, while transferring the best known fruits of modern European culture to the Americas, created an ordering of affairs within North America which was thus significantly, if not perfectly, free from the corrup - tion represented by the neo-Venetian system of Anglo-Dutch Liberalism. For reasons which I shall emphasize in the concluding chapter of this report, the continued role of the neo-Venetian style of financier imperialism represented by the British sys - tem, has imposed its threatened absolute boundary-condition on a civilization which succumbed to a continued hegemony of this British influence. The extension of world history under the inherent reflexes of that British system and its auxiliaries, would tend, strongly, to bring humanity as a whole to a limit at which a general, vastly genocidal breakdown of the present world system would occur: unless we now introduce certain radical changes which would, significantly, prevent that ca - tastrophe. The world has now reached approximately that limit, that verge of a now immediately threatened general, planetary breakdown-crisis. The existence of this kind of now very rapidly approach - ing boundary-condition, was already demonstrated most clearly during the period of President Franklin Roosevelt’s service. It was clear to Roosevelt and to his relevant adversary Winston Churchill, that the success of U.S. leadership in mak - ing possible the defeat of the Hitler regime, defined the imme -"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"March 1\u0018, 2008 EIR Feature 2\u0004 diate preconditions for an inevitable collision between the U.S.A. and British systems, as President Roosevelt stated this frankly, and repeatedly, to Churchill during the course of World War II, and as Churchill’s Britain understood this clear - ly in its own determination to uproot and destroy all of those qualities of the U.S.A.’s constitutional system which had de - fined the absolute superiority of the U.S. system to the British one. Immediately upon President Franklin Roosevelt’s death, President Truman joined Churchill’s cause in the effort to cas - trate and gradually destroy those anti-imperialist characteris - tics of the U.S. constitutional system which Churchill and his confederates hated so devoutly. Later, with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the process of attempting to up - root the Franklin Roosevelt legacy, went from sabotage to in - tentional uprooting and destruction of everything which had made the U.S.A. the great power which had led in the defeat of fascism. What H.G. Wells praised, as he did during the ear - ly 19 \u00040s, as his own, British style in fascism, has taken over, more and more, the cultural trends within the U.S.A. and Eu - rope over the recent decades. So, today, especially under the Bush-Cheney Administra - tion, the U.S.A. has now become virtually self-destroyed, aided, lately, in this by the complicity of such fools as Speak - er of the House Nancy Pelosi, an asset of the perfervidly fas - cist Felix Rohatyn. However, what the resulting, present state of world affairs represents more immediately, is the attempt - ed triumph of the British empire’s program for a model of society which is to be fairly described as a globalized new Tower of Babel. World civilization at large could not long outlive such a mode of collapse of the U.S.A., a collapse which would be, presently, a greater calamity than that which Europe experienced in the middle of its Fourteenth-Century “New Dark Age.” Thus, the triumph of the Anglo-Dutch Lib - eral system at this time, would be the doom of civilization world-wide, a doom expressed in a chain-reaction style of general breakdown crisis of the planet as a whole: that for reasons I shall make clearer in the subsequent, concluding chapter of this report. Those things considered, the question to be addressed is defined broadly as follows. To serve the purposes of the subject which needs to be set forth in this particular report, I must devote the following por - tions of this present chapter of my report to presenting a rele - vant kind of summary form of recapitulation of the arguments on the subject of the physical science of economics which I have published in earlier locations, as follows. I present four categorical arguments to this effect. First: What Is Science? From the relevant known, attributable evidence obtained from ancient until modern sources, science begins where the reign of “sense-certainty” has been brought to a close. The notion of science is, properly, the notion of knowl - edge addressed to specifically universal subject-matters, which means observation of principled changes in the observ - able universe, especially the astronomical universe. Such changes became observable for scientific or related purposes, only under the conditions of use of very long periods of obser - vation of the visible aspects of our surrounding universe, for guiding what had been ancient, long-ranging, often repeated migrations. In fact, for that reason, true scientific knowledge could not come into existence except through the effects of society’s use of celestial navigation as a method for repeated migrations, back and forth, either under the conditions of long-term gla - ciation of large regions of the planet, or comparable circum - stances. “True scientific knowledge could not come into existence except through the effects of society’s use of celestial navigation as a method for repeated migrations, back and forth, either under the conditions of long-term glaciation of large regions of the planet, or comparable circumstances.” Shown here, the Orion constellation, on the celestial equator."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"2\u0018 Feature EIR March 1\u0018, 2008 It is presently known, as since Bernhard Riemann’s refer - ence to this fact in his 185 \u0018 habilitation dissertation, that phe - nomena occurring on a scale corresponding to the atomic and sub-atomic, on the one side, and phenomena on the astronom - ical scale, on the other hand, can not be competently repre - sented by resort to assumed geometries which were based on the ordinary macro-scale’s observations. Thus, anything deserving the name of science, is a matter rooted in celestial navigation, as in the course of regular, prob - ably seasonal migrations over navigable distances of thou - sands of kilometers, that during a span of very many genera - tions. As study of ancient calendars points out to us today, a valid concept of science could have arisen only under such conditions of persisting, long-ranging celestial navigation. From thence, the idea of a true physical science descends to more local earthly activities, until the scientific crisis met on the scale of the atomic and sub-atomic becomes the new qual - ity of challenge to be considered. As I have emphasized repeatedly, earlier in this present report, and many reports uttered by me earlier, any and every attempt to interpret events and processes from the standpoint of a-priori assumptions, such as those of widely taught Eu - clidean Sophistry or kindred presumptions, introduces a cru - cial element of systemic incompetence, even into what were otherwise qualified experimental investigations. It is for these reasons, that virtually every general sort of long-range eco - nomic forecast presented publicly by leading personalities and institutions has proven, consistently, to be essentially in - competent, as we witness this incompetence afresh, in the pol - icy shaping of the U.S. Federal government, and also most foreign governments presently. What should have been the obvious issue here, is the fact, which I explain, I think that done adequately, in this location, that science and sense-certainty are antithetical subject- matters. Science requires some kind of evidence whose very nature affords us a means of verifying, or refuting the notions of the organization of the universe which sense-perceptions alone would tend to imply. \u00047 In other words, science begins where and when a-priori presumptions, such as those of Eu - clidean geometry, have been cast aside as being inherently, systemically, absurd. Thus, contrary to the viewpoint expressed by the dupes of the Sophist hoaxster Claudius Ptolemy, the universe never simply repeats itself. There are always what may appear to be cyclical changes, but any given such set of changes is also subject to a higher set of changes, and so on. It is not some ob - served simple repetitions which define the organization of the celestial navigator’s universe, but, rather, a nested array of successively higher-ranking such changes. It is the adducible principle of these nested orderings which provides us a practi - cally reliable, actually physical notion of the meaning of “uni - \u00047. “Sense-certainty” is properly limited to discriminating between an actu - ally experienced, as opposed to a merely imagined sense-experience. verse,” as in the case of Einstein’s notion of a finite, but un - bounded universe. \u00048 Such arrays of experimentally verifiable, nested patterns of universal change, thus define the proper meaning of uni - verse . This situates the notion of universal physical princi - ples . These are notions which correspond to recorded experi - ence of observations in long-ranging calendars of the type attributable to products of a culture shaped by a long-ranging practice of celestial navigation, and are, thus, specific to the fruitful work of successive generations of astro-navigators. The notion of a universe of anti-entropic changes, so defined, is the unique quality of founding basis for a competent repre - sentation of any notion of science as such. So, from that standpoint, we have Heracleitus’ famous aphorism, and its echoes in Plato’s Parmenides dialogue. In a true scientific knowledge of the type rooted in the habits acquired from celestial navigation, nothing exists but con - tinuing change. Only the practical reliance on evidence of the universal, as demonstrated by reliance on long astronomical cycles expressed in terms of calendars of several thousands of years, or much longer evidence from the practice of celes - tial navigation, permits mankind to escape successfully from the folly of assuming that a-priori notions of sense-certainty define the actual universe in which we exist. That is to be taken as the practical meaning of the term “universal.” It is the study of qualitative changes in ordering of the universal process, as in astrophysics or microphysics, which, by free - ing us of the effects of blind, habituated faith in sense- perception, define the only competent notions of truthfulness essential for the foundations of both science and competent statecraft generally. Second: The Method of Science Thus, the Pythagoreans, who benefitted most notably on this account from the influence of the science of the Egyp - tians, adopted an expandable body of scientific knowledge which the Egyptians shared with relevant Classical Greeks, a knowledge named Sphaerics by them. Although we know competent science to be much, much older than the Pythago - reans, the poor state of organization of surviving documen - tation, such as the fragmentary, surviving documentation of the work of Thales and Heracleitus, compels us to take the known heritage of the Pythagoreans and Plato as today’s his - torical benchmark-knowledge of systematic scientific thought. In adopting that view, we must emphasize that the views on matters of physical science which are, like the Sophistry of Euclid, or reductionists such as the crude materialists, con - trary to that of these preferred sources, are proven to be in - competent, even in their own terms. \u00048. Note again, that the conception of a “finite but unbounded universe” is specific to a science free of the intrinsically pathological presumptions of re - ductionist methods such as empiricism."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"March 1\u0018, 2008 EIR Feature 25 We are thus obliged, as were the Pythagoreans and Plato, and Nicholas of Cusa and his intellectual heirs later, to con - trast the notion of universals to the notions of local sense- perception. On this account, the pivotally crucial heritage of the Pythagoreans and Plato is to be located in three outstanding features of the knowledge presented by these sources: First, the notion of the comma , from Pythagoras. Second, the duplication of the cube (purely by methods of construction), by Plato’s friend, the Pythagorean Archytas. Third, the conception of the immortality of the hu - man soul, attributed implicitly to Pythagoras, and rig - orously defined by Plato. When we view the accomplishments of the Pythagore - ans, in retrospect, from the standpoint of Kepler’s fundamen - tal discoveries of principle presented in Kepler’s The New Astronomy , the notion of Sphaerics is stretched, as the evi - dence requires, to take into account the notion of the onto - logically infinitesimal associated with elliptical functions as this challenge was presented by Kepler to his intended heirs in the founding of modern physical science. By “modern physical science,” we must signify such matters as the uniquely original discovery of the ontologically infinitesimal calculus by the Leibniz who combined Kepler’s own discov - ery with the experimentally grounded, universal principle of least action which had been presented in a preliminary form by Fermat. For the remainder of the matters to be considered on this account, the essential issue of scientific method was settled in the opening pages of Bernhard Riemann’s habilitation disser - tation, when time by itself, matter by itself, and space by it - self, ceased to be subjects of competent science, and the world view later expressed by Albert Einstein took over competent physical science, top down. Third: Physical Science & Classical Culture This author’s deepest personal complaint against the kind of argument underlying the notorious New York Times’ Style Book, is that the implicitly calculated, net effect of the change from Classical modes, which the Times’ manual rep - resents, is not merely entirely away from Classical practice, but habituates the consenting dupe of that manual to either a “grammarian’s funeral,” or, at the least, a systemic violation of the most essential features of the higher order of menta - tion expressed by all thoughtful modes of Classical prose and poetry. The mind of the victim of the Times’ implicitly embedded doctrine, is a crippling form of stultification of the processes of thinking and communication which directs the Times’ victim into the essentially irrational habits of the kind of Sophistry which is, indeed, fairly recognized as the duped readers’ loss of power for actual Classical thought and composition. By preventing the victim of the Times’ and kindred doc - trines from communicating in terms of what Percy Shelley identified, as in his In Defence of Poetry , as profound and impassioned modes of communication respecting man and nature, the Times’ and other sources avoid, and even seek to destroy the same intellectually and morally superior terms to which I had become habituated, since childhood and youth, EIRNS/Philip Ulanowsky The Pythagoreans and Plato made three pivotally crucial contributions to univeral knowledge: 1. the notion of the “ comma ,” from Pythagoras; 2. the doubling of the cube by the Pythagorean Archytas; and 3. the conception of the immortality of the human soul, attributed to Pythagoras, and rigorously defined by Plato. Left: Pythagoras of Samos; right: Plato of Athens."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"26 Feature EIR March 1\u0018, 2008 from Classical authors’ works. The crippling of the power to speak coher - ently, as by the Times’ doctrine, is also an habituated crippling of the power to think. So, the credulous victim of the Times’ doctrine suffers a crippling im - pairment of the ability to think compe - tently at all. The systemic fault in what the Times’ style typifies, is properly rec - ognized as the same systemic form of pathology expressed in the way in which Eighteenth-Century, neo- Cartesian empiricism corrupted the ability among many relevant, nomi - nally leading scientists, of that and lat - er centuries, to think scientifically. For example, without such systemic stupe - faction in institutionalized education generally, today’s acceptance of Ernst Mach, Bertrand Russell, and such Russell epigonoi as Professor Norbert Wiener and John von Neumann, would not have been feasible. Typical, and crucial in this Sophist perversion called modern Liberalism, is that de - nial of those essential principles of competent modern physical science which is associated with Descartes and such among his successors as the em - piricists generally, the positivists, and the existentialists. Crucial, is the loss of the principle of the Pythagorean comma, which is not a mere punctua - tion mark; that loss is the same thing as the loss of access to the conception of the ontologically infinitesimal in phys - ical science. The fraudulent element in schemes akin to the New York Times’ Style Book, is the transparent attempt, there, to appear to emulate the Aristotelean syllogistic method. This is to be viewed from the standpoint of the theologian, in terms of what I have refer - enced earlier as Philo’s condemnation of the Aristotelean the - ology of his time. The Times follows in the footsteps of those Gnostics who came under attack by Philo on this same ac - count. That is to emphasize, that the universe, like our Solar Sys - tem itself, is a process of anti-entropic creation. The force of creation (anti-entropy) is expressed as an undeniable paradox which is presented for observation as an irony, the irony, akin to the type of irony which drives a Mozart or Beethoven com - position in conformity with the principle of J.S. Bach, of some actual feature of a process—the proverbial “punch line,” which reflects the fact that the process represented is not closed, is perfectly imperfected, waiting to be perfected by the relevant richer development of the creative powers of the in - dividual human mind. All meaningful statements in Classical art-forms are pointing to a coherent process of “imbalance,” like the onto - logical infinitesimal of Cusa’s rejection of the fallacy of Archimedes’ quadrature of the circle, an affirmation of the principle of gravitation which drives Kepler’s Solar orbits, the Leibniz calculus, or the eyes of a Rembrandt masterpiece. It is that quality of irony, so expressed, which marks the difference between the ideas of irony which drive literate poetry or prose, and the practice of Sophistry prescribed in the New York Times Style Book. Like the fundamental scientific discoveries of Cusa, Kepler, et al.: “All meaningful statements in Classical art-forms are pointing to a coherent process of ‘imbalance,’ ” a quality of irony, such as we see in the eyes of a Rembrandt masterpiece. Rembrandt produced this etching, a self-portrait, in 1648, the year of the Treaty of Westphalia."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"March 1\u0018, 2008 EIR Feature 27 Fourth: Human Immortality & Science Every meaningful aspect of human practice of true sci - ence and Classical artistic expression, reflects a principled difference between the personality of the living human being and any and all species of animal life. This consideration, as just so stated by me here, is crucial to the entire argument of this document. Call it a kind of quality of “resonance.” I explain this as follows. When we take the relationship of the human species to all other living species, and also treat the relationships within the other living species, and the effect of the human species’ dy - namic interaction with those others, the action of the human species upon the set of all living species, is to be seen as unique. This uniqueness is located within the specifically cre - ative potential of the individually sovereign mental powers of the human individual. In this set of relationships, the human species is unique by virtue of its unique kind of capacity for the willful ordering of the increase of the potential relative population-density of living species generally. This unique - ness of the human individual’s powers, and, therefore, that individual’s species-nature, is expressed in its effects as in - trinsically immortal. The point which I have just introduced here, thus, should be weighed from the standpoint of the methods of physical chemistry defined by the work of Academician V.I. Ver - nadsky, the Vernadsky view of physical chemistry which was unique in his original definitions of the respective principles of the Biosphere and Noösphere. From the experimental standpoint of Vernadsky’s emphasis on physical chemistry, we must recognize that the distinction between man and beast is comparable, from the standpoint of universal physical principles, to the physical-chemical distinction of the non- living portion of the gross mass and weight of our planet from that expressed portion as the Biosphere. The distinction between Biosphere and Noösphere is also an expression of a universal physical principle of distinction between the Bio - sphere and Noösphere treated, respectively, as universal phase-spaces. Where then, is the principle of human cognition situated, in a fashion comparable to the difference in principle of phase- spaces separating the physical chemistry of non-living pro - cesses from living ones? In other words, in brief, there must be a universal principle, located in the individual human mind’s development, which is not to be located in any other expression of life. In effect, the answer assumes the broadly descriptive form of “tuning.” Rather than presuming that human cogni - tion is an “evolutionary” outgrowth of living processes gen - erally, consider the Biosphere as a physical phase-space which provides the soil in which the independently created seeds of human individual cognition are able to take root and grow. The importance of posing that conception in the fashion which I have done here, as in some earlier locations, is the uniquely specific effect of human creativity in changing the composition of the physical universe as a whole, that in the sense of the way in which human creativity has already will - fully directed a conceptually orderable process of changes of the planet Earth as a whole in respect to both abiotic forms and the Biosphere. In other words, actual human creativity (anti-entropy) is a universal physical “force” independently of the capabilities expressed by both the abiotic universe (as a phase-space) and also the principle of the Biosphere. The stereotype of this human cognitive principle, is seen in the physical effect of the change of the planet Earth as a whole, changes such as the increase of the mass of the Bio - sphere relative to the abiotic phase of the planet, and, also, the increase of the Noösphere as a whole, relative to both the Biosphere and the abiotic mass of the planet. In effect, thus, the creative powers of the individual member of the human species are a physical force of self-change in and of the uni - verse as a whole. Ideas of the type associated with the gen - eration of this unitary process of universal change in the physical universe, are efficient “physical forces” in and of themselves. In effect, therefore, the mind of the living mortal individ - ual, insofar as that individual develops creative powers as I have indicated in this published location, is a universal physi - cal principle of the universe, as the relevant portion of Gene - sis 1 identifies, if only symbolically, the special place and role of man and woman in the universe as a whole. These relations of the human intellect’s immortal capabil - ity, while the individual is still alive as a medium for transmis - sion of this higher power, have, thus, the general categorical quality of resonance, tuning. The instrument dies, but the mu - sic is immortal. This brings us to the matter posed at the outset of this re - port: The assuredly self-inflicted present doom of the British Empire. 5. Why That Empire Is Doomed I am, as Friedrich Schiller proposed, a patriot and a world citizen, a citizen and humanist. In such a profession there are few guaranteed rewards proffered to the wise, except that of what one has contributed to one’s own immortality. There - fore, let us rejoice. One night in the Spring of 19 \u00186, I stood in the Calcutta Maidan, watching literally millions of Indians marching en masse, as brothers, shouting an antiphonal chorus of “Jai hind” and “Pakistan zindaba,” demanding promised free - dom as a price for the terrible mass murder which British occupation police had wreaked with direct, headlong, massed machine-gun fire into the forward ranks of an ap - proaching crowd of protestors. The congealed blood had"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"28 Feature EIR March 1\u0018, 2008 been still thick on the pavement of that street on the follow - ing morning after that shooting. President Franklin Roos - evelt had died just a year before, Harry Truman was U.S. President, and I knew then, with great sadness, the general nature of what the death of President Franklin Roosevelt had meant. In the following year, it would be reported that virtually the same men who had marched together in Calcutta, then, would be slaughtering one another, for the amusement of the British, in the bloody division of what had been a united peo - ple in the year before. As I have stated in the beginning, whatever else happens, today, that British Empire which I learned to hate devoutly in Calcutta, is now probably doomed, by its own hand, in one sense of that, or another. The United Kingdom could partici - pate in a general economic recovery, on the condition that it is willing to give up ties to the present Anglo-Dutch Liberal form of an attempted, global, neo-Venetian financier empire, now, as the United Kingdom should have given up imperial intentions in honor of the President Franklin Roosevelt who had died fighting that cause for all humanity; otherwise, in any case, that empire, if it continues, were now doomed by its own hand. Now, today. the potential ability of the world’s human population to sustain the present level of human population under presently prevailing standards of practice , has already exceeded the limits which the policy of our present world has allowed to be imposed, artificially, upon itself. This tragic horror is largely a result of the introduction of “globalization” and “neo-malthusian” fads, circa 1970-72. This situation has been brought about by the present in - fluence of a lunatic form of Delphic “environmentalism,” a mass-murderous Dionysian cult. This cultish folly of these establishment cultists, has lowered the potential relative population-density of the planet, at the same time that the population of the relatively poorest regions of the planet have expanded their role in the world’s production of phys - ical needs, while the active productive potentials of the populations of North America and Europe have undergone the self-inflicted punishment of a continuing, presently ag - gravated form and degree of artificially induced, physical collapse. Most unfortunately, since the aftermath of the death of Franklin Roosevelt, until today, most among our present gen - erations of typical Americans, even leading political figures, among others, have lost connection, through attrition, to any competently systemic knowledge of their nation’s actual his - tory. Only an exceptional, relative handful of those born be - tween 19 \u00185 and 1958, even among today’s political leaders, possess a significant remnant of such intellectual compe - tence. Therefore, to summarize the case at hand in this report, we must step back a pace or two in modern European history, to consider the developments which led, from the events leading into that 176 \u0004 break of England with its colonies in North America, and on into the establishment of the U.S. Federal republic. Briefly, therefore, some highlights of this history are to be considered as matters of background for presenting the cru - cial point of this present chapter of the report: London: Our Republic’s Great Adversary From the accession of France’s Louis XI, until the follies of France’s so-called “Sun King,” Louis XIV, France had been recurrently, the first true and leading modern nation of Eu - rope. Since the death of Louis XI, France’s greatest period of power in outlook, science and scientific leadership in the world at large, and of related economic development, came to life again through the role of Cardinal Mazarin and Mazarin’s associate Jean-Baptiste Colbert. France, then, under the lead - ership of that Colbert, was the leading nation of Europe, and remained the leading nation in physical economy and physi - cal science \u00049 even into the great decline of France as a nation during the succession of the Martinist masonic cult of Count Joseph de Maistre’s typical, London-steered cases of the Queen’s Necklace, the Jacobin Terror, and the Napoleonic wars. The foundations for the decline of France from about the time of the wars into which Louis XIV was lured, led into the corresponding, continuing rise, as during that same time, un - der the influence of such as the Cartesian Abbe Conti, of the Anglo-Dutch Liberal heritage of Paolo Sarpi. Thus, the Eighteenth Century still echoed the effects which had become embedded during the earlier phase of reli - gious warfare, warfare which had been launched, chiefly, by that Venetian financier oligarchy associated with Paolo Sarpi. It must be remembered, that both of the opposing factions of Venice had previously combined their efforts to ruin Europe - an civilization with Sarpian, Liberal Venice’s orchestration of the religious warfare during the 1\u001892-16 \u00188 interval; this had left effects. That time, prior to 16 \u00188, had been the interval of a return, then, to a virtual “little new dark age” in the political history of Habsburg-inflicted Europe. It had been a kind of relative dark age which had persisted in successive phases from the launching of systemic anti-Semitism in modern Eu - rope by the Spanish Inquisition (1 \u001892), until the Peace of Westphalia (16 \u00188). However, in 16 \u00188, the role of the Pope’s special agent as - signed to France, Mazarin, had been crucial in creating the conditions for a revival of modern Europe, through an ending \u00049. As typified by the Ecole Polytechnique under the leadership and pro - grams of Gaspard Monge and Lazare Carnot. The great decline of France came under the combined effects of the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte and the wrecking of the quality of the Ecole Polytechnique under the interim occupa - tion regime of the Duke of Wellington and British occupation agents Laplace and Cauchy. By the late 1820s, leadership in science had passed from France to the then fragmented Germany of Alexander von Humboldt, Gauss, Dirich - let, and Riemann."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"March 1\u0018, 2008 EIR Feature 29 of generalized religious warfare per se. What emerged after 16 \u00188 was a modern European civilization, however troubled still. An order worthy of the name of civilization, was reborn with the 16 \u00188 Peace of Westphalia, thus establishing a civili - zation which would die in infamy today were the evil forces represented by the enemies of the Westphalian principle, such as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, to triumph in trans-Atlantic relations now. It had been during the time of the follies of that model pre - decessor of the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, France’s Louis XIV, that France was lured into the snare prepared by the mar - itime financier power of Sarpi’s Anglo-Dutch successors. For example, the coup in England represented by William of Orange and his Anglo-Dutch Liberal faction, had led, in turn, to the establishment of a new empire through the means of London’s orchestration of the so-called “Seven Years War” among the continental powers of Europe. This had led, in turn, into the emergence of the British East India Company of Lord Shelburne in the February 176 \u0004 Peace of Paris, where Canada and India, among other strategically crucial places, fell into the hands of the maritime power of the Anglo-Dutch Liberal forces now centered in London. With that February 176 \u0004 Treaty of Paris, the Anglo-Dutch Liberal faction embodied in the British East India Company became, by fact and intention, a certain kind of caricature of what British braggarts called a new Roman empire. It was an empire indeed, but, essentially, a world maritime empire cast in the likeness of the realm of the Venetian financier- oligarchy. From the time of the rise of the Presidency of Franklin Roosevelt, through the lingering aftermath of a U.S.A. leader - ship representing loyal veterans of the Roosevelt Presidency, the legacy of that Roosevelt Presidency resonated still, until August 1971: until the successive effects of the wrecking of the Bretton Woods system and of the oil-price hoax which combined effects to establish the present hegemony of the Anglo-Dutch Liberal control over the price of the U.S. dollar by the “spot market.” This deplorable state of affairs has con - tinued up through the moment I write, today. Through the assassination of U.S. President John F. Ken - nedy, and the consequent closing of that planned trap for the U.S. which became the launching of that war in Indo-China which that Kennedy, like Generals of the Armies Douglas MacArthur and Dwight Eisenhower would have prevented, the U.S.A. has been induced to destroy itself, by attrition, as a nation, under the guidance of the British empire and its virtual British colonial officials operating in financial centers such as Manhattan and Chicago. Since then, during the course of 1968-1981, under the successive Nixon, Ford, and Carter administrations, the U.S. economy’s most essential pillars of true sovereignty have been systematically destroyed by the complicity of our own elected governments, complicity in submitting to the policies which the British empire worked to impose upon us. I must emphasize that this has been a submission which has been led by our elected governments themselves, right up to the pres - ent instant I write these very lines. Now, the Present Crisis The means by which the present, lunatic policy of global practice, which I have denounced here, has persisted, since 1971, for as many decades as it has, has now produced a wave of what has now become an intrinsically hyperinfla - tionary expansion of merely nominal financial-monetary as - sets. Thus, in the recent decades, 1987-2008 most notably, through an intrinsically hyperinflationary scheme typified by the policies of practice of former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, a great portion of the physical output of the planet has been managed through the relentless expansion of unpayable debt to be delivered to the customer who could never repay the obligation incurred by the prod - uct for which the producer will never actually be paid. Re - cently, the point was reached, quite lawfully, at which a hyper-inflationary crisis of the type experienced by 192 \u0004 Weimar Germany has struck the global Greenspan “Pyramid Club” scheme. Unless appropriate reforms of the type which I have spec - ified are adopted very soon, a general, global breakdown- crisis will unleash a chain-reaction general collapse of the present world system, a collapse comparable to what struck Germany in 192 \u0004, and Europe as a whole, earlier, during the mid-Fourteenth-Century “New Dark Age.” Were the present quasi-medieval, “Tower of Babel”-like policies of “globalization” continued under current condi - tions, the potential relative population-density of the world as a whole would collapse in a degree greater than the rate of de - population which struck Europe during the mid-Fourteenth- Century “New Dark Age.” In the meantime, we have used up a critical margin of the presently standard quality of the world’s raw materials. This, by itself, is not necessarily a cause for a crisis. Were the world to unleash a widespread application of capital-intensive in - vestment in existing models of nuclear-fission power, and abandon the lunatic “green” models favored widely today, the problem of apparent raw-materials scarcity would not be a critical problem, respecting quantities, qualities, or prices. However, under a “green” and “globalized” doctrine, the pres - ently onrushing, global crisis, would mean a prolonged and very deep depopulation of a planet sunk deeply into a pro - longed, new dark age. ‘Energy-Flux Density’ Unfortunately, a great private institution, the Fusion En - ergy Foundation (FEF), was destroyed by what the U.S. Fed - eral courts later classified, albeit with manifest reluctance, as a fraud upon the bankruptcy court, a fraud organized by the office of the Attorney-General of the U.S.A., acting through the jurisdiction of the notorious “rocket docket,” the Alexan -"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"\u00040 Feature EIR March 1\u0018, 2008 dria, Virginia Federal Court under Judge Albert V. Bryan. Nonetheless, during the preceding period that FEF was per - mitted to function, certain notable contributions to science and the cause of statecraft were made by it, made directly, or by a kind of ricocheted effect. Among these contributions was the adoption of a proposal for general use of the term “energy-flux density,” as had been proposed by a leading Soviet scientist. I stress that this adoption of the term “energy-flux densi - ty,” by scientific parties on both sides of the “Cold War” di - vide, was a kind of moral compromise, although, under the circumstances of that time, a justifiable one. The serious practical problem which this use of “energy- flux density” was adopted to moderate, is that critical devel - opments of the 1970s had destroyed the ability among in - formed persons of good conscience, to continue being willing accomplices in the toleration of a famous hoax, a hoax in the name of “thermodynamics,” the so-called “Second Law of Thermodynamics,” a hoax which had been launched by the Nineteenth-Century figures Clausius, Grassmann, Kelvin and others. The hoax in question had been launched as a radical- empiricist (e.g., “positivist,” “radically reductionist”) reifica - tion of an important contribution to the understanding of the subject of thermodynamics by a prominent member of France’s Ecole Polytechnique, Sadi Carnot, on the subject of heat. \u00180 Like the legendary “Fat Lady” of the carnival, Clausius et al. had degraded what was called thermodynamics to the simplistic counting of calories. The use of the term “energy- flux density” served as a rule-of-thumb variety of remedy for some of the worst effects on policy-shaping which had been contributed by the silliness of Clausius, Grassmann, Kelvin, the Machian Ludwig Boltzmann, et al., in the matter of the discussion of nuclear-fission power and related matters. In the meantime, the fact of the matter is that the density of power, per square centimeter of cross-section of flux, describes a “non-linear” function, such that the same number of count - able calories of nuclear-fission power is far greater in its pow - er to do work, per countable calorie, than any ordinary chemi - cal source. It is the increase, by orders of magnitude, of the equiva - lent energy-flux-density of sources of power, which defines, conveniently, the amount of actual net work which a single calorie may effect.

To oppose nuclear- fission power as a general source, is, now, in effect, a criminal form of practice of mass-murder against the human race. In fact, the present scheme called “globalization” must be identi - fied now as a practice of “genocide.” This case is a convenient illustration of the problem to be addressed in the following, concluding part of this present re - port as a whole. The Road to Britain’s ‘Catch-22’ What Winston Churchill and others regarded as the threat which President Franklin Roosevelt represented to the contin - ued existence of the British Empire, was, in sum, that the un - leashing of the popular will of the people of the U.S.A. for a great expansion of the productive powers of labor represented an immediately mortal threat to the continued existence of the British Empire. In this estimation, the British imperialists were correct. The immediate threat perceived by London, was Presi - dent Franklin Roosevelt’s repeatedly stated intention for the post-war world: that the great military-economic, agricul - tural, industrial, and infrastructural machine which that President had mustered both for the recovery of a shattered U.S. economy and in preparation for a war which had just become already inevitable a few days prior to Roosevelt’s first inauguration, would be converted, at the close of the war, for the included purpose of developing the colonial and semi-colonial territories of the world in ways essential to es - tablish those territories as inde - pendently sovereign nation- states, thus eradicating the institution of imperialism from the world at large. Such were the intentions expressed by the 19 \u0018\u0018 proceedings of the Bret - ton Woods monetary confer - ence. \u00181 Such was Roosevelt’s intention for founding a United Nations Organization. Immediately following Pr esi - dent Roosevelt’s death, the Brit - ish monarchy and the right-wing U.S. forces which had been pre- war backers of Mussolini and Hitler’s rise to power, reverted, under President Truman, to be - gin the process of destroying the Franklin Roosevelt legacy, and its capabilities, and to do this as rapidly as were feasible. Since such shifts in policy, from one direction toward an opposite one, must allow time for uprooting the established paradigms of the presently influential generation, it was near - ly twenty years, the lapse from the death of Roosevelt to that of the John F. Kennedy who had strongly reaffirmed a com - mitment to the Roosevelt legacy, before the work of actually destroying the U.S.A.’s economy could be set fully into mo - tion by the War in Indo-China and the unleashing of the Sixty- Eighters \u00182 for what was shamelessly identified as “a cultural- paradigm shift.” During the interval 1961-1968, there had been many at - tempted assassinations of high-ranking figures associated with the cultural paradigm of the World War II military veter - ans and related types of political leaders, such as Charles de Gaulle and Kennedy; there were other de facto coups d’etat or \u00181. Many economists and others have stated ex post facto, that John May - nard Keynes had defined Franklin Roosevelt’s intention for the post-war monetary system. The ex post facto judgment is mistaken, but for many, an honest error. Roosevelt’s intention had been the break-up of the British and kindred empires.

The shock effect of these tu - multuous doings, especially the assassination of President Kennedy, enabled the launching of the War in Indo-China, over, quite literally, President Kennedy’s dead body. How - ever, the most crucial of these politically orchestrated, horrid developments was the co-ordinated unleashing of the Sixty- Eighters and the role of those Sixty-Eighters, internationally, in launching that new epidemic of malthusianism called anti- nuclear, anti-farmer, anti-industrialist “environmentalism.” These have become the new breed of existentialists and other virtual traitors to the human species. All that evil in defense of the British Empire! It has not ended with those developments. “Globaliza - tion,” the campaign for a new “Tower of Babel,” is a crucial part of this. The British imperial faction has gone back to its 1920s and 19 \u00040s promotion of the fascism of Mussolini’s Ita - ly, Schacht’s and Hitler’s Germany, and similar cases of that time. Today’s George Shultz and Felix Rohatyn are typical of today’s would-be copies of the fascist figures and tyrannies of the 1920s and 19 \u00040s, figures of the types which the British monarchy had played a leading role in creating and backing from the start, then, as now. Now, comes the proverbial “Catch-22” as such. Prometheus Bound The pattern just described is known to ancient through modern history by various names, all properly chosen to ex - press the same phenomenon. Typical names from ancient times are “The Persian Model,” or, generically, “The Oligar - chical Model,” as typified by the legacy of Sparta, of the Ro - man Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Venetian-Crusader tyranny, and by British imperialism, and its successor, the fas - cism of Felix Rohatyn, Michael Bloomberg, et al., since 176 \u0004. The paradigm which underlies these expressions of the oligarchical model, is found in Aeschylus’ Prometheus Bound . The key to the oligarchical model is the banning of knowledge of universal physical principles from the general - ity of the population, especially the so-called lower classes. The British population as seen, and, perhaps worse, heard, on the television receivers today, is typical of a population which has been, to a large degree, stupefied culturally into a mental state suited to the making of a helotry in the tradition of the ancient oligarchical model. All imperial systems, in their character as systems, de - pend for their conditional durability on stifling those creative powers of the human individual which are expressed typically in the form of discovery of universal physical principles, or comparable intellectual qualities of Classical artistic activity. The design is intended to degrade the great mass of humanity, as virtual cattle, to a condition of mental life in which human mental life is brought to resemble the farmer’s herd of cattle. This effect is accomplished, simply, by outlawing mental ac - tivity tantamount to knowledge of fire, or, better said today, nuclear fission. It was on this account, that the legendary Olympian Zeus of Aeschylus, condemned Prometheus to qua - si permanent torture for confiding knowledge of the use of fire to those intended Delphic cattle known as mortal man and woman. To keep a large population stupefied in a state like that of the unfortunate ordinary “Brit” seen on screen today, is con - sidered necessary if the population is to be mentally self- incapacitated in a manner suited to oligarchical overlordship. The destruction of Classical culture in mid-1960s Germany on, and the brutish dogmas of practice of that piece of fascist filth of Adorno, et al., the book called The Authoritarian Per - sonality , are typical of such swinishness. Such Malthusian or kindred policies of practice, encoun - ter an existentially crucial problem for the society which har - bors such trickery. Any society operating on a fixed techno - logical level is doomed on that account, but any culture which promotes the creative powers of its general population is one which will come around, sooner or later to overthrowing oli - garchical modalities. Thus, the British empire, if it wishes to remain an empire, must suppress actual creativity in the gen - erality of the subject population, or cease to be tolerated as an empire, thus creating a situation in which the British must either give up their imperial tradition, or be doomed by the consequences of suppressing scientific progress as a charac - teristic of the morality of its own population. I.e.: “Catch-22.” The British must monopolize scientific- technological progress in order to stupefy its subject popula - tions, which it must do to remain an empire. Yet, if it does not promote that scientific and technological progress in practice in such a general way that the potential productive powers of the general labor-force keep ahead of the rate of attrition in - herent in a fixed level of technology, the empire will undergo a physical collapse, as is witnessed by the general history of imperial and similar attempts at “zero-technological-growth” systems. Lately, the combination of the increase in population, es - pecially among the relatively poor masses into which much of production has been shifted away from the formerly industri - alized powers, with the falling overall productivity caused by this “outsourcing,” has produced a fall in per-capita and per- square-kilometer rates of net physical output which will doom the present civilization, if continuation of that approximately net-zero-growth policy were permitted. Currently, the world is operating below technological break-even on this account, for precisely this set of reasons. The empire, just because it is an empire in terms of the embedded cultural characteristics of its reigning institutions, is probably doomed, simply for the reason that it would pre - fer to die, than abandon those features of its embedded cul - tural reflexes which define it as an empire. For the rest of us, the question is: do we prefer to go down with the empire, or to cut free from both its physical, and, more important, cul - tural embrace?"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"34 Strategy EIR March 14, 2008 GLOBALIZATION HAS FAILED!

Her article has been translated from German. You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can not fool all of the people all of the time. —Abraham Lincoln Anyone who has been in constant dialogue with the popu - lation at booktables and on the street, as the BüSo has been, cannot fail to have noticed a recent turnabout in popular senti - ment. Faced with proposals for wage and pension increases which come nowhere near the so-called “perceived” rate of in - flation; the self-enrichment of top corporate executives, which can only be described as obscene, as they continue to eliminate tens of thousands of jobs, despite their super-profits; the wide - spread sense that we’re living in a media dictatorship; and the spectacle of a government whose members, on a daily basis, violate their solemn oath to protect the general welfare, wheth - er it be against [the European Union bureaucracy in] Brussels or against financial locusts of every description—there is a growing sense in the population that “enough is enough!” And even though no one can predict what the world will look like as this year draws to a close, it is nevertheless certain that the financial oligarchy’s strategy of reacting to globaliza - tion’s systemic crisis with the same methods they employed in the 1930s, is not turning out to be as easy as they had hoped. It remains an open question whether the next U.S. President will respond to the world economic and financial crisis with the tradition of Franklin D. Roosevelt, or will instead impose the recipes of Mussolini and of Hjalmar Schacht. And it equal - ly is undecided whether Europe will be transformed into an oligarchical dictatorship with the Lisbon Treaty, or into a Eu - rope of the Fatherlands, of sovereign nation-states. Hillary Clinton’s primary election victories, especially in Texas and Ohio, have ensured that she will remain in the race all the way to the Democratic Party Convention at the end of August. And leading up to the decisive April 22 primary in Pennsylvania, the Rezko-Auchi scandal and the “Obama tri - al” in Chicago will have dashed Obama’s election prospects. And by that point, the disintegration of the international finan - cial system will have reached new hurricane levels, and will demonstrate conclusively that Obama has nothing substantial to offer for solving the systemic crisis, and that Hillary Clin - ton is the only candidate so far, who has been addressing at least some aspects of the crisis, such as the mortgage crisis, and has been calling for a moratorium on home foreclosures. But the danger of a fascist resolution in the U.S.A. is by no means over. In the wake of Clinton’s latest victories, Michael Bloomberg is no longer considering running as an independent candidate, but instead he is using his billions to ramp up the pressure to establish himself as Wall Street’s man for Republi - can Vice Presidential candidate—a new Dick Cheney for a fu - ture President McCain, who, even now, is not in good health. ‘Stealth Bomber’ Lisbon Treaty? Meanwhile, in Europe, governments’ attempts to smuggle through the Lisbon Treaty as a sort of stealth bomber, under the noses of the population, in order to abolish democracy co - vertly and without the population’s consent, are meeting growing resistance. In Ireland, where a referendum is set to be held in late May, polls indicate that only 26% of Irish citizens favor the EU treaty. In other European countries, ever greater numbers of people who learn about this, are in a state of mounting rage against their governments’ blatant deception maneuvers.

The hijinks around the Treaty would be a total farce, were it not for the fact that it has very real and tragic consequences for the citizens concerned. In Berlin, Hamburg, and Hesse, Germany’s parties continue to play their black-green and red-red-green sand-castle games, while on the federal level, they have illegally transferred to Brussels 86% of the sover - eignty which voters entrusted to their rep - resentatives—for that is the percentage of legislative initiatives which have been coming straight from Brussels. And so, if the remaining 14% is given away by the Lisbon Treaty, why should anyone care who makes a coalition with whom? Cyn - ics point out that, as expected, the only right which the members of parliament will not give away, is their right to in - crease their own salaries. The next time Frau Merkel starts lec - turing foreign heads of state about a lack of democracy and violation of human rights in their countries, as she has already done with Russia, China, and Zimbabwe, international observers would do well to recall that Frau Merkel, too, has a little duck’s foot, as Hein - rich Heine described in his poem “Waldeinsamkeit.” 1 And the name of her little duck’s foot is: democracy deficit! 1. Among the “elementary spirits” which Heine introduces in his poem “Waldeinsamkeit” (“Forest Solitude”) are the gnomes: Sie tragen Rotmäntelchen, lang und bauschig, Die Miene ist ehrlich, doch bang und lauschig; Ich ließ nicht merken, daß ich entdeckt, Warum sie so ängstlich die Füße versteckt. Sie haben nämlich Entenfüße Und bilden sich ein, daß Niemand es wisse. Das ist eine tiefgeheime Wund, Worüber ich nimmermehr spötteln kunnt. Ach Himmel! wir Alle, gleich jenen Zwergen, Wir haben ja Alle etwas zu verbergen; Kein Christenmensch, wähnen wir, hätte entdeckt, Wo unser Entenfüßchen steckt. They wear little red coats, long and baggy, Their demeanor is honest, yet anxious and wary; I didn’t let them know that I had discovered Why they so anxiously conceal their feet. Namely, they have duck’s feet, But they imagine that no one knows this. It is a deeply secret wound Which I was never able to joke with them about. My heavens! All of us, just like those dwarves, We all have something to hide; No Christian, so we imagine, could have discovered Where we’re concealing our little duck’s feet. It is equally scandalous that the government still refuses to admit that we’re in the final phase of a systemic collapse, and that they have done absolutely nothing to shield the population from its ravages, nor have they taken any initiatives to over - come the crisis. Apparently they feel they can comfortably ac - quiesce, now that they have ceded their monetary sovereignty to the European Central Bank. Fat chance: European Central Bank (ECB) President Trichet has just now decided that, in light of exploding inflation rates, the euro should continue to soar upward without restriction—while European exports col - lapse along with it. Because the reality is that neither Trichet, nor Europe’s governments, has the slightest idea what to do! Inflation Dynamite The greatest factor in the turnabout within the majority of the population is, without a doubt, the skyrocketing prices of food, home heating, and gasoline. The depreciation of the val - ue of money since the introduction of the “teuro” 2 has contin - ued without letup, and in many places people have to pay the same sum in euros which they previously had to pay in deutschemarks. But now, on top of this, since the outbreak of the global crisis last July, we have had to deal with spiralling inflation. Prices for milk and grain products, for example, in - creased by 20-40% between September and December of last year, while raw materials prices have risen 15.1% since Janu - ary—the greatest increase since the Commodity Research Bu - reau Spot Index was started in 1956!

Since 56% of all households in Germany must spend their entire income on basic living expenses, the actual inflation rate for them must be more like 10-20%, as opposed to the of - ficial 3% inflation rate. And as for poorer families which must spend most of their income on food, rent, and transportation alone, this means that they no longer have enough for healthy eating. Even the Wiesbadener Kurier —not exactly a paragon of social conscience—devoted an entire page to the specter of inflation, and reminded its readers that the “black decade” of the 1920s left especially the middle class and small business - men destitute, and that inflation brought fatal consequences, smoothing the way for the National Socialists. The fact that we have once again arrived at that same point, is shown by a new study by the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), which reports that the number of households with median income has shrunk over the past sev - en years from 62.3% to 54.1%. The number of households with lower income (less than 70% of the median) has mean - while grown from 18.9% to 25.4%, while the share of house - holds with high income (over 150% of median income) has grown from 18.8% to 20.5%. This means that over the past seven years, 5 million people have “dropped out” of the mid - dle class, and one-fourth of all households are poor, or have a meager income. So, if the public service trade unions refuse to be bought off with wage increase offers that are significantly lower than the real rate of inflation, they can hardly be blamed for caus - ing the increase in inflation, as the EU Commission and the ECB have been trying to convince them, but rather they are simply attempting to defend themselves against a massive re - duction in their members’ living standards. And so, it looks like we’re in for an uncontrollable strike wave here in Europe, based on all-too-justified demands. Such strikes, however, will succeed only if their leaders raise their eyes above the edges of their dinner plates, and—as the German Trade Union Federation did in the 1930s, with its Woytinsky-Tarnow-Baade Plan 3 —they concentrate on the causes of the economic crisis, and how to overcome it. Significantly, China’s government appears to be more concerned with its citizens’ well-being than people are in Ber - lin, because the Chinese are at least acknowledging the extent of the crisis. At a press conference, Ma Kai, Minister of the State Development and Reform Commission, along with Peo - ple’s Bank of China Governor Zhouo Xiaochuan and Finance Minister Xie Yuren, stressed that as a result of the global crisis and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s inflationary reaction to the mortgage crisis, China is facing entirely new challenges, which go way beyond its previous experience and existing know-how. But at the same time, they also announced mea - sures for defending the population’s living standard. More - over, the Chinese government declared that it will make the 3. “Wladimir Woytinsky, Revolutionary,” EIR , April 11, 1997. fight against inflation its absolute priority. Already back in November 2007, leading Chinese institutions and news media were reacting very positively to Lyndon LaRouche’s pro - grammatic proposals for a new financial architecture. Globalization Has Failed Giulio Tremonti, the former (and possibly future) Italian Economic Minister, has likewise made a public declaration that globalization is the height of folly, and has failed. And he’s right when he says that the crisis will grow far worse, and that the solution cannot come from any one country, but must be based on a New Bretton Woods system. What Germany’s government lacks most, is the courage to acknowledge the systemic nature of the crisis. Because without such an admission, they will surely be unable to mus - ter the courage to take measures needed to overcome the cri - sis. And in order that we may help Frau Merkel, the Cabinet members, and the Federal President more quickly to learn how to reduce their democracy deficit, we need a broad, pub - lic debate over Europe’s future course. And what we especial - ly need is a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. Even though people in Germany (and in other European nations) have long grown unaccustomed to the exercise of re - publican virtue, the beginning of civic involvement by a growing number of citizens is nevertheless a positive sign. Because only when people begin to grasp, before it is too late, the dramatic historic decisions we will have to face over the course of this year, and only if a sufficient number of them be - gin to personally intervene into this process, will there be well-founded hope that the systemic crisis which seems to be gripping all aspects of our lives, can be overcome. One thing is clear: A dramatic culmination of the world financial crisis, and of hyperinflation, will be setting the stage for both the U.S. Presidential elections, and European parlia - ments’ attempt to whip through a ratification of the EU Treaty. And every parliamentarian and citizen should get themselves uncompromisingly clear on the fact that by adopting the EU Treaty, we would be relinquishing all possibility of defending the general welfare and of adopting such measures as a New Deal and a New Bretton Woods system. With the EU Treaty, we would be condemning ourselves to plunging into a new dark age. There Is Hope As the financial crash escalates, there is, however, hope that in the course of the U.S. Presidential elections, Roos - evelt’s policies will be placed on the agenda, and that a grow - ing number of political leaders in the world will raise their voices in favor of a New Deal and a New Bretton Woods. If 2009 opens with a new President who activates Roosevelt’s policies, and if we in Europe can manage to bury the Monster of Lisbon once and for all, and can decide in favor of a vision of a Europe of the Fatherlands with a positive mission for world development, then we can forget about our present"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"March 14, 2008 EIR Strategy 37 terrors in short order. Battle Rages Over EU’s Lisbon Treaty by Rainer Apel If the European financier oligarchy has its way, the European Union’s Lisbon Treaty, which would strip member nations of any vestige of sovereignty, will be ratified this Spring, without debate, without anyone ever reading its 277 pages, and cer - tainly without any popular vote. If only one EU member na - tion fails to ratify the treaty, it cannot be put into effect. But since mid-February, resistance to the treaty has been mount - ing, at the same time that its proponents are moving to silence dissent. Helga Zepp-LaRouche, the chairwoman of the BüSo party in Germany (Civil Rights Solidarity Movement), issued a call on Feb. 23 for a referendum on the treaty in Germany (see EIR , Feb. 29). Ireland, as the only country so far that has scheduled a ref - erendum, is the particular focus of political countermoves. EU Commissioner Margot Wallstroem went to Dublin on Feb. 27, in an attempt to defuse Irish concerns over the loss of neutrality under the “solidarity clause” of the treaty, which would oblige nations to unite to combat “terrorist activities.” On Feb. 28, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, in a scarcely veiled attempt to corrupt the Irish population into accepting the treaty, proposed that Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern would be an ideal candidate for the new post of EU president. But there’s a sleight-of-hand here; similar offers have been made to several other nations, implying that if they voted “yes” to the treaty, the first EU Presidency would go to one of their politicians. Ahern went so far as to argue that the only way to cope with “global warming” would be for Europe to be strength - ened as a world player—and for that, the Irish would have to vote “yes” to the treaty. The pro-treaty camp in the European Parliament also or - ganized a vote of 499 against 129, to defeat an Irish motion for an amendment that would have obliged the Parliament to re - spect the outcome of the Irish referendum. The message here was that no matter how the Irish voted, the European Parlia - ment would stick to its own majority vote of Feb. 20, in favor of the treaty. Opposition Takes to the Streets On the anti-treaty side, in Britain, the “I Want a Referen - dum” cross-party alliance rallied more than 2,000 protesters for a day of action on Feb. 27, with picketing in front of the British Parliament, “test” referenda in ten regions, as well as press conferences and lobbying of Members of Parliament. Those referenda, some of which were held in election districts of three British government members, yielded a majority of up to 90% in favor of a referendum. Therefore, the fact that on March 5, the British Parliament voted against two amend - ments that called for a referendum, one with 311 to 248, with 14 abstentions, and the other with 311 against 247, and 15 ab - stentions, is only a Pyrrhic victory for pro-treaty Prime Minis - ter Gordon Brown and his Labour Party, as the defection of 29 Labourites to the pro-referendum side shows. It is interesting to note that hints are being made about “deratification” being on the agenda, should the opposition Tories come to power in the next election, which is still a year away. That does not stop the treaty in Britain now, but there are probably legal ways left to block the enactment of it, even after ratification. This is also under discussion in other European countries, for example in France, where 1,000 lawyers have filed suit against the treaty with the European Court of Justice in Stras - bourg, and in Germany and Austria, where legal experts are thinking about lawsuits in their own constitutional courts. Two such suits are expected to be filed in Germany by the Linkspartei (Left Party), and by Peter Gauweiler, a conserva - tive Christian Social Union (CSU) party Member of Parlia - Ireland’s Sinn Fein party is circulating this poster in opposition to the European Union’s anti-national treaty."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"38 Strategy EIR March 14, 2008 ment. The moment their suits were admitted by the Constitu - tional Court, German President Horst Köhler would not be legally allowed to sign the Lisbon Treaty, even if it were rati - fied by mid-May, as planned by the government, because the entire case would be pending before the court. The treaty ratification has run into other difficulties in Germany, because the Federal government faces resistance among the state governments, relating to the “accompanying law” which the Merkel Cabinet wants to have passed by the Parliament, in order to have a smooth ratification of the treaty there. But this new law involves questions of Article 23 of the Basic Law (Germany’s constitution), concerning the delicate balance of powers between the Federal and state govern - ments. Therefore, all 16 state governments have declared that they will not ratify the treaty for the time being. Austrian labor unionists issued an appeal on Feb. 26, to all politicians who are also members of a labor union, to recall that in 2004, labor throughout Europe opposed the original EU Constitution draft, on the grounds that it was anti-labor and would lower wages, and to recall that this “no” laid the groundwork for the defeat of the Constitution in referenda in France and the Netherlands in the Spring of 2005. The EU Constitution therefore never went into effect (and was, in fact, resubmitted, as the current EU Treaty). Labor leaders spoke up at a hearing of the Labor and Social Affairs Committee of the European Parliament on Feb. 26-27. The Austrian initia - tive also exposes the threat which the Lisbon Treaty poses to the nation’s neutrality status. In the Netherlands, the opposition Socialists, who hold al - most 25% of the seats in the Parliament, are at the core of a cross-party initiative to pass legislation making a referendum mandatory. The Higher Stakes This resistance to the Treaty is intersected by the interven - tions of the LaRouche movement, which is the only institution making the crucial point that the struggle against the treaty, and against the Bloomberg-Rohatyn Presidential conspiracy in the United States, are one and the same fight. That point is be - ginning to attract more and more interest among anti-treaty activists, as demonstrated at two events at the end of February: The LaRouche BüSo party held a joint German-Austrian event against the Lisbon Treaty, on Feb. 29, together with represen - tatives of the pro-referendum movement of Austria (see ac - companying article). The day before, Helga Zepp-LaRouche gave a presentation on the treaty at an event in Rome (see EIR , March 7). There she exposed the “intertwining of NATO and the European Union” under the solidarity clause of the treaty, placing this in the context of the pro-fascist conspiracies in both the United States and Europe: “If you have a Bloomberg fascist government in the United States and a Lisbon [Treaty] dictatorship in Europe, I have fear that we are on a road to World War III,” she said. Furthermore, her Feb. 14 statement calling for Europeanwide resistance to the treaty, was pub - Conference Report Austrians Push for Referendum on Treaty by Alexander Pusch The independent citizens’ initiative Save Austria convened a first-rate symposium of experts in Vienna on Feb. 27, on whether the European Union Reform Treaty—which Helga Zepp-LaRouche has called the “Monster of Lisbon”— should be submitted to a national referendum in Austria, from a constitutional point of view. The ballroom at the Jus - tice Palace was bursting at the seams: The question of the far-reaching changes in the legal system, which the EU Treaty would signify for all of Europe, is a burning issue for Austrians. The invited experts were former Austrian justice minis - ter Prof. Hans R. Klecatsky, one of the authors of the Aus - trian Constitution; university instructor Dr. Adrian Hol - laender; former Austrian foreign minister Dr. Willibald Pahr; and Dr. Theo Öhlinger, former university professor and author of an expert opinion for the government con - cerning the EU Treaty. Two representatives of the Schiller Institute attended, to help coordinate Europeanwide resis - tance to the further empowerment of the EU bureaucracy, and to promote a strategic understanding of where the dan - ger to our free constitutional order comes from, during this economic crisis. The first theme discussed from the podium, was the elim - ination of Austria’s perpetual neutrality, through its incorpo - ration into the EU. The EU’s Solidarity Clause, which obliges member-states to support one another in “the common battle against terrorism,” de facto means that soldiers of the mem - ber-states could be deployed into battle without their own governments having veto power over it. For Austria, this con - tradicts, without doubt, one of the fundamental principles of the Constitution. This point was argued by Dr. Hollaender, a brilliant young expert in constitutional law, who is vigorously en - gaged in resisting the European Treaty’s obliteration of the national sovereignty of the European member-states. He made eloquent reference to the history of the Austrian Con - stitution. If anyone still doubts the necessity for a referen - dum, he urged them to apply the well-known principle of criminal law, to constitutional law: In Dubio pro Reo (when in doubt, favor the accused), by invoking the principle, In Dubio pro Democracia (when in doubt, favor democracy). Professor Klecatsky made an impassioned plea for the"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"March 14, 2008 EIR Strategy 39 fundamental character of the principle of neutrality in the Austrian constitutional system. In the discussion with the audience that followed, the esteem in which he is held, and his moral authority, were abundantly clear. He received re - peated standing ovations and thunderous applause, particu - larly for his impassioned refutation of the sophistical argu - ment of Professor Ölinger, that by entering the EU, which was done by Austria through a referendum, the country al - ready gave up its neutrality to a large degree, and that there - fore the Reform Treaty is no big change. The discussion then turned to the character of the Reform Treaty as an enabling act or a “blank check.” In this connec - tion, the lawyers also raised the question of the lack of veto power for the individual member-states. Dr. Pahr seconded Dr. Öhlinger sophistry that Austria had already given up its sovereignty, by joining the European Community. They could not understand why the EU Treaty and the opposition’s de - mand for referenda should be creating such an uproar today. Öhlinger further attempted to argue that the four pillars of Austrian constitutional law—namely, the republican princi - ple, the democratic principle, the legal principle, and the fed - eral principle—would not be affected by ratification of the Treaty. Building a Europeanwide Resistance Hollaender and Klecatsky replied, that the danger is that the nations of Europe no longer have any power over how far the changes in the legal system will go. Klecatsky, who lived through and actively shaped the founding of the Aus - trian Republic at the end of the post-war occupation, in 1955, made the point that it is precisely democracy and all democratic legitimacy that would be destroyed by the trea - ty. Hollaender then went into the question of who decides , how far the changes in the legal system would be allowed to go. In a heated discussion, the audience expressed its dis - pleasure at the attempt by the media and the politicians to head off debate, as for example, in the Federal Republic of Germany, where no public debate is being allowed. We of the Schiller Institute intervened at this point, to in - dicate some of the strategic background to this Monster of Lisbon. Many people are particularly perplexed by the haste and furtiveness with which this Treaty is supposed to be rati - fied, behind the backs of the population. As Lyndon LaRouche and Helga Zepp-LaRouche have frequently pointed out, it is vital to understand that the Lis - bon Treaty is a project of the London financial oligarchy, to consolidate dictatorial structures in parallel in the U.S.A. and Europe, because of the breakdown of the financial sys - tem. In the U.S.A., this is expressed in the candidacy of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg; in Europe, it is the EU Reform Treaty. Thus it is important to coordinate Eu - ropewide resistance to it. It was pointed out that, in Ireland, the only country so far, where a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty has been announced, only 26% of the population supports the Treaty. In Denmark, there is an intense discus - sion of the need for a referendum; in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, there is resistance in parliament, and in England itself, Parliament will vote on whether to have a referen - dum. The movement in Austria is an important component of such Europewide resistance, to overturn the consolidation of power by the financial oligarchy in the EU bureaucracy. Dem - onstrations will be organized, educational efforts will be car - ried out, and legal documents will be introduced, to at least slow down ratification by the National Assembly. Individuals and organizations in the various member- states, which are organizing resistance, can draw strength and inspiration from the fact that they are not alone in their struggle with the EU in their own country, but that together, we are striving for a Europe of the Fatherlands, 1 for the common good, and for freedom. Those who are committed to these ideals, can build upon the resistance that exists in Austria. 1. This phrase of Gen.

First, London is at the center of a drive in the U.S.A. and Europe, for a trans-Atlantic fascist-corporatist consolida - tion by early 2009, with the U.S. Presidential inauguration, and the launching of the new European Presidency, under the terms of the Lisbon Treaty, abolishing sovereign nations in the European Union. The last time that London spon - sored a continental fascist dictatorship over Europe, with the Hitler-Nazi coup d’état of early 1933, the United States went the other way, under the new President, Franklin Del - ano Roosevelt, who revived the American System of politi - cal economy, led a global campaign to defeat fascism, and had every intention of abolishing European colonialism, had he survived the war. Today, London is promoting New York City’s corporat - ist mayor, Michael Bloomberg, as its new Mussolini, and is moving aggressively to assure his inclusion in either the Republican or Democratic ticket in November. The Lon - don-hatched Bloomberg operation is intended to guarantee that the United States, this time, goes with Hitler and Mus - solini, not FDR. To achieve this goal within the framework of the ongoing U.S. Presidential race, London must first destroy both Democratic frontrunners, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Obama is the designated instrument to bring down the Clintons, and he is now targeted for his own rapid demise, once that mission has been accom - plished, through the London-orchestrated Rezko-Auchi scandal. Second, London is promoting chaos, war, and ungov - ernability throughout Africa, Southwest Asia, South Asia, and Central and South America, activating longstanding as - sets and methods—to pile up crises beyond the ability of any government to handle. In a speech in Chicago in 1999, then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced this London policy as a “post-Westphalia” world of failed states, supranational intervention, and oligarchical power. Ultimately, a new European super-state would launch rearmament and prepare for World War III, taking aim at Russia and China, following the destruction of the last ves - tiges of the American republic. The London Economist’ s chief Russia attack-dog, Edward Lucas, recently spelled out the parameters of a “New Cold War” against Moscow, in a book that is being widely promoted in Europe and the Americas ( The New Cold War: Putin’s Russia and the Threat to the West ). And a recent edition of the Economist , commemorating the 50th anniversary of the European Union, announced plans to bring down the United States and restore European oligarchical world domination. All of these London-centered schemes are being pur - sued at breakneck speed now, due to the accelerating col - lapse of the world financial and monetary system, a col - lapse that began in full force by the middle of 2007, and has accelerated ever since. For London, the solution to this fi - nancial meltdown is genocidal war, and the establishment of a global monetary dictatorship, in the hands of private offshore financial interests. However, none of these efforts are new. Since the de - feat of London’s Confederacy, in 1865, and despite the as - sassination of President Abraham Lincoln, the British oli - garchy, often in league with continental European like-minded factions, has pursued the destruction of the United States from within, utilizing three principal treason factions—the Boston Brahmins, the Wall Street Tories, and EIR International"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"March 14, 2008 EIR International 41 the heirs of the Southern slavocracy. What is new, is the ferocity of the London drive for worldwide empire and war, and the intensity of the cam - paign to bring down the United States once and for all. A World of Trouble An updated survey of the major global hotspots confirms the charac - ter of the London-centered drive. None of these crises are of regional origin; they all stem from British global opera - tions, aimed at a singular effect: plunging the planet into a New Dark Age, akin to what destroyed Europe in the 14th Century. In Southwest Asia, London has activated longstanding irregular warfare assets—at precisely the moment that there was a glimmer of hope for progress on peace, in the aftermath of the Annapolis, Md. peace conference of November 2007. Muslim Brotherhood factions within the Hamas organization intensified rocket attacks into Israel, from the Gaza Strip in recent weeks, virtually assuring, by profile, an Israeli Defense Forces invasion of Gaza, which is seen as a prelude to a much larger military operation later in the year. London’s ability to play off both Islamist and Israeli Jabotinskyite assets is an old story, but one that continues to block any serious efforts towards comprehen - sive peace, and has the po - tential to blow up the entire region. Also in Southwest Asia, London’s long-term “Greater Kurdistan” project has in - flamed the situation in north - ern Iraq and neighboring Tur - key. In recent weeks, another series of terrorist provoca - tions by the Kurdish People’s Party (PKK), provoked Turk - ish military incursions into the Kurdish region of north - ern Iraq. London’s Kurdish operation targets Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria—all areas where Kurdish separatist in - surgents are on call to unleash chaos. And Saudi Arabia, a close ally of London and a leading promoter and financier of the spread of Wahhabi funda - mentalism throughout South - west and South Asia, has been pressing the Bush Ad - ministration to prepare puni - tive military action against Syria, over Syria’s refusal to acquiesce to Riyadh’s and Washington’s demands to “butt out” of Lebanon. An American Naval expedition - ary force is now in the east - ern Mediterranean, adding fuel to the regional fires. Sources in Washington warn that Vice President Dick Cheney, an asset of London, is once again promoting a U.S. bombing campaign against Iran, before the Bush Adminis - tration leaves office. The latest pretext for such a preventive war? Claims that Iran provided rockets to Hamas and Pales - tinian Islamic Jihad, to hit targets inside Israel. In short, all of Southwest Asia is on the edge of regional war, with London sitting back and watching the fireworks. In the Balkans, bordering Russia, a similar separatist/ terrorist operation is being engineered, to blow up that fault- line region. Kosovo’s recent unilateral declaration of inde - pendence—and the subsequent endorsement by a mad U.S. President George W. Bush, and several leading European states—including Gordon Brown’s Great Britain—of that illegal independence, threatens to unleash a new Balkan war, by means of which Russia could easily be drawn into confrontation with the West (see accompanying article). President of Ecuador A British set-up: Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, London’s “latter-day Simón Bolívar,” has been promoting the narcoterrorist FARC in Colombia, which held hostage Clara Rojas (shown here, with Chávez), along with many others. Chávez’s grandstanding over the hostages set the stage for the most recent eruption of crisis in the region. The Colombian military attacked a FARC safe-haven across the border with Ecuador, killing guerrilla leader Raúl Reyes—Wall Street’s friend. Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa is shown below, at a March 3 news conference protesting the Colombian incursion. (Colombia apologized.) Agencia Bolivariana de Noticias"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"42 International EIR March 14, 2008 Such actions, compounded by the planned stationing of U.S. ballistic missile defense installations in Poland and the Czech Republic, and Britain’s constant stream of hate pro - paganda against outgoing Russian President Vladimir Pu - tin, are fueling a future military confrontation, once again, in the heart of Eurasia. A New War of the Pacific In South America, as detailed below, London is activat - ing a longstanding scenario-on-call for provoking border wars—this time involving Venezuela and Colombia, and potentially drawing in Ecuador, Nicaragua, Chile, and Argentina. As Lyndon LaRouche warned at the beginning of the year, London reacted violently to the inauguration of the Bank of the South, knowing that it was modeled on LaRouche’s own 1982 blueprint for Ibero-American inte - gration and development, Operation Júarez. To kill off the Bank of the South, London activated their latter-day Simón Bolívar, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, to promote the narcoterrorist FARC insurgency against Colombia. When Colombian military forces launched operations against FARC safe-havens along the Colombia-Ecuador border, Chávez stepped in, with a Jacobin outburst that set the entire region into conflict. As of this writing, the situa - tion is precarious. Key to the South American destabilization is London’s Dope, Inc. operations, which have built up a cocaine-based underground economy, that fuels insurgency through bil - lions of dollars in dirty money. Washington sources report that under Chávez, Venezuela has become a major port-of- exit for cocaine, while the country’s oil revenues have been used, in turn, to further bankroll a spreading narco- insurgency, aimed at breaking up several nations. The vast funds generated by the narco-economy—estimated to be well-beyond $1 trillion annually—ultimately flow into Anglo-Dutch offshore financial havens, which, in turn, fuel the assault on sovereign governmental control over currency and credit. According to U.S. intelligence sources, recent inter - cepted communications between top FARC commanders and European government ministers, have opened some eyes in Washington to the London-led European assault against the United States, an assault abetted from within the U.S.A. by the antics of the Bush Administration, and such London loyalists as Felix Rohatyn and George Shultz, who openly extol the British East India Company model of pri - vate mercenary armies, and oligarchical control over world finance. Will patriotic U.S. institutions rally, in time, to defeat the onrushing drive for war and fascism, coming out of London? Will these institutions take LaRouche’s lead, and line up with other leading sovereign world powers—Russia, China, India—to amass the forces to defeat the British empire once and for all? The Kosovo Crisis British Move To End Sovereign Nation-State by Elke Fimmen As Lyndon LaRouche warned last December, when the UN Se - curity Council split on the issue of independence for Kosovo, the principle at stake is the sovereign nation-state, which was established with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Now, after the province of Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on Feb. 17, and after Serbian protests in Belgrade and northern Kosovo, the full dimensions of the consequences of this Brit - ish-orchestrated crisis are unfolding. This includes a Western course of increasing confrontation with Russia, as well as a spi - ralling effect, to activate so-called “frozen conflicts” around the world—with dangerous repercussions for the integrity of na - tional sovereignty, both in Europe and worldwide. At an informal Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) Summit in Moscow on Feb. 22, Russian President Vlad - imir Putin described the recognition of Kosovo’s unilateral declaration by several major world powers as a “terrible prec - edent.” He warned it would “break up the entire system of in - ternational relations, a system that has not taken just decades, but centuries to evolve,” leading to a “whole chain of unpre - dictable consequences.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had stressed earlier, in a phone call to U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, that the “consequences of inde - pendence for Kosovo can lead to the destruction of world or - der and stability.” And a commentary in RIA Novosti on Feb. 22 correctly pointed out that, “the world is swiftly being driv - en away from the Westphalian order of international rela - tions,” which, in the 17th Century, “had stopped half a century of religious wars in Europe and provided for the basic princi - ple of national sovereignty—the territorial integrity and non- interference with the domestic affairs of the sovereign states.” In answer to a e-mail question from an ethnic Albanian Macedonian citizen, in late February, Lyndon LaRouche had underlined the fact, that the push for unilateral independence was “an entirely British imperial operation,” in which “nomi - nally U.S. assets,” such as Richard Holbrooke and the “H.G. Wells-legacy of his former boss, Madeleine Albright” have been used. As if to prove that point, Holbrooke blamed Russia for backing “extremist elements” who were inciting violence in Belgrade, a claim which was rejected by the U.S. State De - partment. The Foreign Ministry in Moscow issued a sharp re - buttal to Holbrooke’s statements."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"March 14, 2008 EIR International 43 Russia, of course, well remembers the role of Holbrooke and Albright in orchestrating the completely unnecessary 1999 NATO-led war against Yugoslavia over the issue of Kosovo—which Tony Blair in a speech in Chicago, in the middle of that war, glowingly portayed as the precedent of his new doctrine of imperial “liberal interventionism,” which would end the era of sovereign nation-states forever. Reactions to the declaration of independence by Kosovo in other areas of the world, where national sovereignty is disput - ed, were immediate, including in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two “frozen conflicts” in the Transcaucus, which had declared (unrecognized) independence from Georgia in 1991, and which lean towards Russia. Chechnya welcomed the Kosovo developments as supporting its own struggle against Russia. The Basque independence movement declared, that Kosovo was “a lesson“ for them, and Flemish “foreign minister” Geert Bourgeois of the N-VA party, which wants to separate from Belgium, announced it would send a delegation to Kosovo, “to explore common means” to develop their institutions. In China, the Chinese Foreign Office criticized the recog - nition of Kosovo by Taiwan, and disputed its authority to do so. This, on the backdrop of a referendum to take place on March 22, on whether the island should be recognized by the UN as “Taiwan.” In the Islamic world, in addition to other problems, inter-communal conflicts are in constant danger of being activated (e.g., problems with Berber unrest in Moroc - co and Algeria, large or significant Shi’ite populations in Bah - rein, Saudi-Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE). And in Bolivia, President Evo Morales warned in a speech Feb. 19, that an “autonomy referendum” of four federal states inside Bolivia could lead to a “Kosovo-style division of the country.” In the Wings: More British-Led Provocations Kosovo was—and still is—subject to UNMIK (United Nations Mission in Kosovo), which bases itself on UN Secu - rity Council Resolution 1244, being supported by up to 17,000 KFOR (NATO) troops. Now, the situation is becoming blurred, as to who is legally responsible. Russia, and of course, Serbia, completely dismiss the legality of the planned EU - LEX (EU Rule of Law) mission, according to which 2000 Eu - ropean Union “experts”—policemen, judges, and other ad - ministrative personnel—are to be deployed, to “assist” the Kosovo institutions, starting formally in June. The real inten - tion behind pushing the Kosovo authorities to declare inde - pendence quickly, instead of contuining to struggle for a joint solution with Serbia, was thus clearly, to put a “government” in place as quickly as possible, which then could “invite” the EU, since the only legal road to move forward, through the Security Council, was blocked. According to the plans of EUPT, the European Union Planning Team, headed by former British diplomat Roy Reeve, the EU and its EULEX mission shall take over major responsibilities from UNMIK. Reeve vehemently denies that the EU mission is creating another “protectorate.” Reeve is a good example of how British establish control mechanisms over crucial geostrategic areas. As a Soviet specialist, he worked for the British diplomatic service from 1966-99, was stationed in the British Embassy in Moscow from 1968-71, and was a member of the British delegation to the Geneva Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE, now OSCE) from 1978-81. Then, he headed Political Affairs in Northern Ireland (1983-85); and after other assignments in South Africa and Australia, he was, from 1995-99, British am - bassador to Ukraine. After his early retirement from diplo - matic service, from 1999-2003, he headed the OSCE Office in Yerevan, Armenia, after which he led the OSCE mission to Georgia, before being appointed in December 2007 to be head of EUPT for Kosovo. Reeve’s prior appointments to Georgia and Armenia are significant, since these crucial areas, which have their own ethnic-breakaway situations, are now responding to Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence. The OSCE mission, which Reeve led in Georgia, also monitored the sensitive bor - der between Georgia and the Chechen Republic, as well as the border with Ingushetia and Dagestan. The strong resistance by Russia has apparently now thrown a monkey wrench into the scheme to push through the planned EU mission. UNMIK, even if it wished to, will not be able to simply hand over responsibility, because a UN Security Coun - cil decision is necessary for its mission to formally end, and Russia insists on this. Now, in an obvious attempt to further circumvent the missing legal basis for the EU mission, and to “create facts on the ground,” an “International Steering Group” (ISG) was constituted in Vienna on Feb. 29, supposedly to guide the development of Kosovo’s institutions according to the so-called “Ahtissari plan” for international “supervised in - dependence.” But this has already been rejected by Serbia, Russia, and China. This group has no legal mandate, and is State Department/Michael Gross Kosovo’s declaration of independence threatens to spark a new Balkan war, which could draw Russia into confrontation with the West.

So far, 15 EU and NATO countries have joined, including the former Kosovo contact group (minus Russia)—the United States, Germany, France, Italy, and Great Britain. Also partici - pating in the ISG so far are Austria, Sweden, the Czech Repub - lic, Slovenia, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland, Belgium, and Turkey. Even Australia and Japan have been invited, in an ob - vious attempt, to create the illusion of a broad international support, UN-style! Designated to run the show for the ISG in Kosovo, is EU special envoy, Dutch diplomat Pieter Feith. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Kamynin im - mediately called the ISG “contradictory to UN decisions” and said, this move could have “unpredictable consequences.” Ahtisaari, former UN envoy for Kosovo, had early on re - jected further negotiations between Kosovo and Serbia and pushed for independence from Serbia. The former President of Finland wrote an article in October 2007 on “empowering Europe,” by greatly strengthening the EU’s foreign policy, es - pecially to confront the “belligerent” Russia of President Vladimir Putin. His co-writers were former German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who had forced German support for the NATO-war against Yugoslavia in 1999 (which paved the way for future German military involvement outside of NATO-territory), and two other imperial-minded representa - tives of the newly founded European Council on Foreign Re - lations (ECFR), including Mark Leonard, a close collaborator of Tony Blair. Pieter Feith, in a interview in Kosovo TV in early March, tried to avoid concrete answers to an impatient Kosovo-Alba - nian interviewer, about what exactly the EU and ISG presence would look like. However, according to reliable reports, the situation for the Kosovo-Albanians, many of whom of course had hoped for self-government, will now become even worse than before. Under UNMIK, each ministry and institution had “advisors” in their offices, most of them British. Now, accord - ing to reliable reports, Feith plans to assume a position of co - lonial viceroy, by having all laws and regulations placed be - fore him, before any action can occur at all. Under these plans, Kosovo will be reduced to the misery of an ever more impov - erished free-trade zone in a globalized world, playing a sub - servient role in an imperial EU-NATO structure. The very fact that all of this is happening in Europe, de - spite the refusal of EU countries, such as Spain, Greece, Slo - vakia, and Cyprus, to recognize the statehood of Kosovo, is a scandal in itself. It gives a foretaste of the even more dictato - rial manner, in which future political and military decisions are to be pushed through in Europe, were the Lisbon Treaty to be ratified, as well as of the character of the planned new post of a “high representative of foreign policy” for Europe. Russia Avoids Confrontational Course Russia, which at present upholds the principles of inter - national law, fortunately, has not let itself be pulled into a confrontation modus operandi , which obviously British geopoliticians are hoping for. Military options have been categorically ruled out by Russia, and Moscow has also warned Belgrade against military actions. For the time be - ing, the Serbians will try to opt for intensifying links to their ethnic minority in northern Kosovo. It is unclear, how far this will go, also in light of the shaky government coalition in Belgrade. There are warnings from the Russian side, that a split along ethnic lines of the heavily Serbian-populated northern Kosovo is already playing out. Indicative of this were recent announcements by the Serbian state railway company to retake control over the northern Kosovo rail - road connections. In the region itself, Russia seems to give emphasis to the economic aspect. In a brief visit to Belgrade on Feb. 26 by Foreign Minister Lavrov and Dmitri Medvedev, outgoing CEO of Gazprom, and now the newly elected President, even offered options for reconciliation between Serbs and Kos - ovar-Albanians in the context of infrastructure projects in the Balkans, for example in the natural gas sector. Medvedev and Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica signed a draft agreement on the South Stream project, a gas pipeline trans - porting natural gas from Russia to Italy, through Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, and Austria. Medvedev stressed that taking Serbia on board, was important to make “the project feasible, complete, fruitful, and mutually beneficial,” and “particularly important, as regards the situation in Serbia today.” He said, this was “essentially an element of our moral, material, and economic aid to the state.” Kosovo is also invited to take part in the project, which would improve and secure its gas supply. On Feb. 28, a contract on the South Stream project was also signed with Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany, following talks with Putin in Moscow. The South Stream project plans to transport 10 billion cu - bic meters of Russian gas annually across the Black Sea, with the first deliveries scheduled for 2013. Jointly built by Gaz - prom and Italy’s Eni, South Stream is a rival project to the Nabucco pipeline backed by the EU and U.S., which would pump Central Asian gas to Europe via Turkey, bypassing Rus - sia. That project also involves Bulgaria, Romania, and Hun - gary, but as they are frustrated over the slow progress of the Nabucco project, they decided to take part in South Stream at the same time. The fact, that they would not join the anti-Rus - sia policy of the EU, has much enraged the European bureau - cracy which insists on “either, or.” Thus, the lines for Europe in the Balkans are clearly drawn. Will its nations submit to becoming a “post-modern” empire along British geopolitical dictates—or, as EU-advisor Jacques Rupnik at a recent conference in Paris said, “a substi - tute for an empire”? European nations, on the other hand, can still adopt LaRouche’s perspective of Eurasian-wide econom - ic development of sovereign nation-states, in the context of a “New Bretton Woods” agreement, thus averting the steep fall into a new dark age."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"March 14, 2008 EIR International 45 Lyndon LaRouche on March 5 denounced the British attempt to orchestrate a regional war across South America, as part of their international strategy of “globalizing” the sovereign na - tion-state out of existence, and imposing fascism under condi - tions of the ongoing disintegration of the world financial sys - tem. The first and foremost target of the British financial oligarchy, LaRouche explained, is the United States itself, as seen in their desperate effort to impose the two-bit, coy Mus - solini, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, as the next President of the United States—over the political corpses of all the current candidates of both parties. “The same people who want to turn the management of the U.S. over to Wall Street,” LaRouche elaborated, “are also meddling in the hemisphere, to put in jeopardy the unity of the Americas around the Bank of the South initiative,” which is a step in the direction of building a new international financial architecture free of the current sinking system. The reactions from many South American governments to the Colombian government’s March 1 cross-border raid against a camp of the narcoterrorist FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) inside Ecuadorian territory—an attack in which FARC kingpin Raúl Reyes was killed, along with 16 others—play right into the British hand, LaRouche said. “The British employ foolish statements by people as ways of caus - ing trouble. That’s the way you manipulate history, by using the foolishness of the people themselves against them.” “Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez is a British asset,” LaRouche went on, “and declared himself to be one,” both by calling for the dollar and the United States to be destroyed, and by endorsing the FARC drug cartel as a supposedly le - gitimate group which should be granted “belligerent” status under the Geneva Treaty—a clear violation of Colombian sovereignty. Various voices across South America have protested against Colombia’s violation of Ecuadorian territory in the March 1 raid. LaRouche commented: “The issue of national sovereignty is that you can not, on the one hand, claim that a terrorist drug-running operation has national sovereignty. If governments allow an international terrorist organization such as the FARC to use their territory, then they have no complaint when the aggrieved government takes action at the border. The question is: Were the govern - ments involved willing to back, and cooperate with, Colom - bia on preventing their own borders from being used as a safe- haven for terrorists? “This is a fascist, drug-pushing organization, of the same type which is causing great distress in Southwest Asia. And they are tightly linked to Wall Street and other international financial interests, that run the drug trade from the top. And therefore you cannot complain, unless you are willing to cooperate when a government finds that a major terrorist threat is using a nearby country as a staging area for terrorist attacks. You have to coop - erate with that country, some way or another, or you have to turn a blind eye to the fact that they crossed your border.” As for Colombia, LaRouche continued, “You have to make sure that everybody understands that you’re going to do some - thing, but you are going to do it in a way which has no bad in - tention toward the country whose borders you may be bruising, because the terrorists are occupying part of their territory.” For that reason, LaRouche stated that he disagreed with statements issuing from certain quarters in Colombia, such as the Santos family’s El Tiempo newspaper, justifying the attack on the grounds of the British doctrine of “limited sovereignty.” “We don’t agree with that at all. But, the fact is this is a drug-financed international terrorist operation which has been killing innocent victims all over the place, and there is no ex - cuse for failing to recognize that governments that are threat - ened by these people should get cooperation from other gov - ernments in doing something about these cross-border operations. When one government, by inability or otherwise, allows its territory to be used for terrorist operations against the people of another country, they do not have immunity.” If the Colombian government truly wants to defuse the British effort to induce regional warfare, LaRouche noted, why don’t they release the documentation from Raúl Reyes’s captured computers on his infamous 1999 meeting in the jun - gles of Colombia with Richard Grasso, then head of the New York Stock Exchange? At that meeting, Wall Street cemented its alliance with the FARC for “mutual investments,” with a jungle embrace between Reyes and Grasso, which became known as the “Grasso Abrazo.” LaRouche returned to Britain’s strategic objective in South America. “The issue here is the Bank of the South, which is an institution to be defended. The issue is, Venezue - la’s oil has been a significant factor in building for the unity of South America,” including helping Ecuador and Argentina survive when they fought the financial system which was kill - ing them. “And now, Chávez has gone crazy, which is not sur - prising to us, knowing his background. He is being played by the British. He is protecting, defending terrorists, as if they had some kind of sovereignty, by calling them revolutionar - ies, and calling for their being granted belligerent status. This is absolutely stupid. It is the best way to break up the Bank of the South, which is why it’s happening. These forces pulling Chávez’s strings are now out to break up the very thing he helped to create,” LaRouche concluded. LaRouche Hits British Plot vs. South America"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"46 International EIR March 14, 2008 Raúl Reyes and The ‘Grasso Abrazo’ Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez went on national televi - sion on March 2, to call for a minute of silence for that “great revolutionary,” Raúl Reyes, operations and finance chief of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), who had been killed by Colombian military forces the day before. Wall Street was less public in its mourning, but it had long ago claimed Chávez’s “great revolutionary” as their man. On June 29, 1999, then-president of the New York Stock Exchange, Richard Grasso, called a press conference on the floor of the Exchange, to announce that after an “ extraordi - nary ” meeting with Reyes, in their southern jungles of Colom - bia, Wall Street had struck a pact with the FARC for a mutual exchange of capital between their two organizations, just as soon as “peace” could be arranged, at terms acceptable to the FARC. My visit, he declared, “will mark the beginning of a new relationship between the FARC and the United States.” The embrace ( abrazo ), pictured here, which sealed the pact between Grasso and Reyes, was posted on the website of then-President Andrés Pastrana. EIR published it on the cover of its July 16, 1999 issue, along with the transcript of Grasso’s shameless press conference, as part of an explosive package titled, “The IMF and Wall Street Are Gunning for Drug Legal - ization.” The photo quickly became infamous worldwide as “the Grasso abrazo .” Grasso proclaimed that the pact with Reyes exemplified Wall Street’s strategy of being “very aggressive in trying to pursue international markets and opportunities.” This was a big opportunity, indeed. The FARC was then, and is still, the dominant drug cartel in Colombia, the world’s leading producer of coca and its derivates, crack and cocaine. In February 2001, Colombian military operations seized no less than 12 cocaine laboratories under the control of the FARC in the southern Guaviare region alone, producing two tons of cocaine a week. Not surprisingly, Grasso discovered that Reyes was “ very sophisticated . . . and he knew a lot about investment and capi - tal markets, and the need to stimulate outside capital coming to Colombia.” The chief of operations of Colombia’s leading dope traffickers was indeed “very interested in how Colom - bian companies could come to the U.S., and raise capital to be invested in the country,” Grasso gushed to reporters. “I invited Comandante Reyes and the [FARC] Supreme Commander [Manuel “Sureshot” Marulanda] to walk the trading floor with me, and I hope that when they do accept that invitation, they’ll have the firsthand experience of what we talked about on Saturday,” said Grasso. “Again, to un - derscore: This was a very, I believe, sophisticated leader. I think that Raúl Reyes— Comandante Reyes—is quite knowledgeable, and very much interested in coming and seeing this firsthand. Perhaps meeting many of you.” The Wall Street Journal was ready, writing in a June 29 editorial: “Mr. Reyes . . . is profitable, he’s glob - al and he’s strategically positioned. Stay tuned, the NYSE chairman is said to have offered the guerrilla a floor tour of the exchange. What’s next, an IPO?” Over the next year, international CEO’s would follow Grasso, and meet with Reyes and other top nar - coterrorists in the Switzerland-sized protected enclave they had been giv - en in Colombia.

This would be the first time that Putin has accepted the invitation for this an - nual NATO summit. It is evident, however, that Russia is not prepared to give NATO a blank check. On March 3, Russian Ambassador to Kabul Za - mir Kabulov told the BBC’s Persian service that the United States and NATO must use their presence in Afghanistan only to fight terrorism, and not for regional political or economic purposes. “We see the military presence of armed forces of the United States and NATO . . . in Afghanistan just in the framework of our common campaign against terrorism,” Kabulov said. Attack on Yeshiva Could Ignite Messianic Struggle The attack on the Mercaz Harav seminary (yeshiva) in Jerusalem by a Palestinian man on March 6, which left eight students dead, could escalate the conflict in the re - gion. This is the number one Zionist-na - tionalist yeshiva, founded in 1924 by Rab - bi Abraham Isaac Kook, and later operated by his son, Ravvi Zvi Yehuda Kook. Many of the most extreme messianic Zionist rab - bis came from this yeshiva, and the radical settlement movement Gush Emunim has its roots there. EIR published a profile of the Merkas Harav yeshiva in its Special Report of December 2000, Who Is Spark - ing a Religious War in the Middle East? documenting that the “Kook” operation was run from the start by British oligarchi - cal networks. According to Ynet, there are now fears that radical settlers will take revenge that could lead to even more violence. The Jeru - salem attack took place just at the time when Egypt was trying to mediate a ceasefire be - tween Israel and the Palestinians; in fact representatives of Hamas and Islamic Jihad were meeting in Egypt at the time. The head of the yeshiva, Rabbi Ya’akov Shapira, speaking at the funeral attended by thousands, declared the attack “a continua - tion of the 1929 massacres” and said, “The time has come for all of us to understand that an external struggle is raging, and an internal struggle, and everyone believes that hour has come . . . for us to have a stron - ger leadership, a more believing leader - ship. . . .” People at the funeral chanted “death to the Arabs.” Will Blackwater Enter Pakistan’s Tribal Areas? Speaking to the Italian news agency AKI in - ternational in Karachi on March 5, Paki - stan’s former chief of Inter-Services Intelli - gence (ISI), and one of the mentors of the Afghan Taliban movement, Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul, said: “Seven hundred and fifty Ameri - can commandos will participate in upcom - ing military operations in the Pakistani trib - al areas. . . . I confirm this to you on the basis of my information that those American commandoes will be sent through private contracting firms like Blackwater, and they will supervise the whole operation.” Black - water is the private security firm that has been at the center of controversy over the brutality of private contractors in Iraq. Gul revealed this on the same day that a suicide attack on a government office guard - ed by Afghan and NATO troops in eastern Afghanistan left two alliance soldiers dead and four more wounded, a U.S. military spokesman said. Although the arrival of the U.S. com - mandos in Pakistan was reported earlier, it was not clear that the decision had been reached to move into the tribal areas, de - spite opposition by the local population and the PML(N) political party (led by Nawaz Sharif, the party was the second-largest vote-getter in Pakistan’s Feb. 18 elections). The PML(N) calls the U.S. intervention a violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty. It is evident that the decision to send the U.S. commandos was decided earlier, and that the U.S. Centcom chief, Adm. Mike Mullen, who was in Islamabad, holding talks with President Pervez Musharraf and Army Chief Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, was there to in - form the Pakistanis. Mullen “is here to con - tinue developing the relationship military- to-military and to discuss a range of bilateral issues of mutual concern, including regional security,” U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Eliz - abeth Colton told AFP.

By the end of the evening, it was evi - dent that a majority of Democrats in Ohio and Rhode Island, as well as a majority of those who cast ballots in the Texas Demo - cratic primary (which included Republi - cans—see box) responded to that demon - stration of leadership, as she won decisive victories in those states. Her victories oc - curred despite consistently hostile media coverage, with many pundits insisting she should drop out of the race, for the sake of “party unity,” as well as pressure from traitorous networks in the Democratic Party, tied to fascist financier Felix Ro - hatyn, which are attempting to undermine her campaign on behalf of the “Bloomberg option.” Senator Clinton won the primaries in Ohio and Rhode Is - land by significant margins (including more than 10% in Ohio), and defeated Sen. Barack Obama in Texas by more than 100,000 votes, out of a record of nearly 2.9 million votes cast.

Evoking the image of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who said he would represent the “forgotten man” in his campaign for President at the peak of the Depression in 1932, Clinton said she would be a voice for the “voiceless,” in fighting for their rights. This point was reiterated forcefully on the eve of the March 4 primaries by senior Clinton campaign advisor Har - old Ickes, on PBS’s “Charlie Rose” show. In making the case that Clinton should stay in the race, Ickes pointed out that with eight months to go before the November election, economic problems will, more and more, be in the forefront of the de - bate. Therefore, nobody should “rush to judgment.” The image of Hillary Clinton as a fighter, who would not back down, or quit in the face of enormous pressure, rallied many voters who were undecided until the last minute, to vote for her. Polls show that she won nearly two-thirds of the votes cast by those who made up their minds in the last four days before March 4. There were two other factors at play, as part of the reality that shaped the environment leading to March 4. First, there was the weak response of Senator Obama to the pummeling, which has just begun, regarding the case of indicted Chicago businessman Tony Rezko, whose trial on corruption charges opened on March 3. LaRouche had pointed to the Rezko case, which is quickly becoming the “Obama case,” as an example of how Bloomberg’s London-based backers intend to dispose of Obama, after the Illinois Senator has knocked Clinton out of the race. Obama, who was used to basking in the adulation of the press, was suddenly placed on the hot seat, and he handled it poorly. He awkwardly fled from reporters during a press con - ference in San Antonio, when he was confronted with contra - dictions between leaks about his relations with Rezko, which had appeared in the British press, and his efforts to deny any substantive ties to Rezko. The other factor is that Bloomberg, despite his prominent denial, in a Feb. 28 op-ed in the New York Times , that he is running for President, is still a candidate—if not for President, then for Vice President. Backers of the would-be Mussolini have inserted his name in lists of potential Vice Presidential candidates for both parties; and the same pundits who are trashing Clinton have been promoting Bloomberg. As La - Rouche had forecast last November, the Bloomberg option would be activated after Rudy Giuliani was dumped, which LaRouche accurately predicted; and, then, after Obama had defeated Clinton, he, too, would be cast aside, clearing the way for Bloomberg. LYM Takes on the Bloomberg Option That Hillary Clinton has acted defiantly in the face of this scenario, to counter it in a manner which was unexpected by Did Texas Republicans Outfox Themselves? Howls have been heard coming from GOP quarters in Houston, as the party’s unofficial strategy—i.e., urging Re - publicans voters to cast ballots in the Democratic primary to aid the weaker of the two Democrats—seems to be back - firing, as the GOP “strategists” are increasingly confused as to which candidate that would be! The idea, which some attribute to Karl Rove, was to throw enough votes to the Democratic candidate (Texas al - lows “crossover” voting) who would be easier to beat in the November general election. More astute Democratic ana - lysts see this as part of the ongoing Bloomberg campaign, to wreak havoc on the Democratic Party in the months lead - ing up to the nominating convention. Working from earlier poll numbers, they thought Obama would be easier to defeat, so some Republicans vot - ed early for Obama; others who voted for Obama were driven by long-term hostility toward the Clintons, hoping they could finish off those pesky Clintons in Texas; still others, like right-wing windbag Rush Limbaugh, have been urging Republicans to vote for Hillary, to defeat Obama. Reports from precincts in solidly Republican areas show a highly disproportionate number voting in the Democratic primary. As voters went to the polls on March 4, leading Repub - licans began to realize that this strategy was backfiring. It seems that these oh-so-clever Republicans were unable to figure out which Democrat was the weaker candidate! There are credible reports that some dismayed Party lead - ers spent the weekend trying to figure out how to convince Republicans to vote in the GOP primary, without spilling the beans about their sly plan to disrupt the Democrats. Rank-and-file GOP voters called local right-wing radio talk shows on the morning of the voting to complain that, after voting for Obama (or Hillary) in the Democratic primary, they discovered they could not vote for Republican candi - dates in the other races on the Republican primary ballot. Exit polls showed that 9% of the votes cast in the Texas Democratic primary were cast by self-identified Republi - cans. Of these, 52% voted for Obama. —Harley Schlanger"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"50 National EIR March 14, 2008 the pundits, is made evident in a column in the March 6 Wash - ington Post by right-wing whiner Robert Novak, with the not- so-ironic title, “Why Clinton Isn’t Dead.” Novak reports that, prior to the March 4 vote, top Democrats were moving to dump Hillary, that “elaborate preparations . . . had been made for her expeditious burial.” These prominent Democrats “were organizing a major private intervention. A posse of par - ty leaders would plead with her to end her campaign and rec - ognize Obama as the Democratic standard bearer.” The plan for deployment of this “death squad”—which would likely have included such Rohatyn cronies as Al Gore and Nancy Pelosi—has been put on hold, as voters responded to Senator Clinton’s leadership on election day. A key role in rallying voters to defeat the Bloomberg op - tion has been the effective deployment of the LaRouche Youth Movement (LYM) in Ohio, Texas, and Rhode Island. The LYM mobilized in Texas under banners which read, “Defeat Bloomberg in the Texas Primary,” while distributing more than 40,000 copies of two leaflets put out by LaRouche PAC on the Bloomberg option: “Mitt Romney Walks Out,” which exposed why London-based financial networks were desper - ately pushing Bloomberg’s candidacy, as a last-ditch effort to destroy the U.S.A., by placing it under a Mussolini-style cor - poratist regime; and “Bloomberg Lies: ‘I Am Not Running,’ Only Dripping Copiously,” which updates the first leaflet, identifying the next phase of the Bloomberg option, to knock out Obama. A similar mobilization by the LYM in Ohio had the same effect as in Texas, causing Democrats to stop and think—“I didn’t know Bloomberg was running,” was a uni - versal response, giving LYM organizers the opportunity to explain to them the Bloomberg option. Both Clinton and Obama supporters responded by saying, “I knew there was something else going on, this election seemed too orches - trated.” That prescience, that there is something wrong, coincid - ed with the widespread unleashing in the press just days be - fore the primary, of the story of the Rezko/Obama case. This confirmed for many that there was, indeed, something big - ger going on: The Bloomberg option was now in the public eye. It was this confluence of events, occuring at the moment when Clinton had, once again, “found her voice,” and demon - strated her commitment to fight for the “forgotten men and women” of America, which offers our nation a chance for sur - vival. Now, it is on to Pennsylvania, the next mega-contest, on April 22, and then, as the Clinton campaign has made clear, the battle will continue to the Democratic convention in Den - ver at the end of August. One thing is certain: Neither the would-be Mussolini, Mayor Bloomberg of New York, nor his close collaborators, such as fascists George Shultz and Felix Rohatyn, are pleased by this turn of events.

LaRouche’s Homeowners and Bank Protection Act (HBPA), the first step towards saving that same U.S. Constitu - tion today. Rhode Island also made history on March 4, by delivering a crushing blow to London’s fascist Bloomberg op - tion, responding to LaRouche’s warning, circulated in a mass leaflet during the days leading up to the March 4 primary, that an Obama victory would only pave the road for a Michael Bloomberg Presidency. Record numbers of Rhode Islanders, mostly among the ranks of the lower 80% of family income- brackets, turned out to vote for Hillary Clinton, thereby block - ing London’s Bloomberg plot. Lyndon LaRouche is not running for President. However, the LaRouche Youth Movement (LYM) has been campaign - ing across the nation to make the issue of a Franklin Roos - evelt-style economic recovery the only issue of the current Presidential campaign. State Rep. Joe Almeida and State Sen. Juan Pichardo, in the face of a severe budget crisis and dete - riorating social and economic conditions, have turned to the LaRouche Political Action Committee as having the only al - ternative to fascist budget-cutting austerity policies, like those typified by “Benito” Bloomberg and California Terminator Arnie Schwarzenegger. LaRouche has long emphasized that if the Democratic Par - ty wishes to survive and to actually save the nation, it must re - turn to their original constituency, the lower 80%, FDR’s “for - gotten men,” or, what LaRouche characterizes as the “sleeping giant.” Both the passage of the HBPA in the Rhode Island Statehouse, and the landslide defeat for Bloomberg in the pri - mary, can only be understood as the waking of that sleeping giant; the nation heard “the voice of the voiceless.” Waking the Sleeping Giant In the days following the Super Tuesday primaries on Feb. 5, both the Obama and Clinton campaigns were scrambling to set up campaign operations on the ground in Rhode Island."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"March 14, 2008 EIR National 51 However, the LYM was already there, cam - paigning for its Presidential candidate, the Ho - meowners and Bank Protection Act.

The LaRouche Youth Movement is actively shaping the policy of the country, defining the political and his - torical identity of our genera - tion. In Rhode Island, as well as in Ohio and Texas, going into the March 4 primary, our focus was to recruit students off of the campuses and into or - ganizing of their elected offi - cials, and to expose the danger of the Bloomberg fascist coup. We generated the greatest ef - fect at Rhode Island College and at Brown University, where our organizing reached a boil - ing point. Days of mass litera - ture distribution, motorcade rallies, and one-on-one political discussion, exposed the stu - dents to the quality of leadership represented by the LYM—the leadership necessary to revive the Franklin Roosevelt legacy. Our campus organizing and policy leadership overlapped in one very ironic moment in the basement of the Rhode Is - land State House. A group of students from Brown University, who had seen us on a street corner earlier that day, were visit - ing the office of the minority caucus for a school project. Rep - resentative Almeida and minority caucus liaison Maria Lopes (a long-term, dedicated pro-LaRouche fighter), interrupted their discussion with these students by enthusiastically intro - ducing members of the LYM, as the authors of Almeida’s HBPA resolution. The students, working for the Obama cam - paign, were flabbergasted that the same young people, who they had seen organizing at a table earlier in the day, were working to make policy in their state government. Weeks lat - er, on the tumultuous primary day, from behind their Obama signs, the same students saw us once again, this time, organiz - ing for the destruction of Bloomberg, just hours before the defeat of Barack Obama in the Rhode Island primary and the triumph of Lyndon LaRouche’s HBPA! This irony is typical of the effect we had on students. At Rhode Island College, the first day of organizing found another “sleeping giant”: the so-called apolitical youth generation. The students were shocked to see any sort of political activity going on at their campus. However, within a few months, the campus was completely politicized. Our strategy: ATTACK MYSPACE! 1 This pulled the students into political reality and a few of them responded by engaging in the intellectual curriculum by attend - ing a LYM weekend cadre school, attempting to replicate in themselves the sort of political leadership they saw in our move - ment.

Yet, what is occurring behind the scenes in the United States during this Presidential campaign is in fact an attempt at a coup d’état, with the intention of inducing the American public to place Bloomberg in the White House. Shakespeare’s play provides a brutally insightful look into the motivations and cutthroat actions that ended with Richard seizing his throne, and a sharp comparison to a similar, albeit seemingly less violent operation today cannot be avoided. When one thinks of Richard III, the name Dick Cheney im - mediately comes to mind, and there are startling similarities be - tween the Vice President and the blood-soaked butcher of Shake - speare’s play. Upon further investigation, the method by which Richard seized power bears a striking resemblance to that cur - rently in progress to put Bloomberg into the White House. Historically, the oligarchical faction, be it the British vari - ety, or its earlier Babylonian or Roman predecessors, has em - ployed the method portrayed in Richard III to impose tyrants on the throne. As Shakespeare chronicled this approach in Ju - lius Caesar and Richard III , the game is to mobilize a foolish, “popular” movement to demand the seating of a dictator, who then proceeds to slit the throats of the people who put him in power. This can be seen in the manipulation of the Roman mob in Julius Caesar , or the deluded Italian mobs that put Mussolini into power in 1922, or the crazed German mobs who rallied to Hitler. Where Richard plotted his own ascent to power, in our real-life drama, the New York Mayor is merely the smiling pawn of desperate, but powerful, British-centered, Wall Street financiers such as Felix Rohatyn, George Shultz, and Michael Steinhardt. Today, a conglomeration of think tanks, money - bags, and Wall Street sharks are moving the pieces into place to stick Bloomberg into the Oval Office. This sleazy apparatus includes the Rockefeller Foundation’s Judith Rodin, the Build America Coalition of Govs. Arnie Schwarzenegger (R-Calif.) and Ed Rendell (D-Pa.). In the 1930s, the fascists were brought to power by a similar group of financier families, including the Rockefellers, Bushes, Harrimans, and Morgans, under the direction of the British monarchy and Bank of England gov - ernor Montagu Norman. The string-pullers intend to eliminate each of the leading candidates, one after another, and while details of the plot are still developing, the ending is already written: to bring Bloom - berg in over the carcasses of the other discarded candidates. Shakespeare’s Hamlet, says about Claudius, the King, who has murdered Hamlet’s father, and married his mother, “He can smile and smile and be a villain,” and the same can be said of Bloomberg. It is important that Americans confront their deep denial that “this kind of thing could happen here,” and their foolish nay-saying “that it could never be that putz Michael Bloomberg.” They must do as Shakespeare com - mands in Julius Caesar , to peer into their souls as to how they have “become underlings,” susceptible to bringing about their own downfall. This brief sketch will highlight the brutal drive for power dramatized in Shakespeare’s Tragedy of Richard III in the hope of provoking the American public to crush the incipient coup before it reaches fruition. Richard III: The Tyrant Stalks the Throne Shakespeare’s drama is focused on Richard’s irrepressible drive to succeed his brother, Edward IV, as King of England. Shakespeare derived his idea from a manuscript by the Re - naissance humanist Thomas More, who pilloried and satirized the last monarch of the War of the Roses. He wastes no time in the opening soliloquy outlining Richard’s first move. “Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous, By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams, to set my brother Clarence and the King In deadly hate, the one against the other; And if King Edward be as true and just As I am subtle, false, and treacherous, This day should Clarence closely be mewed up Both the historical Richard III, and the one portrayed by Shakespeare, seized power by unscrupulous methods that bear a striking resemblance to those now being used, to put Michael Bloomberg in the White House."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"54 National EIR March 14, 2008 About a prophecy which says that ‘G’ Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be. Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. . . .” While pledging his undying love for his brother Clarence, Richard hires two assassins to murder him. While Clarence awaits his fate, Richard moves on to woo Lady Anne, the wid - ow of the son of the previous king, Henry VI. Richard had just killed both the king, and Anne’s husband in war. The conquest of Anne will position him to seize the throne when the expect - ed opportunity arises. “For then I’ll marry Warwick’s youngest daughter. What though I killed her husband and her father? The readiest way to make the wench amends Is to become her husband and her father; The which will I not all so much for lover As for another secret close intent By marrying her which I must reach unto. But yet I run before my horse to market.” Shameless rogue that he is, Richard proposes marriage to Anne when she is at her most vulnerable, at the funeral of her husband, who has just been killed by Richard! Once Anne has fallen under his power, Richard gloats: “Was ever woman in this humor wooed? Was ever woman in this humor won? I’ll have her, but I will not keep her long. What, I that killed her husband and his father, To take her in her heart’s extremest hate, With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes, The bleeding witness of my hatred by, Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me, And I no friends to back my suit at all But the plain devil and dissembling looks? And yet to win her, all the world to nothing! Ha!” Richard now moves to have his brother Clarence murdered, while Clarence remains deep in denial that such a horrible event could be conceived. Clarence continues to believe, all the way to his grave, that Richard loves him and will intervene to save his life from the very assassins sent by Richard to car - ry out his execution. Clarence’s murder becomes the pretext for Richard to pit one faction of the remaining members of the royal family against the other. After the dying Edward IV succeeds in get - ting all factions to reconcile their mutual hatreds and antago - nisms, in a “Westphalian” agreement, the malevolent Richard intervenes to rekindle the oligarchical hatreds. The King fool - ishly blames himself for Clarence’s death, and Richard blames the Queen’s family. This classic oligarchical tactic— divide et impera (di - vide and rule)—is being played out even now in the Presi - dential campaign. Lyndon LaRouche has repeatedly warned that Barack Obama’s campaign is being used to de - stroy the efforts of Hillary Clinton; while on the Republi - can side, the same financiers plan to lower the boom on John McCain. They will finish off the unwitting Obama with ready-made scandals, already brewing. This leaves the door open for Bloomberg’s emergence as the “man on a white horse.” King Edward IV dies a timely death following Richard’s murder of his brother Clarence, and Richard moves forward ruthlessly to fill the power vacuum. He summarily arrests both the Queen’s son and brother, potential impediments to his plan, and has them executed. He does the same with Lord Hastings, his close ally, who nonetheless refuses to support the developing coup d’état. Only unquestioning loyalty will satisfy the usurper. Richard then hatches his next scheme, a series of slanders to be circulated among the populace, vilifying the sons of his brother Edward IV, who are the legitimate heirs to the throne. The analogy to today’s “media brainwashing and slanders” currently deployed against Hillary Clinton, could not be more obvious. Richard dictates the plot to his closest confidant Lord Buckingham: “Go after, after, cousin Buckingham. The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post: There, at your meetest vantage of the time, Infer the bastardy of Edward’s children. Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen Only for saying he would make his son Heir to the Crown—-meaning indeed his house, Which, by the sign thereof, was termed so. Moreover, urge his hateful luxury And bestial appetite in change of lust, Which stretched unto their servants, daughters, wives, Even where his raging eye or savage heart, Without control, lusted to make a prey. Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person: Tell them when that my mother went with child Of that insatiate Edward, noble York My princely father then had wars in France, And, by true computation of the time, Found that the issue was not his begot. . . .” Richard then tells Buckingham that he is recruiting (bribing) several clergymen to pray with him at his residence, and en - courages Buckingham to recruit the gullible townsfolk to view the spectacle of contrition at Richard’s castle. Here they can be mobilized to beg him to accept the Crown. In the meantime, Richard will dispense with his final obstacles, Edward’s two sons, including the designated heir"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"March 14, 2008 EIR National 55 to the throne, Prince Edward. “Now will I go to take some privy order To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight, And to give order that no manner of person Have any time recourse unto the Princes.” Orchestrating the Coup Richard’s initial attempt to mobilize the populace of Lon - don to carry him onto the throne backfires, when the unwilling mob refuses the entreaties of his emissaries. Buckingham’s pleas fall flat, as the people refuse to buy his sales pitch: “Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace, Your bounty, virtue, fair humility; Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose Untouched or slightly handled in discourse. And when mine oratory drew toward end, I bid them that did love their country’s good Cry ‘God save Richard, England’s royal king!’ ” Richard is shocked when the mob fails to give its approval to Buckingham’s proposition. However, Buckingham’s stooges, planted in the crowd, lead a chant endorsing Richard, and this ploy stirs up support. Buckingham grabs the mayor and a few townsmen by the arms and drags them to the castle to meet with Richard, where they plead with him to take the throne. The two evildoers then set the stage. They place Richard between two clergymen; now, Richard is ready to whip up the mob to beg him to accept the crown. Buckingham then drags in the gaggle to meet Richard, who is deep in prayer. Bucking - ham greets them thus: “Ah, ha my lord, this prince is not an Edward! He is not lolling on a lewd love-bed, But on his knees at meditation; Not dallying with a brace of courtesans, But meditating with two deep divines; Not sleeping, to engross his idle body, But praying, to enrich his watchful soul: Happy were England would this virtuous prince Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof. But sure I fear we shall not win him to it.” Richard, flanked by the bishops, feigns surprise when ap - proached by the group as he “prays”; Buckingham begs him to consider taking the crown. In a dialogue filled with deli - cious irony, Buckingham and Richard exchange “holier than thou” pleadings about Richard’s deep religious convictions and the mob’s desire that he become king. Implying that the decent Edward IV was a rogue and scoundrel, who had defaced the throne, the Rohatyn-like Buckingham implores the “coy” Richard to accept the crown. Richard demurs, as Buckingham continues to appeal. Finally, the previously intransigent Mayor interjects and demands that Richard become king. The “flirt” Richard again refuses, and the entire mob leaves the palace, crestfallen. Now, another of Richard’s al - lies, Catesby, emerges from the crowd to implore the bloody duke to assume the title. “Call him again, sweet prince. Accept their suit. If you deny them, all the land will rue it.” Richard responds, “Will you enforce me to a world of cares? Call them again. I am not made of stones, But penetrable to your kind entreaties, Albeit against my conscience and my soul.” After more despicable begging, pleading, and wringing of hands, Richard accepts the crown. His first act is to hire an assassin to murder the young dukes, the true heirs, who had been locked in the Tower of London. The bloodshed continues as the mad king is now free to attack all opponents, real or imagined. As he had earlier promised, Richard has his wife put to death in the midst of the carnage. “But I am in So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin. Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.” Henry VII and the Defeat of Fascism Shakespeare’s play is an unvarnished look at the method of oligarchical control, typical of the feudalism, so admired by the allies of Bloomberg and their European counterparts promoting the fascist Lisbon Treaty. The play is set against the conclusion of the War of the Roses, the “endless war,” pitting the oligarchical houses of Lancaster and York against one an - other, and destroying the country for generations. Happily, the genocidal war is brought to a conclusion with the destruction of Richard at the battle of Bosworth Field. He is slain by Henry Tudor, the Earl of Richmond, who ascends to the throne as Henry VII, who brings the Italian Renaissance to England and France. As LaRouche has warned, nothing short of a thorough overturning of existing axioms, and the defeat of the fascist threat, will deliver this nation and the planet from the tyran - ny. Lurking behind the smiles of Bloomberg and his control - lers lies the same brutal hand that destroyed Europe with fas - cism in the 1930s. It can happen here, but only if we allow it. There is no better time to learn the lessons of Shakespeare’s great tragedy."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"56 Economics EIR March 14, 2008 Save Housing: Put Financial System Into Receivership by John Hoefle You can hardly look at the news these days without hearing about the U.S. housing crisis. Foreclosures are at an all-time high and the rate is accelerating, home prices are falling all across the nation, and the number of homeowners who owe more on their homes than they are worth is rising. This is a national problem which must be solved. At the same time, however, this housing crisis is being used in a heartless and cynical way by the big financial institu - tions, which are seeking to have themselves bailed out under the guise of helping homeowners. Proposals abound in Wash - ington which are aimed at protecting not the homeowners, but the mortgage-holders, and the holders of trillions of dollars of mortgage-backed and mortgage-related securities. Under all the posturing and spin, the American people are being thrown to the wolves by the bankers, in order to protect the fictitious values of speculative financial paper. To sell their bailout, the financiers constructed a phony story about how the subprime problems developed, painting themselves as the victims of unscrupulous subprime lenders and greedy home-buyers. They got away with it because a year ago, when they started pushing this scam, the cracks in the banking system were not nearly so visible as they are to - day. The bankers knew, but the public did not, and the bankers played on that ignorance. One year later, the financial markets are in panic, and the bailout process has begun. If we continue down this road, not only will the housing crisis worsen, but the economy will ex - plode in a hyperinflationary blowout the likes of which the United States has never experienced. Housing Meltdown Bad, and getting worse, sums up the situation for home - owners. Foreclosures rose to a all-time high in 2007, accord - ing to the Mortgage Bankers Association, which noted that 40% of all foreclosures involved people with prime or sub - prime mortgages who walk away from their homes before their adjustable-rate-mortgage interest rates reset, and an - other 23% involved people who walked away from their homes after receiving some sort of beneficial loan modifica - tion. Late payments rose to a 23-year high, with 5.8% of all home loans more than 30 days late, a rate not seen since 1985. Nationally, some 29% of all subprime loans were in trou - ble at 2007 year-end, as were 35% of all adjustable-rate sub - prime loans. Subprime loans accounted for about 13% of the total number of mortgages. Troubles with prime loans are also increasing, with 4.5% of all prime mortgages delinquent or in foreclosure nationally, as were 8.7% of adjustable-rate prime mortgages. The net worth of households fell in the fourth quarter of 2007 for the first time since 2002, decreasing by $533 billion, with housing-related net worth falling by $176 billion, ac - cording to the Federal Reserve. That net loss would have been almost three times bigger, had the Fed used the figures from S&P/Case-Shiller instead of those from the Office of Federal Housing Oversight, according to J.P. Morgan Chase. The drop in housing prices, combined with the refinanc - ing wave of the past several years, means that as a whole, the amount of equity Americans own in their homes has dropped below 50%, Federal Reserve statistics show. Since about 35% of homeowners own their homes outright and have no mort - gages, the 65% who do have mortgages owe a lot more than 50% of their homes’ value.

While foreclosures get most of the press coverage, the ef - fects of the housing crisis are also hitting people who are still making their payments. The exorbitant prices for homes in re - cent years have put many families in the position of having to pay far more for housing than they should, and the combina - tion of high mortgage and rent payments, high gasoline pric - es, and the rising cost of food and other essentials due to the falling value of the dollar, has put households in a terrible bind. The Cause The fact that subprime loans are at the bleeding edge of the housing crisis does not mean that subprime loans were the cause of the housing crisis. For the cause, one has to look at the banking system and the creation of the largest speculative bubble in history. Far from being caused by subprime lenders on the periph - ery of the financial system, the real estate bubble was the cre - ation of Wall Street. The game was to run up real estate values, and use the “wealth” created by the higher valuations as fuel for the bubble. The debt created by the mortgages was then used as the basis for the creation of an even larger market in mortgage-backed securities and even more mortgage-related securities such as collateralized debt obligations and other forms of insanity. As the bubble grew, it required ever larger amounts of fuel, which in turn, required more, and bigger, mortgages. As housing prices rose, they began to outpace the ability of the population to pay the mortgages, so the banks began to loosen loan requirements. Over the last few years, with prices so high that buyers were increasingly difficult to find, the lenders opened the floodgates, issuing adjustable-rate mort - gages, subprime loans, low-documentation loans, no-docu - mentation loans—basically doing whatever they had to do to keep the mortgage debt flowing. By design, and intent, the banking system was selling mortgages to people who could not afford them. The idea that this was the fault of the subprime lenders is a myth, for two main reasons. The first is that the subprime lenders were just middlemen—they originated the loans and then immediately sold them to larger institutions which would combine them in pools for mortgage-backed securi - ties. Had the big banks not bought the loans from the origina - tors, the originators would have quickly run out of capital and ceased to exist. The second reason is that many of the sub - prime lenders were allied with, or even owned by, big banks. This whole business was run by the big commercial and investment banks from the top down, and they in turn fed a steady stream of mortgage-backed paper into the hedge funds, the mutual funds, the money market, pension and other in - vestment vehicles. It was a giant pyramid scheme which was—seemingly—enormously profitable when real estate prices were rising, only to be revealed as an even bigger disas - ter when that price-growth peaked. The homebuyers, far from benefitting from this process, instead found themselves paying huge amounts of money to the bankers through artificially high mortgage prices. Many individuals profitted from this speculative game while it was growing, but from a systemic standpoint, and, after the dust clears, it will be seen as one of the most destructive boon - doggles of all time. Crash, and Bail To casual observers, the cracks in this system began to ap - pear in early 2007, when the banks pulled the plug on the sub - prime lenders and began to portray themselves as victims. That Summer, the cracks split wide open with the Bear Stea - rns hedge fund crisis, and the death of the market for mort - gage-backed securities. As the panic deepened, the market for other asset-backed securities, such as those backed by credit- card receivables, also seized up. By year’s end, the whole se - curitization system had ground to a virtual halt, and the cen - tral banks were pumping liquidity like crazy, keeping the system on life-support. With the new year came the next phase, the banking crisis; though called a “credit crunch,” the real problem was insol - vency , among banks with huge amounts of worthless paper on their books. Now, things have deteriorated to the point that the talk about the insolvency of the banking system is out in the open, and the Federal government is openly discussing measures designed to save financial institutions. It is a far cry from a year ago, when all the experts were confidently assuring us that everything was under control, that the damage from the mortgage sector was containable. Today, the public state - ments are even more foolish, and far less confident. Panic is in the air, as is the toxic smell of a bailout. Have no illusions about what is happening. The interna - tional banking crowd is doing what it always does in such circumstances, which is to dump as much of the losses as possible on the public. The bailout schemes before Con - gress vary slightly, but all have the goal of having the Fed - eral government, and the U.S. taxpayer, buy the bad paper from the banks, so that the public takes the hit. Given the enormous amounts involved and the pitiful state of the U.S. physical economy, such a move would not only destroy the economy, but trigger a hyperinflationary collapse of the dollar, which would spread worldwide. It is insane, and it is coming, unless we stop it. If you think you have problems now, just wait. Better still, help LaRouche pass the Home - owners and Bank Protection Act and put a stop to the bank - ers’ insane wet dream.

The transportation deals shown, promoted as the means to provide desperate states and localities with cash, are warmed-over versions of dictator Benito Mussolini’s infra - structure schemes of the 1920s and 1930s. His hallmark projects were deals which gave his cronies 50-year rights to tolls, and guaranteed both government funding and expro - priation of land for highways. In 1922, as soon as he was installed as Italy’s Fascist Premier, Mussolini gave his friends the concession for the Milano-Laghi Autostrada, in northern Italy. U.S. states traditionally were prohibited from allowing such looting of public assets. State laws, as well as the Consti - tution, prevented it. But over the past ten years, 24 states have lifted prohibitions. In 2006, Lyndon LaRouche denounced this process as going over to “Mussolini Laws,” saying, if Mussolini is here, can Hitler be far behind? Now, with the financial crash in full swing, Rohatyn et al. are making an all-out drive for fascist economics. The week of March 10, Rohatyn will personally testify to the Senate, and meet with House Democrats, on his infrastructure-grab plans. Besides outright looting, Rohatyn’s intention is to end government sovereignty and responsibility for the public good. Instead, as he wrote in an article March 7, government funds should be “leveraged” to facilitate the involvement of private capital and control. Other cover-up jargon for priva - teer asset-grabs include, “investor concessions,” or PBIs (Per - formance Based Infrastructure), a favorite of Governator Ar - nold Schwarzenegger. Well over 100 major new infrastructure sell-off projects are now before legislatures and local govern - ments. The two major highway routes targetted by the privateers are among the heaviest traffic corridors in the world for poten - tial tolls: The 1,000-mile long east-west corridor, from Chi - cago to the Eastern Seaboard; and the transit routes through Texas, where all the north-south NAFTA traffic is channeled. In addition, California has many of the world’s busiest lanes for potential tolls. They’ve Got To Steal It Major players in the takeovers are the Australia-headquar - tered Macquarie Infrastructure Group, and its related partner, the Spain-based Cintra Concesiones de Infraestructuras de Transporte, S.A., part of Ferrovial. Behind these firms are the financial circles of the global oligarchy, including Royal Dutch Shell, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Banco Santander, Lazard, Lehman, and others. In the scramble for fast loot, a few equity funds stand out: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and the Carlyle Group. These are the very circles—especially economic hitman George Shultz—behind the “Rebuilding America’s Future,” of Schwarzenegger (R), Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell (D), and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg (I), presenting themselves as a “bipartisan” option for national unity and a Bloomberg Mussolini candidacy. The trio wrote on Feb. 1 to The New York Times , “In the coming months, we will put a spotlight on the nation’s infrastructure shortfalls. Our country needs a new, independent approach to infrastructure, one that provides sufficient financing. . . .” Within weeks of such proclamations, the financial blow- out has reached the stage that this trio no longer has even a semblance of backing up its Mussolini pitch to save the day, and provide private funds. Rohatyn’s fascist financier friends have got to steal the infrastructure from the American people who built it; they are not able to buy it now. That’s the reason for Rohatyn’s pushing a National Infrastructure Bank for $60 billion in public funds to “leverage” private capital invest - ments—i.e., bail them out. Here are snapshot views of the leading projects: Chicago Skyway, 2005. The 7.8-mile Chicago Skyway, opened in 1958, was sold by the city for $1.82 billion for a 99- year lease in January 2005. The buyers were Macquarie Infra - structure Group (MIG) and Cintra Concesiones de Infrae - structuras de Transporte, S.A., operating as one conglomerate called, “State Mobility Partners.” With a cash-up-front deal, the city saw its bond ratings jump to their highest levels in about 25 years; just after the Skyway sell-off, Chicago’s $5.5 billion of general obligations bonds hit double AA. Goldman Sachs advised on the sale, making a reported $9 million. Cintra-Macquarie is to maintain the Skyway, for which they get the tolls.

In February this year, the latest hike raised tolls 7-9%. Chicago continued to be strapped for revenue, and so in 2006, Mayor Richard Daley next sold off its city-owned park - ing system of 9,600 spaces—the largest such municipal ga - rage asset in the nation—to Morgan Stanley for $563 million. Daley is also shopping out Midway Airport, one of the most heavily used municipal airports in the country, to potential buyers. Mayor Daley was a prominent participant in Felix Ro - hatyn’s 1999 U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting on “inno - vative global financing” for cities. In 2004, Wall Street banker Dana R. Levenson became Chicago’s chief finance officer, and promoter of the Skyway sale—the first of its kind in the United States. By 2007, Levenson went on to become a man - aging director of the Royal Bank of Scotland, to engineer more infrastructure sell-offs. Indiana East-West Toll Road, 2006. This 157-mile toll road connects Illinois and Ohio. Opened in 1956, it is part of the main highway corridor linking Chicago to the Eastern Seaboard. In June 2006, a 75-year lease was sold, for $3.85 billion up front, to the consortium called ITR Concession Co. LLC, which is made up of Macquarie Infrastructure Group (MIG) and Cintra. The sale was approved by only a one-vote margin in the state legislature earlier this year. Gov. Mitch Daniels, who forced it through, was a former Office of Man - agement and Budget Director under George W. Bush. Trans-Texas Corridor, State Highway (SH) 130 High - way Section, 2006. The 4,000-mile Trans-Texas Corridor (TTC) plan was unveiled in January 2002 by Gov. Rick Perry (R), to mandate a grid of highways, rail, and utility lines, based on state funding authority for the benefit of private con - cessionaires. Texas state law had to be changed to permit state indebtedness and financing for this public/private dealing. Cost estimates ranged from $30 billion to $175 billion over the decades of building. In 2005, a contract was signed by TxDot (Texas Depart - ment of Transportation) and a consortium of Cintra and Texas-based Zachry for work on the giant TTC plan, involv - ing five toll roads. In 2006, the concession was granted for the first task, Segments 5 and 6 of State Highway 130 (SH 130), of 40 miles between San Antonio and north Austin, for $1.3 billion from Cintra/Zachry, in exchange for 50 years of tolling rights. In the face of fierce public opposition, the legislature acted in April 2007, to put a two-year moratorium on any pri - vate equity toll projects in Texas. Adding to the general scandal, Governor Perry’s legisla - tive director, Dan Shelley, had to leave office, when it was found that he was a consultant for Cintra beginning in Decem - ber 2003, nine months before he became a top Perry aide, af - ter which Cintra got the top contract.

This 8.7-mile north-south tollway, which opened last November, links California State Route 905, adjacent to the Mexican border, with Bonita to the north, avoiding the current highway congestion in the San Diego area.

This view shows toll stations for the 14-mile Dulles Greenway Toll Road in 1995, the year it opened. It runs westward from Dulles International Airport, through the northern Virginia commuter belt. Greenway was built as a private toll road from scratch. It came about in 1988, when a syndicate of investors was granted a 40-year conces - sion agreement to build a private extension of a highway past Dulles International Airport, instead of allowing the Virginia Department of Transportation to proceed on its already planned roadway extension. The project was marked by delays and financial losses foisted on the state. Then came insolvency and a shuffling among shareholders—including by Kellogg, Brown & Root/ Halliburton, and a sequence of three private operators. The state kicked in an additional 20-year toll concession, and in 2005, Macquarie Infrastructure Group acquired the roadway and the more than 51 years of remaining tolls. Despite all this, the Greenway is still called a “national model” for toll road PPPs. The charge is $3.20 for a one-way 14-mile trip. The FDR Precedent Constitution Invoked To Solve Bank Crisis When President Franklin Delano Roosevelt took office March 3, 1933, more than 25% of the American workforce was offi - cially unemployed, banks and businesses were falling like dominoes, and the nation was enmired in depression, both physically and in spirit. FDR moved instantly and vigorously to restore confidence in the U.S. banking system, and to set the basis for reviving the economy. Under his bold leadership, this was the most dense period of executive action in U.S. his - tory, and represented the first steps to reviving the principle of the General Welfare in the U.S. government. On March 5, FDR issued two Executive Orders. One called Congress into a special sesison on March 9; the second declared a National Banking Holiday, from March 6 to March 9, and gave special powers to the Secretary of the Treasury to prevent transactions in gold and foreign exchange. By the time the special session began, a draft Emergency Banking Act had been prepared for presentation. The Banking Act set up three categories of banks: Sound banks could reopen without problems; troubled banks could be aided either by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation or the Federal Reserve. The RFC would now purchase capital (stock equity) and capital notes of troubled banks, thus capi - talizing the troubled banks, without adding to their debts. The Act also authorized the district Federal Reserve banks to dis - count previously ineligible assets, and to issue new Federal Reserve notes against them, thereby increasing liquidity for the economy as a whole. And it instructed the Comptroller of the Currency to name receivers for the purpose of shutting down banks that were insolvent. The Banking Act was passed and signed in record time, by 8:37 p.m. on Thursday, March 9. The banks were set to begin opening on Monday, March 13. But before that occurred, President Roosevelt took an even more effective political action to restore the confidence of the nation: His first Fireside Chat, held Sunday night, March 12, drew an estimated audience of 60 million Ameri - cans. On Monday, March 13, many banks did reopen, and by March 15, fully 70% of the nationally chartered banks were open for business, without needing aid from the RFC. In this current period—where the breakdown of the finan - cial system globally dwarfs the crisis which the world faced in 1933—the U.S. does not have a President who is willing to use his Constitutional powers to defend the General Welfare, by"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"March 14, 2008 EIR Economics 61 carrying out the banking reorganization which FDR did. Thus, similar measures cannot be taken. However, it is of crit - ical importance that Americans once again comprehend the Constitutional principles which permitted FDR to take the ac - tions he did, and which would permit the Congress to exert its responsibility, for example, in passing the Homeowners and Bank Protection Act. Through the Preamble to the Constitution, and the spe - cific powers allotted to Congress, the Federal government has not only the right, but the obligation to provide a functioning credit system, which will service the general welfare for our nation’s citizens and their posterity. Our Constitution puts men before markets. In that spirit, we reprint FDR’s Fireside Chat of March 12, 1933, issued 75 years ago. FDR’s First Fireside Chat I want to talk for a few minutes with the people of the United States about banking—with the comparatively few who understand the mechanics of banking but more particu - larly with the overwhelming majority who use banks for the making of deposits and the drawing of checks. I want to tell you what has been done in the last few days, why it was done, and what the next steps are going to be. I recognize that the many proclamations from State Capitols and from Washing - ton, the legislation, the Treasury regulations, etc., couched for the most part in banking and legal terms, should be explained for the benefit of the average citizen. I owe this in particular because of the fortitude and good temper with which every - body has accepted the inconvenience and hardships of the banking holiday. I know that when you understand what we in Washington have been about I shall continue to have your cooperation as fully as I have had your sympathy and help during the past week. First of all, let me state the simple fact that when you deposit money in a bank, the bank does not put the money into a safe deposit vault. It in - vests your money in many different forms of cred - it-bonds, commercial paper, mortgages and many other kinds of loans. In other words, the bank puts your money to work to keep the wheels of industry and of agriculture turning around. A comparatively small part of the money you put into the bank is kept in currency—an amount which in normal times is wholly sufficient to cover the cash needs of the average citizen. In other words, the total amount of all the currency in the country is only a small fraction of the total deposits in all of the banks. What, then, happened during the last few days of February and the first few days of March? Because of undermined confidence on the part of the public, there was a general rush by a large portion of our population to turn bank deposits into currency or gold—a rush so great that the soundest banks could not get enough currency to meet the demand. The reason for this was that, on the spur of the moment, it was, of course, impossible to sell perfectly sound assets of a bank and convert them into cash, except at panic prices far below their real value. By the afternoon of March 3, scarcely a bank in the coun - try was open to do business. Proclamations temporarily clos - ing them in whole or in part had been issued by the Governors in almost all the states. It was then that I issued the proclama - tion providing for the nation-wide bank holiday, and this was the first step in the Government’s reconstruction of our finan - cial and economic fabric. The second step was the legislation promptly and patrioti - cally passed by the Congress, confirming my proclamation and broadening my powers, so that it became possible, in view of the requirement of time, to extend the holiday and lift the ban of that holiday gradually. This law also gave authority to develop a program of rehabilitation of our banking facili - ties. I want to tell our citizens in every part of the Nation that the national Congress—Republicans and Democrats alike— showed by this action a devotion to public welfare and a real - ization of the emergency and the necessity for speed that it is difficult to match in our history. The third stage has been the series of regulations permit - ting the banks to continue their functions to take care of the distribution of food and household necessities and the pay - ment of payrolls. This bank holiday, while resulting in many cases in great inconvenience, is affording us the opportunity to supply the currency necessary to meet the situation. No sound bank is a dollar worse off than it was when it closed its doors last Mon - day. Neither is any bank which may turn out not to be in a po - Franklin D.

The new law allows the twelve Federal Reserve banks to issue additional currency on good assets and thus the banks that reopen will be able to meet ev - ery legitimate call. The new currency is being sent out by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in large volume to every part of the country. It is sound currency because it is backed by actual, good assets. A question you will ask is this: Why are all the banks not to be reopened at the same time? The answer is simple. Your Government does not intend that the history of the past few years shall be repeated. We do not want and will not have another epidemic of bank failures. As a result, we start tomorrow, Monday, with the opening of banks in the twelve Federal Reserve Bank cities—those banks which on first examination by the Treasury have al - ready been found to be all right. This will be followed on Tuesday by the resumption of all their functions by banks al - ready found to be sound in cities where there are recognized clearinghouses. That means about 250 cities of the United States. On Wednesday and succeeding days, banks in smaller places all through the country will resume business, subject, of course, to the Government’s physical ability to complete its survey. It is necessary that the reopening of banks be extended over a period in order to permit the banks to make applica - tions for necessary loans, to obtain currency needed to meet their requirements, and to enable the Government to make common sense checkups. Let me make it clear to you that if your bank does not open the first day you are by no means justified in believing that it will not open. A bank that opens on one of the subsequent days is in exactly the same status as the bank that opens tomor - row. I know that many people are worrying about State banks not members of the Federal Reserve System. These banks can and will receive assistance from member banks and from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. These state banks are following the same course as the national banks except that they get their licenses to resume business from the state au - thorities, and these authorities have been asked by the Secre - tary of the Treasury to permit their good banks to open up on the same schedule as the national banks. I am confident that the state banking departments will be as careful as the Nation - al Government in the policy relating to the opening of banks and will follow the same broad policy. It is possible that when the banks resume, a very few peo - ple who have not recovered from their fear may again begin withdrawals. Let me make it clear that the banks will take care of all needs—and it is my belief that hoarding during the past week has become an exceedingly unfashionable pastime. It needs no prophet to tell you that when the people find that they can get their money—that they can get it when they want it for all legitimate purposes—the phantom of fear will soon be laid. People will again be glad to have their money where it will be safely taken care of, and where they can use it con - veniently at any time. I can assure you that it is safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than under the mattress. The success of our whole great national program depends, of course, upon the cooperation of the public—on its intelli - gent support and use of a reliable system. Remember that the essential accomplishment of the new legislation is that it makes it possible for banks more readily to convert their assets into cash than was the case before. More liberal provision has been made for banks to borrow on these assets at the Reserve Banks, and more liberal provision has also been made for issu - ing currency on the security of those good assets. This cur - rency is not fiat currency. It is issued only on adequate securi - ty—and every good bank has an abundance of such security. One more point before I close. There will be, of course, some banks unable to reopen without being reorganized. The new law allows the Government to assist in making these re - organizations quickly and effectively and even allows the Government to subscribe to at least a part of new capital which may be required. I hope you can see from this elemental recital of what your government is doing, that there is nothing complex, or radical in the process. We had a bad banking situation. Some of our bankers had shown themselves either incompetent or dishon - est in their handling of the people’s funds. They had used the money entrusted to them in speculations and unwise loans. This was of course not true in the vast majority of our banks, but it was true in enough of them to shock the people for a time into a sense of insecurity, and to put them into a frame of mind where they did not differentiate, but seemed to assume that the acts of a comparative few had tainted them all. It was the Government’s job to straighten out this situation and do it as quickly as possible—and the job is being performed. I do not promise you that every bank will be reopened, or that individual losses will not be suffered, but there will be no losses that possibly could be avoided; and there would have been more and greater losses had we continued to drift. I can even promise you salvation for some, at least, of the sorely pressed banks. We shall be engaged not merely in reopening sound banks but in the creation of sound banks through reor - ganization. It has been wonderful to me to catch the note of confi - dence from all over the country. I can never be sufficiently grateful to the people for the loyal support they have given me in their acceptance of the judgment that has dictated our course, even though all of our processes may not have seemed clear to them. After all, there is an element in the readjustment of our financial system more important than currency, more important than gold, and that is the confidence of the people. Confidence and courage are the essentials of success in carry - ing out our plan. You people must have faith; you must not be stampeded by rumors or guesses. Let us unite in banishing fear. We have provided the machinery to restore our financial system; it is up to you to support and make it work. It is your problem no less than it is mine. Together we cannot fail."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"March 14, 2008 EIR Economics 63 Business Briefs Finance Italy’s Tremonti Urges ‘A New Bretton Woods’ Former Italian Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti proposed a “new Bretton Woods” financial system, during a talk show March 6 on Raidue national television. He said that deteriorating labor conditions in Italy and the collapse of purchasing power are due to “the folly of globalization,” a folly invented “by a group of madmen, of mad illuminati, who decided in the last two decades to di - vide the world in two parts: Asia for low- cost production, and the U.S.A. and Europe for consumption. The result is that the situa - tion has worsened for them and will be, in the end, worse for Asia too.” “Globalization has failed. The crisis will get much worse,” he continued. The so - lution does not lie solely in one country: “We are thinking about an agreement among large nations, like the one in Bretton Woods: a new Bretton Woods.” Tremonti is the author of a new book, Fear and Hope ( La paura e la speranza ), a critique of the free-market policies which have brought the world to this extreme cri - sis. Corporatism Felix Rohatyn Calls for ‘New Global Regulator’ Financier Felix Rohatyn, currently vice chairman of Lehman Brothers, explained his plan for a fascist new world order, in an interview published in France’s leading economic daily, Les Echos , on Feb. 11. Ro - hatyn called for a “new global regulator, capable of imposing regulations and speak - ing with a single voice,” to deal with what he described as far more than “just another crisis.” In a sophistical appeal to Franklin Roos - evelt’s New Deal, he revealed what his idea of the New Deal is: “Today, we need a new New Deal. It reminds me somehow of the middle of the seventies, when the city of New York was about to go bankrupt. Helmut Schmidt and Valery Giscard d’Estaing had warned us: a bankruptcy of New York risked provoking a dollar crash. The crisis we con - front today is much more global. That is something frightening.” Rohatyn was brought in to “save” New York City at that time, as head of Big MAC (the Municipal Assistance Corporation), which turned over the control of the city’s finances from its elected officials to the banks, to ensure debt payments at the ex - pense of wages, services, industry, and in - frastructure. In his interview, Rohatyn in effect called for a global dictator (himself?), say - ing the problem today is that “finance has been globalized . . . but the control struc - tures, they have not adapted. Taken sepa - rately, each central bank is too isolated and follows its own policy. America lowers its rates. Europe doesn’t. We might need a more global regulator.” He also spelled out his corporatist scheme for infrastructure, making explicit that the key is the private sector use of pub - lic funds (see article by Marcia Merry Bak - er, in this section). He said the United States needs a “domestic World Bank” with $60 billion in Federal funds, “which could then raise funds and lend money to finance great projects. It never would lend more than 50% of the investment, in order to maintain a strong relation to the private sector.” Agriculture Threat of Food Crisis Worries India, Pakistan Concern about the rapid rise in food prices, and shortage of food grains, has begun to appear on the Indian Subcontinent. New Delhi has imposed new restrictions on ex - port of lower-priced rice varieties: Only those varieties which fetch more than $650 per ton on the international market will be allowed for export. In Pakistan, Naeem Butt, chairman of the private All Pakistan Flour Mills Associ - ation, said, “the government may have to import between 1 and 2 million tons of wheat to meet requirements.” Pakistan will miss its wheat output target of 24 million tons for the 2007-08 crop year. Late sowing, a fall in the area planted with wheat, a short - age of irrigation water, and rising fertilizer prices are reasons for the lower output. Naeem Butt pointed out that nearly 1 mil - lion tons of wheat finds its way to neighbor - ing Afghanistan. The latest report of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says that wheat stem rust has been found in Iran. It is one of the most devastating of plant diseas - es: During the 1950s, a different strain of the stem rust destroyed over 25% of the North American wheat crop, in one growing season. Major wheat-producing nations to Iran’s east, including Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakstan, should be on high alert, the FAO said. Inflation Chinese Officials Fear Crisis Will Get Worse Inflation is seen as the most immediate threat to the stability of the Chinese econo - my. The Chinese press has repeatedly raised the question of just how effective the gov - ernment’s “tight monetary policy” is, given that there has been no resolution of the country’s problems of excessive liquidity, trade surplus, and rising prices. National Development and Reform Commission Minister Ma Kai said on March 6 that the measures taken in the wake of the 1998-99 Asian financial crisis prevented what could have been “unthink - able” consequences. China reversed its shrinking grain harvests, and produced “bumper” harvests in each of the past five years—“something rarely seen in Chinese history.” Overheated and “haphazard” in - vestment has been brought under control, and steps taken toward shifting the econo - my away from its export-dependence to developing its huge internal capacity. Had these control measures not been taken, “se - rious” inflation and “drastic fluctuations” would already be far worse than they are, Ma Kai said. "},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"64 Editorial EIR March 14, 2008 Editorial As in the wake of the Hoover Depression of 1929-1933, so today, Europe and the U.S.A. are menaced again by fascist threats, from without and within. Then, President Franklin Roosevelt saved the United States from a fas - cist takeover, and led the economic mobilization which enabled us to crush fascism in Europe. Today, the only visible and potent force for FDR-like policies is Lyndon LaRouche, and his associates, who lead the battle to re - institute those policies in the United States, and Europe. Through a critical leadership intervention by La - Rouche and his youth movement, especially, in the Tex - as and Ohio primaries, in alliance with other patriotic forces, the potential for getting a U.S. Presidency that will embrace FDR has greatly increased. But this poten - tial will only be realized with a vast escalation of the campaign to educate leaders worldwide in both the real dangers, and the real opportunities, of the present situa - tion. Don’t let anyone deny the danger of fascism today! This is not an academic question for debate. Not only is the dire state of bankruptcy of the world financial system obviously driving leading financiers to demand fascist austerity and controls, but the Bloombergs, Rohatyns, and Shultz-Schwarzeneggers of this world are right out front, demanding Mussolini-style corporatist policies. There could be no clearer example than Felix Ro - hatyn, the fascist banker who has led the drive within the Democratic Party to try to extirpate FDR’s policies, spe - cifically as they are put forward by LaRouche. Rohatyn “came out” again in February, in an interview with France’s leading economic daily Les Echoes , calling for the creation of a new “global regulator, capable of im - posing regulations and speaking with a single voice,” to deal with what he called a “dangerous,” “worrisome,” and “frightening” deep financial crisis. What would such a “global regulator” do? Rohatyn specifically compared the job to that which he personally carried out in New York City, through “Big MAC.” In the 1970s, the Big MAC program ripped up democratic government in the city, and imposed a regime which devastated wages, services, and infrastructure, all in the interest of assuring “financial solvency” of the bankrupt banks. Such is the policy which Rohatyn, a godfather of the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile, recommends now be carried out on a global scale. Rohatyn did not shirk from spelling out his corporat - ist infrastructure scheme as well—the one that he shares with London’s choice for U.S. dictator, Michael Bloom - berg, and California “Governator” Arnold Schwarzeneg - ger. While lyingly comparing his plan with FDR’s New Deal, fascist Felix makes clear that his “domestic World Bank” would have the Federal government provide funds to the private sector for its projects—the classic modus operandi of Mussolini corporatism. Why do Democrats in the United States tolerate this fascism? How is it possible that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is allowed to set up policy hearings featur - ing fascist Felix, without being run out of town? How can the banker who personally acted to shut down the U.S. auto industry in 2005, not to mention destroy New York City, be tolerated? The answer can only be the weakness of those forces within the Democratic Party, and elsewhere, in fighting for the Franklin Roosevelt approach to rebuilding our nation, and the world monetary system as a whole. But the time for tolerating this weakness is running out. The window of opportunity is now—and, if action is not tak - en, it will close shut, potentially for generations to come. There is every reason for optimism that the Ameri - can people will respond to genuine leadership on behalf of an FDR program. The national momentum around La - Rouche’s Homeowners and Bank Protection Act is one indication of such a response. Another is the extraordi - nary turnouts in recent Presidential primaries, which demonstrate the acute attention which the electorate, in - cluding those in the lower 80% of income brackets, are paying to this crucial election. If LaRouche’s economic program were taken up directly, this would increase even more. Over the coming weeks, the LaRouche movement will put the choice starkly before the world: Mussolini, or FDR? How people respond will literally determine the future of the human race.
